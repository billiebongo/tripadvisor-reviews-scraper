Good food and experience but a tad overpriced. Requested for a table outdoors 3 weeks prior but didn't get it when we got there. However despite the crowd, service was efficient and staff were polite. We all had a good experience overall.
2
Food has too much MSG. Till all of us were drinking water the entire night. Service staffs totally ignored us when we called for them, very bad service this time round.
1
One of the worst services I've had in any place. We were sited right away, but then for 30 minutes wouldn't even be served drinks after multiple reminders to our waitress. The restaurant was half full.
5
The most succulent chilli crabs in Singapore best dipped with the buns given for the sublime experience. Choose the deep fried buns. A verity if live seafood are also available like steam fish and drunken prawns
5
It’s a must go-to seafood restaurant whenever my overseas friend’s visit Singapore for the first time. Great customer service and above average food.
4
Very nice fish cuisine. Locals seem to really appreciate. Advance booking strongly recommended. Prices are stiff but worth the try at least once. I don't know how their fish is we only tried crabs.Attention their chilly sauce is spicy beyond imagination!kind personnel good WiFi. Recommende

i was visiting singapore with family and we wanted to get out of the downtown/marina bay areas and see something different so we went out to Jumbo's. Everyone at our table thought their food was very average. The chili crab is ok but a huge mess and very much effort for very little food. nevertheless we all enjoyed the experience primarily because it was so pleasant to sit out on the beach and enjoy the scenery and fresh air. having said that, if you are going to experience the atmosphere, i recommend very strongly that you show up 15 minutes or so before they open so you can request a table right on the 'front row' to the beach. otherwise, it is a sea of tables and you will likely end up without much views

There are a lot of temp set up tables but the lighting is poor. We can't even see the menu until we have to use our mobile light to shine on it. We nearer to the bushes so we feel that there are insect bites & itch. The Staff is not attentive enough as we are trying to give a little birthday surprise (video and sing birthday song) to the birthday gal when she back to the table. The staff just dash out from nowhere to clear the plates on table. Even my friend just told the staff that she spoilt the surprise, she just continue clearing everything that include the birthday gal standing by the side. I think the staff could have been done better like saying sorry and if she could continue to clear the plates or come back later.

Jumbo is really a name in Singapore seafood. We are visiting it for good seafood and getting it. However, if you try to order there anything that is on seasonal price (crab, lobster) - better stop!!!The final bill will be sky-high and you will never and ever feel that you paid 200-300-400 dollars for a dish because it was exceptionally delicious and served to you in stylish and cozy interiors. NOYou will get regular crab or lobster (and those are always delicious, you know). You will it this regular food in the food-court surrounding. Amount of food will be enough at max for 1.5 persons and at the end you will pay enormous bill. Trust me! I gave it several tries. Limit yourself to the position where you see prices. Order small portions (medium and big options are often too large) and you will get very nice seafood dinne

Had dinner there with my family. The food there are quite expensive, especially their famous Chilli Crab at $88 per kg (probably due to Chinese New Year period). The food there is generally nice. Service is quick too. If the weather is good, I would highly recommend outdoor sitting as you get to enjoy the sea view, sea Breeze, setting sun and the landing planes
2
Busy, rude staff. Food was good, not great, and quite expensive - there are a lot better places to eat in Singapore
5
Great meal with colleagues who had turned into friends by the end of my week in Singapore. Lots of great dishes and you will not go hungry. They cater for all tastes, including vegans, but you’ll need to make them aware of this.
4
Nice location near to the sea but unfortunately seats near sea is not able to reserve as we have 20 paxs. Overall enjoyed our food especially their famous pepper and chili crab. Yummy.
4
Chilli crab a real winner here, big size crab, thick gravy with good level of spiciness and balance of taste. It's not cheap but definitely worthy. Place always packed so try to come earlier or book ahead.
5
The food quality is excellent over here. We enjoyed delicious crabs and some other good dishes over there
4
Good service and good food.
A little bit over crowded but that how it's a late evening at one of Singapores restaurant.
4
Perhaps the temperature set is too low, food get cold soon after served. It more or less affect the beauty of the dish...

Jumbo Seafood has a reputation for good and fresh seafood. The Soon Hock fish was actually our favourite dish as it was prepared really well, followed closely by the pepper crab which was not too spicy or overwhelming with pepper. I will say although these two dishes were good, it was more expensive than expected (especially the fish which had a seasonal pricing). The sambal kang kong and Yang Chow fried rice were decently priced but the quality was just short of stellar. I will say that the plus points are the ambience (I love the outdoors and the sea breeze) and the service (all severs and receptionists were prompt despite the crowd). Speaking of a crowd, if you are going on weekends, always book in advance; the walk-in crowds that night were massive and especially so with outdoor tables closed off due to the rain

Our party of four considered booking Long Beach opposite but opted for Jumbo instead - I wish we hadn't. The food was great and I love Black Pepper crab but this whole meal was ruined by terrible service.We had reserved a table for 8pm and rocked up 10 minutes early. We stood in the queue for pre booked people for 20 minutes as they took parties of all sizes from behind us in the queue and seated them ahead of us.When we were finally seated the handover to the waiting staff was not properly performed as we received no menus and had we not flagged someone down we would probably still be waiting now. In fact people who were seated after us were getting their food before we got our menus and even then they only gave us two menus (for four people).When we got the menus the wait staff disappeared before we could order drinks. When we finally wrestled them back to our table they brought our drinks and then disappeared before we could order food. We had to wrestle them back to order food.Finally when we wanted to order food it was a complete charade as a number of items weren't on the menu. Then when we ordered the crab she said "too small". So we said two crabs ...."too small"...and she pointed to the King crab. Bear in mind we had a number of dishes ordered already. In the end we told her two crabs would be fine.Then no bibs or wet wipes were provided so we had to ask for them.We then had to wrestle them down to order dessert.I just wouldn't bother. Long Beach is in my opinion better in terms of service and food
5
Recommended to this restaurant by a friend who used to live nearby. It is the original Jumbo restaurant. Chilli crab was fantastic. Was worried in case the chilli would overpower the crab but it didn't disappoint - a great balance of flavour. Very messy but they provided all the necessary implements and a bib! Great service from a very young girl
4
We went to Jumbo Seafood for a group dinner. The food was great, especially the pepper crab and chili crab. The drunken shrimp were also very good. We ate outside with a nice view of the water.
5
good for company and family dinner. not so expensive. must order chilli crab and black pepper crab. the grilled fish is also very tasty.
2
The Captain JoJo started our fantastic dining pleasure from recommending menu, friendly chats, making sure the right orders were delivered and sending us upon departure. Tip Top service received frm JoJo.
4
Great location, great food. Thoroughly recommend and especially great for the wider variety of dishes on offer. An authentic experience
4
This is the place known for its sea food delicious items.Must try salt and pepper crab.must visit place in singapore for all the seafood lover
5
The food and service was really good. Food was given promptly. The atmosphere was also good and by the beach,
4
Jumbo Seafood restaurant needs no introduction and has been around for decades. Its seaside location in East Coast gives it a casual and carefree ambience. When we arrived for dinner, the outdoor seating terrace was almost fully occupied in the cool evening. We chose the air-conditioned dining area on the second floor.We ordered the 6-course dinner package with yusheng to welcome Chinese New Year eventhough it was weeks away. The dishes were served progressively. The portions were generous. The yusheng, soup and chilly crab were very good. The crab meat offered bites of freshness. The fried rice had "wok-hei" which refers to the slightly charred flavor from cooking with very high heat
4
The ambience is open air beside the water, with pleasant evening breezes. It tends to be very crowded and noisy. Better to make reservations in advance or it will be difficult to wait for a table. The food is really yummy except for very poor service since there are always crowds and not enough servers
3
Whilst the Dempsey outlet seems posh and upper-class, this east coast one is more like a mob boss hangout. That said, there is no price difference apparently. Food standards varies quite greatly from branch to brach too, so it's not just the atmosphere. Service.. well this is Singapore with high turn over rates so one should not be coming in with high expectations anyway. Overall its a matter of luck, really
1
The crabs we ordered were of lousy quality on the day of our visit. We ordered 8 dishes and the only average dish in our opinion is the spring onion vension. All the other regular dishes which we used to order when we frequent Jumbo were all not to our standard anymore. In conclusion, we have other choices out there who serves better quality seafood. It's over rated among patrons
4
Came here for chili crab as everyone else, and it's very good! Also had fried whole fish with spicy sauce, and also good. Huge place and it's crowded on a Friday night among locals & visitors. Efficient Chinese style service. Average price; hey, it's Singapore!
4
I always go to Jumbo to eat crabs. They are delicious. My favourite is the black pepper crab, although the chilly crab is nice too. The service is always efficient.
5
Love the crab and yam rings!! Prawns were really fresh as well! It was really crowded on a Friday evening, it started to rain and they efficiently shifted us to an inner table!

This restaurant is known for the original Chili Crab and widely marketed as such. Tour buses stop near it increasing its commerciality and tourist popularity. But ask any local and they will tell you that this place is highly over-priced and over-rated. So, since my last visit 5years ago, I decided to find out for myself. My experience confirmed the sentiments of locals and uber drivers as this place charges $9p/100gr for the crab dish. the dish is now catering to the mild palette and not a Chili crab at all. it is tomatoey and full of egg. Service is cold and slow and unpleasant and made our party feel we were another table ticked off at the till. We were told it would take 40minutes to prepare at a time when there were very few other guests at 10pm.. Compare this to the underdogs who serve genuine chili crab at $6.50p/100gr and cooked freshly and served within 10minutes- these are the true local places and the owner managed places where the patronage is appreciated, you are treated with service with a smile!!! So, shop around and you will be amazed at what others have to offer. the only positive about this place is its location -- right at Clark Quay... on the Singapore River- so if you want the view , go there but if you want genuine signature dish, look around and the options are endless!
3
We went to Jumbo East Coast on a Thursday night. It was fairly busy but not overcrowded. Service was average. The Chilli crab and other dishes were average.I would say it once was a great restaurant but now that we have many fine restaurants it is just average
5
Restaurant is always packed during weekends. Do reserve a table early if you have more diners. Might have to take a cab to reach the restaurant as it is not accessible by public bus. Will see many joggers, people walking by the beach. Have a feel of the seaside ambience
3
I had dinner there when I and my boyfriend visited East Coast park. Bamboo clam was good but it's expensive, $16/piece. We also ordered black pepper crab and it's so expensive, $128/dish ,while the taste was so so. I think you can find good seafood somewhere else but not so expensive as this restaurant
3
chilli crab. black pepper crab. cereal shrimp. coconut. ... many many. All these are all year long signature dishes. I enjoyed having dinner in Jumbo. And every time there is a guest from overseas, the first place we want to bring them to is Jumbo. Not to forget all the staff has a very good attitude in serving the guest. I like that. However, the price is increasing. I can see that per head has increased 20-30% comparing to 3-4 years back. I am not sure if the price increment is due to what reason, but really I can sense that.
5
To be honest, my family goes to Jumbo ever so often for celebrations and gatherings, I may have a slightly biased opinion.But look at the droves of people flocking to it most evenings/weekends, and perhaps you'll believe what I have to say about it. If you're a foreigner looking for a taste that's uniquely Singapore, this offers both a tasty and visually stunning treat.Jumbo strategically faces the seaside, where you get to view the many ships awaiting off our shores to call on our world class port. Looking out, you can enjoy the sea breeze, and gain a glimpse as to how Singapore got to be the country it is today. On the more important topic of food: the famous chilli crab, black pepper crab, deep fried tilapia with Nonya sauce, and the remainder of a wide selection of dishes from the sea and land, I suspect you'll be too spoilt for choice. And what better way to eat chilli crab than with your hands! Jumbo offers bibs for all willing to dig in to crab claws with their paws. I dare say this dish is finger lickin' good, more so than a certain other poultry franchise
5
Even though I have been to Jumbo many many times, Food quality is always maintained, service was fast because we went there on a weekday. Recommend to all my friends who come to Singapore to try Jumbo. Yes price is a little bit on the high side, around $30-40 per head depending on what you order, but its worth it.
5
A lot to choose from seafood diet for sure. Loved the shrimps,crabs,and different ways of serving , great servers
5
I came this restaurant with a friend. I was shock with the quality of crab here. I wish i could come back Singapore right now just to eat this. So amazing place amazing food
5
The chili crab and black pepper crab were very delicious. The shrimp with salt egg yolk was so good too. A bit pricey but worth the money. Will come again if I visit Singapore again.
4
Good and attentive service rendered. Had their infamous chilli crab but it’s seems to me different branch does taste differently. Preferred the Riverwalk at Clarke Quay.
5
I love this place. Gotta admit it's one of the best places to eat chilli crab in Singapore. It is spicy though so please go prepared!
5
Although the outlet at east coast was very busy, their staff attention is 100%! They serve with a smile always and are always changing our plates with new ones. I had some issue with my jumbo membership and their supervisor Joan is so helpful and patient to help me resolve the issue. Thumbs up to the team at Jumbo East Coast! Good food + good service really leave a great dining experience for me and my husband
5
Can here with one of my Friend. Jumbo never disappoint me for chilli crab. I’m a Singaporean and I love their chilli crab! The way they cook is just perfect. To me, it ain’t too spicy Nor sweet. Plus, the venue was great! We were having dinner and get to see sunset here, dining by the beach.
5
Allowed only an hour and half for a meal so worried whether I should be in a hurry to eat up the dinner with my family before they call us. To the contrary, each food was served very fast and tasty. River view of Clarke quay was also enjoyable with many people walking around the road and bridg
4
Ate outside on a very pleasant evening We had the chili crabs which were very good . The little buns they give are fantastic for not missing any of the chili crab sauce . We had cereal prawns also which were good and a whole white bass done Hong Kong style. There are a few items but not many for the non seafood eaters .This is a pricey restaurant but supposedly has the original chili crabs. It was worth the visit Must have reservation as place was full on a Tuesday night 
5
Love the food here. You have to make a reservation to get a table since it is pretty busy even weekdays. Love the food here...Service can sometimes improve since it gets so busy and the staff seem to be overloaded. Last time had to wait so long for the dessert
5
We always enjoy Jumbo Seafood you n East Coast. Service is attentive, food great quality and a nice atmosphere next to the water.
3
Service is great. Ordered the black pepper crab but it wasn’t that great. The crab is very fresh but just too oily and the favour is overpowering ...
1
Was absolutely disappointed with the food quality. Extremely expensive. Photos in menu is a misrepresentation.
5
When I first started coming to Singapore used to go all the time. Lately
not great and even the chili crab not great. Last time tried the fish. Would not recommend it
4
Jumbo at NSRCC is a great place to be for great Chinese food. Especially delicious are the meat items... coffee pork ribs, lamb chops and beef dishes. To die for is the yam-scallop!! This Jumbo is very unique because it's situated in the 'countryside' of Singapore. It's surrounding is the seaside on one side, and a golf course on the other side.
4
We had guests from overseas and this place doesn't disappoint . A little pricey but its great service, location and quality make up for the price. We bring our own bottle and pay some corkage too. The staff are always at hand to help. Food comes fast and its super fresh. Portions are pretty decent compared to other restaurants that serve super small portions
5
Whenever I am travelling in Asia, I try to arrange a stopover in Singapore just to enjoy the chili crabs at Jumbo Seafood. I have had them elsewhere but no place makes them better than Jumbo as they combine the perfect amount of spice and sweetness with a perfect fresh crab
4
We had Christmas dinner here! Chilli crab, deep fried baby squid, kai lan & razor clams. Food was good, though the razor clams are over rated as a food. Luckily we thought to book a table as it poured with rain & the queues were long. Had it not been for the rain, the view of the Port of Singapore is great too
4
A restaurant with yummy huge crabs . We ordered Chilli crabs, black pepper crabs and steamed crabs.. and of course other yummy dishes like squid paste with fried fritters, herbal prawns , lobsters with crispy noodles, scallops with mini yam ring, etc etc.. since I have foreign guests I have also ordered some local specialty like satay and otah.. (though satay & otah weâ€™re not as good as those serve at the local hawker food centre, it is definitely good to let foreign guests have a taste of them.)This place has become a must visit place for my foreign guests.. PS: only if JUMBO can improve their service, it will be perfect
4
There was many customers and the restaurant was busy at the time we visited.But we could get through our dinner without any inconvenience thanks to the kind staffs and efficient system.I'll visit again and try another menu when I get to Singapore next time
4
Nice sea view dining experience where seating arrangement is closed to the beach, reasonable crowd n fresh seafood
5
We had the Chili Crab and a selection of other seafood. Everything was excellent cooked and very delicious. The service was great and friendly. We can recommend this restaurant very much
4
Great seafood restaurant with nice sea breeze and relax ambience. The service was slow and quite crowded on the weekend.
4
Been going to Jumbo for many years.
Must try their seafood, Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Grilled Fish Etc
Their Mee Goreng is also quite decent.
4
I loved the chilly crabs and this is the restaurant I took my overseas guests there for dinner with beach front facing view. Food was tasty especially the chilly crabs!
2
We were told to visit Jumbo while we were in Singapore, and when we arrived it was very busy and were told to wait. We didn’t have to wait very long , we were a party of three and they sat us on a table of 8 which was not very nice and was I told off for sitting right next to my daughter.The waiter who I think was in charge then tried to tell us that they had an offer on the lobster which came ‘free’ with a bottle of New Zealand wine. We said we wanted the Chilli crab , and he said “ chilli crab not that good “ but we stuck to our guns and ordered the crab, but he was not very happy. It was the most expensive meal we had on our 10 day stay ,but the service was the worst, The crab it self was very nice but I wouldn’t go back again, very rude service 
5
Jumbo lives up to its reputation!We had a few entree’s which were great. Baby squid and the salted duck egg prawns were particularly good.We shared two large mud crabs - one chilli and one pepper. Though the chilli crab was delicious, the pepper crab was an unexpected winner between the two. The meat in the claw was eye fillet size and the shell cracked just enough to let in the sauce.We were easily tempted into a third crab (pepper of course).This is a great place for groups - business, families or just friends catching up.As travellers, it was nice to find a place that delivers on the famed Singaporean chilli crab
5
I have visited this jumbo place with a group of 18 of our friends of various nationalities round the globe.Every one of us has tried all the types of crab dishes in this restaurant . Everything is as delicious as the other. A few first timers of the crab in us.But believe me we have never enjoyed sea food so much anywhere else.You will get what you pay for. Especially if you are with a family to singapore, worth a visit just to express your sense of taste to your loved ones.I will visit this place with my family in my next visit to this little country.Hey my mouth has been watering already in writing this review...This is the most satisfying review written ever.!!
4
This really is the place for amazing chilli crab - in spite of the commercialism it’s a must do! Only thing that stopped the 5 stars is that last time i visited they went heavy on the upsell and were a bit off when we declined. In truth one chilli crab between two is enough - it’s very filling.
5
One of the best places in Singapore where I had Chili Crab with Fried Pao. Prawns as a Starter also is a good option. Portion was Sufficient for two to share one plate, Fabulous taste. Got CITI 15% Discount also. Reservation is advisable otherwise waiting time is huge and probably have to share table with others in queue
5
The service is very good，and taste great.The staff also gave away other tastes，very nice，I will be there.
4
Jumbo is well known for their chilli crab, and a chilli (a large one, at that, weighing in at 1.8kg) we got! The accompaniments (fried man tou, etc) did not disappoint. Reservations for your crab of choice a must. Recommended!
4
Chilli crabs are excellent. Except for monsoon months, reserve a table outside of restaurant in the open air area facing the sea. If u sit by 7pm, can catch the sun setting n on clear days, can be very very nice.
3
The dishes so so but the price increased a lot. For tourist taste for the 1st time, maybe worth visiting
5
We went with a few friends as we stayed at Equarius hotel and wanted to have a nice seafood dinner out of the hotel.All of us decided to visit the restaurant on east coast and by far, they have the best black pepper crab as well as other selection pf seafood. As well the Chilli Crab was quite good, service fast and attentive.My recommendation is not to eat too much with the appetizers as the best is when you eat the crab either Chilli or Black pepper
5
I learned, after booking my vacation in Singapore, that it is famous for chilli crab and which is considered a local delicacy. And the place recommended was Jumbo Seafood by those seemingly in the know. And not the one in the centre of town - although that would indeed have been handy for our hotel - but the one out at East Coast. We booked a few days in advance which turned out to be critical as we wouldnâ€™t have got in on the day, and made our journey out there. And how worthwhile a trip it was. Great food and a fabulous experience all round.
5
The best sea food in town..Cant miss this one! Its expensive, YES!....costs as much as the dinner for 6 nights in little india or other hawker centers... but each bite of the food... reminds me the money was well spent...it has an open seating... so obvio. The view is beautiful...worth a visit
5
There are many items to order on the menu, to be very frank there is one reason to go to Jumbo Seafood restaurant. Black Pepper Crab! I have been going to Singapore for the last 25 years and this is my dish of choice. It is messy to eat and if that is enough to stop you, I would not go to eat this dish. If you like Black pepper, I believe you will find this one of your better meals. The crab is deep fried whole for around 15 minutes, taken out Inners of the Crab are removed, the legs are chopped into smaller pieces and then stir-fried in a wok with cups of East Malaysian black peppers (finest in the world) garlic. The contrast of the pepper to the sweet crab meat is exceptional
2
We ate here as a large group and ordered the $728 set menu. To be fair, most of the food was delicious. But service was lacking and it is rather difficult to get the attention of a wait staff for our needs. Apart from the set menu, we ordered extra as they messed up our order when we called and requested to have a set menu for 12 pax which was duly confirmed. When the crayfish arrived and it was short of 2 pieces, we realised that they did not make the menu for 12. So we ordered an extra black pepper crab. When the bill arrived, we were shocked at how expensive it was. Doubt i would ever go back again to be ''slaughtered''
5
The black pepper crab and chili crab is a must to order together with fried bun. The waiter is friendly, suggested many different kind of dishes for us to try and everyone of them is delicious! The chili crab is a little bit spicy but overall is acceptable especially it taste great when dipping it with the fried bun. Highly recommende
5
Food is good the service is not bad. Really like the Chili crab. Is a good place for family or friends gathering.
5
Excellent food and service
Good atmosphere with seaview
Casual dinner with fam
Nice service
Alaskan with discount
4
Although this is considered a bit ‘touristy’ by locals many still go and the food is excellent. The chilli and garlic king crab are the special dishes.
Great fun, worth booking if you can as it’s very busy but relatively expensive.
4
You have to try their famous chili crab
Avoid the weekend as service can be a bit slow
Certainly worth a visit
2
I have always preferred Jumbo and No Signboard for fuss-free, casual seafood for our monthly family gathering. Only the Jumbo at East Coast meets expectations — the RiverWalk outlet seems to hover between ok to bad.. it’s terribly frustrating
4
I was hosted by local friends and two first impressions are obvious:1.- This is a chain restaurant catering for hundreds of people, and with a factory assembly line atmosphere. So be prepared to be treated and taken care of as you would expect if you were a UPS parcel on a rush hour day.2.- The location, in itself a plus at least at this time of the year, makes some things painfully obvious: Jumbo is packed and with long waiting lines, and the other 5-6 similarly sized seafood restaurants in the same area are either empty or seem to be struggling to keep the appearance they are open.Due to the generosity of my hosts, by the time the star of the evening, the chili crab arrived, I was too full to do little more than give it a polite taste. My mistake, because this is some serious crab, nothing like the small pathetic “hairy” stuff in Hong Kong, which were obviously not made to be eaten because they have no meat or flavor. And that nevertheless are priced like Bitcoin.No, this is real King Crab. And not only steamed to perfection, but the sauce is superb. I do believe they have different levels of spices. But I asked to go for moderate and was not disappointed at all. The one thing I will do next time is:1.- Come again with local friends because I am not sure if I would get the same level of service or satisfaction as a mere alien.2.- Not touch any food or goodies appetisers or whatever and reserve all my energy and stomach space for the famous Singaporean chili crab. Worth it..

We got lots of recommendations from friends to visit Jumbo Seafood restaurant next to the sea so we decided to give it a try. The food is good but does not live up to its reputation. Will give it an average rating. The plus points include: fresh food, nice location next to the sea, large menu selection, air conditioned and non-air-conditioned rooms. The negative points include: over-rated quality, relatively expensive, over-crowded at dinner time, quite out of the way, and long taxi queues

My family and I went to Jumbo East Coast for dinner on 24 Dec 2017. We were seated on the 2nd level. Placed our order for chilli crab, salted egg crab and other dishes around 6.00pm. After we have finished our chilli crab and the other dishes, the salted egg crab was still not served, and the time was about 7.00pm. Asked a female service staff in blue uniform about the salted egg crab, she checked and told us we would have to wait for another 5 min. I told her our order was placed one hour ago and asked her why do we have to wait so long for the crab? Instead of apologizing for missing out the order, which is apparent, she gave us a stupid excuse as we were idiots. I quote her reply - "Mr, you must understand we use the same wok for cooking different types crab. We must cook the other types of crab first before cooking the salted egg crab." For the benefit of other customers, I hope the management of Jumbo can clarify the above statement made by the service staff.I told the same service staff, even if salted egg crab gets low priority in cooking, why after one hour it was still not served? Unable to give an explanation, she told us to talk to the service staff that took our orders and walked off. The service and attitude of the service staff is totally unacceptable. We would be glad to accept an apology for missing out the order which caused the delay in serving the salted egg crab but not some lame excuses to cover up the mistake! Gary Ta

We have ordered the pepper and chilli crab which turns out to be a disappointment. Overall the food taste not up to the standard the steam prawn was not too bad. The service was poor though we have to blame it on the bad weather. No drinks service and no changing of plates service. will not revisit if there are no special promo not worth the price
5
They really have the best chili crabs!! I am not supposed to eat this but I simply can’t resist and must eat here once when I am in town. Best Jumbo restaurant is in Dempsey where the queues are short compared to other branches if you forgot to make a reservation. Plus they have the friendliest staff there very accommodating and always smiling unlike those in Clark quay and river pointe where they seem to always discourage you to eat there if you didn’t make a reservation. Best time to go is late dinner 9pm onwards where the restaurant is not rowdy anymore and you can enjoy your chili crab in peace
5
Best seafood you can get by the sea side in Singapore.
Each and every dish is great but the cost is way high!
For family of 6 it has costed us around $400.....
4
Chilli crabs is a must, bamboo clams and steam fish are must try as well, Fresh and good seafood. Nice place to dine as a group, family or for business is good too. Have few branch, do call in advance to make reserations
5
My first visit to Jumbo at East Coast. Very nice food with good view to the seaside. Definitely will go again.
5
The food is excellent. The customer service is superb. Jumbo restaurant is really the best seafood restaurant. The crab and lobsters are great. The scallop is really worth it!
5
It is absolutely a great to have seafood. Will always bring overseas friends here. The black pepper crab and chili crab dishes are a must try.
4
The food quality is good however, the service level is just at average level . When I came to the resturant, the waiter was not so welcomed I guess there were too many people there.
4
I usually take friends n family to this outlet for Chilli n proper crab..I like the location by the seaside. The seat is very casual and tables are too close to each other but I sacrifice the discomfort for the good Chilli crab and the seaside view
3
This is supposed to be one of those great Singapore places. Personally, I was rather disappointed. We went there with my family and some friends that were visiting us in Singapore. The atmosphere is nice, although the chairs and tables seem to be very closely put together making it sometimes feel a little bit claustrophobic. Notwithstanding that, the place is clean and the staff are attentive (although most are mainland Chinese so their English is not the best). They have a very broad selection of food which is not only seafood (this is good if somebody in your party does not like seafood). The chili crab, which is supposed to be one of Singapore’s favorites, is a bit of a disappointment. If you’re expecting to taste the crab, you won’t! The reason for this is that there is so much chili powder in the gravy in which they put the crab that it practically obliterates the taste. As far as I’m concerned you could be eating anything. Also, I’m a bit suspicious about what type of crab or maybe it’s fish that actually goes in there. They do have fresh crab which is expensive but usually quite good. The crab comes from Thailand and the quality is good. They sometimes also have jumbo crab which comes from Alaska (amazingly!). This is ridiculously expensive.In conclusion, a good night out, food is not fantastic, but the atmosphere and location make it a worthwhile visit

Situated at East Coast which we can enjoy the breeze from the seaside. Ideally for overseas guests whether it's personal or business. Though am not a VIP member but my family has been patronizing this outlet for many years either for birthday or Chinese New Year celebrations. My family loved it very much. It might be a bit pricing but the service is considered good. Usually, we make reservations first to avoid disappointment
5
I have been a VIP member of Jumbo for many years and I have had both family and business meals in different outlets. Overall, the food quality has been good all the time. The East Coast one is good for families and guests from Asia as it shows high standard and stylish life of Singapore. The Clark Kay outlet is always crowded as it is in town and many tourist groups are there. Others are a bit out in terms of location. The must order dishes for me are chilly crab with bun, pepper crab, chilly Gan Gong, wasabi shrimp. The price has increased a lot and you always find there is not enough waiters/waitress due to the crowd. One bad thing is Jumbo started charging per bottle if you bring your own wine/alcohol. Even though, it is still the first choice to entertain my guests from overseas
4
Love the chili crab sauce for the buns! Even more foreign friends from SF loved the taste! Weather was perfect at the alfresco area with light breeze
1
Unfriendly staff. Food gets cold within minutes. Very expansive if you are taking family. Better to look for something similar at other place which values their customers.
5
Had a wonderfull meal here of crab and fish dishes.
Very friendly and helpfull staff.
A good friendly atmosphere too. I highly recomend it here.
4
Very good place to eat with the view of seaside.
they have outdoor or indoor, but best to choose outdoor if there is no rain.
their speciality is the singaporean chilly crab. you just have to try it
4
The chilli & salted egg crabs are super yummy! Much better than the previous round we went. Rest of the food we had were ok just that the sweet and sour pork is rather chunky and hard
5
Good for gathering with friends, can ask if there is any promotion of the crab. It's better to make a booking so you can get the best seat facing the shore
3
Each time I visited Singapore I used to visit Jumbo seafood to taste the Singapore Chillie crab.This was my 4th visit to Jumbo Seafood . I observe this time that Standards have dropped, Ordered my usual Singapore chillie Crab quality very average and not up to standard, service poor, over crowded. Its no longer the Jumbo seafood of 3 years ago. Its just a Hype now Very disappointed. No value for what was paid. Will not visit again
5
Been a supporter but yet not a regular. Staff could remember me cos there isn’t many botak girls around. They wow me that they remember our favourite table. It’s just awesome to be recognised no matter where one goes I supposed. I salute that jumbo East Coast has very awesome staffs
4
This is a Chinese style seafood restaurant. It’s non halal so not advisable for Muslim. Clean and nice restaurant. Jumbo is well known in Singapore for its Chilli crab. For Muslim, there is another restaurant few doors away also serve seafood and local food which is halal certified. The Enak Enak restaurant is equally good. Both restaurant has indoor aircon and outdoor seats. Best to have dinner and stroll by the coast after. Lunch will be a little warm there. Go for it!
4
The access is pretty hard to get using public transport, best is to take taxi.once you get there, they have the big view of the sea and large of seating area.they have the outdoor and indoor, but actually it's almost the same, and the roof is the only different.if you are sure that it's not going to rain, best to take the outdoor, you can feel the sea breeze and enjoying the view without obstruction.the food is very good, and their specialty is the singapore chilly crab, although all the other food are as equally good
5
Those who have been living in singapore know it is a food paradise. Jumbo seafood serves fresh seafood with different sauces. This is a must try for seafood lovers
5
Went to jumbo ecp. Despite the price is on the high side, the food and service is excellent despite the crowd! Good job Jumbo!
5
Went there for a seafood dining and the food is fabulous ! Service from stuff was excellent too! Will definitely go again ...
5
We love the crabs ordered! The other dishes were pretty good as well! :) Service was quick despite the crowd! :) Good experience overall!
5
What a Chilli crab. Very nice restaurant located near river bay, awesome view if Sat outside. Must try Chilli crab with fried bun and prawns. Service was good. Elegant staffs taking care of ur food and comfort.
5
When is come to seafood Jumbo know it's best! Best place to try all the seafood u want . restaurant offers you large seating area to enjoy your meals . freshest seafood ever. Try their mix seafood bag.one of the easiest way of having all the seafood in one . great customer service with quick response. Value for money.
5
The sauces are to die for. A simple dish of live steam prawn accompanied by the black sauce canâ€™t be found anywhere in Singapore. The sotong you Tiao complimented by their special prawn paste sauce is extremely good. No one prepares chilli crab the way jumbo does. Even the baby squid is fantastic. Oh oh must go to jumbo agai
5
, Got a recommendation from our Taxi driver and glad we listened to him!We ordered the classic Crab in chili source and it was d e l i c i o u sDidn't make reservations in advance but registered as we arrive and got an SMS not after too long, since we were ok with sitting with other people on the same tabl
4
Have visited Jumbo on so many occasion and have always loved the setting of the tables near the cool ocean breeze, helpful servers and yummy crab .. although the crab is a must have also recommended are the prawns and the drool-worthy crab meat curry to lap up with the buns my toddler also enjoys going to this restaurant as the fried rice is not spicy and perfect for lil tummies
4
I am from Maryland, cracking and eating crabs occurs at least once or twice a summer. We jumped at the chance to try Chili Crab. The portions are huge -- one order of chili crab serves two. Since there were four of us, we ordered one chili crab and one salt and pepper crab. We have been told since, that we should have ordered the pepper crab, not the salt and pepper crab. We liked the salt and pepper crab so who knows... The crab body is just a little bigger than the famous Maryland blue crabs, but the claws are probably two or three times fatter. Lots of amazing claw meat! The dish is messy, but well worth it. We were seated at a communal table in one of the VIP rooms. The service was very attentive and it was fun to watch the others at our table struggle through cracking and picking the crabs. Please be aware that the prices are not cheap -- I am thinking an order of Chili crab was about $50 Singaporean
5
Jumbo seafood is one of my favorite chili crab place in Singapore. Nice seaside view. Friendly and helpful staffs.
4
Good service from Staff. Alaska crab on discount, but after discount still pricey. Each pax around $100+.
4
We have eaten here previously, ordering the 'more fancy' dishes, but this time, just some prawns for an early dinner, rather than fish and rather than crabs. It is a great place, as is the whole relaxing area in which it is located.
5
Nice experience. It was a first time for my guests from USA. The food was new but delicious to most of them.
4
This is the place to have the chilli crab. It is not expensive compared to other places and countries.Lots of sauce makes for ordering the bread buns baked or steamed are good for soaking. The greens were great as well.
4
jumbo carbs served here.. you have to be ready for such nice experience.. and dont forget to have the sharks fense soup .. they told us its great for empowering you
3
Service was mediocre, food was tasty. Portions did not match the prices. Felt like tourist prices. Better off at a good tze char stall at half the price.
2
Very disappointed with this place,we were recommended to try this restaurant but afterwaiting quiet a while to be seated even though we had booked,trying to get drinks took forever then when the food order finally came,it was spread out over about half an hour so ,some of us were well finished by the time the final dish of rice appeared.The food was well presented and tasted great but overall was put down with the lack of service.Try somewhere else next time
5
You havenâ€˜t tasted Singapore without having a chili crab. It is the signature dish of the island. The version here is nice and juicy, not to spicy and the usual mess while you eat a decent sized crab. Nice location at the seafront with alfresco seating available. Service was good and fast
4
Excellent prepared seafood at a nice East Coast beach location, fast but sometimes not so efficient service, good solid pricing, no surprises there at all, extremely busy from Fridays onwards, best to make a reservation if in a group of four plus, aircon and open air dining choices, absolute must for visitors. Chili crab here we come !!!!There are several branches, the East Coast is the most popular.There have been reviews in which the food was classed as mediocre, however have never had a bad meal there, in weekends it has waiting time for some popular dishes
4
We had a sumptuous dinner here with visiting relatives last evening. Loved all of the dishes... deep fried baby sotong (squid), friend youtiao (油条, dough fritters) with squid paste, drunken prawns, chili crabs! All good and must be tried!
5
But a little dirty. It was quite crowded on a Saturday. Crab was a little small, although flavour and quality were good.
4
Delicious delicacy served along the seaside. Signature dish like the chilly crab, black pepper crab, deep fried sea bass, tofu... the list goes on. A not to be missed famous Singapore seafood restaurant. Not to be missed for any tourist. A great way to dine.
1
We stayed yesterday at jumbo , 4 people. Went several time to jumbo but this time it was really bad. 2 dish we could not even eat as they were so bad. We complained (few time) to the waiter that said absolutely nothing..... they seems not even trained to handle such issues....Crab was ok.The place is also huge and looks more like a factory than a restaurant. Frankly for food and service go somewhere else .... from now on this is what I will do
4
I like this outlet. They provide big round table up to 16, plenty of seatings and it's located in side of East Coast. You can have a good walk after meal. Food is same as the rest of the outlet, average and a bit pricey on the crabs ( same to all the seafood restaurants). Service is always nice, I like the staff here.
5
Can’t get fresher than crabs served at this restaurant. Ordered chili crab and crab w salted egg yolk sauce. Both tasted great, just different style. Took my 103 year old grandma to Singapore for vacation and she loves the crab at Jumbo.Make sure you book a table 2-3 days in advance.
1
We went there for the chilly crab as recommended and the food is good but the service's bad.the foods come almost 20 minutes in between and our rices arrived after we finished 70% of our food.The face of the waitress cool like an ice with no smile.When we finished paid and on the way out,we saw they have a Citi-bank card sign with 15% off and I ask ed the host can we re-pay by Citi-card and she rejected.Unpleasant diner trip
4
We always visit this restaurant for my family’s birthday celebrations. I even had my 3 year old birthday dinner here because it’s such a great place to eat, bond and make memories. The food is usually good and the service is always warm & helpful. What’s there not to like.
4
An old faithful choice when we have out of town guests as it never disappoints. Chili crabs and steamed prawns are always reliable - fresh, tasty. Other sides like sambal kangkong and mee goreng are good too. Prices are mid to high but you are assured of good quality and service.And if you’re fortunate enough to pick a cool and windy evening, eating alfresco with the sea breeze is just perfect
4
Although the location is no better than the one alone Singapore River, this restaurant still attracts so many ppl that often queueing is required. Crab is a must dish. the sauce is different from other places. You will like it once you try it, despite of high price. Anyway, you can also find some good ones in Clementi and Gaylang area with much lower price
5
Great chilli & black pepper crabs. Ms Pauline Lee exceed service expectation, making our dining experience memorable.
4
Friends gathering from English and Malaysia. Resturant environment was superb and had a wonderful evening dinner together.
5
We went to Jumbo only to have Chilli Crab based on recommendation... and I'm glad we went.. It was clear this is one of the favourite restaurant around when we saw the crowd... Nice ambience and great service apart from simply awesome food.. A must try dish here is Chilli Crab..
4
If we receive guests in Singapore or want to celebrate some achievement our family will often chose to go to one of the Jumbo Seafood outlets in Singapore. For some reason we like Dempsey Hill best. But they are all good and food tasts the same. The Chilli Crab is our absolute favourite - best enjoyed with some little buns to make sure you don't miss any of the accompanying gravy. Service and ambience is good too and prices are fair
5
Definitely go for the chilli and pepper crab. Try the sweet fried bun with the chilli crab. Nice view at clark quay. You do pay $10 a kilo more compared to Chinatown, but the view is worth the premium. Service was good. The staff are very atrentive and friendly. A must go
5
We booked from Australia before we went as this restaurant is highly regarded for its Crab and seafood dishes. We were not disappointed..... we shared 2 kilos of chilli crab and a side dish of bread type buns, wow it was all delicious and the service was excellent. The ambience of the restaurant was good as well. Would definitely recommend this place to lovers of seafoo
5
I Love crabs. I’ve had it with the sweet chili sauce, vinegar with shrimp paste, butter garlic sauces .. this one is also a must to try! Yumm Yumm Yumm. Also tried the tiny fried squid and that was SOooo good too. Glad I spent my birthday dinner there!
4
We went to this place because my husband lived in Singapore for some years and he loves this place. We ate pepper crabs and it was delicious- it is better than lobster. Try also the vegetables with garlic and/or soya sauce. These are fantastic. The atmosphere is not so romantic. If you book a table then book a table outside in the first row
4
The famous seafood restaurant in Singapore is here. This is the second time for my third visit in Singapore. Nice atmosphere of Clarke Quay from Jumbo seafood. Only fix 1.30 hours to have dinner. At this time visit, they’re clouded. Staff come to take order late 10 minutes, the food serve a little bit late 20 minutes so we have time to dine about 1 hour. We ordered 2 recommend dishes of Jumbo crabs and 1 dish of fresh steamed fish, always delicious and fresh.
5
We were taken to Jumbo by some local collegues, who siad this is one of the best casual sea food restaurants. From the outside it looks like every other brash, neon lit local places that seem to be on every street corner. However, the uninspiring exterior holds a wonderful food experiance. Luckily having local friends, who have been here many times before, we did not have to navigate the menu but let them choose for us. So glab they did, becuse dish after dish of wonderful food turned up at our table. Be prepared to get your hand dirty, becuse there is no other way to get stuck in. This is not for the faint hearted but the rewards are well worth effort. We had too type of crab - pepper and chilli - both were out-standing, lovely sweet, succulent crab meat with a lovely touch of spice and heat. I have to say the rest of the meal was a bit of a blur becuase the focus on getting every littel bit of meat out of the shell became a point of honour. The fact that we sat, laughed at each others efforts whilst slugging beer just added to the fun. Highly recommened for a group becuse be warned you get a lot of crab. Looking forward to returning for a second round of crab claw wrestling
5
All step is very kindly and allways smile.
view also very nice, next time i represent there.
thank you for your service.
4
We really enjoyed dining at this branch as it’s breezy next to the sea. Food is fresh as well.
The lunch crowd is manageable and the staff are very attentive.
5
Staff are very attentive to our need. They remember us even we dine on quarterly basis. My cousin will visit them when they are back from Hongkong
4
Large group of friends came here, no booking, but that wasn't a problem. We had a share banquet. The chili crab was fantastic and the prawns. The staff really looked after us
4
Good food. On e pricey side. Love the mee goreng, bamboo clam, Chilli crab etc. Nice view of the sea - perfect for the your white guests
4
Service was almost impeccable. The staff managing our table was very proactive in chasing the kitchen for our food which really was quite impressive for us as we don't usually get such initiative and positive attitude from f&b establishments in singapore. The chilli crab is award-winning for a reason, and you definitely should come find out why.
5
My first attempt eating a fresh Alaska Crab in Jumbo was breathtaking. It was so fresh and sweet. We had it done in black pepper and chili. It was so fresh that steaming it would be as ideal. Despite having to wait 45min for the dish, it was certainly worth the wait
4
The chili crab is great no doubt about it. But be aware that everything they offer you, EVERYTHING, will have a price. No need for more than one small crab for too people and, again, ask the price because it is not published. And make a reservation because there was theater style seating outside for the wait
4
The curry crab here is famous, and deservedly so. Crab demands significant investment of effort for limited return by volume, but in this case the return by flavour well justifies the investment. Other dishes were also really good. The atmosphere is very informal - like a giant chaotic canteen, and the service patchy
5
The original outlet used to be located along the eastern coast of singapore, there are many outlets now but all outlets are patronise mainly for one reason! Chilli Crab! One of the best best best dish to have especially with a large group of friends and family where you dig into the dish with with your hands picking up Sri Lankan crabs (2kg and above! Big) Coated with sweet spicy gravy or dip into it with fried bread! Of cos, other signature will be fresh steam fishes, clams stir fried with bean paste and chilli and many many more! There are many seafood restaurants in Singapore but Jumbo is one that somewhat has maintain the level of taste but service standards may varies from good to mediocre!
3
I booked early on website linked to chope for vip guests but seating was really bad. We came a bit early but table booked was not given.
4
Good food and good service by staft Pauline Lee , good advice and good recommendation by her, very kind and helpful person !!!
4
Very busy with great chilli crab to die for. Service was quick and fast and turnover for tables fast so the wait is not too long.
4
Food was good but the service was quite slow. I guess this is because the restaurant was full and they are short handed. Overall the dining experience was good.
5
Chilli crab
Black pepper crab
Cereal prawn
These three dishes are a must and you won't regret. It's totally worth in every bites.
4
Ordered one black pepper crab one Chilli crab . Both were very spicy for my family and I. Crabs were damn huge. Somehow the best dish we had was the sambal Kang kong(lol).
5
Fantastic Seafood restaurant where they keep the fish in fishtanks and you can choose the fish by your self so it's really fresh. I can really recommend this restaurant. Very exclusive a lot of different fishes and crabs.
5
6 of us went there, ordered 2 crab one in chillie one in black pepper prawn
all are good and very tasty
5
Wide range of sea food at high quality, the signature dishes the chili or pepper crab amazing is my 8th visit to this restaurant and the service and quality food still the same, don't miss this opportunity to enjoy great food
1
The kindest thing to do in this case is to rescue the seafood from the tanks and give it to other restaurants. The chefs here shouldn't be trusted with the poor animals. A lobster we had was inexplicably cut into chunks with the shell still on, sending shards of shell deep into the meat. Staff have no issue with leaning on to you to reach food across the table. Also rude. Also unclean. I feel abused and all the poorer for it.
5
Although $$$$, which we knew going into the establishment the Pepper/Chili Crab touched flavor notes that haven't been touched in awhile. Come ready to eat and with your pocket book! Highly Recommend.
4
Great food and service. Chili crab, black pepper crab and bamboo clams are highly recommended. The clarke quay branch has very good dining ambiance as it's next to the river.
5
The food here was great. I have a child with a nut allergy and the staff were so good and really looked after us, especially Yvonne. Busy place...
5
Best chili crab in Singapore hands down the taste was amazing. And the salt egg prawns for a starter delicious.
1
Too much expensive compared to its taste, service and cleanliness
I will never visit this restaurant again.
5
It might seem cliche to go to Jumbo and eat Chilli Crab whilst in Singapore, but it’s totally worth it. Seriously the best crab we’ve ever eaten, and that chilli sauce is divine. The experience is interesting, it’s slightly pricey (eg:$24 for plate of Gai larn) service average but good enough given how busy the are. This is a must do experience whilst in Sing.
4
We tried the Chili crab and salted egg Crab. Love the Chili crab! But we sat 2nd level. There is a seating section whereby food were pushed out and dirty dishes were pushed in. I think they should do an auto door or put something to close the view. Where the few tables seated there would see the dirty view of the inside section is putting off while we were eating.
5
Our host in Singapore selected this restaurant so we let him do all the ordering. He ordered way too much and in our experience the items ranged from OK to exquisite.The most amazing dishes were the Black Pepper Crab, the stir fried baby Kai Lan greens with garlic and the dessert: Chilled mango Sago with Pomelo.(There is almost too much on offer and it would be hard for a newcomer to pick out the outstanding dishes -- for example, we had some crispy chicken and some king prawns that were not particularly impressive.
3
Jumbo seafood is one of the many seafood restaurants in singapore but this one has many branches around. Famous one for tourists will be at clarke quay and east coast area. I have tried the one at east coast couple times and the standard is consistent. Great with family with kids so everyone can take a stroll after dinner and kids can play with sands or even just a walk in the evening. Food wise, the chili crab with mantou is a must-try. While others like lobster and fish are also fresh and good where you can even handpick them alive from the aquarium
4
We went for the set menu for 6. Selected a huge Alaskan crab. It was prepared half singapore chilli style and the other half in pepper crab style. Bamboo clams, prawn,tofu and lots of other stuff ending with mild sweet fruit jelly. Would recommend for seafood lovers.
4
great food great service great place to chill with my oversea friends and she love the pepper crab lots .lots
5
I've never really like pepper crabs, preferred chili crabs, However, the pepper crabs here really blew me away! Service is excellent - very fast, professional and friendly. Went on a weekday (Wed) and was surprised it was almost full-house.
3
took 15 min to be seated WITH a reservation. food was good though.
Not sure if its worth the trouble if staying in the city
4
What a good experience we had, very fresh, very quick. The Cod was our favourite dish but the crispy skin chicken was a great one for the kids
4
My guest and family visit jumbo several time.
As always we took a chili and a black pepper crab.
Good food, Good Crabs and consistent taste with quality. Slightly on the high price.
But it still worth the amount spend.
5
Jumbo Seafood is best known for its secret recipe for chili crab. We usually celebrate every birthday in our family there.Needless to say, we always order their chili crab without fail (2 of them for a family of 4). The sauce that its cooked in is lip-smackingly good. We order at least 2 dozen steam buns to eat the sauce in. We also like their baby kai lan cooked in garlic (large portion).Everything is washed down with Tiger beer.Bon apetit
2
Visited Jumbo Seafood this week after a long time away. We were firstly shocked by the degeneration of the once famous and iconic East Coast Seafood Centre. Of the known restaurants only Long Beach and Jumbo are left. We were also disappointed by the new restaurant which played loud music and it's restaurant which affected the ambience if the whole place. The place is no longer what it used to be.Anyway we chose Jumbo Seafood to have dinner. We order the must have chilli crab. Also the scallops and othe vegetable side dishes. The crab dish is still good but really expensive. What disappointed us is the scallop dish which has only 6 small scallops and of varying sizes. Compared to Chuk Yung of Hong Kong the seafood here is well below expectations. The service at the restaurant is also now run of the mill.If you are in Singapore, East Coast Seafood Centre is no longer the best place for seafood. It has deteriorated so much. Not recommended
4
We ordered king crab (half for pepper and half steamed with egg yolk), prawn cooked with salted egg, steam "soon hock" fish. All were good tasted dishes and the food were very fresh. Worth trying and highly recommended.We walked in at 7:30 without booking. The waiting time was only 25 mins though all tables were occupied. One minor comment: there were no enough staffs during the peak hours though they approached us quickly when we decided our choice of food from the menu. Until 10:30, about 50% people left, the situation got better.
5
Amazing food, if you like seafood. Perfectly placed with soft music playing is a spicy yet full of flavor crab. Everything in this restaurant has flavors which compliment each other in the perfect way. You'll enjoy it for sure if you have the taste for high quality food
5
Jumbo Seafood is my all time favorite restaurant especially coming with overseas guest. Could not miss their signature dish - Chili Crab, not forgetting also the crispy fried baby squid, local cuisine - satay. We also tried fried scallion with yam ring and it's amazingly good too. Nothing to complaint about the food and this is definitely worth the visit. East Coast branch is exceptionally awesome as it's located at the seaside, and you could feel the breeze from the sea, and have a slow walk also after the dinner (good for digestion ) Last but not least, pls remember to make advance reservation to avoid long waiting time. Enjoy!
5
it was a great experience that I can lovely food with my friends and family , I love them soooooo much!
4
Enjoy seafood dinner there with family. Prawns is fresh and good. There is discount under Groupon at NSTRCC Jumbo. But the distance could be a bit out for those not staying in the east and without transport. Can take the shuttle from Tanah Merah MRT
4
bring the order one very slow. very hard to order as the staff is not around,
Last order of fried rice was cancelled cause it takes another 10 minutes
3
To visit Jumbo Seafood is a must in Singapore but don't expect a fantastic dinner. It is overpriced and sloppy.
5
Had not been here for 5 years so wanted to try it again. It was even better than I had remembered. Messier, too, but delicious. Great service with plenty of napkins, a finger bowl, bib and plastic bag for cellphone. Not inexpensive, but nothing is cheap in Singapor
4
Met up with a couple of locals who took me to Jumbo to experience Singapores famous Chilli Crab, assuring me that it's the best place in Singapore for it. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and was a very pleasant evening. The Chilli Crab was totally amazing and I can see why the locals rave about it. Make sure you're hungry when you visit, because it definitely deserves its reputation for great food!
4
Ordered their signature chilli crab and the crab was fresh and huge. However, sauce a bit tasteless this time. Must order the fried mantou to dip at the crab sauce. It is damn good! Also ordered broccoli with scallop, HK style tilapia fish, sweet & sour pork and HK style fried mee which was good. Definitely have to return but damage it expected
4
Jumbo Seafood has a number of locations, from seaside venue at East Coast Parkway to rustic charm at Dempsey Hill to city vibe at Clarke Quay by the Singapore River. Whatever your preference for the ambience, the food quality is pretty much uniform. Menu prices are quite similar across their chain but the price is between mid-range to high. It may be worthwhile to pay a few bucks more but the quality and taste is pretty much assured. The black pepper crabs or chili crabs are the did die must try dishes. Other favorites would be the usual seafood fare, dependent on budget, simple prawns or live fish dishes to the more extravagant lobster or geoduck offerings. My personal preference, go to Parkway Parade, nothing like having seafood by the sea. You can take nice stroll along the beach before or after dinner and possibly walk to the nearby East Coast Lagoon hawker centre for a taste of local fares if you are still hungry or to sit under the stars to chill. Expect crowds at night especially over the weekends so go early or make reservations online
4
It's the first time that my Taiwan customers try the Chili crab in Singapore. Initially, they were quite sceptical on the spicyness of it as a few of them are Chili intolerant. Once they tasted it, it's an unforgettable experience and kept showing a big thumbs up while taking photos with the group. If you give this a miss, you will leave Singapore with some regrets
3
East coast park is announced as attraction in many tour guides - in fact the taxi ride out there costs already, one is landing in an outside part of the shore, container ships out on the water, wood lands and basically 2 blocks of touristic restaurant with menues - mainly without prices - and waiters outside who want to pull you in. Under these circumstances Jumbo looked the best to us since also many locals choosed this. The food was good, not exceptional but OK, prices are luxury - we do not recommend to go to east coast at all
5
This place never failed to impressed us with high quality seafood and services. Always packed and required reservation prior to your meal but it was all worth the hassle.
5
This is a well known restaurant and offers lovely Chinese seafood . If you have no expereince of this type of restaurant ,go with someone who knows what to order. Excellent chilli crab and pepper crab, gae lan, and soya bean dishes ,
5
Excellent seafood choice. Very busy restaurant. You may have to queue at peak times. Seating is overlooking the river and at night the colourful lights of Clarke Quay
5
Went with a large group for an authentic Singapore meal. Everything was excellent. Chili Crab was superb. Fried Tofu was very good as well.
4
We had a great dinner there. The food was very very nice as always. But the service need to be improved.
1
Looking for a late evening meal on a long layover in Singapore. Hours posted are until midnight. Arrived at 11:10 after a $25 uber ride. I was told they had taken their last order and was refused service, even though there were at least 30 customers still eating. I own a restaurant and this is one of my pet peeves. We serve until 10 minutes after the posted closing time. If you want to close at 11 just post an 11 closing time.
3
We ordered the ever-so popular 1KG of chili crab and a small order of noodles (its pictured in the menu). It filled us up. Food: Crab was fantastic. 10/10 would recommend. Noodles were good and spicy. Everything else: service was trash. They don't refill your tea or help you after you've ordered. You're charged for everything - the tea THEY offer and the nuts THEY offer.For just the crab and noodles and 2 bottles of water, we spent roughly $85. Ouch. I'm sure you could get this crab elsewhere tb
5
Wow I expected a lot and got even more! With the hype, I must admit expecting disappointment. But not one but Service was friendly and intuitive. Sitting outdoors by the bay was peaceful and atmospheric and definitely the way to go on a lovely, balmy Singapore evening. Overall, the food was great. Had the chili and Black pepper crabs and both were wonderful..... And messy!! That chili sauce was incredible. Not too spicy, just enough to tingle without being overbearing. Loved it so much we bought the kit to take home. The bread/dumpling things were great to dip and I'm not sure whether fried or steamed is better. But just make sure to order heaps. Frogs Legs with onion and Oyster Sauce were lovely. Seafood fried Rice was a hit but don't waste that spare stomach space on Rice! We ordered salt n pepper prawns but think we got garlic instead, however they were so good we said nothing and just enjoyed it. Now a tip. If you're going to slurp up that chili sauce, take some tissues! Overall a great experience with price as expected and not cheap but worthwhile and I can't wait to go back

Yes price is on the high side (there are cheaper seafood restaurants in Singapore) but you will not go wrong bringing your guests (especially overseas guests) to Jumbo outlets. Their chilli crabs with the mantou are good. Other dishes like fried rice, kangkong, etc are equally gd as well.However, it could be crowded and with higher labour cost here, you might not get the service level require

Famous for the chili crab the place was packed which is always a good sign. We ordered the peppered Alaskan crab because I had tried the chili crab a few years ago. For a 1/2 order (which was enough for 2 people) the waiter said the prices was $250 SGD! However it was on special for 50% off and he went on to show me on some weird iPhone app the discount. Regardless of the 'special' $150 for a 1/2 crab in Singapore is still a rip off. I was told you can get similar options at less touristy places for $50! Anyway it was delicious as was the sides and location on the water with a nice breeze was great.
4
Nice environment. Would recomend to dine early like 6pm, when its still bright enough to enjoy the scenery. Food price is a bit on the high side.
5
This is a very nice restaurant to visit after work if you are working in the vicinity. The seafood is fresh and the waiting is not too long. Highly recommended if you are a seafood lover!
4
We were given a table close to the sea, it was breezy and cool. The food was delicious and my visiting friends enjoyed it immensely.
4
The atmosphere is good but of course as usual , Singapore is rather humid. The food is great especially Chili crabs, a definitely must eat.
5
Service is excellent and attentive. Mocha pork ribs is very nice. We had chilli crab and the dish was so good with fried mantous. Crab is very fresh too.
4
Chili Crab is very famous at Jumbo. It's an one best place to eat it in Singapore and very popular for foreigners. Good ambience. Recommend it.
3
Totally nice food and big portion but the only thing that missing is the service...
Chilli crab was best of them all..
4
One of the most iconic Singaporean dishes would be chilli crab and here's where jumbo shines. For tourists who are afraid of trying the dish because of the word chilli, don't worry - its more than than spicy. Remember to get some mantou or fried buns to go along! Mamamia

I took six work colleagues. After having Chili Crab earlier in the week at Quayside, I was convinced they had the best chili crab in S'pore. I've been coming to S'pore for work for 15 years and taking people to Quayside for dinner and always ordering the chili crab. I stand corrected. I should have been going to Jumbo (if only for the food). We had venison, stir fried Chinese greens with garlic, scallops wrapped in taro, seafood rice, and of course, chili and black pepper crab. Everything was great. While very busy, service was prompt. And no, this isn't just a place for Ang Mo's. If you've every been to a seafood restaurant in China (or Hong Kong), this has the same feel. Loud, fast paced, and entertaining. Expensive, but worth it
4
Jumbo appears to be a large factory, but this is really only because they r so efficient in moving the crowds, especially in comparison with the other seafood joints. food quality Has remained good over the years, and the price remains reasonable. Still the best chili crabs in singapore and I still love my favorite mee goreng. If only crabs aren't so bad for my cholesterol.... I would love to come back every other week!!
5
Been to Clark Quay and visited this restaurant for a signature Singaporean chili crab. Amazing taste. Great service and very friendly staff. The shrimps sizes were also so big and professionally done. Will definetly be back if another visit is made.
5
Tasting Singapore's national dish- The Chili Crab, couldnt have been better. Loved the overall experience, the slightly spicy crab was perfectly accompanied by sweet buns. The service was good, the price is a little on the higher side but was totally worth it.
5
A 1.1 kg Chilli King Crab cost S$100, but it is definitely worth it! Our standard orders are drunken prawn, steamed fish (market price), bamboo clam S$16 per piece, and whatever in season...our top choice in the last 3 decades, consistently great!
3
Their signature dish of Chilli Crab was good, but tended to be over-rated relative to pricing and the hype around it. Other dishes are ordinary.
4
I've been to Singapore a number of times but never fortunate to have Chilli Crab at Jumbos. One of our business partners treated us to not only Chilli Crab but also the Black Pepper Crab and both were awesome....highly recommended.
3
Exceptional service and food . Good venue for business dinner and with family over the weekend.
Great!
4
The service was excellent. It took about 30 mins for the crab to come, but it was worth the waiting.

Jumbo's is billed as the 'go to' location for Chili Crab and my wife happens to be something of a "consumption expert" on the topic. The place is right off the RiverWalk so if you are not local, make your way to the NE line, station 5 which is named Clark Quay. Once you navigate the maze to get out of the subway you will hopefully be facing s street Eu Tong Sen. If you look across the street and a bit to the left you will see Song Fa (which serves really good Bak Kut Teh if Crab isn't your thing...but thats a different review). Behind you in the mall you just left will be a Chilis.. which is not where you want to go.Cross the street towards Song Fa and then continue that direction. Before the river swing right and you will see the place. You can do a reservation although if you get there you can also queue to the left and self-register with your phone number and it will call you. The process is very straight forward.Once you are sat they give you about 1.5 hours to do your damage. As stated before, the Chili Crab is the thing to get here. 101A is the sweet chili sauce with egg. 101B is the Black Pepper. Both are good.. we didn't try the 101C or 101D. I also tried the Scallops fried in XO sauce and found it overly greasy and not particularly worth the price. My recommendation (as there are far better places for seafood all over Singapore) is to stick with the crab which is really good it will set you back around $70 Singapore or $45 US per. The peanuts they give to you are also pretty good to snack on and tea refills will go as long as you can get their attention.Service is mediocre to OK. Our waiter wasn't particularly attentive but when asked he would deliver items. The other gals in yellow smocks were gloomy, forgetful, and almost required a pelting of dirty dishes and chopsticks to get their attention along with follow up reminders. In fact, I would recommend avoiding anything other than a singular request to the Yellow-smock gals.Overall, my wife was head down and a flurry of chopsticks and chainsaw sounds only pausing enough to give me a thumbs up and a happy grin with chili goo amply smeared across her chin. There were no complaints on the crab whatsoever and I was allowed to assist with a leg. The variety of crab is a little sweeter and mild compared to the species found in the US... so its worth trying. You can also get Alaskan and other types all over if you just want to eat crab the whole time you are here.After eating, you can easily take a stroll back down the riverwalk towards the Sands and there are plenty of bars and other eateries you can pop into for a nightcap, sweets or any number of other options.Food wise - stick to the crab or items like bread to soak up the sauce. I found the other menu items we tried to be marginal and better options exist. The crab is very good but the service can be a little challenging

Jumbos had a fun atmosphere by the water, staff were attentive and helpful! Our orders were taken fast, our glasses always full!The famous must-have Singapore chilli crab was fantastic, and so was the deep fried whole fish! Everything else we ordered was fairly average. The crispy squid tasted floury and unflavoured, the satay chicken tasted poor quality with texture that felt over processed.Overall still an experience I would recommend :
4
Went to Singapore to visit my sister and her husband and they said we had to try the chilli crab. I am not a big fan of crab but tried some anyways and it tasted amazing! Slightly too spicy for me but I cannot handle my spice hah
5
Was here this evening. Love the view from the top. Cooling, calm & peaceful to chill the nite with close friends. View at night is stunning. There's a dance area for one to dance if you like to boggie the nite. Will come back again.
5
We went there abt half hr late but since is a weekday so the reservation still there. Just wonder if on a weekend will the seat still available ?
5
We went to celebrate a birthday and the service was above average. The food however was excellent despite it being a full house.
5
Absolutely brilliant. Chili crab and black pepper crabs are a must. Such an amasing food experience, just godious.
5
There are several Jumbo Seafood restaurants in Singapore and they are all good. Treat yourself to the Chilli Crab and ensure little sweet buns to mop up the crab sauce ... yum 👍
3
We returned to Singapore but just for 7-8 hours because we had a long layover when returning home from our holiday destination Borneo. We made a reservation in advance because during the evenings the restaurant is full so don't come here if you don't have a reservation. We came here specially for the chili crab which was delicious but expensive and difficult to eat. You can add rice to your chili crab because it tastes better with a side dish. As a first timer eating chili crab things are not so easy. You need to brake the crab claws but this is part of the experience. Use an apron because things might get messy.We took also prawns but the taste was average I don't recommend them. Beer was good by the way :) And crab also..
5
Man, what a treat!!! This place is extremely popular so don't go without a booking if it's anytime around 6 to 8pm. We had chilly and black Pepper crabs. Some said they preferred the Chilly Crab and others said they preferred the Black Pepper Crab. For me, I preferred the Black Pepper Crab. Was out of this world. What a feast and a must do if you're in Singapore!! But be prepared, you will end up ordering extra plates of food because the crab may be huge, but the meaty bits are in the claws and the rest is minimal for "meat
1
- Food tasted terribly average- Way over priced and they pile on sneaky charges (they charge you for peanuts that are readily placed on your table before you get there and tea...we never ordered tea or weren't asked if we wanted any but were charged for it)- Service mostly bad. The servers are disinterested and grumpy, and show their disdain if you ask for anything....like paper napkins which were never given to you in the first place.- We had a dead bug on one of our plates and when we showed the lady, she gave us back a wet plate and a second lady wiped the bug with her finger and put the plate back on the "clean dishes" pile, ready to be sent out to someone....wish we ran out at that momentSkip this awful place and save yourself the disappointment
3
Food started coming barely two minutes after we placed our orders and was cold. Although the food quality wasn't bad, the food came fast and furious and we felt rushed although the restaurant was half empty. Service was poor and we had to request for multiple plate changes, water to be filled etc. Jumbo has to start paying attention to customer service before they lose their customers
3
The chili crab served is not hot, is warm . Not sure how long the dish is left there before is serve to our table. The table allocated is small, they did not offer us a bigger table even after knowing that we have order lots of food and even after I requested for a bigger table. "There are few big table available 
4
If you like seafood at a good price this is the place to go, It is not cheap but not expensive also. Their standard is good and consistent so you won't be disappointed and do not have to pay a bomb.
2
Better to go to some other zu cha (eg Outram road) which cost much less and tastier. Not worth a single penny. Lack of ambience, requires reservations and food served is not hot and probably cooked in big batches.
4
If you love seafood, this is the restaurant worth paying a visit. One of the dish that is not to be missed is the most popular chilli crab.
5
Food was served promptly, dish after dish (which is what we like). Staff respond quickly and are efficient. Not bad for a busy Saturday night! Evening was made perfect by the winds from the sea
5
Jumbo Restaurant, by far, has the best chili crab in town! This is the place we bring our friends visiting if they want to have a taste of the authentic chili crab experience. Anything on their menu is definitely worth a try!
5
The Jumbo East Coast is the best choice for dinner. Suggest to go early as crowds will be around at 7 p.m. and you will have to queue up for some time.The Alaskan Long Leg Crabs are the best in quality, while the chef is so good in making 2 dishes of different taste. I have tried the "pepper crab" and the "Crab steam with egg white"; both are delicious
4
Our first time overseas guests have enjoyed the food. They liked the chilli crab, sweet and sour prawns and the fried rice. Being repeated customers ourselves, we have enjoyed the food as we did the first time. Hope maybe Jumbo could bring down their price for the crabs as they are quite pricey.
5
Turned up on spec and was advised 90 min wait for a table or could eat immediately if we were prepared to sit on large table (10/12). We were a party of 4 and went for it, turned out to be a great decision.Food excellent, we tried the set menu and ate things we wouldn't have normally ordered as a result (jelly fish for example). Lady on our table kindly gave some advice on mixing pepper and vinegar in to soup which really changed and improved the flavour.Prices a little high, especially for beer but that is the same Singapore wide
4
Jumbo seafood at East Coast arguably has the best location of the company's many restaurants. The staff are attentive and able to offer good advice on the menu. We usually go for lunch on weekends, since the dinner crowd is too much. While many of the items are great, actually, the chili crab is only so-so, because they cook in bulk, and the gravy is commercialised. I feel the pepper crab is much better, but probably because it is less popular, and so, likely to be cooked individually upon order
5
I have been to this restaurant twice and each time I have been there we always ordered Mud Crab (chilly and black pepper). Variety of seafood & Chinese foods available. Outdoor/indoor tables are available. Great location and atmosphere. Nice restaurant but best is to book your table as this restaurant is very busy.Highly recommended when you are in Singapore to visit this restaurant
5
Excellant place for Crabs lovers- plenty of devious dishes to choose from - we only had the stomach for two of their many selections. Book and get there early- before 6pm as its packed by 7pm.
4
Chilli was good and delicious..
Sea side ambience is beautiful too.. A nice walk to end the dinner :)
Overall, nice place!
5
Nothing beats Jumbo Delicious sweet chilli crab And seafood dishes, excellent service, wonderful dining experience.
5
Chope is simple to use and I will continue to use it for future dining experience. I do not need to wait in queue for too long to get a table. Good experience.
5
Wonderful meal in a great location. We were well looked after, particularly when we mentioned a nut allergy issue.
5
simply the best chilli crab perfect with great ambience overlooking the east coast park. we ordered 2 carbs. one black pepper and another one, the famous chilli crab with fried bun! the cereal prawn is one of my fave too.
4
Food has always been good except that service is not always available. This restaurant is always busy.
1
I have not been back to jumbo seafood for a long long time until last weekend. The place were jam packed. So I thought the service and food should be good.We were assigned to out table pretty quickly but after that, the service just went down the drain. I had to make my 5th request before my belachan chili is being served. I had to many 3 request for a cup of ice and eventually I went to the beverage counter. And this I get a reluctant look of providing me with a cup of ice! The so known famous chili crab was below my expectation, I hv tasted much better ones elsewhere! Overall food, blah
4
It was as usual, live up to expectations of what you normally expect from a public listed company. It was crowded and bustling so don't expect a romantic and quiet evening. The food was great but not cheap and if you are looking at value for money, go to other places. It is for the occasional indulge when you are feeling generous
3
The time difference between the first dish and the second dish being served was a good 45 minutes! Way too long a wait! The reason given by the captain was that it was a busy night! Best to avoid going on Saturday evenings or u risk waiting for a long time to have your orders taken, and another long wait for the food to be served.
5
My family and I went here for cerebrating my birthday. We all love the food here. Service was great! can't wait for the next visit!
5
Great restaurant for seafood and local dishes as well as sashimi geoduck and lobster . Mee goreng , fresh coconuts drinks, and chilii crabs and black pepper crabs are excellent
5
Al fresco dining - chili crab and wine. the best way to spend a free evening with friends. Make your plans now!!
5
Visited Singapore and the taxi driver suggested we go to Jumbo Seafood for "best chilli crab in Singapore". We went on 22 Aug 2017 and were treated to great food, great atmosphere by the sea and awesome crowd.
4
Came for the Chilli Crab. Must try the yam and scallop thingy. The Black Pepper Crab wasn't a hit with our table. Delicious. Was too hungry to take any pictures. We were seated upstairs. Serviced was meh, but the food made up for it.
4
Overall a very good experience despite the price. It's a must for new tourists in Singapore! Don't miss out on it.
5
good view，good taste，good service，good experience。take many pictures there，feel very valuable。see you next time，jumbo。
4
My family and I come here regularly for our family dinner/lunch. We totally love the chilli crab and the black pepper crab. Do not order rice, instead order the fried or steam mantou to dip with your chilli crab sauce. Highly recommend booking before going because the place can be packed especially during the weekends.The 2 branches we love to visit are the one at East Coast (great for evening dinner in the open space with the seaview) Riverside at 30 Merchant (great for lunch) where we always go for indoor dining to beat the heat
3
This was our last night in Singapore and we had to try one of the chili crab restaurants. The restaurant is located on top of a hill next to a string of restaurants. Very nice vibe and make sure you have a reservation. We ordered one chili crab and one seafood fried rice. Also ordered a beer. The chili crab was a little too sweet and not spicy enough. The crab shell is hard and nothing special. The seafood fried rice was bland.Our bill for was $101 for two dishes and a beer! That's Singapore for you! Overall we will not come back to this restaurant and will not come back to Singapore for holiday. There are nicer Asian cities that offer more value (e.g. Saigon, Bangkok and KL)
5
A seafood dinner at the East Coast is one of our favorite activities when visiting Singapore. Last time we visited Jumbo Seafood at East Coast, nicely located at the sea side. Fantastic location for al-fresco dining. However take care to look at the weather forecast ! Reservation made via mobile through the Chope website worked great.Food : the menu has more than enough choices in our view. The pictures are very helpful if you are not familiar with the various dishes. Even while the restaurant was full, the various dishes as we ordered were served without having to wait, but also nicely one set after the other. Quality great as ever ! Fresh seafood, great taste !Prices are as to be expected for this type of restaurant and very worth while looking at the location, service and quality of food. For people who visit for the first time, be aware that fresh fish and crab is often sold by weight. If not aware, the bill can be a bit of a surprise
4
Came to try the famous Singaporean Chilli Crab and it was not bad. The other dishes I had tried was also quite good.
5
This place is massive with indoor and outdoor seating. It is by the ocean and with covered outside seating. Food was the n pricey side. Highly recommend chillie crab, cereal prawn and the buns
1
The rice came after all the dishes. The waiters and waitresses walked pass us like we are transparent.
4
While well-known for local specialties chili-crab and butter-crab, you can also get wonderful fish and vegetable dishes here. Don't limit yourself to crab alone!
4
This restaurant was recommended by friends back home, and it didn't disappoint at all. We had some kind of salad with duck meat, egg fried rice and venison, and everything tasted pretty good. We especially liked their donut with seafood paste. The service was prompt and efficient. The space between tables is negligible though. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves a lot, and are definitely going to visit again
4
Chilli crab is excellent, so are pepper crab and bamboo clams. Don't forget to take extra wet wipes with you. Restaurant never gives you enough and you inevitably end up with chilli sauce all over your hands. Sit outside in the evening if possible to enjoy the breeze and the ocean view
3
We can accept the fact that it is crowded but the service is horrible. They seems to be more eager in quickly clearing table for folks to sit down but when you ask for chilli, sauces,etc., they either take forever or they will conveniently forget. Only consolation is that the food is still pretty good
5
The importance of jumbo in our life is that we moved our flights from Kuala Lumpur by an hour and went to the restaurant on east coast park straight from the airport. The place was full and the prior reservation helped. We had our standard order of pepper crabs, crispy tilapia, cerealed prawns and seafood fried rice. The scallops we ordered weren't good at all. The service has improved a little. All in all, loved returning here :
2
I used to like Jumbo Seafood when it was a less hurried, service oriented must-go Singapore seafood experience.But since they listed the company on the local stock exchange, the owners appear to be trying to sell more, have quicker turnover of customers, raise prices and cut corners on the quality of their signature Sri Lankan crabs.I'd try the other seafood places ex
4
Overall itâ€™s good. Service is courteous and foods are served fast. We order chilli crab, black pepper crab, bamboo clams, drunken prawns, baby squids and sambal kangkong, with coconut juices and beers. Crabs are fresh and juicy, food is good. Ambience is great too - with dining by the seaside
4
Have to try the coffee pork ribs those are really good. Also the jelly fish. Chili crab was alright. It's good but not the best I guess.
5
Chilly crab in Jumbo Seafood is the best dish in Singapore. We like it very much. It is a must-east food every time when we visit Singapore.
5
Reservation is fast and smooth. Always our family's favourite to come to Jumbo East Coast Park for seafood. Food is good and service is fast.
4
Overall good. Service not bad, haven't encountered any bad experiences with service staff. Food is good, but price have gone up and portions have become smaller over the years. Good for family dinners or for celebrations.
4
If you like seafood you'll enjoy this restaurant !
For my taste all food is a little too sweet, but it's only my opinion.
5
You cannot miss it and especially if you like fish food here you could really enjoy
Crab is special but everything we tried and enjoyed
Service not in line with prices but depends who will be your waiter
3
The food was good and pricey. We booked and visited the restaurant before its crowd period. Not sure if it is worth queue up for this. We had Chili crab and it was small, and confirmed not Sri Lanka crab after we ordered. We over heard the waiter asked other table about the size of crab they want, but the same waiter didn't ask us. The manager informed us that it is just a mud crab and we could have had that way better in Thailand. The chili sauce is good but not that impressive. The fried buns and cereal shrimp were impressive for my opinion. The overall quality of food is good but again comes with the high price
5
Jumbo seafood is located near Clark Quay. It has 2 locations at Clark quay. They cater all kinds of sea foods and its quite expensive because it serves the finest. Good for the price. The locations is very nice and most of the time we need to que to get tables. Try chilli crab and anything that has salted egg on it the bes
3
We went here after having our uber driver recommend it. We went early as this is a popular restaurant, so popular that they give you a sitting of an hour which makes you feel quite rushed. We had the black pepper crab which was very tasty but considering there were 3 of us we were only given one nutcracker and crab fork. The service here is not very good. I don't think I would come back to be honest as there were so many other great places to eat with better service
3
We went for dinner for some seafood, which was decent but not extraordinary. For my taste the Chilli Crabs tasted too ketchupy (too sweet). On top, service could be improved e.g. staff not very attentive, kept on forgetting to bring some ice for the drinks and we felt rushed (in the door/out the door kind of thing). Needless to say, I did not feel the love.
4
A lovely setting, they've lifted their game with serving dishes since I was there 4-years back. Food is always reliably good. The host Jacky was fantastic!! Nothing was too much trouble for him.
4
I tasted typical Singapore food - a curry crab. The menu offers a number of other specialties. The staff was fast, tasty food. Inside the restaurant there is air conditioning, out there again a nice view of the river. Prices were slightly higher.
4
environment is the best among all jumbo branches, good place to bring business associates to eat. chili crabs are good as usual.
5
Food as usual at Jumbo is excellent.
Service was pretty good for such a packed evening.
Make sure you make your bookings.
5
Prefer going to this jumbo then the other branch. More spacious and friendly. I found it the food is better too.
5
It's impossible to put how delicious this meal was into words! Just spectacular! Don't miss out!
The crab in the chilli sauce was just out of this world! I don't honk I stopped to breathe as we devoured it!!
1
No idea how this place has manages these reviews.I guess price is ok, and dishes, other than crab were fine (tofu and vegetables).I love chilli crab and in all honestly this was the worst I have ever tasted. The crab itself was fresh, mantou buns delicious, but have to score on flavour of crab. I am pretty sure the sauce was tomato sauce, sugar and egg.We were brought here by singaporean friends who appeared very embarrased by the exoerience and ate almost none of the crab.Yuck!
3
The food was not bad, great crab. however, the service was really slow. i understand that it being a saturday evening, service is bound to be slower that usual. however, asking their staff 4 times for water was a bit excessive. there was a good view though as the restaurant is facing the sea. very windy as well, and planes taking off and landing could be seen.
4
Apart from the crispy squid that had to be returned as it was barely lukewarm, our meal was very good quality. The sauce on the squid is so yummy. Black pepper crab was so good we almost licked the plate. Sweet and sour fish was tasty, fish perfectly cooked.Soft drinks were expensive, eg sgd 5.80 for a lime juice. Total bill of sgd 200 for 3 of us with no alcohol felt steep but they fill the restaurant so maybe it isn't
5
No body can beat it in seafood,try the black pepper crab along with lobsters if you want Alaska crab then you have to ordered well in advance.They don't compromise in quality,the staffs are very friendly.The ambience is excellent and service is very good..Don't miss it if you are in Singapore,there are five branches,booking is must to avoid disappointment
5
The food is the best. The location at East Coast Seafood is the best. They never disappoint us. Being from Louisiana says a lot.
5
An evening at Jumbo seafood, great seafood; very expensive but worth it completely.
Amazing prawns and lobsters. Must experience the food once atleast
3
went with a friend who is from taiwan and she found the food not bad, tasty for the crabs and found it interesting to have the small crispy baby squid. the place was really packed for a weekday wed night. service was average.
5
As our local friend invited us, we could enjoy and appreciate dish tastes. Otherwise, we couldn't have enjoyed even 50%.
If u as a traveler want tasty seafood dishes and to have local food experiences, you should try out here!
5
I visited here on my first trip to Singapore for business. As well as loving Singapore overall, I really enjoyed sitting outside here near the canal and soaking up the atmosphere. We shared chilli crab, prawns and a few other fabulous dishes. The ice cold beer helped with the spice and was a good combination. I'm not sure of the cost as colleagues settled the bill but it's worthwhile for good food in a good setting. It's a busy place with fast service and delicious crab. The place to go for Singapore crab.
4
Tend to get dragged down here on business trips!! Starters are always great, the Chilli Crab can be a bit tedious without the surgeons tools!! The jugs of Tiger always make up for it when in a group and getting a table al fresco a must
4
The Jumbo at boat quay is always very busy and on a Tuesday night we were glad to take a walk in share table on a first sitting basis. As a long term chili crab-a-holic I ordered their signature premium 1kg "Worlds Best Chili Crab" Although the large crab legs and sauce were excellant be aware that the claws, my favourite part was from a much smaller crab. In fact one was laughable It was so small but to be fair I guess it made up the weight and some lucky diner must have got our missing jumbo sized claws. With an endless que of willing diners their response was unexpectedly pretty much mumbo jumbo
4
The place is always packed. We had the chance to have a front row table close to the sea. Very local. You are seated on plastic garden chairs. The food is simple but very fresh and good. If you are on a business trip this will give you an evening of vacation along the sea.
5
This restaurant is one of the most popular chili crab restaurants in Singapore. Their chili crab is tasty without being too pretentious. Ambience is casual and relaxed, food is excellent, service can be slightly improved. Their buns are amazingly delicious. Prices are a bit of the higher side
4
My wife and I are not fans of crab, but being in Singapore we wanted to try the fresh crab, and headed to Jumbo at East Coast Park. We walked in at 6:45 pm on a weekday and were immediately seated outdoors with a great view of the bay.Only some of the servers spoke English and after we were sent a nice lady who did, we ordered fresh catch black pepper crab, some prawns and drinks. The prawns were nice and came out quickly. The crab took 25 minutes but were mostly worth the wait. Breaking down the crab was a lot of effort for our untrained hands but we enjoyed it and the meat was sweet and delicious. We did the unthinkable and asked for forks, and after a lot of frantic searching they finally got us some.Billing was quick and while not easy on the pocket, we felt satisfied that the meal was worth the price.The two issues were how chaotic the floor got when it filled up with servers running everywhere and yelling to make themselves heard, and the smell of diesel fumes from the ships in the bay. Neither was really the restaurant's fault but it did detract from our overall experience.But still - highly recommended if you are in Singapore
4
This time, both the chilli and pepper crab were delicious, much better than 6 months ago. The hashima dessert had generous servings of hashima and very good value @ $7.80. Hope they keep this up!
5
One of the most popular chili crab restaurants in Singapore. Located out on the East Coast Parkway it's a favorite of locals and tourists. Really excellent chili crab and pepper crab along with a wide range of other Chinese dishes.

Ambience is casual and relaxed, food is excellent, local taste, may be spicy for foreigners. Price is reasonable. Always happy after a meal at Jumbo
5
It's a must go place if you are a crab lover like I do. Their chili crab is tasty without being too overpowering. It has just enough kick and yet enjoyable. Their black pepper crab is the best one I have ever tasted. Again they came up with a way to make it less open powering. Overall fantastic dinner, great and unique location. We will be back

Saturday night in one of Singapore's most famous restaurants and it was cockers. We had booked and got an excellent table. Found the service to be some of the worst we have encountered in Singapore. To the extent one of the table got up and went and collected a waitress to take our order rather than waiting for them to come. The chilli crab was excellent, the crispy baby squid were over cooked and the drunken prawns were nothing special at all. We ordered more beers and yet again they took an age to come. I just have a feeling that this restaurant is living on past greatness and is losing its shine
5
Always have a seafood meal at this restaurant while we are in Singapore with the most important dish being Singapore soft shell chili crab. This was excellent as always and comes with a plentiful quantity of sauce and separated served nice buns (to soak up the sauce).On this occasion we were with Singaporean friends who suggested some very different dishes, such as scallops crumbed in yam, jellyfish with noodles (cold dish) as an entree. We very much enjoyed all the food were were served.The food was excellent and not particularly expensive for seafood in a restaurant located with great views of the nearby sea.Service was good and attentive without being intrusive and given in a friendly manner.Wine is expensive by Australian standards but not over the top for Singapore and Asia.We will be back here at this restaurant next year when we are traveling to and from Europe for a repeat particularly the chili crab
5
So-the Chili Crab is supposed to be "the item" to eat while in Singapore. This is the place to go. Jumbos had 2 locations. Either is good. But try the cereal prawns and the veggies too. Staff may not be completely fluent in English so don't get frustrated if you get the wrong drink or whatever--doesn't matter. It's all good. But make reservations early! You can eat inside or outside. Oh--and the little square rolls are the best. Dip them in the chili sauce.
5
Have been here many times and is still one of my favourite seafood restaurant. Both the chilli crab and the white pepper crab are one of my top dishes which I will not missed each time that I am here especially when I have a craving for crab. The drunken prawn offered good amount of sweet and tasty soup and the prawn is very fresh. The sambal kangkong has small dried prawn in the sambal that add to the taste. This is the place that I will bring my business associates for good seafood dinner when they want to eat the famous Singapore chilli crab
2
My friends and I decided to try Jumbo because we'd hard that it had typical food from Singapore and we couldn't miss it. The truth is that, even though I was lucky enough to order a good dish, my friends did not like theirs. The staff was clearly having a bad day because we couldn't get a single smile from the waitresses, and it's extremely expensive. If you are willing to spend a good amount of money I kind of recommend it, but otherwise, do not waist your time
5
I love chili crab from this restaurant and now in love with new dish called cereal prawn. Must try chili crab with Chinese bun (fried and steam) by dipping buns with the chili sauce. Food is quite expensive but if it can fulfill our expectations then why not try
4
Will normally visit Jumbo on special occasions... All the years, their crab dishes are still one of the best...
5
Amazing food, such a great experience. My son tried chilli crab and squid for the first time and really enjoyed it. The staff are extremely attentive and helpful.
5
If you love chilli crab then this is the place to visit when you are in Singapore! My father and I absolutely love this place. We literally stayed overnight in Singapore just so we could go for dinner! We will be back
3
Disappointed with chilli crab.
Not delicious as some people said.
The taste of fried rice is so so.
Sea food tofu is good.
Ponglee restaurant in Bangkok is better.
4
Jumbo has been around for a while but I find that it can sustain its high food quality every time I visit. Chilli crabs with buns is a must order item. The otak (fish or prawn paste) in banana leaf is good too. I like to eat at the air conditioned 2nd floor but if you can stand the heat, the tables outside on the ground floor do have a nice breeze in the evenings
4
This was our second visit to the restaurant and this time crabs were not as tasty and fresh as the one we had last year. Somehow they didn't look like mud crabs. I'm not sure if we had to specify mud crab when we ordered as I would expect to be asked if there were options. None the less we loved all the dishes we ordered. The salted egged prawn were really yummy. Our Singaporean friends did not recommend this restaurant as they said it's for tourists and more expensive but I'm happy to return as their foods are tast
4
While the food maybe priced a little on the high side, it is a lovely location on a fine night to have dinner.We had a great dinner with friends with all the favourites - Chilli Crab, Cereal Prawns and even better, their Black Pepper Crab. Service was not five star but overall was relatively quick and the food was tasty - no complaints from the team.Kids enjoyed the location as they were able to walk and play along the waterfront as the adults continued with our dinner and chat.Overall a very pleasant evening at the iconic Jumbo
3
The location is nice but a bit overated for what it is. It is really the industry of chilly crab and to my view not the best. I prefer pepper crab personally!As a tourist, it is nice to see at occasions.On average it's ok and the prices should be decreased a bit with a friendlier staff looking for some attention would be great
1
Was in Singapore for vacation. We were seated quickly but then things went very bad. After ordering our food it sprinkled a few drops and everyone panicked. We were move to a sheltered table after drops had stopped. Waited 45 minutes for food to find us with some never arriving. Horrible service to wait for cold horrible food. After 1 1/2 was finally able to get the check and leave this mad house.The manager was insulting. Food way over priced. Definitely won't be wasting my time and effort going back

Jumbo is one of the most popular resturant in Singapore whereby loads of tourist will go for Chili crab, BBQ fish etc. Being a local, I must say that besides the nice location (along the beach, by the sea and option for air conditioning) it's surely not a place I will go again for the quality of food and price. Not because they are terrible, but they are many better options in this small little red dot when it comes to Chili crab & seafood. A group of 8 people went and have dinner. The service staff first mixed up drinks orders, and next forget to put in order for some. The cereal prawn is tasty but size of the individual prawn is really small. The Chili crab is average, it's not spicy at all (prob catered to tourist) and the black pepper crab is not impressive. You might think that I have high standards, but hey, price is above average, thus food standard should be reasonably good. If you are a tourist, and think that jumbo serves the best Chili crab and seafood, then I must say, you need to try other restaurants in singapore.
4
Apart from the 45 minute to 1 hour waiting time (without reservation) the food was really good. They have set menus depending on the amount of people in the group. This worked out at around SGD50 per person for a group of 4, excluding drinks.
5
There are two of them, one is at clark quey and the other is at ECP beach. Many variety of seafood and cooking and taste is delicious. This is best place for sea food lovers, visit the beach side one, its awesome
4
Friendly staff and good service.
Nice food. Yummy Chilli crab.
Utensils not very clean, especially the small plate still with some food stain (east coast park).
5
If you are in singapore you need to have the famous singapore chili crab. No matter what this is something you cannot miss and what better way to have it at Jumbo Seafood. Make sure you have a reservation :-)
4
There was a queue but the clever booking system at the restaurant was great - it said 90mins so we went off to Clarke Quay for a few drinks - 35 mins later we had the call to say our table ready! Ordered Chilli Crab and Black Pepper to compare - showed up our basic chopstick skills and made such a mess eating the crab which was delicious! I preferred the black pepper as the chilli sauce was quite tomatoey but my husband loved it.Busy busy place with large families having a great time but it is on the expensive side.Worth it for a trea
5
This seafood restaurant is famous for local seafood dishes, such as chili crab and bamboo clams. Hosted a dinner for some Hong Kong visitors and they were impressed with the quality of the food. The crabs can be cooked in a variety of ways and will recommend dinners to the restaurant to try all the different variety. There will definitely be on kind of cooking that suits your tast
4
Food worth a try but not that a must. One of the waitresses is terrible and we had to ask to change to another one before we really placed an order. We were definitely surprised by the level of service provided by the first one and were happy about the subsequent waiter. Service should never be sacrificed by business should it
4
Enjoyed lunch there with some local friends, it has a fantastic view of the bay and the Islands 40 mins away, the Crab is a must to eat, we sat down stairs as it was just a great day, the parking is easy and bus not far away from the Res
5
We had lunch at Jumbos at Clarke Quay and chose the chilli crab. We were told before we left home this was the specialty we had to have, and we weren't disappointed. The dish was sooo tasty! But the experience was something to write home about as well. Everyone wears a bib, and you need it too. Plastic gloves are also the go if having the crab. tge mango dessert is the best I have ever tasted as well. Put this on your list as a must do experience for your holiday in Singapore
3
It a yearly thing for me and my family.food is still the same not bad.but the service is getting worst, ask for gloves never came so I service myself,ask them to server the fried rice before the rest of the food when we are ordering end up fried rice never came till the 4th dish and we keep repeating telling them when the server the first dish,hope the service can be improved
5
Had three meals of crabs in Singapore and found the crab meat in Jumbo is the freshest. Good service, waitress and waiters were pleasant and nice. The table cloth are nearly brand new, very clean. Just the space is a bit crowded.
5
Don't miss!!! Any trip here you must go there and enjoy your dinner, the chili crab with your friends. Taste is excellent & Price is reasonable for Singapore. Look how much I m enjoyable555
4
Definitely can't go wrong with Jumbo. Had the Alaskan king crab both in Chilli and black pepper...... simply awesome! Standard of seafood is just as good if not better than longbeach.....
4
We booked ahead for our dinner with friend and the attentive waiting staff give us an outside table, the weather was so nice. We had chilli crab, black pepper crab which I preferred the former. Love it.
3
We have always came here and the food has been consistent but this time the food was still good but the service was very very slow we ordered soemthing to didn't even come after 30 minutes we asked the waiter to ask her again and it didn't come for another 45 minutes and finally after we asked the waiter for the third time it finally came.unacceptable...
4
Visited here my my Singaporean friends who ordered Black Pepper crabs, chilli crab and drunken prawns. Chilli crab is a Singapore must, and I always get it when staying with family here. Black pepper crab was a first, but it definitely won't be my last! Great flavour from all dishes. Great depth of flavour. Recommended over red house which I had previously reviewed as a must.
5
I have been to several other outlets of Jumbo but this is my first time to East Coast Jumbo. We didn't book so it took us about 30 minutes in queue to walk in. We were given a table almost the furthest to the main building, but nearest to the coast. It was far away from the air con but the sea breeze made the al fresco dining a good experience even after a hot day. Jumbo has the best chilli crab in Singapore that never fails. I also like that there is a friendly local lady taking care of just a few designated tables, and she is taking care of every detail of our needs which is good. Definitely worth 5 stars
4
We were lucky to get a table directly facing the sea. Must admit you have a real holiday feeling when you sit there, hear the ocean and eat good seafood. I have eaten several times as jumbo but this time the crab must have been so unbelievably fresh as it never tasted so good as that evening. We had pepper crab, cereal prawns , scallops in yam paste , Chinese greens and Hong Kong noodles. Everything was so delicious and tasty. Our friend from overseas was very impressed. Very good choice for a Singapore dinner
3
Had friends visiting from overseas and brought them to try out our local food. The food was reasonable, but service was rushed. For example, as my foreign friend did not know how to crack open the crab, we asked the service staff to help him. However, they did not seem very willing to do it and did a rushed job, resulting in some of the sauce splashing onto us. It was also not easy to get the attention of service staff at times
3
I had a meal here with my family and the food and service were very good. Fortunately I do eat some white fish and was able to have some delicious portions catered for my dietary needs. On the night of my visit the restaurant was very full and seems to be a popular place. I did not have a chance to look around outside as it was dark by the time I left. There is not much choice for vegetarians and for those who are gluten intolerant there are choices if you like seafood. I found while eating out in Singapore there are a variety of rice noodles to choose as well as steam rice or fry rice which I had for most of my meals while eating out in other places
4
So far this must be the best chilli crab I ever had, but on the price side it is considered higher than others. Next one I am eyeing for the pepper crab.
5
Went here with my coworkers on a business and ate so much yummy seafood!! You should try and get a reservation as they book up well in advance.
5
The chilli crabs and pepper crabs were delicious. The service was excellent. My wife put her hand bag on an empty seat and the waitress put a chair back cover over it making it secure so that it won't get pinched.
5
We had some great Chilli crab there. A great food in a great district. If you go there on holidays it is better to reserve your table in advance.
4
Maybe not an unique place, but somewhere not to miss when traveling to Singapore.
Excellent crabs, with spice or various recipes.
Plus view on harbour with tons of ship !
4
Jumbo Seafood created a very good first impression on Singaporean cuisine with their scrumptious chili crab and pepper crab. There is a wide selection of seafood to choose from, and eventhough they were closing already for mid afternoon (we came in for late lunch), they still accepted us. For this, I'll rate their service and customer satisfaction excellent
3
Yes it is a good spot to eat, nice view - and yes some of the food is ok (but it is not good value). I suggest you study the menu before you go, you may find some surprises.BUT The service is not good.In our case we ordered plates to share between 3 and wanted them all to arrive at the same time. Lobster was going to take 20 mins wait they said, fine with us we ordered another drink. One fish dish then arrived. We sent it back and asked for it all to be served at the same time (good luck getting the same server to talk to you if it is busy) so we keep explaining the same request over...Finally the food arrived but the dished were not freshly cooked (except the lobster), prawns were poor, fish has been under a heat lamp and was dried out...Overall pretty average and not an my list for a repeat visit.And there are better and cheaper places for the pepper crab if you must go for that..
4
The location in East Coast park and their service makes it a great place for dinner with family and friends. The black pepper crab and crab soup are really good. We also tried steamed fish and prawns, which was a little too sweet. But my favourite was venison (deer meat).
4
I have been here many times. Its a great place to enjoy vast variety of Seafood and party! Usually there is reservation if you want to get good seat. The signature dishes are Chilly Crab and Pepper Crabs, you can see it in almost all tables. That's the specialty and that's why people come here the most. We found Pepper crab more tastier than Chilly one.Due to the rush in the restaurant(which is normal) the waiter's were not attending us good even though we were a team of 10. Which they must improve
5
We went here for a treat for my husbands birthday. We had to order the Chilli Crab because of the good reviews. We were not disappointed. We did book in advance and had our table upstairs. The restaurant is very popular and busy. Could do better with a childrens menu. The food and drinks are definitely not cheap (especially the drinks). We paid $60.00 inc taxes for a their cheapest bottle of wine to help celebrate. It wasn't an expensive brand and was way overpriced. But for a special occasion it is worth the expense
5
The chili crab is delicious. Be prepared to get a little messy but it is so worth it. They give you a bib to help keep you clean. This is a must do while in Singapore!!
5
My first experience with crab and it was delicious... a good sweet/spicy mix. The fish was also very well cooked and the taste was incredible...Mango pudding was fresh and refreshing.
3
Not bad but not unique. Ordinary seafood in an oriental version. Not very tasty though. A table of 10 composed of people from all over the globe shared my views...
5
i always have to always visit jumbo for chilli crabs when stopping over to Singapore. the sauce and big crabs is to die for, if only they would open this all around the world.
5
Restaurant with tradition, great food and affordable prices. Wine list as well is good and well priced. Had a great cereal shrimp and chili crab. Few properties in city therefore it's easy to get there.
5
We came on a saturday night. We had not made a reservation but we were lucky and got a table anyway. The staff was really friendly. We ordered a set menu including apetizers, main course and dessert, consisting of several small dishes and of course the chili crab. The food was delicious. For four people we payed in total 280 SGD which was not too bad considering we got A LOT of food. Highly recommend this place.
5
This chain has several restaurants. On this occasion we visited the one in Ckarke Quay. Don't be put off by its sea food label, it has plenty for land lovers too. My colleagues took us for the crab. I don't eat crab but seeing as every bit was eaten by then I think we can safely assume it was good. I had the cod and some rice dish with stuff in which was also excellent. Despite being in a commercial tourist area the prices were typical for Singapore. Service was really good. Staff were polite and not over attentive but available when we needed them and despite them having two sittings an evening we were never rushed through our meal. Very enjoyable and I would definitely eat there again
5
ordered 6 meals, including chilli crab, black pepper crab, cereal prawn, kailan, noodles, and fried rice. All are tasty, especially the chilli crab. Hands down to one of the best i have ever tasted. Please make a reservation if you are coming with a large group as the restaurant can be fully booked during lunch/ dinnner hour. This restaurant might be a bit expensive for some people, there were 9 of us each paid $55
5
First of all, make a booking and secure your place. I dropped by and had to wait for my table. The time wasted, was very well compensated. The famous pepper crabs were fantastic, and I repeated my experience one more time. The place is clean, with a very good waiters attention
4
There are several "Jumbo Seafood" restaurants in Singapore. The Chilli Crabs are a must, spicy, sweet, succulent.The restaurant was packed. Mostly local people and some expats. Had the pleasure of eating with local business colleagues who know the place very well. We enjoyed crabs 2 different ways, scallops super fresh, great rice simple preparation, and for desert Sweet Yam with Gingko Nut.If you are in Singapore go and bring friends
5
The seating is a bit crowded, as the night is progressing, the busier it gets. The food is excellent, especially the chili crab and the Chinese doughnut ...must try when you are in Singapore
5
This is a popular and incredibly good place to eat seafood - from the chilli crabs to all kinds of fish. Perfect in a group, you can share all the goodies on the large tables.
5
The crabs are always big and succulent. Chilli crab is a must-order whenever we dine here. A go-to place for crabs and fried mantou. Service here is also excellent and prompt.
5
we always think of jumbo for special occassion. food and service does not disappointment. aside from crabs, we love the drunken/herbal prawns. i recommend advance reservation.
5
Order this dish every time when visit this place. Chilli crab alway have excellent taste. Fresh and most delicious compare to other crab from other restaurants.
Place alway full need to book in advance to get a good seat and shorter waiting time
5
It can't be more relaxed to eat in such a delicious restaurant, in an open area by the beach. You definitely need to try the chili crab, prawn, Malaysian style fried vegetable with cold lime juice, the most popular Singapore drink.
4
My wife and I went to this establishment(riverfront location) because we saw on Youtube it had the best chili crab. We were very well pleased with the food and the service. The crab was delicious. The only complaint I have is when you are seated, they automatically give you a small plate of peanuts and pour you some hot tea. Ordinarily this would not be a problem, nor would it have been a problem had they told us in advance they were going to charge us for the peanuts and hot tea. The charge wasn't much, but it would have been nice to know in advance what iwas going to be charged for
4
We arrived at a pack restaurant on a weekday. Authentic food, cooked to perfection. Ordered the pepper crab. Turned out to be huge. Portions are nice, the egg rice was large enough for 2 persons. Will visit again to try out the other items on the menu
3
this is an atmospheric, seafront restaurant. call to make reservations especially if you need the cooler and air conditioned upper floor.They manage large groups well and the location is great if there are little ones who want to wander along the grass outside. Guests always order the famed Black pepper crab or spciy chili crab (dont forget the mantou buns).Car parking is easy and lots of taxis to and from this location
5
we went there for dinner and did not know what to eat so we as and told to have chilly pepper grabs so we didFANTASTIC I'm not sure how to describe the BEST we drank a few beers and kept eating never I'm going to forget if any one goes to Singapore must visi
5
I have eaten at Jumbo as well as other seafood restaurant. I think I still like Jumbo the best. I think it is pricey but that is the price you have to pay. We enjoyed both the chilly as well as the salted egg crab.
5
I flew to Singapore in March, just to eat Jumbo again. Though many people like chillycrab, the black pepper crab is my first priority.
3
We stayed there last week. Food was good but the atmosphere was more than in an seafood McDonald's. Crowds,
Plastic chairs and the service like just good enough. I not go there again for sure.
4
Went there on our final night at Singapore. You have to make sure you book a table at least a week in advance.
Service was mediocre, but the chilli crab was really good.
5
Visiting mid week on a recommendation. Great range of seafood cooked traditionally Chinese. Service was quick, food excellent, but not the cheapest. Definitely worth a visit to this popular seafood restaurant.
3
As usual the crab was great and the rest was typical seafood that you can have anywhere in Singapore. Although I find it very expensive. Just enjoy your meal and forget the bill.
5
Superb place for authentic sea food don't miss out their pepper crabs and award winning chilli garlic crabs superb ambience and awesome location and clarke Quays river side view they also have their signature jumbo spices don't miss out
5
My fav. place for chilli crabs, drunken prawns, scallops and asparagus and 3 types of eggs with vegetables! I go to Jumbo Riverside once a week! Being a seafood lover, I am happy that Jumbo serves great food consistently!!
4
This is a real mecca for locals and tourists alike. Upstairs is air-con and downstairs is open air. Most tourists prefer upstairs - it's also less noisy...The deep fried bread (mantao) is a must to dip in the sauce of the must order chilli crab (red, sweetish like tomatoe based sauce) or the black pepper crab (with a more sharp flavour). Both are so delicious I always ensure we have enough people so we can order both! I also think the scallops and oyster omelette are spectacular here. A hit every time
4
We tried both black pepper crab and chilli crab. We like the chilli crab more! The price is slightly above average but worth a try. The waitress here are well experience, if you not sure what you want to order as side dishes, you may check with them. It might surprise you.
5
As usual the food is good and fast services. No complaints.
Look at the gorgeous big chill crabs. It was delicious and come with soft buns.
Open air sea view... enjoy the sea breezes..
5
This is one of the best. So good you usually have to stand in line to get seated. Right on ocean front on Singapore's East Coast.
4
The best and largest crabs you could eat are definitely at Jumbo. Will burn a hole in your pocket though. The other regular items are fairly priced and good value for money though.
4
You will be doing yourself a favor for ordering cereal prawn and black pepper crab... pls skip chili crab... at least I am not a fan of it... :)
4
Long wait time as we didn't have a reservation but was totally worth it! Best Singapore Chilli Crab we've had and the fried bread buns were perfect. Would definitely go back there.
3
We found the food lovely, meal sizes small and very expensive. Very popular need to book or expect to wait a while to get a table.
5
Jumbo has been on my must visit list for all trips to Singapore. The chilling mud crab with sweet white rolls is the best chili crab anywhere. Make sure you make a reservation otherwise you can face long waits and bad tables.
5
Short waiting time, amazing seafood especially the pepper crab and the chilli crab. We ordered fried rice (portions are huge) and Tiger beer. Overall amazing food, a bit expensive but worth it!
4
A bit pricey but food is good. Great location and always busy. Try the crab its probably a signature dish. Worth a visit probably won't go back as our bill was $1500 for 6 of us
5
The place to be if you are a sea food fan. Its a bit pricy but worth the price. Its hard to find a table even when the whole restaurant is a big place. We shared our table with 2 other couples as we did not want to wait for a table. Crabs, clams and fish all ever excellent in taste
5
Sitting outdoors and enjoying a nice Tiger beer and spicy crab is an experience that shouts out SINGAPORE. I like Jumbo Seafood and I really like location. Staff is very friendly and attentive.
4
Jumbo is an excellent seafood restaurant, especially the crab. However every dish we ate was delicious and full of flavour and exciting ingredients. One downside is the prices are pretty high compared to other similar menu's in Singapore
5
Simply amazing. I'd return to Singapore just to here. Order Chili Crab and fried buns and embrace the mess!
4
Grand food attack - Chilli Crab, Fried prawn cereal, baby Kallang, prawn fried rice, fried buns, special bean curd, coconut water & tea. Celebrating the inaugural of Nicolai Friedrich- The Worlds Best Mentalist in APAC. This can be so much fun!!
5
Went on a weekday before 6pm and got a table without waiting! Love the pepper and curry crabs. Sauce was delicious and the meat was fresh and tasty! Will go again next time visiting Singapore.
5
A great place to try the Chiili Crab.
Excellent views into the harbour
We could have sat here all night
A must visit
4
The food and atmosphere at this restaurant is great. We had the Chili Crabs. Hard to eat but good! A Must have food while in Singapore. The restaurant is very popular one but has many locations. We had to wait a while and were seated inside versus outside but the food did not disappoint
5
A great view over the water, big tables with tons of chilli or pepper crab meals. Simply great and a real experience. It doesn't matter how often I go to this restaurant, it is always fun and I enjoy the food. Of the Jumbo choices in Singapore - this is the best.
5
My husband and I ate here while on vacation and we are soooo happy that we tried it, The dinner set menu was great. We ordered so much food and the prawns are mandatory! They are sprinkled with some sort of seasoned cereal coating that just melts in your mouth. Its kinda pricey but well worth the price. The drinks were perfect. The Chili crab was good, but be ready for the spice. There is also a cous cous that taste just as good the next day. Do yourself a favor and enjoy this restaurant while in Singapore. Definitely worth the price
5
Its been a few months we haven't got any crab craving. However, when we happened to pass by Jumbo Seafood recently, the smell of chili cab got us "invited". We just couldn't wait for that dish to be served and it really didn't disappoint us! Its their signature dish and a must try!
3
Quite a touristy place famous for their Chilli and Pepper Crabs. A bit expensive, but overall good food. for dinner you will need a reservation almost always.
4
Disappointing. Place was packed to the hilt on the eve of a public holiday, but that's no excuse to compromise on the food. Some dishes were not even hot.
5
Amazing!! The crab is awesome. We had both the chili and the pepper crab. Delicious!!
We had some other things as well, scallops, drunken shrimp, etc. They were good, but the crab is just great, so save room for it!!
5
I enjoyed the dinner I had here of Chili crab, Pepper crab, fried squid, and veggies. Everything was cooked nicely. The service was not very friendly, but that is normal for this locale.
3
We were a group of 18 from different countries around the world, all of us use to travelling a lot. This place although famous for its crab, for us didn't live up to its renome! Price was high and location os good, but Singaporean chilli and pepper crab you can find better in other places elsewhere.Advise, try first this spesiality other places in Singapore before using a lot of money in this one.Service is good and friendly
4
I loved the place and its location on the river.You are surrounded by locals which is always a good sign. I had chilli crab, shrimps rice, duck salad and shrimp soup. Food was excellent and the service is very good. Try the local beer tiger. It is expensive but worth going a least once. My bill was 100 Singaporean dollars. I will definitely go back next time I am in Singapore.
5
not being a seafood afficiando i agreed to attend this staple of singapore at the urging of the family. the outdoor setting is obviously weather dependent but fortunately we enjoyed a balmy clear night. the service is helpful and knowledgeable . some may find the floors etc less tidy and clan than they'd like but we were prepared for this and enjoyed the chilli crab (superb) , prawns, scallops and some cold beers. highly recommended and good to enjoy a restaurant whose reputation was matched by its performance
4
This restaurant was recommended to us by one of the local drivers we used, this is their "Sunday family dinner" type of spots. We went here so the place was not packed but as it got close to dinner time, it got full pretty quick. Seafood here is great, be prepared to see some items you have never ate before, like fin shark soup, which was pretty good, Lobsters were amazing. A must visit, if you want to eat like a local
4
Went to both Jumbo East Coast and Jumbo Dempsey this month. Both are good but I think Dempsey is more refine but consistency is there for food standard. With a big group this time, we have the chance to try 3 types of crabs at Dempsey: Chilli / Pepper / Salted Egg. Will recommend the Chilli and Pepper Crab for Jumbo as we have tried better salted egg crab elsewhere. All other items we ordered were good too.A little pricey though, 3 crabs weighing 4kg+ and a steam fish alone cost us almost $500 with the total bill comes up to $800 for 8 adults and 3 young children without alcohol in the beverage list.However, it is still a good place for Singapore seafood
4
First- a taxi here from the CBD is cheap.Second- we didn't make a booking (2 of us) on a Saturday night at peak hour for dinner and we didn't have to wait for a table at all. They just ushered us straight in.We ordered fried rice, egg prawns and of course, the 1kg chilli crab. They warned us that the food may be a 45 min wait but it came out really fast.The food was delicious but it was pretty expensive. All up- 3 beers, small dish of prawns, small fried rice and the chilli crab cost us around $200.But it's well worth eating the Singapore signature dish by the seaside at least once :-

I have no doubt that this chain restaurant has very good menu, fresh sea food and delicious meals. However prices are really ridiculous when you take into account service quality and ambiance.
4
It is a chosen place every time we wanna enjoy the fresh seafood. It is quite pricey but the great taste especially their signature chili crab.
4
Visited this branch for the first time. Food quality so so and price of crab is market rate. Around $78/kg which I thought it is quite expensive.

ต้องไปรอคิวเพราะคนเยอะมาก เมนูแนะนำ Chilli Crab ทำคล้ายๆ ปูผัดผงกระหรีบ้านเรา เนื้อหวานมาก ปูตัวนึกหนักตัวละขั้นต่ำ 1 กิโล ไปทานที่ Jumbo Seafood Riverwalk ตั้งอยู่ที่ถนน Upper Circular
Lunch: 12pm – 3pm (last order at 2.15pm)
Dinner: 6pm – 12am (last order at 11.15pm)

The best introduction to Singaporean cuisine. Their standard of Chili Crab has climbed back to prominence.
5
If you are in Singapore, and you haven't had Jumbo, you have missed out big time! We had the giant crabs and the lobsters, amazing food! I would go back in a heartbeat for such food!
5
First time in this restaurant. We eat a lot of fish (of course), but especially the black pepper crab was delicious. We ate also the crab in chili. Food, beer and good dessert. Also a coconut was there to complete the meal ;). You have to go here!
5
If you have chance to visit Singapore and have time, you should take your lunch or dinner at Jumbo Seafood Restaurant. The signature dish is "Chili Crab" The taste was so good. But it took long times for the queue. If you walk in, you need to reserve seats and they will give you a code. Once your seat is ready, the staff will call you.So I recommend you that you should come before 6 pm for dinner. The taste is so delicious !!!!

Although we had made a booking we found dining time to be rushed, service was rushed and poor, some people's meals at the table were forgotten and restaurant staff had to be reminded on several occasions. At the conclusion of our dinner we were given the bill and told that we had 5 minutes to make payment and to vacate the restaurant.All and all a very poor dining experience and wouldn't recommend this restaurant to others

Crowded restaurant- but could get seat for five of us without waiting. Seating was very close to near by table and need to be careful -to avoid touching others .Alaskan chilly crab was offered for S$140/- per Kilo minimum 2.3 Kilo ie S$322/- + taxes - good for two. But we went for SrilLankan crab S$ 78/- Per kilo. We ordered Chilly crab and Pepper crab. Plate given for Crab waste was too small and was overflowing. Serving staff was good
5
Very good food and not just seafood but all kinds. Very nice open air ambiance (Clarke Quay). Good place for people-watching too
5
Every time were in Singapore we go to this restaurant. Amazing chili crab and black pepper crab - absolutely amazing food and service. The best restaurant in Singapore, and if youre ever visiting, dont hesitate to come here.
5
The setting (besides East Coast Park) and the food is an amazing combination. You have to try the fried buns, pepper and chilli crab dishes, kailan with garlic and chicken fried rice. A nice place to spend c. 60 mins
3
Jumbo still has good food but really getting too expensive now and portions seem to be shrinking. Wasn't a nice experience with my last family meal there. We ordered what would be our usual amount but it wasn't filling enough because the servings seem to have gone down while prices went the other direction
4
casual setting open air with views to the seas and sunset allowing kids to run around before and after the meals. chilli crabs with fried or steam buns one of a must have dish with steam bamboo clamps. drunken steam prawns is also a specialty. steam fish is an acquired taste but most foreigners love the deep fried garoupa or BBQ tilapia fresh water fish. for Vege, choose kangkong with sambal chilli. those who are drinking, order small fried squids which go very well with cold beer
3
Because of the nice location, their prices were twice as much than other seafood restaurants in Chinatown. We also couldn't eat their noodle dish (too sweet). Maybe we just ordered wrong, but we wouldn't come back when there is better tasting and cheaper food all over the city.
4
Will always bring overseas friends & relatives to this restaurant as they serve up the best Chilli and Pepper Crabs. Never a let-down. Friends and relatives are always impressed by the freshness and the size of the Sri Lankan crabs. Each pincher can be as big as an adult's palm
5
I was advised by a local to go here for the famous Singapore Chili Crab. Absolutely delicious. This is obviously a very popular restaurant so a reservation is a good idea. We didn't have a reservation but we're lucky to score a table with a stipulation that we finished by a certain time, and that was fine. Be prepared to pay $100+ for the Chili crab but it's worth it. Another good idea is to take disposable plastic gloves. Sounds funny I know, but the table next to us came prepared and were using these gloves, we commented to them what a great idea and she gave me a pair. Makes eating that crab so much easier.
5
My friend and I returned to Jumbo in February and enjoyed chili crab with Tiger Beer. This Jumbo is located at the East Coast Seafood Centre right by the water. Sitting here in the evening with an excellent seafood meal is a highlight of any trip to Singapore. In addition to the crab we ordered the asparagus with scallops. Everything was delicious! Hint: if you order the chili crab, be sure to order some of the hot buns to soak up the gravy. MMMM
5
We had heard that the Singapore crab served at Jumbo Food was one of the best, and our expectations were realised by the food we received. We are glad we only ordered crab as the dish was almost more than my wife and I could manage.Excellent
5
This place is a must go to all seafood lovers! The food here is amazing! Tried the award winning Chilli crab and it was unbelievable. The prawns, the baby squid, the oysters... it was an unbelievable experience. Highly recommended!
5
Really love the Chilli crab, pepper crab and bamboo clam here!! My yearly birthday treat for myself!! It's also a place I'd bring overseas visitors for a meal and it never fails to impress them!! Would highly recommend!!
4
Nice food and portion was enough with reasonable price. Staffs and team was fast and responsive. Good restaurant 👍
4
one of the best places in singapore to have crabs/seafood. but please make a reservation in advance as the queues can be crazy long, and ask for indoor seating as the extended rain shelters are pretty useless when the rain comes.
5
The place serves one of the best crabs in Singapore. You have to try the authentic Singapore Red chilli crabs here.
They also serve some brilliant bread to go with the gravy.
Not to mention the happening view of Clark Quay
5
Went to the East Coast outlet with relatives from Hong Kong. They were so impressed by the freshness and the size of the Sri Lankan crabs. The size of the pincher was as big as an adult palm!!The restaurant was full house that night but service was still prompt and courteous. All the dishes we ordered were also cooked to perfection. All of us had a wonderful meal and were still reminiscing about the experience several days later. Definitely must revisit
5
This place is simply amazing. It was my second time dining at Jumbo restaurant.Travel Tip: Book your reservation online and save you a lot of time from waiting. Book a table in an Air Conditioned room and it is much comfortable:)On my first visit, I was at the East Coast food center, and my second trip was at the Riverside Point area. Both were places had great service reputation.The chili crab, salted egg shrimp, and the seafood fried rice was fantastic. Don't forget to order the bread roll to dip with the chili sauce!This is a must do food trip in Singapore
4
Came here for dinner with the family. The place was packed! However, we made a booking. Be sure to if you want to dine here. The service was a bit slow, down to the sheer amount of people here. There were hundreds! The food was good, but what stood out the most was the black pepper crab. It was delicious. Best I've had. Drinks selection was a bit limited, but ok. Overall a nice meal
4
We took a visit here to experience some of Singapores best known dish - chilli crab.We were fitted with paper aprons which feels weird but breaking the shell of crab can create an explosion so it was warranted.We had a great feast here and left completely satisfied, but for me the stand out was the sauce... could not get enough.Delicious and memorable
4
Went here with colleagues. Good food, chilli crab was great! Though you pay for everything, when you are seated, they give you nuts and tea. Great idea but you pay for them even though they are not ordered. We had 5 people for the banquet but their option was for 4 or 6, and by default they charged for 6. The first 2 wines we ordered were unavailable - so had to go for a more expensive option. Overall a good experience, but we did get sticker shock at the end when we got the bill
3
It was great chilli crab, but not really sure what the fuss is all about? There are so many great restaurants and bars in Singapore...try as many as you can!
4
Had no reservation but went Clarke Quay and only waited 20 minutes - our Chilli Crab was so good - very highly recommended and reasonably priced 😛
5
Went with Singaporean friends who we had asked to take us where they would go. Great spot overlooking sea and ships. Big and busy but quick service. Chili and pepper crab are great. Even liked the waitress telling me off for not eating all the meat in my claw. Lovely
5
Visited it 2 times this month , good place to enjoy sea food. The thing need to improve is the discount voucher given , all come with funny term & condition , can only use at certain timing , use at Certain outlet . So if want to give discount voucher , plan the thing well so got repeat customer, if not , many will be unhappy and disappointed. Two differ visit , 2 differ Staffs servicing attitude , overall still above average.
5
One of Singapore's iconic food locations - as it's known to the locals: the Chilli Crab on east coast park. Always full, but you can always get a table. Huge area full of busy waiters and waitresses, some elderly and experienced, serving great selection of local dishes. The Chilli Crab is of course the most famous one, but do also try others, they are worth it. Oh and Tiger beer galore
3
Selection is limited for the ala carte ordering compared to most dimsum restaurnat. but the 3 eggs porridge is a must try! the perception is that siince their IPO, the food standards has dropped and the chilli crabs are not as nice as before.price wise is still affordable.they have this lucky draw for car and a better CRM program now but i wonder is this is at the cost of the diners ..
5
i went with my boyfriend who doesn't eat seafood. The standard chili crab is 1.3kg @$78 per kilo it was far too much for me so as they weren't busy they did me a special 800g crab which cost $62 - far more affordable for 1 person and reasonable to eat. it was absolutely delicious and i made a complete mess of myself but it was a great experience and the sauce was AMAZING delicious crab cooked well! it's a must even if your boyfriend (like mine) doesn't eat seafood there are other dishes available!
3
We went as a group of four on a Sunday night so I didn't expect it to be packed. We were seated quickly although getting our orders in took a bit. We had our crabs and dishes on the table after about 35 minutes. The crabs were good and while we finished everything, the food was a bit pricey and service was a bit of a letdown for the price. With crabs, you would have a bit of a mess on the table but we had no one coming to clear the table. While the food is good, the service and value were a bit lacking
3
Friends who have been to Singapore before insisted that I had to eat their signature dish of chili crab. I had gone to a night market earlier in the week and found them to be ok, nothing amazing, but when drinking profusely, somewhat satisfying. Two nights later, we go for our reservation an order the same thing. Perhaps lacking the level of intoxication raised my standards but I wasn't struck by any great differences between the two. The location is quite nice and the wait staff attentive but maybe I don't know enough about chili crab to appreciate the differenc
3
Had the most wonderful evening here at the Jumbo floating Restaurant. The boat ride out to the restaurant and the vibrant colours of the restaurant, plus the atmosphere was unique. It was a lot of fun. Only negative was the low standard of the food. However we were on a tour with a group of about 30 so that may have contributed to this. Overall the experience of being on a floating Restaurant out weighed the disappointment of the food
4
Love their chili crab seasoning. The crab is great and the sauce is perfect. We always order the chili crab and eat it with rice.
3
It is one of the most famous restaurants in SG, but I think it is too popular for their actual food and service.The tables are too small and placed too closely, so they could take more customers. I literally sat right next to the person who was sitting next. It was not delightful at all.Mostly, the service of staffs was horrible. I think will never be going again
4
Crab is always my favorite dish and this is the best restaurant in Singapore for crabs. While chilli crabs and black pepper crabs are among the most popular items, the restaurant actually serves many varieties of cooking styles and tastes. Booking in advance is not mandatory, but walk-in customers may have to wait for 45 minutes to get a table
2
This restaurant was recommended by the hotel concierge & others, so we went there with high hopes for the Pepper Crab & the Chilli Crab. Unfortunately the reality did not live up to our expectation. There were 4 of us at dinner. We ordered champagne & it arrived opened & warm. We brought it to the attention of the staff & their solution was to put it in an in an ice bucket. They eventually understood that the drink has to be cold before it goes in the ice bucket and brought out cold bottle. The crab arrived - it was ok but nothing really spectacular - especially not for the price. And one of our guests had an allergic reaction that night (settled by antihistamines). Not really a great experience. Would not recommend
3
Had the famous Chilli Crab here which was a wonderful experience although we found it far too fiddly to enjoy the meal itself. The stars were the cereal prawns though - they were delicious. Service rather hit and miss as they forgot our drinks. Very expensive though so won't be back for a while
5
My friend has always promised to take me here, so finally the time came as I passed through town.She ordered me cilli crab and a host of other dishes with prawns and vegetables. The chilli crab was excellent. The 1 kg size was huge for me and took me some time to extract every morsel. All tasty and very well prepared. The buns made the perfect accompaniment. The position on the coast is great; the cool evening breeze makes a nice change from the city. The view of incoming commerce to the harbour is quite special at night.I guess it cost a bomb, but as with Singapore hospitality, as a guest, I never found out.All washed down with a few cold Tigers. We found the service excellent, which I think arriving early helped.Recommended

The title sums it all up! After a disappointing dinner at the Jumbos in Riverwalk we were really hoping Jumbos East Coast rectify our belief in Jumbos! We went with friends this time round on a Sunday night with no reservation. We waited 5 minutes and had a table outside, the sun was setting and we managed to get a view of the sea with ships surrounding Singapore. The East Coast area is ideal for a night away from the city, lots of families and friends gathering for a Sunday night dinner.We ordered satay chicken, Singaporean Chilli Crab, Salted Egg Prawns, otah and those yummy fried buns! The chilli crab sauce was exactly what we were after, it's everything we remember it to be and much better than Riverwalk. The staff were very patience and we had all the cutlery and utensils without having to chase staff.Thank you for keeping your consistency and thank you for allowing us to enjoy our meal without being rushed. It was great to enjoy the same chilli crab after two years !

We have been to this place slightly earlier than the opening time so we spent the time exploring the water front and take in the views and also tried the beach. The sand was white but a little dirty with some glasses so bare feet may not be easy to walk on. There are no tap to wash the feet as it doesn't look like a good place to dip the water with all the ships nearby. We saw some lizards in the walkway so it was quite interesting. The seats in the restaurant is of plastic material so it isn't very comfortable but it was plenty of space for everyone to enjoy the food. The service was ok, quick and right to the point. There are no much ambience of the place but just a simple eatery place. Grest and fresh seafood, we had ordered:- two plates of chilli crabs: very tasty and one of our friends even take the sauce back to cook pasta with, yum yum- one plate of pepper crab: a little messy, tasty although as we all prefer chilli crab the best- broccoli steamed: we have asked for it to be cooked this way as we didn't want everything fried and oily- Chinese vegetable fried with garlic: very tasty - Prawn in gold and silver egg: this dish wasn't loved by all of us as some thought it tastes a little funny as the eggs wasn't normal salty egg taste- razor clams steamed with vermicelli: this was really tasty but when the bill came out, we were a little shocked as it worked out about SGD 14-15 per each razor clam. It costs around £3-£5 in a good restaurant setup in London so we were pretty surprised at the costs hereWe also ordered another prawn dish and it tastes good. We didn't ordered any fish here as the shellfish were the main course at this place. Our local friend said that the fish dish are generally quite expensive here. Toilet was pretty close to the kitchen so there are loads of people walking around so be careful when you opened the door as it sometimes can open right into people waiting to use the toilet or walk into someone carrying heavy loads of dishes when you get out
3
Good food and tasty as usual but service is absolutely terrible and waiters not polite. Few people rushing around for too many tables. Also the ambiance is non-existent even though the restaurant is close to the water. Why don't certain Chinese Restaurants pay attention to these details that can improve their establishments by 90%
5
We came here with family and ordered a dozen or so dishes. They all tasted great!The highlight of my meal wasn't the crab though... It was the bamboo clams in garlic and vermicelli. Oh my goodness, it was so tender and flavourful, we all decided to order a second round even though we were stuffed! Highly recommend the seafood here (especially the bamboo clams!
5
We had the privilege of eating at this fine seafood establishment. The crabs were fresh and succulent. Thank you!
5
We went to Jumbo for lunch it was our 30th wedding anniversary. We had the pumpkin prawns & the chilli crab . AMAZING!!!
5
Great place to try chili crab- one of the landmark dishes. Crabs are big, delicious, prepared to eat, so that you do not struggle much. Although it does get messy :). Yummy yummy!
5
This place deserves all the hype. It is always full so book in advance. If you are not fussed about a table then walk in works fine. The chilli crab easily serves 2. Should definitely try it with a rice dish!
3
I have been talking to my husband for years about Jumbo Chilli Crab and those glorious buns! So whilst in Singapore we met friends there for dinner. It was a little more chaotic than normal here and service was not too good - a couple of our dishes arrived quickly, then had to wait for ages for the others. Chilli Crab was amazing as always but poor service put a damper on our night.
4
Even my Hong Kong Foodie book for Singapore recommends going there. So we did and it was indeed pretty good. No booking as we just walked in with only a 10 minutes wait for a table. Yes, the chilli crab was good but extremely messy to eat: don't wear your light colour clothing there :-). Don't order the chef's special chilli sauce fish (small chucks of deep fried fish) the chucks are too small and by the time it is fried there not too much meat left to eat. Service is acceptable, but don't bring your N.American-Europe level of expectations there as you will be disappointed as you will be disappointed
5
Ok, that's was my first experience of eating crabs! Thanks to my colleagues It's a great place! And not only the restaurant itself, but the area also where the restaurant is located.Food is very very tasty! We've got not crab only. We tried many different dishes, and all of them have been very very good!". Highly recommended
5
We were treated to a fantastic meal here by close friends and could not fault the meal. Friendly staff, met the owners and had the most enormous and delicious crab and squid. I have to confess I've always been a lover of chilli crabs and this was my first taste of pepper crabs but this was delicious and it's jumped to the front of the line of crab dishes to eat again. The salted egg prawns were a revelation. Fantastic night with a tremendous view of what has to be the busiest port.
4
On a work dinner with coworkers, we decided to visit this place. They quickly seated us, but told us we had to be finished by 730pm (and we sat down at 645pm). The lamb and prawns were excellent, but once we finished eating the hostess basically tried to rush us out of the restaurant.
4
The most popular Seafood Chinese Style restaurant in Singapore. Without visiting here, your Singapore trip will not be unique.Nevertheless, foods are nothing special except the Black Pepper Crabs. I believe Jumbo insists using high quality black pepper corn that has very different and strong fragrance. The Green grey water Crabs believe came from India Ocean countries like Sri Lanka and therefore are more salty than Thailand or HongKong. Because of this, the Black Pepper is just good for it. In comparing to their Chili Crabs, it is a failure. Thai style curry crabs or chili garlic crab of HongKong are much better. They shud make some improvements to this.Service here is okay but the price is slightly overpriced
5
Everything was great! We had fish, shrimp and crab. The the sea to the plate...FRESH! The service and the staff were very friendly. Definitely will return.
4
Tried black pepper crab at this place and found it wonderful and delicious. Though we arrived bit earlier before 5 pm we were accepted and served promptly. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Would love go there again!!!
3
We had dinner at 2 of their locations. For sure East Cost has a very nice atmosphere, but lacks the service. Their paper sacuce crab is very delicious.
4
We were one night in Singapore and our friends took us here. The chilli crabs and pepper crabs were delicious. The staff's English was limited, but was not a big issue.
1
My husband and I went to the Jumbo in the East Coast Park. It was my 60th birthday and I love seafood and so we chose to go there after reading the good reviews.However, I should have read the 'Terrible' reviews as well because that was the experience we had. From start to finish it was not relaxing and hard to make ourselves understood as none of the staff spoke English very well.The staff were abrupt and we felt as if they were trying to get us in and out of the restaurant as quickly as possible in order to get as many people as possible served in one night (more money made that way).They tried to put peanuts and tea on our table when we sat down, but we refused them, and later when we got the bill we saw that they would have been chargeable had we accepted them.We asked for a bottle of Prosecco at the beginning (the only one on the drinks menu), and they said it had run out and pointed to expensive bottles of Champagne at twice the price saying that they had those. We complained asking how a restaurant of that size has Prosecco on the menu but runs out. What happened to the re-order of stock routine, before an item actually runs out? We told them to double check, and they came back saying they had made a mistake and that they did have Prosecco after all. I think they pull this trick to entice you to buy a more expensive bottle, and I am sure many people would fall for it.They tried to hurry us into ordering and stood at the table impatiently, but when we said we wanted more time, they walked away and never came back until we had to spend time trying to hail one of them down to take our order.We ate the baby fried squid which I have had in many restaurants before, but this was disgusting as was the sea cucumber, but perhaps that's disgusting wherever you go. The rest of the food was mediocre, the scallops and broccoli dish being the best, albeit a bit tasteless
5
The views of the East Coast seaside can be viewed from Jumbo Seafood East Coast especially you can enjoy excellent ambience but limited space in the only air-conditioned Level 2 of the restaurant. Otherwise, you can sit on Level 1 where seabreeze is abundance in supply and lots of outdoor seats around.The seafood, of course needless to say, are fantastic especially chilli crabs, steamed crabs and salted-egg crabs are really saliva-dropping best! You can even smell the aroma on your fingers after you washed your hands eating those crabs. The braised Shark Fin's soup with crab meat is just one the dishes never to be missed.Service is not as excellent as the food provided on the table. Sometimes you need to remind and remind again when it is extremely busy.
5
This is a great restaurant right on the water in Singapore. The food is excellent and the view is wonderful. In the evening it is perfect for watching the sunset. We had the Chili Crab and the Black Pepper Crab (there were 6 of us) and they were both delicious
3
If you have spent any time in Singapore then Jumbo is probably more of a tourist spot than a regular place to visit. The seafood is good but the service is inattentive and jaded as if table turn was the top priority. If you want a relaxed night on the crab then Newton Circus isn't a bad option with open air tables and attentive service. See if you can find Stanley who will get you the best crab and coldest beers in Singapore
3
We booked the place in advance as we were there on a Saturday evening. Somehow the dishes were not consistent. Some dishes have the "wok hei", while some dishes is a tad too salty. We like the fried rice, pepper crab, kangkong and sweet & sour pork. Nevertheless, this is a good place to go for seafood. Just hope that their food is more consistent.
5
They may not be the creator of Chilli Crab or Pepper Crab, but their outlet at the East Coast Park, is perfect for entertaining oversea visitors who want a great gastronomy experience of Singapore's Seafood. Come early for a sundowner at the outdoor sitting and enjoy the tropical sunset. They have the entire selection of Singapore Signature seafood dishes: Deep Fried baby squids, Drunken Prawn, Crabs and Fish dishes in a dozen different cooking method, to the expensive lobster, abalone and rear shellfish. I have been visiting them since the late 80s for more than a hundred times, when we think of seafood, we come to JUMBO - Over all the best in Singapore. Oh yes, you could bring you own wine FOC when you buy a bottle from them, for 4 person's 6-course dinner with wine, it cost about S$80 per head. PS They serve great mango too
5
Not the first time here, but friends were paying the first visit to Singapore and Jumbo. We overloaded on pepper crab and chilli crab along with many other delights. Excellent food as always and great service. Just maybe the veggies could come a bit sooner!
2
Busy place, crew overworked and waiters not so attentive, food was ok nothing spectacular, will avoid on weekends and public holidays
5
Nice tipical restaurante with river view.
Very well located and excellent food.
The most famous is the spicy Crab that you enjoy eating with your hands and make a big pleasent mess ( In a good way ).
5
Setting along the bay is fabulous! Food was wonderful but get ready for a mess! We had the pepper crabs and chili crabs - both wonderful. Brought our infant granddaughter with us - perfect spot as it's quite lively and that lulled her to sleep. A MUST GO while in Singapore
4
I love singapore chilli crab. Have been to the other 2 branches (riverside and riverwalk), and always read a review that East Coast one is the best one. Couldnt agree more. The taste is richer than the other branches, and the place is stunning with off coast view. After dinner, we could walk along the east coast. The downside is that this place is not reachable by MRT. Another tips, dont ask for mineral water, it took more time for them to deliver mineral water than to make the chilli crab itself..
3
Food was all right, consistent on that score with previous visits. The pepper crab for 4 people was poorly cooked and priced at $90. Our family consists of crab fans from Singapore and Paris and it was a downer for us all. Delicious, beautifully cooked crab is available at coffee shops in the vicinity
3
Well if you heard of the rave about the chilli crab & the seafood in Singapore, this is sort of an iconic seafood restaurant for you to have your craving satisfy. It may be a little pricy but definitely worth the try. Nice embiance & good service. Of course there are also lots of others for you to try
5
It was recommended to us to go here for Chili Crab, and we were not disappointed!It is expensive but it was absolutely delicious! The wait staff was great which made it a fantastic experience !My daughter said the restrooms were disgusting .... so plan accordingly ....Kind of shameful for such a nice place
2
We arrived at this restaurant with high expectations and great recommendations. Whilst the food was very good, the service was nothing short of terrible. The meals came out at all different times, and in one case not at all. Prices were not explained, and the way they charge abalone was very cryptic and obscene. When we tried to explain what we had ordered, we were told it was our fault not their's
5
I had yet another opportunity to visit Singapore recently and wasted no time to make a beeline for Jumbo Eastcoast Seafood restaurant, which I know well from past visits. The Chili Crab was delicious & spicy together with Fried Chicken in dry Chili, Yang Chow fried rice, topped with Mango Custard and sweet lychees for desert. My friend, Shirley Goh, lead receptionist, was as ebullient and gracious as ever. With a spectacular view of the waterfront and platoon of ships, it was exactly the experience I wanted. I highly recommend JUMBO Eastcoast Seafood restaurant if you visit clean Singapore
4
It was quite sometime ago when we celebrate our CNY reunion dinner at Jumbo Rest.
The food and dishes are well organised and delicious with good health caution. I will recommend any company annual dinner or gatherings at Jumbo Rest. with branches in Singapore.
5
Excellent food and recommendation by the server. The satay queue was a slight setback due to too many customer orders. Other than that the seafood taste really good, service is very efficient and food came very fast
5
We brought our Australians friends for dinner on Sunday & they thoroughly enjoyed themselves...the Chilli crab is TDF (to die for)...said our friends; However the plate of vegetables we ordered was enough for 1 person only...it was sooo little 9not worth the price!!!)
5
Huge variety of dishes and very good quality. They have the best Chilli crab in Singapore and their East Coast outlet has the best sharks cartilage soup. Seafood is always fresh and the views by the sea breath taking.
4
Best chilli crab i ever tasted in Singapore .
Other dishes are also quite well done compare to other restaurant.
Prices -$100 per head
4
Here is a nice restaurants with nice food. Not only food was good but also I want to give yhe device staff a five stars award. Plate was change once they saw abit of our left over. One more thing I like most is the ambience which I like to dine outside the aircon area where I enjoy my dinner with my loved one under the stars.
4
Guided by a local, happy to have found this restaurant, where you also find many locals. Superb crab, both black pepper, and chilli. Lively, popular, crowded place. Good to reserve a table.A good choice for going out with good friends, leisure, less formal.A must if you are a crab fan
2
the much touted chilli crab was a bit of a let down. the crab size is medium small. For that price I was expecting a decent size Sri Lankan crab with big pincers. Service was average and the other dishes were forgetable. There are many seafood restaurants serving chilli crab and this would barely make it on my list of repeat visit
4
We wanted to try chili crab so headed over to Jumbo just 10 minutes from the Marina Bay Sands. It was very crowded getting in with our reservation. After you check in make sure to push your way to the inside of the restaurant and show your ticket to a seater - you snooze you loose. The menu was extensive but we spent over $500 on two half lobsters. That was a little much. Will try other places next time
4
Their chilli crabs is very delicious and the paste is vey good to go with mantou(just like bread). The restaurant is always crowded but their service is fast. The restaurant is just right infront of the sea,is so relaxing when having dinner can feel the sea breeze

I know the chili crab is famous in Singapore but you must try the pepper crab at this place. It was truly satisfying! Perfectly cooked prior crab! Highly recommend this place and this dish.
3
Not the best places to go for seafood within the Jumbo Group. The food quality here is just so-so and it really caters for tourists rather than locals.
4
Sit outside, order some cold beer, watch the container ships float by and gorge yourself on ample portions of coconut shrimp, grilled prawns, and of course a messy order of chilli crab!
Kudos to whoever thought of the plastic gloves for breaking open crab!
5
A great place to have Singapore Crab. It felt it was a little on the expensive side but the service was efficient and the singapore Chilli Crab was worth every dollar. Either book or go early to avoid the long queue
4
Although there are restaurants at clarke quay local friends tell us this is the best one. It's a great feed and the crab is fantastic. We did find the wait staff tried to upsell a bit and will bring you a large portion unless you specify another size. But it's great
4
Settings at the place are kind of funny: terrace overlooking the sea, with what looks like a city afloat with all the massive cargo ships floating about. We had a very enjoyable dinner with delicious starters, tasty chili and black pepper crab and local desserts - top. The waitresses who dutifully served us through the evening were so efficient that I ended up having a feeling of having been busied through the program in order to empty the table for the next shift..
4
It was for a lunch meeting with an old friend. We ordered a fried fish with veggies and noodles. Fish was cooked to perfection, lovely and moist. We had asked for a spicy one and they delivered. The aloe lime drink was refreshing, noodles were OK, the veggie balanced the whole meal. Waitstaff were attentive and polit

They may serve a decent Pepper Crab, but that is about all Jumbo Seafood Centre has to offer. Despite having reserved a table, my companions and I had to wait in line for 30 minutes until given a table. After waiting for an additional 30 minutes our order was finally taken by a sour waitress. Another half and hour went before the first dish arrived. This did not look like the picture on the menu, and tasted like ready-to-eat fish nuggets. However, we remained in high hopes as we had heard great things of the pepper crab. This came after even more waiting. Though I will say that it tasted delicious, it was not good enough to weigh up for everything the things missing; napkins, plates and glasses. All in all Jumbo has decent food, but if you like your restaurant meals to be a overall good experience you should find some place else to eat
5
This is a must if you are in Singapore. Amazing sea food. Very busy so advise to book. We hadn't booked and advised wait of 40mins. However, we we're happy to share a table with 3 other diners and a got within 5 minutes. Recommend chilli live crab and Chinese Bread. Fantastic view over the river
4
Excellent location with good food . Chilly crab is really tasty . Fried scallops , mee goreng Malaysian style , prawn with cereals and vegetables . Do not forget deep fried bun, a must to better enjoy chilly crab .Good quality , good location, good food . I will come back to taste again other specialities 
4
Very good Singapore seafood restaurant. They serve famous Chili crab and black pepper crab with nice price. It's worth trying one time for yourself and your guest at least.
4
Was really nice food, and very busy but so over priced and over hyped. Best bit about it was the service from Kelly, she was amazing.
2
When I first started coming to Singapore used to go all the time. Lately not great and even the chili crab not great. Last time tried the fish. Would not recommend it
5
We had dinner here with friends who live in Singapore. A nice mix of locals and tourists. Good sea view, great sea food. Crab is what they serve and crab you should eat! Fresh and tasty!
5
We come here with every visit to Singapore. They cook really nice crab. Chilli Crab is what they are famous for, yet it is worth trying in other sauces as well. It goes well with Seafood Fried Rice, which is delicious on its own either. Service is not bad, but keep in mind that this place gets busy, so this may slow it down. But nonetheless we would definitely come back here next time in Singapore.
2
Be very careful what you have ordered and type of cooking and sauce. They first brought a wrong crab , then second one we suspected if it were a new one or old but re washed with the right sauce ... anyway manager came to explain us the situation. The bottom line ; bad start bad end .. we paid the whole bill eate nothing and left.
3
Overcrowded Tells me u have 1 hour 30 mins to eatAs a restaurant u forgotten why customers come as a family groupWe like the food but treasure family even more! Over charge for the crab! Go somewhere else! Try google any crab places in a HDB estateFar bette
4
Went here with local Singaporean colleagues to try chili crab for the first time, but ended up also trying the salted egg crab, and the black pepper crab as well. With good beer, a beautiful breeze from the sea, and a great atmosphere makes this place a great place for dinner, crabs and friends. Throw on some veggies and some rice and Tiger beer on the side and some fun friends and you've got yourself a great evening
4
Many people prefer the Chili crab but I find it a little sweet for my taste. I much prefer their awesome Black Pepper crab that always makes me crave for more. Don't forget to confirm the type of crab you would like (I always order the Sri Lankan crab - not a fan of the Canadian crab). Service is abrupt sometimes, but ok overall. Make sure you book otherwise you will be hungrily gazing at diners feasting on crab while you wait
5
By far, hands down the most amazing chili crab you will find in Singapore... we have tried other places but Jumbo Seafood never disappoints!!! Really tasty food and good ambience!! Must also mention that the waiters and waitresses are really helpful and taught us how to use chopsticks
5
I have tried chili crab which I think most of the tourists does.It is delicious and whenever I will return to Singapore for sure I will visit this restaurant again.
5
Delicious food to eat with family.The service was good and waitress so friendly and helpfull.A must eat here is the singapourean chilli crab cooked so well.loved it so much wish to go back again and again.
5
Excellent choice of food
Excellent service and better still the wonderful location
Would definitely go again when back in Singapore
5
What else to do but go to Jumbo for the best crab ever!!! The Chilli crab is super tasting and I also recommend the pepper crab. Don't forget bread buns to mop up the sauce!! Nothing else to say.
2
Now Jumbo is a listed company the corporate feel permeates its restaurants.The personality has gone and it has become like a food factory for not very discerning patrons.Black pepper crab with hardly any meat or taste is plonked down by a charmless waitress.Barely luke warm fried prawns are watery and also tasteless.Everyone seems hassled or grumpy.It is also noticeably expensive for what it has become.A sad shadow of its former self.Go elsewher
3
All tourists to Singapore must try chilli crab before leaving this little red dot. Jumbo is one of the best restaurant that caters to the local and tourists alike. This Jumbo restaurant has a very good location near the East Coast beach and ample parking space. Otherwise there is a taxi stand within 2 min walking distance. The chili crab and black pepper crab is a must try. Fried rice is good as well

여기 물 땅콩 이런거 다 돈을 따로 지불함 줄까요할때 무심코 에스하면 다 돈임.ㅋㅋ 코코넛과 칠리클랩 땅콩 그리고 따뜻한 녹차 마셨고 밥류 권해서 빵을 먹었는데 맛있고 작아서 한 개 시키기에는 양이 작음 마지막에 5센트 거스름돈 안줘서 헐 ㅋㅋ 외국인이다고 자연스럽게 돈 받고 가버림 ㅋ 달라해서 받았습니다ㅋ I didn't receive the discharge,5cent. I asked for the discharge to manager. The chili crab tastes good, but service was poor
5
East Coast is a very nice place to have great view of ships harbored and also flights heading towards Changi Airport one after another. In the evening at first view one has a chance to recognize floating ships with their lights as a small city. The whole atmosphere is awesome specially when to have sea foods at Jumbo. We went there as a part of business trip with some colleagues. Jumbo seafood is well known for the crab dishes and we were not disappointed. The outlet is just by the sea with a great seaside view. The signature Chilli Crab along with the sweet buns to soak up the sauce is the main attraction here. I would recommend this for new comers. The service was prompt. Visited December 201

After many years I came back to this place remembering the crab-based dishes ... and still they are the outstanding part of the menu. I really could not stop eating crab ...But I have to say that also the rest of the menu we tried was provided and served with a high quality. The only things I have to admit is that I found the service a bit cold and "always in a hurry". Sometimes we we're missing something on the table and it took a while to get served. But anyhow is a "must go" place for me in Singapore.
4
quick service, yummy food :) definitely must go when in Singapore. There are also another Jumbo located at Clarke Quay and we never miss visiting every time we go to Singapore. the buns go well with the chili crab sauce and dont forget the baby squid
5
Amazing food.. strongly recommend to try their pepper crab and seafood friedrice. Best location and good service.
5
Highly recommended place to try fresh and tasty seafood. Chilly crub-must try. One advice, in the evening this place is very crowded, thus do your booking or come earlier, 18-18:30 is best time.
5
Great place for great seafood. Huge place but highly efficient and organized. The waitress are very kind and warm. The crab is top notch at reasonable price. Nothing beats devouring fresh and tasty crab while enjoying coast view in a drizzling night.
5
Jumbo serves good quality crabs, service is also great! Good place for casual, couple, family and business dining.
5
I visited Jumbo almost every time when I stay at Singapore. It's closed to the coast and quality is stable. Both black pepper and chili crab is good.
5
Cannot begin to describe how amazing the food was! every single dish had tons and tons of flavour!!!!
5
Everything we ordered was really nice! It ended with the best chili crab ever!! A little bit outside the city center but a quick Uber ride (or a 2 hr walk if you can take the heat - nice walk along the beach though to get there
4
We were invited here by our friends to try the Singapore signature crab....we wore bibs and got tucked into the most amazing seafood...prawns first then the Chilli crab and pepper crab. A very busy and popular seafood restaurant and worth the delicious meal......service was a little slow but food excellent
5
We stayed in Singapore for a few days on route to Australia, some friends who live in Singapore met us at Jumbos to eat as they love it.Wow what amazing food, and lots of it, all the food was fresh, and tasted great. The chilli crab is a must, you just need to dig in and get messy, it is worth it!!!.You'll need to get a cab out from the city but it's quite a cheap journey and we'll worth it.We overnighted on route home and went back for more great food.Superb
5
Visited the jumbo seafood's east coast sea food centre outlet for new year day lunch with family. We had a reservation but found that the place is not too crowded for lunch. Enjoyed the signatures Chilli crab and black pepper crab along with few other side orders. Jumbo seafood is well known for the crab dishes and we were not disappointed. Food tastes great. It is on the pricier side but the the staff is friendly and service is prompt. The outlet is right by the sea with a beautiful sea vie
4
Chili and black pepper crabs a must eat in Singapore! Crabs from Sri Lanka! Expensive but worth the experience. This was Jumbo at Clarke Quay.
5
the place is commercial but the seafood is quite good Especially prawns with chilly sauce is must to eat
4
The trip is incomplete without a visit to Jumbo. Singapore chilly crabs with baked bread or egg fried rice. Drunken prawns, fish in orange sauce.
And take home packs of chilly crab sauce mix, pepper crabs.
4
It's the place to soak in the atmospheres of tourists and locals. Make sure to make reservations first
4
The seafood standard is good. I always bring guests and clients to dine here. The Chilli and black pepper crabs are MUST eat dishes
5
When i used to live in Singapore we would go to Jumbo seafood as often as possible. It is an amazing experience and great quality food you cannot get anywhere else in the world. The Chilli Crab is a must. Along with the sweet buns to soak up the sauce. I would recommend this branch over the branch in Clarke Quay as it has more of an atmosphere and is where all of the locals go. The bibs and the mess is part of the experience. If you only have time for one meal in Singapore, this should be it. I also ordered salt and pepper prawns and baby kai lan in garlic sauce and both were fantastic
4
I love to go to Jumbo on Fridays after work, nothing like a pepper crab with a beer to finish the week.Consistency of the cuisine is great, they source good quality food. The Chinese dishes are great too.I always bring my foreign friends there when they visit us in Singapor
4
Though the locals may say that this place is very commercialised but then this is still a good place to come if you are not staying for too many nights in Singapore. Do come early to have a lovely sunset view before or during your dinner. This is the best time to catch good shots. The crabs are still good and if you have a big group you should try both the chilly and black pepper sauce.Refer to the pics for other items that are good and available
3
I had a dinner in Jumbo seafood restaurant. The variety of dishes is a lot. I ordered few dishes only for the dinner, due to i dinner with myself only. Overall, the food is good, especially I like the dessert there, but I forgotten about the name. Recommended restaurant in Singapore
5
This restaurant serves crab that i can tell one of the best 3 seafood restaurants i have ever had in my life. It took an hour to be on our table but honestly it worths the wait. The way we made the booking was mart on how we placed the request and got an automated call to our cell. So uniqu
4
Lovely view by the sea and was really amazed at how fast their food was served. Would strongly recommend their chili crabs, drunken prawns and spring onion venison. Booking is definitely recommended if you want to dine during peak periods.
5
If you like Singapore Chilli crab this is the place to go had to share a table with other people as it was packed but that was OK nice cold tiger beer with the crab we enjoyed it
2
The service attitude is very poor. Visit there many times, it became worse and worse. Maybe it became famous tourist spot and the food standard there dropped as well. I won't visit there anymore as a local
2
Really know how to eat seafood will not like Jumbo - too commercial in taste.More for expatriate.
Local and really seafood lover will find Jumbo food too commercial and common.
4
I often drop in here on the way to the airport for a quality quick feed of seafood. The selection of food is extensive and tastes superb. The location is pleasant with great seaside views.
5
With an apron, a heaping steaming serving of chili crabs, and freshly cooked mantous makes Jumbo the best seafood restaurant in Singapore. Located near the river, Jumbo brings dining to a whole new experience-lah!
4
Yes, the chili crab was great, although expensive. The service was indifferent,
and we felt rushed.
I ordered prawns with egg batter that I didn't really like (too eggy). suggested by our waiter who was rushing me.
Nice location on the river walk,though.
4
The Chilli Crabs at Jumbo never fail to satisfy! Quality of taste and texture are always maintained and this consistency is what impresses me! Not to mention that they score pretty well on the other dishes like Mee Goreng, Hong Kong Style Steamed Bamboo Clams, etc.The drawback would be the crowd but that must be expected from a place that serves up good food
4
If you are ordering crabs, go ala carte instead of set meal. The crabs are fresh and meaty for the former, though they are more ex. We tried chilli and steamed crabs, both are recommended. The chilli crabs are not overly spicy, and go well with fried mantou. The steamed ones taste great, parents and kids love them. Service is generally ok. Get discount ranging from 10-20% with Jumbo membership.Some items may not be available for lunch
5
Taste: Very well done dishes especially their popular chilli crab that cannot find any where else around our region since it even went oversea for their authentic taste!Presentation: Very affordable for the price tags and presented well similar to any other higher ends restaurant.Service: The service was prompt, staff are friendly and approachable.Overall:The food was perfect, good portions and speedy service which always makes for a better evening dining! :
5
Everytime we bring our overseas guests to Jumbo, they never fail to be impressed. Everything down from the service to food is simply amazing. We typically go to the Riverside Point branch and will go there again for our annually CNY dinner.
5
Jumbo's seafood is fantastic and lives up to its reputation. The food is beautifully prepared and presented and the service was friendly and efficient. The chilli crab was superb. Highly recommended
5
The seafood here is excellent and has the best chilli crab I have ever tasted.
Booking is recommended as this restaurant is always busy, although you may be lucky early in the evening
4
Though there are various locations across the city, this is a great place to sample that only Singapore chili crab but a multitude of other dishes.
The service is great the beer flows and the atmosphere is fun. Going in a big group is best.
4
Wonderful and delicious seafood served at Jumbo Restaurants. My family and I really enjoyed our dinner .
4
Went here with some business colleagues to have chilli crab and pepper crab food was delicious. I would highly recommend the pepper crab and bread rolls and also the drunken prawns. Wine was super expensive. All in all lovely food and atmosphere.
5
We ate Chilly Crab and pepper crab. It was a king size crab of around 1 kg each.The chilly crab was yummy!I recommend all sea food lovers to visit this Restaurant....they have restaurants at various locations but we have visited ECP and River side ones.Loved the food here..
3
This place has a great location right on the water, a lot of seating (make a reservation if you're going at peak time), and it's good for a group. But I did not find the food to be as flavorful as they claim. Maybe it's just me.
4
Had a great time , food and service were lovely as always . Only regret was that their BBQ was not functional so could not have the grilled fish that we had gone primarily for !! Love the Kung Pao chicken , grilled sea bass and fried rice .
4
This restaurant is still highly popular for those that like to get away from the city and catch the sea breeze and look at the multitude ships,moored off the East Coast,with their lights twinkling on the sea.It is NOT a restaurant for a romantic night however as too big and noisy for gazing into the eyes of your loved one and whispering sweet nothings. The quality of the food is good and the service is very efficient. Do make sure you book in advance as you could be waiting a long time if you attempt a 'walk in'. Try the signature Chilli crab which is excellent(ask for a crab with roe,which seems to taste rather yummy when cooked in chilli). The pepper crab is also pleasant and of course the drunken prawns(prawns immersed in chinese wine for a while,which allegedly gets them tipsy,before being cooked). The East coast Seafood centre is about a 20 min taxi ride from Orchard Rd,shorts and T shirts are de rigeur and there are normally plenty of taxis to take you home again. Wortha visit if you want to get away from the concrete
5
Staff is great and really manage the busy time. They followed the the standards on the tables and on the service. We definitely we revisit again. Thanks.
4
The fresh sea food. The crab was to die for. We went for a great evening with friends and it was just make more remarkable with such great food... if you are a sea food lover then this place is highly recommended...
3
I think when you first visit SG you really should try it. Singapore famous for there chili crab so I feel it's a must. But after 3-4 times it wears off real quickly but for sure try it
5
We went here for Singapore crab!!! It was gorgeous. It's very messy so they give you a bib type affair to protect your clothes. 😀. Loved the restaurant. Would highly recommend.
5
Jumbo Seafood is the best place to eat chili crabs in Singapore. The East Cost branch is great, overseeing the beach but the branch on Dempsey Hill is good too and a bit more organized. There you can sit inside if the weather is too hot. The food is delicious. The service is less of a highlight. Make sure you bring your own wet tissues to clean your hands after the chili crab because you get "one" piece from them and it's never enough. No napkins. It is very popular. Book a table as it gets really busy. The East Cost branch is supper casual. Good for shorts and flip flops even at dinner time.
2
Over rated, expensive and not good food. It has a reputation as the best on Clark quays but my husband had a crab and for the price it was hunt the crab meat. I'm Gluten free and had a very poor menu offered me with some distaste by the waiter. Food was nearly cold and tasteless . Wouldn't advise visiting
4
It is not "wow" but it is consistently good in terms of both service and food standards. Of course, everyone flocks here for the seafood but there are lots of other dishes on the menu (including vegetarian) for those who don't eat seafood.You can ask for bibs and gloves if you really are getting stuck into the chilli or pepper crab - crab sizes are about 800 grams and would be suitable for 2-3 people depending on how much you want to eat. If just trying, then one crab has about 6 pieces once cooked.The outdoor dining (alfresco) is great and you can see both the water and the stars... really nice on a breezy evening and much better than being inside in the aircon! Service is attentive enough with enough waitstaff around to easily flag attention and you are likely to see both tourists and locals (some locals entertaining clients) here on any given night. For weekends, don't forget to make a reservation online or on the phone as it does get busy.Prepare to pay from $60/pp if you are picking seafood and having a few beers
4
This place is heaven for sea food lovers. The Prawns and Lobsters are to die for. The only place which I feel gives it competition is Seafood Market, Bangkok. Iam not comparing the two. I have eaten here number of times and still cant get enough of it
4
Jumbo has continued to expand in Singapore. Consistency is always assured. The crab, prawn and bamboo clams are great - the only comment is it always feels so efficient given the rate of table turn over - but hey the food is great especially if you are entertaining friends from out of town or catering for a large team celebration
4
Chili Crab was on our "to do" list for Singapore and Jumbo was recommended to us by our concierge.Jumbo has a number of venues but I understand this one is their founding restaurant.It's huge! For such a large venue, delivering good service could be a challenge, but Jumbo's great organisational skills meant that service was excellent. We were seated quickly, drinks order taken quickly, and our food was served timely.We took some tips from a friend (Jason) on what to order and choose two crabs as well as sides and found it way too much! (How much did you think we can eat Jason??)The chili crab sauce is amazing, make sure you get the buns with it (same menu page as the crabs) to soak up the sauce.We also ordered the pepper crab as our friend told us the chili sauce is so overpowering you can't taste the crab. However I found the pepper was pretty strong too and two crabs too much for two people.I recommend a crab between two-three people, and maybe a side dish.It's messy (make sure to grab a bib!) and head for the hand washing station after.Although a great experience, our taxi driver (local) and a friend who saw our post on FB, both recommended a place in Geylang as an alternative.A crab was $65 and our whole meal of two crabs and three side dishes totalled $215 (no alcohol
5
Quality can still be maintained over the years and with so many branches. Black pepper crab and Chili Crabs are must have.
5
I've been wanting to try this forever, and certainly was not disappointed! My host ordered the crispy buns to soak up the delicious sauce! Outstandingly scrumptious! We also had Broccoli and Spicy Scallops as well as the Pumpkin Prawns- highly recommend all three!
4
Told it was a must try Chilli Crab and was not disappointed. It was delicious. Price for 900gms was SGD70 + not cheap but good for a splurge. Pretty busy but quick turnover.
3
The food are the same old same old except the the portion seems smaller. The signature chilli crab is still the highlight for foreigners. But the size of the crabs has reduced and the wow effect is gone. Have to think of some place else to bring visitors.The steam Soonhock is fresh but again too small in size for a party of six. May need to go for cheaper seabass to get a larger fish. Overall the experience is average despite its fame
4
They have good food. Their specialty is the crab with sweet spicy sauce. Anyway, I'm more impressed with the taste of the shrimp with cereals and the fried baby squid. They are great! If you want to relax and have you time to enjoy your dinner, then this place is not the place. When we went there the last time, they timed us. We got only hours time to order and to finish our food. Because it's always very busy. The place is also very noisy. So you can't talk normally to each other
5
Jumbo is a great seafood restaurant in Singapore. When i first traveled to Singapore years ago the locals told me this is the place for spicy crab. They also give you bread to dip in the spicy crab sauce. Very extensive list of seafood to choose from if you are not interested in the crab. Nice views and a great outdoor seating area
5
Brought our Japanese friend here to enjoy some great seafood. Had the broccoli with scallop, bamboo clam, chilli crab, salted egg prawn and sharksfin soup. Definitely a hit with our friend who thoroughly enjoyed tasting our Singapore style dishes. As we were there early for dinner and the sun had not yet set, we decided to have our dinner at level 2 in air conditioned comfort instead of al fresco.
4
This is the second time I visited this seafood restaurant. Been here a few years ago and I found the service was bad last time. This time we return I find the service has improved a lot, food was good.We had both chilli crab and pepper crab, satays and a dish of stir fried vegetables.Food arrived promptly and we sat right next to the seaside (at the alfresco).A very comfortable meal, the crab was exactly what I expected.
5
The only dish i wanted to eat during my stay was chilli crab, the locals recommended Jumbos and it was obviously popular with the lines of people they were attracting! Food was amazing and prices were reasonable considering the price charged by other restaurants around. Crab was $78/Kg so the whole meal was about $100
5
Wonderful selection of fresh seafood with a stunning view of the strait with all the ships passing through or anchored and lit up for the night. I don't care for the mess of chili crabs but the flavor is perfect. Recommend the pepper crab or garlic prawns or the fresh fish. A Singapore must d
5
A place to enjoy very tasty and frehs seafood. Especially the Chili crab is definitely my favored dish at Jumbo´s. It´s located next to the shore.
4
We waited 45 mins for a table. But it was totally worth the wait.
I had really high standards and you know what? I'll wait 45mins every time.
Amazing food and there's so many options. Food is fresh and the place is always packed out.
4
This is favorite restaurant when we host overseas guest. The rolls of fish tank with live swimming fishes, lobsters and seafood never fails to fascinate them. Local favorites such as chili crab and mee goreng are consistent. Private rooms are available for corporate hosting.
5
Famous for their chili crab, they also offer other crab preparations. We ordered 5 different dishes and not one disappointed. We ate outdoors in the warm evening. Perfect!!!
5
The Chili Crab is very delicious! It is not so hot, but tasty. I like it very much! I also had Chili Crab in China Town, but it is more sweety, not as good as Jumbo.
4
A hot humid Saturday night, a crowd of locals packed into this mostly open air arena with a menu that never changes. Nearly efficient service. The lights of the ships anchored out in the Strait twinkle through the humidity. Some things never change. The whole crabs are a mess but worth the effort. We decided that the pepper crab was the better of the chilli crab. Surprisingly there was no wait at the taxi rank, although the night was dry. A timeless experience
5
The chili Crabs are amazing. Very delicious.The restaurant is full at dinner time. Make sure to make reservation.The crabs are excellent and delicious. However, the crabs here have very thick and hard shell. It is not easy to work with. However, it worth your effort
5
My hotel said Jumbo was the place to go for chili crab. While I'm no crab connoisseur I really enjoyed it and the outdoor cafe atmosphere.I saw some garlic shrimp passing by that almost convinced me to order a second entree.Definitely reserve in advance
5
Never mind you have to wear a paper napkin - the seafood is just great, and with a stunning view of the water with all the ships at anchor. Try the drunken prawns (imagine to die in a sea of brandy...) and the Chili or Pepper Crabs. The variety is endles
5
Awesome crab (and food!). Over the years numerous competitors have appeared, but Jumbo remains the King of Seafood on ECP and Singapore! It's not a cheap meal, but worth every dollar! Try the crab and the veggies and the noodles! You will not regret a visit to Jumbo! It never disappoints!
5
It's located in the Central Business District along the beautiful Historic Singapore River in Singapore and here we had Seafood Superior Soup with Crab Meat, Bamboo Pith and Corn, Chilli Crab and Fried Rice with Seafood really the food was very tasty and yummy.
5
was tipped by my uber driver that this was the best spot for sweet chili crab and they were absolutely correct. food here is great and service is just as good.It is a popular spot though and probablybest to make reservations if they take them
4
There are several seafood restaurants in this area, and Jumbo Seafood seems to be the best (or the one with the most people/queues!). The chilli crab is the star dish, not too spicy but enough flavour for you to lick your fingers afterwards and use the buns to mop up the sauce. Their prawns are also fresh. We also had the dancing fish - fried fish carved to stand upright, with another chili based sauce, and clams - all recommended. We also tried their roast chicken - very ordinary, not recommended. Stick with the seafood! Well worth the trip out from town
4
This restaurant is renowned for its chilli crab and was recommended to us by friends and by the butler at our hotel. It was the first time we had ever tried chilli crab and it was a great experience! I didn't realise how messy it would be as a lot of sauce came with the crab! An experience not to be missed whilst in Singapore!
4
The food here is excellent - especially the crab. We tried the chilli crab and the pepper crab, both were excellent. Also the bamboo clams - delish! The wasabi prawns were a disappointment, you can skip that. Great setting on the water. But beware that this is not a cheap meal, it adds up very quickly. Hardly a fancy "fine dining" restaurant, but its prices are
5
We just had one of the best Chilli Crabs ever, straight out of the tank, and the sauce on the fish ..... Try and buy some. Good staff and a really energetic setting. I cannot wait to get back there next time I an in Singapor
3
We ate at the Dempsey hill restaurant, an interesting location and worthy of a walk around.We had the staple chili crab (ok), drunken prawns (good) and a few other dishes that were ok. All in all - our expectations probably were to high....When booking, insist on indoor seating
4
We ate here several times on our last visit and we are still thrilled with the food. We eat here every time we come to Singapore and even had our family reunion come new year's eve party here on our first visit. The chillicrab is absolutely delicious and we also love the steamed seabass with black bean sauce and kankong belacan. This restaurant is suitable for parties of all sizes, but I would recommend booking table ahead of time for larger parties and visits during the weekend, as the place is packed every weekend
4
Ok, this was good food. I had the chili crab and it was tasty. HOWEVER.....they serve it all in a big pot, and what a horrible mess! Plastic gloves and a lobster bib is a must for this place. My advice to Jumbo: Serve the chili and crab in separate dishes!!!!! Yes, the crab is good, yes the chili is good...I could just dip the crab in the chili...but NOOOO they have to serve it all in a big pot and force you to slop your hands in the chili. Totally unnecessary, but I guess that's their business model. ok, rant over. Go ahead and go to this restaurant, but beware of the mess

I love to eat seafood and more so, at Jumbo Seafood. I have near 30 years of experience eating at Jumbo. While it is a good sign that the company has become very big with outlets at multiple locations, it is still very hard to make a reservation due to overwhelming demand. It's pricing has been escalating and it popularity remains. I suggest the management to open many more branches in Singapore while ensuring good consistent quality...

Delicous food to eat with family,friends,soul mate. The service is good the waitress so friendly n helpfull. Good place nearest with hang out place. After eat u can take a good picture arround. The most important is... friendly prices :)
5
Nothing can compare to Jumbo's Chili Crabs. It still the best one I have ever tasted. And only on this trip did i learn that dipping fried buns on that chili sauce is an out of this world experience.
5
Although this restaurant is a bit pricey the Chili crabs and deep fried buns are amazing.This venue appears to be more casual than the restaurant in the city (Riverside Point) but the food is consistently mouthwatering whichever venue you go to.
5
A visit to Jumbo Crabs is like a pilgrimage for all seafood lovers!Although the chili crab is the most popular, my family and I personally prefer the black pepper crab.However, we order the gravy of the chili crab as it goes best with the man-tau or fried buns
3
While our exchange rate hasnt helped, the prices here have risen dramatically and I noticed that many tourists and families now seems to be staying away. Instead the restaurant seemed to be full of business people schmoozing their clients and guests.Beware that tax and the tip will add another 30% to your bill. Having a crab and a rice and a pitcher of beer, the bill came to $140.We will probably look for somewhere new to eat after touchdown in Singapore for next time, thats a shame as we do enjoy the ambiance here on the waters edge
4
Booking is advisable. The place is packed, and customers just keep coming in.Chilli crab is good, flesh is juicy and fresh. Sauce can be better though. The tofu with mushroom is good, recommended by the lady who served us. Service was slow, had to wait a while for the rice after the dishes came out
5
I was craving for some chilli crab and the fist one that came to mind was Jumbo. It was a Saturday night and it was crowded as expected. We got our table within a short time as we were early. All the food was good as was the service. Especially the chilli crab. I have never been disappointed with their chilli crab. It's been a while since we ate there, writing this makes me want to go back again! I can't say more except to say : "Ill be back!
4
Good food all round - Singapore seafood staples so always a danger of it being a tourist trap but pretty good overall.Service was a bit slow at times but all staff were friendly.Views out to sea are impressive and help set the scene.Good transport links mean it's popular although reservations weren't needed for some of the people dining next to u
4
The food was lovely and prices relative to what you would pay elsewhere. Lovely inside in the air conditioning!Only criticism was the peanuts and tea we had to pay for ( and didn't ask for!) and the over fussy service of the waitress fussing around rearranging the teapot every five minutes
4
It was very busy when we visited. And had to wait approximately 20 mins for a table. An excellent waiting system is operated by the restaurant, whereby they send you a text when your table is ready (compatible with international numbers). The food was good, fresh and flavorsome. The obvious choice would be the chili crab but do also try the pepper crab
5
Food is good and great atmosphere. However, be prepared to pay the bill. Crab over there are expensive but they are really good if you don't mind to pay for it.
3
Food is good but be prepared to pay the price. Seafood is generally expensive and may cost $60 to $80 per pax depending on the type of seafood ordered
4
Authentic chili crab can be eaten here. It is not fancy, but a bit rustic in the center of life in Clark's Quay. Super fresh seafood and beautiful view. Whine list should be improved though.
4
Black pepper crab is a true blue Singaporean dish and this place serves up a decent version of that. Also their lamb chops are pretty good too. A nice place for dinner with family and friends.
5
We had family visiting so took them to experience this quintessential Singaporean dinner. Its always crowed so you must book. I enjoy the peanuts with chilli sauce as we reach. The chilli or pepper crab (the signature dishes) are a must. You have to use the bib they give you to eat this, as well as the shell crunchers and forks to scoop out the flesh. If your hands don't get messy, you have not done justice to the meal. The venison, chicken in chilli sauce, garlic prawns, egg fried rice, fresh coconut are our favourites. Plus the kids like noodles with chicken and prawns (and yes, NO vegetables)!The wet paper towels you get (may need to pay for them depending on how much you order) are worth it to keep tidy during what inevitably is a 1-2 hour long meal. If you can't use chopsticks, cutlery is available.Try practising with chopsticks. Eating out of the small bowls (instead of plates) helps. After eating you can wash up.And after paying you can take a stroll on the beach. The kids would love it.What can be better given the international clientele: have staff who understand basic English. Many of them don't. Then you need to go to the more senior staff to explain what you want. Also, the Chinese style seems to be to eat each dish on its own. However, many visitors want (for example), to eat the chicken with the rice. This needs to be taken into account as there are long gaps
2
The crabs priced here at around S$100 per piece which is definitely much much higher than elsewhere. In terms of quality, it is deemed acceptable for the price that one is paying for. Should one decide to patronize, I strongly suggest making prior reservations as it is usually packed with people during mealtimes
5
Large outdoor restaurant, filled with many many customers. There is a reason why their chili crab is award-winning. It is really amazing. Large succulent crab in a spicy sweet souls with an undertone of peanuts. The bread buns have a very nice sweet crunchy crust. Service is fast but English leaves to be desired. The scallops and shrimp in cereal were OK but nothing special. Go for the crab
5
There is nowhere tat you could have the yummiest chilli crab other than jumbo. There are probably other more neighbpurhood places that serve pretty good stuff too but Jumbo had kept their standards pretty consistent over the years even wen they had expanded to so many outlets . Pricing is reasonable and crabs are so juicy. Awesome food!
5
The food here is unbelievable, everytime i come to singapore it's a must to eat here. The service is great food isgreat although the queue could take forever, you have to book several hours earlier. A must eat here is the singaporean chili crab coocked woth alaskan crab. The price is i guess reasonable but i think it goes under the category of expensive. But all in all it's a definite must tr
4
This place is only for sea food lovers. They specialize in Singaporean chilli crabs. The crabs are fresh and are imported daily from sri Lanka. The wine collection along is elaborate . jumbo crab has a lot of outlets in Singapore. Overall dinning experience was amazing. Very tasty crabs.
5
Excellent food ,just mesmerizing entertainment and exclusive and excellent services, tend to over eat due excellent preparation and preparation of crabs. Loved it so much wish to go back again again 😊😊😊😊😊👌🙏😄😄😄😄😄
4
Great crab in this clean restaurant. It's not cheap but you can't be in Singapore and not do chilli crab! Enjoyed this immensely but expect to pay around $200 for 2 people and you won't be disappointed.
5
I am not boasting about this place but the feng shui is just somewhat amazing being the most crowded daily but yet the furthest restaurant in the cluster of restaurants in that area. I can only attribute it to its good food and friendly staff.
4
The taste of Chilli crab still as good as expected but the rest of 2 dishes- average. Good service even the restaurant was full.
5
There are many seafood restaurant in Singapore. So I don't dare say that one serves better seafood than the other as many restaurants dedicate their specialisation for one signature dish. But Jumbo is an all-rounder, serving very good seafood dishes all acroos the board. Of course, we came here for the crabs and we had 3 kinds: Chilli, black pepper and salted egg yolk.The flavours are adequately well done unlike some that seems to think that the flavours only relate to colours only. The crabs they serve here are consistently meaty, enough to satisfy the many crab-lovers we have on this island. Environment-wise it is comforable. To truly appreciate the seafood dishes, always try to get an al-fresco dining where u get to see the sea and enjoy whatever breeze there is. There is an air-conditioned dining area in the loft, but really that's only for tourists, last-minute bookings and diners who just abhor the heat. When the dinner starts, things will start to get hectic, though not mad enough that the serving staff ignore you. Don't expect top-notch service with a smile from the middle-aged servers but that doesn't mean they will not try to meet your needs. It's the problem of getting their attention that can get a bit put-off. Other than that, the staff really works like a well-oiled seafood churning machine.Book early (around 1 week early) to avoid disappointment - both in the carpark and the restaurant seating. Tip: Come later after 8.30 if you cannot reserve a table in time
5
Had lunch at Jumbo Seafood and enjoyed the famed Chili Crab - this lived up to everything that has been written about it. We also had the duck salad that was very refreshing and the ribeye and venison meals - all were excellent. Service was great and make sure you wear a bib - you will get it everywhere
4
This is a review for the Jumbo at Riverwalk. We booked quite late so would consider ourselves fortunate that we managed to get a table for dinner (albeit at 5.30pm) but felt ridiculously rushed as we were advised we had to leave by 6.45pm (sounded sufficient at the time but our last dish being the chilli crab didn't arrive until after 6pm). The food is really really good - the signature chilli crab is worth every cent especially if you soak up the sauce with the steamed buns, or in our case, with the seafood fried rice. You do pay for it though and it's not cheap. I just wished the ambience would match the prices as I felt like I was paying 5-star prices for a market / hawker stallsetting. We had to ask them to replace the cups and bowls as they were all filthy and had stains/grease on the inside - some actually still had food stuck on the outside of it! The toilets are pretty disgusting as well. I wouldn't care so much if it was a hawker stall and a $40 meal but for one of the most popular and famous restaurants in Singapore where I just paid $500 for our meal, I definitely expect a lot better
4
Get your Chillie crab fix here at Jumbos.. Lovely cool breezy setting at East Coast Parkway. Reservations a must if you don't want to queue. Lots of other dishes on the menu for the non crab lovers. Expect to around the $70 a kilo mark for the crab, with 800 gram the smallest serve available
4
The cooking at Jumbo Seafood is consistently good irrespective of the outlet you visit. While prices are not cheap you can sometimes get heftily discounted meals at the SAFRA outlet in Changi through Groupon. The venue is not easily accessible though and you would need to take a cab if you don't drive
5
We came here specifically to eat Singapore Chilli Crab and were not disappointed at all.When we first arrived, it looked a bit "barn like" which to be honest did put me off initially, and I was expecting the flavours to be bland and prepared for "satisfying the masses". It is huge and there's big tables everywhere and quite loud. However the location on the water added to the atmosphere of eating seafood.We ordered a number of dishes including the Chilli Crab, Kang Kung (Morning Glory), Gai Lan, Sweet and Sour Pork (one if the best I've eaten with crispy not soggy batter!), Crispy Chicken and of course loads of beer.We went with another family of friends and after dinner, all of our (7) kids could play safely on the grassed area between the restaurant and the water while we finished our meal
3
Huge restaurant. Good place to grab a messy meal with the family or friends. Quick, easy and completely informal. It is a much loved restaurant in Singapore.
4
High expectations so was not surprised to have to join the waiting list upon arrival. Service was friendly and efficient but not outstanding. Food was very good - as advertised and expected given the cost. This is a must if you love seafood.
4
This place is at the coastline on the way to the airport. I normally go there on my way to the airport. This place is not fancy. You sit on simple chairs on a covered terrace outside. But you get good seafood Chinese style. All the evenings I was there it was pretty full. I was really astonished how my Chinese colleagues used the chop stick to eat the (not peeled) jumbo prawns and the pepper crab. I preferred to just use my hands ;-
4
We have a table of twelve having dinner in this restaurant n found the food plus the environment is nice. Not very crowded we been there by taxi.We ordered pawn, chili n pepper crab which are good. We also order so dishes which the serve very fast n good customer service.It is fair to have a very full meal with each person spent about 80SGD. Your can walk along the nearby park for the good view of the night view along this seashore park
3
We love eating crabs.Had dinner at Jumbo and a nearby restaurant on separate occasions. All of us agreed the food and service were better at the other one. The bun size was truly mini here and nowhere near jumbo. Needless to say, we enjoyed both the buns and the crabs a little less here.Having said that, most first time visitors would have no basis for comparison and would not miss a thing
4
In the long beach sea soher , First of you like the deep calling of the sea...... and the sweet wheather in your face. Then once U feel you are hungry and the RED line calling you Jumbo sea food. very nice , testy and cordial service
4
We went to this Jumbo because the one at Dempsey Hill was fully booked. We were not disappointed, equally good.The food was uniformly excellent, including the black pepper crab. Service was good. Nice view of the ocean.It's a very large restaurant, so not great if you are looking to avoid crowds, but it doesn't affect the food quality or service
4
It's been years since I last ate here, so when the opportunity arose recently, I didn't hesitate to join a group of colleagues and friends for a dinner gathering. The setting is lovely, especially in the evening, with ships berthed at anchor off-shore, a view of planes landing or taking off in the distance, and the occasional sea breeze wafting in. These all adds to a nice atmosphere with highly-anticipative diners generally attacking their food with gusto. This being a bit of a special occasion, there didn't appear to be a ceiling to our budget. So we made the most of it ordering as much as we could eat. Lobster salad, Alaskan crabs served three separate ways - in chilli sauce, salted egg mix, and with black pepper, hot plate oyster omelette, deep fried tillapia, and fried noodles all made for a terrific meal, all washed down with beverages and cold desserts. Now, I'm hoping it won't be so long till I go back again
5
There's a saying that if you do the sauce right, the main ingredients, particularly the meat will just follow. It couldn't be truer in Jumbo Seafood's case. Their sauces are what makes their dishes. Anybody can buy great ingredients, but it's how one melds them together to create something entirely new and unique that sets the best from the rest
3
They have several branch in Singapore one of them is in Dempsey road. We tried to have dinner at the one in East coast next to the water with fresh breeze from the sea. Chillicrab was good, steamed seabass was bland, other food was ok. Service was good and price is reasonable
4
Been there few times with colleagues and family as well. Enjoyed different dishes but Chilli Crab remains my favourite and the sauce is amazing with buns.
4
Great seafood restaurant ; famous for pepper crab, chilly crab, mee goreng , these are my favourites; other dishes include fried baby squids, vegetables etc
5
It was a dinner our for us, excellent ambiance, View (sea facing) and obviously the best chilli crab and seafood.
Loved it!
5
We tried famous chilli crab and on another day Black pepper crab a another seafood restaurant. Quite êxpensive at both restaurant but delicious.
However distance to the restaurant need taxi so be prepared to add the fares in when you visit.
5
Best Chili Crab I ever had. Looking forward to going back to enjoying the nice atmosphere and the yummy seafood 😋👍
5
Amazing food, crazy good service and the venue of the East Coast lovely on a balmy Singapore night.
We keep coming back - but I hear the centre will be moving to another part of the East coast. Hope it will be even better.
4
This is a very lively, open place with very fresh seafood....as in, it's live in the tanks! This is something of a downer though, as you see groups of very sad looking fish huddled together in a cramped space awaiting execution- more can be done to improve the conditions of the animals.Food-wise, it is great. I recommend the black pepper chillie crab as the regular chillie crab is a bit sweet and smothered in sauce- but if that's what you like, you'll certainly enjoy it
5
Special thanks again to Jackie service wonderfull ,We had a booking of 6 service was terrific ,it was a first for 4 of us and it delivered a seafood feast to die food for the Chilli Crab unbelievable ,washed down with a cold tiger beer. We will be back
4
Visited there for dinner. There were a collection of huge seafood restaurants in the area, but our friend recommended Jumbo so we headed in and not disappointed. Our favorite dish were chili crab and bamboo shells which were very tasty. The chili crab was very fresh, and reminds us of a restaurant in HK. Highly recommended
4
Jumbo is famed for seafood. But seafood in Singapore is expensive, even though we are an island surrounded by the sea.Most of the good quality big sized seafood ingredients are imported. Try the chilli crab. Then dip buns into the gravy after the crab has been cracked and devoured.Use your hands. Get it deep and dirty. Steamed prawns are also exceptionally sweet here. Other shellfish are also available.Remember that seafood that costs by-weight must be checked first for final price otherwise they may choose the heaviest fella and your wallet will end up lighter.Damages should run in the hundreds for a decent meal. So if you're a budget backpack visitor, try eating somewhere else
4
Super place for all varieties of Crab ..Pepper Crab and Singapore Chili Crab is delicious. the Prawn Dishes are also very fresh. Ambience and service is not great but food is excellent
5
got best saefood helped by tripadvisor, the fish grilled with french fried and cereal fried prawns were fantastic ,helpfull staff and very nice here in jumbo seafood. would recommend strong.
5
If you want to try Singapore's award winning chillie crab anf their signature black crab, this is the place to try it!
Value for money, great ambiance!
4
Good cereal fried prawns and nice chilli crab. Very good ambience by the river! Staff very nice and cooperative! Would advise making a reservation as the place gets very crowded fast!
5
We couldn't get a table indoors because we didn't have a reservation but we were only too happy to get a table outdoors if only to sample their famous chili crabs. We were not disappointed. I was initially afraid that the crabs might be too spicy for me but they were only mildly spicy so that worked out well for me. We ordered other dishes as well because my brother is not fond of seafood or spicy food and all the dishes turned out to be delicious. We went for lunch but it was still quite pleasant outdoors despite the heat and humidity. There is enough shade and maybe, we were lucky. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to try chili crabs
4
It's a icon seafood restaurant in Singapore. Crab is really tasty as are the other dishes but the pricing is ridiculous. Service super fast and always a queue to get it but the price is a turn off. Ok for treating a visitor to Singapore [once] but not as a regular place to eat
3
We ordered 2 main dishes only like a piece of crab cooked in spicy sweet sauce and scallops and we paid almost 145 singaporean dollars. Not all of their waitress can speak in english, most in mandarin so we did not understood that they also charged for hot tea, peanuts and wet towels
4
Finally, we were able to dine in Jumbo Seafood after giving up a month ago due to the long queue. We ordered Chilli Crab, being one of their bestsellers, and stir fried venison (with spring onion and ginger). These were paired with buns (bread) both steamed and fried (though the steamed variety seemed to taste better). The verdict:The chilli crab lived up to the hype. Delicious thick sauce based on tomato and chili makes it difficult for you to stop eating and in fact using the buns to scoop it up as a dipping sauce.The venison is a welcome "balancer" to the rich taste of the crab. Meat is thinly sliced and very soft; the ginger-based sauce adds zest to it, together with the spring onions. It was a good thing the food was exceptional. Because the service can be improved significantly.
4
Not only are they famous for their chili crab, but their pepper crab is a must try too! We got a table on the water-side, and for three person we ordered one pepper crab, 3 bamboo clams, deep fried buns (that came with free chili crab gravy), salted egg prawns, deep fried baby squid and some veg. Was brilliant meal and can't complain with the price! Tiger beer served cold and recommend sitting outdoors! Don't worry if it rains, the staff are attentive with moving everyone inside, even in slight drizzle, but we decided to stay outside
4
This place is very crowded even on a Sunday night! Lucky i managed to call in to book a table prior to coming otherwise not sure how long would I be queuing for. When you dial in, they will ask if you want to sit in the aircon room (upstairs), or outdoors (level 1). When you arrive, go to the counter first to check your reservation (there will be a lady there manning the counter with telephones) and she will write down your details and pass a slip of paper to you. If you opted for level 1 dining, you have to queue up. If you opted for aircon dining, simply wait for her to tell you before you make your way upstairs. They have an orderly system which i liked! Beware though, upstairs is pretty chilly! They have strong aircon blasts. Food wise, the usual chilli crabs with mantou was delicious! The fried rice and yam paste dessert too!
5
The restaurant is very big and very popular in Singapore...a little bit crowded but the crab is really amazing!
4
Chilly crab was very good. Restaurant is very crowded in the weekends, it is better to book in advance. Price are expensive
3
I went to Jumbo when it was much smaller many years ago. The chili crab was spicier then and less sweet, or so it felt. I was disappointed in it this time round, but the lime juice is still good.
5
I have been to Jumbo's a few times when travelling to Singapore for business. The Singapore Chilli crab was lovely but the Black Pepper Crab is to die for. Amazing lip smacking flavour. Looking forward to another visit soon.
4
Authentic and awesome place for Chili Crab in Singapore.
Ambience were great and the area huge enough to cater such a big crowd regardless family/business purpose.
Price were reasonable and the staff were friendly.
5
My family dine quite often at the restaurant as we all like the chilli crabs very much . The food is nice especially chilli crabs and the fried buns.
4
The chilly crab is the representative food in Singapore. The Jumbo Seafood is very popular chain restaurant in Singapore. I went that one in Clarke Quay. The restaurant is on the river side and very nice view in the night. We ordered one chilly crab and one dish of fried rice. It is about 80$ for one person. To be honest, it is quite expensive, but seafood is high price in Singapore. The food is just at average level. You can try once but donâ€™t expect too much
4
My friend who is a local brought me here two years ago and I had been dreaming about the chilli crab since then! So, on my recent trip to Singapore we had to come back again. The chilli crab is amazing and those little buns that you use to lap up the chilli sauce are just perfect.
2
We usually visited Red House to have seafood on the East Coast. It was right on the beach and we enjoyed the food with views and sea breezes. It was closed recently so we tried the one next door: Jumbo Seafood. We did not like it because: 1. The quality of the crab is not as good; 2. The taste is nothing to write home about; and 3. The price is higher
4
We dine quite regularly at the restaurant because the food is pretty consistently good (not fine cuisine, but definitely good comfort food), and the restaurant is big enough to accommodate slightly larger groups without too much difficulty to get tables. However, as for their service, I think it can be improved. They are generally efficient. But because they are (probably) understaffed, it is often difficult to get additional help once the food has been served
4
ordered crabs very messy to eat but the gals workin there they actually deshell the crabs so that you can enjoy eating without messing your clothes.
3
Used to love it much. Last week dining was not as good experience as it used to.
Taste was average, seating was not good.
Got a seat in semi-outdoor, the wind was too much make us all feel bit ill.
4
A must do for all sea food lovers the pepper crab is highly recommended the staff is good and place is well located all in all a good one:)
5
Absolutely loved it. Relatives took us here and recommended the Pepper Crab. They said a lot about it and the seafood dish did end up living to its hype. Amazing.
5
I have been eating here for a few years and it is still a great place for Chilli crab. Order the Chilli crab with fried bread, crispy baby squid, and Pepper crab. Call ahead and reserve as they are always full. Locals say that this is the best branch to eat at
2
This place has consistently let me down. The location is great (seafood by the sea) but the quality of food is wanting. Not only quality of food disappointing but the pace the food is served is also a killer-- long waits between dishes makes poor eating. Yes, it is packed with both locals and tourists. But the last three meals I hosted left much to be desired. So I really don't get the appeal of the place.Deciding I never want to be feel grumpy over a meal, I shall not return as a host and hope I don't get invited as a guest
5
“One of the reasons I really like jumbos is also because you can get the cereal prawns deshelled.”we were there on a Tuesday night and even then there were 2 people waiting for a table when we arrived. We only had a couple of mins to wait as a table was cleared, so the message is try booking or get there early or you’re probably going to have to wait.One of the fun things about these kind of restaurants is trying to figure out who does what. There clearly is a hierarchy and each person has their job and that’s all they are allowed to do. So there can be a bunch of staff next to you but none of whom can take an order. Our experience of this was when our friend tried to order a bottle of wine from the lady serving the tea. Folks who have been here a while will be used to this and look for the person with the earpiece or different coloured shirt so it’s more fun than annoying.We went for the black pepper crab, we prefer this to chilli crab and this one was good and spicy. I always like breaking open the shell and getting all messy. The bib provided was definitely needed, the only problem being that it kept blowing up, the ladies didn’t seem to have this problem.The service staff is anything but pleasant, and to add to it you have a cart with a dirty blue bucket moving around the restaurant, collecting used crockery
5
Our son in law who visits Singapore regularly kindly treated us to dinner while we were spending 4 days there. We had mentioned we had wanted to try Chilli Crab and he advised us the only place to go was Jumbo Seafood. When we spoke to the hotel they also recommended Jumbo's.We ate at the Clarke Quay and it was delicious. I have only very had Chilli Crab on 2 other occasions in Australia but this one in Singapore was just so good. Truly amazing and very enjoyable. Can't comment on other Chilli Crab in Singapore but the dish at Jumbo's was very impressive
1
My wife and I arrived in Singapore from Thailand on the next leg of our 3 week honeymoon around South East Asia. As a huge seafood fan, my wife had arranged to stop at Jumbo Seafood for diner straight from the airport to try their famous chilli crab.I can honestly say this is the worst dining experience of my life and a terrible first impression of Singapore. The service was abysmal and the staff were rude. We waited over an hour for a dish which never came and was eventually cancelled. When we asked for the bill, it was thrown on the table without a hint of apology. This is a stark contrast to the outstanding customer service we received in Thailand.Do not come here. The waiting staff are detestable and the food is vastly overpriced
4
Walked over from Clarke quay and found this seafood heaven and of course we had 2 types of prawns - in pumpkin purée and other in steamed garlic.Attentive staff and great food in terms of quality and portion side but if you drink wine drink before coming as like with most of Singapore wine list prices are high... Well worth the value and on to river cruise to Marina Bay..
4
One of the more well known seafood restaurants in Singapore offering the famous chili crabs, this location offers a nice seaside ambience. Slightly pricey, expect to pay about $40 or more per head especially if you order their crabs and seafood dishes.
5
The food is great quality, I recommend the salted pepper crab, and signature Singapore crab dish. It is a bite expensive, but work the visit.
3
Jumbo is the type of restaurant where u come for only the food especially if u have overseas guests who want some chilli crab or pepper crab. Very utilitarian place. No ambiance, no service, just eat and go!
3
Not impressed with the chili crab here. The portion size is much smaller and the experience is very rushed. you can get better crabs at other restaurants and pick size small, medium or large. The grilled shrimp was good.
5
We waited in the rain for about 1 hour which made me wonder why we were being so silly when there were plenty of other places to eat (like the place a few shops down that has robot waiters)!We finally were seated in what was some Lord of The Flies survival mission of tacking a paper ticket that seemed to be about as useful as a piece of big roll (thanks to the Chinese who simply believe they can all rudely walk to the front of the queue and not wait like everyone else).The chili crab and pepper crab we had was amazing and there is a good reason they give you the paper bib to wear - it gets very messy
5
You want to eat seafood then Jumbo@ east coast park is for you. The pepper crab is my personal favorite and a close second is the chilli crab. The chilli crab is sweet. You must order the fried buns to go with the chilli crab gravy. Very good place to go with a large group
5
Jumbo seafood started many years ago at east coast parkway. It moved to the Seafood Centre on the east coast of Singapore right in front of the sea at a secluded corner. It has a two storey building where the 2nd floor is air conditioned while Level one is open air and in cool nights can feel the cool breeze as well enjoy the lights that are on the ships just off the coast and enjoying the seafood. Today Jumbo Group is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange and has many branches throughout Singapore. Those wanting to eat in the city can visit the Dempsey outlet or outlets in Clarke Quay. But our favourite is still the original site at the east coast. One can start by having asAppetizers: - Stuffed "You Tiow" which is a dough filled with cuttlefish paste, deep fried.  - small cuttlefish deep fried with sweet sauce. Mains- Singapore Chilli Crab. This is a must. The crabs and the sauce they cooked in is absolutely good and flavorful. A MUST TRY. When you come to visit Singapore, this is a must try dish. - Pepper Crabs. This dish is a variation. Can try if you have more people in the party. If there are only 2-3 pax, can skip this but go for Chilli Crabs. - steamed prawns with garlic- scallops with yam- steamed Fish (cooked in different styles- select one on menu- though steam with soya sauce is a favourite amongst many)Vegetables- pick freshly available vegetables and cook in different styles. Again can select on menu. Most popular is sautéed with garlic and with mushrooms. If you can avoid carbs like fried rice, noodles etc. since one us at a seafood place go for seafood. Must always order a plate of "Man Tou". This is basically bread buns deep fried. It goes very well with the sauce from your Chilli Crab dish. Yummy. This can substitute as your carbs. Avoid all the non seafood things they will ask you like satay and otah (a fish paste that is barbecued in banana leaves). These can be eaten anywhere. When you are at Jumbo, eat mainly seafood. Order a jug of draught Tiger beer to go with the seafood. The national brand beer does goes well with seafood from Jumbo. Again in Singapore while eating seafood, don't try matching your drink by having white wine. Do that in an Italian restaurant . But if you like, they do have white and red wine. Go for it when one is visiting Singapore.

I will not go to jumbo again. the worker is not kind. they often ignore us.reservations is necessary, we had to go out 1 hour. we ordered 2 Chilli sauce and 3 Bamb.c stm garlic.Eating crab was very difficult to us. crab was delicious, but our hands became very dirty... eating crab used a lot of times. I used a tooth to eating it. the cost was 247... I think very expensive. I think almost customers are first time Jumbo. there are probably no repeater. リピートはないです。一回訪れるだけで充分です。働いてる人はとても不親切で、たびたび無視されます。高級店なのに、無愛想な対応。予約しないと入れず、予約をしても1時間ででないといけません。なのでカニを食べるとき常に時間を気にしていました。カニを食べるのが大変難しく、かたい。歯でわれる場合は歯で食べる方が簡単だったが、手がすごく汚れる。おしぼりを何枚ももらい、手を洗いにいきました。チリクラブを2つとニンニクホタテを3つたのんで２４７ドルぐらいでした。すごく高く感じたし、カニの身は多かったが、高すぎると思いました。ほとんどが観光客で初めての来店者で、リピーターはいないんだろうなと思いました

The seafood here is over priced at $70/kg. Each crab is about $68. Chilli crab sauce is nice with peanut added into it. Do order some man-tou(bun) to dip in the sauce. Butter cream crab is not that great though. Would suggest to try chilli or black pepper. If not try the crab glass noodle. Love the deep fried yam with scallop. It's very Cripsy on the outside and great to dip it in sweet sauce. The phoenix chicken has lost its "oomph" taste; it's not as nice as before. It's basically chicken skin onto of seafood paste and there's too much flour in the paste.The deep fried baby squid is nice. A small portion will do unless you don't mind the endless chewing. The baby kailan stir fried with garlic is great especially for kids. Opt for the 1st floor if you have elderly or baby since there's no lift to level 2.Alfresco area is the BEST place for Pokemon fans as there are 2 pokespots just right outside the restaurant and what's even better with FREE WIFI right?!

Chili crabs is still the all time favorite specially with Sri Lanka crabs are the best combination and it's huge!!! The best combination is to eat it with fried mantou / 馒头, or steam bread in English. Other must eat dishes are stir fried baby squids. I visited the east coast outlet where is very spacious and very windy comparing to the one at Singapore river. The service is fast and good.
5
Excellent food at a charming atmosphere. Choice selections in sea food accompanied by smiling service..
5
Though it is in little outskirt's from the City, going there was worth.Crab was ultimate. we also tried sushi. incredible food.
4
Tasty but crab & other dishes size got smaller - means price increased. Portions never enough for hungers..
5
it was the yummiest crab ever at JUMBO and the service is very good! their crab is very huge and juicy
5
The best Chilli crab ever...we make mistake because we don't booked the table...there was full and we have to wait 1 hrs for the table,and worth to wait because the chilli crab are the best
4
This is an iconic place to eat crabs, try both the pepper and chilli crab. The service is professional and food outstanding, make sure you eat with your fingers and try the local bun called mantu.As it's located on a beach front the evening ambience is exceptional. After dinner take a long stroll in the park nearby.You have to book to get a tabl
5
I think the restraurent you can not miss in Singapore. It's very very weath going there, even you can go there by walking from sands by the Bay, through ECP (East Coast Park) AREA A, B ,C. It locate in area D of ECP, 2 hours walking time from waterfront. Excellent experience
4
It's been many times my husband and me treat our guests there. The taste is up to the standards but probably because of they have too many guests the service is not really there. It's very hard to get the waitress attention. Sometimes I doubt they just pretend to be not hearing it
5
It has been the 5th time for myself to eat there. Try both pepper and chili crab this time, i like chili more. But since my daughter is peanuts allergy, so we order pepper as well. Later found out we can ask them not to put peanuts in the chili sauce, Will try next time.Their grill chicken is tender, also they have this fishcakes with chicken skin is super delicious as well. Golden prawn is so so, and avoid the baby fried squid unless you like it with lots of beer.Always book in advance, otherwise if you go after 1930pm, wiil need to wait a bit. Try get seat outside,if weather permits
5
This place is a must visit for Chilli Crab and Pepper crabs. The Crabs are very large and delicious. It is a messy and fun meal and they give you bibs to protect your clothes. Service is good and highly recommend a visit for the carb
5
Food is unbelievably good , service was fantastic and the view of the water had to be seen to be believed.I will definitely return here during my next stay in Singapore.
4
Fast service and great seafood, try Chili crab. First class location at waterfront and fantastic view of vessels on anchorage.
4
It's one of the default seafood restaurant our visitors enjoy. Pepper & Chilli crab, drunken prawns, steam fish are signature dishes. Reasonable prices, 10% discount for members.
5
Atlantic, Mud - Chilli and Black Pepper! the meal was hot and the temp was as well outside at Clarke Quay! It's a mess all over the table but fun with the kids that can eat spicy food!
5
Brought my wife's ex-colleague from overseas to the restaurant. Services was not so polite and friendly. However food was especially nice and delicious especially the signature chilli crab.
4
It's all Chinese food, authentic. Tea comes with your meal. Soft drinks are extra. About $4 US apiece. We saw some people at our table pay that & $6 or $7 for a beer. The service was very good. It's a must see attraction in Hong Kong..
5
We have been going to Jumbo Seafood for last 10 years and have never been disappointed. The one on the east coast park on seaside is the best location specially when the weather is perfect. What do we eat and recommend? Chilli or pepper Crab with steam or fried bun, the fried rice is simply awesome, cereal prawns and tofu and spinach for our veg craving top it up with coconut water and Mango sago.One tip, order pepper Crab as now they serve the gravy of Chili Crab which you can enjoy as well.
5
the experience and service is top notch. you have to order through the electronic menu board set on the table. the waiters are helpful so please ask them for any thing that needs clarification prior order. the shrimp items and fish is a must. you can have soup, noodles, hotpot
3
This is the place to come for arguably the best black pepper crab in the world. Nothing short of amazing. - Their waitstaff are slow, rude, and look rather unhygienic. - your best bet would be to avoid getting disgusted and to just laugh and enjoy the amazing crab. Normally they also have great steamed live shrimp, but they have been out of stock the past two times there.
4
We tried the Chili Pepper Crab and the fried buns with other assorted things. I would definitely recommend the Crab and the Buns if you enjoy such type of cuisines. The food overall is good (not necessarily great) but its quite overpriced for sure. Dinner for 4 cost us approx 200 USD !!!!The location and ambiance beside the sea is awesome, enough open space for the kids to run around. I would recommend that one should experience this at least once if you are in Singapore
4
if black pepper crab is your dish for dinner, then Jumbo definitely the place for you to go tonight! Although the queue is long, but the sms seating notification system is great!
5
Whenever I visit Jumbo, it was so crowded for me not to enjoy the meal.
Fortunately, it was not so many guest in this visit due to early dinner and I could enough enjoy the meal.
4
Had a 4 hour stopover in Singapore & decided to go & have the famous Chilli Crab before boarding to Europe! An experience not to be missed, quick service & great crab!!
5
Chilli crab Singapore is my favourite and the taste so so good and yummy. I love it.. The restaurant so busy, and services are good. All good, no problems at all. We will back for sure :)
5
Second time at jumbo. It was a wonderful experience again.. I'm in love with chilli crab and crave it when I'm away from Singapore. Highly recommend.
4
The food is special really brought out singapore
Very crowded for Monday
Must make booking at east coast the famous branch
At least after many years standard never drop
5
After much research and eventually staking out the restaurant for them to book a seat..... then go on the wait list to get a "Shared table" there was no way i was not going to be in singapore and not have the chilli crab. ..... Truely i got my moneys worth - the flavours and taste was exceptional.I have never worked so hard to get at or eat my food ... ever!I thoroughly enjoy it.... and the sauce got everywhere.I enjoyed sitting at a shared table too..... it was a chance to talk to other travellers..... a couple from melbourne on their way to paris.... and a business woman from Houston texas....A once in a lifetime experience.... and couldnt be missed
5
We went there for the high review of Singapore chilli crab, and it was totally awesome!! The taste and variety of defies they offered in the restaurant are amazing! Both me and my hubby were satisfied with the foods we had! Strongly recommend to anyone who's traveling to Singapore!
1
Every 2 years, my family would travel to Singapore to visit. And every 2 years, we would go to Jumbo Seafood restaurant. Well, as of our trip in June/July 2016, that will be our last time there. While the food is good, it is not good enough for the price they charge (especially for the portion size).We used to go there for the great food (Black Pepper Crab) with extended family. On our previous trip, for a plate Black Pepper Crab, Broccoli, Hor Fun Noodles and a few more dishes (not seafood items), it amounted to about S$400 for a family of 10. I thought it was expensive before. About 2 weeks ago, we went with a total of 10 people again (I vegetarian and 4 young kids). For 3 crabs, 1 medium braised tofu, 1 med Hor Fun, 1 med Broccoli with garlic, 1 sm Kang Kong vegetables, 8 small bowls of plain rice, 1 med sweet/sour pork, 2 pitchers of beer ($28 each?), and a few sodas cost us about S$700. And the portions were very SMALL!Everyone at the table were stunned! Looking at the itemized receipt, each crab cost almost S$100! And the service wasn't even good. We had ordered a 2nd pitcher of beer 3X and had to physically take the empty pitcher to our server before we got service. Had to ask for chilli sauce 2-3 times. And the Kang Kong vegetable came last after we almost done eating the crab when we were out of rice. Everyone at the table were so shock at the price as we were conscious not to order the high ticket price items such as prawns, mussels, scallops, fish etc.I also went to check the prices at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant and noticed that the prices were in the same range. No more seafood experience along the East Coast Ocean. How unfortunate! Way overpriced
5
If you've never heard of it, don't miss it. The Chili Crab is the best but the tiger prawns, calamari,spicy noodles, are all superb. Great view off East Coast Park as well. Don't wear clothes you are afraid of getting messy. No way the bib will prevent everything from getting on you
5
The chili crab is a must-do dish while in Singapore and what better venue than right on the water. Be sure to get a reservation to avoid a long wait. It is a bit pricey so be prepared for that as well.
3
Uhhm.I came here with my friend.We are other Chilies Crad,breaks, and something...
Food very nice.Because Im so hungry.Many costumers come here at the night.Little bit is Staff service spent lots time,and expensive.
5
The Chilli Crab is great but the Black Pepper Crab is even better. If you are a lover of top quality seafood cuisine don't miss this place!!!
5
i am sure that the other jumbo branches that dot this city is just as good... but the east coast branch is the place to be... you just can't beat having fresh seafood next to the sea! lots of choices... and if you can't decide, let the staff make recommendations... you just can't go wrong
2
Visited with family to try much hyped Chilli crab, waited in queue to be seated which was fair enough, went down hill from there ! Despite repeated attempts to get attention of staff to take order we sat for 30 mins before finally getting order taken, to then be told 45 mins wait for crab. It's what Jumbo's trades on for gods sake ! By this time it wasn't that busy either. Ordered some fried baby squid to start, in the 3 weeks I've been in Singapore it was the worst food I've had, like really bad pork scratching's. When crab arrived it was pretty decent particularly the black pepper, didn't see what the big fuss is about the chilli. Service throughout was terrible and to top it off I watched a waiter tip a bowl of peanuts from a table back into the container they keep them in. To sum up, over priced,over rated living off an old reputation I would not go back or recommend
5
We enjoyed our meal outside and it was delicious. Loved the chili crab and pepper crab and the delicious little biscuits served to swab up the chili sauce. Amazing to find venison on the menu of a seafood restaurant - it was delicious! Everything was excellent, great service and a fun place to eat
4
We have ordered some dishes for 4 of us:-1) Chilli crab and pepper crab. We were told each crab weigh 1.3KG! - The Chilli crab is the best we have tasted thus far, pepper crab is not too bad. The crabs are huge with huge claws! The crab meat are so juicy. Dip some bread into the chilli crab sauce, it yummilicious! 2) Yam ring with scallop. - This is a must try dish, yam is fried to perfection and remained soft, do dip into their sweet dipping sauce. 3) 900gm live soon hock fish to be steamed Hong Kong style.- fresh delicious fish, can't go wrong with Hong Kong Style Steam. 4) Sambal Kang Kong (water spinach)- spicy and well cooked!We finished all the food with no room for their dessert. Will be there again soon
4
Like many visitors to Singapore we had Jumbo on our 'must do' list - having heard it was the best Chilli Crab in town...which is Cleary why it's so hard to get in to. On arrival we noticed other tables tucking in to Black Pepper Crab and decided to give that a go instead of Chilli Crab. This turned out to be an excellent decision on our part - it was sensational. Granted, it's an expensive exercise with our crab alone being around $80 - but it was well worth it. The crab was juicy and cooked to perfection. The sauce was almost indescribable...it was subtle yet flavoursome. It didn't overpower the taste of the crab, rather drew out its flavour. It's a messy process but you'll be given a bib and water bowl to wash your hands. And to be honest that just adds to the overall experience. We simply had crab and fried rice - which is like no other fried rice I've ever eaten. We were amazed at how something so simple could be bursting with such tastiness. I would recommend booking online. They do take walk ins but you'll be waiting near an hour at least. We will definitely be going back.
4
Went to the newer branch at Dempsey near to end of Orchard Road. Expect it to be on high end. For tourists, if you really wish to experience great seafood, most of the non air condition ones offered in Hawker centers are equally awesome. That you can have a more local experience. Unless you want great comfort, Jumbo is one of the reputable one
5
So, when you only visit every one or two years, there's one thing always on the list. Crab! Jumbo does good crab and has been doing for a while. No hands is good too but Jumbo is always a safebet. Inside has aircon but I would go outside so your food doesn't get cold. Favourites are the Chilli crab but the pepper and the salted egg are also pretty good. Can't wait to be back
4
Jumbo is notorious for its chilli crab but its easy to feel that they are trading on the name. The crab is ok but nowhere near the best crab I have had in Singapore.
5
It is absolutely lovely to have this chilly Crab etc in this authentic restaurant. It is a MUST try version of Singapore style and you will love it. Many other delicious dishes also good to try.
5
As far as hawker halls go, this is one of the best. Great display of cooking and the extensive menu is simple but the taste and quality of food is exceptional. A must do.
4
Jumbo is a place that can accommodate big groups like ours (we were 26) and their waiters were adept at taking orders. Prices were expensive but food was good. Highly reccomend the black pepper crabs and the chili crabs.
5
Don't miss the chilli crab from this place! It is Singapore very own recipe and the taste is very nice from this place
5
Excellent seafood. A little pricey but consistency of quality and taste is maintained.
Service is excellent and popular among the tourist.
5
Jumbo seafood restaurant was recommended to us and certainly lived up to our high expectations! We didn't book and luckily could sit on a shared table, it was very busy , the chilli crabs are delicious but messy, though you are given a bib and hand cleaning bowls. Definitely worth the work, prince for this specialty was on the high side but for a one off experience ( to me) worth it. High turnover of tables not for a long leisurely meal.
4
If you are looking for a nice, local seafood restaurant and try the famous pepper crab, you need to stop by at Jumbo. There are many restaurants of Jumbo in Singapore but I would recommend the one in the East Coast instead of Clarke Quay out of two reasons: you have a nice ocean view in the East Coast and the menu is richer with better prices. The pepper crab is a must try. You should eat it with your hands and avoid plastic hand gloves but don't forget to wear your apron. If you hang your jacket on your chair, ask for a special jacket cover. They have also very nice assortment of dim sums and much more. The local beer "Tiger" is also highly recommended. Enjoy.
5
The restaurant was extremely organised and clearly familiar with the rush of diners. We didn't really know how to order so we missed out on getting rice so that was a bit sad but it was still completely enjoyable. I would also have loved to have had a bag full of tissues and wet ones but we managed with the one wet one from the restaurant. An unforgettable and delicious dinner. Don't miss the fresh coconut drink.
5
The crabs here are always a good idea :) we always bring our friends from other countries here and they love the crab as well!! One of Singapore's unique local dish! I personally prefer the black pepper to the chilli crab - but both are good honestl
3
The food served is nice but waiting time is long, the attitude of servant need to be improved. Environment is noisy during dinner.
5
Must get seafood rice, bamboo prawns, sweet & sour fish (not on menu) & mango dessert. Their curried crab is fabulous too, but messy & a lot of work to eat (get gloves if possible & don't wear white).
5
The service crews at Jumbo near river view provide good service and the food here are nice , the chili crab is one of my favorite dishes here, juicy and soft .
5
Probably the best Jumbo in Singapore best crab amazing service and cold cold beer recommend the pepper crab always a favourite for visitors!
5
Great eating experience. First time having crab so got a bit messy pulling apart. I certainly need a lesson in how to be dainty. All the food was delicious and we had good seats and view. Booked in advance and lucky because it was very, very busy
4
Always love to bring visitors to jumbo seafood and especially the one at the east coast as the overall atmosphere is great and the food is authentic and good. The service is always a bit hectic as they have to turn over the tables quite fast but good wise a great experience for some truly Singaporean dishes. Boat key location is also nice , the Dempsy location might be convenient but thought the food was not so good... I like to eat chili and pepper crab at the sea side and not in a closed restaurant
4
A horrible place for non-seafood eaters like me. However, I had to join my colleagues and got some alternatives (duck, chicken). Finally I got told the seafood was perfect, same was for all other dishes, too. The prices are still reasonable and we could not complain about anything. The ambiance is not nice and it is crowded. Without reservation you have a 45 minute waiting time
5
We had the chili prawns, scallops, venison on a hot plate and the pepper Sri Lankan crabs. I must say this was the best scallops and crabs I have ever had. to balance out the heat from the pepper try the fried buns they have.A wonderful meal by the waters
4
There are several Jumbo Seafood Restaurants in Singapore but we wanted to try this one at East Coast Parkway because of the waterfront location and ease of access and parking. Dining out at restaurants in Singapore can be quite costly especially dining on seafood. The bottom line is if you want quality, service and ambience, you usually have to pay a bit more. We arrived at 7pm and the restaurant was packed. Lucky for us we had made reservations. We were seated out by the promenade close to the sea wall and the view was fantastic. The hundreds of ships and vessels off ECP were lit up and it was like looking at a sea of light on the sea. Every dish we ordered was good and everyone loved the black pepper crab, Singapore chilli crab and steamed groupa on light soy sauce with a hint of sesame oil and garnished with slices of green onions and ginger. For non seafood fans the local dishes were also very good. We had a lot of fun watching the bustling crowd including the young ladies promoting Tiger and Anchor beer. Overall a very good night. As mentioned, dining out in fine restaurants in Singapore can get costly but we were pretty happy with our visit there
5
here green mud crab dish is superb . this restaurant is famous for sea food in singapore.its having chain of hotels in all places. hot .hot yammy yammy dishes of prawns fry , fish head, pomplet fry and grabs dishes is very famous here. its on of the leading restaurant .and the service is very nice and respect .so for tasty sea food we have to visit this place once for new sea food dishes
2
Overpriced and doesn't taste good at all.
Don't bother. Spend your money elsewhere. Staff are from China and can't speak English. They will just assume.
3
Disappointed!! Party of 4 Shared lunch -yam scallops, pork ribs, chilli crab & pepper crab +1 drink each. Service not very attentive. Very expensive! Served excessively large amount of crab - cost S$360!!
2
Quite good quality, but is almost more tourist restaurant with variety of seafood
At least you have to taste the black pepper crab dish
4
This is one of the many good sea food restaurants here.The food is good and tasty.The service is good.
4
Lucky to get in at the last minute without booking. Very crowded, very busy but what a delicious dish-the chilli crab!
4
ok location, sat outside, quick service, could have done with more napkins or wipes as of eating chilli crab can be a messy affair...
food was good, but not extraordinary
4
A very good meal of Singapore Chilli Crab. You won't be disappointed. Service was slick and accommodating. We didn't book and still they managed to find a table. Recommend you book because this is a popular spot with the tourists and the locals.
5
We had eaten crab . It was very nice and very very fresh . The waitress who looked after our table , she was very nice .The food , the view , the cleanliness was unbeatable . The price doesn't matter, we knew how expensive was before we would go there . So don't complain . The slight down side was we 'd got charged for a small plate of peanut that we haven't ordered . We didn't eat it so i told one of the waitress that we have neither order nor touched . It wasn't the big amount on the bill but i thought it was a joke . You put it on the table as its complimentary but then you charged us !! Anyway , we will definitely go back there if we get back to Singapore again 
4
Myself, my boyfriend and two friends had lunch here a couple of weeks ago. We had a chilli crab, black pepper crab, and about 3 or 4 other dishes between us, as well as a beer each. The food was excellent, service standard for Singapore (I.e not quite what we have come to expect in Western Europe), but it was soooo expensive - equivalent of about Â£200 between the four of us - ouch
5
We had heard about how amazing the Chili Crab was and now can attest to it! Such a wonderful meal and a great way to begin our trip in Singapore. The bibs were an added delight and did help to keep our clothes free of sauce :) Really, how else can you eat chili crab than by getting right in there with your hands?
4
Visited May 2016. We took a taxi to the East Coast Seafood Centre which we had heard was the best place. The Crab was delicious and the service good. I can recommend Jumbo Seafood to other vistors.
4
Jumbo is an Institution and especially AT Dempsey Hills a great Restaurant. Not a touristic as at Clarke Quai... black pepper crabs are a clear winner.. the Chili ones are not because there are not spicy as they should...
5
The most awesome Crabs ever. The service was awesome.
Please try the black pepper crab if possible.
We loved it and I do not normally eat crabs :-)
5
Singapore Jumbo Seafood the place to get chilli crab when in Singapore you must try chilli crab at lest once .
5
Being a big fan of Jumbo - I had to take my family there. The Jumbo outlets in downtown Singapore are nice - but this is significantly better. Having Chilli Crab right at the sea is just fantastic. We´ll be back soon ...
3
Popular Singapore restaurant chain. Fast food for fish! but nothing wrong with that. Fish all well prepared, quick delivery. If you're having crab is can get messy although plastic gloves and bibs are provided. All dishes are respectable but none have the wow factor. Service was unfriendly but efficien
3
If you are not a sea food fun then this is not a place to dine. I don't do most of the sea food offered as they were too exotic for my comfort but I loved the hotel, the surrounding is a view to behold; decorated with ancient pieces that go way back in history. Service is great regardless of the limited menu.Nice people
5
Was on a business trip and I ate here with 3 of my co-workers. Food was great. There was a cod dish that was really good. Service was good. I didn't pay so I don't know about the prices but I would recommend this restaurant on the excellent quality of the food
4
Went here for dinner had the crispy squid chilli crab and the scallops all were really great. Service was fast but they weren't rushing you. Really enjoyed this place it was on the east coast the ships had their lights on it looked magic in the dark. Would definitely return here. There is a few jumbos around Singapore this one I would recommend. I didn't dine at the others
3
It is a very popular seafood chain in Singapore and their Chili crab is very famous, even if I think their sauce is too strong and you cannot really feel the crab taste.But be careful, you will have to use your hands if you take the crabs.That's sad because it could be a very nice place but waiters do look so sad and restrooms are not really clea
5
Best chilly crab! My husband and I are crab eaters, and we love the crabs here! The chilly crab is the best! The bamboo clam is also delicious however they sold out easily.
4
Jumdo Sea Food was recommended by my nephew and it was worth it. Mouthwatering Sea food, umumum Jumbo Prawns were a delicacy. And there was another dish omg it was The Lobster !!!!!
2
the place is cute, with a nice views but the food leaves much to be desired. Deliver a Bib for each client which makes it funny the situation and are very necessary because the sauce that the food has.
reasonable care.
5
Wow , what a place! Six of us went for dinner and enjoyed a taste sensation. Thank goodness we arrived early , by 18h00 the place was completely full. We had both chilli as well as pepper crab which was fantastic. As well as this the chocolate flavored pork ribs were initially a bit weird on my conventional palate, but I was soon sold on this dish. Our trip to the mind blowing Singapore ended superbly with a visit to Jumbo Sea Food.
4
The place in both locations are great make a booking to save more than a hour of waiting time and better seat, the food the chilly crab spectacular you most taste this delicious dish, the pepper crab is improving but good.And a few dishes to explore you never regret a tasty seafood, try also Jumbo Prawns, is a good place to eat
4
For aure we had the house speciality crab but all the other food we had was good too.If i go for crab in Singapore I'll go for Jumbo again.Only thing that's annoying is the waiting times to get a table and the limited time you have for your dinner!They really do need a lot more space to serve all the customers.The waiters were friendly and even very busy able to have a small chat
5
I am not a great foodie, but Singapore makes you one, and primarily to one single destination restaurant JUMBO.The Pepper Crab is the best that I have ever eaten anywhere in the world, and don't miss the Chilli Crabs.I have a severe allergic reaction when it comes to Shell Fish. But I pop on my Anti Allergic, one hour prior to relish the Crabs.It's worth the bite.
5
We visited Jumbo Seafood twice out of the 5 days we were in Singapore. Despite the wait, we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Jumbo. We ordered their Crab speciality which was delicious with the little mantou. Highly recommend and will definitely be back when we travel to Singapore again
4
Originally was going to head into Jumbo Seafood Gallery but the atmosphere was pretty foodcourt-ish so continued walking in the direction of Clarke Quay to the next Jumbo Seafood. Didn't pre-book a table so was stuck outside which was fine. Ordered the small plates of fried baby squid and de-shelled prawns in cereal for starters and the famous Chilli crab for main. Starters were delicious. Came out pretty quick and it was a good serving for two. When the crab came out we had no idea how to eat this so it became pretty messy and without napkins everything went everywhere. The meal was delicious but massive! If we had of known that the crab was 800g plus sauce we would have just got the one starter. Had one of the cheapest wines at $50 which wasn't too bad for Singapore pricing. Service from waiting staff was quick if not a bit over the top trying to clear away plates while you still had food on them but if you planned it right they would clear the plates as the crab shell piled up. Not too much of a view as we were crammed between the walk way and the service pillar. Would have been nice to look over the water.
4
I'm told by Singaporeans that Jumbo is a bit of a tourist trap. But the chilli crab was pretty awesome, as was the rest of the meal. Very fresh and tasty seafood, cold beer and attentive service.It's not cheap, and in fact nothing is very cheap in Singapore. But worth it
4
Efficient service, although a bit pricey, very authentic and tasty local food.
a must try if you are looking for true Singapore food experience.
4
Great pepper crap, worth trying yourself
But as anywhere in Singapore expensive
Always busy but they will go great length to accommodate
4
Jumbo is by far the best sea food place inSingapore you just have to see the crowds Everyday to appreciate how people enjoy this place. The selections are great and service is excellent
5
We enjoyed the wonderful service and freshly made dim sum at this seafood restaurant. Fresh Ingredients, prompt and attentive service. Do make advance reservations as it is very popular among families on weekends.
4
Gets very busy at night, so be prepared to wait 15 minutes or so, you must try the chilli crab, bib supplied it can get a little messy.
3
Most tourists love to go Jumbo Seafood restaurant. Price can be expensive if order crabs. Better to ask price before ordering. The restaurants need reservation and ask waiter to recommend their signature dishes if you do not know how to order. However, there are many more good restaurants in Singapore serving seafood. Tourists have many choices... Singapore is a food heaven....
5
I have been living in Singapore for 15 years and this is my go to place for seafood. Personally I prefer the black pepper crab but the chilli is also good. The service will be mixed so my advice is to stagger your order otherwise all the dishes can come at once. I find that the riverwalk outlet or Dempsey outlets are more relaxing and less crowded but I've also had good meals at the east coast outlet here. Other dishes are baby kalian in garlic, cereal prawns and the steamed fish can also be very nice. Better for larger groups so you can sample/share as much as possible
4
The pricing though it may be a bit on the steep side but I can't ignore the taste and perfect blend of spiciness and texture of the gravy that came with it.Ambience was ok and the staff needs some really good CSR (Customer Service Relations) course as at times, they can be seen as rude and disconnected with their guests

We eat here every time we are in Singapore and this time was a bit of a disappointment. My husband enjoyed his chilli crab but as I don't eat chilli I had seafood noodles which only had a few small prawns and not much else. My meal was served almost 10 minutes after my husbands and the bread we ordered never came but we were still charged for it. The service was slow this time. There is another Jumbo at Clarke Key so we might just try that one next time
3
Whilst the chilli crab sauce and flavour was pretty special. We had to waste a lot of the crab as the claw she'll which is very hard was not broken enough and the staff didn't seem to want to help. The utensils couldn't break the shell either. 140 Singapore $ for 1 serve chilli crab 1 serve broccoli and 1 corona.

Must try the signature menu at Jumbo Seafood : Chiili Crab.
The Crab is so big and tasty.. I like the Chiili Crab sauce.

We have always enjoyed bringing our own wine to go with its dishes with complimentary cockage. To our dismay, they have since stopped this service late last year.
4
Great fresh seafood , reasonable price , fast and good service , next to the sea and fantastic for family dinner and get together . Highly recommended . We even got free fruits for dessert ;)
4
I started enjoying from the point of having the house tea until wiping the last sauce stain from my lips!!! A must try - Harfan, Fried Rice and of course, the main event, "Chili Crab!"
5
One of the best crabs u can ever have .. Love this place . Always a must visit when in Singapore . Located just besides Clarke quay

We had booked dinner in advance at Jumbo's. This was a good venue as it gave us the option of having dinner indoors (with strong a/c) or outside by the water. We chose to fine inside. Pros: Highly recommend the chilly crab and black pepper crab dish. We ordered two crabs between three people plus other side dishes including drunken prawns, greens etc. Overall we were all satisfied and thought it was reasonably priced. Cons: Service was quite slow, hard to get the waiters attention.

Sadly to say Jumbo Seafood has gone into mass cooking and no longer as tasty as before. Service staff too pre-occupied attending to foreign groups. Lack that personalised service.For the chili crab, abalone, fried seafood noodles & lime juice for 2 persons, the bill read SGD $128.No longer worth thar dollar. Unlikely to visit again

First, the location. It is midway to the airport, so be aware the taxi will cost you about 16SGD each way if you live in the center of Singapore. Many local families, nice and lively atmosphere, and an amazing view at the ocean. The first floor is not air conditioned, but the second floors is. We've ordered about 6 main courses and they were all excellent, both vegetables, noodles, fish and the famous chilli crab. Portions were large and reasonably priced. Large selection of fresh fish and shellfish. My only complaint is the tableware, particularly the plastic plates that are maybe 12cm in diameter. Eating large crab covered in thick gravy is more or less impossible without making a mess. In other words bring wet wipes, or order something else. Particularly recommend the chilli crab, lime prawns and crispy noodles with shellfish.
4
My friends and even my taxi driver recommended this place as "the" place for Singapore's best known Black Pepper Crab. Their crab is simply awesome. It was fresh, its complex and explosive. It's big (900 gm), lots of sweet juicy meat and strong black pepper flavour. It really lives up to its reputation. Also try its deep-fried cuttle fish rice roll. Its one of their speciality that I have not tasted anywhere else. The place is always busy but since this location is away from downtown, you can get a table quite fast. Service is friendly and efficient. It's a great place for family or friends gathering
4
Love this place for Chili Crabs and Gooey Duck! Expect the food to be a little messy they provide bibs) but the quality is good. No air conditioning so be prepared to be a little warm. Service is hurried and this restaurant is crowded. Expect to wait to be seated
5
Chili Crab at Jumbo Seafood overlooking the bay is just what this part of the world is about, fantastic food in a great location surrounded by all the tastes of the region sums up what Singapore is about. Great food, hot, lively atmosphere, brilliant.
5
Getting a service of deep fried squid as a snack to the beer, prawn with chilli and bbq'ed and then finaly the end the Black pepper crab. so nice so recomadendable.
5
Restaurant in a nice setting overlooking the ocean/beach. The food was incredible. We had several dishes including scallops, chili crab, and black pepper crab. The Black Pepper Crab was simply orgasmic. One of the most incredible flavor sensations I've ever experienced.
5
Jumbo with its wide selection remains one of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore. A great way to hang out with friends or treat the family!
5
A work colleague recommended this place while I was in Singapore for business. I had a greasy lunch and was not to convinced but tagged along with a group of people. We ordered the chili and pepper crab, seafood fried rice and scallops with vegetables. All of the dishes were amazing and not greasy at all. The fried rice was light and the perfect vehicle to eat as much of the left over chili sauce as possible. The sauce was fantastic, not too sweet, not greasy, just perfect. Our party were blown away.Not sure if it matters but we went to the East Coast location of Jumbo Seafood. About a 10 min cab ride from down town. There are other locations as well but I can't speak to the quality. It sounded like this one was the place to go
5
We visited the restaurant 3times on our holiday to SIN for 5 daysWe opted for 1kilo chilli crab each time approx 90 SGD including taxes just for the crab it was great every time , great service , other dishes are great also. For rice etc you have choice of small medium and large , when we bought out rice ( fried rice with salted fish ) we got a large , way to big for 2 people could of feed 6. Small / medium would be more than enough if just the 2 of u Yes there is a wait for a table (30-45 mins ) however if u have ur mobile number they will text when table ready , plenty of things to look about in the area worth taking a stroll rather than waiting , there are 2 jumbo in Clarke / boat key so they may suggest that you visit the other restaurant if busy . Defo the place to go for the famous chilli cra
4
Normally my family will go to Jumbo Restaurant at Indoor Stadium before its closure a few years back.So nowadays we visit Jumbo NSRCC instead. Their live geoduck dish is delicious... whether eaten raw with wasabi and sauce or semi-cooked with their soup base. Chilli or Black pepper crabs are very delicious too and not forgetting their seafood Mee goreng which is a must-try for spicy food lovers
3
Recently, went to Jumbo Dempsy for a business dinner as request by the client. The portions are small but standard are relatively high. We like the chili and black pepper crab very much. It's one of the best in Singapore. Unfortunately, the price is high but it's a good experience for once in awhile indulgence
4
To be honest you're probably only going to go here to order one thing, the Chili Crab, which we did - and it didn't disappoint. As a venue it is absolute heaving. Not the most glamourise of settings and certainly not cheap, but worth going once at least
5
Pricing isn't clear as it's mainly market rate but it's no problem to ask. We had 1kg of crab for 2 of us which was enough and we had fried rice as a side to go with it.Food was excellent but crap was messy as you would expect, you get a bib and plenty wet wipes but maybe worth taking a few napkins along.All in a great experience, very busy restaurant but plenty room so we got a table without booking (Thursday night)
4
Must do when visiting Singapore but extremely popular so you must book. The queue goes round the corner. Outside is good overlooking the harbour as long as it's not pouring with rain! It's reassuringly expensive so save up.
5
Best chilly crab ever. Service great. Can recommend to anyone in or visiting Singapore. Not cheap but excellent value.
5
One of the best fish restaurants in Singapore. Although it is part of a chain with many different outlets around Singapore, the quality and authenticity of the food is amazing. Best chili crab and cereal prawns in town!
5
Beautiful at night, good seafood, very atmospheric with a great mix of locals, expats and tourists. Burn off the calories with a stroll up and down the seafront afterwards. And there are good dishes beyond just the Chili crab!
3
Evening falls warm and glowing by the Singapore river; a reception desk welcomes queues whilst another 20 or so waits in a sitting area after their portable alarm peeps when the number is due.efficient and accurate, our orders arrived soon enough. by requesting for just moderate hotness, our black pepper crab was fingerlicking good without burning tastebuds or tummy.Nce to have free flow of iced Chinese tea.The blachan.kangkong was expected. venison with vegetables a bit over coated with conflour.in all a nice meal for 2 @ 100 euros , not cheap but good
5
As part of my Singapore trip, I had to try the Singapore Chilli Crab. We were passing jumbo seafood and noticed it quite busy at 6pm. It also jiggled my memory that in a well known travel publication, this was one place to try this dish.As it was a busy place we were notified the next sitting was at 7.30pm, so the race was on! I ordered a medium crab which I was told was approx 1.2kg. We also ordered a few other dishes which were very tasty and did not disappoint.Well in short, this crab definitely did not disappoint. Being very familiar with the blue manner crab in Western Australia, this crab was full of meat and the sauce delicious. The only thing is that the bill for this crab was $93SG ++ (over $100SG), and to me if it was not for the experience I would walk away as the SG and AU $ is approx 1:1 and I would never pay this in my home country.Overall the service was good and the crab very tasty. But a once in a lifetime experience for this price!
4
If your in a hurry and hungry don't wait. ...but if you want great chilli crab then you best wait. A good selection of seafood, but the crab seems to be the favourite. They give you gloves and a bibb to devour the beastie, very messy but worth digging - unfortunately no choice of alcoholic drinks. Singapore sling or beer??? Very busy restaurant a little over priced but that seems to be everywhere in Singapore, which is a shame cause tourists will stop visiting. Great position by the river, pretty view as the sun goes down, all in all worth doing.
3
After waiting over 30 minutes for a table, the experience of eating here was underwhelming. We had the famous chilli crab, which was good, a jumbo prawn each which was also good. However, the cost was very high for the quality of the food and service provided. A far better dining experience can be had at the night markets at the marina and there is a better atmosphere at a fraction of the cost
2
Terrible service and cleanliness. If it weren't for the reputation and decent location - you simply wouldn't bother. Best for groups, not couples. We arrived late and were told restaurant closes at 11:45pm. Didn't stop them packing up from around 10:45pm . . . Go elsewher
4
This is a lovely location for having seafood. The famous Singapore east coast seafood center. Need to come either early or after the rush hour.. Good fresh food and try the pepper crabs and drunken prawns.. Love it.. Service is average due to the many people they services..Enjoy the food and environment
5
I like this restaurant a lot. The chilli crab and razor clams are fantastic. The location is good too, and it is even a convenient stopping off point on the way from the city to airport.
4
I enjoyed this place. Very Chinese Atmosphere, very good food! The Chilli Crab was excellent. But also the other dishes we had have been of great taste. I recommend this place without concerns.
5
Had the Black Pepper Crab. Very Very yummmy & very very expensive. But all worth it !!
I took a good 2 hours to finish.
4
This is a good restaurant to have crabs.They have good crab menu.The food is tasty and fresh.The price good The service is also good.
5
Best of all the Jumbo locations in Singapore in my opinion. Great outdoor/undercover venue with awesome views out to sea. Fresh air and great mix of expats, tourists and locals. The food is amazing and it is great fun, especially for large groups of family or friends. Lunchtime gets a bit hot but dinner time here on a breezy night is heavenly. Huge parking lot right at the back too for easy access
4
Chili crab was delicious! should also try the scallop wrapped in yam. Lobster salad for a start was a good choice too.Because of the packed place, it is hard to sometime get waitress to come around the table, so dont expect too much on the service, just appreciate the good food
1
You'll have to wait at least 45 to 50mins for the chilli crab. I got here when it was only half empty. Waiter (Andy Tay) could have told us it was going to take that long. When asked for our food they just ignored us and kept doing their own thing. It is expensive for what you get. You expect good service but they even forgot to give us the crab cracker! You get better food and service and cheaper elsewhere. What a disappointment! It's also dirty. There's lizard poo everywhere as shown in the photos. There's rats too!!!!
3
We didn't find the service that good. Their English was poor and the meals were extremely pricey. Tip. When ordering the crab ask the price and what it is. Dont order the Alaskan crab as you'll pay dearly for it like I did. I wont go back
4
The menu has a wide variety and the food is good. We have had the chilli and pepper crabs as well as the deep fried baby quite a few times. It's lovely to have dinner here because it's so close to the beach and you can take a nice walk after eating lots
3
Went here with high expectations of the food! First of all it's expensive, the chilicrab is 85$ which is a lot, but I guess okay for seafood, every side dish is highly priced too. My expectations wasn't met, and the food was not as tasty as I was told.. They put peanuts and tea on the table when you sit down as if it was free, but then charge you for it. It's not a bad restaurant, and if you're in the mood for sea food I would recommend it as the crab it self was gorgeous and tasty, but we did wait 35 mins to get it.
5
Pepper Crab and Drunken Prawns are the best at Jumbo. If you want to experience pepper crab, there is only one place in Singapore. At Jumbo, they have the perfect recipe, you will not be disappointed. Be prepared to get finger lickin good pepper crab.
5
As always a delight to eat here, great place, great staff, great food. The East Coast operation is slick, well run and a real pleasure to visit.
5
Went on a Monday, place not too crowded at all. Staff were excellent and waitress really took great care of us. Pepper Crabs were to die for. She really made us feel welcome and helped with menu recommendations! Heck yeah I'm going back!
1
This is probably the worst place ive ever had to eat. They give you bibs to eat with which should send out red flags that its not the classiest establishment. its run like a military operation where the staff have walkie talies and talk like robots. Staff have designated roles and they can only perform those roles which i ridiculous. They also serve shark fin which is disgusting!!!
4
Good value to sign up for Jumbo membership as it gives you $100 birthday voucher which we used on this occasion.Although we had made prior reservation at Dempsey, still had to wait till table was available. Food was good especially chilli crab which was fresh and meaty
5
Clare's Quay is so, so busy. And that definitely follows for this outdoor restaurant perched on the quayside. There is a small waiting area with a few chairs, all outside. The person on front of house registers your attendance and your are given a number and they ask for a contact phone number. Behind the front of house person there is a monitor and when your number pops up on the screen you are shown to your table. All waiting staff have radio microphones so they relay your order to the kitchen as you pick items from the menu. This speeds things up. The chilli crab and the black pepper crab are fantastic. Order some rice as well if having crab because there's quite a bit of sauce. All in all a great experience. I've ticked the box on that one now
5
We enjoyed a whole chilli crab with steamed buns at Jumbo's overlooking Clarke Quay. The steamed buns are a must as they complemented the chilli crab dish exceptionally! It was such a great evening we would highly recommend it! A must on your things to do list!
5
Went there with family this afternoon, April 03, 2016.My first visit to this place in this visit and perhaps the Nth in so many years!!You can't go wrong over here.The portions are huge, the items are plenty to select from and of course you can have beer, tender coconut water and finally Chinese tea.An excellent choice for a leisurely Sunday lunch with the whole family
5
I had chilli crab on by the waters edge at Clarks Quay. The excitement of the buzzing crowd, the exquisite taste of the juices from the perfectly cooked crab, the tactile joy of drawing fresh meat through cracked crab shell: all the time chatting to new found companions sharing the table... Outdoors at Jumbo is an all around thrill and a must on any trip to Singapore. Treat yourself - go there.
5
This the place for the famous Singapore Chilli Crab. It is right by the beach amongst other seafood eateries but I was reliably informed that Jumbo served one of the best chilli crab.I was not disappointed as the sauce was exquisite . Coming from the UK, I am only used to those served up in Chinatown London. There really is no comparison.It is very busy and very noisy but I think that's what it's like in most places like thisWell worth a visit
4
Excellent chili crab - I have only had it once and here, so hard for me to compare to other places in Singapore, but this was an excellent dinner and would recommend it to someone looking to get some of the local flavor of Singapore.
4
The food was really good. We ordered family style and every dish was a knock out. Very busy, service was okay. We ate outside and would come back again. Try the ribs it has a chocolate flavour - Amazing
4
Good sea food but truly expensive, except the tiger beer for sure. Grt taste but even a peanut is charged. Very very touristic but good marketing, lot of crowd
3
Had tried Chili Crab here the 1st time. It tastes right at the point. Crab was huge and valued for money. We were 4 girls, ordered 2 big crabs and extra 2 bowls of rice to eat with the tasty chili sauce. Crabs come together with a crab-cracker and a paper "baby-napkin" - which was cute and helpful because you don't have to worry about your clothes get dirty afterwards. We paid about 80 SGD for 2 crabs, 2 bowls of rice and wet towels. Hot tea was complimentary. The restaurant was super busy on that day, we have booked a table at 18:00 directly at the counter, waited ourside for almost 2 hours and finally got our seats at 20:00 approximately. Therefore, i recommend you to book the table as soon as you can to avoid waiting too long outside
4
There's no question about the food quality at the Jumbo. Make sure reservation is made to avoid disappointment. Crab dishes being the signature..chilli crab is a must in Singapore and at the Jumbo. Appreciate the flexibility in allowing external food from the Muslim restaurant next door.
4
Jumbo at Dempsey has free parking. We prefer dining alfresco. So 8 of us come and we decided to avoid the stellar dishes. They did not have the golden phoenix chicken, so we had the same prawn filling on yo tiao (Chinese fried savory pastry) and it ws a big hit!The fried soon hock fish with soy sauce was done to perfection. Good baby kailan greens, if a tad hard for our seniors. And our new piece de resistance is the salted egg yolk prawns! The seniors pronounced it tastier and less messy than Chilli Crab which we did not have! Spinach on tofu with mushrooms delighted the vegetarian and the seniors. Fish hor fun was done to the perfection of our hor fun expert. Simple fruit platter finished the dinner with our palates cleansed and refreshed
4
I went to Jumbo with a larg group and we had a wonderful meal. The Pepper and chili crab is awesome. We also tried many other dishes and found all of them to be fresh and well prepared. Sitting outside next to the ocean is very nice. It can however be very hot out
1
Quite possibly one of the worst eating experiences of my life. The waitress was rude, scowling, and unkind. She didn't understand what we wanted and didn't bring us what we ordered even though I was speaking extra carefully and slowly. How is it that someone working at a famous Singaporean restaurant doesn't know the English word for "rice"? In the end, we finally go through to her because I happen to be able to write in Chinese characters the word for rice. Why were there bugs in the water? Why must I ask 4 times for a napkin? The food wasn't very good either. I had looked forward to the chilli crap for 2 weeks only to be gravely disappointed. The sauce was okay, but there wasn't much crab meat and it was extremely difficult to get at. If you're set on getting it anyway, don't wear clothes you want to keep. They WILL get stained. It's hard work and very messy. I know that's part of the fun, but when the service is bad, the price is very high, and the food is not particularly delicious, there's no "fun" in getting dirty too. One final complaint. Why must I enter my credit card pin and THEN sign on two different receipts? Magically, have all the rules of using a credit card changed, or could it just be that this restaurant is the pits? Just wondering
2
Wouldn't return. Place is overrated. Experience of having to crack a crab and barely eat anything is not worth it. Essentially paid $500 for a tea spoon of crab each, some rice and broccoli. The compliments are not complimentary so refuse them if you don't want peanuts. Do not wear white if eating crab!
5
I love coming to this place, and there are 2 sure things I would order - Pepper and spiced salt crabs and the steamed bamboo clams. Usually I would also round the meal with kang kong sauteed in garlic, some love it with sambal, and Yang-style fried rice, for those who need to sate the bellies. The service is always great, although one may have to wait quite a while, mainly because the restaurant is so popular.Prices can be high, but that seems to be the trend for great food in Singapore
4
Food great especially chilli Crab. Service ok but make sure you request outside table if wanted else they may put you inside even after a long wait. Better to book ahead. Price not cheap but food worth it.
5
Experienced eating chili crab for the first time. So delicious! What a party for the tastebuds! Highly recommend this place!
4
Jumbo's have the best chilli crabs in Singapore a must visit for seafood lovers also get the scollops YUM and some dipping bread one pot is enough for 2 people.
4
Excellent food !
Must try black pepper crab, fillet steak with black pepper sauce, chilli crab sauce with buns, fish in Penang sauce ...
Chilled mango sago pomelo is delicious !
Must go for a proper Singapore experience !!!
5
with an incredible pleasant night weather as a setting for this huge but familiar location i enjoyed
5
If you want an authentic Singapore seafood experience with delicious food and outstanding service, the Jumbo is the place you want to experience.
This place really does.get busy so I reccommend reservations as far in advance as you can make them.
3
I love hot pots and food here is very fresh. Live prawns, fish and crabs sweet and fresh, but prepare to spend at least $70.00 pax if you order live seafood. I gave 3 stars because of the price. Make reservations it gets busy after 7 pm
5
We took family visiting for 1st time to a Chili Crab/Pepper Crab meal on a Tuesday night and were surprised that we barely got a resv to get in. As luck had it we slipped in at 7pm a few minutes ahead of schedule. We knew what to expect with the price so that wasn't a shock and as always over the years in S'pore, Jumbo at East Coast is ALL Delicious. From the fried baby squid to baby Kai Lan in garlic on to Crabs, Sweet buns and on and on! Nothing was bad with the meal and the Staff were great! Very welcoming, friendly, helpful and courteous!Our sincere thanks to the Jumbo East Coast team!!!Look forward to our next visit
5
I like this restaurant because the food is very good. It serves good chili crab, black pepper crab, various seafood, and other popular local dishes. The fresh coconut water is delicious. You can sit outside and look at the ships in the harbour. If you have sharp eyes you can see planes in the distance making their approach to Changi Airport, although there is no noise. They do have seating upstairs with air conditioning if you prefer that. The food comes quickly, service is good. There is plenty of parking. This restaurant is very popular and always full
5
Went there without booking and got a table in 10 min. Recommend to be early for dinner as queue is building up fast on a sunny day. Sat outside and saw the sunset with ships on the bay outside. Great view. Food was fantastic. So was the wine selection. It is not fine dine, but more fore family and friends. Great atmosphere. We also tried large shrimps. very delicious. Plenty of tea with food. I would recommend to everybody if you like seafood. And for sure, we will be back
5
Visited jumbo thrice in the 5 days we were there . Crab lover . The chilly crabs are to die for . Mostly packed so might have to wait but it's worth it .
4
The food is nice espically the Chilli crab, try not to choose too haeavy one, choose those about 1-1.5kg per crab, the meat will not be too tough after cook.
5
A recommended restaurant to those who wants to enjoy fresh and delicious seafood in Singapore. Any food we order, so far always satisfy our palatte. Don't forget to try the crab, definitely yummy!
2
Terribly poor service although not particularly busy. Mediocre food reasonably priced had food been better
3
What a difference to the place years before. The food is goog expensive and the service is more like a tourist industrial place and not very welcoming
5
Nice food and nice service. Their Chili crab and black pepper crab are must try!! And the service provided is good too. Price is slightly higher if you are on Budget when Travelling.
4
During this trip, we decided to splurge on ourselves on the first day of this weekend food trip and just stick to the hawker good foods Singapore is known for during the remaining days. This restaurant surely lived up to our expectation of their crab and seafood dishes, as well as the $$$ signs from previous reviews...it is a consolation that we ended the day well after an early start of a long day of travel..
4
I must have been to Jumbo a dozen times and always come back for more. The best dish is ofcourse chilli crab although I would say all the preparations are very tasty. This one at the ECP has an amazing view and I always takes my guest. Suggest you opt for a seat outside in the open and you must do a booking in advance as this place is always full be in the weekend or the weekdays. Happy Dining
3
We had not been here for the past few years, mostly eating at the NSRCC or Dempsey branches, and we were surprised to find that quite a number of seafood restaurants have left, and Jumbo has now taken over an entire block.You have a choice of sitting in the air-conditioned room upstairs, or to enjoy the sea views and breezes on a fine day. We opted to sit under the awning outside and it was not too hot the entire evening.Service was good, and orders were taken within five minutes and the food began arriving within ten minutes. We had the baby squid, which was nice but could have been crispier and a bigger portion. This was followed by tiger prawns fried in a wok with salted egg. While the prawns were fresh and firm, it lacked a certain something to enhance the taste. Perhaps more curry leaves could be fried in oil and added. Anyway, it was the least favourite dish that evening. The mee goreng was very flavourful and tasty, as usual, with chunks of squid and prawns. This was followed by chilli crab, with fried mantou. I am not a huge crab fan, but even I enjoyed this dish. The crab meat was firm and fresh and the spiciness level was just right. It was not cheap though - a 1 kg crab came up to around $80 and a meal for two was $170, including soft drinks
4
We usually visit the East Coast branch of Jumbo. Unlike some other places Jumbo is not touristy though it is mentioned in many tourist guide books. It is frequented by both tourists and locals. Main dishes that we order are the chili crab ( a must have - but very spicy for non locals), jelly fish, steam fish, cereal prawns and fried rice. All dishes have been consistently good. In all the visits that we made we never had any complaints. Jumbo remains on our list of favorite restaurant
3
Nice food but very poor and unwelcoming service!
Clean 5/10
Food 8/10
Service 2/10
Value 5/10
When you get there with all rudeness they will tell you you've got 1 hour to leave.
5
If you wanna do chilli crab in Singapore dont go anywhere else but Jumbo. Excellent and tasty crab. Good Service and lovely ambience. Luved it.
5
One of my absolute favourites ... Service is slow but the food compensates for it! If I lived here I would be back every week!
5
I've been here many times and is always a treat dining at Jumbos. The chilli crab is my favourite and the sesame prawns are really good. The place is always crowded but the service is airways very prompt.
3
Staff is nice but very efficient driven. Food was nice, but not the best. I was travelling with a veggie and they only had a very limited amount of veggie dishes (not good, to his standards). Averaged price. Average food. Average service.
4
It is a BIG restaurant. Most seats are outside. The service and the clean table cloths were a good surprise in a seafood open restaurant that has 1200 seats.The food was really good.They give you aprons and gloves to deal with the excellent chilli crab
4
Jumbo is an institution in Singapore - it isn't cheap but you have a great meal there. They are famous for their chilli crab and their salted egg prawns are also pretty good.I have been to all the Jumbos in Singapore but East Coast remains my favorite
1
This restaurant is overrated, the prices are high and the atmosphere is noisy and crowded. We ate at the riverwalk jumbos inside so we couldn't even see the river as the inside section is sunken. The chilli crab was very nice but make sure you are sharing with t least two others. lol the meals were over priced but very generous in size. Definitely designed for sharing. Just be aware of this, we were not. The service was the worst I have seen. My Friend was just about to take a mouthful of crab when the waitress reached in front of his mouth and handed my some crab tools. The tables were so crammed in and they had trolleys in between they or us could not move. Be aware the peanuts and tea are automatically put on table but you have to pay for them. Say no straight away if you don't want them. Won't be going back. Much better to go to the underground subways for some really good and reasonably priced chilli crab
3
Unfortunately I didn't find anything that I really liked (but I'm just finicky). Sadly too I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND you make a reservation, otherwise you end up where we did (at the Riverside location) next to the staff's set area/walk in area. Which meant I couldn't talk to boyfriend, got bumped by the waitstaff going back & forth with dishes/glasses and trays and also by other guests coming through. But boyfriend was SO HAPPY with his chili crab that I dealt with it. And at least after enjoyed the walk around the water. Beautiful at night
4
A little too pricey but food is worth every single penny!! We heard of this place before arriving Singapore and just had to make our way here to try their famous chili crab. It was indeed their signature dish. The gravy was best with their bread.
5
Fresh , good food and good view . easy to find and good for relax with family .
Just carful for book place on holiday because alway full
4
We had the chilli crab, and it was absolutely awesome! The chilli sauce with the succulent crab was fantastic. The staff were very attentive, and we are so much! Great experience, and would recommend. 👍👍
5
Lots of people! Large Crabs! Good food!
Staff can be unfocused on you if you do not have a local to translate for you.
It can be challenging to get seats at peak hours.
4
It's service is really good.Fried Prawns with Cereal is very delicious,a dish of eight fat prawn,50+SGD.CHILLI CRAB is my favorite，79 SGD a kilo,珍宝海鲜在克拉码头沿岸，风景怡人。我们一家五口人去吃，点了麦片虾、黑椒螃蟹、油炸馒头、虾面和椰子水。其中麦片虾和黑椒螃蟹非常好吃。虾个头很大，50多新加坡元一份，一份8只。黑椒螃蟹好像是79新加坡元一公斤，好像。这一餐一共花了200多一点。

Great food, exotic to us North Europeans. Pepper crab and Tiger beer, recommend! Chinese efficiency put at work. Enjoyed the dinner sitting on simple plastic chairs, but you pay for the food, right!

My wife has crab as her favourite food and telling her Singapore is famous for its crab was one of the most attractive reasons for our visit. We were told Jumbo Seafood was the best. I ordered a 1.4kg crab for my wife and laughed when the large pile of cooked crab came out. There was a moment as she first tried it that I wasn't sure if she liked it then a look of total satisfaction came over her face. She said it was the freshest crab she had ever tried and that was about all I heard from her apart from the crunching of shell as the meal was destroyed.The crab was not cheap at $88 kg + however having a happy wife was well worth it. The other dishes were nothing special which is why I couldn't rate it higher but if you are after crab you must go here
5
Went to jumbo seafood at east coast. I like the chili crab very much. The seafood in singapore is better then hongkong. They kept their cooking level. The chili crab as good as 7 years ago.The shrimps are fresh and you must try the salted eggyolk shrimp
5
Jumbo restaurant at East Coast and at Dempsey's is just buzzing all the time, but you must book or you wont get in! jumbo's is not cheap but what an experience. Its a MUST for anybody who likes sea food alfresco, Its a pleasure just taking in the atmosphere and eating the best crab ever
5
The location at East Coast has something particular with the outside sitting with view on the bay and hundreds containers ships. Even more nice at night with a lot of light lighting . Great prawns , chili crabs ! Service a bit rude ! Nevertheless worth coming and enjoying excellent food dishes 
4
Great views overlooking the ocean. I thought some of the waitresses were a little to grumpy. We had chilli crab it was sensational cereal prawns were delicious... All other dishes were fresh and very enjoyable. Drinks were cold. Jumbo seafood is a lovely place for dinner 380.00 for 4 people with 3 jugs of beer. I would book to get a good seat out front or in air cond
4
Although here is quite expensive, I really love everything here. Specially, chilly crab is amazing. When I got my food, I though I can't finish all of those. Unbelievable, I ate all.
4
It is usually a mess to enjoy lobsters and crab. But because of disposable apron and gloves, we had full pleasure of eating sea foods. Chilli crab is not hot, but thick and tastey. Fish with lemon is also fresh and soft. Servings were quick.
5
What a meal. Two words....Chili Crab. Simply amazing.....on the water, plentiful outdoor seating, neon lights....the list goes on. Go here!
4
One of my favorite restaurant. Various choices for seafood. If transport is not a problem, it is good location for family outing or gathering.
4
Friends (locals) took us here on our visit to Singapore as it's a place they frequent. Whilst the food was very good we did find the waiting staff to be somewhat miserable. Saying that, we'd definitely go back on another visit to Singapore. They are well known for their Chill Crab but be aware that it does have peanuts in the sauce, something I (being allergic) only found out at the last minute! The chicken rice was amazingly tender; I could have eaten the whole lot on my own
5
The Pepper Crab here is out of this world. It's super pricey, but a real experience. We ordered the Atlantic Crab, which was HUGE, and had tough, wide claws. The only draw back with this crab was that the pepper flavouring didn't reach all of the meat. It was expensive - around $500 Australian just for the crab, ouch. The wine is pretty average too, so best to just have tea
4
I went here with my partner in Jan and it was very busy. Lots of locals and a waiting time was given for our table. It was about a 30 minute wait. The food was good but I did not try a lot of variety. Their signature crab was a little sweet for my liking but it was not terrible, I ordered a side of steamed buns and some noodles too. I would have to go back and try more dishes but I would say it's worth a visit for seafood lovers
3
thechili crab and the pepper crab is excellent albeit rather expensive considering that you have to wait quite a while to get a seat or to get your food. you can make reservations by phone - but then on a weelend nothing seems avaiable until late - but when u got there then you do get a seat... so its a bit confusing. good food but pricey
2
I was told about how amazing the prawn dish at this place was and that you had to order ahead because they almost always sell out. So I did that. What a waste. Bland flavor and the same is true of the other dishes I had. You get better food for far less money off a street vendor
5
I went to 2 branches of Jumbo Seafoodï¼šRiverside Point & Jumbo Gallery(The Riverwalk). I strongly recommend to ask a outside table when you go to Riverside Point but if you can book before you go there. You can see beautiful river view and enjoy your food .The most popular 2 dishes: chili crab and black pepper crab are recommend but I prefer to previous one
5
The Best Sea Food I ever Had. Very friendly staff, excellent food, excellent sauces.
Their presentation of Coconut water was also superb.
A must visit in Singapore.
4
it gets too crowded by night and customer service declines, we expect better services, lest this popular spot loses earnest customers...thank you!
4
I was invited to this restaurant by my relatives who are Singaporean. It was Friday evening and the restaurant was full house. Fortunately, my relatives booked tables in advance. I tried several different dishes and chili crab is still in my memory. It is so gravy and a bit sweet, different from those Cantonese cuisine.A minor comment is on the service. Chilled dessert was put on table even chili crab was being eaten
5
We have been going to Jumbos for many years now and the service is second to none in particular Jacki Chen always remembers us and always very welcoming.The seafood is just fabulous have not had any bad experiences .We would recommend this restaurant to anyone Chilli Crab most enjoyable.The service is second to none every one is so helpful can't do enough for makes you want keep coming bac
4
Sunday afternoon dinner with friends & their children - lots of seating both inside and out on the veranda with a good view out to the ocean. the menu had lots to chose from and the children were happy! The chili & black pepper crab were both excellent & highly recommended. The service was good, though the drinks took a while to arrive initially. Would recommend this place for an authentic location and a nice walk along the coast after dinner
5
First taste of Singapore's famous chili crab and it didn't disappoint! Plentiful options for seafood lovers, but not as many for the non-seafood types. Another must try other than the Chili Crab is the Mocha Ribs - my brother says he dreams of them they were that good!Grab a table outside (book in advance - strongly recommended) and be prepared to pay about $100 a head if you want a feast including alcohol
4
Reservations is adviseable especially during weekends or holiday .Always looking forward for the chill crab and the bun to dip the sauce .Good selections of menu .Cereal prawns is a must to try .Indoor and outdoor seating area.Great to stroll along the beach after a full stomach .Looking forward for my next trip
4
No one should come to Singapore and miss out on chili crab! Locals know there are better places perhaps and less "touristy" than Jumbo certainly. However, it is still a favorite and there are a few outlets at the key locations around town to at least not miss out completely. Let me tell you this, if you are not a lover of the actual crab, that's ok! It is actually more about the delicious gravy that it is bathing in. It is SO messy and SO much work to get the crab out of the slippery shells anyway. Move it all aside and get at that delicious chili sauce!! Get a side of rise to help get it in you. nevermind those useless little buns. They DO NOT sop up any delicious liquid heaven anyway. (best idea, bring your own bread! I have been toying with the idea myself for a long time) There is the famous chili crab and black pepper crab, if you are in a group try both!Service is fast, not very friendly. I think the service staff are chilly crabs themselves. LOL!DO NOT wear white or anything else you love, they provide bibs of course but really it isn't enough. They also give you wet naps, just one - it isn't enough come prepared with more and here is another tip, open all packages BEFORE you get in the pot! Enjoy!
5
This is a nice restaurant which sells mainly crab dishes. They have many restaurants in the city and their dishes are really delicious especially the chili crab :)We went to the Clark Quay branch, pricey but worth to go and try the famous chili crab dish of Singapore
4
The spicy crab is tasty with its sauce. Quite pricey for the price of one big crab approx SGD100 but for the quality it is ok. Not many choices of seafood, don't expect mantis prawn, abalone, shelf fish etc. Go early if you don't want to q for long
5
A restaurant serving great seafood. A popular and Lively place. Best to book in advance. Friendly staff and very helpful. Pepper crab is a must.
4
Probably the best cooked crab I have EVER had! the bibs provided are essential! This is not a restaurant for anyone wanting a 'smart' evening but perfect for a fun Asian night out and good for families.
3
I have to say I was really disappointed when I had chilli crabs here. The portion in JUMBO is big but also expensive. For me, the chilli sauce tastes more like Chinese tomato eggs, not spice at all.
4
This is the best crab place in town..and the costliest -our meal cost came to 360 dollars for 6 people ! I liked the pepper crab more than the chilli crab, which was a tinge sweet.
3
I was too excited to eat. And we initially ordered the original chili crab.. then gluttony came into picture.. we added the black pepper flavor.. then i realized we paid a lot.. there were other menus we ordered. But it was christmas then , so a little treat for working hard in foreign land. I do enjoy the bread that came with it.Now i remember an elderly woman.. who will not eat the chili crab if not cooked by jumbo restau. She refused her daughter's output of chili crab
4
Our team of 12 enjoyed a really good meal last week. All the dishes were excellent, though of course the crab dishes stood out. Sitting and sharing with the Tiger Beer flowing was the best kind of team building. Only 4 rating because the place was hot and sticky. We still had a great time though. Wear some casual clothes and pig out on the food
3
We went there to try their chili crab and satay. The crab was decent but it was almost a total of 100 singapore dollars, which is probably one of the most expensive dishes I have had in a restaurant. And if you compare it to the price, it was unfortunately not really worth it.The satay was extremely tasty and gave better value for money.The service could have been better as well as we had to repeat our orders to the waiters a couple of times.I recommend this place due to its location and decent food
5
Jumbo has always been one of our Favourite seafood chains for good quality food at good value prices. For family celebrations and other occasions you can't go wrong with Jumbo. Chilli crab is a perennial Favourite. Punggol Mee goreng is also excellent. In fact, most items in the menu are nice and well cooked. Highly recommended
5
I have tried many restaurants in Singapore for the crab, but I always return to Jumbo Sea Food. It is the one that has every dish a Signature Dish. Their Black Pepper Crab is a favourite. Almost all their dishes are terrific.For great chinese food, head to Jumbo. Please book in advance as all their outlets tend to be packed every evening.A tip-always order a big crab to enjoy great juicy flesh. The restaurant will normally tell you they are sold out, but insist on minimum 1 kg
5
It's been many years since we were last here, and it didn't disappoint. The signature dishes are the crabs -- with chili sauce or with black pepper. We ordered the chili crabs with mantou, and while we were waiting for the crab also ordered baby squid (crunchy and delicious!), baby kailan with garlic (always a good standby) and cereal shrimp (yummy). The crab was delicious, full of spicy, rich, wonderful sauce. As soon as you arrive, the wait staff provides you with a bib for exactly this reason. Make sure you wear it and get stuck into the crab
5
I have been to this jumbo seafood restaurant couple of times. The specialty is chilli crabs here.mits really delicious. Excellent food. Good service too. Definitely will visit this place again soon.
5
We stopped in here for dinner one night, as it was recommended to us. We had a great night eating outside next to Clarke Quay watching all the people go by. The Chilli crab was delicious, so was the rest of our food.
5
Jumbo always delivers. Took my son there and pepper crab and shark fin soup were cooked to perfection and served at the exact right temperature. Price is high, but restaurant is worthy
5
Along the seaside. Good place to enjoy the wonderful seafood especially the chilli crabs. Reasonably priced.
4
It was good to be able to eat outside and with a view over the water. The food was good although the top recommended fish meal did not taste fresh. Overall though we enjoyed the experience and will come back to try again.
4
Was a guest so don't know exact cost of the whole meal but did have a look at the menu and saw that prices are higher than average.
The food was tasty, fresh and yummy. Service was prompt and friendly. Great atmosphere for a meal.
4
One of those areas you just have to try as an infrequent tourist to Singapore - & we were very happy to find it wasn't outrageously expensive & that we weren't pressured to order more than we wanted. We ended up with a bill of around SGD100 for 2, enjoying plentiful chilli crab, salt & pepper prawns & 2 lots of scrumptious fluffy buns to mop up the sauce. A couple of beers too. The waiters were pleasant & attentive, & it was nice to be by the water which is very unusual in Singapore. Altogether it was more fun & better value than we would have expected, & there seems to be no trouble getting a taxi back afterwards.
3
Have a nice walk with friends we decide to stop a Jumbo for lunch. Not knowing that they would charge you for items on the table that most restaurant would have provide for their customer. The food however was good. I just do not like dinning at restaurant where you are not sure if you are being taken or not when dining
5
The best chilli crab in Singapore! Jumboo at Clark Quay -must book in advance, if not you will be disappointed. A must to try if you are in Singapore and also if you like spicy food.Alternative, you can ask for less spicy on the sauce. They use the fresh crab, the sauce is the best of all, you can either eat with the bun (steam/fried) or rice. It so appetizing and yummy. Besides they served other dishes like boneless chicken with fish paste, small cuttlefish etc
5
This location is the best of all the Jumbo Restaurants around town. Right on the ocean front, great views and sunsets. The food? Wow Delicious. Of course you have to order the Chili Crab. If Chili is not you then order the Black pepper Crab. Everything else in the menu is good. Order the Seafood soup you won't regret it. The Gai Lan with Garlic was the best I Ever tasted, anywhere.
5
Always full and you better make a reservation.
I liked specially the crab in chilli sauce and the salt and pepper crab
Just delicious
5
I have been to jumbos many times in the past. I haven't bee there for more than 10 years and I found it to be just as I remembered it, fresh, delicious and fun with friends.
5
I must have been here at least 20-30 times and it is still great fun. Loud , crazy with great service , spectacular seafood.
The crab dishes , chilli , pepper , salted egg are my favourites. Drunken prawns also.
A must in Singapore...
3
Our family tried the award winning chilli crab. It was very nice. We also ordered baby squid & stir-fried scallop. All the dishese were nice. It was good to eat next to the river. Certainly, something to try.
3
You get a great view of the east coast from sitting outside so I understand why it is a tourist attraction. The food was tasty although we felt that the crab they gave us didn't seem like one kilo as per order and receipt. Nevertheless, it was still a good experience
4
Arrive early - like 5-6pm. Get a table outside and soak up the seaside ambience with a cold beer and a plate of Chilli or Pepper Crab n some prawns. We spent $170sgd for 3, taxi driver thought this would be better than the Seafood place in Pagoda st chinatown. Excellent choice.Tip - use Uber for Taxis, Sing taxis are badly unreliable. Though if leaving say 8pm you will get a return from the dropoffs arriving
5
This restaurant is by far the best seafood restaurant I have been to ! It is famous for it's outstanding Chili Crab! As it is a very busy restaurant you do need to book in advance or look at waiting for around an hour ! The menu is great and you can choose a set shared menu with around 5 different dishes to serve four people ! Would highly recommend the shared dishes as you get to try everything and is very good value for money ! Also it is on the waterfront so beautiful views !

We've been around the Clarke Quay area several times and this place is always busy. Finally we gave it a try. If you want to pay $130 to be treated like crap than this is the place to go! We were seated relatively fast but then waited about 10 minutes to be approached by anyone. Server one brought us some gross hot tea that we didn't request (I thought it was complimentary since we didn't ask for it but apparently it's $2.50). I asked for two ice waters for my wife and I and received one glass of water with no ice. Five more minutes go by and I flag down server one and ask for an ice water. She gives me another glass of warm water, but before she walks away I ask why she isn't giving me ice (all the other tables had ice in their beverages). She doesn't respond and walks away. After about 20 minutes I was ready to walk out but server two approached and took our order. Twenty minutes later server three brings us our food and a bucket of ice (seems like someone was being a smartass). After being treated like a second class citizen for the rest of our dinner, we paid our $130 check and left and will never return. The crab was ok but not worth $70. The shark with crab meat was an $18 cup of soup, and both my beers were room temperature. The En
3
The food here is always of a consistent standard, but pretty much conveyor belt.The Chilli crab is good, but then it is in most places in Singapore.Seafood is good, but service isn't especially friendly - more of an eat and go experience than somewhere to spend a Long evening with friends.Worth going if you are close by but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit
3
Firstly, the services were bad. The waitresses were not friendly and provided wrong information so we ordered extra food for 2 persons. It is stupid to not serve satay before 5:45pm. We tried the black pepper crab which is really not up to Singapore standard. The one we ate a few years back closed, so we tried this one and was disappointing. There are many better restaurants for seafood
3
Service not fantastic food quite over price compare to portion but the taste is nice not bad long queie some time
5
The best chilli crab!! Make a reservation as they are always busy. Nothing better than chili crab and a tiger beer. Its a must when in Singapore.
5
Recommended by a friend and not disappointed. Whilst a half hour taxi ride from Shangri La Hotel well worth the trip.
Starter was duck, main peppered crab.
Both fantastic.
5
had the chilli mud crab and cereal prawn. Great meal, good service, nice view. Lying in bed now thinking mmmmmm money well spent...
4
I frequently visit this restaurant to have my chilli crab and sechuan frogs legs.
Unfortunately this last trip they no longer serve frog meat so had to do with chilli crab. Mopping up the sauce with the buns is a most enjoyablle past time.
4
Fantastic restaurant for seafood!! Pepper crab is a must try!! Overall a very good menu with several seafood specialities.
5
Always being my friends from all over to Jumbo at UDMC. The alfresco dining experience by the seafront is always welcome by all. Recommended menu on top of Chilli crabs are : bamboo clamps steamed with garlic. Drunken prawns, steam fish, lobster sashimi, fried Kang Kong
5
This is highly recommended for any seafood lover. My husband misses this taste for years after first time we have the Chilli crab back in 2008. Now we are back to Singapore for a family trip with our son, and this is the only thing that he will think about
4
Very good and fresh sea food place and we'll known amongst locals and tourists alike. Make a reservation. Try the chilli crab, one of the Signature dishes of this restaurant and of Singapore in general.Nice service, very hardworking, but not too at ease with English, so be patient
3
It's such a shame the service is disjointed, slow and rude. You have to deal with about 4 or 5 different waiters all of varying degrees of rudeness. We did have one older waiter who was fab and actually remembered what we asked for! The crab is excellent but no longer a great and fun dining experience. More of a tourist trap. Couple of better places to get chilli crab in Singapore which are more pleasant!
5
The best seafood in town
This restaurant has many branches in town. And it's very convenient for transportation. Recommended menu is chili crab (80$, 2015)
Ps. Please making a reservation in advance
4
Very pricey but one of the finest dining experiences if you are into Singapore Cuisine. Worth trying any dish on menu.
5
Great and efficient service, food is superb, albeit a bit pricey. Staff are friendly. We always go to Jumbo everytime we visit Singapore
4
Great chili crabs, price is very reasonable. I love the setting here as it has a view of the sea. This place really gets busy so do book in advance especially if big groups. Don't bother wasting your money in No Signboard.
2
I went there because I heard it's an old restaurant, have been in the business for 30+ years. Must be good.
Ordered several dishes which mostly tasted plain. And the price is not cheap I must say.
Won't come back.
4
Seafood is fresh and good, especially the Chilli crab is excellent, service is good and fficient. Staffs are friendly.
3
We came for dinner to experience chilli crab. It was good but not spectacular. When you are seated, peanuts are placed on the tables without asking. They are also added to the bill together with the dinner buns which accompany the crab. A small thing but cheeky. This establishment doesn't need to be so miserly as diners are already prepared to spend to eat here
4
I have lived in Singapore for 18 months now but still hadn't tried the iconic chilli crab dish so we thought it was about time we did it - we booked a table with another couple at the Robertson Walk Jumbo for NYE. It was fantastic - and delicious! I was really impressed. I'd never eaten crab like this before (having to crack the shells and extract the meat myself) but it was lots of fun and not as much work as I thought it would be. We ordered two crabs to share between the four of us which was more than enough as we also had one starter which we shared, as well as fried rice. Surprisingly, it also wasn't too hot - I'm not great with chilli so I was a bit nervous, but it was actually fine. The buns that they serve with the crab to dip in the sauce were unbelievable - one of the most delicious things I've ever had! And the starter we shared (scallops wrapped in yam baskets, kind of like a taro ball) were superb. It was NYE so it was extremely busy and we had to wait a little bit for our drinks, but there were plenty of staff and the service was good. The only two downsides that I can think of were that there were not enough wet towels/napkins (it gets very messy) - we were given one each but really you need at least three each. Also, we were only given one set of claw cracker utensils - my Canadian friends that we were with said that in North America each person would get their own set. Lastly, there were no bowls/buckets given to put all the cracked shells in (we just piled them on a plate). But apart from those small things, it was great. The only other negative was the bathrooms - there was only one bathroom downstairs in the ladies toilet and it was quite old and a bit dirty. Overall though it was a great experience and I would definitely go back
4
This is by far our good old favourite chilli crab place whenever we visit Singapore. O kay, it's also well known for their pepper crabs. On a balmy evening, the sea breeze is most pleasing coupled with the sea view. Although not as trendy these days, itâ€™s still pretty crowded & noisy at times but delicious local cuisine at reasonable prices. We went there early approx. 6.00pm before the crowd poured in
4
Jumbo seafood is located at quite a number of places but my favorite is at East Coast Seafood Centre. The seafood is fresh and they have quite a huge varieties of dishes. The chili and pepper crabs are worth mentioning. You may also try Mee goreng which is very tasty too. Be there at about 6pm to see the beautiful view of the sea and enjoy the night coolbreeze. Easily assessable by taxi only. Enjoy!
5
Excellent Chilli Crab with great service. We sat outside and it started to rain, the staff quickly move us inside. Will go back when in Singapore
3
The seafood is great, just too expensive! Service is so-so, They should introduce smaller portion at lower prices, as some portions are too large for 1-2pax.
4
Fresh stingray, cuttle fish sambal, baby kailan with oyster sauce, these are the usual meal I ordered with family and friends. Last saturday, my friend recommended me pepper crab, that was superb. Must try!
3
Good place to have dinner with family along the river/seaside Jumbo Seafood. I love the chilli crab and take it everytime I go!
5
I completely fell in with the seafood at Jumbo.....the Chili Crab is reigns supreme from any of the other restaurants. The staff are excellent and the view is spectacular. Going to Jumbo is my 1st stop after arriving to Singapore and I always order too much food just so I can have left overs.
3
The food was good, but spending a bit of time in Singapore and you can find less touristy spots for the same Singapore specialty. That being said, the Crab was really good and there was a lot of it! The view is great and the service was quick, though not very friendly. Not as clean as central Singapore either
4
The location is nice. If you are lucky and it is not raining, you may sit outside and enjoy the riverside music and colours. The food quality is good. But, the quantity is too much. If you are 3, take the set for two. It is more than enough..
5
If you visit Singapore, you should try Jumbo chili crab. I had fried rice which was my favorite and fried shrimp and chili crab. I liked the taste of fried shrimp and my wife is a big fan of chili crab. And I know most Korean enjoy this restaurant. They must eat Jumbo seafood but the reservation is not easy during holidays.
5
Tried their signature crab dishes. Absolutely awesome. Very nice and recommended. Meal can be pricy in local standards but worth it if you can do it. Had right dishes including two crabs, kang kong / veges, venison, sweet and sour fish amongst others was about $300.
3
A better Singapore seafood restaurant with a few branches, serve good chili or black pepper crab, drunken prawn, fresh stream fish in " teochew" style and many seafood dishes unique to Singapore only, good for tourist and local alike. Good food but nothing special... when mum is lazy to cook this is not a bad place after all.The downside: Very crowded, noisy, kid running around, people talking loudly, with all staff overwork and a drop in service standard during peak hours. This place is not cheap.. well maybe to be fair .. all so call "restaurant" or air-con eating place , even food court are never cheap nowadays!! Rental and staff cost is killing the business... for me the best food you can find in Singapore are in the hawker center,very cheap and unbelievable good food
4
Awesome seafood in great ambience right next to the beach... can't afford to miss if you love seafood. Prompt & courteous service & the restaurant is bustling with patrons so prior booking is recommended.
5
This is the place to bring friends for Chilli crab. The quality of food and service is consistent. It's always crowded though, better make a reservation or call before heading down.
5
We've been a couple of times to this place and even though it is big, it serves amazing seafood.
Whole crabs in butter, pepper or other ways. Attentive staff and fair prices (although crabs are never cheap -)
5
Everytime I go to Singapore, I always go to Jumbo Restaurant. I prefer the one in East Coast. Try chili crab and black paper crab. It's the best, recommended.
3
Just seafood, seafood and more seafood ! great place for a family lunch or dinner ! Do plan nothing after ur meal as this Jumbo is a place for u to not only eat , and also chill and catch up w family n friends.
4
Went on a Wednesday night and was amazed that the restaurant was absolutely rammed. Food was very good especially the crab.
5
Yummy Sea food... Very very yummy Crabs , Shrimp and lobsters.. Mouth watering food and amazing service.. Very lively place... Feels like one visit is not enough... A must visit place in singapore for the sea food lovers....
5
I come to Singapore every quarter on business. This restaurant makes the shortlist each time, as it is in a great location overlooking the bay, and while a bit on the casual side offers some of the world's very best seafood. Try the chili crab or black pepper crab, as they are very good, but for an additional treat try the drunken prawns - they're amazing. The service, however is average, and where the wait staff is a bit too efficient, the good news is that the food comes hot and promptly. I have taken probably a dozen guests there over the past 2 years, and we loved our meals each and every time. Can't wait to go back
5
This place serve the best seafood in Singapore. A little out of town but worth the travel. It is very busy. I suggest you make a reservation or wait a long time for table. The food here is fantastic. You can tell by how busy it gets. It's a huge restaurant and still always full. Definitely would go again.
4
A very famous and popular chain among both locals and tourists. It's almost like a Must-Do when you visit Singapore.Food is delicious no doubt, but relatively pricey compared to selected good suburban tze-char stores. But given the lack of absolute clarity where else you can go and the inconvenience in finding them, JUMBO serves as the best bet so far with multiple branches like East Coast, Dempsey, Riverside Point, etc.Note: Get their contact no. Via their homepage and make reservations! Saves you a lot of waiting time and /or disappointment. Book at least a week ahead, they are pretty often fully booked..
5
A dining delight ,a veritable feast , an amazing experience ,but a tad expensive , well worth a visit , superb meal .
4
Chilli crab is the best.
You need to reserve seat in advance, but sharing table with the others is a good choice. My friend and l got our seats very, very fast.
3
Been eating from this restaurants for many years with clients and colleagues. The food is good especially chilli crabs. The price is reasonable too.
4
A good place to come for seafood....highly recommended !!! Slightly expensive but no regret for the seafoods....it was good !!!!
3
Get messy, grab your crab in chilly or peppers... Very Singaporean, however there are plenty of other options on their menue. Slow service
4
Good seafood selections available. The big deal here is the chilli crab, appears a bit of a tourist thing as not many locals are tackling this project. Very tasty and understandable why it's their signature dish. Other than the novelty experience it's a lot of messy work for little crab meat obtained. However I had fun with this and enjoyed it heaps.Nice outlook across the water.Heaps of taxis available make it an easy transport from and back to hotel.Recommended for a fun dinner but a bit costly depending on what you have
4
I must admit, we've hardly eaten anything here more than the Chilli Crab and Sweet and Sour Prawns. But the Chilli Crab here is some of the best, and very consistent. I even pass on actually eating the crab itself these days and just order some steamed buns and sop up the chilli sauce. Paired with a few jugs of Tiger Beer and it's a must for anyone visiting Singapore. But make sure you get a reservation, or you'll be disappointed. Other reviewers say it's some of the best seafood in Singapore, which I don't think I'd quite agree with, but it's definitely good

Having lunch was great as we get good service with less customers around. The peanut were fresh and crispy. The fresh shrimps served steamed was refreshing and tasted very well with the dipping black soya sauce. The chili crab was fresh and superb with the mandou bread. The mee goreng was a nice way of winding up a good lunch. Overall our family enjoyed the lunch. A recommendation would be the chrysanthemum tea which I usually take but was not available at the restaurant

Jumbo at Seafood Center East Coast continues to be the best place to get rid of your chili crab cravings. Their pepper crab is a must try as well. Service is fast and efficient, with friendly and knowledgable staff. A must visit for anyone wanting to experience a Singapore food trip tradition - chili crab!!
5
Either their award winning Chilli or pepper crab are their most famous dishes and they are a great experience, if you are dining in Singapore you need to have this at least once. There is a full range of other Asian dishes from lobster and drunken prawns, one of my favorites to abalone in oyster sauce to t he more delicate flavors of steamed cod with diced chilli. Their slogan "bonding people through food" sums up the experience, a great night out
5
The crab incredible VERY YUMMY and taste and delicious. I ate there for supper and they open till late midnight. Last order was 11.30pm. And they still cooked very yummy food. The crab was BIG. And very cozy place to hangout and chat
4
The signature seafood restaurant. Food is delicious and fresh. Tourist pricing.
Suitable for all occasions.
2
It's crazy expensive. Compared to price food is plain not that delicious. Service was poor. We had to ask 2/3 times to serve us tge dessert item.
5
A bustling place with everyone talking and loving the wonderful seafood. Pepper crab is amazing, chili crab also good...great fish as well. Worth the trip out there!
3
Singapore chilli crab, nice sauce, tourist pricing which was to say not the cheapest.
The batter for salted egg yolk prawns were heavy in flour, weird texture.
Service was rushed, but queuing system worked.
2
Went for dinner and was utterly disappointed. On arrival we were served with peanuts and tea which we did not order, did not eat the peanuts or drink the tea. Thought it was complimentary but was charged when the bill arrived. The service was terrible and the cost for the crabs was ridiculous. The menus state the price as market price !!! Will never go there again. There are other cheaper places for crabs with much better customer service and pricin
4
I always enjoy my visits to Jumbo. Service is good and food is definitely outstanding. For the price, some may perceive as exorbitant, but once you see the size of the crab, it is worth it! The pincer is so big and meaty. More importantly, it is very fresh. I recommend chilli crab, baby sotong, seafood paste you tiao, mee gorang, drunken prawn and fish paste chicken.
5
If you love crab, dont miss this Jumbo Seafood. There are few branches Jumbo Seafood, there are located in all the tourist places. I went to East Coast branch. Normally, there's a long queue, but worth it!I suggest two dishes 1. Crab, there are various way of cooking, Chili Crab, Crab with salted egg yolk. They normally served with fried bun.2. Cereal Prawn , yumSingapore is quite a pricey place but for crab price, I would say it's very affordable for this huge Srilankan Crab.And after the meal, you still can roam around this area, East Coast Park is a 15 km along stretch of beach, youâ€™ll find ppl do cycling and roller bladers and all. It's very famous for BBQ place for local as well
3
Whenever we go to Singapore for business, the first choice for dinner on arrival is Jumbo's at the east coast outlet. The pepper crab and chili crab are great treats to be ordered. This time around, the service was very bad. Because of insects, we moved indoors and then the mess up started. It took us more than one hour to be served food and that was also in bits and pieces. One of the fish we ordered, BBQ Tilapia, never reached us and was consumed on the neighboring table. We got a pepper crab after lots of pleading. Anyways, it wasn't an excellent experience this time around. For the management of the restaurant, one bad review from the service point of view won't make much of a difference
5
This place has fantastic Chili crab and should be required eating by all who visit Singapore. Even better however we found was the black pepper crab. Just loved it. There are several locations but we went to the original on the water on the east side of town
4
Located in Clark Quay night life area, they were still operating until late at night! Just go there when you need to fulfill your hunger passion. For the price, we can't discuss about restaurant price in Singapore 😆
3
not sure why this place is so famous, their chili crab is quite average. Nice location but I don't think I'll go back again, I think there are better places
5
For the first timer, you may order chilli crab or butter crab. The restaurant also offers other type of seafood.
4
The menu Chilly Crab, Shrimp, Mango Dessert are delicious. There are so many chinese people from abroad eating this restaurant, fully booked. Therefore, it is a must to have reservation in advance.
5
love it. must try.
First time trying the pepper crab and I think the pepper crab here is better than the one in Dempsy Hill. The prawns in cereal is a must try as well.
4
To me, Chilli is meant to be spicy. Hot. The Chilli Crab is bit of a misnomer. It is sweet, starchy, eggy but delicious though. Having had this, a much better and more iconic dish is the black pepper crab. Far more delicious and tasty. But black pepper is really quite generic made with chicken, beef, pork loin, etc. Hence some smart alec found the chilli slot untaken and decided to make this iconic. I was at Jumbo in an afternoon where it was very pleasant simply because a popular restaurant like this was sparsely populated by three families with ourselves as one. The services was reasonable, not superlative enough that leaves a lasting taste in the mouth. We also ordered a drunken soup. But honestly speaking, there are better restaurants in Singapore that serves better Chinese food. I am curious to see how they will improve with the IPO money. :) Better food? I certainly hope so
5
Everything is fast, very professional staff, all carry smart order gadget, no waiters running around because all are organised perfectly. the food is taste very good and all sea food are fresh and good quality. Strongly recommended for sea food lovers.Suggest for guest who like to stay late for nice sea breeze, make sure order taxi by phone or Uber
4
Ever wonder why the whole stretch of seafood restaurants on the same row couldn't survive the test of time, yet Jumbo has been running out of tables every weekends? Well, it's no secret for a local boys like myself to vouch for their best chilli crab in town. Coupled with the idyllic backdrop of a sea front dining, plenty of tourists joint the locals alike came for this reputated dish of Singapore! Besides crab, drunken prawn is a must try and also Mee Goreng.. many also love the Deep Fried Baby Sotong that goes really well with cold beers. Came here many times and definitely will continue to come
4
Went there earlier in in 2015 with relative from the US and family members. It was a huge place which can accommodate a huge crowd, including bus loads of tourists. I'm not just talking about space, there were adequate number of attendants who were quite prompt. The food was good, and they offer other popular dishes, and the prawn rolls are a must-try. After dinner, you can take a stroll along the walkway which runs parallel to the East Coast beach. All in all, it was a hearty meal, with satisfied customers
3
Chili crab and pepper crab are the supposed must have items in Singapore. I tried them and I have to be honest, neither are for me. The Jumbo Seafood restaurant is by the sea and you can dine inside or out. We dined outside and that was fine. The service is not very friendly but okay. Chili crab and pepper crab are not for me. They require a lot of work to break open the crab shells to get to the crab meat. The process is messy and the results not very filling
5
Consistent good quality and reasonable price. Drunken prawn tasted nice as usual. First time tried fried chicken, juicy chicken with crispy skin. Ordered Steam cod but the portion a bit small.
3
We were given an outdoor seating even with prior reservation made. Other than that, it was satisfactory
4
I had a nice meal at Jumbo Seafood (expat location, not downtown). We had the chili crab, which is a must do. Food was great, service was OK (never got a refill for my drink). Coconut juice was delicious.
4
We went here late after an appalling experience somewhere else. Found a great laid back atmosphere dining al fresco by the sea. The food was great particularly the chilli crab. I will make this a regular Singapore haunt from now on!
3
Believe they are the largest seafood restaurant chain. I love their pepper crabs! For dinner you have to make reservations either for six or eight o"clock. They allow you two, but sometimes, one and a half hour for your meals.
5
The chilli crab is perfect
We love all the dish we order.
Limited time to enjoy. But as they serve very quick is acceptable.
4
It was as busy as usual and treated us as a typical tourist as usual. However, this time, a waitress was quite responsive and attensive. It is much better than the one in Clark Quay where the waiters and waitress throw dishes at you... A pleasant surprise at Jumbo Seafood gallery... Will only go here from now on
4
Four of us have a great time at Jumbo Demsey mainly due to their attentive service and great seafood. We order two crabs (medium size), one chilly and one creamy butter. Both ways of cooking are yummy and worth trying. Also we have bamboo clams which I felt that this dish should not be missed whenever you visit jumbo. Also we have Mee Goreng and homemade beancurbs. All delicious and great taste
3
Food serve was quick and the requested stuff were well provided but the staff did not seem happy at all - did not seem too much negative though. I just want to say if they can show more smiley faces, that would make the customers more satisfied with their services
4
Everything is as per Jumbo's standard, the excellent food and the friendly staff. However, I would hope Jumbo can review its membership card program. I guess many of the members may be similar as I am who sometimes forget to bring the membership card. Unlike most of the other merchants where IC or mobile phone can be used to identify the membership, Jumbo seems to have issues in facilitating such work around.. 
5
Unbelieveble, so many people are eating here. The food is great, right at the harbour with nice weather. Awesome experience
5
Had their best seller chili crab, it was soo good. This place is always packed. The only negative thing for me is that you have to share tables. But not a big deal! This place is very recommended when you visit Singapore Clarke quay.
4
We had visitors from Australia, India and Germany. One of them requested for Jumbo. Once again the food didn't disappoint and we all enjoyed the 2 types of crabs - chilli and salted egg. Other dishes were equally enjoyable especially the fried seabass.
5
Apart from excellent ambience, the quality and portions of seafood were excellent!! very flavorsome, a great memory of singapore to take home from in terms of gastrocnomics!!
5
Very expensive,but you can try!food is very good,if I come back to Singapore,I will go to jumbo again!
5
I love Jumbo seafood at East coast. It is absolutely perfect seafood restaurant for get together. We had chili and pepper club, prawn coated by cereal, crunchy baby squid, Mee goreng, and sambal water spinach. After feast you can walk around the park along the ocean to burn off what you eat. Great ambience. They provide water to wash fingers and wet tissue but I suggest to take some tissue paper and wet wipes
4
Came here just to have the crabs. Had 1 chilli crab and 1 pepper crab. Also had 20 mantou buns for dipping and carbs, 2 soft drinks and 2 jugs of beer. Cost over $250 for 2 adults and 2 children. Left very satisfied and glad I wore the disposable apron that they provided, coz it was yummy mess
5
Been here a couple of times and loved it! This is a very popular place where people que to get a table, so make sure you have a reservation if you are bigger group. This is not a fine dining place so the portions are huge! Order that chilli crab and get your hands dirty! Good and fast service as well
4
No doubt on the taste, it's so delicious! We ordered crab and fried mantou. Needed to queue for a while, but they managed to find us seats within 10 minutes. Great view facing Clark Quay River. Staffs are friendly and helpful.. but the price is e.x.p.e.n.s.i.v.e
5
on return from bintan our ferry was late because of fault in one engine. so we missed last bus and decided to go by taxi. on route we stopped for dinner at Jumbo sea food. great experience with excellent food. we ate fish with mango sauce and rice
5
i visited riverwork branch. it was walking distance @10mins from riverside branch
view was beautiful
serving was fast and gentle
taste was really good!
5
Great restaurant. Good buzz. The Crab was to die for. Service was excellent and location even better.
5
Go there for dinner at NSRCC ( branch ) , outside is fish pool and inside the restaurant place is big , butter crab is big and very nice , cereal prawn was delious and portion of other food also big . The service is great . Really worth for money to eat there 
3
Singapore was added as a detour on our trip to Thailand, and the Jumbo was a detour on our stay in Singapore. This ended up being a reasonable to good standard Chinese restaurant, but the star of the show, the iconic Singapore Chilli Crab was distinctly underwhelming.From the moment we arrived, the first two of a table of seven, the service was less than relaxed. We were encouraged to order food before our friends had even arrived (which we resisted), but it set the tone for the evening... the black suited waitresses (the only people authorised to take orders) were ever-present when we didn't need them, and out of sight when we did.But to be fair the food was of a reasonable standard, with the prawns fried in cereal particularly good, but the fact remains that my wife's version of the Chilli Crab knocks this into a cocked hat — in hers the chilli and ginger take the lead over the sweetness, and the sauce simply sings — whereas here the sweetness wins out and the sauce has the cloying texture of overuse of MSG.In short, don't fly half way round the world for it, and even think twice of the journey out of town from Singapore... the view of the tankers from the coast does little to improve the experience
4
Chilli crab was nice, but more msg than fresh garlic and ginger. Prawns in cereal was better. Waitresses weren't exactly rude, but sullen and generally unhappy looking! I expected more. It makes me feel good about my Singapore chilli crab, which takes me less than 10 minutes to make once the crab is boiled
4
Very good seafood restaurant in the middle of East Coast Park with nice outdoor terrasse. The restaurant also provides an air-conditioned room on the second floor. Great razor clams, superb prawn sambal, great scallop and spicy cod! Good venue for lunch and dinner away from the busy city center. Children welcome.
5
You need to make a booking or be prepared to wait although their table allocation system works well. You do feel a bit rushed but it is very popular. Tastiest crab ever. You will only need 1 crab between 2 or more as they are huge. With rice and broccoli we had our fill
3
I was eager to try the famous chilli crab, and even managed to book a table online before we left home. On our previous trip we ate here, and felt it was a good reliable choice.We had a riverview table and were able to see the river and the passers by, giving the table a sense of vibrancy.We settled on a chilli crab and some barbecue prawns, and a few beers.The crab arrived, but without any buns. We noticed other tables getting buns, and even the table next door actually got seconds.As for the prawns, well they didn't turn up at all.The crab was great, it was spicy, and rich and tasty, but I can't help but feel that the food was overshadowed by the failure to get our order right.So, probably not rushing back here anytime soon
5
My friend has been urging me to eat in Jumbo restaurant everytime I would go to Singapore. Finally, I decided to go there for lunch. The branch I went to was the one by the river in Clark Quay. There is an open area & an airconditioned area. The waiting staff all looked busy but were friendly. I decided to sit inside as I will be trying the famous chili crabs..... MY! My friend was right! The chili crabs was so delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked! I devoured the crab with gusto and even wiped out every last bit of sauce off the pan with the tasty bread that came with the crab. YUMMY! I ordered a noodle dish & a tofu dish that was equally deliciously prepared. I stuffed myself so much that I was afraid my pants would POP! I would definitely return here in my future trips for more of the yummy crabs & would tell all my friends to add Jumbo restaurant in their itinerary. I rate Jumbo restaurant a 10++ 
1
Made reservations on Saturday for 5 persons. Arrived on time but was told to get in line and wait - then why bother to accept reservations? Absolutely no clue on running a restaurant. They tried to accomodate but it seems that they are not able to cope. The attendant at the entrance giving out pieces of queue paper probably need more coaching. Foodwise, used to be much better. It is now tasteless.Even the chilli crabs in the food centers (hawker stalls) taste better and most provide better and more personal service.It is a shame.
5
Facing The Sea this crowed Branch of The famous restaurant chain warmly welcome you in a beautiful atmosphere between video screens showing Crab chefs Working And amazing crabs served At any table. Good Price, confortable parking, booking recomended
3
Really enjoyed the food! Best chili crab in Singapore! However, the waitress was slow and forgot our order.
3
Abalone overcooked and too salty. Scallop with asparagus too bland. House wine is no good too.......
4
the food is tasty but sometime the waiters kept talking with other staff, we were ignored for few times
5
Very fresh and tasty seafood. Strongly recommend the black pepper crab, steam bamboo cram and BBQ fish. You wont regret!
5
I was a bit reluctant to try this place initially and went to No Signboard instead, which I bailed out when they tried to push a $450 Alaskan crab to me (refer to my review of No Signboard 8 Raffles avenue branch).Back to Jumbo, no booking required when I arrived at 8.30pm and I chose the 2nd floor aircon seating. They asked if I wanted the tea and appetiser before placing it down which I kindly declined (unlike the other place).Ordered the Chilli crab and Black Pepper crab, and the waitress also made sure if I was ok with the 800g size of each crab - that was thoughtful, and they didn't even try to upsell me to the premium priced crabs that they also sell. Also ordered wasabi honey pork ribs and cereal prawn. As I wasn't sure of their serving size I tried to order the medium size dish, but the waitress told me that the Small size dish would be more than enough for the 2 of us... Nice touch....The food came and I finished everything with to my delight, and my wife who isn't a crab eater shared the crab with me saying it was awesome ! The crabs at 800g each was perfect for sharing between the 2 of us. The crabs were cooked to perfection and the meat were succulent to the bite. The pepper crab was peppery spicy and I liked the taste pretty much, while the chilli crab was a bit sweet initially, the chilli kicked in later on which was quite hot. Finished the chilli sauce with mantou bread for dipping into the sauce. Perfect !!!I also bought their chilli and black pepper packs to bring back with me back home. Overall, a delightful experience, and at the time of my writing this review, I already went for a second time in my 3-days here in Singapore. I can vouch that the quality of the food and service is consistent in my 2 times dining in Jumbo
5
If you want to go to Jumbo Seafood at Clark Quay it is best to make a booking, otherwise be prepared to wait up to 1 hour. The wait is worthwhile especially the Chilli Crab and other seafood. It is best to go later in the evening by 8:00pm as it is not that busy and best to go during the week as it gets very busy by the weekend.
4
If it's crab you crave for, Jumbo is the perfect place. Come here ready for a lazy lunch of crab and golden fried buns washed down by pitchers of Tiger, all by the sea. Try the Black Pepper crab or the Chilli crab but plan in advance since this place is open between 12.30 and 4 on Sundays and in the evening on others
5
Nice sea food restaurant located on East coast bang on sea shore. Jumbo is chain of restaurant in Singapore and China with 5 sea food restaurants in Singapore. They give Chinese tea as welcome drink which has good flavor. We were here for Dinner after long business meeting and had wonderful sea food dishes. They serve hot and tasty food to meet your needs of taste buds. Crab is very nice with good preparation and tasty. They give tools to break shell and take out meat so that one does not have to depend on teeth. Each person is provided with apron to wear so that one does not spoil clothes. Food is expensive but enjoyable. One can find cheaper sea food restaurants in city but one can not get such ambiance. Must visit if you are in Singapore
2
If you go to Singapore, everybody will tell you about this place... Normal! It's a tourist attraction!!! And only that! Seafood is a common food in Singapore and you can have better quality for a much better price than in Jumbo!!! The quality is not that good and prices a very high... Not a place that I recommend at al
5
Despite being late for the appointment timing, the staff still managed to get a table for me. Service and the food are fantastic!
3
most of foods on the menu are not availiable because last night was sold out...
what kind of management was that...
4
Enjoyable dinner at Dempsey branch.
Our friend from Australia enjoyed the food very much especially their chilli crab.
Their staff service was good especially the Auntie who took care and served our table. She was very careful and attentive.
5
Singapore is best known for chillicrabs and Jumbo is the best place to eat Chillicrabs in different flavours.. Although expensive than the local food court, the food is just worth it....Plus the view from the restaurant is good.
3
very busy restaurannt where food is ok to good but very overpriced. location is good i suppose overlooking the sea . we sat outside full inside so was very hot . its also a bit out of the way if you are in the city so add $15 each way for taxis which may not be easy to get on return journe
5
Fantastic. Should be enough said but Trup Advisor demand a minimum. Fantastic Seafod, you just yet the Singapore Signature Chilli Crab, please do not be put off by 'chilli', yes it's warm but it really is tasty and very manageable. I enjoyed having my millionth discussion about Tom Yang soup being hot, we do HOT in the UK you know lo
5
This is the place for Curry Crab! Catch a cab to Seafood Centre at Singapore's East Coast and have a fabulous meal, looking at the sea, with a wonderfully fresh and tender crab in a thick, yummy and spicy curry gravy! (and don't forget ordering a few buns to finish up the gravy )
4
This was my first time to this restaurant, visiting on business from the US. The view of the sea is nice and if you look over the railing you see the tiny beach in front of the restaurant. The water helps to give a cool breeze to reduce the outside temperature a little. The menu selection is large and the crab (chili crab and salt crab), sweet and sour pork and noodles were very good. I'm sure it is a bit of a tourist spot but it was enjoyable and I'd certainly eat there again. Service was good
4
Jumbo sea food- it's a nice food joint on the eastern part of Singapore . It's located on the coast with a nice view to sea where we can see a lot of ships at anchor. You can enjoy nice food here with seafood speciality. Choice in vegetarian dishes are limited. Nice crab dishes are worth trying. One limitation to this location is the congestion-it's crowded with tabled arranged very close to one another. It's advisable to book table in advance (especially if in larger group
5
Excellent sea food. Never for get the ambiance. Excellent setup. One can seat outside, have a feel of the sea side.. and order.Must try is the Black Pepper crab items. The price is not in menu, you can ask for the same as it varies due to size of the crab. Approximately a dish will cost anything above S$60. Its value for money
4
Going to East Coast Seafood for black pepper crab and chili crab is a required part of any visit to Singapore. Twenty years after living there, the food is still amazing and the service is still as indifferent.
4
Their Chilli crab, despite so many years ... It still taste the same and yummy! Cons; weekends are busy, so don't expect the staffs to pay much attention to you.
4
Good service, friendly staff but I was a bit disappointed by the quality of the pepper crab I had. The sauce wasn't very rich and the crab itself a bit watery.
5
chill crab is so good，i like the
view along the river，we enjoyed ourselves in this amazing place，feel so good
4
I enjoyed your service and food. Every crew was very welcomed.
But it took long time to enter and check my bill.
5
I really love this place. Atmosphere is quite hectic but they do what they do close to perfection!!
Super place.
5
Came here with family this past May. We sat outside and ordered a ton of food. The most memorable of which was of course, the pepper crab! There is nothing better than a delicious crab and a tiger beer while in Singapore. The pepper crab was absolute perfection!
4
Our son took us to Jumbo Seafood. He ordered us a crab each which came with all sorts of instruments to crack open the crab and to scrape out the meat. Son told us to suspend normal table manners, get stuck in and get messy. The restaurant provided bibs, wet wipes and bowls of water. It was great fun, we got crab all over us. It was impressive to see to many Chinese and Asian families eating there with quite small children conquering their crabs without making as much mess as we did! We had the chili crab which was gorgeous. The staff were rushed off their feet but very attentive. The restaurant was quite atmospheric, on the coast with a line of lights on the horizon of the sea. We thought it was another island but was queues of ships waiting for their turn to get into the port. Will recommend for the location and the atmosphere, it was an amazing experience
5
When you are in Singapore, trying chilli crab and black pepper crab is a must, as these 2 dishes were invented in Singapore.And Jumbo chain is the best place to try these authentic Singapore dishes.Jumbo is a chain of restaurants. Each restaurant represents the same variety of food. Prices are moderate, however, the taste and the quality of food are exceptional. The locations are different, but each is worth visiting.My favorite locations are:- East Coast Seafood Village;- The Riverwalk;- Dempsey;- Riverside.Besides crab, there are many other yummies to dig into, e.g. Bamboo clams, prawns (please pay your attention to egg yolk deshelled prawns), steamed fish Hong Kong style (with light soy sauce).Should your friends or family don't like seafood, there are meat dishes in the menu, too.Wines are simple, but good enough to accompany the perfect dinner, which, I believe, you will enjoy every time you visit Jumbo seafood
4
For business dinner, we attended this restaurant spesifically for their famous chili crab. There are 30 of us sitting at 3 table. The flow of food was very quick, service was attentive and catering to our needs. What we like is the atmosphere of the whole restaurant is very vibrant lively, thus we can chat, and even conversate with other tables.The chili crab is surely delicious and live up to the expectation, with the fried buns to dip into the gravyFrom total 9 course menu we ordered, none were disappointing
4
We had the mango & duck salad and crab - chili and pepper crab.
The food was good, especially the pepper crab.
5
Always great to come back to Jumbo Seafood. Try to come by every time I pass through Singapore. Classical landmark...great seafood...friendly staff and just a great spot next to the canal.
2
Bad service, very expensive and food overall.The restaurat was crowdy and the waiters do'nt pay attention. This place is a tipycal for touris.
4
Strongly comment you must book on line before going to eat, cause so many people wait on the scene. Spicy crabs and shrimp are really fresh and delicious.
3
There's a fresh crab
But the price is not cheap
And the service is not good
So I think it's can be better
3
Food is lovely. Pepper crab always a firm favourite Hong Kong noodles great.The issue is service. Food slapped down in front of you if you can find a waiter willing to serve you.So many staff in the restaurant but they all have there jobs and none of those jobs is to serve you
5
If I'm fortunate when in Singapore, I'll make it out to Jumbo on the East Coast for a black pepper crab dinner. It never fails to be delicious, particularly if accompanied by Tiger Beer. East Coast is one of the places on Singapore where you feel you're actually on an island. With soft sea breezes on a warm night, you're in a little bit of seafood heaven. All of that said, be prepared for rather perfunctory service. Jumbo has their own system; you're never quite sure who is going to bring food next. The last couple of times I've ordered rice and never received it. I don't know if that is a communication problem on my part, or an oversight on their wait staff. But, that's not a big deal if you can enjoy your crab with some prawns or other delicious seafood. Who needs those carbs? Next time in Singapore, I'll definitely be heading there again. Call for reservations. You'll need them
3
We were really looking forward to a chilli crab dinner but needed some help ordering. On their advice we had an 800gm crab for two, with one serve of steamed buns and a single serve of rice. Almost nothing is priced on the menu, and my partner ordered the house white wine. The crab was in our view far too little, and the wine really expensive at $14 a glass. Would have avoided that had we known. At the end of the meal we tried to order an entree, but this was out of stock. So we gave u
5
If you are craving for the Singapore's famous Chilli Crab, then you must definitely dine at Jumbo! Prepare to be delighted with a wide spread of seafood dishes and indulge on it. Useful tip: make reservations days ahead your visit because it is always full. It can seldom accomodate walk-in guests.
4
Loved it here. Was with 11 others so the ordering was done by two locals. The fresh fish is sublime. I usually eat shellfish but here you can taste how good fish is. The crab was a sight for sore eyes. Lots of beer and fun. Highly recommende
5
Our go to place for every important occasion of celebration. Taste is consistent and value for money. Nice atmosphere to celebrate birthdays.
3
We went here with a group of six. The meals were nice enough but one meal simply didn't arrive and it took ages for a replacement meal to come meaning we missed our boat cruise so pretty annoyed.
2
While requesting a table for the family, the waitress asked the SLEEPING kid to come to the seat with strong attitude. I understand they have to do the business but I don't have appetites any more at this restaurant. Business isn't all about making money.
4
This is a busy place which is known for its chili and pepper crabs. Both are great and you will not be disappointet if you like crabs, chili and/or Black pepper.Go for the menus. This way you will also experience other interesting items from the 'chinese' cuisine.But the main attraction is the crabs and they do not disappoint
3
We chose the curry cracked crab as our main entree...we heard so much about this delicacy available in Singapore. We decided that the pepper flavor would be too "hot" and went with the curry flavor. The sauce was good...the crab was so-so. The menu notes that it is crab with roe. I think the meal is over-rated...and over priced. We are from N. California and have Dungeness crab in Fall and Winter. I think that the Dungeness is much meatier, and richer in flavor and can be served in a curry sauce. The vegetable dish and fried rice we also ordered were both very good...as was the local Tiger Beer. The crab is priced by gram. Our dinner cost about $50 USD per person
4
If you are a lover of seafood. u simply cant afford to miss this out. Yummy mouth watering dishes.Being on the ECP, it provides a splendid view of the sea and the ambiance . Be prepared to spend an hour here at-least. Its a fully packed up place
4
Since arriving in Singapore over a week ago I have been wanting to try Chilli Crab, everyone I spoke to here said to go to Jumbo's. Finally got there for lunch, as we didn't have a booking they put us on a table with other people that also didn't book which was fine. We were shown to your table given a menu and befor we even got to open it they were waiting to take our order just felt intimidated by the waiter.However the Chilli Crab was lovely worth being hassled for. When we arrived sitting on the table were little bowls of peanuts and hand wipes, when the bill came we were all charged for them which we didn't ask for and thought they were complementary.Ask the market price for the Crab when ordering mine was $62.00 for 800 grams

So it's a frequent tourist spot and they try to shorten waiting times by warming up pre-cooked crabs out of the fridge. Well they should at least try to make sure that it's done properly- our crab was COLD. Epic failfor $70++. The sauce is hot and very tasty,so the net effect was just about passable. Jumbo at Sentosa is much better, we've been there twice as well, crabs are freshly prepared

My wife and I ate here based on the recommendation from our private transfer driver. Being in Singapore we weren't heading back home without tasting Singapore's famous chilli crab!The dining experience was disjointed. It took us a while to grab staff attention to place our orders. After having placed our orders, our serving of broccoli and rice came first before our chilli crab which we thought was unusual. They forgot to bring our bottle of wine and we had to ask again where our wine was!Above all, our crab was tasting and well worth the wait. The price we paid was SD58 for a large sized crab which we thought was reasonable. The only let down to this place was the service!We would definitely recommend this place to anyone who would like try Singapore's famous chilli crab!

Nice food. Had Chilly Crab and sea food rice.Rice came out about 10-15 minutes before the crab so was cold by the time we got the crab. I asked for a fresh one but he wasn't keen on replacing it. So we had crab and cold rice.Staff were very hard to attract over. Often had to wave or shout for service.In a country so humid they don't do jugs of water just small bottles of water. I'm not a big alcohol person so like to drink least a jug of water with my meals. I wouldn't recommend this place.

First of all,
We really really enjoyed our meal to you.
TKS for a great evening.
I hope to visit U again soon.
5
foods are great, but it is a little bit expensive. I love the lobster.it is great.
Hopefully I can come here next time!
4
The restaurant was crowded during the time of visit. Seafood was fresh and taste good especially the crab. We loved the chillies crabs very much and the staffs we were offering great service and polite.

Chilli crab at Jumbo was said to be tops in town. It's OK, but better crab is common and it's pretty pricey. We couldn't get reservations on the website, nor could the hotel, and they (the Quincy) are really good. However, we didn't want to miss the reputed "best", so we just went anyway, and found no line and were seated immediately.
5
I went in 3 different locations of Jumbo during my stay and was not disappointed in any of them even if I had to queue each time to get it; this one is far away from the center and while the bus drive was interesting, it would have been easier to go again on Clarke Quay; this is bigger location, open front to the sea, nice view on a long line of ships; food is delivered pretty fast, quality is better than average and really appealing, but you should expect 50-100sgd per perso
4
make sure you come on time and place your order right away. Maybe even decide beforehand what you are going to have for dinner. This makes sure you don't get into a rush and conflict with the waiters who want to prepare your table for the next set of guests. Enjoy
2
The restaurant was recommended by our travel agent as we all love seafood. While the food itself was fine the establishment could work on its staff: attitude and delivery of service was interesting to say the least. A drink order was missed, a meal order was missed and one plate of food was almost 'frisbeed' in front of me to my partner leaving a streak of seafood sauce on the cloth. When we inquired about the late meal the response was a grunt. Can't help but feel that the restaurant is busy enough that personal effort is no longer required
4
I really enjoyed dinner at Jumbo seafood. Food was good and prices were reasonable.This restaurant is the original Jumbo seafood, the first one that has been opened. I enjoyed it also because is in the East Coast Park, much more quiet than Clarke Quay.I would recommend to try this restaurant
5
A very busy Friday night so good we had a reservation. We were seated quite promptly. I have read some negative reviews of Jumbo but when I look at how many customers they serve then I think odds are someone might not get what they want. They are massively popular. We had chilli crab, black pepper crab, mango duck, seafood fried rice,yam scallops, wok fried prawns in an egg batter, fried buns and a few drinks. The (mud) crabs were fantastic. It is a luxury meal at about $67 each 900g crab but great. These crabs were the best I've had.All the other dishes were very good. The scallop dish could have been a bit tastier. The duck was cheap, perfectly cooked and sliced. That was a cold dish. Service was very efficient. There was a beautiful breeze coming off the water. Lucky day I would say
5
Jumbo's was touted as being the best Chili Crab in Singapore, and yes it was!!The place is busy and noisy. But the food was delivered very quickly. It was full to the brim with a large line up growing by the minute, just shows how great the crab was
4
Fabulous Black Pepper and Chili Crab, excellent selection of side dishes and other seafood offerings. Bring your appetite!
4
My friends took me there for seafood. Tables were booked in advance because the group size was pretty big. I liked their crab preparations named a Chilly crab and pepper crab.
3
I have tried crab at Jumbo which is so nice, but the price paid for the food is so expensive compared to other seafood restaurants
5
Like it, food is good. We order C set plus a fish. Quite good. Crab is spicy and fish is steamed. ...
4
We decided to take friends for some Chilli Crab and ended up at Jumbo Seafood at East Coast.We sat outside and the evening was beautiful and temperate and we could see the ships out at sea.We ordered 1 chilli crab, prawn in salt and pepper batter, seafood fried rice, green vegetables in oyster sauce and crispy chicken. Sipping on Sauvignon Blanc to wash all of that down it was a delight. Service was reasonably efficient although we did order glasses of water which we never received.The food was really well prepared and the chilli crab lived up to it's reputation!I would certainly bring overseas guests back here. A thoroughly enjoyable night
4
Wonderful restaurant at Clarke Quay to try SIngapore's signature Chilli Crab with the bun. But there is always a long wait. I went at 9pm and still had to wait 40 minutes before we could get a table for two. Plenty of bars around to drink something and wait for the table though. Service at this branch is average
3
The food overall is vwry tasty especially the little buns and the trademark chilli crab. Pricrs are slightly on the higher side (mind you everything in singapore is at the higher side so this goes higher than that). Reservation is a must even on weekdays as it gets easily packed. Service is fast and accomodating. Ideal place to take guests to.
3
Decided to fill a lengthy stopover with a trip to Jumbo for dinner. Chilli and pepper crabs, prawns etc. All great at the time but a couple of people reported later tummy issue - could have been one of a number of place though...Still worth a visit - fast, efficient and tast
5
I read that this restaurant has one of the best Chili crab in Singapore. I ordered the Chili crab and the pepper crab. Those 2 dishes were the culinary highlight of my trip. My friends thought that the spicy Pepper crab was even tastier than the Chili crab. Very friendly staff. Very nice outdoor eating facility. I love this restaurant!!
5
You must book especially for dinner and during weekend.They serve wonderful giant crabs. Chili or Pepper crab. Both are terrific. I'm not a seafood lover but each time I'm traveling to Singapore, I'm going to Jumbo.I recommend the place to all my friends and colleagues
5
Very good restaurants for seafood as drunken prawns and chili crab as well as black pepper crab and deep fried fish!
5
Unbelievable! It was packed, we had great service considering it was f1 gp weekend, they found us a table and we had the best chilli crab I've ever tasted!
Thanks! We will be back
5
It is sooo tasty. I visited this place with my friends. We ordered chili crab and peper crab. I have never tried the same tasty food. Personal is very polite and everything is very orginized.
5
a staff was very flexible and promptly gave us seats.
meal was delicious and atmosphere was nice. service was speedy.
5
My girlfriends and I attended Jumbo at Boat quay on a Sunday evening without a booking. We were kindly asked if we would like to share with some other patrons. The food was quick to come out, service friendly and and most certainly delicious!I will most certainly return for the chilli crab and black pepper crab
4
tis place full of people during dinner time. reservation is a must to avoid long waiting time. de restaurant view was sea view wiv a lot of container ships passing by.de service is quite good & attentive. overall de foods quite ok & price quite steep compare No Signboard restaurant
5
I love the pepper crab of this restaurant. The black pepper sauce is perfectly match the mud crab. I would fly over here from Hong Kong just because of eating the pepper crab. Other seafood of the restaurant also very delicious such as the butter tiger prawn. Highly recommended
5
This branch open longer hours than other branches, which gives chance to go in between lunch & dinner time to avoid crowded hours. Best shark fin & chilli crabGet ready to get your hands dirty.Please note that everything on the table is charged like wet towels, green tea, and peanuts. You can ask the waiter to remove all if you dont want to have extra charge. Bring wipes to clean your hand after tasty meal
5
Don't leave Singapore before you try the Chilli crab at one of the Jumbo Restaurantsin the Clarke Quay area. Make a booking before you go as they are usually booked out. The service was really good when Pam and I went , they even supplied an apron or bib as the crabs are a bit messy to eat, but well worth the trouble. Along with Clam Chowder at the Quincey Market in Boston Chilli Crab in Singapore are places we would be keen to revisit just for the food alone
3
Clark Quay is a must see when you go to Singapore and you can't miss Jumbo Seafood. Being one of the most popular restaurants, we decided to go there. The queue was expected and that's ok, shows how popular the place is! Food on the whole was good. I must however comment that the service needs improvement. The staffs were not very friendly and to get anything we had to call them more than 3 to 4 times. That was a dissapointing factor. Will I go back again..? Umm..am not so sure...as in Bangkok we get equally good food with much better servic
4
Went for Dinner with friends from College.Am allergic to Sea-Food but wife and Kids had the Chili Crab and they felt it was good.Had some chicken which was OK.But crowded place so please do book and go.
4
My favourite branch is still at Chui Hua Lin. Try their oyster omelette too. Chilli crab is probably their best. Good to buy their package which gives you loads of free vouchers etc. Good value for money!
4
We had a very tasty and delicious meal at this location.The prawns we order for entree were hugh . Our main meal was the hot chilli crab, it was expensive ,but well worth it.
4
Really great experience. Food (everything we ordered) was excellent. Had to try the chilli crab, which was really, really good. Nice atmosphere - next to the ocean and beach, away from the highway and bustle. Well worth a visit, I'll definitely be back. Prices were pretty reasonable also. Staff could have been a bit friendlier but otherwise very enjoyable
4
Over the years, 30-odd trips to Singapore I finally made it to Jumbo Seafood and I was not disappointed.Along with satay, a fried tofu dish in silk wrap, fried rice, pepper steak we had both Chili Crab and Black Pepper Crab. The Pepper Crab was the better crab dish, sweet, succulent with the pepper producing a tingle on your lips: delicious. The dish of the night thought was the stir fried pepper steak. This was tender and leaves you wanting more; we ordered a second serving of this.The only reason it did not score higher was that the bill came to over $100 a head,a bit of a shock for Singapor
4
Hundreds of patrons enjoying this restaurant. The restaurant is like watching a well oiled machine at work. Every attendant has a specific role ( colour coded shirts distinguish responsibilities ) and they all do they job efficiently! We came for the Singapore chilli crab and we weren't disappointed! The bibs given saved our clothes! The chilli sauce was magnificent ...not enough to burn your mouth out but enough to highlight the rich crab meat! Only wish there was more of the crab! They need to give you some type of bread/rolls so you can soak up that sauce!!! My son decided to have the crispy baby squid which was good but the serve was very small ( even though we ordered a medium size!)which was disappointing. Definitely recommend for the Singapore chilli crab 
3
Jumbo is steeped in history being the defacto place for singapores chilli crab. They have not only embraced this but multiplied their branches and seating capacity. Nothing wrong with that but then quality of the food suffered and service was inconsistent and generally standards have dropped. Anyone visiting will realise how 'commercial' it's become. Locals don't go to Jumbo for their chilli crab. Enough said.
4
The service is fast and courteous and the food is delicious. We had the chili crab which is a Singapore favorite and it was large enough to feed our family of three not to mention it was delicious. We also had the shrimp vary scrumptious as well. Be prepared the chili crab can be messy. I suggest sit outside to enjoy the view of the Singapore river
3
Good food consistently throughout the various outlets e.g Clark quay,east coast seafood village.All the outlets are strategically located with good view and ambience.wont go wrong if your are taking out of town tourist to check out Singapore seafood & chili crab.locals will have their own seafood haunt
3
Good meal however be ware of the hidden chargesOn the stated prices you are charged 7% GST which is fine but an additional 10% for some other badly explained charge A group of 6 had dinner totalling $ 450.00 then to be charged $ 45.00 for another charge is just not right. The cheapest bottle of wine is also $ 55.00 per bottle and in Sydney the same wine sells for $8.00 per bottleMy advice go to cheaper places with the same foo
5
Tried Jumbo as our friend recommended it by the sea. The food was super delicious and finger licking, service was fine, but the restaurant was packed with customers and groups. Worth a visit, as for aprons when eating crabs.
5
a fantastic place to eat, chaotic but enjoy the ambience it is great, the food is very very expensive, will NOT eat there again the pepper crabs is terrific though $78.00 for one crab? over the top
4
Service staff, very fast & effiecent. Very chinese fine dining. Very attentive. Their food is worth the price even thou it is expensive.
3
Good service, food was ok we ordered crab and steamed fish.
Crab was super fresh, fish a bit over cooked for my liking.
Location was nice on the water and for once not too busy.
If your in the mood for crab highly recommend.
4
Nice place and easy to visit because this restaurant is located at Clarke Quay. If you sit outdoor, you can see the canal and a nice view. Let's try chilly crab and buns. It's delicious.
2
Very expensive, Crab well over priced. Nuts put on the table at arrival whether you want them or not they are added to the bill, same for green tea. other than crab food is very average and not value for money.
5
All my favorite seafood can be found here Sale and Pepper Crab, Chili Crab, crispy squid, actually all the food here is fabulous My favorite outside dining place in Singapore
5
The early dinner with colleagues was made memorable by the delicious food. Singapore Chili Crab, sea food fried rice, fried prawns with cereals, river water vegetable, fried buns - every singe dish was awesome. We were also looked after very well. The weather was also perfec
3
We visit here every time we are in Singapore perhaps every three years. Never again...The service was great and attentive, however the food was tasteless and bland. Drunken Live prawns were already dead on arrival to the table and no taste at all, for taste you must dip them into sauce, why ? when they should be fresh and tasty. The broccoli and scallops were ok, but again no taste in the broccoli only the sauce.The chilli crab was good, lots of meat and sauce, overall very overpriced and over rated.I suggest asking a local where to find the best seafood
5
Enjoy amazing sea breeze while digging into their signature chilli crab (order chilli prawn for the same gravy and less mess) and fried buns. Wash it down with local beers or cold coconut water. Fun activity - try picking up peanuts with your chop sticks, dip in the chilli sauce & eat em with a smile.
4
The food is fresh, delicious, service is good, booked in advance, so soon have a seat, it will come again.
4
Had a Great8888 time at Jumbo. Despite we had late dinner, their service was not compromised and best place to bring overseas colleagues to showcase the courteous side and excellent service of Singapore.
4
Perfect setting, good service, good quality food and presentation. Excellent ginger and spring onion crab. Family friendly.
4
It is the only expensive meal I ate in Singapore. 4 of us spent 400+ dollars. The food was good but the place was super crowned.
4
The food was good but service was a tad disappointing. Was there for a birthday celebration and requested for our cake to be brought out lighted with candles as a surprise. However the waiter did not follow the instructions and brought the whole cake (in box) and left it on our table, expecting us to open and light it up ourselves. Other than that, service was acceptable, plates were changed in the midst of our meal and one of the servers was thoughtful enough to help us with the de-shelling of the crabs.
5
If you like seafood, you will love Jumbo. All menus that I ordered that day were all great! It was expensive but worth it. It is better to have reservation. I was so lucky that day. I came for lunch without any reservation, but they gave limited time. The Singapore Chilli Crab is must try! Fresh crab in rich, perfect sauce. Enjoy it with fried mantao. And the Salted Egg Yolk Prawns was another suprised for me.. It was really good..
3
Tourist pitch-Oh you must try the signature Singaporean Chilli crab!. (Crab cooked in sweet chili sauce). Big NO. Waste of time & money. Pepper crab. If u really like to be choked with pepper! Absolute waste of an evening. Money (yes it's expensive ). Messy & awkward (you have to gnaw at it)I would have given it poor had it not been for the service, ambience in Dempsey & ofcourse the sweet fried buns that tasted heavenl
2
Asked for the Alaskan Crab then 2 other types that were on the menu but all unavailable,.we finished with black pepper CRAB it was overpowering is was accompanied by 3 recommended dishes, sorry they were average as well.The place was overcrowded squashed in but seems like the in place, to my Australian taste & opinion operating on it's location & some sort of snob value. The only good point was the lovely sea breeze
4
We visited for dinner in early September. It was a typically warm tropical evening, but with neighbouring Indonesia burning forest, there was a heavy haze.Our local host advised against sitting outside due to unknown pollutants, so we sat in air conditioned comfort!You must book! We went at 7 midweek and there was space, but by 7:30 the place was buzzing and full - and it's huge!!Crab is top drawer- and I had pepper crab- a dry alternative to the world famous chilli crab which comes with sauce!Food was great- my wife is a fussy eater, and there were vegetable and meat options for her to choose from and enjoy! Satay was great, as was fish cake in banana leaf!!All of The cultural groups from Singapore were there! A real melting pot! Loved the atmosphere more than food quality- but combination was mesmerising!Definitely recommended
4
we waited until our last night in singapore to go out and try the famous chilli crab,we had heard from a few taxi drivers that jumbo was really good but really expensive,it was delicious a bit messy but they supply you with a bib and you do need it,we tried two different crabs and they were both lovely and we didnt find it any more expensive compared to all the other restaurants in the area,will defo go again and recommend it highl
4
We could not fault the service from the time we arrived till we left. The food was great and of a high standard I had the chilli crab for a main meal and it was the best I have ever had
4
Had a great business dinner in a private dining room and all the dishes where very tasty and sofisticated.
Service was fast and friendly.
Only really annoying thing is you have to leave the restaurant and go into the maill to use the restroom
4
Recommended by my daughter we went there. Very popular and crowded. Even with reservation, waited for another 45 minutes.
Pepper crab was very good- Very expensive .
3
Be careful, everything you eat will be charged.
Dishes are good, but expensive.
If you reserve, you can't change the table.
3
We had Black Pepper crab and Chilli Crab, we preferred the Chilli crab, at S$78 compared with S$45 at East Coast Hawkers it was a little better but not convinced it was twice as good. We had to sit outside which was far too humid, so I wouldn't repeat the experienc
4
This a a very large restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating near the ocean. There is usually a line to get in, but they are very organized and the wait is worth it. It's family orientated, does serve alcohol, and the credit cards. There are not any ATM machines, so make sure you are carrying some Singapore funds before going. Most of the cabs take credit cards, but don't assume. Cabs here are surprisingly affordable. I had the Black Peppered Crab, delicious but messy
5
I love the food here because it's very fresh especially for seafood. I'd recommend Chili Crab and Black Pepper Crab, it's very nice. Moreover, all waitresses are friendly and serve a good service. If you visit Singapore, enjoy night life around Clarke Quay shouldn't be missed. And if you go to Clarke Quay, Jumbo Seafood is a must !!
4
Don't be put off by the queue. You can phone to book a table or put your name down for. Table and they will give you the approx time. Must try chilli crab (or black pepper). SeSonal prices so ask the final price before it is prepared so no surprises! Not for the feint hearted - this is primal eating at its best
5
Went there in my last night in singaporeHad to wait for around 45 minutes until we had to share a table with other couples but it was well worth the wait. The service is good and the food arrives quickly The award winning chilli crab is to die Expect to get your hands and face dirty thoughWould eat there for the rest of my lif
5
Jumbo is the go-to place if you wish to try the famous Singapore chilli crab.. if you already tried chilli crab before.. i recommend going for salted egg crab.. its something more unusual but taste fantastic as well.. food can be a bit pricey here but you don't have to worry about cheating (unlike those in Newton Circus).. note the crab is usually big here.. if its a small group and if you ordered a chilli crab & black pepper crab.. just order one more veg, some fry rice will do.. you can always add satay and oakta... but both of them are so-so only..
5
I go to Singapore every year and we normally do Jumbo's twice on a trip. The Chilli crab is amazing. A must do!
4
As always, Jumbo lived up to the expectation. Pepper crab was delicious. A must eat restaurant for seafood lovers..
4
We visited this restaurant with colleagues and tried the chilly and pepper crabs. All food was nice and prices were normal for a seafood restaurant
4
Nice location for a final dinner before takeoff. 10 min from the airport and possible outdoor seating.
Very good food, and although it's a bit busy and crowded, there's a nice seaside athmosphere
5
The restaurant lives up to its reputation. Since we walked in without reservation, we had to wait in the queue for about 1 hour or more but it was all worth it. The food was amazing, service was prompt, chilli crab was superb and the value for money was good. The only downside was the communication problem with our server who was probably Chinese or Korean. But she had other colleagues to help us all in all we enjoyed. Great place and a must try when in Singapore
5
A few of our taxi drivers told us, we cannot leave Singapore without eating Chili Crab! When a friend of ours invited us for an evening out to eat we mentioned this to him and he brought us to the Jumbo Restaurant. We could not believe the service, it was very nice and we tried first the chili crabs. It is a bit messy to eat, but the taste is heavenly! Couldn't get enough of it. Our host ordered all kinds of different chinese seafood was excellent! The staff of the restaurant was very friendly and helpful to make sure that we enjoyed our food and of course also the nice atmosphere
4
Dinner for two, did not have to wait long and got a great table. Ordered crab with salty egg, wasabi prawns with fruit and some vegetables . The prawns were excellent and the vegetable was good however the crab was left standing for a hike and came out rather luke warm and whilst the crab was soft and tasted nice the salted egg was blande and kind of tastles
5
Visited here with a local friend in Singapore at his recommendation. After initially being unsure I must say this place was amazing. The variety was good and the chilli crabs are the best I've had in Singapore. It's a must try restaurant along with a must try chilli crabs dish. Would surely return and recommend this place to anybody in SG. https://twitter.com/amit1chaha
4
A Singapore signature seafood restaurant with yummy dishes. Should try Singapore pepper crab, chilli crab, variety of seafood dishes and fried rice. We reserved a room for dinner and a waitress took care of us, so we were away from the ambience of the crowd. And we saw a queue line of people waiting for tables. Better book a table before you dine there
4
Lucky we booked a table in advance so we didn't have to wait in the super long line. And too bad I was having a temporary allergy for no reason and couldn't have the famous curry crab. We ordered a steamed fish, an Indonesian spicy fried noodle and some vegetables. The fish wasn't up to our expectations, a bit mushy. Not sure if it was because of the fish type or maybe the fish wasn't fresh enough. The Indonesian fried noodle was the best I'd ever had! The neighbouring tables seemed to be enjoying their crazy huge juicy orange curry crabs very much. We were so jealous of them! Need to go back there in the future and try that one when I don't have allergies
5
Visitors will thank you and remember a meal of chilli or pepper crab for a long time, after the meal if you take them to jumbos. A messy but delicious meal. The seafood rice, chilli crab and pumpkin pureed prawns are hard to beat.
2
We have to move baby chair not staff, and they made me waiting so long for check. I doesnt satisfied.
3
The review title says it all - regular seafood restaurant. Food is okay, staff are okay - nothing special. Large restaurant - and by necessity, mass produced food. Sort of place to go from time to time.
5
While the chili crab was great, personally I think the pepper crab steals the show. Anyone who has ever wondered what the " breathe of the dragon" is with regards to stir fry will have it all explained in one bite!
5
One of our favorite family dining experiences in Singapore and also good for business dining. The food and drink are excellent. Service is courteous and efficient. And the chili crab quality of course is delicious.
4
Very good food and pretty good service. You need to reserve a table because it has a lot of people, but even if you go without reservation, they have a great organization and you will find to sit. Because to eat the crab generally have to catch by hand, I would like to bring more napkins
5
My son and his family live and work in Singapore and my wife and I went out to visit. He knows I like seafood and he lined up an evening at Jumbo. There's an extensive menu but I was especially recommended to try peppered crab. I was not disappointed. It was truly delicious. We tried a whole of dishes and every one was exceptional. Sat outside with family, fine food in a warm climate What more could you want
2
Waited over an hour to get a seat at this restaurant, judging on the line of people and the lure of the famous chilli crab we thought the wait would be worthwhile, how wrong we were! Finally seated on a large table in the back of the restaurant with 4 other couples who did not know each other, asked for the weight of chilli crab, told '900gms" - it was not weighed in front of us, when it arrived, the total meat we ate would have amounted to a fraction of this - only one set of utensils per couple made for a very messy meal, this plus the non-free peanuts made for night to forget. Flavor was great, but too little and too long to wait
5
Jumbo Seafood is a place not to be missed in Singapore.It has mastered the Famous Black Pepper Crab which is kind of a Singaporean National Monument if one could speak like that over food.Great atmosphere as it is simply decorated.The place is often very crowded which means reservations are recommended.The restaurant chain has a good price quality rate
4
A common conversation at Jumbo Seafood revolves around which do you prefer, the chili crab or the pepper crab ? The answer is I don't know, both are superb, so for 2 or more dining companions go ahead and spoil yourself, order both. We also selected supplementary portions of crispy baby squid, seafood fried rice & drunken prawns with a pitcher of ice cold Tiger beer to wash it down, and the legendary deep fried buns to mop up the sauces. Be warned, eating here is a messy affair; our wet wipes supply quickly became overwhelmed & even the use of baby bibs is no guarantee that your white shirt will emerge from the experience spotless ! Service at Jumbo is brutally efficient, brusque and no- frills, but no trip to Singapore for me would be complete without the grand finale here messily and noisily digging into the crabs in the packed alfresco setting with a pleasant ocean breeze providing respite from the oppressing heat and humidity drifting in off a bay sparkling with the lights of the container ships offshore
5
Highly recommend, as per the title of this post.
Furthermore,
1. they don't additionally charge the wet-tissue (with unlimited supply), but almost charge in other restaurants in SG.
2. Union Pay is accepted, but almost not in SG.
2
Friends from China are inclined to go Jumbo due to his prolific attention. However, it has become mass-production from a central kitchen. Staff are over-worked, especially during peak season.
3
We were 3 people - so we were able to order a variety of dishes. The whole fish dish was OK but not great, the sauce of the Crab dish was too heavy, the rest of the dishes were better. The ships were great.
4
It was great to be back in Singapore and enjoy the chilli and pepper crab at Jumbo Seafood on East Coast. Will continue to come back whenever I am in town
5
Highly recommended. Pepper crab or Spicy crab with a Tiger beer is the way to go. Restaurant is right on the water. Food is unique and served family style. Suggest you order different things and try all. You won't be disappointed
4
I love both the pepper and chilli crabs here. Tasty and nicely done. The rest of the food are good here. Service is satisfactory. I would recommend tourist to come here too.
4
Best Chilli crab but for me its just that nothing else special.But it is still the best Chillli crab everrr so just try it.a bit pricy thou.
5
We made an online reservation at Jumbo Riverwalk weeks before we came to Singapore as we know this is a very popular eating establishment. So glad we did. We wanted Clarke Quay restaurant but they were already booked out for the week we were there. It was only an extra 10 min walk so all was good. The food we ordered was amazing. We ordered sweet and sour prawns and scallops with xo sauce and egg fried rice. Cannot rave enough. Our food was amazing. Service was ok but the amazing food made up for it. Price a little on the expensive side but you don't mind when the food is of such an excellent quality. Highly recommend.
5
The pepper chilly crab is delicious, the black bean crab is not so special.I loved the kang koong they prepared.All the other food we tried are teriffic. But the dishes are very pricy...the same level as you have to pay in the seafood restaurant in Europe.The restaurant is always full. Without reservation...you are set on the waitng list.
5
Jumbo is an institution in Singapore but the only one to visit is East Coast sitting outside with the sea breeze. I have tried all the outlets but this is the best. I bring family, friends, visitors and business clients here. I must commend Jacky Wong, he always looks after me and my guests wonderfully, paying particular attention to our specific requirements

Great dining experience. Food is delicious and atmosphere lively and original. Very informal. Really enjoyed it. Would definitely go back for acted Singapore meal with the locals.
3
Very busy with good service, food good too.....but there's better in Singapore. Nice location and a good place to walk to along the waterfront.
5
I recommend pepper club rather than chili club
Not only Spicy but also complicated spicy taste.
Not same hot spice as Chineese Sucyuan hot chili taste.
I like pepper club too much.
Club also has many kinds. Price is different.
Sliranka club is enough.
3
I want to visit again.
If somebody never tried chilli crab I recommend here. They gave me a good memories.
5
great chilli crab and great location not cheap but worth it. Great views of the bay. If you fancy salt and pepper crab have it before the chilli one otherwise you don't appreciate the flavors
5
Of course, their chilli crabs are what puts Singapore on the culinary map. But there are other equally interesting dishes to relish. Champagne ribs are divine, as are the various steamed fish a la HK style.
5
Their chilli crab is excellent with reasonable price. Remember to make a reservation in advance. You won't be able to get a table if you just walk in.
2
We went there yesterday for the chillicrab. But after eating there, all i can think of is that "once is more than enough." We had to get hurry because the next reservation at our table was about an hour later. The waitress was not kind at all. We could get a fork after we requested it three times. The food was delicious, but considering the price, you could find tons of great restaurants than this. I would not recommend this one.
5
This place is always busy so it's best to make a booking. My husband and I definitely love our Singapore crab in Sydney. So when we tried this place, we absolutely loved it! The Singapore crab portion is great... but the sauce... simply amazing! If you ever visit Singapore, this place is a must
4
The outlet in east coast park is about the longest serving chillie crab where best seated outside n you can enjoy the sea view while dinning, there are always long Q...until more outlers are now open in the city n tourists area but going to the outlet in east coast the original store gives you n remibd you of jumbo in hongkong. .
4
We ate spicy crab and egg fried rice. They were so delicious!
The portion were reasonable. But the cost of the crab was pricy.
4
It was nice.
but I got the confirm email by twice reqeust.
except that, service and atmosphere was good.
price is quite expensive.
I could see the river view.
5
Wow this is the best I have had traditional crab it is a must pls make booking or you will miss out went down well with a cold beer enjoy the shops in the area
2
Hey, what's going on. ?!?Had been a customer since 1996, and today is the worst experience.1. Waitress, server , are poor attitude. And slow "!!2. Food menu is boring, but cooks standard had obviously deteriorate significantly.3. Had to wait at entrance when the place is half filled.4. Luckily the weather is good
4
No need for utensils, eat your crab with your hands and enjoy! My husband and I love to bring our families and friends to this restaurant for authentic Singaporean chilli crab and it never fails to impress. Try everything on the menu, be adventurous! My absolute fave thing to do is dip the warm mantou into the chilli crab sauce - tastes heavenly! The items on the menu maybe a bit pricey but it's worth every dollar. The place is always packed so it will be more convenient to reserve a table ahead of time to avoid queuing
5
My husband and I had been told almost everything we needed to know about eating chilli crab at jumbo, how much approx it would cost and that a booking was essential. we came in at less than $100 AUD for Crab and 2 servings of fried buns with which to sop up the delectable juice/gravy and a Cola each. We turned up in the afternoon and made the booking so we thought we were set. What we should have been told is how much fun it is to watch around you at others who are adept at eating this special dish and Who come prepared with plastic disposable gloves and put their phone in a plastic bag to protect it and still be able to take photos. It was great and if we had time we would have gone back again and again 
4
You can't beat the location here for grabbing some chilli crabs. It's right on the waterfront and there's lots to see whilst you're eating.Service is very efficient but lacks a personal touch I would say. Prices are reasonable compared with other chilli crab restaurants in Singapore. A couple of locals I spoke with said the chilli crab itself is better elsewhere, but for my tastes it was perfect. They have a much better range of seafood available than other places around. All in all it's a good spot for dinne
3
I am a vegetarian and imagine me going to Jumbo east Coast every time I visit Singapore. I have devised and survived so any veg can. There are lots of options that can satisfy and fill you up..I love peanuts and camomile tea. I hate Tofu however the vegetables are awesom
3
Jumbo is a safe option if you want to take someone to an atmospheric seafood place without breaking the bank. The food is reliable and pretty good, prices are not cheap, but not expensive either. The service is more like a hawker centre than a restaurant, but that is part of the charm of the atmosphere...this isn't fine dining! I'm sure the crabs get smaller every time, but the spicy sauce that the chili crab is cooked in in undeniably delicious. These days I let the guests eat the crab and concentrate on the easy-to-eat sauce. Salted egg prawns are one of our family favourites and the fried rice is generally very tasty. You have to be prepared to keep asking and calling the waitresses or you might find yourself waiting around, but once you get used to that, it is a good family/friends meal. Several branches are all quite similar in quality/service, but we like the East Coast one best because it is by the sea
5
I and my friend was roaming around in clarke quay and then we came across Jumbo seafood. We had to wait there for like 10 minutes to get in. We ordered the famous dish chilli crab. The price of dish depends on the size of crab. We got a big one. Since we both eat a lot we were ok with it. And yes before they start cooking they will let you know the weight and price. We had a some kind of Singaporean herbal tea and it wasn't really tasty. But the Chilly crab was mouth watering. Would definitely try again from this restaurant on my next visi
4
We had the pepper crab and chilli crab which were very tasty. We would recommend the chilli crab however. Also try the water melon juice. It was very refreshing after the hot and spicy crabs.
4
The ideal location for sea food lovers. They have excellent varieties like Lobsters, Crabs, tiger prawns. Add to that is free WiFi connection. I loved the egg fried rice they served. My friends were harping over the crab varieties.
4
Seafood..Better of head to East Coast Parkway to have the selection.
Clark Quay area will cost more, seeing a tourist coming.
2
long wait to get the table; really expensive; the food was just average, not worth the price; will not come back; do not recommend
5
Revisited Jumbo for a quick dinner with friends. Food was brilliant as always, fresh and tasty. Singapore chilli crab is an essential, but pepper crab is often overlooked. Good thing we booked ahead, the restaurant was full. We visited on a Thursday night. We were a group of 10 with a number of kids. All accommodated with no problems and high chairs where needed.
2
It's so short time to eat something. You just give us 2hours for eating. And, I didn't say to employee anything about tip. But he told me that the change is his tip. Actually I'm so embarrassed. Anyway, it's so too many problem of your store
4
been to many restaurants for chilli crab but so far found the ones at jumbo are the best.have dined at their 2 other outlets in clarke quay too.sauce is flavourful and can taste the crab juices in it. not too sharp chilli paste taste and the crabs are fresh.but lately their rates have gone up.abt 55 to 68$/kg in the past 15 months.not something one can afford often but maybe once in 6-12months now.at least at the end of the meal u will be satisfied that it was tasty.Avg spend a couple- 100-150$
5
This is my first time having dinner here at Jumbo. I know they have few branches, but I ended up coming here.It is best you make a reservation before you go there because of the long q and trust me you would not want to wait.the food wise is tasty! the crabs..... OMG! Super fleshy, delicious! their famous is the chilli crabs and pepper crabs which is a must try! make sure to get their "fried man tao!"Price wise, it is pricy, well its a popular restaurant thats why. But after all, if you are willing to spend more, and taste singapore chilli crabs, this is the place to come
2
First time I've ever had to share a table with strangers at a restaurant! I found this very odd. It would have been nice if the waitresses took the trouble to assist with introductions - it would have actually been quite enjoyable to chat with locals or other travellers. Instead there's an awkward avoid-looking-at-each-other sensation of intruding on somebody else's meal. There was also a clear feeling that the staff wanted you to hurry up and move on, with the queue of people waiting to be let into the restaurant lined up just a few metres away from the diners. There was no hospitality shown by the staff - just orders taken and food later dumped in front of us. The chilli crab was marked POA but no price was advised to us on ordering.On sitting down, we were immediately served some type of tea (without being informed what it was) and later noticed there was a charge for the drink. We didn't like it and didn't drink it. After ordering chilli crab we had to request the bibs which we noticed local diners had been given. The chilli crab was nothing special. The crab flavour was lost. We had recently caught some fresh crab at home and cooked them in garlic and butter which had been infinitely nicer
4
We ated the sauces at home in Canada, brought by my brother. Now we have the occasion to eat at this famous place, a little bit disappointed, so noisy, and crownded. Food was good but not THAT GOOD.I bought a lot of the jumbo sauce for home thought
4
an experience. went as a pre wedding get together. picked the food by going round the displays then all cooked fresh. the seafood fantastic. prawns were huge. would recommend and return
5
Best Seafood in Singapore.Very nice food.better to book earlier.Because always you will find a long queue in front of this hotel.Try crab specialties.
5
The crab was so good! Make sure u get those steamed buns with it to soak up the yummy sauce. We ordered a bowl of rice also to eat it with the sauce. Well worth the money.
5
I go there every time I visit Singapore. If you love sea food, this place is not to be missed.I prefer to order 2 small/medium crabs one with black pepper and the other with chilli sauce.That way I get the best of both worlds.The staff are friendly and helpful.This place is open air and overlooks the sea.The quality of the seafood is really good
4
Not cheap but fresh and very good. The bbq fish is just awesome, they warn you of a 45 minutes wait (that actually vary from 10 to 55 minutes) but it is worth it and if you take your time in drinks and first course you do not wait much
4
Have always love dining here. Good food! Only gripe I have this time is the 2 hour limit to one's dining experience. I was at the Upper Circular Road location on a weekday.The staff were rushing me to place order as I was waiting for 2 more friends to arrive. When the time is up, staff were rushing us to pay up and leave. I will not be back at this location. I went to the Dempsey location and there were no 2 hour dining limit
5
We had 11 people attend a dinner here and we were not disappointed. Others in the group were regulars, this was my first time. Although I am not a fan of crab, this place serves it as their specialty. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the red tilapia in konya sauce! We sat outside - overlooking the fantastic sea view. All food was excellent, quickly delivered and we always had attentive staff though the place was so busy
4
We had 3 people, 2 adult and 1 child, and ordered 2 dishes(1pc spicy crab and 1pc fried rice noodle with shrimp ) and 2 dessert. The food was really very delicious and in huge portions. All of us were very full, it would be better for 3 adults to share it. The waiter with good service and especially offered a baby chair for my daughter. We seated along the riverside, with a good position to enjoy night veiw. Everthing was very good except a little expenive dishes^_^ Haha.......
5
great place for dinner especially early evening where you see people jogging outside the restaurant, walk their dog; totally different experience as compare a meal in the heart of the city center. Standard of food is good so don't worry just enjoy. Price wise, mid range I guess, some fish comes with different sizes and price range too. A lot tourist will have their dinner here before heading to CHANGI airport or via versa
4
A colleague took us to this restaurant specifically to eat chilly crab. The place was busy and we were pleased we had a reservation. The starters were fine but not spectacular. However the chilli crab was worth the visit. Bibs were provided and napkins and implements required to get to the meat and clean up afterwards. Singapore is famous for chilli crab and this was very tasty.
4
Brought my parents to try the local famous chilli crab. They loved it. Other seafood varieties are also great tasting with its local version. Lovely time by the seaside enjoying the cool evening breeze.
3
I ate famous chilli crab there, it was good, but it had small crab and lots of chilli sauce. Too much chilli sauce. I went there on Sun, that was so crouded. I recommend you must make a reservation!!
4
must try the chili crab, yam ring scallop and bamboo shoot. everything is fresh. downside is have to wait for at least an hour. try going there later around 9pm to avoid long queue. price is not cheap but the food is worth the wait.
5
Four of us just had to have the famous Chili Crab while in Singapore. We went to Jumbo Seafood, which was highly rated on several sites. We ordered an appetizer and then three chili crabs for the four of us (plenty). When they brought out the "lobster bibs" we knew we were in for an experience. In fact, it was so messy that some patrons actually brought surgical gloves to protect their hands from the delicious delicacy (don't worry, there is a sink with soap located conveniently within the restaurant). We dug into the pot of sauce and crab, pulling apart the crab carapace to get to the yummy meat. It was absolutely delicious and made for a lot of laughs as worked our way through the dish. Paired with local beer, it was a wonderful meal. They also offered orders of buns to sop up the sauce. I would suggest at least three orders, as the bun size and order quantity are small. Be sure to go early, as the restaurant fills quickly. Reservations are a good idea. Don't miss this interesting, delicious local dining experience. It's something to talk about when you get home
4
Made the booking a week in advance for a friday night date. They were almost fully booked. Managed to reserve a table for two and arrived there on time. Quick response by the meeter greeter, table ready within less than 5mins. waiter doesnt speak fully english so had a bit of lost in translation. Ordered food and drinks rightaway, meals came in 15mins. We ordered 1 jumbo chilli crab, 2 portion of buns, 1 stir fry veggie and 2 chinese tea.total cost sg$114. However all foods are delicisious and fresh. But not that spectacular - if you are hard to pleased. I wouldnt come too often because i think there are plenty other places in singapore that sells chilli crab too. But for special occasion would def come agai
4
My son had booked a table at this restaurant for 6 people. My husband and I turned up first, only to find that despite booking a table we still had to wait approx. 30 minutes for our table.I wont say the food was 100% worth the wait but it was pretty good.We ordered lots of different dishes which all turned up at different times - my favourte had nothing to do with seafood as it was the spare ribs - delicious.We would eat here again
5
We had heard about the famous Chilli crab dish at Jumbos and so had to try it. We were not disappointed and enjoyed it sitting outside next to the Clarke Quay River and were treated to an amazing aerobatic flight display put on with jets and various aeroplanes practising for the upcoming SG50 celebrations. We enjoyed our meal so much that we booked again for the following Friday asking for the same seats. We turned up on time and were escorted to the exact table we nominated and this time tried a whole fish which was equally delicious. I have rated the value as average but this is because Fish is extremely expensive at $100 per kilo whereas we are used to much cheaper prices in Sydney. I guess when overseas you have to take it as it comes
4
First the location . Clark Quay is a picturesque spot on the Singapore riverfront , frequented by large number of locals and tourists daily . Jumbo Seafood Resturant sits on one side of a neat pathway with the river flowing on the other side. The water body and the resultant pleasant breeze contrast the lavishness of surrounding skyscrapers. The restaurant itself is on the ground floor of a designer high rise and gets a readymade party ambience . The guests get to sit at thee levels : few tables outdoor , the larger hall and finally an air conditioned enclosure. Tables need to be booked in advance especially during weekends but the restaurant also tries to accommodate the walk-in guests. But the clinching factor has to be the food and so it is. The joint is best known for its crab preparations. The reputation is well - deserved. Pepper crab is its most celebrated dish but we decided to order chilli crab as we wanted a preparation with some gravy. We weren't disappointed . Prawn and egg-fried rice were equally palate friendly. Fried buns were delicious . The chilli sauce made a tasty , spicy concoction in which the buns and fried prawn could be dunked. Complimentary Chinese tea with jasmine flavour was being poured into small cups as and when they got emptied. Though pricey , Jumbo experience was good. But whether this impression can be sustained after repeated visits is a bit doubtful because appeal of sea food is not unlimited to some palates
5
Great all Singapore seafood includes world's best chili crab, drunken prawns, kang kong (vegetables), BBq chicken (with sea salt), steamed garoupa fish (Hong Kong style), even best satay.Enjoy with jug of Tiger Beer and free wifi.The standard of 25 years is put hogher every year.Reservation in advance is must (as all seats will be taken as of 18:00 hours every day!!Big groups and incentive dinners is possible.Best is outside sitting at beach (sea view so all vessels in Port of Singapore are there to look at).Aircon room is wate of atmosphere (so fo not sit there!
3
Large restaurant with a big outdoor area situated by the sea. It's loud and busy as expected, which I don't mind. But the food was only just alright and the service is average. Definitely overpriced for what you're getting. Wouldn't come back, so much good food to be had elsewhere!Also, I liked the black pepper crab better than then chill crab
2
Food is standard and might be slightly better than those neighbourhood seafood restaurants,definitely not worth for money
5
A complete Yummy restaurant, the chili crab is just out of the world, even the shrimps/ prawns are too good
3
Had dinner there with good a colleague. Wonderful seafood restaurant. The staff was very friendly even the restaurant was very hectic. Give here only 3 stars as average as the restaurant is an noisy place and very busy.
4
The food was worth the value. Service crew were attentive and friendly. There were a lot of variety to choose from. Waiting time is a problem as there's a lot of people. It's better to reserve in advance before heading there.
5
We've been going to Jumbo for nearly 20 years. LOVE the place! Every time we order a black pepper crab and a chilli crab, because we can't decide which we like the most. So why decide? Also a must-eat is the deep-fried steamed buns to dunk into the fabulous chilli sauce. The garlic baby kai lan. Chicken and beef satays with peanut sauce are a great starter. Maybe order some fried rice at the end if you aren't already stuffed full as it's also good. Every time we pass thru Singapore we go to Jumbo at East Coast. Luckily we are living here again so go often now :) We love to sit outside and see the lights come on in Indonesia as dusk falls and all the boat lights just off the coast. There's a guy who has a crazily lit up motorbike, covered in fluorescent coloured night lights and he drives slowly along East Coast Parkway after nightfall. Gotta just love the whole deal! Crab is THE food to eat in Singapore
4
Most tourists to Singapore would like to try the Chili Crabs dish and Jumbo Seafood at East Coast is one of the most popular places for this! They also serve the pepper crab dish too, so you can try both favors at the same restaurant! Other popular dishes are drunken prawns, claypot soon hock fish, fried asparagus, seafood fried rice or mee goreng (local Malay spicy noodles), salted egg yolk prawns,etc. Remember to order fried small breads (mantou) to dip the sauce of the chili crabs. The chicken satay and otah dishes at East Coast outlet are also good to let your visitors have a taste of local dishes. Do call them for reservations as dinner time can be very packed
5
These are their signature dishes. Have either one or both if you can and rice, you're set. Place is busy and spills out of the restaurant. Nice location, by the water. Didn't make reservations ? no problem, line moves fast we waited <30 min. But we didnt mind the wait we came here, to have their famous Chili crabs. Fast service and friendly staff. Just wish they have this in SoCal
1
One has heard great things about Jumbo that would have made them famous.We first went to The one in Clarke Quay and were told 1.5 hours to wait for a table so did not bother.Next day, went here to the ECP one and found a table right away.The lady taking the order, hardly spoke any english so communicating was impossible.What we ordered on the menu, was different from what we got.My son asked for spare ribs and was told it will come with broccoli as per the picture. He got a minuscule portion, no veggies. The lady had to be called, and she says, "oh the picture just shows the veggies but actually it comes without it"!!!! She supposedly apologised and said will give us a free desert, which was some sweet liquid nonsense.Other son asked for a fish, and got some horrible rings with it.My wife asked for a fried rice, and got this lame, tasteless, shrimp fried rice, and then I ordered the 'famous' chilly crab.Sure the size was reasonable, but the sauce was like it was dumped in the plate, and very average tasting. at $57 for the crab alone, its was a ridiculous price. I can get a larger sized crab in India for half the price, and tastier.The whole meal costed $180 or more, which in my opinion, with the taste, service, and food should have been maximum $50.Very very disappointed, and definitely never going back there again, nor recommending this place to anyone
5
Jumbo Seafood at the East Coast Seafood Centre has the best Chilli Crab/Pepper Crab I have ever had in Singapore. If there is a nice breeze it is great to sit outside and enjoy the food. I have eaten here many times and it is absolutely the best
2
There are lots of places you can buy Chili Crab in Singapore for half the price that tastes just the same or better. This is a tourist trap and you will typically order more food as Chili Crab isn't enough. When you get your bill, ouch! And it is not just the food however simple things like Coke that will set you back a packet! The service is average as they churn out tourists so you are just another headcount to them.
2
The waitress kept pushing us to order more food. At the end our bill was $570. We couldn't finish at all
4
Awesome crabs. Chilli crab better than pepper crab. Crowded and long waiting times. Worth the wait. Have a good system of making a reservation.
5
Crabs is yummy. The sauce is good with steam buns or deep fried buns. The shrimp is also good with herbal soup. The restaurant sea view with little wind make you feel good and relax.
5
Next to the sea. Very windy and cooling in the evening. Great place to bring friends from overseas. Order the chilly and black pepper crab. Mocca ribs also a must-try.
4
It's kind of a tradition to have chilli crab in Singapore and Jumbo is a good place to try it.. Jumbo on East Coast is situated on the water so offers nice views for a lunch time meal...
3
Brought my family with guests to celebrate their wedding anniversary but was disappointed wt the rude staff & wrong dishes served without any apologies given. Normally, i gave a 5 ratings for the last 20 years patronising this restaurant but not this time round. Thank you founder, management, chefs, kitchen hands & all those waiters who served well. Would i recommend to anyone, no i wont because the rotten attitude spoilt our evening & worst of all spoilt a meaningful happy occasion of a wedding anniversary. Who wouldnt
5
Jumbo seafood is very famous for its signiture chili crab, the medical wine shimp, pineapple duck also very yammi, all my friends are loved that, we visited the branch at east coast golf club, there the scene is more beautiful and less crowed. As luch time they also serve Tiam Sum, which is also good to try
5
This is a "must do" in Singapore. The chilli and pepper crabs are not cheap, but after chicken-rice, this has to be the next most iconic Singaporean dish. Make sure you take wet-wipes with you, eating this stuff is really messy, so probably not good on a first date
5
Excellent service and of course their signature chilli crab is mouth wateringly good..I am craving it right now. We had the Mee Goreng and deep fried buns to soak up the juices and all were so good! 1 crab was enough for 2 but all the locals have 1 each. Looking forward to returning and sampling some other dishes too. Full of locals with just a few tourists but this may be due to the fact you MUST book. It is packed and has a queue waiting on any night so do book. Reasonably priced, fresh and delicious
4
I was taken to Jumbo Seafood Restaurant by some Singapore friends. There were enough of us so we were able to sample a number of dishes, all of which were wonderful. The restaurant is huge, with a first floor open to the sea and air, and an upper floor with large tables for large groups in a large, charmless air conditioned room. We had a magical fried rice with tiny shrimp; crunchy deep fried baby squid; chilli crab; pepper crab; a poached whole shrimp dish allegedly made by flaming live shrimp in a pot, then serving the shrimp in their shells; a nice steamed sea bass. Chicken and spare ribs were OK - better than New York takeout but not better than real Chinese restaurants in New York or, for that matter, the better hawker stands (Maxwell Road, for example) in Singapore. I liked NoSignboard's chilli crab better, by a hair, but have no other comparisons. I liked the chilli crab better than the pepper crab - the latter was hotter, and had a lot of black pepper on it. If you love the taste of black pepper go for it, else get the chilli crab if you are having only one. Service is quick and competent but charmless -- no one to fill your glass if you are halfway down. We arrived at 9:00 PM and the place was still mobbed. They have an elevator to get to the second floor - one of our party was in a wheelchair
4
reserved table using their online service, easy and convenient. Good food and food service. Will recommend to my friends.
3
Very pricey, made to share a table with other unknown persons, not a place we would ever return to. Forget it, cross it off the list.
3
We were recommended to Jumbo by several friends, we expected an upmarket environment instead it felt like a family " sausage factory" diner. Service was ordinary, food acceptable, prices high, ambiance non existent. Would not recommend to anyone expecting a sophisticated dining experience.
3
The restaurant is always packed. Got a table without reservation. Ordered the set dinner menu with for chilli crab for 4 people. The food is average but it is not cheap.
3
We booked a week ahead to get a table for 2 at 6pm on a Monday. We arrived 10 mins early, and waited till 6pm, as the restaurant was pack. Taken to our table and with a tag 7:30pm - time allotted for 1.5 Hrs. Waited for 10 mins for the order. We ordered1.3 KGS Crab $101, Crispy honey Squid Med $18, 2 x glasses Tiger beer at $7.50 x 2, 2 x Boild Rice, no peanuts, no Chinese tea. Total is $160.07 ncludng 10%, service, and 7% GST. The Chilli Crab was average with plenty of sauce. Quite well balance taste.May not return as it's not worth the hassel of booking and the expensve price
1
The restaurant does not take reservations. So you arrive and take a number to wait to be seated. I was awaiting a good chilli crab, having eaten there in the past year.The chilli crab was no were near the previous visits taste nor quality. The staff were over rushed and had blank stares like zombies. I was half way through my dinner when the bill was plonked down on my table. Instant bad vibe.A party of Mainland Chinese just pushed through the flowers to occupy an table still being cleared and sat down.The staff should have ordered them to leave and take a number, as a large group of people had been waiting in line for that table. Instead the staff served them.Then to get a finger bowl with less than 1/2 a cm of water in it for washing fingers after the meal. This time it was an expensive hurry-up and finish your meal.Having seen the rudeness of the tourists from the PDRC in some parts of Singapore and at this restaurant, I shall not be returning to Jumbo any time soon
4
There are multiple outlets of Jumbo restaurant in Singapore, while we went to the one in Clarke Quay.We ordered the Butter garlic crab which is served with Breads on the sides. They also give an apron to wear as it's quite a messy affair. However, the mess is because you just cannot stop licking the awesome curry.They also serve the famous "Gorden Ramsey" prepared Chilly crab as well
5
got a table in nice location with no wait, despite not having made a booking. Fine selection of seafood but the star is the chilli crab, with a pepper version if you dislike chilli. Attentive waitress who kept the glass of green tea filled up. Nice reasonably priced New World wines.Juicy prawns which also tickled the palate
3
Perceived as the best in singapore. Really ? I recalled Gordon Ramsey taking the challenge to compete with jumbo on chilli crabs. The verdict ? Ramsey did better than jumbo.I must admit years ago. It was really good but unfortunately, the standard of best chilli crabs aren't there anymore. It's still acceptable but nothing to rave about these days.Price is relatively expensive .... Try the deep fried squids in sweet sauce, drunken prawns are an added plus
4
I like the crab and the shrimp with cereals. They are delicious. We also ordered the special fruit juice with soda water and they tasted good too. We chose the 4-people set dinner for 5 people. The portion is large and we almost could not finish it.
5
It is a much to have the chilli crab when you Ho to jumbo especially at the Dempsey restaurant the atmosphere out on the deck at night is a great experience
5
We visited the East Coast location with friends and it was our first time. The food was amazing. We tried the black pepper crab as well as the chill crab, and both were delicious. Definitely use the bibs they provide, because it gets messy, but that's the best part!! And don't wear white! Dunking the bread in the remaining sauce was the icing on the cake. A bit expensive, but having just moved here, we have come to realize that dining out is always expensive
5
Really enjoyed the the usual assortment of Chinese seafood. We loved the sauce used for Chili Crab, but all the meals were delicious. They had an interesting way of preparing the prawns by cutting them in half with the shell on. We had a larger party that required a surcharge, but like many places in Asia, the Wet wipes on the table are a pay if you use type thing
5
Having read a fair amount about Jumbo I was pleased to finally get a chance to go. And the Chilli Crab is all of that! There is no clean way to eat this, just get stuck in and deal with the mess after. Setting by the river is beautiful and the restaurant is constantly buzzing
4
Food as usual was very good. The chili crab, the fried tilapia fish and the salted egg prawn. Yum Not the first time there but this time round, the service was a little slag. The price was somewhat pricy then usual. Our family was placed to sit near the ordering and food serving counter and my chair was knocked a couple of times by the delivery staff. Better to get the table inside

We had a great night here on a work outing, starters of mixed sate and after that the food just kept coming! both the Chilli and the Black Pepper Crab a great BBQ Seafood platter, make sure to order the staemed buns to dip in the Chilli crab sauce!Agree with others about booking ahead, I think half of the seating area is undergoing a refurb so it's mobbed, and if you book early enough you can get a table with a view, we did but unfortunatly there was a thunderstorm mid meal, staff coped admirably and quickly moved us inside to a table at the back without any hassle. Well done to all
4
It is a very nice seafood restaurant. Open for dinner only. Very crowded most weekdays and best to call for reservation on weekends. best have table outsude where you can feel the nice night air and sea breeze. All seafood is great. Price is on the mid range
5
Had a fantastic meal of Chilli Mud Crab and also Black Pepper Crab. It was truly delicious. My advice is to book a table as it gets heavily booked, and we went on a Tuesday night. It was packed full of people. Try and get a table outside as well. We also had fried rice and other meals but my favourite was the Black Pepper Crab. WARNING it is very hot, but we loved it
4
we went to restaurant on a Saturday night.We got there early but there was still a queue.We would suggest you book if you dont want to wait.We found the food and service very good.Its located in East Coast Park a taxi ride from centre of Singapore.The restaurant facing the sea so it is cool.We understand there is another Jumbo Seafood in Singapore.We found this restaurant clean with efficient staff.We only tried the black pepper crab and a started both of which were goo

We went to Jumbo to eat crabs because it is said to the best one in Singapore. Food was very good but services was really bad which is something not usual in Singapore:- We had to wait 20 minutes for our beers to come- When food came, we had no fork / spoon and we had to ask 3 times to be able to start eating.- We ordered rice which never came but was on the bill (they corrected it after we told them)- Our full plates were not changed with new ones.Those are the reasons why I will not come back to Jumbo.
4
Great pepper- and chillicrab. Singapore classic, great views on the boats anchored in the Singapore Strait. Nice outside terrace to escape the air conditioning for a bit.
3
Chilli Crab was very good but other dishes were average.
Service ok but not fantastic. All up not worth the trip there and would try the one on the river if I was to go again - as u would have the view.
4
love the ambiance, food and location....just by the sea-side, great views....!!
creamy crab for kids is also loved by adults...who prefer non-spicy food. Satay is ok ok.
seafood lovers paradise

AMAZING SEAFOOD
If you love seafood this is the place to go!! I tried a range of different dishes and they were all spectacular!
4
The price is something but so far it's the best Chili Crab in town!!No need to order rice, just fried mantou, the chili crab and some veggies.Life is good.I like the fact that they serve until early morning on Weekend. But if you go there in a large group, it's better for you to reserved first. just go to their website for reservation (24-hr prior to booking date
3
Came here for dinner with my relatives we ordered the set menu for 6-8. Good food but very expensive and very crowded. Thanks to the river view we enjoy the place. Service staff mostly speak chinese for a foriegner like us its very hard to understand and you can only eat for an hour. Hope that they have more rooms for other customer so wr dont need to rush and enjoy the food
3
They served really nice varieties of seafood with a touch of local favors (ie. Satay) and locations like east coast park & Vivo city are getting so crowded even on weekday nights as it typically is a ideal place to bring overseas business associates for dinner when they want local style seafood.. But the price is on the upwards trend too.. I'm used to be their regularly supporters especially for their famous Chilli & black pepper crabs but the rate per kg is killing me... If I didn't wrongly the last visit the rate per kg for the crabs was $65/kg so for a couple to enjoy a nice size crab is easily that price excluding any other dishes if u like more varieties to the dinner... Toooo expensive but the food is not too bad to impress overseas frens or the bill is being subsidies by company :)
5
It was soooo difficult to reserve a table for 4 here, I was lucky to get a table on my husbands birthday and we ordered the most talked about the signature dish of Singapore "Chilli Crab". We loved it and the rest of our Prawn dish and asian fried rice and BBQ chicken. One word "AMAZING FOOD"
3
I usually will have crab as part of my meal with my spouse. Jumbo Seafood is one of the better restaurants that serves great chilli and black pepper crab. The most recent one I went is in March 2015, the one located at Riverside Walk. We ordered a large size chilli crab with ample sauce and its nice deep fried buns, some drinks and a dish of vegetables. We enjoyed the food very much, the only disappointment is its staff. The service of staff is aggressive yet slow. From our observations, the level of service will depend on the profile of the customers. They tend to be more helpful and provide quicker service to the foreigners than locals. We were served last although we had ordered earlier than several tables who arrived later than us
4
The price range of crab can be quite wide. Some of them are SGD 69 per kg, another is SGD 109 per kg. 1kg crab can be served for 2 people. I think the pepper crab is quite good, is fresh and valued for its delicate flavour
3
Chilli crab was delicious, but there are probably better options - where you don't have to put up with the aggressive service.
4
I've been to Jumbo many times. How can we come to Singapore without eating Chilli Crab. Jumbo does serve the beset Chilli Crab in town. But they are not cheap at all. A chilli crab costs more than S$100. But we really cannot resist it.
3
Good for Chilli and pepper crab, but from my point of view almost all the food offered in the menu is deep fired. Make sure you want to eat that kind of food before getting there.
5
I'd love the foods & everything out there. Especially Singapore .Chilli Crab & Stir Fried Salted Egg with Shrimp. I love this restaurant And service. I'd recommend to all my friends ...
4
Jumbo seafood has the best chilli crab, you don't need to explore other types of crab dishes. Just attack their signature dish with fried mantou.
However, they are always crowded, must make advance booking for all their central outlets.
5
visited Jumbo's in June 2015 once again didn't disappoint. Was probably the best meal I had whilst in Singapore. Favourite is the pepper crab and fried rice.
5
Don't forget to try the Singapore chilli crab, jumbo prawns, squid.
Nice seating too in the open and by the sea. Perfect atmosphere to binge on fresh and delectable seafood!!
4
Crabs are gorgeous. We ended up sucking finger and wiping the plate with buns. Clams are tender and flavorsome. Full of people around dinner time and not the most attentive service. Most of the prices are seasonal. Cost us around SGD 70 per head and certainly depends on your choice of food
4
There are multiple Jumbo seafood restaurants in Singapore. My favourite is on the East Coast a Parkway. Great ambience, plastic tables and chairs and loud boisterous crowd. Easily the best chilli mud crab and deep fried rolls in Singapore. Pull on your plastic bib and dig in. Crowds begin to line up at the door at 7:00 so bookings are essential. Don't let the cheap and cheerful look of the place fool you, it is expensive with their signature Chilli mud crab and drinks for 2 setting you back about $100

That day it was about to turn into the noon time, my friend and I needed to fill up our stomach before getting on the boat tour. We walked along the river passing several seafood restaurants till we saw Jumbo (at the Riverwalk close to Clarke Quay). What was so funny was we didn't know before that it's such a famous restaurant for Chili Crab! We went through its menu for couple pages and saw the key word "Award-Winning Chili Crab", so we decided to have lunch there. And since we were so hungry, we couldn't be picky anymore lol. And it turned out to be the best meal in our Singapore trip! Let's say, we ordered 3 dishes which are:- Chili crabs: Sweet & a bit spicy, very tasty. The crabs were huge. We couldn't finish them all.- Fried Cereal Prawns: Yum! If you like prawns and something sweet (with a hint of salty taste), this you can't miss!- Scallops & Broccoli: Hmm they were great but not extraordinary.We paid around SG$150 which was alright. Happy meal and want to come back!One more thing, we were there quite early so the restaurant wasn't full yet. The staff said that it's better to make RSVN to avoid disappointment because usually there's a really long line after 1PM
4
Set near the water, Jumbo Seafood Restaurant is one of the best places for Singapore Chilli Crab. The Black Pepper Crab is also good. Reasonable prices for great food.
4
When in Singapore - make it a point to stop by Jumbo Seafood and savor their famous Chili Crab and deed fried buns
3
Relaxed dining by the riverside if you fancy sea food. Chilled beer and some amazing local tasty cuisines. Service is a little rushed and you may face challenges communicating in English.
5
Food and services are all very good! Chili crab is my favorite dish. Should try the Lime & Aloe Vera juice!
4
Had to overnight at Changi Airport. The East Coast Seafood Centre is a10 minute taxi ride from the airport. Two of us shared some fantastic garlic prawns, one chilli crab and the mandatory buns. And a few beers of course. Fantastic meal for around $100S in total
5
I hear about Singapore Chili crab in the state for awhile and finally I and my family had a chance to try it out tonight while on vacation. I did know what to expect with the exception that the dish suppose to taste sweet, savory, spicy and hot. Well, I am glad this place did not disappoint. We ordered the following on our meal for a price of 257SGD.(total include service tips, taxes)2 chili crabs1 fry baby squid(small)Black pepper beef(small)Spinach(medium)Salted fish and chicken fried rice(medium size enough for 4)6 fried buns(must order separately for a small price, dip it in the sauce)The service was good. The server constantly replaced our plates. BTW, the place also provide bips, plastic gloves, crab clamp to break the shell, moist towel for a small cost.The only thing I did not like is that they charged for tea, moist towel, peanut appetizer. So if you don't want them, tell them when they start serving you. This is not the only place that charge for these things. We went to Boon Tung Kee for their famous chicken the night before and were charged for them as well.Also, you can sit inside if you want AC or sit outside close to the Singpore river.In summary the meal was good. We liked all the entrees with the exception of the fried squid
4
We had a superb meal, having reserved a table as they are always busy. The service was not 'fine-dining' - but we know this is a chain and thought that the waiters were all very helpful. A smile and a kind word work wonders if things are a bit slow. We loved it as the quality of the ingredients, fish, rice, everything , was really good, and preparation and freshness were obvious. Go, enjoy
4
I like the foods, I ate the Chilly Crap and several other things. but the clerks are not that kind enough, and serving is a little slow. I think the servers are so new, so they don't know what they should do when people come. Too cloud and slow service made me not to have good feeling for my dinner.
4
Food itself was great as this restaurant is well known. Before i went, i had made a reservation requesting outside seat, but it was too humid and hot there when i got there, i asked to change our seat inside, but they rejected. So be careful when you make a reservation.Second, after paying for the good food, i checked my receipt and noticed the price for the peanuts and tea was included! Fortunately, i got my money back, but there was no apology. So please check your receipt after the payment. Jumbo has one of the best foods ever, but is not one of the best restaurant ever.
4
This Jumbo group restaurant has by far the best seafood I have had in Singapore . There is nothing but delight at the ambience outside n the open and having the pepper or chilli crabs and their grilled prawns. Just sublime....until the bill arrives. One crab at S$ 60 ++ is enough to cause severe in-digestion and the bill for a group of 4 can easily add up to over S$ 700 if one is not careful with what is ordered. If money is not a concern - just go ahead and gorge yourself on the delightful fresh food on the menu
5
I love spicy crab, it's very big one fit for 6 adults and 2 children and very delicious. This restaurant beside river is good view. The staff friendly and hospitable. I love this choice.
5
The chili crab was fantastic but also one of the messiest meals of my life! Definitely a must-have when you visit Singapore.
4
Nice sauce!! We bought four seasoning sauce mixes after dinner. We will prepare vinyl gloves next time.
3
the crab seems not fresh. The meat was soft and watery.
Overall, the atmosphere and service staffs were good.
3
Tonight was my 1st time to Jumbo. Team dinner in preparation for a long week. My only challenge with this restaurant is the heat. Eating spicy crabs in this climate out doors almost made me pass out, but I didn't want to miss the next course. Some of my FAV's was spicy crab, pepper crab, roasted chicken, and the refreshing melon dessert
4
Perfect location by the river, amazing food, crabs - especially the black pepper sauce crabs are just stunning. Fresh as fresh can be, perfect amount of spice, labour intensive to eat, but you are well looked after (including their famous bibs) and the service is just top class
4
It was my first time to taste the seafood in Singapore. I made reservation a month ago at Riverside store. We arrived the restaurant at 7:30pm. The receptionist was polite and able to arrange the seat quickly for air-conditioner area. Then we ordered black pepper crab, cereal prawn and scallop. Those dishes were enough for us with Tiger beer! In general, all foods were fresh and good taste especially the crab, it was special flavor. I would recommend Jumbo restaurant!!
5
When you plan a stop-over in Singapore only so you can come here to have black pepper crab .. what does that say!!I've been coming here over the years whenever I can get to Singapore and it never disappoints. It just seems to get bigger every time I come, this time there were queues waiting to get in. People were waiting 30mins at least for a table. Luckily I made a reservation :-)If I could say anything negative about it, it would be that it may be too popular. Once upon a time you would be served exactly when needed or even before. I would never have an empty beer. As it is now so busy you sometimes struggle to get a waiters attention. I guess that is the price you pay for success. I almost want to rate it very bad just so it's not so busy!!! but I could never do that.If you are in Singapore, what am I saying .... if you're in SEA ... stop-over in Singapore and go to Jumbo at the East Coast Parkway. It is one of the best meals I have ever eaten.And it's cheap too .... 3 people ... view of bay, crab, rice & other food + lots of beer for under $200 SGD is pretty good value in Singapore these days
5
Whenever I visit Singapore this dinner is a must for me and once again it didn't disappoint. I always check out the reviews before a visit and there are some mixed ones so I always wonder if it will be as good as before, but it always is! I have been coming to this restaurant since the early 1990's and still love it.I always make a booking and can now do it over the internet a few days in advance. There were four of us this evening. The staff will tell you what size crabs they have if you ask so you can also choose there so you have a rough idea what the costs will be. I ordered small drunken prawns (excellent), small cereal prawns (good to try, sweet, probably don't need them again) great pork spare ribs, unfortunately they were sold out of bamboo clams, superb seafood fried rice and two large crabs one the usual chilli style and the other spicy pepper and salt. It was all fabulous and the crabs were large and particularly good. Washed down with plenty of cold beer and they now have a good wine list as well, so some NZ Sav Blanc.It's not a cheap meal, if you let me do the ordering :-) but as I never know when I will be back, it's always a memorable meal so happy to pay. My three guests thoroughly enjoyed as they are craboholics like myself
4
Went there during Mother's Day. Though there was a queue despite last minute reservation. Though there was a queue, it was cleared very efficiently. Particularly impressed how fast the staff are able to clear the queue. Highly efficient.Food is as tasty as before. We ordered the cold dish, braised ducks with sea cucumber, broccoli, chili crayfish with mantou, satay and Mee goreng. Mee goreng and braised duck with sea cucumber are always on our must order list.Consistent quality over the years
4
it's great to have carbs over there and the service is really good as well,however, a bit crowed sometimes.
the price is depends but in resonable rang.
5
A bit far away from a main part of Singapore, but if you are a seafood lover, you must come to this place. Expensive, but divine and the service is not too bad.
4
one of the few place that serves decent chilli crabs. like many says, 1 crab is good enough for 2 pax unless you are there solely for the crabs. it does not matter where chilli crabs is originated from, so far this is one of the best chilli crabs that I had eaten in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong
5
We have been visiting Jumbo for several years now. It's one of the places we will bring our overseas guests or families to for a taste of local seafood. While prices are not cheap, you do get what you pay for. So far their quality has been consistently good. the best time to go though for dinner is probably before 630pm on weekdays or 6pm on weekends...you get to choose a good sea facing table. To be assured of a table, make a reservation. our family favourites are...1. black pepper crab 2. chilli crab 3. bbq tilapia fish
4
Thought this place was good enough to match the feedback I had got from other people. Service was good but they do get busy. Chilli Crab was good, one was enough between two people. Anymore you will be paying a lot. Make sure you book ahead, we went at lunch and it filled up quickly so I would imagine dinner would be even busier
4
Visited this place for the first time on the East coast. It was a great experience. Tried the cereal prawns, black pepper crab n the famous chilli crab. The preparation was fantastic. If you are a sea food lover you must not leave singapore without visiting this place
4
Food is good. Service has not been as good. Especially for 1 staff who took order, but she was not listening despite she asked us which beer we want, she did not placed the order. I had to check with other staff. We were also not offered any bibs. We had to request for a change of plates. Previously service is not so skimpy
4
I really expected the dinner at JUMBO. Therefore, I made a reservation 3 months before. At the day of my dining, I went to restaurant. They gave me outside seat without any explanation. It was very hot & humid, we wanted inside seat. BUT the server's attitude was unkind. After all, Chili Crab was great enough to forget their unfriendliness
3
The service was good that night.We had many side dishes, fried rice, two 1.5 chili crabs and one 1.5 black pepper crab.. The only bad thing is all the side dishes came out followed by the chili crabs but the Fried rice is not yet served. We had finish two of our side dishes and one half way done. Chili crab is served so we had our hands busy eating it. Halfway thru the chili crab the fried rice is served. Most of us didn't even touch the fried rice cause we are busy eating two chili crabs and the black pepper crab. Don't know how the cook / management place the order of the dishes served.
5
The chilli crab was amazing! We were a bit worried as to the price because it wasn't indicated at the front menu especially knowing how expensive Singapore can be. It ended up being all up for myself and my partner $160 Singapore dollar. That included a fried rice and no alcohol just tea. It was a 1.4kg crab. We thought that it may have not been enough but it was plenty. The crab was amazing, so much meat. Very messy to eat but it's expected. Busy restaurant. We were told there was a waiting time of 45 minutes but only waited 20 minutes but needed to be out within an hour and a half. Food came out quite quick. Staff were pleasant not overtly friendly. Would definitely go back next time we are in Singapore. A must if in the area
5
this place is great if you want to try singapore seafood dishes like the famous chili crab with steam mantous, fried baby squid, seafood toufoo, bamboo clams in garlic. of course this is a chain but the food is pretty decent and enjoyable.
5
The food is fresh, very delicious. The reservation table is very convenient. Environment is very good, can enjoy the night scene.
3
Known as The Place To Go for Singapore's famous chilli crab and a sunset view of fishing and container ships at anchor.Don't expect luxury, but rather plastic tables and fairly brusque waiting staff, with a businesslike attitude and no frills service.Plenty of choice on the drinks front from Chinese tea, beer, wine/champagne to Aloe Vera and Lime. As for the food, personally I prefer the heavily seasoned black pepper crab to the chilli crab drenched in orange sauce. The crab and the cod were expensive but tasty. The baby squid over fried and crispy (apparently that's how it is supposed to be!). My suggestion would be to match it with baby kailan in garlic and go easy on the rice! Be aware, however, that the key ingredients are expensive and the extras can quickly add up (a small fruit platter $10). Our modest meal came to $160 for 2, so not unusual by Singapore standards but certainly not a cheap night out. Overall, an interesting experience that adds some spice to Singapore life! Especially for a group night out. You can book tables inside online (>24/48 hours notice) but outdoor tables with a view are first come first served
4
Very tasty food and the staff was very accommodating and helpful considering our party had one with a serious nut allergy and a vegetarian. We had a wonderful spread of food and it was delicious. This location is right next to a wonderful park which was delightful to go for a stroll before everyone arrived
3
Was there with 7 person for Dinner. Service is sadly poor and they are not very nice. But sometimes I have the feeling because we are foreigner. We can speak little chinese and than the Sevice changed-they were more friendly. But all in all it was a nice experience, but I can not recommend it to everyone. When you enter the restaurant they say how long you have time to eat and sorry, but I really want to enjoy my food (which is not so cheap). My recommendation, say to the waitress NO to the peanuts and jasmine tea-they charge it without saying anything to you. They just place it on your desk without asking! Food is good but I think there are some better and nicer restsurants around Singapore to enjoy the food.
3
Very busy, noisy, bustly, crowded restaurant. Don't go there for a nice quiet 'romantic' dinner! Service was however quite efficient if a bit surly. I guess the restaurant must seat several hundred diners all at once, so be prepared for a 'production lne' dining experience!We went specifically to try their famous Singapore Chilli Crabs & also tried the 'Drunken Prawns'. Don't bother with the latter, tasteless prawns in a rather disgusting broth. The Chilly Crabs were also disappointing, nice suace but small & poor quality crabs.There must be better places in Singapore to eat good Chilli Crabs
5
We have tried to visit Jumbos on previous visits but it has been booked out...we booked ahead this trip are we weren't disappointed. The whole meal was delicious well cooked well seasoned and well balanced.The service was also very good. This is one of the things you must tick off your Singapore bucket lis
4
It is a place, where locals or expats should take friends, who visit Singapore, if they like seafood. Nice location, not very cheap, but I say still good value for money. Locals say, it is overpriced, but I think, it is worth the little more. Sitting outside at the sea, with no premium prices, is okay. Chilly Crab or other fish dishes are a must. I like their small buns very much with the chilly crab! Great place, for a relaxed dinner with a bunch of friends. If you have some beers, calculate about 50 SGD pp (+-). It is just a bit difficult to get there...take a Taxi
4
I have eaten at Jumbo Seafood three times, always with local friends. They know what to order. It was always tasty. I love chili crab, and soft bun that I can dip in sauce. This place can get very busy, so service may feel rushed. Can get expensive if one orders more crabs or seafood
4
In my opinion if there is a truly Singaporean dish that reflects the people and their culture, it is the Singaporean Chili Crabs. One might disagree with me as there are the satays, laksa, and many more with malaysian or indian influences, but no one else makes this type of crab. And when in Singapore, like fried chicken in the southern US, there are many who brags that they have the best. I can't tell you I am the expert in this subject matter but my basis are my taste buds of my youth living in Singapore eating off stainless steel tables. Oh the simpler days of yore. If I have the time I will sample the top 20 places and give you my number 1, alas I only had 3 days. So Jumbo was closest where we hung out. It was also made famous as a stop of "The Amazing Race US". We did not have a reservation so we waited for an hour and sitting outside, it was a torture to watch the crabs come out of a slot under a window right in front of the waiting area. They tell you you can't leave as they only announce your number 2x. So we salivated as we wait and our stomachs growl. But it is worth the wait. I only ate the Chili Crabs and the moment it touched my palate memories exploded in my mind of eating crabs with my hand under the stars of old Singapore. And I savored the sauce like soup and slurped every last drop. Oh and don't forget the side of deep fried bread (taste like beignet) to scoop the sauce, that what it is for. It was spicy and a little sweet just the way I like it. If you only have a few days in Singapore then drop by Jumbo, its worth the wait
3
We were bit disappointed as there was much choice when we dine there. We arrived around 6pm, only available crab was mud crab, no clams! But the fish we had was cooked nicely. We enjoyed the view of east coast!
2
The service is abysmal, and the food atrocious!
The worst reastaurant I'd went during the trip. Never again!
4
A must in Singapore. We eat here every time we visit. Loud efficient fast service. Chilli crab, pumpkin purée prawns, superb. Of course not cheap, but fun, fabulous food
3
Great vibe and large portions but drink plenty of water to swallow the bill ! If you walked a few hundred metres to a nearby foodcourt next to Swissotel merchant court (on top floor shopping centre) you'd get an amazing meal for about 10th of the price - use the change for a boat ride and still come out ahead.servive was just so so too- efficient and non plus
5
What an amazing place to dine!!!Went with locsl friends who basically ordered the whole friggin menu and.......WOWCrabs in 3 diffferent styles, Drunken prawns an absolute must! Crayfish Tails to die for and a local favorite of spicey fish wrapped in a banana leaf, different and delicious!
3
Had dinner here the other night - wanted to go to the Red House but it had closed down. The food was pretty good - had chilli crab (good), baby squid (tasted little old and were 'too' crunchy), drunken prawns (my six year old son loved those!), and some veges. Took ages to get drinks.. our sons lime juice arrived after the crab and our beer not much before. Would go there again though
5
Booked on line via Chope previously but was unable to get there on time. However, when I arrived at the restaurant, the staffs were very nice and I only waited for 10 minutes before I could enjoy my meal. You must try the chilly crab with bread and the cereal shrimp, it's really nice! Overall, a very pleasant memory
5
You have to visit this place about 15 min outside of downtown Singapore. Order the Chili crab AND the black pepper crab. Thats right, you gotta try both. Place is right on the water with outdoor seating. It gets busy, and the price isn't cheap but the food is off the chart.
3
Taste of the food was average but one poor thing is the food is not hot when served. I ordered Scallop Wrapped in Yam Ring, Steamed Bamboo Clam with Minced Garlic and Chilli Crab. Besides the crab, the other 2 dishes is just a bit warm when served. By right all the dishes should be served hot
4
Any trip to Singapore - it is a must to eat Chilli Crab. Jumbo's Seafood on the East Coast is the place. It is right on the coast so the dining area faces the sea. There is also Pepper Crab / Butter Crab if you are not into the hot stuff. Basically any seafood then Jumbos is the place. The service is tops and the menu is packed with anything seafood whatever your preference. It is essential to book as it is very popular
4
Was taken after a very short trip to Singapore for business... Great crabs at a very premium price. Heard from the cab driver while being dropped after dinner that the price is 50% higher... Worth a thought.. Not cheap
4
While food maybe good, the service level is very poor. We have also been reminded many times to finish our food by certain time. Even though time is not up yet, we have been asked to pay the bill first.
4
Restaurant was good, well organised for such a busy spot! Crab and sauce delicious, didn't really try anything else..very pleasant and fun evening
3
Chili crab is super yummy but service is not. Slow and the waiters could care less about you. Also be aware that they charge your bill for peanuts they leave at your table and for hot tea they offer you. Very shady!!
1
Took some out of town guests to the East Coast restaurant to show them chili crab and the park. We ordered two jumbo crabs and other food. They brought one small crab. We figured they would bring a second out. They didn't. Had to stand up and grab some waitstaff to get their attention. First manager just smiled and told me to wait. Second confirmed we had ordered two crabs. Waited ten more minutes, cornered a third manager. 10 minutes later another smallish crab comes out. No apology, no comp for embarrassing me in front of guests by not having enough crab for them and making them wait. Oh well, I got to explain how this is classic awful Singapore service, but not the evening I wanted. I know this review will be lost in the mass, but stay away, there are other options next door
5
The best place for ordering a variety of dishes and sharing among friends. Albeit a chain and service could be better (but that's true in general for Singapore), this is a must stop off for any visitor in Singapore or a great place to celebrate with a big group. I had my first Chili Crab here and looking back, it was one of the best I tried in Singapore and Malaysia. The cereal prawns were an interesting treat, and I enjoyed that there were so many options for crab - go for the salt and pepper too. I'm def coming back for a mega chow down next time I'm in town. Tip, if you can't get into one, there's always another that's likely less busy
1
We had a reservation and want to show our foreign friends a typical sea food restaurant. It was a real desaster. The service refused to bring five glases for a jug of beer so we need to order a second jug, the order was completly mixed up, the food arrived so late that we had to go for a long time only with starters. The jumbo crabs were tiny and the quality only avarage. We got the impression that we were not wellcome and they only want to make money
5
Fish and Seafood is my favorite. Seafood at Jumbo is irresistible for me. Each time I went to Singapore, I made sure I find time to visit a Jumbo outlet. Living in Delhi for last two decades, you would probably understand the temptation of a seafood lover. So my review is tend to be positive. Well, Jumbo never disappointed me. Only challenge has been finding a table during the peak hours.Excellent seafood in Singapore; should not be missed. If it at the east-cost outlet, it would be even better.

We were told that when in Singapore we have to try the Chili Crab and the best place to do that is in the East Coast Seafood Center and Jumbo Seafood was recommended by several people.So, we made our way to Jumbo Seafood and were seated at a table upstairs.Perhaps it was because we had a very small party (3 people) and most of the other tables looked like they had 10 people, but the service was very poor.The wait staff all looked very unhappy to be there (we figured they were probably overworked and underpaid). We had to constantly keep waving our hands in the air to get a waiter's attention for ordering, for getting water, for getting more napkins, for ordering more food, pretty much anything we wanted.We ordered the Black Pepper Crab and Chili Crab. They both tasted good and the sauce for the chili crab was good with rice, but there just wasn't much meat on the crabs. We ended up ordering another veggie dish since we were still hungry. That took awhile to flag someone down to order, then took awhile to arrive at our table. We had pretty much figured they had forgotten our order since the restaurant was starting to empty out and were thinking we should ask for our bill and leave when the veggies showed up.When we got our bill we were a little surprised to see that it was 200 SD for essentially 2 crabs, rice and 2 veggie dishes. A little more than we had been expecting, and much more than we paid for any other meal we ended up having in Singapore (~50 SD). We paid it and chalked it up as a lesson learned

The problem with having good or great reviews is that eventually one gets disappointed. I think we had been told so many good things about jumbo that we were expecting more. The chilli crab was good, plenty of sauce not enough crab. I would have been just as happy with just the noodles, which were yummy. And yes, as a previous reviewer wrote, they put peanuts on the table without you asking for them, but then charge you! Hey ho, guess it can't always be fab
2
This place have goodreputation, but can't understand how? What we saw was unfriendly and sloppy service. We ordered 3 courses and 2 of them were not so good and 1 (Chilli crab) quite good. Pricing was quite high comparing to value.
5
So many people come here。The waiter is very nice，and the food are alldelicious and excellent。I like it。
5
I love the chili crab and the shrimp
And would like to try black pepper crab next time!
Will definitely come back next time
4
Food was of expected standard. Better if seated indoor as leaves kept dropping onto our table due to trees surrounding the outdoor seating area. This period of year, too humid to sit outdoor.
3
The front of house on duty last night (Miki?) was the rudest and most arrogant that we have experienced at any restaurant- and we are well travelled. Spoiled our experience for sure. The service from the floor staff was absolutely fine. Food was good, but definitely priced at a Jumbo premium. We will only go back if we have overseas visitors that insist.

I went to two Jumbo location - Clark Quay and East Coast.East Coast (Mar'15): Went straight from Changi Airport, with rolled on luggage, a short 10mins cab ride away. Restaurant was spacious though busy and I had no problem keeping my luggage with me. It does gets busy past 7pm. Chili Crab was slightly disappointing because I felt the Clark Quay chili crab was better, served in a hot pot with more gravy. The crab shell was also covered with black stain which looks kinda icky. I saw other tables ordered their Razor Clams which looked so good and huge. Will do that next time. Tip: Order some friend mantou to dunk the chili crab gravy with. You can buy a packet of chili crab gravy home. They also have it for black pepper. Clark Quay (Dec'14): Amazing Chili Crab! The gravy is plentiful and so good. I had better dining experience here than East Coast. I felt the chili crab tasted better here
4
The speed of serve the meal is quick, but the price is too much more expensive. If you really want to eat the chilli crab, you can go to another shop which is near the MRT Lavender stop. The shop is more delicious than Jumbo, but the price is cheap. 
5
This is my favorite dinner stop in Singapore. Sitting outside at the East Coast site is just great; Singapore actually seems like an island away from the city. Both the Chili Pepper crab and Black Pepper crab are outstanding. We also typically order the sweet and sour prawns and seafood fried rice. All with a jug of Tiger Beer! Heavenly! I sadly must agree that the service is not great. We waited a considerable time for our crab, although the prawns and vegetables came earlier. The server never brought us the rice we ordered. But when you have sea breezes, good friends, and Tiger Beer you can stand a little wait. Be sure to call ahead to make a reservation. This place is always busy

My mom and I went to their place at the East Coast Park (believe there's another branch at Clarke Quay, there may be more), and we had Chili Crab which was pretty tasty indeed and easy to eat unlike crab in some places where you have to crack and hammer, lol, nothing like that here, so that was a nice surprise! :) For about SGD 70 it cost for the two of us just for the chili crab (and a little bit of rice) even without any drinks except water, I'd say the price was somewhat on the high side (you might say "a lot" on the high side if you compare it to a meal at a regular food court!), but it was worth it for a "treat" once in a while, and yes the view was fantastic too looking out over the Singapore Strait :). In fact, if you stand at the railing beside the promenade in front of the restaurant and look up to the sky, you'll see planes coming in for a landing at the Changi Airport every few minutes (like literally every two or three minutes!).There's a cab stand just a few minutes' walk from the restaurant (walk in the opposite direction from the sea), and it will only cost somewhat over SGD 10 from there to downtown like the Bugis Junction

This was a huge let down.An impressive-looking place. Masses of tables inside and out. Wonderfully noisy, children running around etc, not being a nuisance.  We went with our hosts whom we had invited out to dinner and asked them where they wanted to go. Their children were hugely excited as they adore the crab there and, as locals, go there regularly. We were warned when we arrived that the crab would take about forty minutes and said this was no problem and duly ordered other little bits to eat whilst waiting. The place was packed.  Few Europeans like us and a wonderful mixture of colours races and creeds. What we hadn't bargained for was the unfortunate stream of lies we were fed (sic) whilst waiting.  We were told all sorts of mendacious rubbish and eventually, when nothing had turned up after an hour and a half, we decided to leave. What had pushed us over the edge was that the table next door was being served crab and they had arrived well after us. Angry at this treatment, the couple we had invited, long time Singapore residents,launched into the fray. After some ten minutes of heated discussion with the management, they emerged triumphantly, clutching crabs (no charge) for the children. It seemed that, when confronted, the crab was indeed available and cooked. The children ate thi prize at home. A disgraceful display . Never again
4
We order set dinner, although the size of food were not big but all tasty, the service was good, only one thing was not enough air-con indoor tables, it was too hot for us to eat hot food under hot environment.
4
Good Crab, good atmosphere, enjoyable night.........Must try when you in Singapore
5
Had to have my Chili Crab before leaving Singapore! It was yummy and savory! Other crab dishes are wonderful as well. The tea was really nice too!
4
Food is not authentic but still tastes good. Very busy restaurant, therefore the service is not always good.
5
The food was great, as the crabs tasted really fresh. Service was okay, the people there are polite. Only downside was that there were too many people and that was a little disturbing.
5
well kept ambience.very attentive staff.good service.delicous seafood cusine.the crab dishes are must try .
4
Tried many chilli crab in Singapore, but none of them even came close to Jumbo's. The crab sauce goes very well with man tau (fried bun). That being said, their price is not cheap. 2 people having 1 chilli crab, man tau, prawn, and pak choy, cost around SGD120. But with this kind of taste engraved in my brain, I crave for it when I'm home in Jakarta so I've always tried to visit them once a year
5
this is by far the best tasting sea food, especially don't miss thier chilli crabs & papper crabs...delicious food, enjoyed tilapa fosh dishes tooovery large suptuous protions, quite yummy taste,... its difficult to avoid indulgenece in this restuarant..i had visited their both out lets, one at depmsey hills & another at riverside at clark quay...i enjoyed food more in dempsey outlet...however clark quay offers you otuside seating with natural ambience & watching people pass by you can enjoy your favourite dises...would surely visit this restaurant next time i will be in singapore.
4
When I and my frd ordered the curry crab, we were suggested to get a 2 kg one, but actually this is too much for 2 people and given that we ordered few dishes more. I guess they wanted the guest to get a heavier one and to earn more, but ignore the fact if we can finish
5
If there is one meal that you must have in Singapore this is it.There is a JUMBO in the centre at Clarke Quay, too, but this one has the ocean view and a bit more atmosphere. You feel like you are more down with the localsChilli crab is a must, and the pint of prawns goes down well to
4
online booking is very convenience, environment is good, service is good especially the elder waitress, crab is taste good but a bit expensive, many people visit the shop even weekdays
5
We were there on a Saturday night , 8 people, had to wait but was worth it.
Ordered the pepper and the chilly crab, but prepared beautifully not overly spiced just right.
A bit expensive for the wines but then its Singapore.
Friendly staff.
4
Never fail to order their chilli crab whenever I dine here. It's always crowded, so do make reservation before going.
4
Having dinner at this restaurant outlet is a great choice, sea view, cooling sea breeze makes the ambience one of the best you can get in Singapore. Food quality and service is good, especially their chilli crab and mee goring if you can take spicy food (acceptable level of spicyness; you can ask for mild spicy). All in all, a must go place if you are travelling to Singapore for good food
4
Went here on our last night in Singapore - it was awesome. Sitting outside, by the water in the glow of the big neon red sign...we ordered black pepper crab, chilli crab, satay chicken...food was so good! If you are a wine drinker, you may want to ask for a few ice cubes, that would be my only negative. Would definitely go back
5
I went to there with my friend, it is quite busy always even needs to make a reservation in advance as told by my local friend. While sitting there, you can see fantastic coast line view. The red Spicy Crab is just amazing, I DEFINITELY recommend whoever went to there order one, it is just he best dish I had when stay over in Singapore
4
Went late at night had the set menu with crab chilli and it was good but add beer service charge and it's well over twice the price of other meals I had . Good service but no sense of welcome and to be honest not as good as I have had in Singapore before but still good compared to the world food standards 
3
The quality of the food is good, and it is an affordable experience. Because the restaurant is so popular, the tables are close together, and the noise level can peak. The staff are extremely rushed so the service is not so personal. There is a strong emphasis on table utilisation, so you often feel pressured to rush the meal and move on
5
My brother, who lives in Singapore, took us to this restaurant in Clarke Quay. He told us that this is the best seafood joint in Singapore. He booked a table 7 days in advance.We ordered the famed Chilli Crab, Salted Egg Golden Prawns, fried buns (known as "mantous") and Black Pepper Crab. All the dishes were superb. The Mantous dipped in the delicate Chilli Sauce of the dish was soon good. The crabs were huge about 1.2 kg each and sweet and fresh.The price is on the higher side but the delicious and satisfying meal was worth it. But book your table in advance
3
We had the pepper crab and chili crab. Both were good but the preference was for the chili crab although it is a bit messier. The place was horribly crowded so reservations on their website is highly recommended. There are also two of these at Clarke Quay so you need to go to the correct one for your reservation (we didn't so we were a bit late for our reservation). Also, they tell you what time you need to be finished so they can seat the next set of guests. Ours was for 1 hour, 15 minutes. The service, while functional, was less than friendly. All in all, pretty average
3
Crab was absolutely nice, but service was hard to give same comment,
they all with a poker face, if you ask for recommendation, they will point "set" ...
no other choices...
5
Famous Jumbo restaurant
Serves the best chili crabs we've ever tasted
They cover all the hand bags with cloths
They give you plastic gloves
YUM!!!
5
A sea food factory that serves delicious crabs, prawns, rice ... I enjoyed the Drunken Prawns a lot. The service is a bit slow though.
4
Very. Ice ambiance, busy but not crowded. Close to,the waterfront. Was with Singaporean colleague said; they ordered the best. I really enjoyed the food. Service is not personal. Too many to serve, but OK.
4
all of the meal is very delicious，but the waitress is to busy！and the beer is a little bit expensive～
5
We tried at least 5 different crab places all over sin and this always came out to be the best. they have over 5 eateries all over sin so u can do a Google search and find one close to u. not that things are far apart in sin :) we tried the signature Singapore Chili crab as well as the black pepper crab and both were great. the chili crab comes with a lot of egg mixed gravy which is great with bread but if u want deep flavor with no gravy then u have to try the black pepper crab etc. in my humble opening going to other places could be a wast of time and money. other that east cost all other restaurants of Jumbo might need to be booked in advance especially in the weekends
3
Shown to table and waited for menus but quick service on drinks. Had to wait to place order then wait a long time 50 mins for food- not the best but interesting to see the locals tucking in to monster crabs. The duck salad starter was tasty - cod in spicy sauce and sweet n sour king prawns average. Expensive but seems to be flavour of the month and well worth a visit once
5
AN excellent experience!!We went to the Jumbo Rest overlooking the bay....the views are amazing the night was lid up by the ships docked In the bay.The food, amazing!!! Ok, let's talk about it, the Black Pepper Crab AMAZING! The Chili Crab AMAZING (this from someone that is not used to eating crabs!)The spring rolls....perfect...the small fried squids (if you like seafood taste) were good....The Singapore noodles out if this world!!!The price.....well it's Singapore!!Service a bit confusing....we were a small group of 8....... But hey...it wS a lovely experience
5
Stopprd for lunch. Had to go for the famous chili crab. And several apps. All were great. Also a fun atmosphere. I think its a most do in Singapore. I would recommend reservations. I did not have any. They got me in but i was lucky.
4
I made a reservation online for this restaurant a week in advance of arriving in Singapore for a business trip. I wasn't disappointed. The food was delicious though the chilli crab can be a bit messy so I recommend you bring extra napkins and wet towels if possible. The restaurant offers every customer a bib which is very helpful. The only downside was the meal is a bit pricy- ordered 3 dishes, chilli crab, a small fried rice, a small portion of vegetables between 2 people, and the total bill was about S$130. Advance reservations are highly recommended especially if you are a big party. The walk along the river after dinner was really gorgeous. For anyone looking for a nice meal with great ambiance, this place is not to be missed
3
The famous chilli crab from jumbos was decent. Although pricey the taste was there. Service could have been better. It definitely felt like we were a bit rushed. If you are planning to go be sure to make a booking in advance
5
Food is as good as I image,. if the waiter could be more friendly,that will be great.Still want to visit again if I have chance
2
After dinner, I paid the bill.
However staff gave me wrong change.
He didnt say sorry and so rude...
1
RUDE staff. Rude when picking up calls. Rude when attending walk in s. The Food and atmosphere was excellent, however the staff ruined my experience. The management should do more training for the staff..
4
It was my first time to eat at jumbo restaurant and on a friday night, the place was packed and i suggest getting a reservation ahead of time as the waiting line for walk in customers was long. There were two seating areas, one under a roofed area and the other one near the beach. There was also a private function on the second floor during our visit. We managed to get a table by the beachfront and it made the dining experience more special. The menu showed more of how the dish will look like as the prices of the seafood items were indicated as "seasonal price". It took around 20-30 mins before we get our order of 3 crab variations, 1geoduck served 2 ways (a must try!) and 5 other side dishes. The crab tasted fresh, decent chili crab and black pepper crab. Since the placed is fully packed, the service was a bit slow as servers were not always visible. The entire bill cost around $300+ for group of 10
5
I was told by a local that if I hadn't had Chilli crab at Jumbo's then I hadn't been to Singapore. Be prepared for a delicious meal, a large meal and a very messy meal. For 5 adults we ordered 3 crabs and 2 dozen mini buns. The buns are not exactly healthy but they are delicious. We struggled to finish the crabs, although we tried. Reservations are required. We booked a week in advance. Couldn't get into the two restaurants closest to us. We managed to get a reservation at Waterfront. People were being turned away in droves. Be prepared to finish your meal by a designated time for the next reservation on the table.
5
Always love Jumbo's - we were going to try the city branches but were drawn back to the beautiful setting at the East Coast park. Great food, great views, decent service. Make sure you wear a bib if you're getting the crab - I paid $64 for a decent sized crab (good to gauge when prices aren't always listed
2
Dine in 31.01.15 on river-walk outlet, everything is all right except the award wining chili crab. One kilograms of crab selling S$68. On that night my crab cost S$85 where it mean around 1.2kg for the crab. The crab did not look bigger compare with what i regular have. Price I regular pay for crab are around S$55 - S$60 where weight 700 to 900 grams. In theoretically, it around 50% increase for the crab.

As expat in Singapore, I base my judgement on several Jumbo visits. This is a very popular place because of their delicious crabs. If it wasn´t for them, I would never have done repeated visits here.You can have your table for maximum 75 minutes. Since it always takes time to be served, especially if you order pepper crabs, you often end up speed eating to finish in time and believe me; they will kick you out when your time is up.The service level is unbelievable lousy. In our latest, and for sure our last, visit to Jumbo´s Riverwalk outlet, they forgot our order. After one hour of waiting we cancelled and left, without any sign of crabs.The “service staffs”, new at every visit, seem to be disconnected from what is going on in the kitchen. They are processes driven and they work according to a certain schedule. Everything outside the process gets complicated.Special waiters take your food order, once that is done you hardly see them again, and then you are stuck with the service staffs. If you can get their attention, there is a 50/50 chance that they will execute your order. A third category of staff brings in the food. On top of that there is a special beer lady who only takes orders for beer. It´s a logistical mess!Add to this the high noise level and the busy atmosphere and you realize that Jumbo is in fact a fast food place rather than a restaurant - and an expensive one.Jumbo is definitely no place to go to relax and be spoiled. If it wasn´t for the crabs, there is no reason at all to go here
1
Absolute rip off. No prices for crab ( daily market price) which is rubbish as this place is very big and will have set deals with suppliers.....it's just an excuse to charge what they want. Peanuts and tea was placed on the table as if complimentary and then charged for. My meal came on its own ( with my wife) . Eating utensils for crab came 10 minutes later after I complained that my food was going cold. I crossed out the 'automatic' service charge of 10 % and it was like I'd committed a hanging offence! Not a restaurant just a fast food joint that has delusions of grandeur and certainly charges that way with no respect for the customer....AVOID
4
Good service, very delicious, location is acceptable, price is also reasonable, we will try next time.
5
great choice of seafood and tastes really fresh. The place is always so packed so a great sign of a good restaurant. There are loads of branches around so definately worth going to one.
4
Went to jumbo seafood with my family for dinner. It is a great place for chili crab. Even my elderly parents enjoyed the food there. The service is good too. The price is also reasonable.
4
Good but quite expensive
Many branches in Singapore to choose
Better to make a reservation via chope.co
5
We loved Jumbo East Coast - a Singaporean institution. Chili and pepper crabs, fried rice, satay, belachan kangkong and the obligatory Tiger beer were the order of the night for us and we struggled to finish. Yes, it is expensive (but that is because of the crab) but the food is yum, the service quick and the atmosphere a lot of fun
5
I love this place - the pepper crab (not chilli crab for me) is my favourite in the world; I love the view over the harbour, the outdoor seating, the relaxed but buzzy atmosphere, and every single dish I ever order. Children are clearly welcome and service is pretty good
2
We were in Singapore in December for the first time in over 20 years so of course I looked on TripAdvisor to help decide which were the best restaurants for signature Singaporean dishes. There was a resounding number of reviews for Jumbo Seafood. As suggested by a local expert, I also tried to make a reservation from Canada to the restaurant because it was clear from the reviews that it was a busy restaurant and since we only had 3 nights in Singapore, we didn't want to miss out. I did not hear back from the restaurant even though the attempt was made on their site to make a reservation. Therefore, after we arrived in Singapore, we tried to book a reservation through our concierge. No reservations available but how about just showing up, which we did. Fortunately we were able to get a table after a very short wait--this was at the initial restaurant by Clarke Quay. As we were seated, we were told we had 75 minutes to finish up dinner. I was rather stunned since this meant that it was not going to be a leisurely dinner to savour the crab. Oh well, too late to leave. Being from Vancouver, we have access to Dungenss crab on a regular basis but the Singaporean crab was so highly touted so of course we had to try. To Jumbo Seafood's credit, they are a machine. Once you order, you get your dish at your table within a few minutes. The crab and the minature dipping buns came steaming hot. Much to our disappointment, the flavour was mostly of ketchup to us. Not that impressive at all! Since we were on a short time line, we did not have much time to chat about the crab, which was from Sri Lanka at $65-70 per pound I think. Thankfully, we are experienced crab eaters so we were able to finish our meal just in time. Overall, the meal was a huge disappointment from the flavour to the time restraint. I felt we could have had a much better experience dining elsewhere for $100, which did not even include a drink other than water--crab, 2 dipping buns and one bowl of rice. The credit I give the restaurant is that it is a marketing and operational machine
1
Food serve was cold. Only given 1 hr to complete the meal. Pressurise customer to foot the bill. Do not feel relax and enjoying the meal. Worest service and cold food among all the Jumbo outlet. If there is no action to improve. we will definitely not step into this outlet again. Is Customer service focus or table turn over rate is the priority?
4
The Chilli Crab was excellent the wait staff was attentive once we had ordered, but took awhile to get their attention to order initially. Squid was just ok, but Crab would be enough as you get at least 1.2kg one in the serve and we had 2 with four of us. Make sure you order heaps of the bread buns to dip in the Chilli crab sauce
1
Not sure why this place is so highly recommended - it's bloody awful... probably the worst place we have ever eaten at.It is touristy, overpriced and actually not very good at all... Singaporeans tell me it's just for the tourists and they do a lot of advertising to be well known...We actually felt sick after eating here - nothing was really fresh or healthy and it was just your typical chinese food covered in sticky, gooey sauce...Two of the dishes we ordered had pictures on the menu and they looked nothing like it when they arrived ;-) The cod was certainly frozen and not fresh and the deep fried squid tasted of rotten fish.I know this sounds unbelievable for such a well known restaurant, but I can tell you the other English people sat close by to us were also not happy and arrived after us and left before us... so we were not alone in our thinking! Our taxi driver laughed when we told him we hated it and he told us we should have eaten at the Eastcoast Hawker Centre as it's better, more authentic and cheaper - I wish we'd known that before we spent a fortune here ;-)Definitely not a recommend
5
Always a fan of jumbo. The East Coast branch is always crowded, even on a weekday so make sure you reserve first. Food is good. Just crowded.
4
The location is near the beach so it's nice to sit outdoor.
The chilli crabs and fried baby squids are delicious. With trying.
4
Over the last 4-5 years have gotten accustomed to eat here on the way to the airport before midnight return flight to Denmark. Eating a healthy portion of seafood well before the flight you can go right to sleep once airborne and seafood is easier to digest than meat.Everytime I visit I at least have Pepper Crab with is very good and spicy, but also the razorblades clams are worth a try, other than that I have not had anything I did not want to order again, the food is just so good and fresh. Also sitting outside and enjoying the view of all the ships at anchor is an experience.Can highly recommend to anyone who like seafood, and understand from friends that the Chili Crab is also good
5
Brought overseas relatives to dine last Sept 2014. Ordered chilli crabs, black pepper crabs with other dishes such as garlic prawns, scallops with Brocoli & sambal kangkong with rice.The prices were reasonable for 6 persons at S$250/- All had an enjoyable & most importantly satisfying meal. In fact, we booked a few days earlier as the crowd was good & there was a long queue outside the restaurant. People are willing to wait to get in!The service staff was diligent & good with recommendation of the best dishes. It was good for our overseas relatives to observe the good service provided by the staff & the delicious meal
4
I found my way to Jumbo Seafood(@East Coast Seafood Village) from a recommendation. Located between airport and CBD, the restaurant is right on the water, with a robust menu. I had the local favorite Chilli Crab. The meal comes with a stack of wetnaps and a bib for good reason. A very messy dish, but its worth the work. Crabs drowning in a seasoned sauce, you get your hands dirty by cracking your own crabs and dipping buns into the heavy sauce. Its a good sized dish, so come hungry, and willing to get your hands dirty. :
3
I've so much heard abt Chilly Crab as a famous Singapore cousine. Jumbo is a very popular place for crab. You see there are always so many ppl lined up to get a table, sometimes takes an hr to get seated.I went to one in East coast and order one pepper crep and fried rice recommended by the staff. When the crab cooked in butter and pepper was served, My mouyh was watering. However, when I had a bite... It was so disappointing.. The butter in the sauce was too grissy for me and the pepper was over powering so I barely tasted any crab meat but butter and pepper...Next time, I went to order chilly crab with other couple of other dishes in Jumbo reataurant at Clark quay. Coconut shrimp was pretty nice. You get the sweetness of shrimp underneath of crispy coconut skin. However, chilly crab was not my favorite... (Sad) It was too sweet for me. Both shop provide pretty good service and you would enjoy other dishes as they provide various range of chinese style dishes. But...If you expect some sharp kind of spiciness sich as Thai or Korean food, this is not recommendable... For those who doesnt enjoy much of buttery or sweet flavor from seafood, I recommend some other place such as Mellben seafood!
3
Went there for dinner on 31 December 2015. We had a chilli crab as well as a black pepper one, along with vegetables, tofu, noodles, and sotong. Between the two crab styles, most of us preferred the pepper crab style, although the buns provided with the chilli crab were very good for soaking up the gravy in the chilli crab. Service was so-so, and the pricing was on the high side. From experience, I have never walked away from a crab meal with less than $300 for six people. But then, eating out in Singapore is getting very expensive.Does anyone know cheaper options for chilli crabs in Singapore
2
Frankly, over priced, service average, food wise, well, you can get the same taste for a better price elsewhere. Generally its kinda stressful as it appears the staff are 'rushing' you to finish your meal as there are other patrons waiting to get a seat. Accessibility wise bad. You can grab a cab there but to grab a cab back, you gotta jostle with the crowd and traffic jam within the car park. If you have children who runs around, well, I would strongly recommend to avoid. Its very noisy and it gets worse when children start screaming, it makes the place worse than a market.I have foreign friends who would recommend this restaurants, due to the reviews they get to read on magazines on board certain airlines. My sincere recommendation - Singapore is an eating paradise. Search and google for better restaurants. Chilli Crabs are everywhere but be very careful about the pricing as the pricing tends to have 'hidden' cost. Good luck
5
I was invited to dine at Singapore's best known Seafood restaurant at East Coast. The place certainly lives up to its reputation. The chilli crab was wonderful and so was the pepper crab. The salted egg prawn was exquisite too. It was busy even on a weekday evening so do book a table ahead. A great evening with good food and friends!
3
I went to Jumbo's just for the Chili Crab and was not disappointed with the crab itself, however I was there late on a lunch time period and the staff was rushing to get me out of there which was a little uncomfortable when spending that much money on a food item. The chili crab was flavorful and unique and I'm glad I did that while I was there but wouldn't spend the money again
2
Too expensive, too crowded and too rushed. Disappointing. Recommended by a friend so took advice. I do not like mass catering - the restaurant was more like a a mass canteen.
5
The service of this resturant is very good. The waitress and waiter is very attentive.
The food is nice.
4
this is the best chilli crab ever for me....plus fried bun....yummy yummy..... chili crab is one of singapore signature seafood ....die die must try
5
My friend bring me to here I had try Chilli big crab it is my favorite menu now. I hope I can come to try another menu next time thx
4
This was at the East Coast Seafood centre location.
The food can't be faulted.
The location by the sea is nice, although not the easiest to get to from downtown.
the service is typically average.
4
On line reservation is very efficient and good. However, before Dinner, it is impossible to contact them as nobody will be answering your telephone call. Service during dining is very good. Food is fresh and good.
2
Great service (they made a table available for us) and great friendly service. I had been warned before I got there to watch the pricing of the food as it's done by weight. I explicitly asked how much it would be for Chili Crab and was told $64. However when the bill came it was $92 because 'we had the 1.4kg option'. It was a shame because it was a dampner on what otherwise would have been a lovely evening

Though I went there many times but still felt that it is overpriced. Even the food is nice. The chilli crab is nice but not the original one. As compared to the Roland Seafood (the chilli crab original) this is overrated. But they do use the freshest crab.If u can spend, worth trying it. But it cost you $$$$

We have dinner at Jumbo at East Coast Parkway, East Coast Seafood Centre. This Singapore home grown Seafood Restaurant was established in Year 1987. At present, there are five restaurants in Singapore offering good menu dishes.They are opened from Monday to Saturday at 5:00pm to 11.45pm. From Sunday and Public Holidays, they are opened from 12:00pm to 12am midnight.The weather was quite cooling when we reached the reataurant at around 7:00pm.There are many live fishes, big crabs, prawns and lobsters swimming in the big tank.There are ten of us and we choose to sit on the 2nd floor, with air-cond. service. The first floor has a open-sitting concept. We could see the sea sight not far away from the restaurant.It is getting crowded by then as it is a Sunday and most families tend to dine out. Even though there are ample seats but if you are late, you have to put on waiting list for a least 30 minutes.The dishes that we ordered are mostly their Signature dishes; like Prawns in Cup, Scallops wrapped in Yam Ring, Steamed Bamboo Clam with Minced Garlic, their Signature Chilli Crabs and Black Pepper Crabs, Live Red-Tilapia Deep Fried with Nonya Sauce and Lobster Salad.There are still many other dishes available on the menu.They served hot chinese tea and peanuts as a start. we placed order for orange juices, wine, Cola instead.The dishes are fresh and delicious, but each dish could not cater for ten of us, unless we opt for the large size portion.The serving of food is also quite fast. After our meal, we ordered their Almond Pudding with Loggans as dessert.The crabs are quite expensive as they charged by market rate, but on the whole, the other dishes are quite reasonable in pricing.I would like to recommend this place to tourists visiting Singapore. You will love their Chilli Crabs

Dont know if it's becoming more commercialized without maintaining the standard of quality but it didn't quite hit the mark tonightWe had my usual favorites - chili crab, black pepper crab, yam ring scallops, cereal prawn, Kai Lang veg and seafood fried rice as well as the obligatory man tou (fried bread for dipping into the chili crab sauce)Sadly, tonight the flavour simply wasn't there on all dishes - which was a shame as was looking forward to it allLet's hope it was just a one off..

Food( chillicrab) is very delicious and staffs were very kind. I arrived earlier than my reservation, but i could have dinner immediately. I had a good time with my wife.
3
The food were great but the total atomsphere of the restaurant was too busy. It was little bit hard to enjoy the food. Also, I thought the service was not that gentil enough. It was just average.
4
This Clarkes Quay restaurant is always busy but the service is first rate and well worth the wait for lovers of sea food chinese style. The views from the outside seating are great to.
5
It was so delicious. Even though I don't like the fact that the tea and peanuts were not free, overall it was so excellent. I love this restaurant. Next time I visit Singapore, I want to come here again!!
4
impersonal (each table a approach served by a different waiter) , rushed (order quick-kitchen's closing, pay quickly -we need to close bills) serviceChilli crab was tasty, scallops in bread -not so, venison was great and premium fried rice with seafood had only 10 prawns in large portio
4
Lovely place , make sure that you book in advance as it's always full , the service is fast but not a 5 stars caliber , they have a very high turn over in dinners but the food is amazing as the view is also nice . Do enjoy an Alaskan crab if they have it and remember to order the bun as well .
4
I am not a great fan of seafood, too many bones and shells, however I was taken here and the food was fantastic. Giant prawns, good chilli sauces, pepper and chilli crabs etc. If you are into seafood not a bad place to try. Not sure how the prices rate though as I didn't pay
5
A must have when you are in my beautiful sunny Singapore except November to January where it is raining throughout.Big juicy fresh succulent crustaceans deep fried for a while then sauted in tomato sauce and chilli and simmered with crabs top with eggs cooked abit stringy and served with deep fried buns called man toh...... Hungry.....yes the way to go wash your hands eat it with your bare hands to savour the chunky crab meat dipped in the tomato-chilli base. You want more and never regret having it. It is that finger licking goood.They also offer other dishes such as fried rice, steamed drunken prawns whereby the live prawns are immersed into wine juggled and brought to the kitchen for cooking. After savouring the fresh wined prawns, you will enjoy the hot wined soup to complete this dish.Jumbo has many branches so before you set out it will be good to check with front desk of your hotel which is the nearest one. The branch near Clark Quay has a scenic view of the Singapore River and it is bustling with the water taxi that ferries tourists enjoying our cleansed Singapore River.Please enjoy my infamous Singapore chilli crabs so much so that there are a few restaurants in San Francisco offering it too
5
I been there with my boy friend, and we have a shearing table. We think we have to wait long time to get the food because the restaurant are full of client. But the food come so fast then what i predict. I love the service there. Oh i have no word to describe about the food. That is awesome, veryyyy delicious. We chose a special menu of the restaurant. Well, the price is expensive for me but that is not too expensive for Singapore value. In brief , i will come there again. There is the best Chili Crab i never had
5
Both Black Pepper Crab and Chili Crab are flag ship dishes of Jumbo Singapore. Almost all visitors that I brought to Jumbo love the legendary dishes they have heard off. Black pepper crab is stronger in taste but even my Japanese associates love it. Chili crab is richer and milder. And the Chili crab sauce is best serve with deep fried buns. Try it if you visit Singapore
5
I was impressed with the speed and efficiency of the restaurant. The taste of the food is always very consistent, as I have visited this restaurant a couple of times. A little inaccessible though, so I would recommend driving or taking a taxi.
4
Chilli crabs and location - wonderful atmosphere - don't wear white though - it can get messy eating this wonderful food

Jumbo Seafood gave me a five-star memory, but only because of the food. I was taken as a guest and was told it was the most famous seafood restaurant in Singapore. Upon arrival, I believed it to be true. The massive restaurant was filled to the brim, and there was a long line of people waiting outside. The inside is chaotic and very noisy, and the servers looked like they were in the weeds the whole time. I really had a lot of empathy for them, and hope they get paid well. It should be noted that, while the prices are not crazy for what you're getting (and what city you're in...) they do not match the ambiance of the restaurant. If I were the one paying, I would have hoped for a much classier place.Having said all that, the reason I still give Jumbo four stars is for the food. We ordered the drunken shrimp, black pepper crab, and chilli crab. They were each phenomenal... Very succulent, meaty, and full of flavor. If you enjoy seafood and strong, spicy flavors, this might be worth a shot
5
Jumbo is well-known for the chilli crab. It is a must to eat. Services are good as staff always come to change the plate if it is used after a certain period (piled with food). There are also their drunken prawns and "La La" which is also delicious and fresh. Prices are acceptable and if you are a member of Jumbo, you can also accumulate points to be rebate back to you on your next visit. However, do note that if you would like to have a dinner near the sea, try East Coast Park Jumbo at 4.30pm, you will have a quieter seats and place
5
great food, fantastic location and good service. the crabs are good and so are the lobsters. the rest of the main courses are also very nice. we regularly have chicken and prawns in addition to the general seafood and have never been disheartened. portion sizes are also very generous. the fish dishes are very good especially the sea bass ones. also the hong kong noodles and fired rices are nice.during the evening, it is best to sit outside if of course it is not raining. for lunch would suggest to sit inside but fownstairs as the view can be very nice and not too hot and sticky also if you manage to get a table close to the fan. otherwise might be difficult. suggest you reserve for the east coast outlet as it is normally jam packed
4
3 star for service as the restaurant are just too popular and busy with customers. But yes, we ate chilli crab and pepper crab and golden prawns and some veggies, all are great. We also ordered some mini buns which you can dip into the chilli sauce. Depending on where you come from, the crab is priced acceptable. We also got the bibs to let you concentrate to eat the crab too
1
We went to the Clarke Quay Jumbo because it was recommended as the place to go for chilli crab. Perhaps we were wrong to go on a Saturday night, but it was a disaster. The place was packed, we had to wait in a queue to get in, then share a table with 4 others. The service was appalling, and the food not much better. The famous crab was tasty, but mainly shell, and not a lot of meat, served without any tools to get to the meat, until we asked for them. We were pushed through the meal as fast as possible, with our dessert served before any of the main course dishes had been cleared. There is a lot of choice at Clarke Quay - go somewhere else
1
Visited based on a recommendation of someone we met. I understand that this place is highly regarded due to its famous chilli crab. We never got that far. Confusion reigned by the surly staff over the wine we ordered. Several trips back to the table to confirm had he air that we added it to the menu. They never had it but we're annoyed that we then chose beer instead. Everything else was overpriced. The mixed seafood starter platter at $50 was plenty for two but awful. Over cooked and tasteless prawns and baby octopus with bland spring rolls. Add the dirty tablecloth, lightweight cutlery and the worlds most uninterested staff and we couldn't wate to leave. The whole place had seen better days.

My husband and I were invited here by some business associates from Singapore. The delicious and unique seafood dishes just kept coming and coming. My very favorite dishes were the black pepper crab and chili crab. Huge Sri Lankan crabs smothered in gorgeous spicy sauces. Every dish was delicious but be sure to wear the paper bib if you don't want to wear your dinner home!Very noisy, busy, but fun atmosphere with great service. Perfect for a weekend lunch
5
This should be my fourth times to have crab in my Singapore trip. Specially came to here for our last dinner before going home. We came to Jambo Seafood is for the chilli crab! The chilli crab in Singapore is not that spicy, a bit sweet. The size of crab is huge! I bet you would love it! With the beautiful river view, enjoying the yummy chilli crab, this is what a vacation should be
5
Dined with fellow business associates at the Clarke quay jumbo. Was a treat as the tables where on the banks of the river. The crab was divine and I had to order another one.
5
Food were very good but too rush (fm order to leave only let us hv 1 hr to enjoy)
as eating crab need time.
5
No, this isn't a joke - Jumbo Seafood East Coast makes us return to Singapore each year (this year it was even the 2nd time). I tried many Chili crab, at hawker centers at 'No-Signboard' - but nothing came close to the taste and atmosphere at 'Jumbo'.At the east coast outlet I like that it's relaxed, you might have a seafront walk before or after dinner, watch the illuminated vessels laying here. This time we also tried the Herbal Drunken Shrimps, Hong Kong noodles, Sambal morning Glory plus some other dishes. For all the food incl. soft drinks we paid below SIN$ 140 - a bargain for what we had.The food was, as usual, very good, the Chili sauce which comes with the Sri Lankan Crab fantastic. After dinner you might have to wait in line for a taxi - so better call or book a taxi in advance to avoid the waiting time
4
Had a great meal with a group of friends and the crab did not disappoint. Other dishes were nice too although nothing really spectacular, overall a very enjoyable dinner and like previous reviewers we also washed it all down with a few Tiger beers.Service was also prompt and friendly.You may need to book ahead as this place can get a bit busy
4
A visit to Singapore almost requires a visit to Jumbo seafood for apparently the best chilli crab in Singapore. We visited the Jumbo st Clarke Quay. The overall food here is alright. It certainly isn't the best food we had in Singapore. But we were here for the crab. It was a good sized mud crab smothered in a tomato based chilli sauce. The heat was perfect, enough to know you were eating chilli and give you that familiar tingle on the lips but not crazy hot so you can't appreviate the flavours. The crab was beautifully cooked. Like any crab they are messy to eat. A lot of work required to secure the sweet delicate meat. Service was average at best.Is it the best in Singapore? I don't know as my search will continue but it certainly was good. I would definately go back for the crab
4
Thirteen of us went to celebrate our long-term engagements in Singapore. We had a great evening of superb dishes. I especially loved the Black Pepper Crab, the Chili Crab was too sweet for my palate. We shared a whole bunch of dishes and had a good amount of Tiger beers to wash it all down.A great place for Crabs, no two ways about it
4
This is our second visit to jumbo, having had a great experience at Dempsey, we were disappointed with the service we received. The lady was not very flexible with our ordering and the order was delayed when we finished everything, one of our vegetable dish still didn't arrive. I'd recommend going to a different branch.
3
Went here with the office, and first observation is that the more people you go with, the more fun you will have.Service was on the slow side, and there was a bit of an issue over black pepper crab being substituted for chilli crab. We sent the BP crab back which was accepted slightly reluctantly.On the good side, cereal prawns were stunning - unmissable - rice was excellent, chilli crab sauce was lovely and the little fried buns to mop it up were equally great.Bill was pretty reasonable as we ate fully and drank two jugs of Tiger.Be aware that it is incredibly popular so if it rains, it could be an issue as a fair proportion of the tables are outside.The views over the Singapore Straight after dark are amazing, as you get a true feel of the number of ships at anchor. Quite a sight!Probably a must if you are new to Sing and haven't been to Jumbo before, but go in as party - it's much more fun
5
great seafood delicious & large menu range. Quality of food excellent. Very prompt service and service staff is courteous even though place is full of customers. Price is a bit expensive but still worth the money spent.Very crowded though and need to book early if looking for a good spot in the restaurant.Highly recommended. Happy eatin
5
This is the 3rd or 4th time I visited this restaurant which is located at the East Coast. There are many Jumbo but I found this one the best. This one was popular among local Singaporean as well. It is famous for black pepper crab. The last time I went there was at least over 4 years ago. I am glad that all the food are still so tasteful. As for the black pepper crab that I like more, the cooking is just right, tender and juicy. Not like some restaurant, overlooked and meat dried off
4
Ordered the Chili Crab and never fails to disappoint. Was over satisfied with the quality of the cooking overall.
5
As usual, ordered the famous chilli crab which is the must and tasty as usual. However, it is not cheap !!
4
Good food but price became expensive even compared with 5-6 years ago....It is good for business dinner but I won`t go there for private.
3
that is a delicacy food in singapore but I think taste is normal.....
and the waiter give us just 1hour for dine... so we had to eat Faaast so uncomfortable....

Jumbo Seafood is a household name when it comes to having seafood in Singapore. With numerous branches and a strong brand-name, it is safe to say that they are one of the most famous Chinese seafood restaurants in town. The food is generally good â€“ from the famous chilli crab with deep fried mantou, to salted egg yolk prawns, the crispy baby squids, and mee goreng. We frequently go to Jumbo because to bring overseas visitors. Sometime we find a little too commercialize and touristy. If you are planning for a seafood feast, go to their East Coast outlet. Otherwise, the branch at Riverside Point is also good. This is the place to go for chilli crab, black / white pepper crab / egg yolk crab If you have enough people to share, I suggest you to order a bigger size (i.e. 1.5 kg), which the claw is more like a piece of steak and is much more fulfilling...sometimes sharing a 900g crab by 2 is not so enough. There are 2 Jumbos around Clarke Quay - One is right at the river side which is more open and the view is better, good to go with client / foreigners. The other one is at East Coast Seafood Centre it is less crowded in terms of seating but usually serves 3 rounds everyday....Anyway all serve the same food with same high standard. Booking is needed. The food in Singapore blows me away, and it is best at Jumbo, it was a shining star though, but it is pricey
5
I had dinner with my colleagues at Jumbo seafood. Ambience was fantastic, and food was very tasty, though little overpriced. Black pepper crab was one of the best I have ever tasted. Chilli crab was great as well. Will definitely recommend this to all seafood lovers
1
The only plus for this restaurant is its riverside location. It charges twice the price for food that others do better. You will be charged for extras that most other restaurants would consider complimentary. To top it all the waiters really don't give a damn. Avoid unless you are desperate.
5
Had a chance to try both the Black pepper crab and the Chili Crab here. I am sold on both. the restaurant delivered on its promise of a great meal. the place was very lively and their outdoor tables were fun and comfortable. I highly recommend this restaurant
3
We booked a table for two to try the famous Chilli Crab and can report that it was excellent and the location was also pleasant (by the creek). The service however was poor and this seems very unusual for Singapore. It started when we asked the waitress what she recommended we order with the Chilli Crab. Her response was "whatever you like" - not helpful! We visited on a Sunday evening so it was busy and did not mind the long wait for food. What was not good was the difficulty getting the attention of staff when more beer was required! Particularly irritating when a lot of staff were standing around messing about with one another.To seal the bad service, they took my credit card away for a very long time, which was worrying when all the security instructions are not to let the card out of your sight! After a little pressure the card was returned with the message that it had been declined! Slightly worrying when were planning to use it to pay our bill at Raffles the following day. We paid in cash and left. On returning to our hotel we rang our bank in the UK (good old Skype!) and they reported that the card had not been presented and assuredly not rejected
4
We liked the Chilli Crab and the Tiger very much - although the service was a bit challenging at times. Cant say how much it cost as it was paid for by work - but all the food provided was of an excellent standard and the was plenty provided
3
There waiter was nice，but the environment of outdoor seat is not too clean .
Chili Crab was fresh and good tasty，but it was not really well worth it's value.
4
Don't expect fancy seating or white tablecloths and napkins. :) This venue is one of my favorite in Singapore because it is relax and chill + ideal to enjoy the best chili crab in town with a view by the sea. Besides crab, they have also an assortment of fish and other types of crab (ginger & onions is also very good). Finish the evening with a walk after dinner by the water and you have a lovely chillax night out. :
4
I have eaten at Jumbo Seafood in the East Coast Centre several times while working in Singapore. When I was first there about 10 years age it was no more that a big shed with a iron roof. - still I was advised by my local colleagues that it one "one of the best" in Singapore - and so it proved to be. The inside of the place has been tidied over years but, in the evening, it's still best to sit so you can watch the lights of container ships waiting to unload. So many! Oh yes! My favourite dish has to their Pepper Crab. If there's enough in your party try the famous Chili Crab as well, but in my opinion, the Pepper is tops
5
If you love seafood - and Chinese food, then this is the place for you. It was packed when we got there, and it is best to book, but we were lucky. The crab seems to be a favourite - served in a variety of sauces. The Chilli Crab is fantastic, and the salted crab as were the steamed bamboo clams. There are a couple of Jumbo Seafood outlets, the one we went to was the East Coast Seafood Centre
4
Who would have thought it? Jumbo's Seafood in Singapore can boil crabs to satisfy the Louisiana palate. Go early -- 5:30 seating is delightful as you sit outside by the river. We had both the black pepper crabs and the chili crabs. Our table of nine was divided as to which was best. Service was good. Our children who live in Singapore did all the ordering and paying, so I don't know anything about the price -- can't comment on value, but we all had a thoroughly enjoyable evening
1
Dinner at Jumbo was a colossal disappointment. We were going prepared to spend given that Jumbo has a reputation as 'the best chili crab in Singapore.' We were even forgiving that we were given a table next to the serving station which had a bad smell and which was a constant source of crashing dishes. But what is forgivable ends there. The service was truly horrible. We couldn't get a waiter to come to the table - total eye avoidance. And then when we did finally stand up to get someone to come over (after craning our necks and asking for our server for about 15 minutes), we asked the natural question someone who has never been there might ask - 'can you please explain how ordering chili crab works?' Our waitress replied with a frown and obvious disgust, "One crab, three people." So we asked if people typically order sides with the crab, and she repeated, "One crab, three people". I'm not exaggerating. We proceeded to order three smallish sides for the three of us to go with the crab, and one beer each (of course only two came and it took another 15 minutes for the third to arrive despite that we had our order repeated back to us to confirm). Then,, no more service the whole dinner. When the bill came, it was $145 - for one crab, three beers, and three small sides. The crab was mediocre at best, with enough meat for maybe three toddlers. I would estimate it was about 2 fork fulls each, at most. The service staff acted as if our being there was a total annoyance. My suggestion is to go somewhere that isn't a bloated chain restaurant feeding on tourist hype to get your chili crab - this place just doesn't live up to expectations
4
Go early if you can... It is a very busy restaurant. We were given a time that we had to leave by. Dining experience was 2 hours, so that was fine with us. Service was quite good...we didn't have the chilli grab as we thought to expensive. What we ordered was great and too much for us to eat all of it.. As I watch the comings and goings, very quick to seat people waiting.. This restaurant also has take away with large queues for that as well. So be prepared to wait for either. We will go again
2
Had a terrible and expensive Dinner with my friends from overseas. We arrived late 10:30. They told us its not a problem as the restaurant is open till 11:45. But it was. Terrible Service. Lots of noise as they closed down the whole restaurant while we were eating. All chairs and tables to go inside. Was so noisy you could not conversate any more. Then in the middle of our dinner while were eating the wanted us to settle the bill. We were then already humbling allowed to finish our meal. Just finished, they wanted to move away our table as well. In case they want to close before 12pm they should not accept any guests after 10:00pm. Totall waste of money as this destroyed the whole evening!!!Go to other places where the aymoshere is much more friendly and less money driven
4
Really, a nice open air location and good food options. We did do the touristy Sweet Chili Crab which I did not like, but I had to try it. It's more that it was slathered in so much sauce and I think it's the dish itself, not the restaurant's fault.Everything else we had here was fantastic, including the little bread rolls, crispy fried baby squid, and green veggie side dish.Service was really great and they offered up suggestions for what to order based on our preferences given. I rated this 4 stars due to the service
5
Have been to Jumbo several times, and the foods getting better and better. The atmosphere was overwhelmed with the good service, just that the chili crab I order all the while the price getting ridiculously expensive which double the price that I used to eat! I hope Jumbo won't increase the price in future but lower the price. Thank you. Grac
4
Eating fresh seafood outdoor with an ice cold beer while looking out over the sea .....it does not get any better! Must order chilly and black pepper crab as part of your dinner!
5
It's so good, both for the food & service, we would like to eat again when we get to Singapore next time....
5
food are very delicious, and the traffic is very convenient, the environment is very clean, and the service is very nice
4
we got a place very promptly, the chilli crab and fried buns were excellent and of course great service too.
4
Curry crabs is a delicious one. A bit pricey though. Fried vegetables - morning glory is another dish we love so much. Great seafood place.
4
Better priced and recommended above their other outlets in the City. Returned here after a yearâ€™s hiatus and was not to be disappointed by the black pepper and chilli crab which was meaty and very well cooked. The waitresses recommend Satay which was not good at all (cold and tough with no taste). Stick with the seafood at a seafood restaurant
4
If you are foodie and would love to find the best food, no matter how much research needed or how far away it is, you CAN FIND BETTER PLACES. But if you just want to try Singapore food and do not have time for careful research/hunting, THIS PLACE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWNThis is restaurant is very famous. Food not bad, you can try all the authentic Singapore cuisine (Chili crab, black pepper crab, frog.. etc). It is expensive, if you have a lot of seafood. Chili Crab is among the top 10% level in Singapore. Service is okay, but there are always so many people so they may be in a rush. ABOVE AVERAGE, but a bit expensive. (S$30-150 per person depending on your order
3
It's ok. Nothing special for Singapore scene, maybe touristy. Good food, atmosphere very casual. Price in line with market, maybe on high side. Don't expect 4 star service, in the end you're just another customer.Good to try, not sure I'll return.No kidding, do wear black or dark shirts, these crabs tend to paint you over..
4
We were a family of three in transit on our way home from a holiday on Bali. The restaurant is just 15 mins with taxi from the airport, so if you have a few hours to spear, this is a good place and area to spend them. The restaurant has an outdoor area which is overlooking the busy harbour. We ordered three different dishes, and they all tasted nice, especially the chili crab which they are known for. However, the dishes were all supposed to be served at the same time, but were served one at a time so we couldn't enjoy our food togheter. We even had to remind them about the last dish, which was for our child. Sloppy service, but nice food and location
4
Jumbo has a very good chili crab. I think the best from what I've tried in Singapore. But this restaurant is far from comfort. It's crowded and always has long queue. We even have to shared table with other 2 group family.All staff work fast, friendly and helpful, but still I hope they make bigger restaurant, make it more comfortable
5
Oh my gosh, every traveller should experience the Chilli Mud Crab. Just so yummy. The staff were so friendly and accommodating, the service was efficient and couldn't be faulted.
4
As usual, my favourite hangout for chilli crab will be nonetheless, JUMBO. Chope makes it even easier to make online reservation.
5
my friend & i ate 1kg crab.
crab is very nice.
crab source and fried rice are mixed. then, it's perfect.
5
Chily Crab was excellent, marvellous and magnificent. But there is always a queue and you must wait from 10 to 30 minutes to get the tasty food^_^
1
Concierge booked a table, guaranteed reservation as we left the hotel. Arrived at the bustling and somewhat overcrowded restaurant only to be told we would have to wait in a queue for 30 mins. Didn't bother.
2
To be fair, I'm not a seafood fan to begin with, and this place isn't terrible, and it's got a great location, right on the shore. But the food is overpriced and some dishes were downright bizarre, the service disorganized, and not what I was expecting for the price we paid. Better places to go in SIN to experience the local flavor
4
we went to the riverside restaurant and ordered chilli crab and a few side dishes. the crab was amazing, far too spicy for our normal taste but it was so good we kept eating it. the side dishes (chicken dish, noddle dish) weren't anything amazing, but still nice enoug
5
So I was never massively into seafood, but the crab at jumbo is special - it sort of feels like a spiritual journey. The chili crab is sweet and spicy, its hot but in a pleasant, loving sort of way. Its fragrant and spiced well; its beautiful. The black pepper crab is a completely different flavour palette; its salty and gets its heat from the pepper. The meat is always tender, its great.Keep in mind, like everything else in Singapore - its expensive. You could get the same thing anywhere else in south east Asia for about 1/5th the price. But that doesn't matter, you have to make the trip
4
Take in the view of the container ships parked offshore while indulging in some great crab and seafood. Non seafood dishes are a bit average, but then you should go to Jumbo for their Prawns, Crabs and Lobsters. Sightly on the pricier side but they make it worth while through their service, location and quality. Humongous portion sizes too
1
Turned up by chance on Thursday 9th October, told an hours wait or join a big table with others. Chose to do so and had a great meal, black pepper crab was amazing however service could have been better, little slow bringing drinks and had to ask for the bibs! Otherwise the food is well worth i
2
Waiters failed to deliver our ordered starter, left us sitting with empty glasses until called for and paid overall little interest in our well being.
Luckily the chilly crab was as it should. That is the only reason for not leaving a blank 1 score.
5
Love to keep on coming back to this restaurant everytime I go back Singapore!
The prawn with salt egg wow...and the chili crabs...I can't forget it!
5
Good!
I like the food, staffs...
I was satisfied for almost all.
visited 03 October 2014
from seoul, Korea
3
The waitress is good. But I was urged to pay the check after dinning time 1 hour . It seems they have table time limit 1 hour? Too expensive~
5
Expensive by Singapore Standards? It is, but the Singapore Chilli Crab here is great, as is the Black Pepper Crab. I haven't been to the other restaurants in the franchise, but the Jumbo on ECP is very good. Take in the view of the container ships parked offshore while indulging in some great crab and seafood. Non seafood dishes are a bit average, such as satay, but hey, if you're coming here, it's for the seafood

On a previous visit a few years ago we remember a delicious seafood meal out in Jumbo East Coast Restaurant. So on this visit we wanted to treat ourselves. Service is efficient, , menu choice adequate, location spectacular but food was very poor. We had chilli crab( supposedly a speciality ). The sauce was a prepared glutinous gunge of mainly tomato that almost solidified as it cooled to room temperature. The black pepper prawns ( we opted for deshelled ) were deep fried in a very synthetic orange looking batter. We also had a plate of stir fried broccoli, 2 x Tiger beers and 2 x lime juice and the whole bill came to 150 Sing$ - that's about 75Â£. That's extortionate for bad food even if it is crab and about 8 prawns. I mentioned our disappointment to two members of staff and neither was interested in hearing how or why.My advice - look around and choose another restaurant. Jumbo, whichever branch in Singapore, is past its sell by date. Another reason for not going is that they persist in offering shark fin products. The shark fin industry must be stopped and its the Chinese clientele who consume
3
Well, for seafood and crabs right next to the waters, there's not many choices. It is easier to book at this branch compared to the other branch not so far off.I made booking via internet. Lady dealing with bookings and walk in guests could be more friendly other than saying oh, your booking is for 8pm and it is not yet 8 so pls wait. It was 750pm, so? then 2 min before 8pm, she calls my name and then immediately say must return table by 930pm. Cant say that manner builts up anyone's appetite. What do you think? Maybe restaurant is making so much money that it doesnt matter anymore? Does courtesy kill?Once inside, the change is obvious. Lady taking order is prompt though very busy but totally efficient so as the serving staff.I will come back again when I have the urge for crabs.... hopefully the front lady would have learn more manners then

Second time to Jumbo East Coast and was a little disappointed this time round. We took the late dinning option at 8:30pm and to their credit we were in our seats at 8:30. That's where the credit ends. The order took 15 minutes for someone to come around and take it. We ordered a hub of beer from a lady who never came back, we ordered again from one of the old tiger lady's and it took 10 minutes. Then we were able to order our meals, 2 crabs, 1 Chilli and 1 Black pepper. Advised it would take 45 minutes!! We eventually got our food at 9:30 by which time we were staving. The crab was good as always but the service and price tag leaves you with a sour note at the end of the evening.
4
Great food, specially the crabs. Its not an upmarket restaurant and don't expect 5 star service! the service is acceptable. The food is great and the location is great as well. Absolutely recommend. Be ready to dig in so dress in relaxed clothes to be able to enjoy
2
The food was good as it was supposed to be but the service, with the exception of the 2 elderly crews who attended to our table, fall below one's expectation of how dining in such a restaurant should feel like. The reasons are as follows:1) I had a special request regarding the view for my family who are visiting Singapore for the 1st time ... but as though to teach me a lesson for making such a request, we were given a table at the corner beside what looked to be the dirty kitchen. Partly my bad as I do not frequent the area and should have not taken internet's info at face value...thus, the dinner experience was just so-so. Hence, for those who want to have a better view of the river, I think you ought to visit the Riverside NOT Riverwalk.2) when I approached the hostess, she asked me to wait 3 minutes which elapsed and still nobody ushered us to our table. When I approached again, she had forgotten about it.... say what?!!! We had been standing there in her view for quite a while and she forgot?! I don't recall her name being Dory with a short term memory loss problem ;p3) when we reached our "table with a view" the chairs were not even arranged properly. After waiting more than 3 minutes, it was still not set at least to look like a decent table.There are lots of room for improvement but I will not dine there again to see if indeed this comments were taken into consideration.We had a reservation on Sept 28, 2014 at 7:30 PM. I was not able to get the names of the 2 elderly crews (female and male) but if somebody does look into this, note that they were the only ones who did their job well that night and I do hope they will be commended for it.

A bit distant from MRT stops.. But well worth a taxi ride for an excellent sea food dinner.. Crab, squid, clam.. Very good variety.. Also, nice sea facing seating to relax on an evening
5
Didn't like to stand in a queue. Chill crab was pretty good - not so spicy and delicious. An excellent location on the riverside.
4
Had a family gathering few months back at East Coast outlet. Chilli crab was delicious and not too sweet unlike the ones that I've tasted. Service is good but can be a bit slow when it gets crowded.
2
My wife and myself like seafood and were looking for a place around Katong to eat selected the East Coast Sea Food Center. Spoke to reception and taxi driver and they recommended Jumbo SeafoodRestaurant. There are about four seafood place here. Selected Jumbo's as it was recommended and on the waterfront. As we arrived at seven o'clock no problem getting a table. Not much room between tables. Chinese Tea and peanuts placed on table. Were not told you had to pay for them. The menu had a good selection but over half the items stated "at market price". We did not want to ask the price as we knew they would be dear based on the prices at other restaurants we visited.Selected items that were priced, One dished we selected was the deep fried squid, it was tasteless. The waitress did advise only to order small portions, which we heeded. The prawn rice was the better meal. Service was quick but no personalised service. when we left the place was full. Overall felt that that we could enjoy the same food in Australia with better service and perhaps at a cheaper price
3
Long queues don't mean the food is good. The food isn't bad but it certainly isn't good either ! Chilli Crab was very mediocre , better in many places ! Sticky starchy sauces reminded me of Chinese Restaurants in the west that serve Chop Suey and sweet and sour everything !Service was a 3 out of 10 ! Really can't understand why people wait to eat there !
5
This is a big restaurant but there are enough staff to cater. We ordered the chili crab and it was yummy. They give you a bib so you can dig in and enjoy! Reasonably priced. The location is right on the water and very nice. Worth going to we had a great time
1
The spacing between tables is too little, we do not have much space to move and we need to sit very close to the table as another person (stranger) is sitting right behind you. The waitress (probably from China) is very rude, she is very unwillingly to serve us. Lastly, the foods (8 course dinner) come out so fast that the table has no space to place the dishes. We need to eat faster to clear the table. We feel like they are chasing us away quickly so that the table can be used for the next customers. All of us have no mood to eat and this is the last time we going there. This definitely cannot be a family gathering dinner
4
Been to thus branch for third time in last 2 years. Still as good. Booked and reserved seat 2 days ago and it was still packed and still needed to wait 45 mins for the table so be prepared. Crab crab crab. Other dishes were just so so. Will sure go back next time though :
4
I frequent this outlet as it is by the seafront. Depending on the time of the year, you may enjoy a nice sea breeze. I would not rate this restaurant any higher than the average seafood restaurants as they all serve a reasonable good dish of our signature chilli crab, to say the least. As varieties is key, would recommend that there should be at least 4 diners. So do not expect a quiet place conducive for a chat
4
We had been told by a number of people back home in Australia to try the Chilli crab in Singapore. After surveying cabbies, this restaurant seemed to the most popular. The concierge at our hotel tried to book a table at the the restaurant at Clarke Quay but it was booked out, he managed to get us a table at the same restaurant at the Riverwalk instead. We ended up choosing the salt and pepper crab, prawn and sugarcane sticks, egg fried rice and an amazing duck and mango salad. We sat on the outdoor terrace and enjoyed the food and the attentive service. Roughly $94 Singapore dollars. Please note that the peanuts on the table we assumed were complimentary, were not - we were charged for them, really an unneecessary thing to do and showed a lack of good will. This was a pity as this was otherwise a great meal
4
I made a reservation from the website.the food is good.the service is good.3 people spent $175 there.but the restaurant is a little bit crowded.
3
Your Review
Chilli crab was worth the visit & made up for abrupt service & overcharging (eg for the peanuts we didn't touch)
4
We are regulars at The Jumbo at Riverside Point. Consistently good chili crab and other seafood dishes but we always order the chili crab which is the best in Sing. Great seafood friend rice as well. Outside table seating can be a bit steamy but there is plenty of ice cold Tiger beer to keep things cooled down. Always busy in the evenings so either go early, make reservations or be prepared to wait for a table. Service is good but can be sporadic when things are bustling. Not a cheap place for seafood but well worth the price
3
At best the food was average. I have lived in HK and find the sea food dishes in Lantau more delicious and fresh. I feel Jumbo seafood is a tourist trap and they tary and pass you food which they try to pass as fresh and authentic but I would tend to disagree. The place was loud and not conducive to conversations and the greens were not that fresh either. All in all I would pass and instead go to No signboard seafood at Esplenade
4
It was very crowded. I managed to make a reservation, but told we had be out by 7:30 pm, which made us have an early dinner. If you are prepared to wait, you could go there without reservation, but it is good to have the reservation. The service was rather slow and we had to wait for a long time to order. Once we ordered, the food came in pretty quickly. As it is crowded, it is better you order what you want when you manage to get attention from the staff. Food was good. It was a great gathering with friends
3
The food is decent. Service is ok. View of the sea is priceless. Cost of the meal is pricey. You get better value for money 10 mins away at East Coast Lagoon Food Centre (most locals go there). Some locals will bring foreign friends to Jumbo for it is well know by tourists. Most business people will bring their overseas colleagues to Jumbo as the company picks up the bills
4
We go often to Jumbo Seafood on East Coast Park. (Been in the one near Clark quay as well but not as good.) The children love running around after having some food.We love the black pepper crab, the special rice, the kai lan veg, scallop with broccoli and etc! We always have to ask the rice to come with the rest of the food. Often they serve the rice last. The tables could be spaced a bit more between each other, could feel slightly intimidating....Service is normally very good. In general I would say is a must visit place in SG. Not cheap but food is always fresh. If you having take away: Worth checking the boxes, we ordered broccoli with scallops. When we reached our picnic spot and opened the box: only broccoli inside, no scallops:))) On another occasion one of the boxes was missing completely. I wouldn't suggest they've done it on purpose though, we've just been unlucky I suppose:-
3
Jumbo Seafood was very popular and crowded. We didn't make a reservation so had to turn up and wait. The wait was not too long so this was not a big problem but we were told we only had the table for 1 hour and 10 min which might have been OK but the service was pretty slow and if we had wanted to eat more it would have been a problem.The Chili crab was excellent and worth the wait and I guess you could say the place had atmosphere in a sense. Not really my kind of restaurant. But I might go back next time I am in Singapore unless I can find a better recommendation for crab (perhaps further out of town)
5
We were recommended to visit Jumbo for Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab. This restaurant is really busy but they are very organised and we had a very short wait and then taken to a good table overlooking the bay. The crab was delicious and the gravy sublime, soaked up with the little buns that you can order to go with it. The duck and mango salad was a delicious starter.Don't wear your best dress though it is a pretty messy affair eating the crab. They do give you a bib and you really need it.Should be done once
4
I had dinner with my wife at Jumbo Seafood on 21st. September 2014 and found it to be an enjoyable evening. The food we chose was really excellent. We had the delicious pepper crab, chilli prawns and fried rice. Although the restaurant was busy that night we were served our meal in reasonable time. The waiters were attentive and courteous. All in all it was an excellent evening. I would strongly recommend Jumbo Seafood (The Riverwalk) to all who enjoy good seafood and pleasent service, not to mention a scenic venue
4
The peppers and chilly crab were out of the world. The only drawback is the pricing at its a bit steep. Avoid the cheese crab and it gets a bit rubbery if not consumed while hot.
4
Compared to the one at East Coast, i find the seafood here is fresher and more tasty. We were given a room and the service was fast. There was some hiccups with our reservation but it was quickly rectified by the staffs.
4
I've dine many times at the riverwalk outlet and its great.
But the crab wasn't up to the usual standard on this occasion.
2
Crazyly overcrowded and popular place, but I don´t really get why. It´s extremely overpriced and the food is just so and so
3
Food and service is good. But a number of food items that I want to eat is sold out but thw time I ordered (ard 8pm) so go early if you want to have the full range of items available.
5
Jumbo seafood on the east coast is the more emblematic of the jumbo premises, and I think the place the open Air tables, works for it . Of course pepper crab, chilli crab with man to to be able to have some sauce on this fried Chinese bread, are the absolute must. But also the sticky calamari as appetizers, bok choi and many more . I have seen many disappointed reviews but this place, like an old friend , is something you forgive its flaws easily
1
Food is standard, can be found at other places. Price is too much, although similar to other seafood restaurants. Huge service tax here though, I wouldn't even leave a 5cent tip after. Service was horrible, and I cannot stress this enough. We were having starters and were taking a break before ordering the main course (because we ordered a lot) and the servers bring the bill and ask us to pay. We hadn't asked for it, and I tried to tell them that, but they did not speak English (other than enough to take the order). Now if the place was crowded, I would understand they wanted a high turnover and poeple not to loiter, but both indoors and outdoors were quite empty (we had gone at lunchtime to the Boat Quay Branch), so it made no sense and was very rude. After trying to explain to them that we were going to order after, and failing to do so, we asked for the menu and ordered our main course. Once we ordered it (because we are big eaters), the waiter said 'too much food', and we had to convince the waiter to just take our order without any questions. When we did it, we finished the food, proving the waiters wrong. And then we paid and left straight away. While I did use to go to Jumbo a lot, I feel I'm going to switch to another seafood place (even though prices might be similar), at least the waiters and staff will be more gracious and friendly and will know how to communicate with people of other nationalities.
5
Been dropping in the Jumbo for years, always the same great drunken prawn, chilli crab., kailan, seafood fried rice ordered and the same great quality delivered with great service! Prawn prepared at the table with rice wine then off to the kitchen, back prepared just right. Crab followed quickly; don't forget the bib, as the work ahead is a bit messy!! Overview of the sea was terrific. All was well!! A great dinner & not to be missed
3
Since I did my research before coming here, as soon as we sat down we asked a waitress whether the peanuts and wet towlettes were being charged. As soon as we said that she silently took those two items plus the tea cup away. As we were ordering she gave no response at all to confirm our orders. We only ordered a chilli crab and 10 mini buns, as there was only two of us. The crab was 61 SG and each bun was about 0.60 SG. I would say that price for size of the crab they gave us was kind of steep. Overall the chilli crab did taste really good. I would say its for a visit to try it, but just remember to tell them to take the peanuts, towelettes, and tea cups away if you don't want to pay extra
4
Ordered chilli crab and salad sauce prawn. Chilli crab was great, meaty and juicy. The sauce was delicious. Salad sauce prawn was kind of a miss. Fried battered prawn in thick mayonnaise with one or two pieces of rock melon. Should have ordered a different prawn dish. Prompt service. Only gripe was that we were given only an hour 15 mins at our table, because the next seating would be abt an hour and a half after ours. Not anyone's fault but...1h 15mins is simply not enough time to savour the chilli crab
4
We are spend mid-autum festival evening on Jumbo seafood restaurant. It's a wonderful time the singapore river，the full moon and chill crab. And we met a waitress who came from shandong china，she is very kindly.
4
Chilli crab was really good but eating time given was very short to finish eating.
Even your shop is busy and so popular, plz give your guest enough time to eat.
4
Almost people come to eat chilli crab and so do I! You can swallow your tongue with the dish! the crab is fresh and its sauce is speechless.
The minus thing is you must wait for a while to be served.
5
The crab is good, and there is an old waitress who works hard to serve us, which make us feel great.
4
Staffs there are nice & helpful.
A chinese female manager there is awesome! She can speak in Cantonese, English & Mandarin!
4
1) Mango Salad with shredded roasted duck - refreshing and full of flavours - great appetizer
2) Yummy chilli crab with fried "mandou"
3) Fried tofu with seaweed and mushrooms - tasty and yumilicious
4) Spicy fried Cod fish in cubes - love it
3
We had Chilling crab, 炒飯 and フカヒレsoup. Chilli crab was 68S$.The food was really good, especially 炒飯!! the small size was much enough for 2 people. We had been there nearly its close time. All clarks are preparing for close, and none said "Thank you" or anything. Disappointed.I thought the service was not good. But I can say that that's because I'm too familiar with Japanese service mind...
5
Singapore's famous for their chilli crab and I couldnt have found a better place to try it.We didn't make any reservations so we had to wait 15 minutes for a table but it was totally worth it.Had the most amazing chilli crab. It was so delicious I wanted to go back for more! Big sized portions. It wasnt cheap but it was worth it. Must try
4
The resaurant is basically a shed looking out over the sea, but the food is very good. The opposite of paying a high price for a spectacular setting but ordinary food.We had the shark fin and crab soup and the obligatory chilli crab. Good sized crab for the two of us and the price was quite reasonable.Sadly not open for lunch except on Sunday so we wasted a trip on Saturday and two other groups showed while we were there - missed opportunity
4
No wonder this place along the Singapore River south of Clarke Quay is always full and with people queueing: the seafood is excellent and the service is quick. Do not miss the crab (any style you want), but also consider the Fish Fillet with Ginger, a cheaper alternative if you are not into crostaceous
5
Delicious Food!!! If you visit SG, must go. I order their recommended dishes, chilli crabs, scallop wrapped in Yam Ring, seafood dry noodles is so good taste.

It was a nice night. Black pepper crab was HOT! Cod fish n sambal kankong was nice. It was crowded for a monday night but staff was very efficient and fast.
4
Black pepper crab is a specialty dish and must try! Chilli crab was awesome too! Must try for travelers to Singapore. Staff service yet to improve though!
5
The place was recommended to us by a taxi driver who (as per his words) likes to visit it with his family. It was full of guests, however friendly staff managed to find a nice place for us and even changed for another table with better view in a couple of minutes. We have taken black pepper and chili crabs and both of them where great. Also the shark fin soup was super delicious. Great place for reasonable price
2
We had to ask for a bib even though we ordered their famous crab we ordered a bottle of white wine and had to ask for an ice bucket and even though I had emailed them and told them we were celebrating a birthday they didn't acknowledge this we were also told we had to finish by 9:30pm with our booking at 8:15 this gave us 75mins but our dinner didn't arrive till after 9 which definitely made us rush to finish overall not a pleasant experienc
5
We have been here twice whilst on stopover in Singapore. Pauline Lee looked after us superbly. The Chilli Crab is not to be missed (don't forget to get a bib!!) and the Gung Bao Prawns deliciously spicy. Helped down with a jug of beer this place should not be missed. It is very large but run with the efficiency of a well oiled engine. Booking is helpful but, we found, not essential. Give it a try if you love seafood
5
i know that Jumbo is a chain restaurant, but the Jumbo on east coast road is great. the food and the service is great. the outside dining (although a bit warm) is really good. i would go back again. i havent tried the other Jumbo's along the riverwalk, but they appear to be doing a great business, so i would assume that they are fairly comparable in quality to what i found at the east coast road location
3
Restaurant is famous due to Gordon Ramsey competition in chilli crab which they lose anyway. Chilli crab is Singapur traditional most famous dish. Of course it was tasty. But in general place was very crowdy so it is better to make a reservation in advance. It is rather like restaurant fast food but with very tasy dishes. Generally nice experience
2
This is a reasonable priced but the derive is terrible. We were given a table with1 hour 15 time slot. We realised what we ordered was not what was on the receipt. So informed the waiter who promptly re-ordered, which didn't turn mains didn't turn up until we finished!! When it came to the bill they still wanted to charge for it. The manager then agreed to remove the item but it too 15 minutes settle the bill. This us what happens when you let places put a standard service charge, without the derive to show for it!!
5
Best chilli crab I have had for years. Will go there again if I am in Singapore. Better to book in advance if you can.
4
Shuts early. Ambience ok. But seafood great. Expensive for the grade but it's almost obligatory to ones senses to feat at jumbo at least once during your stay in Singapore.
1
The staff was very unkind.
food is dilicious. but food value is so terrible..
I will not recommend jumborestaurant.
4
I ate chilli crab there. taste was excellent but too many people were inside. no tissues in the restroom, had only 1 hour to eat so we were in a hurry cracking crab. anyway, it was dellicious.
3
This place is very touristy. This is not necessarily a bad thing but if I came to Singapore again, I would go somewhere else especially to get the chili crab. The worst part about this restaurant is the peanut scam that many people describe. They will put peanuts on your table and later charge you for them which is ridiculous. We didn't eat the peanuts knowing this and they still charged us. However, we told them and they took it off of our bill. The peanuts are only over a dollar, it just is more of the principle that they try and trick you. The food itself is good but for the most part it is over priced and you can get it cheaper nearby since there are many other places to eat
5
Went to try Chili Crab here with family and was not disappointed. We ordered the crab, a pepper crab, rice buns (to soak up the sauce), prawns coated in corn flakes, and tofu topped with spinach. Glad I wore shorts and could unbutton the top button. Gluttony galore.The staff was great in its recommendations and had no problems getting a reservations.The restaurant is located in old British army barracks which were once used by the Japanese as "interment camps". Now it is a site for multiple trendy restaurants. Did not see any ghosts or spirits
5
If you're a seafood lover go here and just get one chilli crab as your meal and nothing else. I was full off just the crab meat, I couldn't even finish the last claw. I'll never stop thinking about this dish I had here, perfection! We didnt book when we came but they did tell us to come back in 1 hour to have a seat. If you can book, book & if you dont, dont be surprised if they send you away
4
Very busy place and very popular. No flash setting here paper table cloths paper bids for patrons. Great atmosphere. Very fast service with quick turnover of tables. Food is fantastic. Cannot beat their fresh mud Crabs. I Know Messy. But well worth it. A Singapore must.Grea
5
Really glad i went here (twice). Singapore chilli crab is an institution, and a must do. Not very spicy but delicious. Steamed buns were heaven! Look - you aren't going to get the best service here - because they are so used to serving huge crowds - but you have to come. the venue is great - and there are 2 branches close to each other. You HAVE to book online - its virtually impossible to get a table by just showing up and if you do, you have to be out in 45 minutes. We got lucky once, but booked the other time.
2
There are two Jumbo. You only know which one was your reserved when you arrived. I came to the right one in 30 mins before. But they gave the table to all walk in customers in first before your reserved time. Then finally I was arranged with table for two person but we were three persons
2
I am not satisfied with the customer service.
I am not good at English.
I think your female employee is frustrated.
she shot back angrily.
I will don't go again.
1
We met very very rude and impolite women at the reception of the restaurant.
I will never visit there again.
I should have known that there are better restaurants where I can enjoy much delicious chili crabs, which are more preferable between local Singapore people.
3
The service was so so though the food was good.
Breaktime had coming and a crew asked to move out while not finished my dish.
Breaktime is important and I admit that, but felt almost kicked out of the restaurant.
4
Had a great dinner here with big group after a day of work. Restaurant was very crowded and making a reservation is advised. Had chili and pepper crab, is was excellent. Other side dishes also more than tasty. If you are a seafood lover this place can't be skipped
5
A perfect place for dinner under the stars near the water and the food is great too. Sure you need to play the game of refusing the free (they are not) peanuts. But the napkins are complimentary.Weve eaten chili and pepper crabs. Various rice dishes and salt egg prawns all were superb. Abalone wasnt great but there is plenty more good stuff to have.We often fly in, head here and then taxi to the hotel after weve had dinner. A great start to our visits
3
It seems that even if you make reservations, you are given only 1.5 hrs to finish your meal. We arrived 15 mins early, and was told we should prepare to leave 15 mins earlier than what our reservation promised us. The online booking system is a bit problematic too - I wanted to book at 730pm for 4 people, but when I chose 4 people, tables were only available at 1pm. I had to book a table for 6 people to get a 730pm timeslot. I found the receptionist from China a little cold. The servers were friendlier and warmer. They helped distribute the bibs and covered our bags to protect them from flying sauces.The restaurant area is half air-conditioned, half-outdoor and tables crammed close together.Ordered two black pepper crabs (about 1.5kg, it's $68/kg), half a roasted chicken ($20+), broccoli with scallops ($20+) and a fried rice with chicken and salted fish ($20+). The dishes were ok - the scallops tasted fresh. The crab tasted ok too but seemed a bit overcooked. The flesh was flaky and stuck to the shell. We had planned for my sister to blow out candles on her birthday cake, but by the time we finished our food, our time was up. They didn't shoo us away, but we felt conscious about the time they had told us. So we just packed up the cake, paid the bill and left.The bill came up to almost $200 dollars for 4 people
4
The food was great, the service was great, and you can't really complain about the location with a view of the water. It is extremely busy however and difficult to get a taxi from. There's a bus but often quite a wait and then there's a few people with private cars taking advantage of the situation. I was in a group hosted by a local who did the ordering for us which probably made the most of the situation in terms of the food we had, which was excellent. All in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile experience that i'd recommend and repeat
5
A little bit spicy, a little bit sweet, and a whole lot of delicious, is how Singapore's most loved dish can be described. Despite the embarrassment that may follow from the messy and lack of dining etiquette that comes along with sampling a Singaporean favourite, you will end your meal licking your fingers clean, as many of the other diners will be doing too. Jumbo Seafood as a Singaporean Institution so famous for its Singaporean Chilli Crab that even a booking comes with a half hour wait in line before being seated and at least a 45 minute wait for the crab to arrive at your table, but be assured, the wait is totally worth it.For more photos, please check out our travel blog:http://www.wanderlustchronicles.com.au/#!Jumbo-Seafood-Singapore/c1ljw/

we read that this place was the best place to buy chilli crab and took there for an evening meal.we were seated imediatley and then just as we picked up the menu we were asked if we'd prefer to sit inside as the waiter was concerned it was going to start raining soon. we moved inside and sure as he said,without any warning it started raining??? the kids had different meals ,my wife had a lobster soup type dish and i had the chilli crab,aparently the best in singapore.................was it???i have no idea but it was absolutley incredible. its right up there with the best meals ive had in a restaurant. i tried the small sour dough balls too and they made cleaning the plate effortless.i did notice that other diners had aprons and gloves.....something i could have done with as i was covered by the end of the meal. staff are more than happy to bring cold jugs of water whenever you need and just before yu get to the restrooms theres a long butler style sink to clean yourselves at. such a good idea. teh meal for four was around Â£70 which was about what id expect to pay for a meal of that standard . highly recomended and if we go back to singapore we will be going back there again
4
We have heard about this restaurant long time, first time trying it with relatives gathering. Food is average good, chilli crab is their special but I honestly do not feel it is excellent level. I do agree the white pepper crab we tried at other restaurants does taste better. It is a bit pricey but I guess we are at singapore seafood so cannot expect less. I personally do not see this much better than other seafood restaurants
4
black paper crap is very very good but so hot.
chilly crap is very good.
i can speak English a little.
so, i explain it shortly.
thanks jumbo seafood.
3
Been there a few times and always come away disappointed. Always on the expensive side and you feel you are in a sausage factory. There are better restaurants on Clarke Quay
4
Restaurant with outside seating in a great part of town. The food here is great but make sure you wear a bib to avoid disaster! Service is fast and efficient. Chilli crab is a must!
4
We walked-in and was offered a table for 1 hour and 15 minutes. We ordered chili crab, oatmeal prawn, seafood fried rice and fried vegetable. The crab itself was good, but we consider the white pepper crab we tried at No Signboard last time better. Also the crab here was more expensive. The prawn was wonderful - tasty and juicy. The fried rice and the vegetable were good. The waiters were very busy so it took us quite some time to wait for them to take our order, so left us shorter time to finish the dinner with crab.
4
Wanted to checkout the popular chilli crab here with my sister. Made an online reservation with no problems. Turning up for lunch on the day where the staff who greeted us and showed us our table were a little blunt and rude giving us some attitude. One of the waitresses who later served us however had a warmer and friendlier personality. We had chilli crab (1 crab), sugar cane prawns, 2 mini bread buns, 2 drinks for a light lunch - approximately ($85).Good as an overall food experience but would check out other places for the same kind of meal. Service is definitely something to improve on

I have been to Jumbo twice, once in November 2013 and once in July 2014. Both times it was good food, the service was so-so. I got the chili crab both times, which is what they are most known for. It is good, not too spicy, but they only give you a few of the buns (mantou I think they are called) and the buns are very small. You have to ask for a bib (which is really required) and for implements to crack the crab

Location good, at the east coast sea front. Ambience just ok. Service, although efficient, reminds more of a fast food restaurant-it is a big place. Food taste just ok, nothing exciting. Charging SIN$ 72,- for a steamed 800g Garoupa fish for me is rip off. I can not recommend.

About 8 years ago my husband and I had chilli crab at Jumbo Seafood and it has been a dream of mine to go back to Singapore to have the meal again. However this time I was dreadfully disappointed!! We ordered the meal, a small fried rice and broccoli in garlic butter (they'd run out of spinach and didn't off bok choy!) and of course chilli crab for two. They immediately put peanuts and Chinese tea on our table without us asking for it and we had to pay for it. the huge steaming dish of chilli crab was to say the least disappointing, as the crab itself was so small it wouldn't have been enough to feed a ten year old...! The dish was of course filled with the delicious chilli sauce but it certainly needed more (r bigger) crab in it. there was only one tiny weeny little crab in the dish for two of us!!!! My husband also had 1 beer and I had a coke! the bill.......wait for it.....was $116-00!!!!!! Outrageous in my opinion. Today in our local Perth paper, blue mana crabs were $12-95 a kilo!!! We wouldn't have had a 1/4 of a kilo in our dish! Won't be going back to Jumbo Seafood every again. I sat next to a Singaporean gentleman on the plane back home and he said they have prices for the locals and a different price for the tourists!!! Lookout google I need to know how to cook chilli crab, Singapore style!!

I visited here by myself for summer vacation. It's little much to eat by alone... but the food was really good!!! It's niceIf i have chance to go singapore again, I will go this restuarant!!!compare to riverside jumbo restuarant, this restuarant is aloso nice and good

Chilli crab has overtaken as the most well known dish in the singapore cuisine among travelers. Thus...Searching for my favorite chilli crab has become my pastime whenever I am back in town. Today I went to jumbo seafood at east coast park with a company of 8 people to taste some of the popular dishes. The service level is far better than most of the other jumbo seafood restaurants. They paid attention to your requests which makes the dining experience very pleasant. We ordered their signature dishes ... Chilli crab and pepper crab. Most dishes are generally more spicy than usual. While I like it spicy, some people may it the spicy taste overwhelming. The pepper crab tastes better since it is easy to associate with the direct black pepper flavor and allows you to enjoy the crab's freshness easily.The chilli crab tastes like more complicated. With abundant sauce on the crab, there is a tendency that you will focus on the taste of sauce than the crab, thus missing out on the overall experience. Based on the ingredients, you are expected to have a taste of chills spice, tomato and eggs. But the tomato sauce and the eggy flavor are concealed by the spicy and salty taste. But it creates a pleasant thickened and sticky sauce that is very unique. The chilli crab from Jumbo East Park is still among the top offerings from their chain of restaurants. Some other dishes which we ordered... Fried baby squid, doughstick stuff with cuttlefish paste, the fried noddle called 'mee goreng' and kailan. There is nothing to shout about these dishes in generally. The good service deserves mention and I would encourage that one should travel to east coast park to eat and enjoy the ambience of seaside.

Just Amazing, Chilli Crab is so good
Get some steamed bun's, perfect match
Been here many times, and its always great

This restaurant was recommended by friends who live in Singapore. We thought that it if the locals like it, it must be good. True enough, food was delicious! They have the best cereal prawns and Chili Crab! Prices are steep! But it is worth it.
4
Went to eat with my girlfriend. The food was generally fantastic and the waiting time for the food wasn't long either. However, we were quite shcoked when we realised we have to finish eating by a certain timing. We went at 6pm and had to finish by 7.15pm. Thought we had no time limit as other places we went didn't have this. Closer to the time the staff will give us the bill I advance to give us a kind reminder but we sort of overshot the time and one of the staff seemed to me looking at us as if to hurry us. This isn't very good as it sort of stresses us to finish faster and unable to enjoy the food as much. Though in the end we overshot the time and the staff didn't really "chase" us, I still hope the management takes this into consideration.

Hm, yes it can be overrated, touristy experience, but I feel anyone who comes to Singapore must try Singaporean Chili Crab at least once. And this is a good place to try it.While the resto serves other types of crab dish, I recommend trying their signature chili crab. It is cooked in orange-reddish sauce that is sweet, sour and spicy (but not too spicy!). You'd get a serving of mantou (fried bun) on the side to wipe off that delicious sauce on your plate.We ordered the crab dish as a part of a set menu. The other dish were very good too, but at the end we felt it was a bit much as the portions were generous.Service was prompt, attentive and helpful. No complaint there
4
Having visited the Riverside restaurant with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the drunken prawns and chilli crab I chose to visit the Clarke Quay restaurant at lunch on my own. I opted for the prawns again and they were lovely. I was not at all rushed and the service was great. I would say that I preferred the atmosphere at the Riverside restaurant but possibly advise people to visit at lunchtime as I didn't experience any of the conveyor belt experience mentioned by others
5
Two friends took me to Jumbo while I was visiting Singapore and insisted I try their famous Chilli Crab. I was not disappointed. The crab was delicious. We also had some of their drunken prawns which again I could not fault. The restaurant was very busy but the staff were friendly and attentive at all times. The atmosphere was great and I enjoyed the experience so much I visited the Clarke Quay branch the next day.
1
After reading reviews, we are a little confused as to what all the hype was about.Went there on a Sat night (2 adults, (2 tennagers) and coudnt get out of there quick enough.Chilli crab sauce tasted like it was thickened with cornflower and poured over boiled crab (not wok tossed)Prawns with cheese sauce oily and tasteless, scallops in dish with sauce nothing like the pic on menu and 1 or 2 other dishes we all shared were nothing we expected.Bill came to $235 for the 4 of us and felt lucky to escape with this as we would have been happy to pay twice that for quality.Can only be described as a seafood mcdonalds, but dearer

When visiting Singapore you must try their most famous national dish - chilli crab. For people who don't like chilli do not be put off by the name - the sauce is sweeter than it is spicy. What I love is the deep fried buns (mantou) that are served with this tasty dish.In Singapore the locals are evenly split between chilli crab lovers and black pepper crab lovers. Personally I love them both but chilli crab wins the race by a pincer purely because it's served with a lot of sauce and you can request extra mantou to soak it up with - whereas the black pepper crab sauce is only cooked onto the shell of the crabs.The mud crabs are large so I recommend sharing 1 between at least 2 people - however the larger the crowd the more meals you can share. This is not just a crab/seafood restaurant - they also serve Chinese meals which are best shared with rice (tze char).When in Singapore you must try both crabs to determine your favourite before a local asks you which side of the fence you sit on! Also enjoy a great tze char experience with family and/or friends

We were told this was a must do in Singapore. Missed our allotted booking as we arrived late into Singapore but persevered and accepted a share table, no problem. Ordered the chilli crab and it came out in no time, they must have a production line of these things. Everyone was having it.We were hopeless at eating it ! Only order this dish if you know how to eat your way around a crab. For the cost it wasnt worth it for us as we left hungry, would like to try again with people who know their crabs. The taxi driver told us this is a tourist restaurant and there are much more authentic places to eat chilli crab
4
On my last day in Singapore my colleagues took me to lunch at Jumbo at Clarke Quay to have chilli crab and pepper crab. Being a girl from Baltimore, I know crab and Jumbo served good crab. I admit that I was skeptical about my crab swimming in a chilli sauce, but it was delish! Scoop the sauce up with steamed dumplings and you're in heaven! In my book, the pepper crab enjoyed a slight edge over the chilli crab because it was similar to Baltimore style steamed crab
4
Stopped here on our last night in country to get our last fix of chili crab. Was impressed we the number of people eating here while the neighboring restaurants were empty.
5
Chili crab was fantastic. The location is energetic - full of music and life. Try sat us at a round table with 3 other groups because the tables are quite large but our conversation was still private and we had a great view of their "aquarium" where they stick their fresh seafood. Service was quick, and English speaking. Bibs were provided to protect clothing from messy crab. Easily accessible by city hall metro stop - only a 5 minute walk. Gorgeous river view from outside seating area. Prices were reasonable for the area - our market price chili crab was around S$60. It was a great place for a casual date with my husband. Fun atomosphere, comfortable chairs, masochistic white table clothes for all of the red chili crabs they serve that splatter everywhere. Lots of veg and healthy options on the menu for vegetarians and health nuts. They also had a hand washing station outside of the restrooms so it was easy to wash up after the meal without waiting in line for the bathrooms
3
So everyone tells you the best chili crab in Singapore is at Jumbo. If the lines and turnover of customers is any indication. .. it's true. We had one chili crab (1.2kg) and one black pepper crab (1kg) - frankly I couldn't see the difference in the size. The chili crab comes with more of a spicy sauce with bits of crab in it (it is not as spicy as some indicate) and the pepper come with very little sauce but with very large bits of black pepper. We also had an order of broccoli (plain) and six Corona beers. The tab came to 250sgd (about $200usd).I liked the broccoli, the crabs, the white tablecloths, and the air con.I disliked the sense of being rushed. They make a big point of giving you a big card with a time on it and telling you before sitting down "you must be finished at xyz time" which for us was 1 hr 15 minutes. Then..... 10 minutes before our "deadline", someone came by and pulled out the big card to make sure we noted the amount of time left. Recommendations:1. Study the menu before you sit down so that you can order immediately. .. otherwise you are using your previous time allocation unwisely2. Make a reservation and specify inside if you want air con. 3. They give you a wet napkin..... ask for more. . You will need it. 4. Get your tissues out before you get your hands dirty. .... with the spicy food, you are likely to need them! 5. Ask for more sets of tools.6. Enjoy

We ordered a chilli crab and waited 45 minutes. The tables around us who were seated 15-20 minutes after us got their crabs within 10 minutes. Then the staff had the nerve to tell us to hurry up and finish.This is a restaurant that gives you only 1hr and 15 minutes to finish your meal and leave the table.A very disappointing experience as we took international guests here for the first chilli crab
4
I do not regard myself as a crab person, not having enjoyed crab meals in the past. But then I was recommended Jumbo by friends from far and wide ( for the record, India, Singapore and the US).So I decided to visit Jumbo during my last trip to Singapore. The whole experience was very good. The location could not be more attractive, with the possibility of a walk along the beach (sea actually) before the meal. Appetizing sight of a lot of people merrily enjoying their meals as you walked in. It was a weekday and thus getting a table was not too difficult even though we did not have a reservation. The menu was quite comprehensive with a lot of variety to justify the image of this Seafood joint. The food itself was very tasteful and light to digest. The service was excellent with the waiting staff able to offer answers to all your questions. The service was quick and courteous too.We had chilly crab and I am sure that this dish is quite a rage with the gourmet loving people visiting this place. As far as I am concerned, it only confirmed my apprehension that I am not a crab person. Its not that the taste is not good, but I feel that for me the amount of effort involved is not justified by the taste. So best of luck to all the crab lovers. The place is very nice, even though it is a bit on the expensive side. I would love to go there again for all the reasons listed above and may be try prawns the next time. ;

i loved the chili crab and i suggest , eat them with sweet mantou . i don't like spicy food but when i eat with mantou was very delicious .and what i like more.....free wifi , plastic for your handphone so you can operate even your hands are dirtytips : come early because it's very crowded restauran
4
We booked the riverside point restaurant about 3 months in advance as they get extremely busy. So busy that they leave a note on your table saying someone else has your table in 1 1/4 hrs. It is definentley not a sit back enjoy the food and view. It's a sit, eat and go. But having said that we picked this restaurant to try our 1st Singapore chilli crab ever. It was absolutely delicious. A real finger licking good meal. It's not cheap but very much worth it
4
The sauce for the chilli crab at Jumbo restaurants is not over-spicy & has a background flavour of candle nuts or peanuts. Servings are generous & the accompanying sweet buns & rice make the need for other courses less pressing. You will have the choice of a number of locations
5
It was the first time I ate chili crab and I was in short time covered with food. But yeah..delicious food, I must admit. Everything we ordered was really good. But the restaurant was very very very busy so we had to wait for a table. And for us was the first evening in the hot wet air of Singapore, difficult to breath. So we were sweating like hell and hoping we will be the lucky one who get a table inside, under the cool breeze of an airco.. Instead we get a table outside, at the entrance. On the other hand, I must admit when we started to eat and to drink (and the waiter take care that your cup is full with hot tea) I didn't have so much problems anymore with the heat
4
We ate at the Riverside Jumbos on Clarke Quay and I advise making a booking because it is very popular. We could only get a 9:15pm reservation and booked 2 days in advance. It is a fun experience wearing the bibs, getting stuck into the crab and being very messy. The crab itself was delicious but if this is not your thing they have a great selection of seafood, etc
5
Enjoyed both the jumbo crabs -chilli & black pepper. Mocha ribs a MUST try! Good food and service. No complains.
Overall, it was a good dining experience.
5
Chili crab and the mee goreng was so delicious! The river side location has the best atmosphere and the food is one of a kind. Be sure to make reservations as the wait can be long.
2
Went as a group and really dissapointed from what we were expecting. Overated and expensive for what was served.
4
Everybody knows that their Chili crab is so tasty. Jumbo Seafood outlet in East Coast Seafood Centre is a special one. What can beat the experience eating a tasty seafood by the beach, right?
5
Excellent Lobster wrapped sugarcane.....Crab with buns was the signature dish but do have their spinach with garlic.....tasty!!! Expensive but worth it. We also had the seafood Mee Goreng which was good.
2
Visited the first night in Singapore ... And it was the worst meal that we had in the next six days. Whole fish was way overlooked and they must have taken the meat off before serving it as there was very little left on the fish. Vegetables were swimming in some sort of sauce and tasteless. Prawns had only the taste of the oil they were cooked in.Indifferent service. Would not recommend
4
I had been waiting all week to get my hands on a chili crab, and it was well worth the wait. We split some smaller dishes first, really nice long clams in a garlic sauce - so tasty! Some vegetables, then the main dish our huge chili crab came out! We ordered some bread with it, which was key for soaking up that delicious sauce. The crab was cooked perfectly, nice large pieces of meat and tons of sauce. It is pricier than most of the other food I ate all week, but I think well worth it! I'll definitely be back
5
We have been to Jumbo's East Coast a few times this was our first time at the Riverwalk restaurant. Unfortunately we didn't make a reservation, however because we were early they gave us a table. The seafood fried rice is the best I have ever had with nice big succulent prawns, the cereal prawns were huge, juicy and very tasty. We also had the pepper crab which was nice but highly recommend if you have never had Singapore chilly crab then this is a must. Messy to eat but very good. The seafood meals here are of high quality, the service is very organised but expensive but of course for quality you always pay more. Food experience at Jumbo's is always a highlight
4
Frankly speaking, too much positive reviews of this restaurant that I had tried twice during my two visits. One is Jumbo Riverwalk, one is in the East Coast. The atmosphere of East Coast is much better in terms of the environment for it is at the seashore with breeze at night. However, the price was very high regarding the quality of crab. Try once but no more. Why I tried the second time simply because I did not try the crab for the first time. If you really want to try only once, go to the east coast. For there is also one famous restaurant, Long Beach. If you have no time to wait, then there at least several seafood restaurants there
5
We chose food by looking at what our neighbours were ordering so we chose lobster wrapped on sugarcane, Vietnamese style, which was great. Their signature dish was Singapore chilly crab, again really good. Sitting in Clark quay eating great seafood was a lovely way to spend one evenin
4
If you're in Singapore, you HAVE to try the infamous chilli crabs (brother pepper crab is also very tasty). This is place knows how to do them well. Unfortunately it's pretty expensive. And ambience isn't the best.
4
We wish we ate here every night of our Singapore trip. Chilli mud crab is fantastic; the best we've had anywhere. Highly recommend, but if you don't want to pay for the peanuts, don't touch them!
4
The meal was superb although $81 for a chilli crab meal may be a little expensive. It is throughly worth it.
4
We came there at 6pm but it was very crowded. Of course the chili crab was the dish I wish to try. Everything's great and amazing. We will back to Jumbo in near future.
4
The food there is variety and amazing.Too bad it was too crowded until some staffs ignored my request and left me thirsty so long before I got my Tea refilled.
3
We have lived in Singapore on and off for over 3 years and never tried Jumbo. Decided to give it a try tonight. We had salted egg prawns, scallops and vegetables, and a pacific grouper (small). Our son had chicken satay. No alcohol. Bill was S$190. In my opinion, the food was good, but I have had better at the Newton Hawker Center. This location of Jumbo has a really nice view of the water, of course, in Singapore means you watch the freighters and oil tankers, but still is nice to be near the water. I do not regret going here, but would not do it again. I suggest trying the other places in this plaza, though I have not personally tried any of them - maybe the same $$$, not sure. If it is just great food you want, try the hawker center
3
This is a restaurant famous for its crabs and seafood. It is beautifully located at the East Coast Seafood Centre. This and other restaurants in the area are open air and fabulous. Unfortunately (for the price) the famous chilli crab was really only ok. Not great. Next time I will try some of the other less crowded restaurants in the complex. Maybe (like Avis of old) they try harder.
3
You'd think if you spent S$170 on a meal for two with a couple of beers each the service would be better. We loved the food, but a smile when being greeted goes a long way. If you go for the chili crab the gravy ends up all over you, and your defense is one napkin. For some reason I didn't want to trouble the staff for another one so I went for a cleanup mid meal. The staff also started to clean up for the evening while we were still eating, a pet hat of mine. If you go here. get one crab and more fillers (little buns and rice) or look for a restaurant that will offer a personal touch.
4
I got the pleasure of dining here as part of a larger group for work, whilst I was hoping to be able to sit outside, due to the size of our group we were seated upstairs. We managed to get through a hugely wide selection of dishes, beautiful abalone, garlic greens, freshly steamed prawns, and of course the highlight being the chilli crab. The chilli crab is juicy, messy, and purely delightful. Plenty of juicy gravy to be mopped up with the sweet bread buns. The boys were kept happy with the continuous supply of beer, and the fresh coconuts had to be some of the best I've ever had. The only very small gripe I had would be the lack of english spoken by our serving staff. A couple of times we weren't sure of what the dishes were, and trying to get that from the staff proved challenging....it didn't stop us from eating the tasty goodness, we just wanted to know what it was
5
Sitting outside along the water front, watching people pass and hundreds of ships which light up like a shore, eating wonderful food and getting very messy in the process. What more could one want?! The chili crab is to die for, and the black pepper crab is close behind. Best place for food + atmosphere - book first
4
Nevertheless, the crab was delicious. We ordered the chili crab and black pepper crab, with the black pepper crab more tasty. After the bill, we wished we visited the less commercial/touristy crab restaurants nearby though.
5
Wow. after long time had excellent pepper crab.We three have gone there for late dinner, and it was good.. also the prawns were good. There was another carb dish,,with lots of curry..yummy..even the mutton chop was good..never expected that. staff excellent..location excellent..seating very good..
4
a typical thing to eat in singapore, but gotta have a thing for spicy food! The crab size is good for two! be ready to dive in with your ten fingers and expect a mess :)
3
Tasty food and was a very enjoyable lunch. The problem is the bill! I know Singapore is probably the most expensive city in the world but for what we were served it was ridiculous. Just be prepared to take some extra money with you when you go as you may get a shock. Unfortunately that seems to be the norm in Singapore
5
My friends and I visited this restaurant because of a recommendation of another friend. It was about 9pm on Thursday but it was still a full house! We ordered the dinner set for 4 -- soup, lobster, signature black pepper crab, fried noodle and dessert! Actually I wasn't a fans of seafood and I found the crab too spicy for me. But my friends were crab fanatics. They all have fallen in love with the pepper crab!! They says it was superb!! They even bought the black pepper sauce so that they could cook so at home!!Some tips:- Remember to make an appointment and get the indoor table! - To try more different dishes, grab more friends to go together
4
I bring customers for dinner frequently. Compared to the jumbo at riverwalk, the main branch at east coast is better. The space is generous and the chilli crabs are delicious. Though the gravy seemed low in portion. The beer price is high, but I don't really care. Overall, a good experience for my foreign customers
4
We had to go to Jumbos for Chilli Crab we were told and one day we found ourselves at Clarke Quay and spotted it. So in we went and ordered the crab. We were taken aback at the size of the dishes presented but should have been aware we in for a treat when they placed bib napkins around our necks. It was a messy but very enjoyable meal, certainly not cheap but great. If you are allergic to MSG be aware that it abounds aplenty in this dish as it does in quite a few places in Singapore
4
Had the experience of Pepper Crab at Jumbo and it was delicious. Great location right on the water and just didn't disappoint. Like a bit more authentic local flair when I go to places like Singapore - which is why it didn't get the 5th star...but a good choice
5
The best chilli crab i've had! Definitely need to book beforehand as they are extremely busy. They give you a time slot, about 45mins. The food comes out pretty quick though so you have time...to eat. The service is pretty much a get in get out kind of deal. Which is fine... we just wanted to eat and get out. I do recommend you get the mini fried bread rolls with the chilli crab to soak up all the delicious flavours in the bowl. Definitely a go-to restaurant anytime i am in Singapore.
5
I was invited by my business colleagues for a dinner to try the most famous local delight: "chilli crab". Besides that the fodd there is simply amazing, I need to say that the place itself and service are great as well. Seeting just at the sea, trying amazing food, and having nice chat - what more you need
4
I was not familiar with all the sea food dishes they were proposing. For me, it was more like a culinary adventure, which ended up really good!
The high-light of that evening: the pepper crab!
4
Pepper crab was fantastic, very busy crowdy restaurant, but very nice experience overall. Riverside is a plus; restaurant is big. Just perfect
5
Have your black pepper crabs here instead of boat quay or clark quay which I think is highly overrated & overpriced
4
Something about eating spicy and messy chili crab while gazing at huge container ships on the South China Sea is cathartic. Service is slow, slow, slow especially when the restaurant is cranking. But because the food is so delicious and the views and people watching so cool, you forget about the snail like pace of the services and kitchen staff. Show up before 6pm if you want faster service and less crowds. Jumbo Seafood not only had to die for chili crab, but the black pepper crab is also great and the Seafood Fried Rice with Jumbo's homemade sweet chili sauce was fantastic. We waffle between Long Island Main and Jumbo East Coast for chili crab but taste for taste and dollar for dollar go for Jumbo East Coast. The people watching along the water is a bonus
5
Was taken here while on a business trip to Singapore. We had set menu that would have fed an army, dish after dish after dish came, with some fish I have never seen before. However I tried it all and each dish was superb, even the sea urchin.However the best dish was the black pepper crab. The crab is huge with so much meat, it is one of the most delicious dishes I have had.If in Singapore try this place, it is great
4
To get a table had to be seated by 5.30 and out by 6.45! Still we were served very quickly and efficiently and it was plenty of time as not really the sort of restaurant to linger in. The chilli crab was what we went for and it was delicious, if messy, so the bibs provided were essential! A Singapore experience
3
I like seafood, so this was an easy one to convince me to try. We took the first opportunity for a meal in Singapore to try out this "local delight". I found the Chili Crab a good blend of flavors and spices and not too "hot", but the Pepper Crab suited me much better with the higher level of "kick" from all that black pepper. We tried a few other items that add to my list of new items to try in foreign countries, including jellyfish at Jumbo Seafood. I mention that this is a tourist thing to doas well, which pretty much sums up the rest of my feeelings about the place. It was a great experience and a lot of fun with colleagues
5
Hugely popular, I had to wait for about 15 mins to get a table at sundown. Well worth the wait. The staff are good and really did look after us, even though they were very busy. I was in no rush. They brought our bibs along and our huge chilli crab. More than enough crab for two people. The only thing I would have liked would be a bigger bowl of lemon water to wash hands after eating the chilli crab. I will definitely return here
4
As good as always we have a simple dinner gathering on Father Day, The location here at the beach front always pack and crowded on Sat & Sun to avoid disappointment reserved is a must.Restaurant serves good pepper crabs, chilli crabs and drunken prawns and all other sea foods and dishes. After a hearty meal is good to stroll along the beach area. One thing that bother me and is annoying the sitting area some how to near to one another a bit cramp, one party need to get up from your seat in order to allowed wheelchair or baby stroller to passed through
4
We came here for my father's birthday and really enjoyed ourselves. The location right on the sea front is just perfect as you get a healthy sea breeze and get to quit fretting about the heat and humidity for a bit.Our meal was delicious and all the dishes were very well prepared. We had crab with salt egg yolk sauce which lent an interesting savoury, powdery dimension to the sweet and firm crabmeat. The prawns were large, firm flesh and very fresh. Would definitely visit again
5
Very famous in Singapore. Don't miss the black chilli crab and much more. It's good to order from the 'Set Menu'.
5
The dishes at this restaurant were delicious. Their specialty dish chilli crab was superb - just be prepared for the mess!
5
This restaurant is really hard to get to by public transportation. Its inside the nature park and there is a long way to the nearest bus station.
However the food is fantastic. Will come back here again for the crab.
4
Its all about the chilli crabs for me in Singapore and Jumbo makes them amazing! Very fresh seafood, great service, good prices. I highly reccommend.
5
Great experience of eating the cillicrabs...we went there because the Jumbo restaurant on Clarke quay had a large queue and needed 45 minutes waiting...the food was great...service was really good and my bro really liked the sour sop juice as well
4
I was at the Jumbo Restaurant for an office dinner. The food spread and quality was amazing. we have had all varieties of food - fish, crab, abalone, prawns, veggies, chicken, mushrooms etc, and everything was perfect and awesome. really got stuffed with the food. The service was very good. really enjoyed the evening and would love to return soon. cheer
5
Heard from Singapore friends that this is one of the higher priced seafood restaurants. But for novices like me, i feel that at least the. Freshness of the seafood is guaranteed, so it's well worth the price. Try the chili crabs and the steamed fish. Simple dishes, done to perfection
5
When you are in Singapore, your trip is not complete without eating Chilli crab. There are so many places where you can find Chilli crabs, but the best dishes to suit your pallette are found in East coast area. We went to Jumbo East Coast Parkway with another couple who live in Singapore. They have lived here for many years and they agreed our selection of Jumbo East Coast was the best for Chilli crabs. The place was full and we asked for a table on the upper floor which is airconditioned. On hot days, even the night air is hot and humid. We felt very comfortable sitting in the airconditioned area. The downside was that we did not have a good view of the sea. It was fine with us, because we were going to do a walk along the beach after dinner and then take a taxi back to the hotel. We were initially planning to order Chilli Crabs, but at the last minute we decided to go for Pepper crabs for a change. We have tried Chilli Crabs on many previous occasions, but not Pepper crabs. Chilli crabs come with gravy and soft buns to accompany them. Pepper crabs are prepared somewhat dry and we ordered a few other dishes to go with them. One was a full group fish prepared in Hong Kong style. The food was quite tasty, but very different from Chilli crabs. Any way it was a good experience and also a good chance to catch up with our old friends. Nowadays, you can find Chilli and Pepper crabs in most food centres and restaurants in Singapore. If you want to taste authentic Chilli crabs in a great atmosphere, you need to go to one of the seafood restaurants in the East Coast. Jumbo restaurant is very popular among tourists. One issue is that it can be difficult to get a cab for your return trip if you wait till very late in the night

From the moment I planned my trip to Singapore, everyone told me that I must visit Jumbo seafood and try the pepper crab. I did the exact same thing and I was not disappointed at all.We visited the Jumbo in east coast park on a weekday for dinner, there was plenty of space and we got a table easily, the staff was polite and helpful. The crab was well cooked and the tasted of the pepper sauce was well blended with the crab meat. I would recommend the pepper crab as compared to the chilly crab because the chilly crab isn’t that spicy as you would think. The chicken fried rice was well cooked and We were 5 of us who visited Jumbo. Ordered the Pepper crab, fried rice, some chicken starter (didn’t care much about it as the crab got all my attention ), and a few beers and the bill was around 170 SGD. For a good meal the price seemed reasonable as per Singapore standards

We went there in the evening for dinner, according to internet and friends suggestion its really good to try and experience this restaurant, the ambience is really alive specially in the evening, the lights and bars and the people everywhere. When we arrived there around 8pm we didnt realize we didnt booked for a table. So we wait and luckily there is a table only for two, of course we order the famous chili crab! And some bun to par with it. The service is ok, they help us take photo and well since theres a lot customer theres a bit of delay. But all in all food is great.
5
We tried to get into this restaurant one night without a booking and it was impossible. We went to another restaurant that night but came back the next day for lunch. WOW, definitely worth booking and making the trek there.The chili crab traditional there, but if you also try black pepper and tomato based for non-chili eaters or kids. The tomato base is just as amazing and tastes just as amazing as it looks.The price of Jumbo seafood is relatively cheap compared of other 'well known' seafood restaurants - service was WAY better too

Me and my friends came there on the 14th may to take away fried rice and fried noodle, coz we were having bbq at the east coast, and we have run out of food.. As what written in the menu there is small,medium and large portion with different pricing. So we ask the stuff for large, how many pax can have it for? She told us it will be for 10pax. So we double confirm with she again, and yeah we are dumb enough to believe her and bought 2 packet of large fried noodle and fried rice that cost $53. After 15mins, she gave us a 2 small packet of container. It was so ridiculous!! 1 packet can only be eaten for 2pax!!!! We were really shock and speechless!! We were really ran out of time since our friends were waiting for us!! We were really not happy and satisfied!!

A restaurant which boasts about its big name in seafood. I did not have most of their dishes to comment on behalf everyone of them. But the one that i had was pretty average and overpriced for that. But more than that of the average food, its the ignorant service that i did not like
4
Eat outside and order the pepper crab. It's a beautiful location and you can eat cheap and good while you watch the cargo ships que up on the horizon.All in, one of the cheapest, but one of the most fun things to do in Singapore
4
One of the must-eat list for the tourist, outstanding dishes for both seafood and ordinary, cleanness and cozy ambiance been served in timing. You got to try the chill or pepper crab since its one of the significant dish in the town. Do no t miss out the chance. I will definitely come back or recommend this place to all my friends
3
The location stands out for me, although it was hot in Singapore. We were served with a quick and polite lady, who took our order quickly. I dont eat seafood, but i had company and they were looking forward to Crabs and prawns . I ordered some noodle which was huge in quantity but quiet tasty.The seafood lover would love this placeMust do in Singapor

There are several of these in Singapore. This is a must for those visiting. The chilly crab is a Singapore staple. The restaurant is always crowded and difficult to get in. You get a window of time you are permiited to stay - you essentially get an exit time. Funny. And effective. You pretty much have to get the chilly crab, but the rest of the menu is very good. I've been to Jumbos several times and tried other items in addition to the chilly crab and everything was very good.Service is fine. There are the fish tanks in the restaurant where you can choose your extra fresh fish - this is not uncommon over there but it's fascinating to those new to it. Every once in a while you see a big fish get scooped and 10 minuteds later it's being served. Highly recommend for anyone visiting Singapore. This has to be on the list of things to do
3
Tried chilli crab and mini bun at jumbo in Clark Q- Crab was very fresh but the sauce was too sweet for my taste buds. Service is average, the fact that we reached the place almost near the closing time may have made it worse. Cleaning staff started cleaning the place while we were having our meal and we were asked to pay for the food even before it was served as they wanted to close their accounts for the day. The serving staff were very helpful though in assisting us in choosing our meal. Won't go back for more but would recommend it for one time visit. For special occasions, VIP rooms may be booked for a private dinner
3
Supposedly the place for chilli crab, ate with some friends here and had a banquet. Food was okay but not memorable. Service was similar. Had to push very hard to use multiple credit cards to pay the bill for a large group dinner. There is a second outlet just 5 mins down the river and it's very easy to attend the wrong place (as we did) when booking or meeting friends. Thought the whole chilli crab was very overrated. Messy, not much meat and not much to share between 10 people.
4
My husband and I went for 10 days to Singapore and twice had dinner at the Jumbo Eastcoast parkway, they also call it the Seafood Food Court. Both times we had as appetizer the fried squids (yum) and as main we ate crab. First time I had the crab fried in butter with crwam milk sauce (amazing!!!) and my husband had their famous pepper crab (spicy but so tasty) and the second night we had the chilli crab and lobster braised in soup, both top! The crab and lobster are so fresh and tasty, pity we do not have a Jumbo in Holland. Btw, there are more Jumbo s in Singapore but this one is the first one opened more than 20 years ago and locals preffer it to the other ones that according to them are more expensive but I do not know if it is so as we did not go to the ones in the city. We paid for fried baby squid small portion, two fresh coconut juices and 2 small crabs 110 sing dollars, that is about 65 euros so I think it s a very, very good price. Service is fast but not everyone speaks English. At least they are nice and smile all the time. The resto is full every day of the week so if you do not want to wait for a table book in advance. Enjoy it as we surely did!
4
Of course, I don't miss the chili crab which is the most famous food in Singapore. Lucky me! I book the table online but I still have to wait a bit anyway. The waitress is nice and suggest us many foods.
4
Jumbo Seafood restaurant at Dempsey Road has a good range of seafood. We were there to try the famous Chilli Crab & we loved every bit of it. The price is a bit on the expensive side, but really worth it!
3
Quality of food is good. But with the cover charges, GST and Svc charge, the total food bill is not worth what one has to pay for. May other good eateries that provide similar for much less.
3
We came for the chili crab, a dish that I believe to be overrated. The sauce is too sweet and strong, overpowering the crab. Underneath that sauce, who can tell if they're eating crab or fish or chicken?So we tried the pepper crab, which was much better, though there are better versions in Singapore (Fatty Weng's comes to mind.) We also had the prawns in a sauce made by golden salted egg yolks, which was outstanding -- probably the best dish we had here.Service was brusque and the staff, while not actually rude, were clearly uninterested in actually providing service.You can do better in Singapore, in both food and experience
5
Everyone I know insisted that no trip to Singapore was complete without trying the chili crabI went to Jumbo having read the Tripadvisor reviewsI only just made it as they stop taking orders at 2 p.m.I was confronted with a big earthenware pot with crab shell and legs in a bright orangey/ red sauceArmed with a bib and the various implements I tucked into this delicious concoctionIt is really worth having the fried rolls to mop up the sauce and lots of cold Tiger beer to cool the spicy kickBut boy was this good! Hot and a little sweet the sauce was like a jazzed up tomato soupThe crab was delicious smothered in the sauceThe real culinary highlight of this trip - though not cheapThe restaurant is bright and airy and the staff very friendly and accommodatingWould love to return, again and agai
4
I was taken here for dinner by a couple of business colleagues and had been recommended to try the chilli crab by a friend here at home. One of my hosts was Singaporean who had worked in London, so he ordered a menu that I could not easily get here including deep fried baby squid, cereal prawns, vegetables and chilli crab.All the food was absolutely delicious served efficiently in this bustling beach-side restaurant. The East Coast Seafood Centre is very popular with locals and tourists alike as evidenced by the amount of available car parking, which was very busy on the evening of my visit. Not an easy place to get to be public transport though
1
The long wait didnt justify the high price tag with poor service.We sat on a table with 6 other strangers which we didnt mind although as we were seated before the others and had ordered, we were surprised that our food came out last.Our chili crab cost us $AUD 85.00 and was totally lacking in sauce.We asked the waitress if we could get some more sauce and we were ignored.The prawn dish was quite nice.We had also ordered some steamed buns to mop up the chili crab sauce and these didnt arrive with the crab...no point really as there was nothing to mop up.We asked if the buns were still coming and we received no answer, just a scowl.Lo and behold, they came out just as we were going to leave .They insisted that we pay for them even though they arrived after our meal was finished and we didnt eat them.We tried to speak with a manager but he wasnt interested either.This place is a tourist trap.Do yourself a favour and dont eat here!!!!!We have since found the best place for chili crab is at Changi Village. The food is delicious with friendly service and costs a quarter of the price at Jumbo Seafood
5
No this original restaurant of Jumbo Seaafood is not fancy, sufisticated, super clean, confortable, discrete, nicely decorated, easy to find, all english speaking personell or with stunning view . . . but its damn good, fresh, tasty and with Singaporian clasics like black pepper crab, yam ring scallops, chilli crab, fried baby squid, salted egg prawns and for the true fish fanatic: WHOLE Red Tilapia Deep Fried with Nonya Sauce! I visited this restaurant the first time in 1991 and the food concept didn't change a thing!If you to look for Jumbo Seafood but more fancy, sufisticated, clean, confortable, discrete, nicely decorated, easy to find or with stunning view? Go to one of the other outlets in the city
5
Went to Jumbo for Chili Crab, the one located at Clarke Quay. We arrived early and it was already very busy but no long wait. The food was excellent, crispy calamari heads delicious but when I saw the eyes were intact I lost my appetite. Excellent duck pancake and my companion tucked into and really enjoyed the chilli crab - the dish that Jumbo is famous for. An expensive meal
3
the food at jumbo seafood restaurant which i have been eaten many times but never write a review is delicious. this time i ate at clarke quay. the service was fair enough although they were very busy on sunday afternoon. but the unfair thing about this restaurant was it was very expensive while it was not fine dining. every thing from wet tissue,peanut,water and beer and food are expensive. that was not enough, it was more and more expensive when they added tax and service charge to your bill
2
We went to Jumbo East Coast for a birthday with family who had travelled here, service is not great, venue not great, food not great! I wouldnt go back...toilets quite gross too
3
Went there one evening with my wife and a colleague for chili crab. The food was very good but the service was poor (no smiles!).
4
The ambience of Clarke Quay will definitely enhance your dining experience at Jumbo. The Chilly Crab was amazing...the seafood is fresh and yummy.
5
Tonight I was the host and I did the ordering. Finally, just what I wanted, Prawns several ways, grilled tilapia, black pepper crab, chilli crab, lots of fried buns, seafood fried rice and broccoli. We spent about 70 USD per person -- but we got stuffed with awesome food. Sure, the service is spotty---but the night was perfect, we sat outside and enjoyed the hubbub---loud enough to know you are in a big, busy place but not so loud you cannot talk. I have been here many time before but never reviewed the place.... I am just a gigantic big fan of Jumbo and strongly prefer driving out to the East Coast location if the weather is good enough to sit outside.Not to be missed while in Singapore
3
We were recommended by a few people to try the chilli crab at jumbo's in Singapore. We ordered chilli crab and rice and buns as sides. Our sides took a long time to come out and we had to ask a few times. The meal was our most expensive meal in Singapore and was far from our favourite, was a good experience but we are not likely to return
4
Went twice during a recent trip to Singapore. The first time by myself, before my family arrived. With no reservation I was offered a seat at a large table with several other small groups. The second visit was with my family with a reservation. The service was poor on the first visit (ignored at the back table by myself) but fine on the second trip. I had been practicing making my own Chili crab for months before going, and found Jumbo's to be better than any recipe I tried. The crabs were huge, fresh and tasty. The second time we tried both the chili and pepper crabs, and found the pepper crab to not be as interesting. The crab is not cheap, but is worth the price. Be prepared to get messy eating it
4
We had first experience with Singapore chili crab here and the taste was very nice. The restaurant is suitable for Family, friend and business meeting. The restaurant is quite big but always full of customer reserved and walk-in. Jumbo is a nice restaurant that do not missed
5
Two words , chilli crab I am no sea food fan though have tried the chilli crab and it was yumm the buns to go with it and some creamy lemon prawns just do the trick of turning your dinner into an event eating a crab required skill and I am still learning, have visited a couple of times now
5
1.6kg pepper crab @ $92 and $55 for 1kg chilli crab! Amazing flavour and totally worth it. It was served really quickly and they had suprisingly cheap drinks! Get the small buns at .60c a piece they are slightly sweet and mop up the chilli sauce fantastically! Make sure you have reserved a table you will not be able to get in with out one. You can do so from online before going. Also make sure you have the right location to avoid being told when you arrive. Toilets were pretty crappy for a fancy place however. The staff should maintain this better. Amazing night to remember apart from this
4
A six of us went for a holiday in Singapore and we know that this is a must visited restaurant. We were so full with 2 types of Crab (chilli & pepper) - freshest ever !!. We also did ate fried rice, shrimp corn flakes,fried fish. I felt soso with the fish. But the rest was amazing. Of course, comes with its price as 330++ SGD.
4
You can't say you've done Singapore without a stop at Jumbo for chili and black pepper crab. Other seafoods are also good but this is the "must do" item. Do make reservations especially at Clarke Quay as they are always busy. Enjoy!!
3
No. The food doesn't taste like local food, it has been catered for tourists. Having said that, the place is packed. Maybe just not for my taste cuz I've eaten better
4
We had dinner here during our recent trip to Singpore and were not disappointed! The seafood was all fresh and plentiful! We had both red and black chilli crab- delicious! Also prawns and other seafood. Great meal, tons leftover!
3
We were told that this was the best place for chili crab, a Singapore specialty we wanted to try. It was very busy and the food going past looked good. The chili crab was tasty by very messy and in our opinion far too much work for the meager amount of actual edible matter. We also had to ask three or four times where our rice side dish was and it finally arrived as we were finishing the crab. Another side dish we ordered still had not arrived so we cancelled it. We would not go back there
5
Relaxed semi-outdoor casual dining. We loved the chilli crab! I also liked the mango soda soft drinks. It wasn't the cheapest meal in Singapore, but we think it was worth it. The place was very very busy too. Definitely worth the trip out to the east coast park.
4
The chilli crab is to die for and I think is their flagship dish. Almost every table in the house had it. The variety and choice on the menu was commendable. In value they were a little steep, but in all fairness, I think they have earned. The ambience was great, both indoors and outdoors. Outdoors was especially good with the Clarke Quay for a view. Word to the wise, make reservations ahead! It is a popular restaurant and both locals and tourists grace the place in hordes. We were lucky to get there quite early in the early evening to have a very late lunch, and we had to share a table, which was not all that bad. We got to mingle and got to know one another, and of course picture taking was reciprocal. The only downside was that I did not notice much of a kids menu, but my 4 year old survived well on the chicken fried rice. You could always improvise to take care of this
3
Had dinner with a group of 15. The Service was not very friendly (I rarely had a waiter that laughed when she spilled tea over my pants...), the coordination of food-service was not good (we had a variety of dishes, but somehow they managed to bring only one dish at a time, therefore the rice, brought "solo" at the end, was not eaten), the Price definitely seems to be at the higher end.A highlight is the area, and the way they cope with "sudden strong rainfall" - This part was great to watch
3
Definitely not the best seafood restaurant that serve chilli crab.They have this time restriction and force you out of the place within 2 hours. I dont know who likes to be rushed when comes to eating. Paid so much for company team event and ended up have to rush to finish our food and drinks. Go somewhere else
3
The food was lovely! The staff were arrogant and rude from beginning to end. Once seated we sat for 20 minutes before we finally asked for some service. We were rushed through the banquet for 4 people in an hour. The chilli crab was very nice, but there was no crab flavour at all. The red wine pork ribs were excellent though. Set menu A. $208. Add ribs, A jug of a Tiger beer + 3 apple juices for kids $339. It made a change from the hawkers food halls but was it worth it? N
3
It's always hard for me to get over the rudeness of the lady's who seat you. I've been several times to this restaurant just never get it, why they are like this. The food was average this visit. The star of the show the Chili Crab was overly sweet. The fried Talipa was well over cooked. for the cost these should always be perfect. Oh and don't mention to the staff that you thought something wasn't right they scowl at you then walk away.The upside the Tiger Beer was cold. The Scallops were nice.We went to Newtons the next night had a great Chili Crab for half the cost.This restaurant is in a prime location and always full, based on the their attitude I don't they'd even consider a not favorable review
5
Enjoyed the seafood very much. Would advice to make an advance reservation beforehand otherwise the place is usually full.
All the food are delicious.....
4
We ordered a 1.2kg crab (Black Pepper), cereal shrimp (small), vegetable (small), 1 beer and 2 drinks. Food is good and more than enough for two!
4
Outdoor dining, generous portions and great chili crab and pepper crab. The center spinning lazy susan makes sharing a meal fun and delicious. Don't wear a light colored top -- the meal can be messy! Dig in and enjoy.
5
Must try!
Prawn in cup
Deep fried beancurd special
Salted egg golden prawns
And of course the award winning CHILLI CRABS
4
I was there with other 4 colleagues. We were having a very good dinner time. We arriced at around 8.30 pm and the waiter firmly asked us to wait as we booked a table from 9 pm. We could easily see that the restaurant was full and therefore we were ok to wait a while. The restaurant was located on the riverside so there are many things to see while waiting. No issue at all.At exactly 9 pm we got our table and the order was delivered within approximately 10 minutes and so. Understanding the hecticness, this is still reasonable. We were amused since they provided us with this apron which perhaps we have never used it anymore since we were 7 years old :)The food was GREAT! We ordered scallops, crabs, vegetables, fried rice, shrimp, etc. Everything was delicious.I would definitely be back in the short future, I just need to ensure that I book in advance
5
After recommendations from a family friend we booked dinner at jumbo tonight for chilli crabs. Reading mixed reviews on TripAdvisor of the place I must admit I was reluctant but boy was it amazing. We got told we won't get a booking till 9pm so that's when we went. The service was excellent. A plate for the crab shells. Speedy service on meals and the taste was amazing. Would definitely recommend going here for chilli crabs if that's what your after but booking is essential for weekends from what I was told.
4
We had a family lunch @ East Coast Jumbo.....Superb! :) :) :)Fresh seafood wonderfully prepared...lovely indeed!We enjoyed it greatly !This place is near the beach, U can take a walk at the beach after lunch too. ooooh HOT!!!! If you are having dinner.....nice sea breeze - sometimes.If you hate the heat....They have Air-Con dinning @ level 2.Great place to have "Singapore's Chilli Crab"!Enjoy!See pics
1
Out of curiosity we accepted , when we were offered an appointment for our reservation from 8pm. To 9,15pm. , we arrived just in time the arrogant receptionist woman reminded us that we have to leave on time ... Ok, we ordered soup , peppered and chilli crabs .Expecting to get something exceptional , but it was a great disappointment , something tasteless which I did n't like at all , we could n't even feel comfortable as they were watching us all the time to push us to finish our meal quickly !!!! And the worst was the bill , over .. over priced. All and all , it was a night of regret hhhhhhh . Never mind one bad dinner in Singapore , BUT NEVER AGAI
4
I was on a 5h layover from Australia back to Europe. I took a cab from the airport to Jumbo East Coast to meet with friends. It was really worth it. I had both black pepper and chilli crabs. Very tasty and well worth the trip out of the airport
4
Almost every second trip to Singapore I have made sure to indulge in a Black Pepper crap. I have tried many places, and most were good but I must admit Jumbo was possibly the best.According to my wife, she also thoroughly enjoyed the Chili Crab.It is probably a 5 star place, but I gave it 4 as I do still find it a little on the pricey side of things
4
Chinese Seafood paradise ... Fresh, Chinese style, crowded (make a reservation if rush hours); food is very nice. Especially the chili crab their speciality.
5
I prefer the Head office Branch at the East Coast Beach. You can enjoy a stroll along the beach.
Personally I enjoy the crabs the most... Pepper crabs, Chilli crabs and the best of all plain Steam crabs( please ask for ones with Roes)
4
Craving for crab, that is the place to go. The sauce is different from the local seafood store in the heartland.
4
You need a big appetite to be able to taste all the varieties of dishes they offer in the restaurant.
2
Ordered Red Garouper but being served Black "Garouper" (or other fish??). Server cut the fish, trying to debone - the fish meat were soft (fresh one will have firm meat as I have ordered in other restaurants before and nothing to do with what sauce since it was steamed) and become messy that I stopped her for further " mincing the fish". It was not of good quality as I tasted Red Grouper and know its appearance The fish served has black skin and definitely not a RED Garouper that I ordered that showed clearly at the colored Menu. The price at S$10 per 100 gm. It was over $75. When questioned, explanations given such as "it is correct, it is Red Garouper (with black skin???), all in the fish tank, you should state the color you want .....". It was truly dishonest , I definitely pointed at the picture at the Menu And ordered a RED Garouper. Where went wrong ? Either the one who catch the fish do not know how a Red Garouper looks like or I am short changed??? I was not happy with the answers and paid and left. I believed diners willing to pay and expected food to be served what has been ordered. The black pepper crab was good. The Red Garouper was definitely not of value at all!!!! Felt cheated.  Bill showed clearly as Red Garouper. Being unjustified, I checked with nearby restaurant who has Red Garouper in its Menu and at same price of $10 per 100 gm (seems to be market price). When I questioned that not with black skin, the reply was "we do not serve inferior quality, only RED Garouper. This confirmed the answer.
4
We visited the branch at East coast Park with "beach" views! Great location, buzzy atmosphere in packed restaurant. Had to wait (not long) for a table, so maybe it's worth making a reservation. Food is served up each dish as it's ready and all dishes were faultless during our visit. Huge prawns, perfect scallops, spicy dishes were super spicy, all washed down with a well priced jug of Tiger beer. Would definitely visit again.
4
Unless you like heat I would recommend the cracked pepper crab, or any of the other items on the menu. If you "eat the heat" you will need lot's of Tiger Beer. Which is served by the Tiger Beer young woman in uniform:) You need to make reservations early for the Riverwalk location. These are very busy restaurants
1
Well, it is pretty obvious that in such a location, the restaurants would be more inclined to rip you off rather than serving great food. In touristic places, there is no incentive to retain customers :)So we fell for that trap!We were seated by a big table, shared with 8 other eaters in different stages of crab dismantling. We didn't go for the couple menu - and I think that was a wise decision. The dragon fruit salad was tasteless. The scallops felt under-cooked. The crab was so tiny! Just 700 grams! And messy to eat. The plates were little, and the staff did not provide a dish to put the shells in! They have also given us only 1 set of utensils for crab meet - so we had to share! We were served the crab, but no one ever brought the aprons! If you ever succeed eating chilli crab without messing your entire outfit, let me know :) The staff was very non-attentive! For this price I would've expected much higher quality and service.I enjoyed much more in the Red House, which is also touristic, but the food is much more flavorful
5
The last couple of times we were in Singapore, hubby and I went to Long Beach which is next door to Jumbo but we decided to try Jumbo this time because we wanted to wear the Jumbo bib! We also usually get chilli crab but decided to try the black pepper crab this time which was awesome and so was the bamboo clams and sambal kangkong! All this only cost us Sg$110 which is much less than what we would pay in Australia. Glad we came here! Just a tip, get here early or you'll be waiting a while before you get a table. Oh and don't expect good service..
4
We arrived on Thursday the 6th March at 7pm with no booking and were taken immediately to an outdoor table. We ordered the chilli crab, scallops in yam, broccoli in oyster sauce and rice. The food was excellent and the service attentive. The only area for improvement is to add mixed vegetables to the menu
4
Went with the wife for Chilli crab. Good meal. 58 s $ for a kg of crab and 28 s $ for a couple of pints, so excellent food, reasonable value with fair but quick service. Would go again.
4
The chili crab is a must try for your first time visit overseas friends and the sauce is just nice for them (i.e. not too spicy). On top of this, you must also order the fried mini sotong. Another must try too!
3
Not beyond my expectation but should a be good enough experience for most tourists.
various dishes were nice.
try the prawns and chilli crab.
arrive early for nice seats..
4
Tried their white pepper crab at East coast. It's really delicious. We also had avocado dessert which tasted nice and special with the dried ice presentation.
2
This restaurant and location were recommended as a 'must-do' in Singapore. After reading various reviews online, I was hit or miss on whether or not to make booking. I wish I had skipped, or at least tried a closer location. Our booking was for 7P. We were whisked quickly to a table by the river - so great view - although never asked our name to confirm the booking. The drinks gal was quick, and then the food gal took our order. Waiting. Waiting. More Waiting. HOURS later, we received our food - and although highly irritated (mainly by hunger) - I still found it to be just average. The evening went downhill from there as it then took over an hour to get a taxi. I was on the phone with assorted taxi companies while waiting in line, repeatedly being told - too busy or won't drive to East Coast. Never again
4
A regular spot and a must visit every time we venture to Singapore. A trip without a decent serve would not be complete. As always, jumbo serves, quickly too, a delicious sized saucy crab layered with thick eggy chili sauce and a few buns on the side hits the spot. With the chilled jelly fish as an entree, jumbo hasn't let us down to date. A trust reliable friend and a must visit in Singapore
3
The food is good don't get me wrong but it's over-priced for local goodies. If you are local, you won't need to eat here. The service is good and all but this is more of a place to bring a foreign friend to impress with ambience and more 'friendly' taste
5
My wife was recommended this place by a colleague so when we visited Singapore in December we tried it.The one she was recommended was quite a way from where we were staying but we asked a waitress in Raffles who said there was one at Clarke Quay , so off we went.The first thing is the surroundings, especially at night, loads of riverside restaurants and stores all lit up and reflected in the river,Then came the food................WOW After talking to the friendly and helpful waiter some of our party went for a starter, I didn't and after waiting for the starters to be finished the Chilli Crab arrived MEGA WOW. Individual terrines with a monster of a crab in each (the waiter had advised on just under 1kg) in a rich and gorgeous chilli sauce.While most of the body meat was mixed in with the sauce there was still loads of fun to be had with the claws etc ,thank god they give you bibs Great food , Great experienc
5
Wow is how I would describe the chilli crab :)Great service, reasonably priced, food was great..Make sure you book at least 2 days prior, as they are very popular, unless you want to stand and wait in line for a free table, which we were told one night the earliest table would not be until after 9:15 pm.Just be mindful that the tea, and peanuts that are placed on your table are not complementary . No big deal as they are cheap but it would be nice to be told that these items are not free..Can't wait to return on our next trip to singapore
5
The seafood served by Jumbo are really good - very fresh and tasty! You may give yourself a good treat to the steamed prawns, fish and especially the crabs. Don't miss the crabs! You will enjoy! So far, I have visited the outlets at East Coast, Dempsey and Changi. They were all just as great
5
We were a group of 4 and had selected a set menu for six and we never knew when we had finished the large portions. The crabs were excellent!
4
When you visit Singapore, crabs are a must have and this place serves one of the best chilli crabs in town!
Order: Lobster sashimi, chilli crab, creamy salted egg crab, cereal prawns, steamed seabass!
5
Don't miss out on the signature dishes - chilli and black pepper crab; and drunken prawns. For chilli crab, side order of fried Chinese buns are a must to scoop off the sauce
5
Love the food at Jumbo, but I guess they can still improve in their services despite the challenge of catering to several customers at the same time
4
The food is good and the location and view are great, but the price is a bit rich with better alternatives nearby at East Coast Hawker Centre - albeit not with the same ambience, but with better atmosphere
2
I used to frequent the Jumbo outlet at Serangoon Garden Club before it was closed down to make way for another restaurant. The food there used to be quite good, and certainly good value for money. In recent trips to their other outlets, I must say the quality of their food has gone to the gutters. The chilli crab is not even worth mentioning.For those of you who love chilli crab, I would recommend trying Chin Huat Seafood at Clementi. Their crab, as well as other seafood dishes, are much, much better
4
There are more than one outlet of Jumbo Seafood but regardless of the day in a week, all outlets are always filled with people. I have visited all outlets more than 3 times over half a year and I have to wait even though I have made reservation. Despite the long waiting time, the food is good, albeit expensive, and it somehow made me want to patronize it again. Although the restaurant is filled with people, service crews are generally patience and serve with a smile. One area which I think the management of the restaurant should look into - customers are given "deadline" to complete the meal. Each time I reserve a table, I am always asked whether I can complete my meal within a certain time. For example, I reserve a table for meal at 7pm, I would be asked whether I can complete my meal by 7.45pm. I do not think this is being customer-centric. Customers are there to enjoy a meal at a premium price and do not want to be told to leave at a time stipulated by the restaurant

Chili crabs and the bamboo clams sauteed in garlic are consistently good. So are the noodle dishes. Service isn't so prompt, but normally, when one goes to Jumbo, one is with a group of friends and the cheerful conversations make one almost forget the slow service. In more than one occasion, orders were swtiched with other people's, so my personal tip is to check the bill especially when in a big group and it's easy to overlook which items were ordered.Of all the branches, I like the one at Dempsey Hill the most. It's the best-appointed and a good place to take tourists out to. One can get a card that allows a 10% discount on every visit and a cake during one's birthmonth
3
I bring my foreign friends to Jumbo when it is their first visit to Singapore. There are few outlets in Singapore and I found the one at East Coast Seafood Centre is the best among the rest. Price is at high side and at times, the seafood especially the crab does not have quality as at before. My foreign friends love this place at their first visit but when I brought them to other restaurants, all of them swing other preferences to others. Perhaps due to the crowd, the staff are not so friendly and helpful as before.There are other restaurants located at the heartland which offer a much better quality seafood at a reasonable price
4
The crabs are usually ok, just need to remind the staff that you will reject the dish if crab is not meaty. The prawn is reasonably good. For the same price, it is probably better to patronise Dempsey Hill branch as the ambient is much better there
3
Firstly be aware you will be charged for the peanuts on the table (even though you did not order them) and they serve shark-fin soup. Next realize that seafood in Singapore is not cheap but this restaurant is very busy so you may need to book even for lunch. The service was so so not to rave about but not bad either. We had the pepper crab (OK but not the best crab I have had, better in Borneo) my husband ordered deep-fried shrimps, they were fine and so was the venison. Add two fruit juices and you have $120.oo for lunch for two. I probably would not go again to be honest
1
This was far and away the worst meal I had in Singapore. I ordered the crispy calamari and was served a tasteless crunchy totally ruined meal. You know it is a tourist trap because they have peanuts at your setting that they charge you for whether you eat them or not. They also pour you tea without asking and charge you for that. They do have side orders of vegetables and that is not common in Singapore. When I asked for tap water I was given a glass of warm water. The service is nothing special. All in all, you would do better eating anyway else in Singapore
4
I've visited the East Coast Park Seafood Centre on and off over the last 30 years, and Jumbo many times. The Chilli Crab is still the best in town. Service is a little haphazard, but the location on the waterfront and the other diners provide great entertainment. We went on a Wednesday evening right after arriving from London, got a table early without reservation, and had a great evening
2
The crab is nice for sure but i feel the service has gone vrry bad in the last few years, up to the point where i will not give them another chance. Had to order several times, no smile no welcome, no thank you for 200 SGD spent for 4. We felt part of a factory. Maybe sunday night are busier than other days. Anyway that is not a reason to charge us for several peanuts, tea, towels we did not use..
3
First of all, a restaurant still serving shark fin soup should not be visited by anyone!We know this place for over 20 years, but to our opinion the food used to be better. The prices are stiff, which reflects the nice location at the east coast. As we visited as a big group, we choose a lot of different dishes. Crab, shrimps, clams, squid fish you name it. The taste ok but not special. I guess this is the price for a huge restaurant with a kitchen working like a factory.Based on this experience you can get better seafood in some hawker centers than in this place
3
We went to Jumbos on the 23rd January a Thursday night and it was so busy. It is a real eye opener. The amount of people going through amazing. We of course went for chilli crab and it was great but I would recommend taking tissues or wet ones as it is very messy to eat. The woman who took our order was very bossy and we did not see a menu - basically had what she thought. The crab is expensive and charged by weight. It was a real experience and that made it worthwhile. Something I am sure I will not forget
5
The chili crab here is amazing and very famous. But I found the other dishes I had (papaya salad and sauted kai-lan) equally delicious. But these restaurants (there are multiple locations) fill up quickly. Took me a week to get an opening at a reasonable hour. Luckily you can book online so I'd suggest doing that a few weeks before your trip
3
my friend and i went for dinner and we ordered nice chilli crabs scallops and vegys.. service was very poor, i was so disappointed and wanted to leave due to the fact that we waited for more than an hour for them to serve the food
4
Jumbo is a chain specialising in Seafood. It was very busy for a Wednesday night and you need to book. Service is friendly but eccentric. The vegetables came long before the rest of the order. Dont have the chilli crab as the taste of crab is lost. Otherwisr it was all very good and (wine excepted) good value
5
This restaurant was recommended to us by the taxi driver on the way from the airport. It is a chain of seafood restaurants about the harbor side. we tried riverview point first for the views but couldn't get a table then we went to Clarke Quay. the same thing just no views.we ordered a 1.4 kg chili crab between the three of us this the smallest one they had. the all experience was good you get given a bib to wear and a bowl of lemon water to wash your handsthe chili crab was massive. the sauce was very chili (just be careful if you don't like hot foods as the chili makes your mouth tingle) and full of crab meat around the crab itself. we ordered a litre of beer between the three of us. A fun night out. a bit pricey but worth it
5
We can choose fish and crab which ever you want them to cook for you. Which is a very rare experience in country which i come from.
Loved it and surely recommend for others.
1
My friend and I went for dinner.. food was great but service was so bad that we waited for an hour to get the food. We asked the waitress many times and still we waited for 15 more minutes.. I was really disappointed.
4
This place is extremely busy and has a high turnover for diners. However it is managed really well. The only gripe is the dining session is approx 90 minutes per booking.The singapore chilli crab was delicious and I highly recommend it, service was good too and great value.Would I return? Absolutely
4
Worth the wait! We couldn't get a reservation so we decided to wait in the queue for 30 minutes. Ordered the Chili Crab and Seafood Rice. It is quite messy to eat but so worth it. Highly recommend. If you can manage a table outside it would be better. Bring extra wet wipes, you'll need them
4
well after queuing for 35 minutes,the food served was exquisite,delicious and delightful,there was a waiting time,but once seated the service was fast efficient and first class,beverages were expensive,the food was as good as it gets,fresh,fully flavoured and plentiful,well worth the wait and a must when visiting the Clarke quay area in Singapore
4
We had both the black pepper and chilli crabs (S$60/kg each) which were fantastic! The crabs were cooked to perfection. Succulent, sweet, tender and juicy, bursting with freshness in every bite. Definitely a far cry from the water crabs you find elsewhere. Highly recommended! The mini mantous were a perfect compliment to the chilli crab gravy, although the chilli crab isn't for the faint hearted as it can be quite spicy.Cereal prawns ($20 for a small plate of 8 prawns/$22 for a small plate of shelled prawns) were very good too. The prawns were bouncy and sweet, while the cereal was crispy and tasty, without being overwhelming. Bamboo clams (S$12 per clam) were nicely done, large and chewy, complete with vermicelli, fried garlic and a slightly sweet soy sauce. Bf and I really enjoyed this meal. I hope you do too! :)
4
Fun place to go with a group. Food is served family style. The chili crab and black pepper crab were great. The fried rice was average. Atmosphere is a little crazy, but keep the Tiger girl busy pouring the beer and you'll have a blast. The servers seemed a little frazzled and a bit blunt, but the huge crabs make up for it.
2
While visiting Singapore, I wanted to try chilli crab, but my family was not interested. The crabs were great, but the other food we ordered...was weird. The crispy squid was so hard fried that they were almost like corn nuts or squid nuts. Most of the dishes we ordered were not whole seafood. In fact, I'm not sure what they were. Even the golden chicken we ordered wasn't made of whole chicken, but some sort of chicken patty. The service was very poor. My daughter never received a drink and we had to wait an eternity to order additional drinks after we had consumed ours.Our bill? $200! I would only go back for the crab and nothing else. I'm sure I can find chilli crabs elsewhere anyways
4
I had read other reviews and was keeping an open mind about my visit. It was Monday night and I simply rocked up, without much expectation. I was seated within 10 minutes, and made my order within another 5 minutes. A beer arrived soon after with the crab coming 15 minutes (max) later. The crab was excellent - which was the reason I came. It is a very busy (and obviously popular) restaurant in a very touristy area. If you are super fussy about service then perhaps you should book ahead and plan your visit carefully. Personally, I had a great time and thought it was reasonably priced, with attentive service and clean facilities. I would go again and recommend to friends
3
i was looking forward to a great feast but was disappointed. The baby squid were so small they seemed prematured! The Groupa was small for a S72$ price. The chili Dungeness Crab was excellent but messy to eat. Unfortunately one can't enjoy the chili sauce even do there a lots of it but nothing to eat it with, your fingers are basted and the crab meat to flaky to dip it in the sauce. Do not order this plate on a first date, hihihi. Cover for 6 with a pitcher of beer, soft drinks S$300. Next time, I will try something else, elsewher
3
The Chili Crab is excellent, but since the restaurant is crowded, the service suffers slightly. Don't exoect to get tissue other than the wet towel they provide on the table. Be sure to book for a table or come before six o'clock to get seats.
4
Visited jumbo with a bunch of friends ... Ordered a wide variety of food ranging from the famous chilli crab to the vegetarian options ... Amazing food ....
A must eat 😄
4
Seafood, espacially chili crab is singapore's signature dish. Nice viewacross the street of singapore towards indonesian Batam island. Not cheap, but consistent high quality
2
Arrived lunchtime to find the restaurant about 3/4 full. Took that as a good sign. We ordered a couple of beers and a main course. Beers arrived - no problem, after about another 15 minutes my food arrived and that tasted delicious (scallops and asparagus). After waiting for about 10 minutes I started eating mine so that it didn't go cold. In the meantime another young couple sat down next to us and ordered their food. After about another 10-15 minutes their food arrived but still no sign of my husband's. At this point he got up and went to the till and asked for a bill. He was told (not asked) by the manager to sit down. Fortunately just before he erupted his food arrived at the table. His food was also of a good standard (seafood fried rice). When we go to a restaurant together we expect to eat together. As you can imagine we were not impressed
4
We had two types of chilli and black pepper crabs, steamed prawns, beef hor fun and Chinese New Year special complimentary Yusheng! The food and excellent service was well worth waiting for. The price was comparable by Singapore standards and definitely worth checking out. You need to book early as the place is always full. Very satisfied family dinner out
1
The environment is ok, food is ok but service is bad. We ordered chili crab and black pepper crab together, but takes an hour for the chili crab to cook and another extra15 mins for the black pepper crab to cook. And realized that they cook all the chili/black pepper crab together, coz saw they delivery the chili crab to the 2 tables beside us although we place order in different time. I go to this restsurant, coz my frd recommendation but will never again, as the restaurant beside cook the chili crab better than Jumbo. Jumbo black pepper crab is o so, there are many restaurant in SG cook much better
1
We booked 8 pm on February the first for dinner.when we arrived.they tons us we have to leave 9.15 pm whatever happens.we ordered pumpkin soap and crabs.we did nt enjoy our meal as they kept reminding us to finish.employee are arrogant and non hospitable .the restaurant does not worth the 203 dollars paid in this bad mea
3
If you're looking for the Singapore Chili Crab experience, this is one of the original and authentic places. The problem is that as it's become famous, it's cannot manage the rush effectively. The food has become more assembly line, though still good and the service sucks. Try the corn flake prawns along with the Chili/Black pepper crab. Good if you're visiting Singapore, once in a while.The setting by the water is nice
3
well we thought this would be nice , no music or atmosphere, the staff couldnt speak a word of english i asked what something was and after 3 people coming over was just told so sorry , so we ordered only 2 things that we could work out fried rice and a chicken dish it was disappointing to say the least the setting was nice as its floating on the water such a shame. Train your staff to speak english at least one of them 
4
We loved the food but even though hours for lunch are 11-3:00, we got there at 1:45 and were instantly told last order will be 2pm and bill will be brought at 2:30. It was brought at 2:10 and clean up and breakdown of tables & chairs was done all around us, while we ate. The service was rushed and not very hospitable. In short it operates like a factory where there timing has priority over service. Too bad, good service would have made it pleasantly memorable unfortunately I wouldn't go back.
4
Had the urge to sample the award winning chilli crab. We accompanied it with some seafood fried rice and baby choi. Great taste but so, so messy.
A simple tasty lunch but a little pricy.
4
The seafood is good with Chili Crab worth giving a try. However, for this $$$ I expect greater atmosphere, less casual. While making a reservation, make sure to sit outside.
4
Amazing food and great value. Location in Clarke Quay right next to the river was very easy to get to. Service is terrible though (non existent) - we continually tried to flag down wait staff to take our order but the ones that were around just ignored us. Took about 15 mins before we got someone. Turns out that there was only one waitress who was going around from table to table taking the orders,but none of the other wait staff bothered to tell us that. Terrible. Go for the food and just don't expect service and you'll be fine. Highly recommend the chilli crab with steamed buns.
4
First, it was not easy to get a dinner reservation. My hotel booked it for me, but the restaurant initially stated that I had no reservation. We were then ignored while others were seated. Finally, we were given a table and told that we had to leave/finish eating in 90 minutes. Really not a good start to what is supposed to be a relaxing dinner.We ordered the chili crab, which was very good. I would recommend ordering a bowl of rice to soak up the delicious sauce. We ordered some of the fried buns, but they were too small to soak up the sauce. We also ordered the pepper crab - not very good. What was outstanding were the scallops in "yam/sweet potato" according to the menu. However, it was really a jumbo scallop in taro root and deep fried - awesome.Based on recommendations, we ordered the shell-less cereal shrimp. The cereal was too sweet; the salt and pepper version would have been much better.The "very good" rating is for the food. As for service, it was only a two-star
5
This is an awesome food joint and not just for Sea food - had some super ribs soaked in maple syrup and the crabs were just spicy and yummy. The Prawns were really big and tasted fresh - scallops was for me the first time done to perfection and was really made the Asian way
3
I took some overseas guests for chili crab at the East Coast Park Jumbo in early December, having sung the praises of the food. We sat upstairs in the aircon section, due to the weather at the time. Despite there being few people before us, and the waiter taking our order promptly, service to our table was slow compared to other tables and items on our order had to be reordered but there was no clear explanation of the reason why the items had been omitted. The upstairs part is a bit of a barn, and by the time our main course finally arrived the restaurant was heaving and noisy. I have had a better experience there in the past, but my last visit was over a year ago
4
This restaurant is a signature place to bring your visitors from overseas. The seafood is fresh and the crabs are huge. Wait staff is friendly and we had no delays for drinks or food, despite it being a busy Saturday night. Our friends from Australia really enjoyed the experience, the food, and the vibe. We saw several large tables of business people having a blast and it seems a good food forum for company parties. This is a testimony to the kitchen and the wait staff who deliver delicious food and traditional Singapore cuisine in a timely manner with a smile
4
On a recent visit to Singapore I dragged my lovely husband to this lovely restaurant by the river across the way from Clark's Quay.In all the years I have been coming to Singapore no visit is complete without a meal at Jumbo's. On this particular evening with monsoon rains lashing and thunder and lightning threatening, we opted to sit outside and enjoy the BIG rain! We ordered the chilli crab and my unsuspecting husband got "bibbed"! Yes in order as to not make a mess of his lovely shirt they gave him a bib!! As u can imagine hilarity ensued and a lovely meal was had by us!!The food is sublime but the ambience is hard to match as there is nothing like it for value and fun! It maybe on the pricey side but hey it is fresh seafood that doesnt come cheap anywhere in the world.If u can do it as it will leave lasting memories and tasty ones too
4
At Jumbo Seafood The Riverwalk(Gallery) I and my family had a great dining experience. Crab was so very delicious and service as not bad. But I agree with other folks on the review that it's overpriced. I have had many more qualify seafoods on other Southern East Asia countries than in Jumbo Singapore
4
We always eat here at least once on our holidays to Singapore. Although I must admit its getting a bit pricey to eat here. The chilli crab is always good and every other dish we order is great. Eating by the water is always a trea
4
Signature Black Pepper Crab, seafood fried rice really good and the waiter was very nice and gentle crowded and needs reservation
4
I went there with a friend for dinner. The food offered was good and reasonably priced. The restaurant staff service was impressive. Would visit there again for sure.
5
Terrific food, Chilli crab is a must have !! Don't worry about the mess they give you a big bib and moist wipes to clean up with.
Great location on the river walk. Easy to get to by cab from anywhere in the city.
4
To test chili crab in Singapore is a must, and this place was great. The food took a little long to get, otherwise higher grade would be given.
4
let me give u my frank analysis:CHILLI CRAB@ Jumbo is a refined dish, served in a nice zinc claypot, fragrant but which do i prefer? Long Beach or Jumbo?CHILLI CRAB@ Long Beach...presentation is bland, but trust me, the GRAVY/sauce is more authentic than Jumbo, but why do we pay a premium at JUMBO? Coz its a better dining experience overall..
4
This is a good place for groups with kids as the atmosphere is casual and they can run around on the riverwalk. Reservations are a good idea because the place is crowded. Easy to get to/from by taxi.The menu is fairly extensive. Mostly the food is good though not exceptional but I have to call out the salted fish fried rice as being really excellent
5
We had friend coming over from Hong Kong. So we invited them dinner at Jumbo Restaurant. The restaurant very crowded. If you want to dine there, make sure to have reservationChilli crab very good. Deep fried fish nyonya style very unique. Prawn very fresh Should try
4
I was hesitant to go to Jumbo because of the amount of mediocre to poor reviews over the web. But after more research into other places that sell chili crab, I acquiesced to my partner's wishes and made a reservation at this location.First the facts: yes, you do pay for the peanuts and tea. We refused the tea and they took it off the bill. Yes, the crab can set you back a bit. If you are on a budget, skip it. I mean, you'll be missing out. But you're on a budget. The service is okay. Some hovering but that never bothers me because I just look up and smile and tell them I'm not ready. They eventually get it.Ok, here's why you go: CHILI CRAB! Listen, try the other stuff if you want. We had the spinach skin tofu and the supreme fried rice. Both were actually quite tasty. But come here for what may be the messiest, most delicious crab you will EVER HAVE! I consider myself a crab fanatic. This may be the best crab I have ever put in my mouth. Why? It's the chili sauce. You can practically pour that on any other seafood or poached chicken or your tongue and you will be satisfied. The chili sauce is downright AMAZING! The tenderness of the crab just adds to the entire situation. One crab feeds two big eaters. I seriously would have ordered another one.I'll speak of the service at this location. I come from New York City where service in many Chinese restaurants is barely acceptable. I also have to say that I work the service industry. The service is standard. Nothing more. Nothing less. They were slightly pushy in getting me to pay the bill but that's cause we were there when lunch was closing out. They didn't kick us out but they definitely did a "last call" and asked us to pay the bill.Ambiance is standard for any tourist spot. Clean enough but the restrooms could use a good scrub down. I did love that they had sinks outside of the toilets to wash your hands after getting intimate with your crab. Overall, I would recommend Jumbo. Specifically, this location. And go for lunch to avoid the dinner madness
5
Well.... I visited this restaurant as I am fond of eating crabs... but never knew it would be so scrumptious and finger licking crabs that we ordered for not one but two crabs. Also the fried bun added an unique taste to the Award Winning Chilli Crab and Signature Black Pepper crab...The ambience as well as the scenic view of the sea was added attraction for dinner. We were seated for almost 3 hours. A beautiful experience and an Amazing Meal. That is now on my wish list for my next visit to Singapore...
5
We were recommended this restaurant by our hotel concierge. We walked in and were lucky enough to get a table (the place was packed and it is noisy so don't go if you want a quiet place).We had the Chilli Crab (of course) and it was spicy, delicious and messy (don't worry they give you a large bib). We also tried the cereal prawns which I loved, but my partner wasn't so much a fan of eating an entire fried prawn.The food is great and the staff provide an excellent service. I had never cracked apart a crab shell before and the waiter was more than happy to explain how to use the tools :)Best part is that the cocktails inside the restaurant are dirt cheap, I recall them equating to about 6.50 AUD, which is half price when compared to the bars and restaurants around it. The Singapore sling and Around the world cocktails are winners
3
If you want to really enjoy the food AND the ambience, go to the East Coast Parkway venue. Dempsey rd food is the same but the venue cannot be compared. Prices seem a lot higher at Dempsey, not the budget place it used to be.
3
food is decent.the price is a little on the high side. but the service leaves much to be desired.they may deny your reservation (happened more than once to me).they are always harried and rushed. clitter, clatter.they can't wait for you to finish and go.food on the oily side.vegetables are an afterthought
4
This is one of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore. The service is fast and the food is good. By using technology, the communication between the waitress and kitchen is fast. This ensures quick service and we got our food in no time. The food is fresh and reasonably priced. It is no wonder that there is a queue at the restaurant every day. Get the VIP promotion to enjoy better value. The best dish is the black pepper crab.The location is convenient with ample car park although it is a 3 minutes' walk away. This venue is especially fun on the eve of new year as we can see the flash lights shot from the ships anchoring nearby. The restaurant will also celebrate the arrival of the new year with patrons and staff.They have a combination of seats with no aircon but we get to enjoy the sea breeze and seats with aircon on the 2nd floor. The aircon seats are not so user-friendly to people with mobility difficulty although the outdoor seats have ample space for wheelchairs and strollers
4
Relaxed outdoor atmosphere with good food. Look for Christina Lee who will recommend and plan a nice meal for you. Always check the price as some seafood can be very expensive and seafood prices in all Singapore restaurants' menu are actually the price for per 100g.Jumbo east coast park is THE place we bring our visiting friends from overseas. And its always followed by a 10 mins stroll to the Lagoon Food Court for Singaporeans' desserts such as the Ice Kacang! We love the local scene here but avoid weekends' evening!
5
I was a bit apprehensive about this restaurant as it was in a touristy area. However, I was very surprised by the quality of the food - the crab was so fresh and perfectly cooked. We had both the chilli crab and black pepper crab both superb. Would definitely recommend it
3
the food was fresh and delicious but the service was harried and rushed, i guess it was because it was the holiday season and they were shorthandedi will be back when its not a peak period and i would recommend the steamed prawns and the chilli crabs stay away from the fried rice cause the cook was heavy handed with the salt all in all, it was an enjoyable visit and i would be back agai
4
Chilli crab gravy taste well with the fried buns. Ask for crabs to be well cracked to avoid too much fuss in cracking them yourself and risk dirtying your clothes. If you enjoy doing it, ask for disposable aprons to be worn by the friendly staff
3
This is a classical tourist trap. The food is decent but it is seriously overpriced and it is not uncommon for them to make errors on the bill. It caters mainly to tourists and corporates. It is on the waterfront offering unparalleled views of long strings of container ships awaiting their turn to offload at the port. It is generally too crowded for my liking.
5
Recently had a dinner with my China friends there & was really impressed by their service, their staff was very friendly, service was fast although it was very crowded on that night they managed to served all the dishes in time. Liked the chilli crab very much I think it is one of the best in Singapore after trying the same dish in some other restaurants
4
This is one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore. Food is very good - love the pepper crab, cereal prawns, fried buns with chili sauce and honeydew sago. The service is very efficient (though not particularly friendly). And its nice to be out on the water, especially at dusk. If you go on the weekend, be sure to make a reservation or go early (around 6pm) as it fills up very quickly
5
Had a hosted seafood special night in the private dining room with both Chili and Black a Pepper Crab that made it a special evening. The service was attentive and prices reasonable. Recommend it.
3
Went to this restaurant as requested by a friend visited from overseas. They heard about this restaurant from travel guide. As a 'local', we know where you can find a better one with reasonable price. Anyway, it was invited by my friend and it's not nice to make any comment. Foods on menu can be found in most of stalls in hawker centre or cheaper restaurant and definitely taste as good as or even better. I found it all dishes taste similar e.g chill crab, prawn even meat dishes. It doesn't impress me express the price
4
My two Thai friends are new to Singapore but they have read about Jumbo seafood from the guidebooks. So I walked them down the Singapore River around Clarke Quay to Jumbo!It was a Sunday night but hell crowded it was! We were told that there might be a wait of half and hour but got a seat in less than ten minutes! Their queueing system is very efficient, they do not prefer for you to be choosy about whether you sit by the river or not though.We ordered the Chilli crab and fried buns (mantou). It was my recommendation as the sauce is distinctly local. Will recommend for all to try out the black pepper version as well for the fragrance in the crab meat. The thais loved the sauce and almost drank it up!They liked the cereal prawn and three yolk spinach too. It is however a little below standard. I preferred spicier cereal and more creamy spinach. All in all, it was a memorable positive experience for the expats. Highly recommended
4
Had a great time here getting acquainted with chili crab in Singapore. As with any of the more popular chili crab locations, the price is a bit high, but overall not too bad for dinner by Singapore standards. The dim sum and Chinese food options were quite good as well. We personally thought our mango and duck salad was the best part of the meal. One major complaint: where are the NAPKINS?!! Maybe I'm just a messy American, but I had a lot of trouble eating the chili crab and keeping neat. Bring your own paper towels as you only get 1 moist napkin and a bib from the restaurant! Service was only ok and we had some difficulty getting drinks
4
My wife and I had to have chilli crab in Singapore and where better to do this than at Jumbo. We ate at the Riverwalk restaurant at Clarke Quay which is very convenient all major hotels. The atmosphere was good and the food was very tasty. We will eat there again next time we're in Singapore
5
It was my second visit at Jumbo East Coast. People say it's the best of the Jumbo restaurants, not as touristy as the outlets downtown. The location is nice, with a view towards the water. But what makes this place is the Chili Crab. It's the complete procedure, the way to eat it. I love their Chili Crab, it's actually one of the reasons why I return to Singapore
4
A colleague living in Singapore took me to dinner here as it is one of the best known seafood restuarants in Singapore. The location is out of the way from downtown but taxis are cheap. The location is right by the water so the views are good. We had a mix of dishes. We tried both the Chili crab and the Black Pepper crab, much preferring the Black Pepper crab. The Chill crab is a lot "messier" and much more "work" to eat. I also preferred the flavour of the Black Pepper crab. We also tried the deep-fried baby squid (not a taste for everyone), razor clams and scallops on tarot. Overall the food was very good, although I would not call it outstanding

For a real taste of chilli crab, please do NOT visit Jumbos. They are a cheap brand, with overpriced crab, and is not the best in Singapore beside them showing awards (from 2006??????????) Please do not pay $90USDfor a 1kg crab (since their prices exclude GST and service charges another 19% additional cost) , Honestly, it is cheaper and far tastier at a 5 star hotel like the Hyatt. Also, Jumbos makes you take a ticket and wait in line (literally) to get in?! And once you do get a table, they put a time limit on you so you cant enjoy yourself or your expensive dish. PLEASE AVOID THIS TOURIST TRAP OF A CHAIN RESTUARANT

We got a seat by the river and it began drizzling. Instead of getting a new place inside the restaurant, the staff asked us to line up again if we wanted a place inside. What is even worst is that the waiter recommended Alaskan crab but we got Sri Lankan crab. Instead of an apology, the staff said that the Alaskan crab took a longer time to cook. Finally he took the crab back and had us waited for the Alaskan crab. We were angry being forced to wait and then having to eat under the drizzling rain. Bad service and over priced food

Before visiting Singapore, everyone recommended us Jumbo Seafood at East Coast. We read couple of reviews and even some of the people were not very satisfied, we decided to make our own opinion. As it was at the beginning of December, we made a reservation by email from the Czech Republic in advance. It was confirmed within 1 day. Although we came 30 minutes later and the restaurant was completely FULL, they gave us a table in a minute. The place have a great atmosphere, open air eating, hundreds of people, the sea next to the restaurant... we really enjoyed it. We ordered abalons, bamboo clams, steamed fish and of course chilli crab. Staff had very basic English but we did not have any difficulties to make the order. All the meals were absolutely delicious. I can't forget hot buns, which were served with a crab - yummy. After all, we decided to have a dessert - some mango/coconut thing, again very good. We paid about 180 dollars for the whole dinner (including beers). It was one of our best dinners we've had in Singapore and we will definitely come again

Just showed up and was lucky to get in without booking. Had to be finished by a certain time though. Nice to eat outside. Shared a 1kg crab for $58SGD. Thankfully they give you a bib. Staff cleaned up crab shell very quickly. Rated 6/10

Yes it is a bit expensive and yes the service is average at times, but you can not beat it!It was our first night in Singapore and decided to visit the East Coast Seafood Centre. With all the other restaurants around, Jumbo Seafood stood out as the most popular with a well set up reservations system at the entrance.We ordered Cereal Prawns, Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab, a handful of Tiger beers, coming to $190SGD.It was so delicious I am craving it two weeks later! My fave is the Chilli Crab. Do yourself a favour and go

Went today for lunch. Wonderful chilli crab which was the highlight among all dishes. Very well cokked with excellent sauce.The buns accompanying crab were fresh. Seafod fried rice was very tasty as so was steamed fish. Crispy squid was also great.Good prompt service with waiters changing our plates frequently.Overall very good value for money, good place to visit with family

Just landed in Singapore late this afternoon staying in Clarke quay area. Didn't get chance to check the reviews so decided to try our luck but it turned out rubbish! Food itself was average, except for the prawn/seafood fried rice as it was utterly tasteless!! Together with service and price I would have to say it was poor! Had to wait ages for the dishes during which loads waiters and waitresses came to check our order list on the table. It cost us nearly 200 sin dollars which was 100 quid! It turned out that they charge u for the tasteless tea and peanut which they didn't even ask whether we wanted them or not at the first place. Plus 10% service charge which seem so pathetic as otherwise I don't think many people would bother. It was getting worse towards the end as we had to wait over 10 min for our credit card to come back. It was handed over from one waiter to the other to make the bloody payment! Considering this is the first day of my first time in SG I'll have to say it was not a good start!!! :((

Although pricey, you will not regret getting the traditional crab dishes at Jumbo. The crabs are BIG and juicy. A must-go if you're looking to try the Singaporean-style crabs! You have to make a reservation and they will kick you out after 1.5 hours so order quickly and you can enjoy the food

I had heard that one have to eat chilicrab in Singapore and Jubo was the place to it eat. And we were not disappointed. The food and wine were great, and Chilicrab really is a must in Singapore, and the staff was helpfull. Unfortunately there were no available tables outside when we arrive and it was slightly cold indoors. Besides this, the restaurant is definitely worth a visit
3
Over rated, over priced, poor service. Full credit to their PR machine though, they have most visitors and many locals believing it is THE place to eat. The one redeeming feature is that you can buy the chilli and pepper sauce mixes so you can make your own at home.There are better, less expensive options for the classic Singapore Pepper and Chilli crab like Long Beach or CFJ. As around and ignore the hype
5
When I told my friends the first thing I wanted was to eat Seafood when I landed in Singapore, they said we were going to Jumbo! I needed to have Chilli Crab right there and then! We ordered a few side dishes and Chilli Crab was served right at the end with some steamed Man Tou (buns). Mmmmm.. delicious! I regretted eating all the other dishes prior to the Chilli Crab but I stuffed myself as much as I could! Definitely would go back for more
1
After eating our way through Thailand and Vietnam we were eating for the last time in Singapore before leaving for Malaysia! Jumbo seafood has to be my family and I's worst restaurant we have ever experienced!The service was abousetly disgusting not being regularly served, minimal English from staff, when asking questions being cut off, when service would approach us were treated like dirt and being shifty by supposedly offering free nuts and tea but being charged.The food was average and my sister waited after everyone had eaten for 6 prawns which took an hour but should have come first. The name of the restaurant and price was extremely over rated.When going to pay were surrounded by staff as we counted the moneySeriously worst staff and ordinary restaurant that's not worth the pric

This place is very crowded. Once hey seat you there is a sign on the table that tells you what time they need you to be done with your dinner. The allow you an hour or so. So if you want to take in the scene and enjoy a nice dinner forget about it!. We arrived at 6:40 and our time was to be up by 7:45. We ordered the famous chili crab way over priced for 1kilo crab it was 68 SKD or about 55 dollars US. It had so much sauce it was swimming in it! We ordered the sweet rolls because our driver said it was a good way to dip in the sauce and he was right as it cut the chili due to the sweetness of the fried roll. We ordered the Cereal Shrimp (22 SKD or 17 US) those were really good and much better then the chili crab in my opinion. We also ordered the Seafood fried rice( 16 SKD or 13 US) We would of enjoyed just the rice, bread and shrimp and been happy!Oh and by the way they give you peanuts and tea but charge you for that too!Price for 2 people was 168.90 SKD or 140.00 US not worth it
4
My work colleagues from Singapore took me here for dinner and it was great food and service. The chilli and pepper crab were the highlight of the meal and highly recommend the food and the restaurant.
5
Wow...went here to celebrate a work team achievement....wonderful. We arrived in the rain which isn't ideal, but the outdoor covered seating and food made up forget. Both the black pepper and chili crab are worth the visit!

We booked to have dinner at the Riverside Jumbo this evening. On arriving at the restaurant we were told that the restaurant was full and they had no record of the reservation that i made two hours before! They sent us over to the Riverwalk Jumbo, about a 6 minute walk ......in the pouring rain!We arrived with a booking form and presented ourselves to check -in. The lady there yelled, Why are the Riverside Jumbo sending people to us when they know we are full!!! Then she proceeded to start being very ugly in chinese............very unwelcoming to say the least! We hanged around for 15 minutes, finally getting a table. While being seated, the same lady came back to us and stated that we need to hurry up and eat and be out by 7.45pm as the table is booked! We were all taken back, two of us just wanted to walk out and never return........we stayed. We had the chili crab with some other dishes. During the meal, another Jumbo serving statt kept coming over and removing bowls that we were not done with........i asked him, why he was in a hurry? All he said in broken english was...."hurry up, this table is booked".This is totally rude and downright insulting. They are happy to take our money but treat us like crap in the process.......its like, come for dinner but you have to leave by a certain time as we have other people coming.........what the hell is this restaurant coming to? It used to be pretty good, now its just turning tables over...........Jumbo, if you are reading this? You guys really need to pick your game up on service. I hate getting indigestion, especially when i am paying for it!!!Oh, and please? Where have all the fabulous Singaporean staff gone.........all the staff seem to be very rude mainland chinese personnel.......that speak very little to no english

There are many restaurants in Singapore specializing in Chili Crab and Jumbo Seafood is one of them. It is very popular, so better have reservations or be prepared to wait for a long time.Fortunately, the wait is worth it. The big meaty crabs can be had with either chili sauce or black pepper sauce. Our group had the chili sauce, their signature and paired it with fried buns. It was delicious though a bit expensive especially compared to hawker places serving the same item. However, you are sure of consistent quality especially if you're not familiar or can't remember which hawker serves it well. Also, the chili sauce leans towards the sweet side, a little less addictive than Palm Beach or the ultra-expensive No Signboard. Their salted egg prawns and cereal prawns are also worth tasting. Service is quick and efficient

There are multiple Jumbo restaurant, we picked the one in Riverwalk because it is in Clark Quay area and that where we stayed. The Chili Crab was great, full of flavour and not too spicy. We ordered some buns as well to soak up the sauce at the end. The Crab is season price, it costed us about SG$80 for a 900g Crab. I was glad to pick the table inside with air-conditioning . Not sure if I could survive the humidity and temperature! The waiter / waitress were really helpful and able to recommend just enough food for us. The restaurant was a bit noisy and having a group of drunken Japanese next to us didn't help! Sitting outside also poses threat of the sudden rain as well. Booking is essential, we booked a head when we are in Sydney and the system worked great. We arrived just on time and the table is waiting for us

We (always) went to the branch on the East Coast Seafood Center. We love eating seafood by the sea. The place is easy to reach by taxi. The area has several seafood restaurants, but Jumbo seems to be always the most crowded - for a very good reason. On weekends, people are willing to wait for tables for dinner. The place is already quite big and has 2 floors. The best dishes are Chili Crab and Black Pepper Crab. The portion is huge. I would advise you come here with several friends, so you can try different dishes. The drunken prawn is also a favorite. We also like the golden chicken, the bamboo clams, and the vegetables (chinese spinach, kailan, etc.). The baby squid could be chewy and tough. It's moderately pricey, but worth the experience
5
Got land up in the restaurants along with non-veg loving colleagues at Jumbo restaurant yesterday. These restaurant staff coordinated local nearby restaurants and make us available fantastic strictly vegetarian dinner for me. Appreciate service. My seafood lovers has also got the tasteful dinner. Overall good place for food no matter Veg or non- veg

I've done the Chili crab scene for about 10 years now -- but this was my time to Jumbo. Before I aways went near the Merlion across from the Fullterton (and had good food there too) bur wanted to try someplace new since it had been 5 years since I've been made! Last minute in the cab decision -- and Jumbo on the River it was (versus Long Beach on Sentosa ), Glad we did -- the traffic look not great into/outof Sentosa. So we landed at Jumbo -- wait wasn't more than 5 minutes for an outdoor seat (at around 7.30 PM), Service was nice and prompt -- as is the food creation too. In typical style, if you order your whole meal -- than don't expect it to come to in anything other random style. Whatever plate is made and ready to go set gets serverd at its peak. So we did some appetizers like grilled giant shrimp that came after our chili crab,but before the black pepper crab, etc. All in all it was a fine scene I really don't mind having food various tastiness happens at random spots! We had the crabs 2 ways - Chili and Black Pepper. They are both SOOO good and so different.. I love one leading to the other. Of course the Montou we tried both fried and steamed. Slight presence to us for the fried, but only slightly. I enjoyed both types on the chili sauce.We also had an order of the Kai Lan w/ Garlic -- and that was good steady. A nice foil ... The we did other the larger giant prawns BBQ -- each prawn was giant but very very tasty. 1 of the prawns was more than enough to fill us up just right! All in all, a good "crab" outing! Nom Nom
4
chili crab their signature dish, is goooood. little on the pricy side, but if you eat there once in a while, it is worth it. good place for business dinner. after dinner, there are ample place around the riverwalk to down a few whisky to 'digest' your meat intake. haha.
3
We went to this place as recommended by other travelers. Relating the food and price was as expected. Good food, quite expensive, just as we were told. So far I would have rate this place with 4 points, but some weird thing happened here.Just in the middle of the lunch, while still eating the crab, we were asked to pay the check. Not only us, all the tables around, this was very rude and unexpected, it is the first time ever this kind of thing happens to me. The Japanese couple of the table next to us was as surprised as we were. They told us that cashier was closing so the need to have all bills paid. One point less just because they couldnt wait for customers to finish lunch to have the bill paid
5
This is a diamond in the rough!!! Highly recommended - specifically for the crabs, ribs and their cereal shrimps which in my opinion are to die for. Exceptional food!
4
On my second visit, I decided to try out their signature black pepper crab. It was a 900 gram beauty, with just a suggestion of pepper. The meat was succulent, but a bit difficult to get at, even with the shell cracker. Having bee used to the curried chilli crab, the dry pepper crab was a bit of a disappointment. But the restaurant was in no way responsible for my expectations!The accompaniments included ginger-butter asparagus, chicken rice, salted egg golden prawns and mutton and chicken satay. The prawns were heavenly. The mutton satay (which I tasted for the first time,) was a bit tough. Chicken satay was great, although a bit too sweet, when taken with the peanut sauce. Unlike the last time, when we had seats outdoors, this time we decided to go upstairs choosing the air conditioned comfort. Although the place was quite spacious and well-lit, it was no match for the outdoor seating (except when it rains, as it did when we visited).On the whole, the experience was very good. Will come again to taste other options
3
If the day was not so hot, sitting outdoors was not that bad. Watching sexy ladies walking past was not a favorite pastime of mine, but it suffices in killing time while waiting for the dish to be served. The waiters and waitresses were kind and patient enough to wait for our order, and to provide details of individual dishes as well as recommendations. Picking crab flesh from its shell is messy work. Fortunately JUMBO provided each diner with a paper napkin. Despite its name, the pot of chili crab is by no means salsa hot, merely a tad spicy to the Malaysian taste bud. For beginners dining in spicy food, this would be a good start. The fragrance wafting out from the pot is positively mouth-watering, with the egg-filled gravy mixed with chili and assorted spices covering the hard shelled crustaceans beckoning for a bite. If you know how to twist the flesh out from its protective casing that is.Scallops Wrapped in Yam Ring (荔茸干贝) is one of dish in JUMBO which I would recommend. It is really worth the price to try this dish. The number of desserts in JUMBO's menu is quite high, so there is enough for everyone to try something out from the list. Here are but a few of those colorful ones. Some of the desserts are served warm, so it is best to consult the waiter/waitress before placing the order so as not to be surprised by the served item

When in Singapore, you must not miss this place! They serve such an amazing chilli crab, me and my friends went there as often as our budget allowed us. For the record, we're not fans of spicy food, so we ordered our crab only with tomato sauce. But for the pepper lovers, the chilli version's definately worth the try! As a matter of fact, I heard it was ellected the best chilli crab in Singapore. Staff was OK, could be better
4
The Chilli Crab were extremely delicious. I ordered it because my friends gave a lot of compliment and I totally love its taste. As named, this restaurant is a seafood heaven. Specially, the material were so fresh. the restaurant were attracted many customer, but the service were excellent. I didn't wait too long. If you come there in the evening, It is perfect with the combination between excellent meal and nice view.The price were a little high but I think it totally suitable for its quality
3
This is one of a chain of large seafood restuarants. It overlooks the sea in the East Coast park and is a great place for people watching - the view is south towards Indonesia and you'll probably see literally hundreds of tankers at anchor.The service was awful. And they cannot bring the main course and side orders together. I sent the sides back when they got cold and told them I wouldn't pay unles all parts of the meal were delivered together.....a bit draconian but it worked.The food was pretty good and I would eat there again - but it is nothing special. It's a bit pricey too.Also they serve shark's fin soup - this is really worrying that such a large chain of restaurants contributes to such environmentally damaging fishing practice. Shame on Jumbo and if this is a concern then don;t eat here
3
This is one one of the most popular restaurants for chilly crab. My friend took me here. We booked in advance, so that didn't have to wait. The food was good, nothing to exceptional though. But the booking is also time sensitive. Before we finished our plate, the waitress came over and urged is to finish soon as they only reserved an hour or so for each table! That's very efficient, but not super client friendly. But it's good to be here once, to try their most famous chilly crab
5
this is a fun place to get local seafood, down at the waterfront. the chili crab is superb. try some of the local specialties, as the are all very good. quite crowded, but very large place, and very accommodating. make a reservation, as it can be vey busy at peak hours
5
The Chillie Crab at Jumbo is awesome, apparantly from sri Lanka, costs $50 per kilo- a 1kg crab is enough for two people. It is on sea edge , the lights from the hundreds of anchored ships have to be seen. The best crab we have ever had, a truly rewarding exoerience- Oh the other seafood looked just as goo
3
Crowded on a weeknight - call in reservations or be prepared to wait to be seated. The food is pretty good, but far from outstanding. High prices for the portions you get. Lots of groups, with some interesting-looking characters, and you can sit outside and watch people go by on the riverwalk. Service was pretty good, but slow
4
The place is packed of tourists and locals, despite the floor is not so clean, the staff are very efficient. The seafood: black pepper crab, bamboo clam, sautéed egg prawn, all really yummy.
5
excellent black pepper sri lankan mud crabs! must try and the chillis crab's not bad too... have it with other seafood and enjoy the view. after twilight, the light from the ships and tankers on channel looks like city lights
5
The Jumbo restaurant was one of the culinary highlights of our visit to Singapore.Enjoyed, a starter, main course, drinks, fruit plate and Chinese tea all for less than €40.The food is top notch, very tasty and great portions. It is a very busy area so service is prompt and very efficient but don't be expecting a chat.We were there for over 2 hours enjoying the meal and the view.Fab! Will be Back
4
Much more expensive pepper crab than what we'd enjoyed at Jumbo on Dempsey 5 years ago, but very good -- and we've read that crab has been harder to find lately. Tiger draft beer was good (but they give you only a 12 oz glass). Note that if you drink the tea that's poured or eat the peanuts that are on the table, you're charged 2.40 S$ for 2 teas and 1.20 for the peanuts -- not a big deal, but an interesting tactic. Although they didn't close until 1500, a waiter stopped by at 1430 as I was still eating my crab (our res'n was for 1330) and asked me to pay my bill -- another interesting practice. So, I had to stop eating and clean my hands to handle my readers and wallet -- then resume eating and later clean my hands again after I finished. Even though the crab was a bit pricey, after paying what we did to get here and stay here, we weren't going to be deterred by high prices. At least we knew from the last time not to order anything else -- a 1 kg crab is filling. The service was good and friendly, and we ate in the air-conditioned section, so we were comfortable. So, just be prepared for the high price and the annoying charge for the tea and peanuts you didn't order (I suppose you don't have to drink or eat them), and enjoy the wonderful pepper crab with a cold Tiger beer
4
A couple of colleagues took me here and we had a really enjoyable night. This is a place for tourists and they get through a lot of customers but the food is excellent and it's nice to sit outside looking out to sea. Make sure you have the chilli crab but start with a selection of local dishes (there was universal acclamation of the ribs!).
5
The restuarant is located near Boat Quay, and the views are not as good as with other places slightly further where all restaurants are on the embankment. However, if you would like to try crab, this is a better place than several outlets that are more centrally located but maybe out to rip off tourists (like Forum Seafood -- watch out for prices at Forum and always try to cut a deal before ordering, unless you are on an unlimited budget).Jumbo was recommended by the concierge and turned excellent. There are two types of seating -- in the open, on the street (good if you are two or four) but if you go as a larger group, they have large tables inside (some in separate rooms). Excellent chili crab. One of the best in Singapore. Pepper crab is too hot here, and it is best to take chili crab. On one occasion we went as a group of 12, and took sample menu. All foods dishes were very good, but the service for the group was slow. I enjoyed most jelly fish salad, duck, chili crab and fried rice. Fish was also very good. Reasonable choice of wine. They also have a location on the beach on the road to the airport -- I also enjoyed that place, it was bigger though and may be a good alternative if you would like to go slightly further out of the center for a meal. Both places are packed family-type restaurants, and are good for groups or a simple eat, if you like a crowd around and tasty asian food. By no means, not an upscale place for a romantic dinner with champagne
1
There are a few Jumbo Seafood franchises across the island, and we have visited most. Today was the most disappointing experience. Food is still to Jumbo standard but the service was abysmal. We arrived at Jumbo Clarke Quay at around 1:30pm - we were told kitchen closes at 2:30 and restaurant at 3. Ordered at around 1:45., received all orders at 2:15. Slap bang in the middle of eating (seafood is messy) presented with the bill! What the.....? Asked the waiter to come back after we had finished (and closer to 3pm) no luck - register is closing. Was presented with my one and only napkin to wipe my fingers to retrieve my card. Then again, same napkin when I had to sign, in the middle of my lunch. Needless to say, I lost my appetite. Cannot believe this is inthemiddle of a tourist precinct! Will stick to trekking outto eastcoast in future
4
we were 7 and had a reservation and we seated quite quickly. We waited for 3 of the group, and had good enough service....Tiger beer and beef satay and calimari. Only thing is the calimari were not as expected - they were small and crunchy and kinda weird. Then the main event! - chili crabs and pepper crabs. Both were very tasty - my favorite was pepper crab, but definitely the chili crabs sauce you want to scoup up with the little buns they provide. we had plenty of food. When it threatened to rain, staff immediately moved us under shelter, so essentially we had 2 spots and view. would definitely go back. No idea the price
5
It was actually our transfer driver from the airport that told us about Jumbo seafood restaurant after we spoke about eating at KU DE TA. He didn’t deny the quality of the food at KU DE TA but did say we would get the same quality at Jumbo as there and not need a mortgage to pay for it. Late on Saturday night we managed to grab an outdoor table over looking the water.Singapore’s named dish is Chili crab, a full crab cracked and cooked in a sweet and tangy chili sauce. I hadn’t tried that yet so we ordered that as a starter.Delicious is an understatement. I nearly lost a few teeth scraping all the available sauce out of the dish to crunch on bits of shell. It was so good I pretty much ignored my mains to finish off the crab that others had left behind.There were mains but I cant remember any of them. Give me more chili crab! The transfer driver was correct, amazing food and a reasonable bill
4
It was recommended by the local. this place is a little bit out of town but nice location as it's by the bayside. the place was packed with both local & foreiners. The most famous dish was Crabs, actually everything was OK but pricy compare with other Country like Thailand & Malaysia. Service was fast & attentive. the only problem might be the transportation. No MRT going there, you must either use your own car or a cab (which is some what convenient as they were waiting for services). In general, it worth a visi
5
Absolutely delicious!! Jacky Wong was the best 'rock star' waiter.
Good, quick service. Exactly what we needed - so glad we went!
5
By far my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Their chili crab is a must-try, but basically everything there that I have tried so far is delicious. Best to go at night so you can see the beautiful view of Clarke Quay with colorful night lights.

We ordered a salty egg crab and a French-style lobster, and also stir fried vegetables and steamed rice. We were told the crab and lobster would take 30-40 minutes, which was fine with us (the place was very busy, and it was good that they set our expectations). The order was repeated to us, all correct. However 5 minutes later we were served the vegetables on their own. We told the waiter that the vegetables should come out with the rest of the meal. He said he would check if they could but never returned. He continued working, walking past us several times to go and wait on others and prepare tables. After waiting 10 minutes with no response we asked one of the more senior staff and they began making excuses about how they cannot because of how busy they are, but they backed down once we said to simply take the vegetables off our order. The vegetables were taken away but with no clear response as to wether we'd get them back later. Around 40 minutes into our sitting the crab arrived, then the lobster. Both were lovely, although the French style sauce on the lobster largely over-powered the flavour of the meat. Both were very good, although there was no real "wow" factor to the food.15 minutes later a fresh serve of vegetables arrived. Better late than never I guess. Better if they'd simply arrived with the meal (surely this is the most basic of rules for running a restaurant?). Someone asked if I'd like another beer. It never arrived. I had to order again from another person. The rice never arrived (and thankfully wasn't in the bill). So the waitress that took the order never added it I assume, despite reiterating the order for rice twice (we only ordered 4 things, so I don't know how it was missed). Anyway overall the food is good. It cost SG$168 for our food and 2 beers and a watermelon juice. All tasty and filling. Prices were roughly $178/kg for lobster and $56/kg for crab if I remember correctly. I'd have given this restaurant 4/5 if not for the poor service. It's inexcusable for such an established restaurant. But I'd still recommend it. Just be very clear if there's anything even slightly unusual with your order.The restaurant had a busy and happy atmosphere. Hardly a romantic or peaceful setting, but I had no problem with it. Nothing special but nothing wrong with it for us.
3
This was my 2nd time at Jumbo at Riverwalk. Overall impression was nice. Of course, delicious food but still on average from my view. Chili crab may outperform the other dishes. Black pepper crab perhaps not a good choice if you are not so into hot and spicy thing. The rests were on par except vegetable dishes that were not so touchy. Btw, crabs are really big
5
Order an ice cold Singha, a whole chilli crab to share between 2, and a serving of rice....and you are all set for a wondrous meal in Singapore!You can also buy a box of the special, secret chilli paste from the restaurant. It is very well packaged so we bought a few for ourselves and as gifts for friends and family
4
...it is the only way to properly enjoy your chilli or black pepper crab!! There is absolutely no delicate way to do it. They have many other seafood dishes as well if crab is not your thing but the crab is what Jumbos is known for. Decent wine list too. Great service
4
This is Jumbo's flagship and we had a great Chilli Crab there. Service was slow, but understandable. There are many locals which is a good indication of their standard. The only disappointment is their Seafood Hor Fun which was better in Dempsey and Riverside which we visited earlier in the year.Service is expected to be average, but truly a great seafood restaurant
4
I always visit Jumbo's for a chilli crab or black pepper crab and this time we ordered both, along with some seafood stuffed tofu and some stir fried vegetables washed down with a nice Aussie white wine. As usual all the food and service were excellent. There is no getting around fingers covered in the sauces so you will have to get the staff to take the photos. They will then put the camera/phone etc in a plastic bag to avoid splashes!! Always a great meal and experience. Best make a booking as all the outlets are always busy
5
After reading reviews, I made a reservation at Jumbo Seafood Riverpoint in Clarke Quay weeks before I turned up in Singapore. That turned out to be a good move, they were turning away all walkups for the entire weekend I was in SG. Well....we were not disappointed. Ordered both the chili and pepper crabs, and both were fantastic. Service was pretty good, not a problem like I've heard from other reviews, and the view of the river was great. It wasn't exactly a budget meal, but it was sooooo good! Why can't we get this stuff in New York? On a related note, there is a Thai restaurant called Renn Thai right across the river in Clarke Quay that has a very different pepper crab, maybe even better than what Jumbo Seafood has. The people watching is better at Renn Thai, but the rest of the dishes we ordered were meh at best. If you only have two days in Singapore, go to Jumbo Seafood and order both the Chili and Pepper crab, then go over to Renn Thai and order their pepper crab. Then take out a mortgage to pay those 2 bills
4
I think chilly and pepper crap are most famous food of Singapore.So we visit most famous restaurant "Jumbo Seafood".There are several Jumbo Seafood restaurant, and we choose the one at "Riverwalk"We didn't try any other menu but chilly crap and pepper crap.It cost about 65 SDG per one crap. We ordered 2 chilly crap and 2 pepper crap with fried. (It's enough for us, 5)Chilly crap was good, and pepper crap was better. But some of us prefer chilly
3
The service staff have a lousy attitude... They serve you with disdain... The place is very noisy... But the crabs were marvellous.... Beer and Crab ... Yummy... Ignore the service.

difficult to get a seat especially on a saturday night but it was worth the fuss because the food is tremendous!

Not cheap but they r not only famous for their crab, i m glad that they r willing to pay effort to other of their dishes on the list like tofu n cereal prawn. The only thing make me hold bk is the crowd n somehow let their service down .. Too busy especially weekend !

Arriving at Jumbo Seafood Dempsey Hill, we were tired, hungry and a little grumpy. The lack of greeting from the hostess only served to enrage us more. We were given a good table and told we had to be out by 7.30pm, which proved to be plenty of time.After reading many of the reviews from TA, I was very weary of unfounded charges so cunningly I said "no" to the nuts and asked for the price of the Chilli Crab ($56 per kilo and the crabs are approx 1-1.2kg). We ordered steamed rice, greens with garlic, two steamed rolls and two fried and the Chilli Crab! The greens came out straight away, followed by the rice and then 10-15min later our crab. With food in our bellys the mood improved, we had a lovely waitress and when the crab arrived all evils were forgotten, it was well worth the attitude and the expense.

We were recently in Singapore for a business trip, and had a free Saturday night and a taste for chili crab. We ended up at Jumbo as they were one of the few places with same day reservations available. Despite having 6:30pm reservations, we still had to wait 15 minutes to be seated. Pros: the food is actually pretty good, although we liked the black pepper better than the chili crab. The side dishes decent. The location, a few minutes' walk from the Clarke Quay MRT Cons: the service was slow and inattentive, with multiple requests for napkins and water. The seating was very crowded and the table was dirty. We would also add the food is very expensive. There appeared to be many locals dining with us, so it would be only fair to label this a partial tourist trap. In summary, you're likely to have a good meal here, but it is not fine dining despite the steep price

Do NOT eat here without getting black pepper crab. Even though everything else is probably good too. Our table had Wok fried cod in spicy sauce, vegetable delight, chili crab and a cold fish platter all of which were pretty good... the black pepper crab blew them all out of the water! Don't miss out on a treat

I went to this place every single day I was at singapore....they have the best black peppper crab ever! their sugercane prawn is good too....when we entered the restaurant, every table was having atleast one chili crab...thts really famous bt i did not like it. I loved their black pepper crab. Its a lil too pricy...I was surprised when I saw they charges $6 for chinese tea and $8 for peanuts...the way they were serving it- it looked complimentary. When u r paying around $50 per crab, I guess u sorta try not to show u care whr tht $14 went

Been to several jumbo outlets. Enjoyed the food at this outlet most! Ordered 9'dishes and beer at $300 plus. Food is expensive as this place is hardly a restaurant - high class hawker centre! But great hawker ambience and bustling energy downstairs (open air). There is an indoor section on second floor but no lifts which was quite challenging for us as we were dining with 2 elderly and 2 very young children (an active toddler and a sleeping infant in a stroller).Foodwise - This has one of the tastiest and freshest crabs! Ordered both pepper and chili version. Had buns to go along. Enjoyed the crabs but wished there was more gravy for the chilli crab. The gravy was also slightly thick. Other notable dishes included the braised duck which was very tender. Scallop in yam rings which is our family's favorite. Even the mee gorang was tasty and generous with seafood. Nothing to complain about service. Dishes were quickly served and cleared. We were all impressed with the pregnant waitress who were serving our area. She was moving quickly around the tables, balancing the food and herself! Great place to visit if you enjoy eateries with high energy, close tables and great food! However, if you prefer more cosy and classy ambience for seafood, try other jumbo outlets. Also, do lOok out for their $50 vouchers (Sometimes they would give out on streets, attached to newspaper or credit cards). Highly recommend you to get hold of one of those before dining here :

My wife and I went to Jumbo since it's a Singapore institution that "can't be missed". We ordered a prawns dish and seafood noodles. Unfortunately both dishes were poorly prepared and the prawn dish was simply to disgusting to finish. We have had this kind of food many times before and are not new to the cuisine. Anyhow, we explained the problem to the staff who explained that this is gow it is supposed to be. I don't think so. Next problem - there were peanuts on the table when we arrived and someone poured us tea without asking us if we wanted any. When we received the bill we noticed that they had charged for the peanuts and the tea! It's not the money - it's just the principle. Combine crappy food, poor service, rude staff, overpriced food and you end up woth a rating that really should be zero points - but I have to give one, so that is what it gets. Don't go here!!

We were seeing my son(lived there for 9 years) in Singapore and he suggested this restaurant for dinner. Accpeted the offer even though in tourist area. It is known for it's chilli crab dish. It is packed out so we wait for a table to be available for 8 of us. Wait not long as they have a system. We are seated at 8:00pm and have until 9:15pm to complete dinner. This is one busy place you be certain of that.There were a number of dishes ordered including Chilli Crab(I could not eat it), steamed whole snapper, Torfu Vegan Dish, vegetables etc.(about 7 disches and drinks.The steams snapper was amazing with the taste of garlic. in fact the other dishes were great.Would recommend to anybody as a group of people. Not sure 2 people can enjoy all the different tastes that are offered.One thing to be aware of. When ordering the steamed whole fish be aware of pricing and ask what is the price for each. The snapper was 50% less in price than the grouper that day and still tasted amazing. Also the prices are provided in KG or 100gms so be alert on this one. All fish indicated "todays market price"
4
The price is not high and the food taste good. there is also a variety menu items to select from.
The service is also not bad, although they take a while to get my bill.
5
When we arrive at about 6:30pm and the place is already busy and by 7:30pm the restaurant is jam-packed with mostly locals with their family so it really says a lot about the food. Other guests were not willing to wait for their table so they just went to other nearby restaurants. We ordered chili crab, steamed prawns, satay, mee goreng etc. and they are all delicious. The Thai coconut juice and beer to wash them all down are perfect. Despite of the very busy restaurant, the staff are on their toes and they are the ones who even put our bibs so our clothes would not be stained from the sauces of our food. The food what a little bit pricey but what do you expect with seafood and they were all imported from various continent like Australia, Asia and North America. What I like about this branch of Jumbo aside from it is their main branch is the location that you could just stroll along the baywalk after a heavy dinner
5
I just love the meat crab and oat prawn. Not too many place in Singapore offered good seafood. Compared to the "no signboard", Jumbo is a definitely better choice. Though there are lots of Jumbo shops, Clarke Quay is better than elsewhere. I had a crab, small size prawn and a large size stir-fry veggie with a friend. It costs around S$120 something and I do suggest it is fair price. Of coz, you can always find somewhere cheaper but not for a 2 catty crab and great cook in Jumbo.Highly recommended

We didn't book a table so we had to share a big table with another 2 groups.Then shared a rude waitress too :( We ordered chilli crab and a bowl of rice straight away, we were happy with our meal came out so quick, after like less than 10 mins, it was delicious. My husband doesn't eat much seafood so I actually enjoyed most of it by myself. We ordered some roasted pork and stir fry veggies and they were average. We weren't happy with the bill though. $60 for just the crab. Wow. We told our friends - live in Singapore and they were totally shocked with that expensive crab. They said next time go to East Coast as it's a bit further away but way cheaper because here is more for tourists. Well good to try but will never come back

Went on Sept 4 with my husband & a work colleague, all 3 of us from New Zealand. Managed to make a booking by phone earlier in the day,and were duly seated on time. It was busy, the atmosphere casual and the early service a little slow, but loved the chilli crab, and the black pepper crab even more and tried sauteed geoduck. We enjoyed our meal and ticked off a "must-do" Singapore experienc

Not sure what all the fuss is about! You can get better quality food at a much better price from any of the hawker centres. We ordered 3 small dishes, 1 entree and a drink and it came to $110... Scallops in xo, cod in house sauce, crispy squid and sugarcane prawns- all small serving sizes. We were made to sit next to strangers and we were splashed by their chilli crab as they were slurping and sucking away! YUCK!Service staff were rude and arrogant and we were made to wait 15mins just for our change!!The crispy squid was like eating burnt old bones! I am a food lover, rarely do I have hard feelings when my stomach is full. After this experience I felt both robbed and hungry!

no wonder almost every table at this restaurant got chili crab. the national dish here.I always try new places for chili crab. Jumbo is one of the best. The service is top.one interesting tip: Just mention you got the membership card but you forgot it. if you say it right to the waiter you will get 10% discount straight on your bill
1
Got here and were offered a table in a back corner next to the toilets and were told we had to be out in an hour. Given that the price is the same no matter where you sit or how long you stay, we decided to leave. Went to indoChine across the river and were very well looked after.
2
All the waitress were sooooooooo rude!!We were escort to our table together with our people. a Couple of chinese and a couple of korean.We had the famous chili crab.. some of the dishes on the menu were not available.The korean couple ordered the chili crab as well at the same time. They received it after 10 min, we had to wait almost 1 hour!! no one was taking care about us.Really an horrible place to have a meal!! Stay away from it! There are better choices in Singapore!

We came here on recommendation from a friend to try the infamous chilli crab that everyone's raving about but was I disappointed.We ordered 1 chilli crab to share and a small bowl of rice for my vegan friend and the waitress looked notably annoyed that that was all that we were ordering, i'm sure it's our right to decide how much food we want to order especially when the price is high. We then asked if the crab came with the dough balls about 3 times and were not given a simple yes or no answer even if she didn't speak good English i'm pretty sure she would have understood as this restaurant seems to be popular with chilli crab and what people order with it. Anyhoo the crab came out and it didn't exactly blow me away, it was just ok, although I was a bit annoyed that they scraped all the body meat out and shredded it in the soup/sauce where the dough balls would have come in handy. To add further annoyance the waitress charged us for the peanuts that we didn't touch and were already on the table when we sat down, although it was only 60p we were so unimpressed with the waitress being rude that my friend confronted her and asked for a reasoning why we were charged when we didn't order. She then got all huffy and changed the bill then proceeded to talk rudely of us in Cantonese which I understood a bit of but not confident enough to speak it.All in all the place is not worth the money or waiting in line for, if you go round the corner you will loads of seafood eateries with many serving cheaper chilli crab and loads of different varieties as well

This time took the family of 4 adults and 4 kids so we were able to choose lots of food. Everything was great, drunken prawns, tofu in some sort of sauce, excellent pork spare rib dish, seafood fried rice, everyone enjoyed the Chilli Crab and I polished off the better half of a Pepper Crab which I had not had before. Great scallop dish as well and the kids were happy with a Sweet and Sour Pork. Hopefully you can get an outside placed table and it was amazing to see some of the staff that have now been there for the last 15+ years I have been going there. For me it was as reliable as ever, but I know what I am going to get when I get there, so that helps.Will be returning on my next visit April 2014 for my usual fix.Lozzie6

Nothing to write home about. Not quite bad enough to be truly awful, but in some respects that's more damning, because I didn't even feel strongly enough to hate it! We got there around 9-ish and it was pretty busy, we had to share a table (not a problem). The food was ok (chilli crab, prawn sticks and spicy cod) but relatively expensive and there was little love evidenced in any of the dishes. Service was sloppy and inattentive. All in all, I got an impression of complacency and indifference - a place trading on a passing trade. Adequate but no more, and in a city with so many dining options, why go back to somewhere that doesn't care

I have been to Jumbo quite a few times now. Reviews on the site are mixed, and I think it may be incorrect expectations.This is a place frequented by locals at least as much as (probably more than) tourists, so definitely not a tourist trap. It is not even close to luxurious - you come here for very fresh seafood, and should expect slightly brusque service.It is by far best to come in a group if you can, as seafood really is for sharing. My personal favourite is Black Pepper crab - even if Chilli crab is more famous.They also do great fresh fish - but be sure to order it cooked exactly as you want it (I like the Teochew style fish myself)Beware that if you leave around closing time, you may have a long wait for a taxi if you didn't pre book. There are usually maxi cabs available, but these are a pretty expensive option unless you are in a large group and going quite a long way
5
Jumbo seafood outlets offers a very good crab experience the Singapore style.fried in a rich chili sauce or a fiery black pepper sauce both options are great.order also: seafood fried rice. plenty of fried buns, dry chili prawns and mango or honey due melon sago
5
Amazing sea food, whether it is the Sri Lankan mud crabs cooked in chilli gravy the unique Singapore style or it is the drunken prawns or the bamboo clams. The taste lingers on.. I have been to the restaurant at their seafood center on East Coast road several times. It has never failed to be a gastronomic experience. I like this outlet as it is next to sea and in the late clear evening you see the lights of the boats bobbing up and down in the harbour. Their service is excellent! The portions are generous. Best place to get quality seafood in Singapore
5
My husband and I ate the Riverside Point location, across from Clarke Quay. We didn't have a reservation but arrived around 9 pm, the restaurant was still packed! We happen to arrive at the right moment because a table opened up right on the water. The view was great and so was the atmosphere.We shared one order of chili crab, garlic broccoli and a few orders of mantou dumplings (its like a fried roll) to soak up the chili sauce. It was more then enough food, the portions were large. It was one of the best meals I ever had!! Be warned it gets messy but they give a bib to wear and water bowl to wash your hands. This is a must eat when in Singapore, do not miss

Jumbo Seafood is one of my family favorite restaurant in Singapore. Well known for their Best Singapore Chili Crab, Jumbo Seafood also serve other scrumptious seafood dishes, such as Crispy Baby Squids, Salted Egg Golden Prawns, and so much more..If you love seafood make sure to drop by at Jumbo Seafood. For sure, your Singapore experience will not be completed if you miss this one ;

What a wonderful sea side open restaurant! Just great with delicious food and nice weather. The taste of the yummy sea food dishes lingered on the mouth for long time.The Crab, the Cod fish, the big sea fish,all were excellently prepared and served. I liked the 'small apron' on us to eat the crabs at ease.The name Jumbo was appropriate for the food it served.The place was full with visitors on Sunday evening. The lovely pleasant breeze from the sea was perfect for such an outside dinner. A slow walk on the sea side at night was just ideal after the delicious meal. Though the price of the meals were a bit on the high side, but it was worth every penny

Had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the food. My niece was back on a visit with her hubby and new born and was yearning for chilli crab. We decided to go to Jumbo Seafood and had no regrets! We were even offered disposable aprons... :DIt was a superb meal where my niece ordered all the dishes that she had missed over the last few months:- frog leg, sharks fin, sambal kang kong, baby kai lan, chilli crab, black pepper crab, cereal prawn... Her hubby ordered the fried rice and stuffed bean curd.Dish after dish came and everything was super yummy. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal there. The chilli crab goes very well with the deep fried buns (man tou) that you can order separately. The only qualm that we had was that certain parts of the crab claw was very difficult to access as it had not been well cracked. Depending on the dishes that you order, the price can vary quite a bit.Service was great overall! When the staff saw us ladies having our handbags on our laps, they offered to put it on another chair or behind us and used a special chair cover to cover the seat and the bag. What a great idea! The staff even recommended us to apply for the membership card and explained its benefits. Even though we were there mid-week, the restaurant was quite fully packed. Thus if you are intending to go over the weekend or on a Friday evening, would suggest that you call and make a reservation
5
We booked an early sitting and when we arrived the restaurant was already full. We did skip the hour long line that happened later in the evening. The chilli crab took 45 minutes but we were warned of this on arrival. It was definitely worth the wait though and was reasonably priced. For photos see www.ennvy.blogspot.com

this place was explained to me by my SG friends as a tourist spot which a big pricetag and regardless some decent chilli crab and pepper crab. at about $50+ a pop they were good, perhaps pricey but a good experience.
5
Expensive but worth it. 1.1 kg crab $98 (but would probably feed 2 as a main). You need to book as they seem to be booked out every night and everyone is eating crab. Have to go back if only to eat at Jumbos again!
4
Our last visit to jumbo seafood restaurant was when we had visitors from Sydney. We had the regular Chilli Crab, pepper crab etc so our visitors could relish the local delicacies. The food was delicious as always, the service was good however took a bit longer to arrive than expected. Overall a good meal with great friend
4
We went to the outlet at the East Coast Seafood Centre. We had chilli crab (.9 kg), small fried prawns, 2 beers, and a mineral water. The service was very efficient and pleasant. Food quality was good. The crab was a fun meal necessitating some less than elegant eating methods and sounds, but everyone was in the same boat. I'd recommend this place to others, but I probably would see the crab thing as a one-off experience for me. Other seafood dishes at other tables looked good, fish, squid, clams etc.Our bill was $S112 which is not cheap, but I think you could eat well here more economically if you avoided the big ticket items e.g. Crab, lobster
1
As per my head line the crab was to say the least rubbish, and when you have to pay for bread I THINKS THIS IS A BIT MUCH Mr Jumbo. It would serve you better if you though about putting more on the plate and not trying to squeeze the last Dollar out of the un witting tourists by charging ridiculous price for a simple dish like crab and then wanting to charge for bread.Apparently in Singapore 90% of the population speak English so you Mr Jumbo must employ the other 10%
4
If you are going to Singapore you have to go jumbo seafood. We got there a bit late 930 and the place was full an the waiting time was huge. So we waited and the staff are always helpful. And are always trying to get everyone in. They asked us if we would be will to share a table with other customers so we could get in earlier. So we share a table with 5 other people. The food was excellent. Highly recommend if you love seafood. The prices are very good. We had chilli crab, king prawns, noodles etc and was only about 100 Singapore dollars. Anywhere else you would pay a few hundred dollar

We had a reservist buddy get-together at the Jumbo Seafood at Riverwalk back in June. We had earlier tried to reserve a table at the other nearby outlet The Riverside (for its better view) but it was fully booked so we turn to this unit instead. We ordered cold dish (with its delightful sliced duck, prawn salad and jellyfish), cereal prawn + a few more dishes. We tried both the pepper and chilli crab, not quite a crab fiesta but definitely signature dishes here! Both dishes’ sauce was ‘fiery’ but not overly demanding, the taste of crab still distinctive. (we still prefer the black pepper crab..). Did not try the dessert as we were all filled-up.The service is ok and surprisingly the staff can take some of out ‘teasing’, we being quite a boisterous group. Food servicing time is reasonable and the ambience good.While the food quality and quantity is ok it comes with a rather high price tag, each of us paid slightly more than S$60 (without any beer to go). Personally I have found better value for similar dishes in other Seafood Restaurants, both nearby and in the Eastern regio
4
I have been here a couple of times, and I am more of a fan of the black pepper crab more than the chilli crab. They give you these peanuts and chilli sauce to dip it in while you wait for your meal, and make sure you order the bread rolls to wash down the sauce. They are like little savoury dohnuts. It's a very busy place but the view over the harbour is nice and it is definitely an experience
1
Went here latish and had to share a table which we did not mind. Peanuts on the table, glasses etc. They offered a tea which we didn't have and removed the water glasses.Ordered two Tigers and a glass of house white. Also ordered chilli crab for 3 plus 3 bowls of steamed rice. Took them ages to actually take our order and as it was late the staff were not in a happy frame of mind. They were cleaning up the tables around us. They happily put the bibs on the Chinese family sharing our table ( they ordered the pepper crab), but left us to put on our own bibs. We weren't actually waiting for them to do so but it was a glaring omission on their part. The house white arrive and it was half a wine glass. We asked what happened to the rest of it and they told us that was the serving size. It then turned out they had not served the house white (which was priced at $10.50) and served the more expensive white at $16.50. We were incredulous at half a glass for $16.50.The chilli crab was ok but not outstanding.Our bill had the tiny bowl of peanuts on it, 6 bowls of rice ( we had 3), chillicrab and drinks. Came to just under $100 for a very disappointing meal. Heaven knows how much more had we had the jug of water or the tea! Jumbos ...never again
3
Need to book or reserve a table. The staff needs to advise diners that tea and peanuts placed on the table costs $1.20 each. What a way to make money. Imagine how much they'd make a day given they probably have ~1000 diners or so. However their chilli crab is pretty good. As previous reviewers mentioned the crab is pre-cooked and the sauce is poured over the top and tossed through which costs around $56/crab.
5
I'll dream about the Chilli Crabs at Jumbo. We also had the prawns in creamy lemon sauce which were also to die for. It's a touristy atmosphere, but the food more than makes up for it.
1
I know the seafood is not the best but not as bad as it got lately. The poached shrimp was tasteless. The chili crab was pre-cooked poured over with sweet sauce.......where are the good old days anymore!
3
Not bad i went there with my Korean friends food was just okay not so bad but for me it was not much different as just hawker center food . just place was nice!!
4
This large restaurant is like seafood factory, where big plates of shrimps, prawns and crabs appear in an endless stream. The location is great, right by the sea, in East Coast Park. The place is usually packed, with an eclectic mix of locals and tourists. The black peppar crab was great, as was the cod, but the prawns were only OK. With a few cold Tiger beers and terrific people watching, it is still a very enjoyable place to be
4
This is a bit of a drive from Singapore downtown, so you'll need a cab as the train doesn't go there. But I would say that it's worth it to watch the sunset on the oceanfront. There are quite a few restaurants in the East Coast Seafood Centre but only Jumbo and one other place have an oceanfront view. Jumbo is a huge restaurant with tons of tables to seat large parties. We didn't have a reservation but we were seated immediately with 7 in our party.We thought the staff was a bit brief and rude. Our first waitress took 5 drink orders and then left before the last two in our party could speak. We ended up getting another waitress, who seemed to be more senior.We had 6 people and tried to order 3 chili crabs (also had some battered prawns, fried rice and baby kailan) but the waitress told us that was too much and we should get 2. I think she undersold us a little bit because, the way it worked out, we each got one jumbo claw or one crab body. Not much if you love eating crab! At $56 each, you don't want to over order though. I've heard that there are many places in Singapore that sell Chilli Crab for half that price, but as a tourist they aren't as easy to find.A tip: if you are a crab lover and don't mind getting your hands messy, you should order one chili crab for yourself

Living in Singapore, all you hear about it the hyped delicacy known as Singapore Chilli Crab. We thought we would try it, during our visit to Jumbo’s. The restaurant offers two type “Chilli Crab” and “Black Pepper Crab”, and we had both. The Chilli Crab is awful, a mouthful of hot spice that cancels out any hint of the taste of sweet crab meat, and the powerful heat destroys the taste buds for the remaining meal. The Black Pepper Crab is also pretty spicy, but at least you can kind of still taste the delicate flavor of the crab meat. Jumbo’s definitely does not know how to properly add spicy heat to seafood, without ruining the integrity and quality of the actual seafood. The fried prawn with cereal has the potential for tasting amazing, however, you have to hunt through a plate of cereal to find the prawn, which are over cooked, the cereal makes the dish even drier, and a bit overly sweet in flavor. On a positive note, the Bamboo Clams with Minced Garlic, and Fried Rice were delicious. The atmosphere of this restaurant is similar to that of a cafeteria, so definitely not the environment for a romantic dinner. The tables are very close together, which contributes to a congested feel and it does become a bit loud since everyone is sitting so close—the conversations all meld together. In addition, the staff is not very attentive. Jumbo’s is a bit expensive when you compare it to the quality of the food you wind up getting. Formal Prices for underwhelming food in a less than casual atmospher

Jumbo Seafood – Your Ultimate Destination for Chilli Crabs!Asia, Asian, Food, Food Review, Restaurant, Restaurant Review, Singapore August 1, 2013 Comments: 2ApronJumbo SeafoodI come from Mumbai, India… where seafood is not really a delicacy, but a staple diet! Fresh prawns, fish, crabs, etc. are quite easily available. And when you have an amazing cook right at home, venturing out to restaurants to enjoy seafood is a rarity. In fact, I have always maintained that I have had the best seafood right in my mom’s kitchen. That was until mom faced some strong competition… from Jumbo seafood, and that’s saying a lot. Therefore, if there is one restaurant in Singapore I have taken every single of my visitors’ to, irrespective of their nationalities, food preferences or cultural backgrounds, it has to be Jumbo Seafood.Having said that, let’s turn straight to the menu. You can find pretty much any fish or shellfish on the menu, cooked in local Singaporean or Hong Kong style. Here’s my pick of the most interesting and signature dishes, you just cannot miss.Drinks: Skip everything else and go straight for Thai fresh coconut! Starters: Baked prawns in cheese! Yummm... they come as per piece rateMain course: Chili Crabs, fried buns, and pepper lobster! Dessert: Mango pudding, if you still have space!! Reserve a table... you will not get walkin space on weekends and weekday dinners for sure! For indept information on what all you should order, the taste etc... visit my blog: http://spicerover.wordpress.com/2013/08/01/jumbo-seafood-your-ultimate-destination-for-chilli-crabs

We were taken there by some friends and coincidently we had already seen on a plane magazine and felt curious about trying it.Our friends ordered a spicy crab, some fried shrimps with some cookie crumbs on top of them, very unusual, but tasty. Can't remember more, but I can say it was an open place where we sat outdoors and it was busy. If they hadn't made reservation, I think we wouldn't have the chance to get a table.

This is the place for family, overseas visitors and business associates. It is because of the Chilli crab sauce taste, the proximity to the beach, the airport and the friendliness of the staff. We visit this often as family celebration gathering ( usually reserved in advance), the children love the mantou ( fried plain bun dipped in the chilli crab sauce). You can even bring a cake to celebrate a birthday and they gladly store it for you till the call for it. Drunken prawns is one of my favourite but it may not be for the faint hearted. Some of my western business associate cannot take it at all. A must go among all the Jumbo, this is the best

We tasted Jumbo at east coast on out last day in Singapore. No complaint for the food and the crab (both Chili crab and black pepper crab) are really tasty. Friend paid for the dinner so I did not know the price and value for the restaurant. One thing really made me surprised was the restaurant bathroom does not have a flash toilet which is really annoying if you have a kid or on wheelchair. We had the dinner on Friday night and it was crazy busy and hard to find taxis
5
We came here twice on our three night visit to Singapore and the food was amazing, a little pricy but definately worth the money for what you get. Best Chilli Crab in Singapore a must when visiting Singapore!!
3
While the restaurant was nice, I was expecting more after reading the good reviews online, so I left a bit disappointed. The chilli mud crab was nice, not great, and quite expensive, though it is generally an expensive dish in Singapore. Would I go back? Probably not..
5
Excellent value for crab with what you get. We have a black pepper crab for S$75 which we consider excellent value. Service is good and although its always full and hard to get a table, they manage to keep a warm and smiling face.We can only book a table at 9pm three days in advance.Other food is good also but we should not expect too much since the main attraction is the crab.No Sign Board is a total different bad experience. We will never return there
4
Dined here with my friends from Johor Bahru on the 17/7/13. The meal was quite good & they accommodated us without making a booking. We had Pepper crab, deep fried talipia, noodles & prawn dishes. Total bill with drinks for the six of us was just under SIN$200

Chilli Crab is considered a “must try food” when you are in Singapore. It gets messy while you are eating it, so be prepared. The crabs were delicious and so were all the other dishes. The place is very busy and loud. The staff was friendly and attentive
3
We tried this restaurant after reading so many good reviews about it.Food was ok, but i can't understand why people love the chili crab so much.With the price tag, i must say it doesnt live up my expectation.Would i return to this restaurant again? A big n

My family and I have been a regular at Jumbo Seafood @ East Coast Seafood Centre for many years, and I still have regular cravings for their pepper crab! The very long lines, and travelers with luggage before leaving Singapore or having just landed, are testament to the restaurants popularity and amazing food. Their chilli crab may be more famous but I simply love the spiciness and creaminess of the pepper sauce, which permeates into every crook and cranny of the crab, and is well absorbed into the succulent flesh of the crab. We usually order two crabs for a party of 4! We also would usually order the drunken live prawns. The prawns are juicy and tender, and the herbal stock tasty. As side dishes, I like the fried dough fritters stuffed with squid pulp, the scallop yam rings and satay too

I had been wanting to try the dish Chilli Crab and was advised that Jumbo Seafood on the East Coast Parkway was the best. Not much ambience upstairs but full of other diners many also taking on the signature dish. The taste is great but it a lot of hard work to get the meat out of the shell. Worth the effort though but go for the Black Pepper Crab if you don't like the ensuing mess as I used up many napkins to clean my hands

Was in Singapore for company meeting for couple days, and went out for dinner with my colleagues from Hong Kong, China & Japan. We always love to dine in local restaurant to sample great Singaporean cuisine ... Hainan chicken, Laksa, chili / black pepper crab etc.Due to late arrival, we asked hotel concierge as what good restaurant nearby for late dinner of 5 people, Jumbo Seafood at Riverside Walk was recommended. No advance reservation was allowed, we had to go there directly and queue in the line.Luckily, it wasn't too long to wait for a table for 5 ... 15 minutes :-) We ordered a set dinner menu with lobster, chili crab, vegetable, steamed fish, fired rice etc, it cost S$500 for food & beverage. Both lobster & crab dishes were perfectly cooked and all of us couldn't resist in licking our fingers ... The fired rice was the best I ever had in my life, and I had small bowls of rice (which I shouldn't have so much for late dinner).Service was great and attentive, and we all enjoyed our meal there which was the best one for our short 3 days stay in Singapore.Will surely visit again on my next trip

For an excellent meal of crabs, shrimps or fish, this is the place to go in Singapore. The waterside restaurant offers a good view with ships across the bay. The outdoor seating is recommended, specially in the evening. The crab dishes are the speciality. One can buy and take away their mix to make crab at home from the restaurant. I liked their pepper crab and pepper beef with plain white rice the best
5
The seafood dishes never fails to impress. Likewise the prices. Good place to entertain your customer and impress them with local seafood. Chilli crabs are one of the best and must order dishes.
4
Singapore food-to-eat checklist includes black pepper crabs. Craving satisfied here at Jumbo. Spicy with a kick! Yummy cereal prawns too. You should reserve ahead of time since the resto is always full. Good thing we came early for dinner around 530pm with no reservation.
4
Chilli Crab at Jumbo is definitely a delicacy, a must try but at the same time butter-baked king prawns were awesome too. Courteous service. The value for money comes from the taste of food at Jumbo. If around Clark-Quay, please do not miss this one.
2
Portions are small and tastes blend for most of the dishes - not a bad Asian food restaurant but I will not come again for Singaporean seafood
5
If you are in Singapore with a zest for Seafood then don't think further, just goto Jumbo Seafood in East Coast road. Buzzing with people all around the complex with several restaurants around, this one holds it's place. You can have Sri Lankan Crabs as big as 3 or 4 Kg ones. It's simple, you choose the Crab, choice of Sauce and there it is. I had it in both the Pepper Fry and the iconic Chilli Crab sauce. There are a lot of options available from Squids to Shrimps.Great Ambiance, Open Air and impeccable service
4
Dined here with my family and all I can say was the sweet and sour deshelled prawns were probably the best dish I've ordered in singapore and the black pepper crab is a must! The sauce was incredible fiery and exactly what I need with the juicy flesh inside. If you go here you must get the peppercorn crab, you will not be disappointed. Service could be better but nothing drastically wrong. Beautiful riverside setting though :
5
My fiancÃ© and I decided to go to Jumbos after reading reviews online and both of us wanting to try Black Pepper Crab. We went without a reservation on a Sunday night at around 9pm, we were told we would have to wait and share a table with others which was not a problem. After waiting for literally 3 minutes, we were taken to a large round table with two other couples, however we were spaced out around the table so it didn't feel like you were eating with others. We ordered black pepper crab, baby Kai Lan with Garlic and both steamed and fried buns, along with margaritas and long island iced tea. It was absolutely amazing - the crab was so peppery and tender, the Kai Lan was so tasty and the cocktails were amazing. It is rather expensive, but it was worth it - so much so that we also sound up there the following night and ordered an identical meal again (this time sitting outside at out own table, which was just as nice

Jumbo Seafood is known in Singapore as one of the go-to places for seafood dishes especially local delights such as chilli crabs, pepper crabs, cereal prawns and bamboo clams. This is a good place to introduce tourists or visitors to such dishes with a nice view of the East Coast beach shoreline and beyond. They are mostly packed on approaching weekend nights so its best to book online in advance on call directly to the restaurant for a reservation required within 24hrs. Best to go with a group of 6 people onwards as they cater for larger groups, besides you get a better variety of food with more people sharing. They do provide bibs for the messy crabs so not to worry on getting your clothes dirty. As you are eating seafood, the cost is relevant to the dishes. This is not a cheap food court or hawker center prices so expect to fork out about $250-350 for 5 people with chilli crabs, cereal prawns, bamboo crabs, no alcohol and lots of fried buns

I can't believe it!? I have been patronising Jumbo for the last 15 years and must comment that its service level standards have dropped tremendously over the last few years, as it incorporates a high proportion of non-English speaking service staff into its various restaurants. Perhaps, the management has been too focused on expanding into the overseas markets.Food wise: Black pepper and chilli crab and the usual. They ran out of baby squid?!Whilst, my guests seemed pleased with the food, I believe that the experience could have been better
4
ALWAYS bring overseas guests who like Seafood to Jumbo's to try the Sri Lanakan Pepper and Chilli Crab. Roughly 50 / 50 verdict on which one people think is the best. I personally prefer the Pepper Crab but...Service is decent enough and prices are a bit on the high side but overall a worthwhile experience
4
I always go to Jumbo for the pepper crab. I have eaten here about ten times over the years. The pepper crab is always excellent. the other foods are fine too. it has the best location in the East Coast restaurant complex as well.
4
Food was really good! Quick, efficient service. The servers are polite and accurate in delivering one's orders. Cost is reasonable.
1
Food was bad. Seafood was very squishy and they ran out of fish and the food took a long time to com. All in all, very very very bad experience
2
I am not a happy camper. I ate at Jumbo Seafood this afternoon. I got in no problem at the noon hour (early to eat in Singapore). I've never eaten Chili Crab or Black Pepper Crab. Trying one of the two dishes was a must for my trip to Singapore. I asked the waitress what she suggested. At first she didn't understand what I was asking (surprising considering how upscale and touristy the establishment is) and then she told me which dish was more popular. I asked again and she still refused to answer - so I just picked Chili Crab. I also ordered a braised spinach dish with century egg. The spinach came first. I took two bites and did not like it. I moved it to the side. The waitress noted that I wasn't eating it. She didn't clear it away. Nor did she offer to exchange it or refund me the cost. I guess it is my fault for ordering something I shouldn't have but when I am at this pricey of an establishment (my meal came out to $87 Singapore) I am used to some sort of offer to exchange. Overall the customer service was abysmal. I must admit, I really enjoyed the Chili Crab. The sauce was tasty with the right hit of spice. But again the price was high. The menu lists as market price so there is no way to know what you are paying until after the bill. Unfortunately my experience was severely tarnished by poor service. I will never go back to Jumbo or recommend it to others. Find another place to get your chili crab fix
1
The first time I was there I was satisfied. These last couple times, I think the servers actually forgot us. Chilli Crab took 1.5 hours from order to service. Next time, BBQ fish was one hour. On both occasions, the orders went in before the tables started filling. On both occasions, they provide a 10% discount (on food only, not drinks) for our displeasure. The location isn't very nice. You can get as good of food in most locations. My advice, just avoid the place
4
The place is crowded most of the time. We were fortunate to get a table for dinner. Two of us ordered a dish of chili crab, 6 pieces of fried buns and a dish of stir fried spinach. Bill was around SGD90++. Clean environment and service was prompt. Menu is extensive
4
Came here late afternoon and sat outside. It was lovely. Service was slow and they had to ask us a few times what we ordered. A co worker of mine choose 2 different times because they were out of that item. We ordered a bunch of different items and shared it all. Everything did not come out at once and things were still coming after we asked for the check. Would not go agai
5
I must say I am very pleased with my visit to Jumbo Seafood Restaurant. They might command a slight premium value to the average Singaporean Restaurant, but it was thoroughly justified with the dishes they presented. Its Singaporean Chilli Crab also lived up to my expectations.We ordered a set menu for four and priced at S$208. We were happy that none of the dishes were average
5
Thisis a review that I am happy to write.Jumbo is one of several seafood restaurants in the "East Coast Seafood" area, close enough to the airport that you can eat there even during a stop-over in Singapore (I did that once).The food is outstanding, the service is excellent, I sat with a fantastic view of the bay.I recommend this place to anyone loving seafood. It's my favourite restaurant when leaving the city (as mentioned, it's on the way to the airport) or when transiting through Singapore (I keep astounding time margins when I travel ;-
3
We visited this place in the east of Singapore for dinner with the cousins.. The location is far from central Singapore and you need a car to get to the East Coast park. The place is packed on weekends with mostly tourists. It is expensive so be prepared. The food sizes are atrociously small- the chili crab is delicious but very expensive- you can get exactly the same but at half the price in Kuala Lumpur. For a dinner party of five, we ordered chili crabs, bread to go with the crab sauce, BBQ pork ribs, yam with scallop and a baby Kailan vegetable and Chinese tea- the total was SGD135. We found this to be very expensive and we were far from being satisfyingly full because the portions were small.This isn't worth your time, I won't be returning for another visit
5
Been to Jumbo over dozen times, every time I am on a business trip I make the time to eat there. Reservation is a must as its very popular. Chili crab is out of this dynamite!
5
Jumbos chilli crab was great..good value. You must book, very popular and hard to get a walk in table
5
Crab chilli with fried man tou is everyone's fav. The seafood is fresh and the portion is good. Price at Jumbo is considerably fair as compare to other places. East coast park is a all time fav for sea food lovers.
4
Excellent crab, great Phoenix chicken and delicious duck. They even managed to squeeze us in last minute on a packed Saturday night. Hard to beat... Pricey but worth it.
5
The jumbo restaurant at east coast is a must visit destination and please only this joint. I cannot comment about the other Jumbo branches in the city, somehow I always find the food at east coast much better than the other branches. I been visiting and bringing guests to this restaurant for the last 2 decade and enjoyed the place, food, service and pricing every time. But make sure you make a reservation as place gets very very crowded on weekends
3
Food was Okay but the price was TOO much. For the same food in other places in singapore, one can get them in a third of the price. I'm sure there are reasons for high prices and if people still come and will not mind, that's fine. But in my case...no plans to visit thiere again
3
Half the restaurant is undercover the other half is out in the open. We managed to get a table out in the open initially but then we could see a massive thunderstorms coming across. We asked to be shifted inside. The staff tried to help us under difficult circumstances and we moved twice and finally got undercover just as the rain started bucketing down. They roll out some awnings but this doesn't seem to help much. There was no way everybody was going to fit under cover and the people who couldn't find a place under cover watched as their food bowls filled up with rainwater. They supplied disposable raincoats so this is obviously a common occurrence. We had gone there to experience the chilli crab but unfortunately there was way too much chilli for our tastes. As far as I am concerned you could have been eating any sort of soft flesh that was completely masked by the chilli. We are used to catching our own mud crabs at home and cooking them so we can compare. The rest of the food selections were pretty ordinary. Even with the bibs there is still a very good chance of spilling food so don't wear good clothes.Trying to get a cab out of the place back to the hotel is also difficult. Even if you book, people just jump in and grab the cabs and there never seems to be anywhere near enough of them.We can say we have gone to one of the more famous restaurants to try Singapore chilli crab now but wouldn't consider going bac
3
We had to try it whilst in singapore and the hotel staff recommended it. We arrived and were told to come back in an hour (9pm) as it was fully booked at 8pm on a Tuesday night. We were willing to wait for an outdoor table but there wasn't guarantees made. We got lucky and were seated outside. Ordered small chilli crab and BBQ prawns (more than enough!). You must try the mini buns to soak up the sauce. Very messy meal but a must try experience! Wear your bib
4
It was late 9.30pm when we made the spur of the moment decision to see they could find us a table. Alternatively we had planned to make a reservation later on in the week. The head waiter found us a corner seat under a fan in the airconditioning which was a welcome relief from the evenings humidity. Probably best to check the weather before making a reservation outside. I did feel very sorry for the diner's outside without any air con on a terribly hot evening. Soon after we sat down we were given a pot of the chinese tea & small container of peanuts. The tea was hot but the peanuts were stale & I had the distinct feeling that they might have been sitting on someone else's table before us. I wouldn't have minded so much if we hadn't been charged for them in our bill at the end of the night. As there were only two of us, we ordered a one kg black pepper crab & the cereal prawns & rice. Both came out reasonably quickly & were hot & fresh. Probably my only other complaint of the night was that we were seated near the waiters clearing station & they left trolleys with dirty dishes stacked all around us. I understood that we hadn't reserved a table, but would have been extra annoyed if we had been given the same table with a reservation. The bill was the most expensive that we paid in Singapore, but I would go back again for the authenic seafood alone

Hmmmm I came to Jumbo restaurant only for chili crab :D because the other foods is nothing special hehe,on the sea side n Alwaz crowdy omg!pleeenty with the crab lover(gud for the owner :p)U have to make reservation before u go there!its a must!otherwise u hv to queue up for some "minute" to have the table! Ask ur hotel to make the reservation like I Alwaz did,and don't be shy when u r eating the crab there...:
1
despite being recommended this restaurant as the place to go for seafood...I would actively discourage anyone from coming.the service was disinterested at best.
the seafood dishes took over 2 hours to arrive nothing arrived together.
completely woeful experience.
4
Best place to go to for your seafood fix. Must try chilli crab or pepper crab if you like spicy stuff.

Be advised that this chain is only open at Lunch hours or at Dinner hours as we arrived for a late lunch after our son woke up and ended up having to eat elsewhere til they opened for dinner at 6pm. At precise 6:01pm, we arrived back at the restaurant to find the tables outside pretty much full. I think they only wanted to seat us after our entire party arrived but we were carrying a toddler and said the others were "just in the bathroom" so they seated us and asked us if we could vacate the table by 8pm. We said no problem - we have a child who needs to sleep!We were surprised to see a lot more space inside the air-conditioned tables so of course we chose to sit in here. At 6:10pm, even this was COMPLETELY PACKED full of tour groups, which I had read about from previous tripadvisor reviews. The waiter confirmed that they go through 3 seatings of huge tour groups every evening!We went for Set Menu A for 4 people at S$148 (+17% tax), which has the crab (chili or black pepper), and a few other dishes which were more than enough to fill you up (you can see the menu detail on their website). This was a good deal and I would recommend it for anyone having crab for the first time. We had the chili crab (black pepper is slightly spicier than the chili crab) which we all thoroughly enjoyed. The meat on the crab was excellent, sweet and succulent. We were able to finish by 8pm, no problem, and left, just as the tour group finished eating as well. IN SUMMARY1. You must make a reservation or show up exactly when the restaurant opens for lunch/dinner with your entire party and be prepared to eat fast.2. Food was good but I'm thinking next time, I'd rather go to any of the chili crab restaurants in East Coast Park than any of the ones right bang smack in the city, to hopefuly get away from the crowds.3. Service was excellent, our waitress was really quick at clearing our plates and giving us clean plates as soon as they were filled with prawn or crab shells and excellent at making sure our cups were filled with tea/water
5
Great seafood - Chili Crab, and Lemon Pepper Crab were fantastic. I would not wear your best if you are planning to eat the crab - you'll get covered in it - but it's well worth it! Casual outdoor area. Great selection of seafood, beef & chicken. I'll be back next tri
2
Right by the river and in the center of Clark quay, the center of sg's nightlife scene. The chili crab was bad. I don't know what's wrong with the crab, but it does not have much of crab taste. The other dishes are average. We later went to the jumbo on east coast, much much better
4
There was a good variety of food to choose from. We ordered their must-try's (as this was our first time) and loved them all-- Chili Crab with Mantou, Yam Ring with Scallop, and Cereal Prawns. Servers were attentive and food was served within a reasonable waiting time. Food was served hot. The Chili Crab was huge and its sauce was hot and creamy at the same time. Yum! The scallop dish was a bit too rich for us, having one piece was enough, maybe because it was deep-fried and rather oily. The cereal prawns were just okay.The ambiance was really good, as the restaurant is coined as a gallery. The view from the restaurant is good, actually. The place gets packed just like the other Jumbo Seafood outlets. As reservations are accepted in the restaurant, the only thing I didn't like is having to dine "hurriedly". The receptionist told us upon entering that we must be done by 7pm, which was an hour from being seated
4
Today's dinner was the same food quality as usual but the service levels are different depending on how busy the restaurant is (At a personal level, the staff is doing their best to provide you a good dining experience).As it is a very large restaurant, it does tend to get impersonal though remain efficient. Your seating can make a big difference to the dining experience but is bit of a hit and miss (Seating outside is not guaranteed).However, I am amazed at the efficiency with which this very large functions and still manages to maintain food quality
4
First time I have ever eaten crab! Our waitress was lovely, but couldn't resist increasing my anxieties by stressing what a mess I would get in, covering me up in a bib, covering our bags on the spare chair and bringing lots of extra napkins!! The chilli crab was delicious - we didn't make too much of a mess, the service was good, and the location was lovely - sitting outside next to the river. I knew it would be pricey ($67 for 1.2kg for the two of us) and didn't really mind being stung for the peanuts and Chinese tea which I enjoyed, although agree with other reviewers that this should be free! Definitely something everyone who likes seafood should try while in Singapore
3
We had previously eaten at Jumbo's branches at Dempsey, Clark Quay and Riverwalk. Although not our first time at East Coast Branch but it had been a long while since our last time there. We ordered both chilli crab and salted egg crab. Taste was average. We also tried bamboo clams. Something different but quite pricey. It's nice to sit in the open with the sea in front but unfortunately halfway through our dinner, it started thundering and pouring and the people had to scramble and leave their food and tables. Wonder if they will get a rebate. Would be great if there is a back up plan. Do remember to make reservation if you dine there
5
This place could not have been better. We've been sticking with Hawker centers, and were hoping to try out chili crabs. Flavor was amazing, we sat with a bunch of other travelers and made friends. Warning - if you're used to USA-style crab boils, don't make the mistake we did and order a crab per person - these are giant & are made to share. Get the yummy buns on the side and a pitcher of beer & you'll be all set
5
delicious savory sauce of the crab. Eat it with white rice and peanut. Give a lil touch of lemon chili sauce that have been given. you need to pay for the peanut though. its quite expensive for student budget
5
We tried 2 chili crab at Spore, & this is the best!!!! really worth your money. Highly recommended & we surely will come again
4
This is my favourite place to eat singapore famous chilli crab!
Amazing sauce
Although the service was standard, not friendly at all, and there is no ambience
Will come back only to eat the chilli crab!
3
We wanted to experience chilli crab while on our stay in Singapore. Very pleasant down by the water at Clarke Quay but Jumbo Seafood Restaurant is quite expensive. You even have to pay for the bowl of peanuts they put on the table (which we thought were complimentary). A bowl of broccoli is $21SGD and I think Chilli Crab is overrated and expensive - $56SGD. We took one look at the Wine Menu and decided not to order any. For 3 of us our bill came to $210SGD and we only had a main course. It was a fun night though and I can say I have now had the chilli crab experience
4
We went there without advance reservation. So they gave us the worst table possible (far at the back, in the corner where they stacks their spare chairs and tables) and said that we will only have 1hour to eat. We sat down and order lots of food, it took them 30 mins before the first plate was serve leaving us another 30 mins to eat everything..lucky everything was delicious. Somehow only 1 staff seem to understand English the rest run away every time we tried to ask for something
3
Was there on a weekday. We arrived at 1.35pm and though we note that the official last order is at 2.15pm as restaurant close for afternoon break at 3pm. Nevertheless, the captain who took our order insisted that we have to place our last order then, we were puzzled but did not argue. Food came very quickly, in fact we waited for less than 5 mins before the first dish is served after we placed order. Being Jumbo, we had no doubt about their food being yummy and we were not disappointed.Service-wise is another story altogether. To start things off, we note that they did not place necessary amenities on our table (such as wash bowls as we had ordered crab and prawns), however, when 3 later tables came in after us (all foreigners) we note that they were served with all the necessary stuff and crockery. A bit of discrimination against the locals here aren't we?It started with them serving us the wrong dish, we had ordered Herbal (drunken) prawn and they served us poached prawn instead. No arguments here, they were quick to recognized their error and amended the dish pretty quickly. We were rather amused when the Chinese waiter started serving the herbal prawn into our respective bowls. When the bowl had reached it's brim and is overflowing, he was still trying to stuff more prawns and soup into the tiny bowl.... we wonder if he thinks the bowl will expand in size coz he's stuffing it? Eventually, we had to tell him to stop as there simply is no way to squeeze another prawn & soup into the already overflowing bowl. We note many Chinese servers and all of them were unable to converse in basic english, thank God for a few Malaysian/local staff so that we could at least make ourselves understood.Will we go back? Yes, if we are unable to find anywhere else with better food better location. No, if we have an alternative choice

Jumbo seafood is a must dinner destination when in Singapore. There are a couple of Jumob's on the waterfront, one at Clarke Quay and one between Boat and Clarke Quay...I would highly recommend going to this one which is less manic and more of a local feel. The food is excellent, the chili crab is a must and the whole point of Jumbo's existence. Be prepared to get dirty and don't wear white! Be prepared to be 'hands on' as there is no other way to eat chili crab...and don't worry, everyone is doing the same! We sat at a table with 2 other parties...it gets very busy so a private table can only be secured if you book first! We were happy to share a communal table as it was good fun watching others decorate themselves in chili crab too!The atmosphere is also like no other restaurant...quite noisy and lots going on. It's a fun experience all round
3
I at at Jumbo Seafood on my recent trip to Singapore. It is at Clark's Quay in the heart of the entertainment district of Singapore. I had the Cole Jellyfish Salad starter. It was very good and light. We also ordered the Chili Crab. The crab was okay, but nothing spectacular. I expected it to be spicier. The main thing I didn't like was the service. From the reception to paying the bill was very aloof and unfriendly.I will not likely return, especially with all the other options for chili crab in Singapore
5
Lovely table right on the quayside on a warm Friday evening while Clarke Quay was buzzing all around us. We were late for our booked table, so had to wait for a short while, but once we were sitting at a table the service was good without undue pressure as we waited for another member of our party to arrive.It was certainly worth waiting for the table - the food was glorious, and the chilli crab was delicious.Great place to eat
4
Excellent chilly crabs, egg fried rice and pepper prawns. Delicious food at fairly reasonable prices but not-so-great ambience about sums up this place. A great location on the banks of the river is buttressed by the lip-smacking food. Go with a bunch of people that care more about the food than about the ambience. You are going to have messy hands and tongues on fire from eating the spicy crabs. You are going to be sweaty from the humidity. You are also probably going to be a bit taken aback by the large number of diners packed into tables that are so close you can reach out to the next table for their salt shaker. And the service is just about passable. But the food is makes up for all that
5
Jumbo really lives up to it's reputation of having the best chili crabs in Singapore. Although their prices are higher than most restaurants but their quality is always good.
5
Being in Singapore for a week we tried a few chinese style seafood places - this was the best and most affordable. Best in Singapore and ten times better than the overprices restaurants on Bintan. Make sure to reserve.
5
We have been there second time, I could say that the seafood cuisine is excellent even for capricious visitor. Crab in Chili - superb, lobster sashimi - magic, sharksfin soup - very delicious. Best recommendations !!!
3
I thought $56 a lot to pay for a black pepper crab but I have to declare that I hadn't compared prices with elsewhere because we came across the restaurant by chance and took a table on the spur of the moment. It's a bit of a conveyor belt at Jumbo Seafood. The atmosphere makes you feel you need to eat and get out. You're given a deadline by which you must leave and it's prominently displayed on your table. But the time was very generous for two people - 1.5 hours, which makes you wonder why they do it. The service was prompt and efficient, if a little impersonal. Crab eating is as messy as it gets, but the staff whisk away your bowl of broken shells as it fills. The crab was delicious. I ordered the minimum size, 1kg, and there was plenty of meat, in fact I gave quite a bit to my partner. I would have given four stars to Jumbo but for the brisk, impersonal atmosphere, and a sneaky addition to the bill. When we sat down, a waiter put a small bowl of peanuts on the table and poured two cups of tea, none of which we had asked for, but free tea is common at Asian restaurants. When we got the bill, it included a charge for the peanuts and tea. It wasn't much, but I thought it dishonest to place something on the table unbidden and then charge for it. (The Indian restaurants place a bowl of free pappadums in front of you as you sit down). When we queried the charge, it was referred to a senior waiter, who said rather sniffily that it was 'part of our culture' to do this. I've eaten at many restaurants in Singapore and never been charged for something I didn't order. Sneaky, really. It adds about $4 to the bill for two people after taxes. Not much, but multiply that by the hundreds of diners that churn through every day, and Jumbo is creaming well over $1,000 from unwitting diners. It's a very nice little earner. We didn't pay it
3
I went there with my wife and my daughter. The place was horrifically noisy and crammed. You may be asked to share your table with some other people - not a problem in my case, but if you are out for a date that may be a problem.The food is good, there is no doubt. We ordered the usual crab Singapore-style and 2-3 side dishes to try. The bill was, but that's my opinion, a bit too high for what we had.Service was responsive even in such a busy situation; not particularly friendly but I can understand. Impressive
3
The name just seems to copy from our well known restaurant (Hong Komg) and the logo almost exactly is the Jumbo that we have in Hong Kong. I just doubt if Jumbo is branching to Singapore. Anyway, the view is okay as the sea is just ahead. If the weather good enough, it will be a nice place to try local style seafood. The chili crab for me was just okay, not delicious and hot as I thought but not too bad either. I would say it is okay to eat there if pass by. I would not go there intentionally. I think there are a lot of restaurants could offer that level of food or even much better.
2
Used to go to the store in Clarke Quay when friends come in town. But have to book a week in advance. Most of the time, they will let you wait for half an hour before giving you the pre-booked table. The chilly crabs are small, food are over priced. And they even charge for the plastic aprons! Not value for money
4
Crowded and long queues mean reservations are essential specially on Friday evening and the weekend. Our group of 4 was lucky to get seating quite quickly when the Clarke Quay location thoughtfully sent us to the Riverwalk instead. We took the 4 person set menu with the pepper crab. The portions were generous, the bibs are just the thing to enjoy the seafood (huge prawns which you have to shell yourself, generous crab hearts and pincers, and a delicious fried tilapia) and the accompaniments of noodles and kailan. The chilled Tigers and sago iced dessert cooled us down. Lack of fans, very crowded seating and surprising charge for even peanuts would have been intolerable but the terrific food makes up for those
3
If not for the problems listed below this restaurant would rate five stars for food alone but the service and seating issues lower the rating considerably. Arriving for our reservation we were seated in the center of a three table wide set up directly opposite the dish washing station and next to the waiters main station. As the two tables on either side emptied they were replaced by waitresses doing set up work, preparing table settings and the like. The table to my left was so close that I spent 20 minutes with the rear end of the server in my food as he cleaned the table top. Three minutes after we sat down we received our Chilli Crab, perfect except for the fact we were only given one 6 inch wide plate for our entire meal. I'm not sure how we were supposed to dispose of the crab shells and put the crab and fried rice all on the same tiny plate. They also only gave the two of us one silverware setting (crab pick and cracker). While the crab was served promptly the fried rice showed up just as we were finishing our meal. The chilli crab and seafood fried were rice were excellent as was the bean curd with mushrooms but the entire meal was spoiled by the noise of the dishwashers and the constant running around by the waitresses working next to our table. Understand that this review is for the Riverwalk location only and may not reflect what happens at their other locations in Singapore. If you go make sure you request a table on the river or in the main dining room. Stay away from anything to the left as you face the restaurant

I've eaten here before (2-3 years ago), and had a much better experience. We ordered chilli mud crab, crispy chicken steamed buns to mop up the sauce, steamed rice, and some Mee Goreng noodles. The noodles and the chicken were great. The crab came, but not the rice or the buns to eat with it, even though the person taking the order read it back to us to check. After about 20 minutes we were able to get the attention of a waiter, and after about another 20 minutes, we got the buns and the rice. By then I given up, as the crab wasn't nearly as nice as I had previously experienced there and I just wasn't enjoying it, particularly without the rice or buns. The service isn't good as others have said, however the young man with the tea was really helpful in finding the rest of our order, so all wasn't lost.Not the best food experience in Singapore, and expensive
4
chili crab, and black pp crab. I always like crab, but their gravy is just taste right. I love their lobster too.
4
Had chili crab and side dishes to make for a great meal. Be sure to have plenty of napkins on hand. A great meal.
3
The food was very good although each Pepper and Chili Crab was different in taste. The last one was excellent. The atmosphere is noisy, stretched and too much aircondition on the ceiling. Therefore one star less.
3
Tried this as recommended by my singapore partner, spicy and taste ok but maybe too crowded with tourist and loud diners, somewhat affected the dining experience.
4
Had dinner there during our stay in Singapore. Many people rave about this place so we gave it a try!Really good food - little on the expensive side, but delicious!Apparently free wifi, but waiter told us because we were seated outside, we couldn't use it?!?!?An overall pleasant experience and I will certainly recommend this place to my friends
4
We had several meals here in Mar 2013 it's so popular that it gets very busy advisable to book. The chilli crab it was it's all about and the meal would not be complete without including the dish. On the down side the prawn dishes we tried all seemed to be butterflied with too much topping which did not improve the taste at all. I guess its business but it's a 'get them in and chuck them out as soon as possible' type place but still worth it for the food
5
Just had the most amazing dinner here. The chilli crab was so fresh, perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented. The service was good, but the most memorable bit was the final dish we ordered but was messed up by the server(no issues there). The dish I think was called Mocha spare ribs. The most succulent , flavoursome ribs I have ever eaten in my life. The are two left in the fridge with my name on them for breakfast. Thanks guys, great company, awesome food
4
We frequent this restaurant often, especially if we have visitors we like to bring them to Jumbo's as we are always guaranteed to get a great tasting Chilli Crab. We prefer the East Coast as we see it fitting that we eat seafood practically right on the beach. Service can be poor particularly if it is busy but due to good food we tend to overlook this
5
Fantastic Seafood ! Deliciously made and very good portions. I went with my family of four. On busy days reservation needed. Chili Crab is the best. Friendly staff and quick service though they are very busy. Great ambience next to water. Prices are on high side. You can't expect price to be low in such high quality restaurant. If you haven't been here yet then you must visit next time
5
Represented the best food during my 5 day stay in Singapore. Although, booked table for 8:30pm when we arrived was shown to an outside table with no air con! Was only shown to an indoor table after i expressed my severe dissatisfaction. However, everything else was wonderful - staff and food (which was a nice surprise after having read some of the reviews)
3
Went to the one in East Coast Seafood Centre. Lots of people with tables overflowing into the open space around the restuarant. Food is not bad and pricing was reasonable. The sea facing restuarant gives a good view of the beach.
4
as most do ordered the crab and a side dish, food was good, wine was also good but expensive,
nice evening and lots to do strolling around once dinner is done.
yes there are cheaper but location is great
5
We always take our visitors to Singapore to the Jumbo's on the East Coast as you are always guaranteed to get an excellent Chilli Crab. At times they are crazy busy and service is slow but it is worth it.
5
I love the crab at this location, it is the best. The service is outstanding. 2 of the best severs are Jackie and Ms Fung. They make a great meal even better. We always order a big crab 1.5-1.7 Kg and never have any trouble finishing because it is so good. The location is also great, not many places better than East Coast park. It always good to walk off some of what you eat after meal at jumbos and East Coast park is perfect for this. A very safe area. It is always a busy area so I would recommend that you make a reservation no matter what day of the week that you are eating out. If you want a big crab you can book that to. Please take note I would not recommend all Jumbo's location for their great service but I will recommend this one. Trust me if you love crab (Chili or black pepper) this is the place to come and you cannot beat the Atmosphere
2
I will start by saying I am a big Jumbo's fan. In fact I am a Jumbo's reward card holder. I normally always eat at the East Coast Park location and always have great service. I have eaten at Jumbo's many many times. At this location when I ordered the crab it was substituted for a more expensive crab without questioning or informing me. When the crab was served I questioned why it was not the normal Sir Lankan crab, I was told that they had run out. SO I took them to be honest and ate the crab. When people came in after me and order crab they did get normal crab that I was expecting. I tried to question this and amazing enough no one could speak English. I tried to voice my complaint with the waitress the hostess and no one could speak English including the one that appeared to be in charge. Do not go here choose one of the other locations. I rate this location poor because of the service.They took me for a tourist not knowing that I live and work in Singapore. Non Asian looking people beware
4
Jumbo's has become a symbol of Singapore and you have to try the Chilli crab once in your life. Jumob's though have gone from being a small nice restaurant to a large chain of restaurant that process so many people that the service is just simply horrible. The do everything to get you in and out fast. I have never met a single friendly waiter/ess in my many visits and it's impossible to get service once you place your first order.Jumbo's success will be short lived as a result of this deteriorating service.There are better alternatives such a Red House on the East Coast or no sign board. In my opinion a much better option
5
WOW! A favorite restaurant for our wonderful Singaporean friends to take when we are visiting Singapore. Can't say enough about the chili crab, the black pepper crab, tofu, steamed bread............the list goes on and on. Great place for families, friends, expats and tourists to enjoy an authentic Singapore meal.
5
A friend n I landed up at 11pm. My nth time but the first ever for this friend. We were seated, bibbed up, served. I was so happy to see my friend totally enjoying the trademark Chilli Singaporean CrabIt is consistent every time I go there. About 65 to 70 SGD every time. For me it's my most dirty secret in Singapore. How else can I justify dipping into some right after a plate full of spaghetti just 2 hours ago
3
Manically busy - though service and attentiveness very good. Our waitress was first rate. Food was enjoyable and well presented. The sticky cod in sweet chilli was fantastic. Just think about what you order as is quite easy to over order and end up with a mountain of grub! Acid test - yes I would return
2
A tourist trap at its best.Locals taking visitors and suckers like us...Ineffective and indolent management. Hard working floor staff trying to do their job..just no support from those who should know !Food is esculent but in this city with SO many to chose from...move on from this establishment
5
One of Singapore's signature dishes is chili crab and this is the best! We sampled lots of the sides and starters and all were delicious. Lovely view of the harbour as well.
5
Just like the rst but an excelent water front location. You can go for a before or after dinner stroll along the water.
4
Especially the chilli crab, our favorite. Had the Alaskan King crab also during our last visit, very nicely done but pricy.

Too crowded
Great chilli crab, pepper crab, crispy fish, drunken prawns, and mango dessert. Tried everything and loved it. ..

My wife , son and I went for a dinner in this restaurant . This is not our first visit to this restaurant . when ever we visit our son in Singapore , we go there . every time , we find ! . fantastic quality of food 2. excellent taste 3. Decent service 4 . wonderful atmosphere This time , however we find prices have been increased and , if they increase any more , then i think , it will be pricey

We were visiting a friend who is living in Singapore who insisted that we must go to Jumbo's for Chilli Crab. It was just at the tail end of Chinese new year so the place was bursting at the seams and appeared to be completely chaotic, but we were quickly and efficiently seated. We were amazed at just how many people were dining here.The service was very good considering the volume of people being served. We ordered both a chilli crab and a pepper crab and were delighted with both.An interesting aspect of Singaporean Chinese new year is the tradition of a family dinner that begins with a large dish of shredded vegetables placed with some ceremony in the centre of the table, then all the family jointly toss the vegetable in the air with their chopsticks, the higher the toss the better the good fortune. The table next ours kindly offered us sample of the dish as compensation for their noisy enjoyment of this ceremony. I can't say the dish is in any way exceptional but the concept is great as a way to bond as a family group, and we felt quite special to be included in this family's event.So chinese new year is not the time to go to Jumbo's for a quiet meal, but anytime is great for a fabulous chilli or pepper crab experience.Highly recommende
5
My Aunt and Uncle live in Singapore, yes I am lucky because they know all the good spots. Jumbos is not a good spot it is a qunitessential Singporean delight, much like Chicken rice and a visit to a Hawker stall. In my opinion Singapore is if not the best, in the top three food cities in the world. So what to get here, of course the chili crab is good but if you want to go big get the black papper crab with some chili sause for dipping. The fried buns are amazing, the coconut fried rice excellent and the steamed kai ling is a nice side. Over all the whole experience is fun, you wear a bib, most locations are out side, I have eated at three. Get a cold Pitcher of Tiger Beer the local brew of which I have drank many, many pints! Okay will tell you my uncles secret, you call ahead and order your crab to size and how many you will want. Service is excellen
2
Made a reservation on weekends. Expected to be crowded!!! It was hot at the outdoor seating!!! Restaurant was full house!!! We ordered a set for 4 with additional a la carte salt and pepper crab!!!Their food were not in sequence!!! First they served fried rice followed by stir fried asparagus then steamed fish!!!And then the most awaited dishes crab... But we were disappointed with the taste. Crab is not fresh and doesn't taste good. Another crab same as well... But their service still up to expectation despite full house!!!Sorry to say we won't visit any Jumbo Restaurant anymore!!
4
Well worth the wait for the Chilli Crabs! Service was a little on the slow side... But if you're not in a hurry, then its worth the wait. The other dishes were also nice, but if you want good Chilli Crabs at a reasonable price, this is the place to go
4
I am not a seafood person buut when i went to jumbo, i loved it. there were lots of other foods. The staff were very friendly to my children and we were pleased. The food was tasty since there were more choices. Unforotunaly the luch time menu is rubbish. NO SATAY"S the atmosphere is delightful and then you can have a stroll on the beach when your done. The food takes a long time to make so you need to pre-book your dinne
4
The famous seafood restaurant in Singapore, located in the good location in a central area of the city, Clarke Quay. Very easy to get to this restaurant, by MRT. Try chiili crab or Black pepper crab, u must like it :D
3
Thsi place is a tourist trap known for overcharging customers. Ask for the prices before you order and check your bill carefully!
4
I maybe have not visited most of seafood places in Singapore. But among all seafood places I've tried, Jumbo has the best chili crab taste. Try order it with the small bun. However, the price is not cheap.
4
This place has a lot of seafood to offer. However, I had to wait for a long time before I could get a table. The store was crowded and quite noisy, so not the place if you are looking for a cosy ambience. All of their food items and well seasoned and cooked. The fish was not as fresh as the ones Iâ€™ve had at seafood restaurants in Bangkok though. Their chilli crab was excellent. Service was okay
4
My family usually eat at Long Beach but this time, mum wanted to try out Jumbo, She said it is cheaper than Long Beach (I dunno though). So we made a reservation on the 7th day of CNY (Ren Ri), which means that the place was super packed and we had to wait for 45 for our Chili Crab to appear. Food was served one dish by one dish. Meaning to say, the 2nd dish was only served when we finish the 1st dish. I guess this was due to lots and lots of customers and many people were asking when their food will arrive. However, the quality of food made up for the long wait. Love their Chili Crab and hopefully will have the chance to try their other crab dishes. Tables were turned quickly but the bill took a long time to come. Even after signing the bill, we had to wait for the waitress to finish explaining to her colleague about some issues. And they did this sorting out right in front of us, holding the bill in her hand, She should have hand us the receipt before doing the talking. Service could be better
5
I used to frequent Jumbo seafood out on East Coast parkway a lot and decided to try out this outlet. We arrived with no reservation and lucky after 20 minute wait got a table with an hour before a reservation for the table, which on Saturday night is great. Its always packed and the chilli crab was up to standard although waiter service is a non existent after they take an order, they took the order and forgot the ice cold tiger beer which is hard when its an electronic handheld device system and a clumsy waiter splattered us as well. The steamed buns are very small so order extra when you do for mopping up the chilli sauce. The fried rice is also excellent. Why they need to resort to the old "trap the tourist" trick of pouring green tea and placing a bowl on peanuts on the table without saying its actually a paid extra is rather sad for a place so good. But of those who havent tried then book a table and treat yourself as its still worth the taste even if price
4
We could dine at this always crowded restaurant(Riverwalk one) after second trial.On the first day, we called them at around 6p.m. for 8 people for 7p.m. but fully booked until 9:45 so gave up. On the second day, we called first thing in the morning for 2 persons and could secure our seats for 8:00 p.m. though our original idea was for 7p.m.The place is facing the river but located in the area between two bridges and the atmosphere is not so good as those in Clarke or Boat Quay. We can order four or five different taste of Crab but we ordered most famous Chili Crab. The taste was too hot and spicy so could not tastecrab but could taste Chili mainly. Maybe once is enough to tell what Chili Crab is.The price of Chili Crab dish is about US$70 (good for two though) after adding S.C and GST.If we go next time I would try other taste
4
Despite its busy-ness, we only had to wait 5mins for a table. Ordered chilli crab, yang chow fried rice and scallop with fried yam. The latter was my fave- a must try! I don't usually eat crab but this crab was very nice too. Great view and large open air restaurant, very busy, just how we like it! We ate at the East Coast restaurant and waiting for a taxi was a nightmare, but other than that, def go and try it out
3
Went to East Coast Park and decided to give Jumbo Seafood a go.Price wise was slightly cheaper than Red House Seafood Restaurant. Service was a little slow and took a long time for the food to come out. I am giving it a 3 star because the service is plain horrible
5
Having frequented jumbo at Clarke Quay on many occasions we opted to try east coast which is closer to home for us. We weren't disappointed and though heavily popular on weekend it has a very nice atmosphere. Would recommend you book ahead and also reserve an outside table (weather permitting). The indoor seating area tends to be. Little too noisy in those busy periods, so if you're intent on having dinner conversation you're better off in the outside area
4
lobster & shrimp are very fresh
black pepper crab is very big & delicious
chili crab source with bread are very match & delicious
coconut juice is very fresh & sweet
5
If I were rich, I would fly there just for dinner. This is one of the national dishes and it is wonderful. The chili sauce and bread that comes for dipping is what I still dream about.
4
Enjoyed almost all the seafood dishes - especially the braised lobster in superior broth, the chilli crab with man tou and the salted egg prawns.
5
We had no reservation, which apparently is required.We were turned away as they were full but we insisted that we are willing to wait, and after a while, we got a table.Ordered Chili Crab, it was amazing, one of the best dishes i have ever had, this is something everyone should try. I was told Jumbo makes the best chili crab and indeed it was amazing.I would highly recommend this place for Chili CrabTip is if you are visiting, call ahead and make a reservation, if you want a nice table by water
3
Yikes! Everyone talks about the Chili Crab at Jumbos so we splurged for dinner. Got one order of the crab and one order of the prawns. The crab was OK but I've had better or equal and when we saw the bill we wished we had gone to another restaurant that serves the dish. With no appetizers and just 2 soft drinks the bill was $85 usd. Singapore is really a fun place to visit for the wealthy
5
This location is crowded but if you are willing to sit wherever, you might end up on the sidewalk with a great view for people watching. One $56 crab was enough for three of us because we ordered fried rice which was some of the most delicious I've had, plus a few other side dishes
5
Loved eating here especially when we have a special occasion. It has enough seating space and when have special needs, arrangements were made to accommodate, which I appreciated. The food is definitely value for money. Ordering the sea cucumber braised duck is a must everytime. The fried Kang kong with sambal and mee goreng are really nice. Crabs are always the highlight. Succulent and very reasonably priced. Only thing which I don't feel the restaurant cooked as well is frog legs. Other than this, loved the variety of food served and appreciated its consistency in delivery over the number of years that I have known it. Coming twenty years...
5
I love visiting Jumbo Seafood whenever back in Singapore. This is the chain of restaurants for a good chili crab, and other good quality Chinese style seafood. I particularly enjoy their shellfish and their tofu with spinach. The Jumbo at East Coast is supposed to be the absolute best in quality, however I enjoyed this location for its location, and service was good and quick
5
I've been going to Jumbo seafood restaurant since mid-nineties and it's never failed me. Absolute musts are chili and pepper crabs (order large size Sri Lankans), mee goreng and baby kailang, fresh mangos for dessert. Nowadays they also have seating closer to the sea with a bit of a view. Anyhow, this is no fine dining but seriously delicious business with excellent food. Pull your sleeves up and enjoy
4
Vistited the one at East Coast with Singaporean friends. They know what to order so we had a great dinner. If we were on our own we may not have been able to get the right combination of dishes. Very good ...service is okay. It is so crowded I guess the servers have to move fast.
4
Great seafood, nice ambience, decent prices...what more can one ask for! Try the crab (both chilli and black pepper variety are great) for sure.
4
Chilli Crab is the favorite here. Tried some other dishes which were also pretty good. Would like to be visit again.
1
change two time came out the same quality... captain no proper training including the staff. price was too expensive to pay for this kind of services, untensil, non air-con... the toilet so stinks to go in... never go again
4
Jumbo Seafood have many locations across Singapore but this one is excellent as it is right on the river so centrally located for lots of other bars and Cafes at Clark Quay which is only a 5 minute walk over the bridge.Food here was excellent and good value for money. sometimes you have to wait up to 45 minutes for a table but its worth it (we only waited 5 mins)Staff are very freindly and service is prompt
2
We ordered according to the images.All around us the crab dishes looked amazing but we wanted something simple. We had excellent service, table moved when rain started, jasmine tea bottomless cup and crispy squid starter was good. We were advised that a small Supreme Seafood fried rice would be ample for two. The menu image showed a good amount of seafood, egg and greens. What arrived was plain rice, one partial prawn, and some shredded cabbage. We thought we'd been served the wrong order and showed the waiter the comparison and he called the manager who said "image is only for advertisement". The garlic spinach looked much better when it arrived but by then we had decided to leave. Cancelled our order, paid and found a different place.I'm sure the hundreds of guests don't notice when eating their huge shellfood servings that the images don't match the servings. It would seem minor as the famous mud crabs are devoured.We were disappointed. I wish I'd remember to take a photo of the two together, menu image vs dish served
5
I visited with 3 kids (8 yrs,5 yrs and 3 mnths) and the service was exceptional. They pointed out items on the menu that were popular with kids and recommended dishes that weren't spicy. We had a collection of dishes including their famous Chilli Crab. All the dishes were fantastic and arrived quite promptly. The total till was S$140 for 2 adults and 2 kids.We went to the Jumbo Seafood outlet in Riverside Mall and there is another one a couple of hundred metres down the river at the Riverwalk. It should be noted that I could not get a table for dinner on any of the 4 nights we were in Singapore. Try and book early - probably even before you arrive as they take online bookings as well. Getting a table for lunch was easier but bookings are advisable
4
A chain but still they produce top quality seafood and the early evening views along east coast are worth the trip. You will need to wash up afterwards, as black pepper crab and their other hard to eat but easy to enjoy seafood dishes are best eaten by hand
4
...try the chili crab. It's expensive - $56/ kg when we dined Jan. 11 - but an interesting experience. The two of us split one, 1 kg chili crab and a bowl of seafood (very little seafood). With two beers, the bill was $100. Pretty pricey. We had probably 10 servers, but still the service was a bit poor because there was no consistency, and we couldn't keep track of who was assigned to our table. Outside tables have a nice view of the river
3
Reserved a table for 8 on Christmas eve. Pleasantly surprised it wasn't really crowded at 7pm. Ordered the usual Chili Crab, Salted Egg Crab, Tofu, Vegetables, Cereal prawn, sweet and sour pork and dessert. Pros: Service is great, food is good but honestly, we regretted ordering the pork. Should have stick to seafood. Cons: The timing of each dish being serve is wrong! They serve the vegetable, 15 mins later, serve the tofu, another 10 mins later serve the pork. After about 20mins, they serve the salted egg crab. Finishes the crab, have to wait yet another 10mins or so for the chilli crab. Spoil the appetite
5
This is our top choice seafood chain. We frequent the one at Boat Quay. the Riverside one. The service is good and food excellent.Order either the pepper or chilli crab with fried buns. They are really yummy!Order the deepfried tofu and sambal kangkong...all done to perfection. The scallops in yam is also worth trying.The membership discount makes it worthwhile to visit the restaurant regularly. We often take visitors or guests to this restaurant. There are indeed many seafood restaurants in Singapore and they are well known but to have one that have personalised service and good food is not easy to come by. The bigger the outlet, the less personal they will be.We love the restaurant for taking care of just average customer like us
4
This is a great location although extremely busy. Best Chili Crab in Singapore. Service good and food very good.
3
We wanted to try famed chili crab; personally we are not big fans of it. We liked our other dishes better, less work, better taste to us.
4
Jumbo serves the best cereal prawns however a bit expensive...realized later on other hawker food centre can also serve nearly as good as jumbo! If wanting to eat here good commendation if you will reserve ahead of time especially on peak hours.
4
Came here in GrandPrix weekend in 2011.. really enjoyed the experience of the chilli crab and drunken prawns.. service was very attentive however its definitely expensive... unless you want to really splurge then this is a great place to be....
3
All other dishes are kinda disappointed me, only the spicy crab and the vegie stir fry tofu are good. I will only go back to this place for those two. Others are really average and not worth the price
4
4 of us dined at the jumbo restaurant at clarke quay after having spent the last 3 nights at the marina bays sands and having dinner there. I think jumbos was by far better than the average and extremely overpriced meals we had at the marina bay sands. We had the chilli crab (delicious), pepper crab, fried rice with XO sauce (best fried rice ive ever had), cheesy king prawns (similar to lobster mornay), crispy fried sqiud (really crunchy). Great seafood experience overall without the huge price tag that alot of places have in singapore. The service was pretty average but unfortunately it's what ive come to expect from most restaurants in singapore
5
We found this restaurant on a rainy new years eve and if you truly want the best Chilli Crab and also Singapore Sling come here! The Chilli Crab was amazing and definitely the best Singapore Sling I have ever had, can not wait to take our son back in mid January to experience this restaurant
3
I came here with family in 1st January of 2013. It has good atmosphere restaurant with great view around. The food, like, crab, shrimp, tofu, and the vegetable (i forgot the name) are have a good taste.But the service is too slow. The food come one by one with a very-very long intervals between it. Maybe because it's 1st January, and the restaurant is full of visitors.Overall, my experience in this restaurant is good. Maybe i will come to this restaurant again in my next visit to singapore
4
If your in singpore, then you must try the chilli crab from here.We came here, after reading about Singapore famous chilli crab. We did not have a reservation and we still got a table (we were lucky) we order the two kilo chilli crab and some vegies and friend rice and it was really good. This place is well worth a visit if you like seafood
3
We went to the Jumbo restaurant at Clarke Quay for lunch on a normal Monday and it was nearly full, which we thought was a good sign on the quality of the food. We ordered their famous Singapore Chilli Crab, Scallops with XO sauce and a local vegetable favourite, Water Spinach (locally known as kangkung) with belacan with boiled rice. We were disappointed with the quality of all 3 of the dishes as we've had better ones in Sydney. On top of that it was relatively pricey. Service and ambience was average. Before I went to Singapore all my friends told me I must go to Jumbo to have their chilli crab. Well, I've tried it and for me the entire experience was only average
4
Just order all the variety of seafood. Not a typical seafood fan here but I still enjoy trying out a variety of seafood once in a blue moon. Particularly liked the butter crabs. Kind of expensive but food quality is okay.
4
Typical noisy place but the drunken prawns were excellent, plus chili crab and pepper crab were awesome as expected for signature dishes.
5
An absolute must to visit. The chilli and pepper crabs are delicious! Ask the waiter for extra bread rolls so that you may enjoy the chilli crab gravy, YUM!! And don't forget to ask for a apron.
4
Jumbo is a big chain in Singapore and so comparisons between the different branches is inevitable. I cannot honestly say the food tastes different between branches, but there is no doubt that eating "near" the sea adds a little extra to the experience. We ate the chilli crab (of course) and it was good. It is expensive, but it's a nice treat for the family. Always a bit unnerving when you pay by weight and don't really know the cost till the bill arrives, but one thing is for certain - not cheap! If you can ignore that, go and enjoy. It's a nice treat.
1
Four of us had dinner at East Coast Jumbo two nights ago (Dec 2012). For S$450+, both the lobster and red grouper left us suspecting that they were NOT "live seafood" as they were supposed to be. The meat was powdery and tasteless. I believe they served us some speciments that died the night before. VERY DISAPPOINTED especially for that price!!!Like many restaurant chains, once their think they became known, quality drops quickly. I would definitely not go to Jumbo again, not for a long long time
5
We wanted a great chilli crab experience and we got it at the Jumbo Seafood Restaurant at th East Coast Seafood Centre. The place was abuzz with people and the food was superb. We will absolutely be back there again next time we visit Singapore. Can't recommend this place enough.
4
Go with this: razorblade clams, scallops, dry chilli king prawns, and some black pebber crab, and you can't fail. To me Singapore is mostly great Asian and sea food. Hawker's is way, way overrated and most of the western food is average. Though you might want to try the excuisite Sunday Brunch at Ritz Carlton
5
Came here on recommendation of a friend and also according to our hotel Jumbo is top 3 for their famous chilli crab. It's hard to get a table sometimes but our hotel concierge made a reservation and we had a late dinner at 9pm on a Tuesday, and the place was completely packed. The crab was delicious! My mom is vegetarian and they also had a vegetarian set course which was quite good. Overall the food is pricey, but to be expected in a touristy area. It was great eating right by the Singapore River, was able to walk around CQ after dinner and check out the night life
4
Visit this for the quintessential Singapore experience - eating Chilli crab. We also ordered the mee goreng, deep fried baby squid and youtiau, and black pepper crab - all were good. Other less notable, though still quite tasty dishes, included satay, sambal kangkong and spinach with 100 year old eggs. Washed down with beer and tea, the total cost per person (there were ten of us) came out to about S$40, which is quite reasonable. They even threw in a platter of fruits for free. Do come early if you want to get a table on the verandah, otherwise you will be given a table under shelter or in the air-conditioned room upstairs
5

Really good chilicrab! Unfortunately, the chicken satay was not good at all. Relatively expensive, 52 dollars per kg.
3
Chilli crab was good, definitely enjoyed it. However, because we didn't have reservations, we shared a table with strangers (which was actually ok) but the lighting and service reminded me of a cafeteria. And for the price, I expectd more.
3
Variable quality,non-English speaking waiting staff,slow service,over priced.............what's to like?
4
Although their pepper crab will always be my favorite, each time I come here I discover something new and exciting.
4
The place is normally busy with a great atmosphere; relaxed and fun. The service is good and the crab (and other food) is very good.
4
You haven't truly visited Singapore until you've had chili crab (and chicken rice, but that's another review) and this place is famous for it and all things seafood- the razor clams were very good as well, everything I saw looked great.Not much more to say except bring PLENTY of napkins and wet wipes, you're going to need them

Jumbo serves as my favourite seafood place for my trip to Singapore. We ordered all the signature crab dishes – chili, pepper, salted egg. Now, I really have to comment on the size of the crabs. I think they are Sri Lankan mud crabs and you really get huge muscular crabs which provide more than a bite-ful! The chili crab was a bit too spicy for us but the sauce goes excellently with rice. The pepper crab was also a bit too peppery and we were beginning to suspect that we just had to acclimatize to local flavours when then salted egg one arrived which turned out to be the hit of the night. The drunken shrimps were fun though some people might have issue with actually seeing the shrimp literally getting drunk in front of us before being cooked. Cereal prawns also great but the fish was a bit rubbery – a bit of a letdown. Don’t expect very fluent service – some of them don’t speak good English

I didn't make a booking on a Saturday night but got a table for 2 fairly quickly. Placed an order for starters and a main of crab and a plate of vegies. Both the main and the starters came out all together and the vegies at the end. Good food though. Just watch out for the extras. They place a bowl of peanuts on the table when you arrive. You'll pay for that. And then a glass of tea, same and then they'll send out a bowl of bread with your crab. All extras on top of your bill unless you refuse them..
3
Ehhh… The chili crab was tasty but the price was a bit steep. This is not the best chili crab in Singapore I prefer No Sign Board to Jumbo but I would say they best chili crab was this nice place on the second floor of this white building that actually doesn’t have a sign board on it. It was hard to find, I only found because I was going there with some locals who live in the neighborhood
4
We had to wait a while for an outdoor table (you know you are in trouble will you have to pull a number and wait for it to be called!) at this extremely popular casual restaurant. It was worth the relatively short wait as we were give a table alongside the river. This does mean that the world is walking past your table and so this is probably not the spot for a romantic dinner, but it is typical Singapore outdoor casual dining. Service was good, the food excellent if delivered in an odd sequence with plates of vegetables coming before we saw any seafood. We didn't pick up the bill but prices appeared reasonable. Well worth a visit if you like seafood. Also note the bathrooms are upstairs, appear to be for the public and were not the usual Singapore standard
4
The food was excellent. We were not game enough to give the chilli crabs a go as neither of us had eaten one before. Had scallops and cereal prawns which were just amazing. The service was a bit rushed but friendly
5
A great meal of chili crab and other exceptional seafood in an outdoor environment. The staff is efficient and always there to assist as needed. A must stop in Singapore.
4
Wonderful food and very good wines. Peppercrab are the best
Staff did not all understand English.
You get chopsticks to eat with.. interesting:)
4
This place was seriously THE highlight of my visit to Singapore! The service is very mediocre but their Chili Crab is to die for! (Dishes here are a bit overpriced but still worth a try!) The seats arrangement are kind of awkward here and they make you share tables with random people if you don't make a reservation in advance but aside that everything is great
4
What a feast... What a place... And the crab .... Awesome ... We were a large group and it was the perfect place ....It was a typical relaxing place ... Everybody working their way on the crabs talking loudly among them .... And we opted for a group menu which was affordable and specially good for a group...Now the food was here and it was awesome ... I didnt like the pepper crab ... But the chilli crab wow ... Awesome... I absolutely loved it ...There was a king prawn fried in some kind of sweet cereal which was so so good .... Squid in with vegetables wow ... It was an absolute feast .... Please do go there and eat at one of the most favourite place for chilli crab ...
3
The staff were friendly and efficient. Though located along east coast, we requested for air condition therefore there was not much of a view for us. We order chili crab, salted egg crab and both was quite a disappointment. The chili crab was spicy but did not have aroma, salted egg was quite tasteless. Steamed fish was over cooked thus the meat was quite tough. We also had drunkun prawn but the "soup" was bitter. I dont think the food is worth the price, i could find better zi char store serving nicer food at a much affordable price
5
There are several Jumbos around town, but I like this location the best. It is a cab ride away, but right on the water and full of local folks enjoying crab and other interesting dishes. The chili crabs are, of course, amazing. We also had drunken shrimp and cold pitchers of beer. A really fun night
2
We had high expectations as both our hotel and some of our friends recommended this restaurant as nice, casual and delicious seafood restaurant. The service was was friendly but rushed. The food was nothing but average. There was no taste of fresh seafood, only taste of different sauces and spices. Two starters, two main courses and three soft drinks = 170 SGD. Too much I would say. There is also a rushed feeling all the time. You have little more than one hour to eat - the restaurant hopes that you will understand this. This is indicated when you escorted to the table. Go somewhere else
4
Visited the restaurant to celebrate my in law's birthday and we ordered from the set menu for 8 persons. We reserved the table at least one week in advance (online reservation available) and was given a nice table on the 2nd floor (air-conditioned).The food is generally very good and tasty and we enjoyed almost every dish. I would have given the restaurant an excellent rating if not for the meagre crab claws.2 Chilli crabs were included in our set menu. So there were a total of 4 crab claws. Out of which, 2 of the claws were exceptionally meagre. When we broke the crab claw, the meat within the claw is only about 1/3 of the size of its claw. We complained to the restaurant crew about the incident and they took away the 2 meagre crab claws. The crew replaced the 2 crab claws with a whole new chilli crab.Although the incident was quite a turn-off, I think the service recovery from restaurant was pretty satisfying. At least they did not shrug off our complaint and had replaced with a whole new chilli crab. So I would give a thumb up for their service.The chilli crab gravy was very good and it goes very well with the fried "man tou".My other advice- Book a seat by calling/emailing the restaurant in advance.- If you are parking at the nearby public carpark, make sure your meal time is sufficiently covered by parking coupons. The carpark wardens are very active in this carpark
5
Chili crab here is very yummy! Black pepper crab is also good. Always had a hard time deciding which one to go for when I went only with my husband and couldn't order both as it would be too much food. If you go in a big group, definitely should try both. The atmosphere is nice especially Clark Quay location. I would recommend to go in the evening so you can sit outside and enjoy the breeze. Also should order the fried Chinese bun to dip in the gravy, it tastes amazing
4
The food was excellent. Loved the scallops the most. Cereal prawns were excellent. and the greens with oyster sauce done to perferction. Looking forward to visitiing again. And good service.
4
Reservation is a must at this place had to wait 40 min for a sharing table it is crowded on the weekends. Long wait but the black pepper crab and the fried buns make the wait worth while. Huge crab need 2 persons to share.
5
I never pass Singapore without a visit to the Jumbo Seafood restaurant @ Clarke Quay. Great location; Best Crabs in town and super service. Dont miss this!
4
Nice place along East Coast Park. Jumbo is Located at the the Seafood center. Be sure to try the chilli crab and black pepper crab. Service of the waiting staff could be better but the food tastes great.
5
Please book the VIP Room otherwise you will end up like sitting in the middle of fish market...
Too noisy
3
Had been advised to go there, but I have left with mixed feelings.If you plan to take what they are known for, meaning their wide choice of chilli or black pepper crab, you won't be disappointed. But when it comes to try other options, the staff both in the kitchen and serving seem completely unable to deliver on time. We had all finished our starters and crabs, when my wife got finally served with the only dish she had ordered - a dish that we had to ask for something like 6 times... that we actually sent back as coming too late.Despite a big number of people taking care of customers, there is a strong lack of organization to greet, sit and serve customers in a timely manner. Fortunately, food and mainly crab is very good
5
The best crab dishes I've ever had was there at my brother's David's birthday and it was great, we had Baby Squids in Sambal Sauce,Kailan Vegetables,Steamed Fish, Black Peppered Crab and of course Chili Crab, just awesome !! Washed them all down with a couple of iced cold Tsing Tao beer!! We were there on a Monday night so it was quiet but perfect for not having to wait too long for the food. Usually packed on the rest of the week!! Have Fun!
4
600 seater restaurant next to the ocean serving Chinese sea food, specialising in chilli crab. We were 5 plus a baby in high chair. Together with a jug of Tiger beer and plenty of well presented tasty food yam scalllops, beancurd, hongkong noodles seafood rice buns brocoli and teas fnishing up with a very good 1.2 kg chilli crab and lots of mess it cost 248 dollars. We enjoyed the whole thing. Because its very busy don't expect super fast service when you decide mid course that you want something added or more drinks etc but it definitely does work. Book it preferably though even on busy day you will get in but may wait some time. If you haven't got a car and the rain comes expect a problem getting a taxi, so be warne
1
The experience---------------------We arrived at the restaurant around 6-7 pm and heard we had to make a reservation, so we made one for 9 pm. But before that we had to stand in line and the staff from Jumbo Seafood were talking amongst themselves instead of to their customers. I thought: "Ok, I'll let it slide. They must be busy."At 9 pm we had a similar situation, but we were helped in the end. We sat at a nice place near the water, but the waitress wasn't friendly and was very rude. First off, it took awhile to receive the menu. Secondly, which is worse, we wanted to order black pepper crab and some bread. But she said: "It doesn't have sauce, chilli crab has sauce." I wanted the black pepper crab and the bread! But she was pushing us, so at the end I changed the order to chilli crab. Ordering bread did not go well either. My mum asked her how she sells the bread. The waitress replied: "Two bread each." Hello! We want to decide the amount for ourselves! We also ordered some fried squid and longan drink.After a long wait, we received our drinks and the fried squid. The fried squid... I saw more fried mie (white noodles) than fried squid and it wasn't spicy. A while later, the chilli crab came with the bread. We received more sweet crab sauce than crab meat. Yes, I did not write "chilli", because also this dish wasn't spicy.I thought we had been served terribly and that the food was meeeh, but there was something more than terrible that awaited us later. We hadn't finished drinking our longan drink and we were already rushed to leave by receiving the bill!Final opinion-----------------I have eaten at various places in Singapore and I have been to many! Jumbo Seafood - The Riverwalk looks fancy but looks is deceiving! Even at a simple foodcourt or foodstand the service and food are excellent! But this restaurant... Should I even call this a restaurant?

Jumbo has been around for a long time. From a seaside eatery that was an old favorite for taking your extended family out to dinner when you were lucky at the track or the lottery. The business model was renewed to be more contemporary and to take advantage of the considerable cache that the Jumbo name had with Japanese tourists. The food at Jumbo is good. My review should in no way dissuade you from trying Jumbo out, especially if this is your first stab at seafood Singapore style. You will like the seafood at Jumbo. However for the jaded Singaporean palate, Jumbo's offerings may be pedestrian.Definitely make a point to have the following selections:1. Chili crab. Jumbo makes a solid representation of this iconic Singaporean crab dish.2. Cuttlefish-stuffed Chinese Fritters. These are also a traditional menu selection at a Singaporean seafood dinner.3. Mee Goreng. This Malay dish gone Chinois is another classic of Singaporean seafood dining. The prawns are crunchy and mixed with chili sauce, scallions and fishcakes....just good.So, on your first visit to Singapore, going to Jumbo is not criminal. If however, on your subsequent visit or if you settle in Singapore, you will be expected to be able to carry on a cogent discussion about the merits of the Sri Lankan crab at Forture done with salted egg yolks versus the peppery allure of the crab at Eng Seng
3
im sorry to say it, but really.. the taste is average indeed.. nothing so special.. maybe because it was too sweet for me.. the must-try is absolutely the mango pudding
4
Food was as good and fresh as usual. I was out voted and we had black pepper crab but The Chilli crab is much better. Very good Value.
5
Really enjoyed a nice night with some friends over some great seafood and beer in a pleasant location with lots of choice.
The Chilli Crab is not too be missed but the other dishes were also very good.
5
The food is really good. We usually order a mix of different small portions and then share it amongst us. This is all fine and catered for.
4
Great service & food.My wife and I celebrated our birthdays on 15 Oct 2012 at this first Teochew restaurant at Chui Huay Lim Club opened by Jumbo Group. This is the second time we been there.The place is quite classy for a Chinese restaurant. Food price is average for such a Chinese restaurant. The food are fresh and good. Service are great as well. Overall we spend like $100 for 2 persons

We visited this restaurant chasing the famed Chilli mud crab experience. From other reviews, the Jumbo at the East Coast Seafood centre may have been a better option.While the food met expectations, the service was virtually non-existent. The minute we were seated we were then told by another waiter that we couldn't site there (retracted after some discussion with colleagues). We resorted to pouring our own drinks (and ordered champagne, which should have indicated we were there for a nice meal), never got the water we asked for three times and were given an incorrect dish LADEN with garlic.The mud crab was great but dulled by the service - locals at neighbouring tables were looked after, but we had to virtually beg for finger-bowls, only after we noticed customers with less messy dishes enjoying them!Next time I will look for a venue that wants my business more. Newton Circus food stalls perhaps?Location: this restaurant is adjacent to Clark Quay so there are lots of bars and restaurants in the immediate area
1
The staff had no clue of what they were doing. Basically everything was done incorrectly. The food was simply bad and you got the feeling that they served bad food and that they thought they could get away with that based on their "good" reputation. I definitely do not recommend this restaurant
2
All the hype of Chilli Crab dampened our spirits after eating it at Jumbo Seafood at ECP. The service staff is ample to pull you in, they will place the peanuts and the napkins and charge you for it so if you do not need it tell them before they take the order. It was a really long long waiting before the kailan , chilli crab arrived on our table. All the fuss about the chilli crab, the apron to wear before you eat it... the sauce seemed tasted just like ketchup with chillies in it .... it was awful. The kailan was average but portion was really small for the price you have to pay.We would rather try other places for chilli crab than this one
4
There are actually 2 Jumbo Seafoods near Clark Quay area, one by the river and one by the streets near Clark Quay MRT. Usually they are pretty booked, so be sure to call and make a reservation first if you plan to go during meal times! I went to the one by the streets with my friend and ordered their chili crab, taro scallop, fried fish cake, and oatmeal shrimp. They were good portions and way too much for 2 people! But they can pack it up for togo if you can't finish. Also note, the do limit your dining time if you go during peak hours. Overall, decent service with good quality food
4
We went mainly for Chili Crab and were not disappointed. We also ordered pepper crab, rice, several veggies, coconuts with some of the best water inside and several different types if shrimp. We went with a party of 8. You HAVE to make a reservation, everyday of the week. There is also another restaurant called No Signboard in the same complex. In fact most of complex is nothing but seafood restaurants all over looking the water.
3
The food was fine. I don't understand why everyone raves about this restaurant. There are many better places to eat in Singapore. Whatever the reason, it is very popular.
3
Food was actually not too bad, if the server was nicer. She was very very impolite, and though we said we would clear the table by 8:30, she kept rushing us in a very impatient attitude. We all would have a nice supper otherwise.
5
We came here on friend's recommendations and were not disappointed.We ordered some of the following items:- Cereal prawn- pepper crab- Chilli Crab- Pak ChoiThe restaurant was very busy when we arrived, which is always a positive sign, we had not booked but the staff were able to find us a table and seat us straight away. The pepper crab was too spicy for myself but other members of my party enjoyed it a lot. I really enjoyed the chilli crab, which tasted a little like hot and spicy soup. Most of us did not enjoy the cereal prawns as the texture and combination of sweetness seemed a little strange.The dishes come in small, medium and large portions- it is best to order small ( as these are still quite big!) so you can order more things to try! The bill was reasonable especially for the amount of food we ate
3
The seafood menu is expansive and even though the catch of the day is imported it seems fresh and tastes great. The whole crab is massive and can feed up to four people comfortably and there are plenty of add ons and sides to choose from. Thing is that it all adds up and you are left with a pretty hefty bill which is where the balance between portion and value takes a dive. It is worth the price simply for the experience of machete-ing your way through Singapore Chili Crab and/or Pepper Crab. The al fresco, chilled out, by the east coast atmosphere is alright but you could grab similar seafood experiences for a lot cheaper in Thailand, Sri Lanka, or Indonesia

Having travelled extensively over the years I feel TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED with our experience & how we were treated @ Jumbo's in the UDMC Seafood Centre. After having read many reviews as to where the best Chilli Crab was to be found in Singapore; my husband & I settled on Red House Seafood @ the UDMC centre. After recommendations from our Hotel(The Mandarin Oriental) we decided on Jumbo's, what a huge mistake!!!! A fair way out of town we didn't mind as my husband was really looking forward to the Crab. Once sitted we proceeded to place our order, we continually had to ask the waitress how long our drinks would take, minutes went passed whilst around us locals where being sitted and orders taken & delivered straight away. Our rice dish arrived but no Crab, we were then gived our bibs and waited earnestly whilst the Waitress milled around us continually ignoring us. After 1 hour we asked where our food was, by this time tables of locals around were starting to disipate only to be told another 10 mins. By this stage we were furious and had lost our appetite.The waitress acted surpised when we voiced our disappointment even thought she continually circled our table. To add salt to the wound they made us pay $27 for 1 beer, Water and rice.Talk about LOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE.I don't know what their problem was, maybe we were too well dressed!! Should have followed my first instinct & gone to Red House (less crowded, much nicer) Give this a wide berth as there are many other places that a better
4
Walking along Clark Quay at Singapore and asked if they had a vacancy. They were very booked up but fitted us in and the service was excellent. Our meal was outstanding. I am very impressed with Jumbo's and will eat here again next time we are in Singapore
5
We ate at Jumbo's 3 times in 5 days. Twice in East Coast and once in riverwalk area. The chilli and black peper crab are the best in Singapore. Service is out standing. Call ahead and reserve a big crab 1.5-1.7KG and enjoy. No place better too eat in Singapore
4
Booking in advance is a must, especially on weekends. But that does not means you will get a table once you arrive at the restaurant! There will still be many people waiting for a table despite prior reservations made, but you have to wait longer without one. (I really don't understand how the restaurants take reservations and what for!) Anyway, despite the wait, it is still worth going to this East Coast branch - for the sea view! For dinner, go slightly earlier when there is still sunlight and desk for an outdoor table. Chilli crab (not spicy at all), fried buns, sambal kangkong, scallop yam rings are worth trying
3
Jumbo is famous for its chili crab. I somehow not really appreciate chili crab as I prefer salted egg crab and others. However, I like the chili crab gravy to serve with fried bun, that is the best part I like about chili crab.I went to Jumbo Clarke Quay and Changi side. The food generally nice but a bit pricey for me. We had company lunch there with their set lunch with 8 courses. Most food like lobster salad, the vegetables, dessert all quite standard and good
4
This is one of the Must Do's of singapore. Excellent chilli crab quick service modest cost good food. Ambience is a what one would expect in the touristy restaurant in high season but we got a table as soon as we got there- not a very nice table but as a bunch of guys we were only interested in the food . The food did not disappoint. Ate our fill for $60- for 3 hearty eater
5
I love the black pepper jumbo crabs, taro with scallop, bamboo clams, etc.
A compulsory stop for dinner whenever I have friends from abroad and my Mum and Sister's birthday celebration yearly.
4
Food was about average for Singapore, but the location is great, with a view of the Singapore Straight. Service was fast and efficient.
5
There are so many kinds of sea foods. my favorite fish, sea bass. Prawns, crabs and yummy.............................
4
Crowded during the weekend and dinner time. However, was quickly seated and we ordered curry crab (850grams) and scallop with brocolli. The crab was so fresh and huge. Scallop was also huge and fresh. Remember to order the small little fried bread for the crab. Dip it with the curry crab sauce and eat it while hot. Bill came at $80+ which is so cheap if you do not do the conversion. Imagine yourself working at SG and you will definitely think it is cheaper. I will definitely go back to try the crab again
5
After relishing the chilli crab at their Riverwalk joint, one was curious to know if the East Coast outlet would match. Glad to say they did in every respect. We were a largish (4 + 2 kids) party and had landed up at the peak evening hour without a reservation. The staff were very understanding and arranged a table for us (including two baby chairs) in quick time. The jumbo chilli crab was delicious (and the crackers helped us reach the meat from the toughest shells). The other dishes were equally tasty, particularly the You Tiao and the steamed bun. The ambience was great as well, although we did not get a table outdoor which was closer to the Straits view. A memorable evening
4
On the waterfront in Clarke Quay, we were first time Singapore visitors... service was good, and bill was around $110SGD for half a kilo of the chili crab, generous serving of fried rice, and some shrimp. Very happy for a no fuss chili crab experience... recommended
5
Jumbo Seafood along the East Coastal Parkway is excellent in every way. The crab cooked Singapore style is second to none. Waitstaff pays great attention to service. It is best to have a reservation as the restaurant gets full everytime but walk ins are welcome. We went straight from the airport carrying our luggage and all but alas we were not the only ones. Several customers had the same idea!This is an open restaurant with half the tables outside the covered area. Stay in the open area for more enjoyable view of the ocean. The beach/ seawall is a mere 10 yards away.Although the seafood is the main fare, the restaurant also offer different menu like chicken, duck, pork, and beef.Our typical order, crab Singapore style, fried rice, bamboo clams, kailan steamed vegetable, drunken shrimp, and a pitcher or two of Tiger beer. Now you can call that a night
3
I really wanted to try this as it was fully booked last time I was in Singapore. Made a reservation 10 days before for a Friday night but still got a poor table too close to other diners. Staff were rushed but friendly. I've had much better black pepper crab elsewhere in Singapore. Wine and dessert selection really poor
4
i like the casual atmosphere, the food is tasty and excellent. service is not much to brag about but you don't go to a place like this for service. you go simply for the food. chilly crab is a must, deep fried baby squid is a good starter and the bamboo clam is highly recommended. there was a roast chicken dish with crispy skin (which I can't quite remember the name) that was particularly good
4
I After reading passionately mixed reviews, I was a bit hesitant about this place, but ended up being very pleased. Chili crab was excellent (but I actually found the black pepper crab even tastier). Nice outdoor setting with a neat view of the Straits. Definitely worth a visit
1
I don't really know what happen to this Restaurant. We usually went here for family gathering dinner when my dad was still around. But the last time we went there, the food taste so bad that i can't figure out why this restaurant still survive.
5
excellent location and beautiful set up..the staff is very good and courteous..the food is amazing and the presentation is good..the chilli carb is very yummy and top quality..shrimps i had were best ever i had..overall would like to visit this place again when in singapore.
4
After you manage to get a table, your meal will be wonderful!
The must tries are black pepper and chilly crab.
One trick is to insist on getting your prawns unshelved so that you get all the taste you expect!
5
Excellent service and generous portions. We had chili crab, egg fried rice and garlic shrimps. Yummy!
3
Some of the dishes is good like kang kong belachan, steam prawns, chili crab.
Serving size very small. Make sure you tell them no chili if you can't take spicy.
3
A colleague/business partner took me to this restaurant for dinner. He did all the ordering. He ordered a black pepper crab, broccoli with scallops, some kind of prawn in crumbs or something, and some kind of stir fried noodle. I gotta say the black pepper crab was AWESOME! The broccoli with scallops was OK, not the best, but OK. The prawn thing was... interesting, fairly good. The noodle was also OK, again, not the best stir fried noodle, but OK.The best feature of the restaurant is definitely the view! Very nice view of the water. Quite pricey too actually
3
the Jumbo seafood franchise chain has grown from just 1 corner at UDMC Seafood Centre (now just known as East Coast seafood centre) in the early 80's to many outlets found in many prime tourists &/or shipping districts.in order to have fast turnover of food & customers, many of the favourite dishes are pre-cooked and re-heated; just like another of Singapore's favourite local high cholesterol larded dishes char kway teowJumbo augment staff with hotel & hospitality students from northern China attached on internship basis.in some respects, many foreign & local guests are oblivious to fact that seafood at most of these white linen table cloth food franchise outlets (the other being Long Beach & NO SIGN BOARD; yup even that is a local brand name) have become nothing more than fast food sea food served on white linenironically, the best seafood are located at outlets attached to food courts found in many of Singapore's public housing estates (HDB)these restaurants rely on repeat business & dare not cut corners. penny pinching residents of public housing in Singapore make sure they are getting their monies' worth.one added benefit is that there is no 7% Goods & Services tax at these mom & pop sea food restaurants; the beer is also cheaper than served at restaurant chain
2
Decided to dine here for lunch on the recommendation of the chatty taxi driver (who was actually quite nice and an encyclopedia of information, thanks Simon!) We arrived at 1:45 p.m. and was told the restaurant closes 2:30 sharp. We were hurried to the outside table, order was placed promptly, but did not arrive until 2:20 p.m. Prior to that peanuts were on the table, as well as hot tea which we gladly devoured prior to the arrival of the meal. Food was so so, certainly nothing special as I have had better tasting chili crab in the heart of Westminister, CA! The rib eye was not even warm and the noodles were mediocre. The restaurant appears to cater to the unsuspecting tourist, as I noticed all foreigners eating there. The bill came while we were still eating and the cashier said we had to pay NOW, not exaggerating, as the sales for the lunch had to be taken care of. And to top it off, to my utter surprise we were charged for both the tea, which was sitting on the table when we arrived and which we didn't ask for it AND the peanuts (we asked for a second heaping of while waiting for our meal). Totally ridiculous and instead of complaining, which it appears the staff wouldn't have cared if we did or not, our party left and fortunately, will never return or recommend
5
We'd be warned earlier in the day by the restaurant manager that there was little hope of getting a table and it was booked out a couple of days in advance. Lucky for us, when we rocked up with our six month old baby in his buggy a lovely waitress gave us practically the best table in the house - right on the waterfront. Pretty obvious tip, but order the chilli crab
4
Mostly are tourists best eat out place. Irregardless, on weekday or weekends, it's always pack and crowded. The favorite place is sitting at the walkway (with night windy ambience). Pre-booking is required to ensure seats available.Well, food menu serve with ala-carte or courses. The signature dish is Chilly Crabs and seafood. Best eat with hands peeling off the skin of prawns and crabs. The restaurant serves all types of cooking style with different sauces. Crabs, Prawns and Fish are the best serving foods. Try it, you'll love it
5
It is a very famous restaurant with local seafood. The cooking of king crab is very interested. You can have many choices. Have to give it a try.
4
I was lucky to go for lunch with my Singaporean friend - so he did all the ordering. Not only were the crabs delicious and meaty but the special clams he ordered were lovely too.
3
It does a service for the nation's famous dish -chilli crab. There are other dishes one shoould order. Seafood servings of different assoretment are safe bets.
4
Positive:
- location
- atmosphere
- food quality
- bonus vouchers if Ur paying with AMEX
Negative:
- value, size of dishes and price level (around $80 per person: soup, main dish and beer)
- long line
- extra fee for nuts, tea etc..!!!!
2
This place is just overrated. Chili Crab was not tasty @ all. The mantao is tastier without the sauce. What is great disappointment. Their salted egg yolk prawns is pretty much a let down too.
4
Jumbo seafood restaurant, is good but serving size very small compare to other restaurants around. Tried it once if have not eaten there before but try some others as well so you can compare the taste. Pepper crab at Jumbo, I don't care for it because of butter flavor. I've tried few restaurants there and seems to me they are focusing on tourists. If you are happy to pay for it than why not..

This is one of the better seafood restaurant chains to go for good seafood, like Chilli Crab. Do visit the eatery at East Coast, where you chill out on a verandah while watching the sunset, and tucking into sambal kangkong (vegetables), crispy small squids and chilli or black pepper crab. We also like the eatery at Dempsey Road. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends
4
As usual, the chilli crab was delicious!One criticism I have is that when I made the reservation over the phone, I wanted to reserve a table for the Jumbo Seafood directly opposite Clarke Quay, near Brewerkz etc (at Riverside Point) and yet our table reservation ended up being at the other restaurant, further down the river with no view. Very disappointing as this has happened on two occasions
3
The quality of raw materials and cooking is pretty good here, but the service may make you choose staying at home and cooking noodles for yourself.The pepper crab was excellent, the garlic crab was good, but too sweet. The rest of the experience was hurried and uncomfortable
3
Jumbo seafood is in a good location, near the Boat Quay. Food is good and not so expensive (for Singapore). I tryed the fried rice and some noodles and everything was good. Service is good and fast. Ask for an external table because the inner room is very cold
3
The famous Chili crab is Just reguler. The sauce is too sweet. Maybe the recipe already customized with western taste. Prefer the Pepper crab. Tastier.... The baby squid is too salty. Overall nice place with regular food taste.
4
The selection of food here is amazing, they literally have everything. Very popular with the locals too!
Always make a reservation were possible as they are always busy.
3
Who would have known it would have been so messy? But the chilli crab was really tasty! It was cool that we got an apron with a crab picture on it! The coconut juice was YUM!
5
to do this properly, arrive early ath UDMC on the East coast and wait for a table, preferably facing the sea.
deep fried baby octopus is great and YOU MUST have the pepper or chili crabs.
no choice - this is a singapore MUST DO!!!
5
I've gone here on every visit to Sinagpore. I love the Peoper Crab there as well as various other shrimp and crab dishes. Both locations are in the middle of a great atmosphere.

If you are a seafood freak; and in Singapore then Jumbo probably is the first place to target. I find the chilli crab rather overrated so would recommend digging your hands into the pepper crab. There is a venison and soy dish which you can also try with fresh steamed buns . Now lets get to the bad part; the service. While the Service at East Coast is okay and you get the food on time without any personal touch, the service at Indoor Stadium is appalling. We went there on a Monday evening ..waited over 90 minutes for our order but the staff was just no interested. They were screaming at each other over their headsets and sounding extremely busy but guess what to no avail. Infact after speaking to at least 5 people, we gave up and left. The staff was least interested and rather happy to have a table free. At a minimum of $300 for a meal for two this place really needs to focus on its service as much as its food. The Chef story is great ....but the service way below basic standards -loud, brash and not in the least personal
5
A Complete Seafood haven !!! Lots of variety and great quantity served...Black Pepper Crab was simply superb and out of the world....Have it to experience it !!!Must try place...located very conveniently @ Clarke Quay and do try to reserve your tables if you go in the evenings (after 8 pm)
4
This place does absolutely amazing chilli crab. Delicious! I have seen it in many other restaurants but nowhere it looks as good as at Jumbo's. The service however is poor. We waited ages for our drinks and side dishes and at the end we got charged for peanuts and chinese tea they offer when you sit at your table but which we didn't have. But if you want to try really good chilli crab this is the place to go
3
Now be sure from the offing, that the singapore king crab is not worth the hype, its a lot of shell and sauce, a lot of work for not that much flesh. But break past that and youve actually got a pretty good menu here, the black pepper king crab is miles better than the over sweet singapore king crab staple and the sizzling seafood noodle dishes are actually pretty good - clean flavours trumping through. Service is a bit shoddy but then again we went on a Friday night and the place was packed. Anyhow its one of those must do in Singapore things so just jump in and try diffrent things out, you wont leave unhappy but you wont be blown away either. One last trick there are 5 Jumbo Seafood outlets in Sing, each with its own style and scene so check the one thats fit for your purpose beforehand. Nothing is far away in Sing ;
4
If in Singapore and into seafood, Jumbo East Coast is a must. Given its popularity, you have to expect it to be quite busy and fully booked, so make sure you have reservation. One thing you shouldn't miss is the Chilli Crab, the inofficial Singapore national dish. But whatever dishes you go for, you will not be disappointed. As often, the best approach will be to just order some stuff to be shared by your group
4
One of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore,
Pepper crabs are a must eat in Jumbo
4
I like the chilli crabs best though the pepper crabs was not too bad. The gravy was delicious and it tasted so good with pieces of bread soaked in it.
5
Not much to say except excellent chilli crab, and good service. Booking prior to arrival is a must as you may be turned away. Enjoy!
4
I have eaten at this restaurant a couple of times in the past and yet again this time the seafood served was fresh and freshly prepared and well done. The location is very good with seats on the riverside for those who fancy it. The prices are quite exorbitant and I guess this is in keeping with the fact that the location (clarke quay) mainly caters to tourists. I am yet to try the other outlet on East Coast that finds a mention and recommendations and will do that during my next visit
3
Food is generally good but i felt rushed throughout my dinner. We usually dine at Long Beach which we are regulars but this was a friend's treat. Personally feel the standard has dropped since it use to be at serangoon gardens and we we loyalty card members then. But its still a good place to have local seafood, try the black pepper crab but watch it, can be a bit spicy cause the load it
5
This place is huge and VERY busy!! I'm not sure if you can book or not but we got a table without booking on a night that they appeared packed. The menu is extensive and full of a variety of seafood delights, and the singapore chilli crab is sensational. We took our 2 boys (aged 8 and 9) who are not all that keen on trying new and different things, but we found lots for them to eat. Easy to find if you take a taxi, they all know Jumbos East Coast. Also too, the view is amazing at night with hundreds of cargo ships waiting to get into the docks, the whole horizon is lit up with lights and looks like another city over the water. There is a great path to walk along and the foreshore is full of restaurants.
2
Does no one smile in this town ? We were told that Sunday night is Jumbo night, so we caught a cab to the East Coast. We had booked so our table was ready for us, but the waiter seem to have had his sense of humor removed, wuold not make eye contact and was kind of robotic.Anyway we ordered our chilli mud crab, it was huge and it was excellent. We had some buns that were warm and crunchy while still soft inside. A few Tiger beers and we were done in under an hour. The check arrived quicker than a speeding Ferrari (!), we paid the bill (around $250 for 2) and left, feeling somewhat underwhelmed and ripped off
5
Everything available Jumbo size. Best is chilli crab and eating it in the ever green weather of Singapore. Its the best food experience i had outside my hometown. The ambience of the restaurant and the variety of sea-food from shrimps to prawns to jumbo prawns. From crab to Lobsters, you name it, and you have it
4
I have been to Jumbo's on the East Coast twice and both times had a good experience. I wouldn't say that service is perfect, or the food is always amazing... but service and food are consistently good and the crab is delicious. One caution: Although they may tell you they have a few vegetarian options, they actually have a very poor selection. Even the sauce on the steamed vegetables (a 'vegetarian' dish) has some form of seafood
3
One has to find chili crab before one leaves the island of Singapore, and there is no better place to make the dive, then at Singapore institution, Jumbo seafood. There are multiple locations and we decided to return to an old favorite, on East Coast parkway. The setting is ourdoor and noisy. the atmosphere a mix of calamity and and confusion. Despite all of the thrashing, noise and energy, they sling out some tasty seafood. The beer lady is constantly circling to make sure cold jugs of Tiger beer keep flowing. A satay woman will drive by to see if you want to get off the fish plan, but stay focused on the goal, and that is a plate heaping to overflow with chili crab and the less messy partner, pepper crab. This meal isn't for the faint of heart or taste. it is bold, spicy and messy. Get ready to dive in and don't spare on the wet wipes to keep pace with the mess.It's open air, with some fans to keep it moving, and that sweat you will experience isn't just from the cilmate. The spices kick in and you are chasing it with Tiger beer to keep the fire in check. it's great fun, not cheap and far from fine dining, so bring a sense of humor and keep at it until you can't take anymore. Don't wear white!!A couple of tips, be ready for a long taxi line wait at the end, or book one in advance with a pickup time. Even with a reservation, it is pretty chaotic, as we had to wait a half hour after our reservation time. There didn't appear to be much rhyme or reason as to how things work, so relax and soak in the scene
5
Chili crab is worth the visit. Good service. Go with a informal dress as you may splatter some curry on your dress!
5
A must for any visitor to Singapore! Can't miss Chilli Crabs, Pepper Crabs and Prawn Cereals!
5
The Singapore Chilli crabs are amazing and is a dish everyone must try in Singapore. It is reasonably priced and is delicious
3
the food good we had lobster its was good but not wow. ok not bad for cfood.
4
I have to say this is pricy as hell at least to me... but it is one of the best seafood restaurants I have ever been to in Singapore. The food was nicely cooked, with good service.
5
had dinner there every night...
can't help 2 coming back again n again...even if we have to wait 4 table in weekend time coz it's very full.
but still we think it's the best place 2 eat chili crab in s'pore
5
This was really nice on the water lots to choose from on the menu. If you are not sure where to get Chili Crab go to Jumbo.
5
I liked the Chili King crabs, best eaten with fried mantou. :) The place is also great, specially located on the bay area. :)
4
I have never been to Singapore so when the day came that I visited my Chinese friend based in Singapore, I was very excited of what food to try in this concrete jungle in Asia. Highly recommended by my friend is the national dish--Chilli crab is a must try! So where else to go? I just found myself in this area near the riverside where my friend brought me and I'm hanging out with my other good friend--where else? at JUMBO seafood restaurant! I wouldn't disagree with what is everybody is saying about the bun. You must have it! Aside from that we had which is the usual order of Chili crab, the rest of the food were good. I can't remember any bad memory about dissatisfaction in any of their food but the taste that highly resonate to my palette and brain were the buns and chilli crabs! The order came a bit late because there are many people but when you are dining out and eating with good friends with the view of the river, you will hardly notice the time. I must say this place is really worth your money for its taste, now I am a no curious dudette when it comes to what a good Chilli crab is!!
3
The crab was classic. Great way to entertain friends from out of town without the risk of being embaressed... but really, the food all tastes like it is prepared to a formula... it's uniform. There is no soul to the cooking.Get your tourist friends to try the chilli crab.I won't eat there on my own except when having to entertain
5
Great fresh food, efficient and reasonable prices for the quality. Definite yes.
4
Delivers what it promises: decent seafood at reasonable prices.
3
Had big expectation about this seafood place. However didn't find it very exciting. Many seafood dish are sweet, which I do not prefer. Overall nice place but nothing fancy. No idea about the cost because I didn't pay the bill.
5
I especially love the one on the East Coast. Its just fabulous eating really good Chinese food beside the ocean. I heart you Jumbo!
5
This is a place to eat seafood....especially chili crab. Go ahead, wear a bib, roll your sleeves up, and eat with your hands. There's really no way that's not messy!You can make reservations, but I couldn't get anyone to answer the phone. I go at dusk, so that the lights of the seemingly endless wall of ships sitting offshore become visible as we eat. It's not only chili crab, but lots of other choices, including vegetables. I like to sit outside, along the front. Get there early because those seats go fast.If I'm in Singapore 3-5 days, one night is always set aside for a trip out the East Coast Parkway to Jumbo
3
The food was great, which is why I didn't give it a poor rating. But in terms of a real sized feed? I'm not sure if we Australians eat too much in one sitting but my Mum's Rib Eye Steak was a small chop, and her side salad was a slice of cucumber topped with half of a cherry tomato. The setting is nice, and the establishment itself is very well presented. The crab was great and the bibs gave us all a bit of a giggle. We had 2 servers, one of whom was nice and smiley, the other was average and looked as if she didn't want to be there. Long wait for meals
5
This place was a once in a lifetime eating experience. Loved the mess, the tea dip and all of the flavors of this one of a kind eatery. The small chili crab and pepper crab along with the seafood fried rice was more than two could handle at this Singapore waterfront attraction. All of the servings were fresh and delicious. We hardly spoke for the first 20 minutes because we were so busy picking apart our crabs and staring at the South China Sea cargo ships. We ate while the sun went down. Show up early (6pm ish) or get a booking as we weren't the only ones with a craving for crab. Reject the peanuts and the tea as they will charge for it and the other food is plenty filling. Of course my husband had tears roll down his face from the chili spice... however, spice is nice. Close cab ride from airport.. Must go to this place even if in Singapore for 4 plus hour layover. Worth every cent. Servers were fantastic
3
Went with a group of colleagues for a Saturday night dinner. Ordered chili crabs, Hong Kong noodles, Mantou, cereal prawns and steamed grouper. Made reservations, arrived on time, but had to wait 15 minutes for a table.Service was friendly but rote. You get nickel and aimed, so beware (paper towels, the peanuts on the table and the tea). The food arrived hot and was quite tasty (the noodles deserve special mention, the crabs are good, but I won't queue up for it). The quantity was adequate and we were all quite full at the end of the meal.Price was expectedly high (around S$300) for the feast which left us stuffed
4
I always try to drop in here when flying via Singapore, even if I only have a few hours between planes at the airport. The Chilli Crab alone is worth the trip there and back.The place is always busy but service is always very good and the food is the best. I particularly like the crispy fried seaweed, Scollops in Yam Rings and of course the Chilli Crab...also try the King Prawns in Salad cream served in a Golden Basket of deap fried noodles...its great tooThe view is of the river and bars is good to and its an excellent place to start your evening if your into a bit of bar hopping.Beware thow like many things in Singapore an meal here is not cheap, expect to pay about US$70+ for two courses and drinks
2
We went there on a Monday evening and the place was packed. We ordered 2 beers, asparagus with garlic, broccoli with garlic, deep fried baby squid and shrimp. They forgot the beer, brought the broccoli first, and then it took about 10 minutes for each separate dish to arrive. They clearly saw that we were unhappy but did not seem to really care. At the end, they brought us the wrong bill with a credit card from another customer! The food itself was average, did not like the baby squid that was crispy and caramelised. Very strange. Needless to say that I would not recommend this restauramt and would not go back there
5
An awesome restaurant with the best crabs I have ever had. Got a table next to the river and had a ball. Such a great location and great food, I would go back again in an instant !
3
Food here is not too bad, but be careful of the expensive price, especially if you were to order seafood selling by weight
4
Very good chilli and pepper crab, good ambience but they do try to rush you through
5
a bona fide Singapore experience. Delicious spicy crab dishes.
4
Chili Crabs, chilled fruit desserts, and a blend of East and West
4
This place is huge and the service depends on the mood of the waiter at that time as management has no chance to oversee what is going on. Were lucky on the night and had a good time. Large group and atmosphere was dynamic. Food is very good - not sure about the price as noththing in Singapore is cheap. Although it is out of the way its easy to catch a cab there and back into town. Has some ambience withg the best tables looking out onto the water - particularly nice at last light. There are several other places nearby if you can't get a table here so the trip is never a waste
4
The Chilli crabs and fried buns at Jumbo have to be the best @ Singapore! The dish is spicey with a sweet touch, the crabs fresh and meaty. Be prepared to ask for the price and weight of the crabs before you order.The place is over croweded to make sure you get there early or be prepared to wait a bit if you dont have reservations.There are quite a few Jumbos in Singapore... the one at clark Quey is quite crowded
5
The food is delicious! We had shark fine soup, sweety tiger prawns and crabs in a chilii souce. Everything was perfect.Only problem is because of too much popularity, the place is overcrowded and you literaly sit next to your neighbors and hear their conversation. Beer comes in big juice jars (not so nice) and towards the evening, the beer is not so cold. I guess, it is because too many people order beer and they simply dont have time to cool it.I recommend very much this place to visitors, who want to have a lot of seafood
5
What a treat! Such good food. Service is a bit abrupt, but overall friendly. We have been happy with the quality of the food every time we have been to Jumbo. And, always happy with our choices. Chili Crab and Pepper Crab are wonderful. Completely different and no one can seem to decide on one they prefer more:
4
This restaurant is big, of that there is no doubt, outside and inside eating areas. However, that said, the service generally is prompt, and above all the food is good. I have eaten here many times over the years, and the standard has remained pretty constant. There is a wide variety on the menu, and of course the signature dish of Singapore, Chilli Crab. I dont usually eat crab or lobster, but I am happy to get in and get dirty for Chili Crab, its good. The bread rolls (for want of a better term) served with the crab have reduced in size over the years, so expect to order more. You dip these into the sauce, heavenly. Overall, the location is pleasant, on the sea front, and on a nice evening very cooling. It can be crowded, so its advisable to book, and get an outside table on a nice night
5
OMG! The BEST chilli crab ever,,do not miss eating here! ALL the food is fabulous...great position too on Clarke Quay.
5
I'm recommended Curry Crab and Prawn Cornflakes. Don't mis its
4
We love the black pepper crab and eating it outside by the sea is the best!
4
Had dinner after work with colleagues and we were able to keep our reservation even though we were late. I enjoyed the chili crab and was similar to the lobster recipe's in Orange County. It was messy, but a lot of flavor. 2 days later, I was in Clark Quay and wanted to check out their other seafood dishes, but it was quite crowded and the wait was too long.
4
For us Westerners the menu was a bit daunting, large and complicated, so we simplified things by choosing a set menu for four which included Chili Crab. We added on some noodles, and there was loads to eat, all delicious. The crab was the star.This was recommended by a Singaporean friend here in London - I wish she had been with us to take us through the menu, and we would have arrived a little earlier in the evening; there was a lot of disruptive clearing of tables and disjointed service. Food great, though
4
I came there to celebrate new year eve with my family, the place is little bit far from orchad, it is in east side of Singapore.When I arrived, I thought, whooaa...what a big seafood restaurant..and many people in there.The food is okay, we ordered chilli crab, the famous food in Jumbo and other foods.For me, Compare to Jakarta"s seafood, Jakarta is better than Singapore.It just my opinion
3
I was taken to Jumbo Seafood by a local business colleague and whilst the food and service was OK, the overall experience and quality is very average. This place is a 'get them in and get them out' tourist type restaurant where they seem to trade off a reputation that is poorly founded.Whilst the food is OK it is nothing inspiring and Singapore has so much better to offer, usually at a better price. The service is much the same, the place seems to have an endless supply of customers and the service aligns with this
4
Went to Jumbo Riverwalk, after our concierge (kudos to Ritz Carlton staff) made great efforts to get us a last minute (Friday night) reservation. Finally got there and got our appointed table for two. After seating and ordering wine, we got a text from our local friend that they were finishing their own dinner but wanted to drop by and see us (it was our last night in Singapore) at the restaurant. Although the restaurant was very busy, we explained to the Manager and he said not to worry as he would do his best. While the restaurant was organized chaos, within the next few minutes, he came back a couple times to explain where/what he would do to accommodate our friends. We got moved quickly and with little fuss - we ordered, greeted and enjoyed - our friends, Black Pepper Crab, Cereal Prawns and more. For a busy restaurant, service was helpful, prompt and very accommodating. Food - awesome! Definitely recommend this restaurant
3
I've had the chilli crab a few times, which is good, if a little on the sweet side. Other than that I don't like the food here. But the restaurant is always full, which means they are doing something right. It's very expensive and touristy ($40 min for the chilli crab). I do enjoy Asian food (Thai, Indonesian and some Chinese). But I find this menu very Chinese without compromise to westerners, so if you enjoy that, you will probably enjoy this restaurant. The setting is quite nice
4
Had dinner here with 16 people and the organizer ordered a variety of dishes. Black peppered crabs and chilli crabs, roasted chicken, butter prawns, couple of fishes, loads of other dishes and a continuous flow of wine and beer. Came to 75 dollar each so not bad for a long dinner out. Service was fast and efficient albeit not overly friendly but would definitely recommend for a tasty and fun night out. Looking back the crabs were very good
4
The service is a bit poor but the food is grate... Specially the chilli crab which is a signature dish in Singapore
Best regards
4
There are many opinions, but I think Jumbo has the best chilli crab. It's consistently good regardless of which branch you go to.
3
It was OK but I wasn't keen on chilli crab! The scallops and ribs were OK though. Service a bit slow and grumpy!
4
I ate here for my Birthday! It's is really good, I like the chili crab and the mee goreng!
4
Must try item is the chilli crabs. The other seafood items are yummy too... only grouse is the price... :)
1
Only if the company is paying for it and you got an expense account! Too expensive, out of the way, hard to get taxis. Can get the same fare anywhere in town.
4
You can have crab in places in Singapore even Jumbo as a sea food chain has many outlets in the City. But this is where you wanna come: Jumbo East Coast. Come at night, take a seat on the terrace to get the fresh sea breeze, order chili crab AND black pepper crab (two good things always better than one good thing), Chinese buns (bread), lots of beer (don't waste your time with wine, beer goes much better with spicy food) and this is it! You can add freely other Chinese dishes but essentially you would come for the crab. Prepare to get dirty as the only way to eat it is with your fingers. Finish with fresh cut mangos or fruits. Shorts and T-shirts a must. Delicious, simple, fresh, exotic...and reasonably priced.
4
I went to the outlet at East Coast Park, been there twice. I have heard its the best among other outlets. Have not tried the rest though. I would suggest to try the chili crab. The seafood over at Jumbo is very fresh and price is more affordable than other places, especially in town areas. Most dishes are worth to try. Will be back there soon
3
We were told about the Chili Crab, on the trip over and the taxi driver from the airport told us it was a must. He even told us we would return to Singapore just for the Chile Crab! So the next day we went to Jumbo, large restaurant, at the Seafood Park. It was easy to get to. Subway to Bedok, bus 196 to Marine Park and a short walk. Jumbo does not open before 17:00, so we walked around. At 17:10 we walked in and were seated right away. Our first impression was that we were bothering them by coming this "early". We were seated inside first but changed our mind and asked to be seated outside. No problem. We ordered Chili Crab and were told it would take up to forty minutes, that was fine, we also ordered a jug of beer. They bring to the table without asking if it is desired, a half handful of peanuts and chinese tea, and they charged for both of them, peanuts S$1.20, tea S$2.40, The Chili Crab came in about 20 minutes. Well this is one messy meal to eat. The crab is covered in the chili sauce and you have to crack the crab yourself. OK, I will admit, this is not my favorite way to eat. The waitress never suggested that we order the buns to soak up the sauce, so we had to use the soup spoons on the table, the sauce lacks the spices described in tourist books, it tasted like a red chili thai sauce diluted in water or tasteless broth with a thickener, no big deal. The crab was good, but over rated and over priced. Price tag for a small crab and a jug of beer: S$79., we got much better meals in Chinatown for a fraction of the price. However, great location by the beach and we were glad that we came and at least tried it. We will return, but not for the Chili Crab
5
this is the 1st place where i ever ate CRab outside !!! and it was just aweSome...their CRab is their Signature dish there....so try it !!! I ate black pepper crab and fish with white rice... 2 of us and we only paid $80... it was damn worth it...cos the crabs were big !!!
4
Visited with 30 other people and staff plus food were amazing, beer was expensive but normal for Singapore
5
crab was just fantastic. service great and location magnificent,highly recommended
5
Go with a group, as there is a lot of food. Try both chili crap and pepper crab. The little sweet rolls are great to lap up the great sauces. Really good seafood. Take a lot of hand-wipes, your hands will get messy!
4
Very fresh Lobster.
The chilli crab is awesome, not to be missed.
5
Local delights and fresh seafood, every outlet has consistent quality. Great place to hang out at with families & friends. Must trys include: Chilli crabs and mantou (small dipping buns), Drunken prawns and steam groupa.
1
Having visited this restaurant on a previous visit to Singapore when we enjoyed the food and tolerated the indifferent service a return visit seemed to be in order. After being seated a 15 minute wait occurred before we even ordered, not a promising start. We opted for the set lunch menu with the items arriving in no particular order and each being served by a different member of staff. Between the arrival of the various dishes our meal docket was checked by seemingly all the members of staff, which rather than improving the speed of service reduced it to a snails pace. If you eat here and I strongly advise that you donâ€™t I can confirm that the glass wall at the rear of the dinning room conceals tinned food, yes in a land where fruit and vegetables are in abundance this establishment uses the tinned variety and just how do I know that because midway through our meal a member of the kitchen staff arrived with a trolley which she duly placed beside our table and proceeded to load with said tinned fruit, hardly conducive to eating ambience. Set in the middle of a favourite tourist area one would have thought that communication between customers and staff would be important but so little effort was being made that the staff attitude was little more than dumb insolence. Prize for the worst member of staff clearly went to Winnis Yong who purporting to be the Duty Manager missed the opportunity to make amends. Spend your Singapore dollars wisely by avoiding this restaurant and eating elsewhere
4
It seems like this is a "must-do" whenever I have first-time visitors to Singapore and the black pepper and chili crab never disappoints. My favorite outlet is still the one in East Coast but I'm glad they have branches nearer to my home on the occasion when I am craving pepper crab
3
Came here with some new friends that I made in Vietnam. We ordered some deep fried squid which was good, fried rice which was nothing special, steamed grouper which was surprisingly pretty tasty, and chili crab which was tasty but I swear was the cause of my stomach not feeling so well late that night
4
If Chilli Crab & Black Pepper Crab is your thing...nothing beats a trip to Long Beach at East Coast Parkway. However if time is short then by all means go to Jumbo. I have been to both their outlets in Singapore and whilst the crab is not as good as Long Beach it is an acceptable alternative. Perhaps I am a little harsh as I have not tried any of their other food. The place is buzzing and always crowded. Be prepared to wait if you do not have a reservation. They must be doing something right. Generally you can walk back to your hotel, a good thing to help the food digest. And the seasonal fruit on ice is a winner..
4
I especially love their de-shelled cereal prawns! But of course, Jumbo, crab. My family and myself tried their chilli crab and butter crab. I like the first more - top it off with fried mini buns soaking in the sauce! The butter crab was interesting, but I grew sick of the taste after 2min or so. I'm not saying it is bad - its worth a try. Don't bother with the apron, it is fun
4
Loved the black pepper crab - cant remember the food we had before it now! Wouldn't recommend the salted egg crab though.
5
Food taste is very good, the service is excellent. Staffs are friendly to introduce me the dishes even though I am in a very shoddy attire.
1
It's just soul-less... they throw you onto a table, then a guy randomly puts a table cloth over ladies handbags?! No music, plates and cutlery crashing
We didn't even stay to order food. Would not go back here (Clarke Quay branch)
5
This is the place to go for crab. There are a couple of Jumbos in Singapore, we went to the restaurant at Clarke Quay and enjoyed our crab on the promenade. We also had crispy squid which excellent. It can be busy, to avoid disappointment you should consider ringing for a reservation
4
In singapore there are a few restaurants that are veritable institutions for serving up particular dishes. Jumbo is definitely one of the stalwarts when it comes to Chili crab and Pepper crab. Service is ok; depends on the particular outlet. Jumbo has several outlets across the island
5
This was my first time in Singapore and I wasn't going to go out without trying the crab. We had heard wonderful stories about Jumbo and East Coast Seafood in general, so me and a couple of friends decided to try it out. We ordered the Steamed, Chili and Black Pepper crab along with a whole fried fish and fried rice. The reputation that this place has is truly deserved. The chili crab was truly succulent, with the spices being just right and good overtones of garlic mixed in. Black Pepper was good, however the spices and especially the pepper was a bit much on the crab but still really good. The chili crab comes with the crab and curry so that after you are done with the crab, you can dip rice or steamed crab in that delectable curry and enjoy. The setting for the East Coast Food location is pretty much outside seating and at night time it can be pretty good. Overall really good Chili Crab, and if you are only stopping over in Singapore for two to three hours, this location is very close to the airport, so come out and enjoy

This place is incredibly busy, when we booked for 7.00pm we were told that we must be finished by 8.15pm.We had one of the fixed menus with the main course being the Sri Lanka chilli crab. The crab was sweet and moist with big pieces of meat in a lovely chilli sauce. Prawns in oatmeal were also good, but the rest of it was a little underwhelming.in summary I think this place is ok, the service was quite good without being excellent. The prices though are high

Located on the waterfront at East Coast amongst a complex of other restaurants. The surroundings are clean and organised, Jumbo is all open air - no airconditioning that I could see. Quite busy on a Friday night at 8pm. Service was reasonably quick if a bit erratic. We ordered Tiger beer about 6.75 Sing dollars for a large glass inc the sevice charge and GST, which is an appropriate price. Food however was very poor for the price. Example: a "platter" called "Jumbo Cold Dish" has 6 fried mini spring rolls (low-grade frozen type), about 6 medium size peeled prawns on a few slices of canned mango and mayonnaise, canned pickled octopus, and crumbed fried tofu (tasted ok). The serve size was enough for about one semi-hungry person and the price was about S$45 ! inc charges. If you think that price is appropriate then you will be quite happy here. In my experience of Singapore and elsewhere it was worth about $20 and even then it was such low quality food it wouldn't be worth going all the way to East Coast.In summary it is downmarket low-grade food at a price that warrants far better quality. One can easily get far better food for the price in Australia or Japan, both countries considered higher cost for eating out
4
We went on the night of our arrival in Singapore and loved the experience. However we didn't automatically get the right tools to eat the crab and were a little disappointed. Overall though a great experience and we went back a couple of weeks later and enjoyed much more
4
Chili or black pepper crabs are my favorite dish in Singapore. My friend who works there took me to this restaurant. Location wise, it's near to office premises. Therefore, reservation is a must.Four of us ordered one chili crab plus one black pepper crab, and of course our plates were clean! We also ordered the fried mantau which we enjoyed with the chili crab sauce. Tofu with mushroom is also good
3
This resto serves yummy Seafood for a price of an arm and a leg...
if you have extra pocket money, it is still worth it for a visit...
1
Terrible atmosphere, you will not feel welcome ! Some offers out of the menu not available. No option to get dessert as they try to get you out as quick as possible to free up the table for a new couple.
2
While the crabs served are indeed good, the service is just awful. We were not given crab crackers or small forks to get meat out even though other (local Singapore) customers did receive them we noticed as leaving. Very messy eating the crabs (which we knew in advance). Water glasses given to us were filthy. Service attention was non-existant
3
Heard a lot about the place from the locals. Went there for dinner. The foods pretty average , not impressive. The staff keeps very busy , so expect a long wait before you're served.Ordered their chilli crab , squid & dry prawns . All pretty average. The prices are pretty steep too.Place gets very busy during dinner , so you would have to wait maybe - an hour or more at times
4
I dont find anything special for this place. the food is just soso for me. the location is a bit off for tourist and those who dont have car. the price is not expensive. comparing to any other seafood restaurant like lei garden and no sign board. so, if you're planning to eat plenty of seafood without robbing your pocket, here is the place.
4
Service a bit hit and miss, but the food is wonderful. Try the chilli crab and wear a bib! Its fabulous and will leave you licking your fingers clean. Recommend the phoenix chicken too, which is a delightful mix of crispy chicken skin and fishcake. Sounds odd? Gotta try it
5
The Chili Crab here is excellent. Never fails to satisfy our cravings and hunger for a sumptuous crab meal. Perfect to pair with deep-fried mantou, tastier to swoop the chili sauce with this bread. Of course this restaurant is more than the chili crab dish, other dishes are feast to your taste buds as well. The service is real good, waiters/waitresses checks on your table from time to time. Kind of checking if you have dining needs like additional plates, utensils, etc. Simple services like tying the bib for you (if you ordered for crab) and covering your bag with a cloth should you place your bag on a vacant seat next to you (for safety purposes especially if you're seated in an alfresco set-up) are worth mentioning. Shows that the restaurant cares for the customer to have a good dining experience. It's a must try restaurant if you are in Singapore and wants to have a taste of the famous Chili Crab and other delectable dishes. Definitely recommended for a casual dining experience with family and friends

While not the most efficient Jumbo, we love the theatre of the East Coast location as they get the hordes fed. Sit back with a tiger beer (or two) and enjoy the show! The oil tankers twinkle almost romantically off the shore, and we enjoy the buzz around us.And eventually we are rewarded with food, though in reality you come to Jumbo for one thing and thats crab. We chose black pepper on this particular outing, was fantastic as always. Enjoyed also the fish fillets with ginger and shallot, and veges in garlic. Luckily you can order small portions to enjoy more dishes.While most likely capitalising on the tourist market, I do not begrudge what we pay for fine seafood prepared in local manner and a few jugs of Tiger beer while watching the world go by
4
Have visited for first time at Demsey hill,and found it great. Chili crabs were delicious,and black pepper crab not bad but not the one I prefer. It was extremely busy,seems its always like that so make sure you book well in advance particularly if it's weekend. Staff efficient and quick

We were very excited to try this restaurant as the location at Riverside was always jammed with people eating and having a good time. We did not have a good time.Singapore is a a great city to eat in. There are so many choices and most are really priced well. This Jumbo place was overpriced in our opinion.The service was not good. It seemed as if they were disorganized. We had at least 4 different people taking orders from our table. When we arrived, a waiter came to take our order. Five minutes later another waiter came to take out order as if we had not already placed our orders. During our meal, when we asked for more drinks, it took over 5 minutes to bring a soft drink. The most disappointing thing was the food. I tried to order three different dishes only to have the waiter return to the table telling me that they were out of the item... scallops, geoduck... they were out. A person at my table had ordered a mixed seafood dish served over rice, and it looked nice in the photo with several huge shrimp in the photo. When the meal arrived, there was very little seafood, only tiny pieces. When we complained that the dish was insufficient, they sent two people over to count the shrimp int he dish. When it showed that there were only a few tiny pieces or shrimp and almost no scallops, the manager didn't offer to bring a few more shrimp or remove the dish from our bill. Unbelievably, he brought the menu to us and showed the mall print that said that "Actual menu items may not look like the photos on the menu." That is OK, but they really didn't have any real seafood in the dish. At the end we simply refused to pay for the dish which was a big bowl of rice with some egg and they did remove it from the bill.Another man at our table had ordered the giant crab claw (spicy chili crab) which was a featured item and the reason this man had insisted that we go there. The price was around $50 SGD and when he finished he was still hungry and commented that the claw was small. The manager asked if he liked his meal and he said that it seemed small that there was very little meat. The manager agreed saying that the claws that day were very small. He didn't offer to bring something else or discount the price. There were some good things. I had a king prawn cheese bake for $14 SGD that was delicious and served perfectly. We also had some fried mini-buns which were tasty. We had two noodles with seafood dishes that were also very nice and delicious although one of these noodle dishes was not what we had ordered but we at it anyway because it was one of the better items on the table.Overall, I say to go somewhere else. There are many other dining options at Riverside
5
A must if you are in Singapore! Ordered the seafood fried rice, BBQ prawns, egg salted prawns, and of course the chili crab.
5
excellent meal, the river quay location seems to have the best food. service is hit and miss but when the food comes it makes it all worthwhile. definately must visit
4
Great food! Cereal prawns and Chili Crabs a must try. Also loved the cod fish. A bit expensive but worth it. Budget around S$50-100 per person. Will visit again when I go back to Singapore next time.
4
It's traditional seafood in Singapore. Wait staff very attentive and helpful. Place is usually packed, so it's not very "intimate". Feels like a big cafeteria. Food was pretty good...
4
I have dined at Jumbo Seafood Restaurant many times and have enjoyed each and every visit. On this occasion, I dined at the Riverwalk location, which is a beautiful location! The service is lacking at times, but the food is consistently good.
5
Many guide books recommend this restaurant in east coast, but that is far from the city and doesn't seem easy to be reached by tourist. So, we decided to go for their branch in Clarke Quay. Realized that this restaurant is fully booked at all time, we decided to book a table online two days before we arrived Singapore, and received their confirmation by email the next day.Our table was by the river, and the food was great. Must try the Black Pepper Carb if you like spicy food! Their fry-rice is also very good
5
This was my second visit to Jumbo, l also ate at Demsey Hill last year and had a nice meal so decided to try another more touristy destination at Riverside Point as l was entertaining friends. I made a booking in advance, they only hold your table for 15 minutes so beware. I arrived late due to heavy traffic and my taxi taking longer than expected for pick up. My table had in fact been given away, however l was asked to sit and wait and l did get my table back after 10 minutes and before my guests arrived. The food is excellent here, have the black pepper crab, not the chilli crab. I ordered both. We also ordered tofu with spinach skin and mushrooms, spinach, brocolli, asparagus, crispy chicken, seafood noodles, steamed fish, rice and soft drinks. It came to $50 per person which l thought was very reasonable. Service good and location and ambience great. They also gave 10% discount
4
didn't buy the branding, but tasted food served at every of its branches and it is one of the rare food chains that have a certain consistency in their delicacies. Prices are not universal due to the restaurants' rental which we could understand. But serves the better seafood and chilli crab on the island, from the range of restaurants that is. I'd recommend this
3
We had been led to believe Jumbo at Clarke Quay would be a world class restaurant, but at least at the time of our visit it was not particularly impressive. The wait staff seemed to be tired or upset at our arriving toward the end of the lunch rush. The place was pretty full when we arrived but tables were emptying quickly. The much heralded black pepper crab was good but actually not nearly as good here as at some of the simple food stalls in Singapore's Chinatown. We do not speak Chinese and felt that at times the staff did not understand our English. We did enjoy the fried baby squid. We also had lobster and it was tasty. One order we placed was completely forgotten and we were brought an extra pitcher of beer which we did not order. When we informed the head waiter that we had ordered only one pitcher he acted as though he did not understand us. It was included on the bill and was only removed after a hassle at the cashier's desk
3
We went to that Riverside restaurant on Sunday 5:30pm, and ask a table for two person. They said there is full if we haven't reserve before, then we ask to check the other branch at Riverwalk, they said same condition. We are so surprise there have too many people like this restaurant. We don't comment the food cause we don't try it, but we suggest to make the reservation first
5
We love going to this place. The seafood is fresh and delicious.
5
we ate here on one night ..had to make a booking the day before to ensure we had a table..very popular ..the crab was fantastic
Recommend to anyone that enjoys seafood ..bit pricy that worth the cost
4
the best place to take visitors for Singapore seafood. a couple of great locations.
4
It really is good. Of course you have to try the Chili Crab, Singapore's favorite dish. Don't overlook the Black Pepper Crab as well. Go as a group, and get them both. Reason why it isn't a perfect five is because Red House and Long Beach are better (competitors). Favorite location is the Clarke Quay restaurant
3
We love chilli crab and usually eat it on Clarke Quay or Newton food court, but someone recommended Jumbo as the best place in S'pore. We invited the family of our friends to join us and, while the crab was sweet and delicious, the evening was ruined by the extremely slow service. The Supreme Fried Rice and vegetables came at least an hour before the crab. Then one order of steamed crab arrived. This was entirely finished before we snared the waitress to demand where the two chilli crabs had got to. She said 15 minutes more. By this time everyone was bored so we told her to cancel them. She then insisted they were just coming out of the pot. We had to wait another 20 minutes before they arrived. Sure they were good, but the wait was far too long. Total bill for 6 persons with just the 3 crabs, one rice dish and one vegetable dish was over $200. Very disappointing. But if you still want to try it, make sure you reserve a table in advance
4
The classic Singaporean seafood restaurant with the famous chili crab which in my opinion is largely overrated (the chili crab not the restaurant which is very good). I much prefer their black-pepper crab which is just awesome.Booking in advance is recommended. There are 2 restaurants in Clarke Quay and 1 in the East Coast Park (original one)
5
I was recommended this was the place for Singapore Chilli Crab and I wasn't disappointed. Make sure you try the little dinner rolls to soak up the gravy. Also, the cereal prawns and egg prawns are fantastic. Wash it all down with a Singapore Sling :-
4
My friends brought me to Jumbo @ Clarke Quay to try the famous Singapore chilli crab. The crab dish was pretty good but one minor complain...being someone who loves spicy food, it wasn't spicy enough for me. ;) Apart from that, the other dishes we had was quite good. Service was a bit slow but it was understandable as it was pretty busy that night. All in all, it was a good dinner
3
I was looking forward to having chilli crab on my trip to Singapore.Unfortunately I found my experience at Jumbo disappointing. The waittress seemed intent on hurrying us to order and when the chilli crab arrived she did not provide any implements to crack the crab shells and seemed put out when I asked for some
4
When in Singapore one must try the chili crab. This is Singaporean national dish. They have a few location but the one on Clarke Quay over looking the river is nice. The restauant can get quite busy and service and be slow. Dine early and have more time to walk around Clarke Quay for desserts or after dinner drinks. The pepper crab is also nice but the chili crab is better. I recommend ordering the deep fried man tau (Chinese bun) to go along with the crab and to dip it into the chili sauce. A nice zinfandel or a big cabernet would go nicely. Not cheap but good
4
If you go there try Sri Lankan Chili crab or Sri Lankan black pepper crab.
4
One of the best Black Pepper Crabs I have had. Very busy for a Monday night but the wait was worth it.
4
Crab is very famous but ver messy! Good spot for families and user friendly.
3
Average food , did not live up to its name . Very poor service
4
The food is generally good, (giant) crabs are indeed one of their specialities. You'll get compeltely dirty while eating them because it is not easy to open them and the drops of sauce are fired from the crab like bullets from a machinegun. But it is definitely worth. The ambience is relaxed but a bit standard: it would perhaps benefit of a personal touch. It seems pretty popular with torists, which makes it a little crowded. The position, by the river, is quite nice. Priced like other comparables resots
3
Quite a good food but really crowded. If you want to eat along the river you really have to book well in advance and in same cases you have to leave your table as soon as you finish...not bad but there are nicer and better places..
5
The chili crab was amazing. It comes served in a giant pot and really could have been two meals. My wife had the less spicy salt and pepper crab - which also was excellent. They cautioned us on getting the regular sized crab. I asked why and they said the large was over 2KG. We had appetizers - they were yummy but after the meal I regretted getting them because our crabs were HUGE. Even with all this crab the price was affordable splurge. You must go here
5
After reading some reviews in tripadvisor we changed our original reservation from the Riverwalk outlet to the original East coast site. The ride from the centre takes approx. 15 minutes and is slightly above SIN$ 20.The location is really nice, near the sea - but crowded. So we were very pleased to have changed to this spot. We ordered very tasty shark fin soup (special at $ 22/each), some other items (very good seafood fried rice, excellent water spinach) and two crab, one chilly, one pepper.Honestly said, if I would have to choose between the both, I would go for "pepper", much nicer than the sweet chilly version.Pricewise it was very okay. For 4 persons I paid $ 210 incl. 10% tip
5
Always travelling solo in Singapore. I find myself every year having a HOT encounter at Jumbo restaurant in Clarke Quay with a 1kg pepper crab! The best experience a man could desire! Atmosphere is simply what is around you. Service is perfect. Food amazing. Price affordable. Would go there every day of my life, if I could
4
Jumbo has various outlets in Singapore, but the East Coast location is probably the only one where it's worth paying the 25% premum the chain commands just for the views. There are many better places for seafood in Singapore, but if you only have a few days, sitting along the Straits and watching the world's busiest shipping lane as the sun goes down is a sublime place to enjoy chili or pepper crab, even if it comes at a price
5
Extraordinary crab, the best we have eaten!!
The rest of the food is very good, but the Chili Crab is something to eat while in Singapore.
5
We have tried almost all the outlets of Jumbo Seafood in Singapore and must say that the qualify of food is the same wherever you go and were never got disappointed with them
4
Wxcellent fish the chilli crab was fantastic, we had a set menu and it was good value for money
5
The Jumbo Seafood at East Coast Seafood Centre is the best place in get the famous classic Singapore Chili Crab.
5
We had chili crabs, crabs with salted egg, cereal prawns, yangchow rice, and scallops. My favorite was the salted egg crab:)
5
During my trip to Singapore, I kept hearing about the famous chili crab and how I had to give it a try. I made it nearly two weeks before I finally had a chance to eat some - thanks to the invitation of my colleague who is a local. She indicated that Jumbos is THE place to go for chili crab as a local and as a tourist. Honestly, it did not take much convincing as I was looking for some really good food before I was to leave this great city/country and was hoping to have that magical moment.That magical moment did in fact come from this particular restaurant. My colleague and I were able to get a seat relatively easy just after an early evening rain storm on a Friday night which is typically busy. Little did I know the experience I was about to participate in, but eagerly anticipated my moment to taste these local delicacies. There was no need to look at the menu as I came for one thing and one thing alone - Chili Crab. However, my colleage ordered both Chili Crab and Pepper Crab. All I can say is that the meal was fantastic. Between the two, my favorite was the Pepper Crab because it was like sucking on a black pepper lollipop. The crab meat was extermely sweet and offsetting the bitter and heat coming from the black pepper that this dish was covered in. As for the Chili Crab, another masterpeice. However, I highly recommend that if you order both dishes - please start with the Chili Crab as the black pepper seasoning may overpower your taste buds a little.The atmosphere is very open and the noise level is excellent given that the restaurant is partially outdoors. Additionally, the service was fantastic as they kept bringing clean napkins regularly cleared the crab shells from the table. Plan on spending more money at this restaurant than what you normally will throughout Singapore, but the place should definitely be used as way to reward yourself after enduring a long flight to get to this great country. Although I enjoyed some of the side dishes - they just cannot hold their own against the deliciousness that is experienced from the primary crab dishes ordered. Make Jumbos your destination restaurant on your next visit to Singapore
2
There are so many inexpensive eating options in Singapore that it's just not necessary to fork out big dollars, but we liked the look of Jumbo and it is in a great location, so we gave it a shot.Got a nice table out front and nibbled on what what we thought were complimentary peanuts. We discovered they're not complimentary when the bill arrived - so why are they on the table?We didn't order Chilli Crab because we just didn't feel like it. Maybe we should have because frankly our meals were nothing special. The entrees were okay but my main course scallops were overcooked and my wife's steamed fish was bland. Add to this a lacklustre level of service and all in all, a disappointing experience
4
We ate the chilli crab at Jumbo and fortunately got a table outside along the river. The atmosphere was great and the food was delicious however the crab was messy to eat. We thoroughly enjoyed this dinner and I would recommend anyone travelling to Singapore to try it at least once
5
Certainly one of S'pore best seafood restaurants....the taste will certainly agree with most diners. Recommended dishes include its signature dishe : Chiili Crabs (order the deep fried buns to go with the gravy) and Black Pepper Crabs. Do request for the restaurant's bib , so any misadventure will be mitigated. You can also for extra to keep souvenirs (especially for tourists) .Service is brisk but can get some bottleneck during peak dining hours between 7-8pm, especially on weekends and public holidays. Other great dishes include the deep fried Tilapia fish, scallop in yam basket, bamboo clams, prawn fritters on "you tiao" (sort of flour pastry)....just follow the chef recommendation...you will be satisfied. Prices are between the mid-high range. Definitely a great venue for a tourists last meal prior departing for home as its just 15min taxi ride from Changi Airport
3
I visited this restaurant with my wife yesterday. I had chili crab and she had scallops, both of which were tasty. The service was terrible though - they got half our order wrong, forgot to bring cutlery and water to the table, had to be asked about four times to bring rice, then the manager presented us with the bill and wanted payment half way through the meal. It was only at 2.30 and the restaurant was due to close at 3.00PM. Other customers seemed to be getting similar treatment
5
Like everyone says, go for the chilli crab - and you won't be disappointed! Also tried a duck salad, cereal coated prawns (tasted better that it sounds), battered and fried scallops, prawn rolls - all very delicious.
5
Great food , great service, great location. We loved the fact that they put a bib on you! Thank goodness they did! We had a lovely walk in the moonlight along the prom next to the beach to finish our evening.Wonderful!
5
There are two Jumbo Seafood restaurants at Clarke Quay... just in case you forgot to reserve in either.
1
This place (East coast park) is the worst I have ever seen. Impossible to get proper service, the food took forever to arrive, no waiter when needed. All dishes arrived with huge delays. Nobody ate at the same time. The biggest order arrived when everybody as so fed up that the appetite clearly had gone. Each serving of peanuts was S$6, like it or not!! Even so I frequent the area often, I have never gone back
3
Have eaten here couple of times during the years. This review is based on my latest visit during October. The pros- location is nice (ok it takes some time in taxi to get there)- eating outside in simple setting near the sea- this is ideal place to bring 1st time Singapore visitors for seafood- price value is still ok- selection is good- seafood in general is pretty decent, but not really great- black pepper and chili crabs are ok (especially so for 1st time visitors)- place is pretty often packed, so make a reservation in order to get better tableThe cons- service is a bit hit and miss- to me Jumbo is now much less glamorous vs. the first time I went there- restaurant tends to cater for the masses- plenty of touristsWould I still go there? I could, but likely would look for alternative options. I would recommend strongly Jumbo for the first time visitors. Also East Coast Jumbo is nicer vs. city centre joints, which in my mind lack the feeling
4
Went here with a friend as a 'must do' in Singapore.Great location at riverside on the river. Tried to reserve online, but no call so just showed up at midday. Not too busy on a Tuesday. Staff did not seem to speak much English, and got our order wrong. Black pepper crab is one of the best seafood dishes that I have ever had! Bamboo clams also amazing. And steamed buns to dip into the sauce. Mmmm yum.Gai Lan vegetables were divine. Unfortunately, the chili crab is overrated and I did not really enjoy it (compared to the black pepper of course!!) I would not order it again.Quite expensive ($175 SGP for 2 people, no wine) but we did order alot (2 crabs and clams etc). 2 hours later we were very happy diners
3
Here's what we have:1) Chilli crabs - below average taste and crabs quality not very good.2) Yam ring scallobs - Very good3) Fresh steamed prawns - Very good4) Bamboo clams - Expensive at S$8 per piece but delicious!5) Mee Goreng - Simply yummy!Service is generally good. I've been to this restaurant for the last 21 years and although food is still generally good, the price/quality/taste has dropped a notch
4
I was lucky enough to be taken by a client while here on business. They had ordered a selection of food that culminated in the pepper crab, I could have taken a pot of the sauce home and everything was well cooked. Deserving a good reputation the service was unobtrusive, not good or bad really . If I could change 1 thing it would be to add more hand cleaning products
4
on Dec 2011, 1kg of Chilli crab is 46S$, served with 10 small buns for 3 of us. So great. But we have to wait long. Before the Chilli comes, we eat Fried Kanglung with some sauces - which I dont remember the name - a little bit spicy, oily, tasty (smell like other Chinese fried dish), served with steamed rice. Since we're hungry and still waiting for crab, that's good :DI love the buns served w the chilli crab sauces. I love the crabs served w the chilli sour sauce they give us at the beginning of the meal. I love seafood, yum yum. As I've been to Con Dao island, Nha Trang, Ha Long bay, HCMC, Da nang, Vung Tau, Haiphong (all are Vietnamese beach cities or island) and enjoyed seafood every where I can. I know for sure the crab of Jumbo is fresh, and worth the price.Total cost for 3 of us Ã­ 75.8S$, all fees including, we drink Chinese tea.I so much enjoyed it like it's just yesterday meal, hu hu. Definitely I will try the Pepper Crab as someone has recommended in previous reviews. Thanksssss for your recommendation, someone
5
It is a traditional Singapore seafood restaurant. It is on the East Coast Parkway which provides a beautiful view of the sea while you enjoy Chile Crabs, Black Pepper Crabs, Jumbo Prawns, assorted fish and cold beer. There is a multitude of dishes to select from on the menu but you must try the Black Pepper Crab. Most people go for the Chile Crab which is very good but try the the Black Pepper Crab to get a different flavor. The service is ok - it is normally very busy. The dress is very casual. You can eat inside or outside (under awnings if it is raining).
4
Love the Chilli crab
We will return on our next trip to Singapore
5
What more can I say. Go and try it, fabulous. Try the Black pepper crab as well
5
you must try the Crabs, Lobsters, Prawns & the wine.
best place to go for sea food at clarke quay!
the location of the place and the ambience is simply amazing!
A must visit restaurant in singapore!
4
Worth taking a taxi out of the city to the East Coast Parkway. This is where local Singaporeans eat excellent seafood. Speciality Chilli Crab if you have the patience have a go but wear the bib!
4
The food was great, service was prompt.
While it lacks in atmosphere, the food is great and right in the heart of the quay area.
Get the Chilli Crab and the cereal prawns. Yum
4
I am usually use to much smaller crabs. But Jumbo Seafood serve Jumbo crabs, 1kg to be exact. Went here with my partner and we had to give chilli crab and black pepper crab a go before we left singapore! So happy we came here. The crabs were massive and it got messy, but Jumbo Seafood provided us with aprons just to make the whole experience fun. It was when we went there, had to share a big table with other diners- no problems, it was our choice, we just wanted the food!I was told by a local Singaporean to order the soft buns to eat with the crab! I did and I recommend it to all! I recommend both Chilli and Black Pepper Crab, but i liked Black pepper crab slightly more! Still both delicious!
3
The chill crab is nice, abt 1kg, tasty. Other snack food is fine, no big special.Maybe coz I'm not so heavy- taste- cuisine addict, but see how hot this restaurant is, full of booking, I suppose it should be very popular in city.Pay attention that you'd better booking online, less possible to grab a table upon arrival. and dinner starts from 1730, you may also go there around 1630 booking a table (usually would be requested to finish by 1845) and walk around then come back
4
crispy squid was disappointing, but the sea bass and chili crab was amazing, with a pitcher of beer which was fairly priced for Singapore. Service was a little slow, but It was quite busy. Friendly staff. We had a reservation, and were seated 10 minutes later next to the Harbour. Will definitely retur
4
A restaurant in a waterfront setting that I recommend highly if you want to experience on of Singapore's signature dishes on such a wonderful warm evening outdoors. The restaurant had beautiful food, which included the chilli crab speciality and a mango and duck salad appertiser. The amount of waiting staff were not quite enough for the large crowd that was eating at this restaurant. If you're going to eat here, book ahead because we went on Thursday night and it was packed
5
I have been a frequent diner at Jumbo East Coast, ever since the old days at their first location in Bedok. The East Coast outlet is busy ..so book early or be prepared to wait. Its worth it. The signature dishes, i.e. pepper or chilli crab, are the best ..finger licking good..all the dishes are of the same quality standard. Service is very good considering the volume of people that come and go, and I am actually amazed at some of the totally unfair reviews posted - I can only say ..when you eat a typical outdoor Chinese seafood place ..adapt and enjoy and don't apply rigid standards. I am looking forward to take my clients back to Jumbo any time
5
Just order both and make your own mind up. The prawns in bran are the best food in Singapore
4
Go to Jumbo Seafood (riverside) in the Boat Quay at 30 Merchant Road. Ask to sit by the Singapore River. Good service and food but you'll need to ask for the bill when you are ready.
3
these guys have good food but the establishment is showing signs of getting too "fat" - by that - i mean popular. They are showing signs of Soup Nazi-esqe behavior
4
The chili crab was delicious. Seated immediately at 7pm but they requested that we be done by 8:30pm.
5
Highly recommended black pepper crab (also available is chili pepper but I preferred black pepper). This plus bok choy (forgot the local name for this) and beer. You will be more than satisfied!

We were taken by locals who treated us like visiting royalty and who knew the staff who treated them like visiting royalty so it wasn't likely we were going to be disappointed. And we weren't. I think they ordered everything on the menu for us and more. Peanuts, dried fish, Tiger beer, drunken prawns, soup, chili crab, pepper crab, steamed "ghost" fish, black pudding, yam pudding and fresh fruit. We were served by a waitress who has been there 26 years and knows how to make it happen. Perfect food, great location looking out over the "other city" on the water. Hard to imagine a better meal anywhere

Went to Jumbo Seafood located at the Seafood Center at East Coast Park.Ordered the black pepper crab, Deep fried Red Tilapia with Nonya Sauce, Tow Mieow Fried in Garlic and some fried rice.Top of the list was the Black Pepper Crab. It was a messy eating experience but is was sooooo goooood. Good thing they gave us a over sized bib. That saved my shirt more than once.The crab was not to peppery, the flesh very firm and sweet.cooked to perfection.The Deep fried Red Tilapia with Nonya Sauce was equally good. Fried till all the edges was so crispy that we even ate the tail. The flesh, whilst crispy on the outside was moist on the inside and the sauce was the perfect companion to the fried rice.The Tow Mieow was just OK. Nothing to shout about. After all, it is just another vegetable. ;-).We had our meal outside and with the cool evening sea breeze, it was just perfect

Am waiting at the east coast park center with 2 hungry kids who are screaming and yelling and these non considerate waiters keep on satin the food is coming coming...It's 1 hour since the order of a simple fried rice and boiled prawns!!Do understand that the crab takes a while but inspire of telling that the kids need the food, no one cares.No peanuts also...

Had dinner with a friend here and we were pleasantly surprised by the lemon king prawns; succulent and very tasty.Also tried our first Singapore Chilli Crab, it was very good but probably a bit of a meagre portion. The buns and white rice were good as well.In short, this is a great spot for some after-work winding down seafood dining

Last sunday we re 7 people including me went to jumbo at east coast for a dinner & we had order 1 curry crab, 1 black pepper crab &5 other dishes + steam buns. Few of our friends really like sweet & sour pork, however, since 3 of our friends are muslim so we would like to change the "pork" to "chicken" that we always do that in other restuarnts & I think it is not very weird request in a famous restaurant like "Jumbo & IN SGP". Unfortunately we recived a "NO" answer as they dont do that during weekend (too busy). So i look around & i can see it was 70% full & with plently of staffs there taking orders.We were disappointed & had no choice but to order fried chicken instead. After we had order, 3 dishes arrvd within 15mins then follow with crabs in around 20mins. So far was ok but after 30mins our buns still not arrvd so we requested twice & finallly arrvd after we had long finished our crabs. The total bill was $280 that was not too cheap but considering the service vise, I think it is worse than hawker center.Actually this is not the first I come across with some incident with jumbo, anywya i will not invite any of my friend to jumbo anymore

You could only order this if in season. I normally do not order clams but this was amazing. It was so delicious. The cereal prawns was also mouth watering. You dont have to peel the shrimps!
5
We knew the fool would be good, but were still surprised by just how incredible it was. Chili crab is a must, with buns! But my favorite was the cereal prawns. Not sure what was the herb added, but the aroma was excuisite!
5
Lovely restaurant right on the harbour. Had difficulty getting a reservation and we had to go for lunch rather than dinner as we only had limited time in Singapore. The Chilli crab is superb.....when we asked everyone recommended Jumbos..........and they were right.

Jumbo Seafood is an institution in the Singapore seafood scene. However, its popularity has however caused it to compromise on the quality and prices are now considerably high for whatever you get get on the plate. It's filled with groups of tourists visiting and service is so so. With the same amt of money, one can get a better meal elsewhere

I knew it was going to be crowded. Didn't mind too much when then gave use a time limit for the table-we had to be out by 8:3 0. Our waitress seemed unknowledgable ,rushed and preoccupied. We weren't quit sure if she WAS our waitress, we talked more to the tiger beer lady than her.Her understanding of English was limited also.I ordered lobster and she told me they were out of all the lobster but the local. Fine. I get the local lobster and it is okay. I just wanted some lobster that night,that's all Long story short ,we get up to leave and see the tanks of the live seafood, THREE kinds of lobsters along with live fish, crabs and prawns. I asked what were those things in the tanks if not lobsters? Some staff tried to tell me they were crawfish..(gee, I'm from Texas and have never even seen a 3lb crawfish...) or prawns but most did not seem to know anything about the food they were serving. Unless you are going for the chili crab or know the dialect of the waitstaff, I would stick to less busier afternoons for this place. I felt rushed,lost and disappointed at the same time. The longest time the waitress was at our table was during the signing of the bill...I would go again but only if it is not busy and only if I get to stand in front of the tanks and pick out my seafood. The price is okay for where the place is, but the service was lacking. Sorry guys, you missed the mark

went here with family & friends, paid about $150 for 4 people, a bit expensive but my baby boy loved their special fried rice! this place was packed with people, which means their food is good. we ate outside, along the river & it was enjoyable on a hot evening
5
Jumbo is regularly cited as one of the three best places in Singapore for Chili Crabs. And I agree with this recommendation. But if you were to go to Jumbo, try to have it at the Riverside branch and request for a table by the Singapore River. It makes for a nice evening. The caveat though is you have to make a reservation well in advance
5
Went with 2 other friends who were visiting Singapore and it wa a wonderful evening - the food is to die for. You may think that with such a huge crowd that the service and food would be questionable but both were very good. The food arrived at the right time and the portions were good. The sallops in XO sauce werfe unbelievable as was gthe other dishes. Sitting in the open with the slight breeze blowing ona balmy Singapore night with the sound fo the ocran was sooo nice. The overall price for the three of us was very good indeed and we definitely got value for money.Would rfecommend to anyone who would like a really good seafodo meal and a great evenin

We have over the years visited quite a few East coast seafood restaurants and have had enjoable meals. Not so with Jumbos.We were a group of 4 and order a main each however they were served one after the other and dispite requests they would not serve them together. Consequently the whole meal was drawn out and every one ended up drinking more than they intended. My wife was served first so she had finished her meal before anyone else was served. I had order Chilli Crab and was last to be served, which was rather boring for the others.Two of the meals were good, two were left half finished as they were anything but appetising.The meals and drinks were not cheap but would have been acceptable if the meal experience had been up to expectations.Service obviously was poor and we were dealt with in a very rude manner.Do yourself a favour if you want a seafood meal eat elsewhere
1
I have been to jumbo restaurant a lot of times and I even became a member of this chain with a recognition card which gives me a 10% discount every time I eat there...... yes but the point is that the last time I went they told me that they cannot serve the food between certain hours if you are alone.......Is this a Singapore policy?I was very disappointed
3
It is always a great experience to enjoy a pepper crab on East Coast, and the quality of the food is reputable and consistent. BUT.... Be prepared to one of the lousiest service in town. Food comes whenever ready, regardless of what your companions have ordered. A crab may come fast, the other one will be served 30 minutes later... or never. I had to ask them 3 times when my order will be served, and eventually canceled it after waiting one hour. Unfortunately, this is not the first time such things happen..

Spent a week long business trip in Singapore and my local colleagues kept bringing up the "must have" Singapore "chili crab" dining experience to me. So on my last night I decided to go for it. They recommended Jumbo's Restaurant by the river. I called and they were able to fit me in at 6pm. I found it a bit odd that the hostess specifically mentioned that I could only stay at the restaurant until 7:15pm. Didn't seem very customer friendly. While the ambience was not impressive -- I was put at an outside table near stacked tables and chairs -- the food was excellent. I started w/ the pumpkin seafood soup, deep fried bean curd w/ chopped vegetables, then the chili crab entree (fresh, sweet fresh crab cooked in spicy chili sauce) and topped off my meal w/ the mango pudding. It was a delicious meal, and even the less than average service and ambience didn't affect the joy my tastebuds experienced. I would highly recommend the dining experience for the food (not the service) at Jumbo's. I rated this restaurant a "4" for the food only
2
We went there specifically for the chilli crab for my fiance, which was great, but the wait was far too long. As I do not like crab I ordered satay sticks and Supreme Seafood Fried Rice as the picture in the menu looked impressive. When the rice arrived I was taken aback by the difference between the photo in the menu and what was in front of me. I enquired with our waitress as to the difference and was told that the menu was an example only. I told her that the difference was just too great and to take the rice away and to have it taken off our bill. Also the satay sticks were very ordinary and I truly could have done better myself, When we arrived at the restaurant and were seated, a bowl of peanuts was placed in front of us, I was quite horrified when we received the bill that we had been charged for these, and believe me it was a miniature bowl of peanuts!
5
Went to the Jumbo east coast, SIngapore during my last trip in June 2011 with colleagues. We had the yummiest Chilly carb with sweet small buns and awesome pepper carbs! It was just right for my tastebuds and I really over ate and still felt I didnt have enough!
5
Went for the famous chilli crab ! My wife and I got there on a Saturday Afternoon, we asked for a table for two, lady asked if we had a reservation, We didnt ! didnt even know we had to make a reservation. She was great, she accomodated us, but said, we must be dont at a certain time, that gave us like 2 hrs, we were cool with that. We could see the place was busy too.Great service, the waiters all had earpieces on, (which was pretty cool )they communicated that way, Everything was quick and the food was great !Well worth a visit

We had two bad expericences at Jumbos at East Coast recently. The first time we arrived in two groups and despite having the same reservation number we were seated at two different tables (which we found out after waiting for the oher group respectively after half an hour). The second time we also had a reservation but were told to qeue to get our tabel. After half an hour of waiting we were told that we were too late and our reservation had expired (!). Needless to say, we did not wait any more for a free table but went straight for the competition opposite. As a general word of advise, avoid East Coast seafood center on weekends unless you come very early or late. At prime time, the place is a real mess. If you are so lucky to get a place, the crab is still very decent
3
Went for a birthday dinner with my family and we were disappointed with the quality of almost all the dishes. We ordered 2 chilli crabs and were unimpressed. Even their fried rice were so lumpy and wet that we had to ask them to re-cooked it. Most of our dishes were served lukewarm and not hot. Maybe the food were not served immediately due to the busy crowd.
3
I just went there last Wed. 30 March with my husband and his visiting friends @ Clarke Quay branch.The service in this branch and the one in East Coast all poor.But the East Coast branch had a better taste & quality for food and the menu was more choice for none seafoods dishes.We ordered 1 Chili Crab,1 Black Pepper Crab,1 steam fish with ginger and lemongrass, 2 lamb chops and crispy chicken...all of them were o.k nothing special about it (Clarke Quay branch).In the mean time, same order at EC branch was quite good and 7 of my group were happy after all done.In my opinion,the one in EC is worth to go even it's far from where I live (close to orchard rd.,) The price is a little high but I can't use the words overprice (if u normally eat at restaurants in Singapore..all of them are the same rank except the restaurant at 5 * hotel here..extremely high) Recommended ; if you wanna try this brand you should go to the one in E
3
After you have sorted through the chaos and been seated, you are then informed that you have a little over an hour to eat before you must vacate due to overbooking.The food is actually rather average. The egg prawns tasted floury and gluggy, the full roast chicken was actually deep fried, and the prices fro crap and lobster are grossly inflated..Australian lobster $S194 / KG = $S90 /Lb or local lobster $S138 / KG = $S65 / Lb .......on top of the above price, you must then add 10% GST and 7% service charge, making the lobster over $S225 / KG !!!!!! All in all, the riverside Jumbo was a fairly forgettable experience
2
We had been to the East Coast version of this chain a few years ago and had rather liked its frenetic atmosphere with tasty food. We were thus very disappointed when we went to the Jumbo Seafood on the Singapore River. The food was dull, the scallops almost tasteless and the 'award winning' egg battered prawns were uninviting and soggy. More egg than seafood. Perhaps the restaurant reviews should discriminate among the many versions of this chain
4
If you seek for good chilli crab, here is the right place. A bit pricy as it is well known by both tourists & residents. Wide range of menu, but iit's often congested. Must book in advance.
3
If you are looking for eating crabs and seafood, you can try to go there but do not expect a warm welcome and attentive service. You shall certainly be treated like the 500th clients ot the day.

First of all. this Jumbo restaurant in Riverwalk by opposite of Clark quay is Crappy.We had to chance for stop over Singapore for about 6 hours total between flight.Me and my wife decide to have quick experince of singpore by have famouse Cilli crap in their Famouse Jumbo restaurant. We took MRT to Clark quay station and arrived bit late at 1:40pm(Lunch service is close at 2:30pm) Reception lady asked us if we have any reservation and we said 'No' to her and she gave us outside seating for 2 people just next to their cleaning station and river view was blocked by Cuttlery station, we asked inside building table which has air-conditioned.But she said its only for people who has reservation, even though only one table is occupied and other's all empty.Then we asked her to change our table to balcony seat, which has nice riverside view, then she said its only for big group of people (but 5 big table was empty) and refused. after my action of leaving the restaurant, she agree to give table at balcony)Chilli crap was OK. (bit too sweet ) fried rice we ordered was very salty,And restaurant waiter don't understand English.took me three attempt to get ice cold water.And finally HIDDEN service charge and VAT on top of menu price.I felt daytime robbery by this Crappy restaurant.They even closed their order by 2:10pm, so can't even order cold drink and gave us bill at 2:15pm, while i am still having lunch and demand payment.DO NOT GO THIS RESTAURAN

We made an advance reservation for the Jumbo Seafood Restaurant at the Riverwalk Boat Quay, Singapore.Upon a Arrival we were shown to our table located next to a scrap food trolly albeit near the River sidewalk. A waiter took our order of a couple of Entree's of Vietnamese Fish Sugar-Cane sticks and Duck & Mango Salad. The main ordered was the Famous Chilli Singapore Crab with Rice. Within 5 minutes of the order the Chilli Crab appeared, we thought that this was a little strange as the Entree's usually appear first. we waited for a while for the other dishes to arrive. Eventually we called over the waiter who suddenly couldn't understand English asking where our other dishes were. He shrugged his shoulders and disappeared.We embarked on the Crab without even the Rice. The plates were small as were the tables, It was impossible to keep the flying Chilli Sauce from hitting your neighbouring Diners Ten minutes later the Duck Dish and Rice appeared, then after more badgering of the waiter the Vietnamese Dish appeared.I feel were given the Crab due to a wrong order in the Kitchen and they saw a quick opportunity to unload it onto to us. We complained to the manager regarding the order of service and lack of understanding, his pre-programmed response was in this order, we are very sorry, would you like a free desert and here is the bill. I would class this restaurant as a very expensive Fast Seafood Restaurant (think McDonalds on Chilli Crab) and shouldn't be used for occasions.I fear that with the big influx of tourists into this area nothing will ever change...don't dine here

It's chaotic, crowded, and filled with locals and tourists alike. The food is served family style and is often messy, but its oh so good. If you like to experience a new place through its food then Jumbo is a Singapore establishment you must try. There are six in the area but my favorite is the East Coast Seafood Centre location. Its a 15-20 minutes cab ride from downtown
4
Very central restaurant. Massive but fully booked. We had to wait for a while to get a table. There are six Jumbo Restaurant in Singapore, but the one in Clarke Quay is definitely very busy. We had to sit inside rather than outside, so if you want to stay on the river make sure you book. Heaps of locals there. We ordered one chilli crab which was enough for two people

I lived in East Coast Singapore and visited restaurants around these area very often. For seafood, I normally go with Jumbo or No Sign Board because of the quality of the food and service. Nowadays, Jumbo seafood seems changed both of their chief and the management team as their food quality goes down dramatically and no more service standard at all. It took nearly an hour for a black paper crab to be ready and the crab weighted around 400g not the normal size back to old good time around 700g. They have more waitress than before but none of them pay attention to the customer but chit chat in 2 or 3 pax a group. I expressed my disappointment to one of the waitress and the answer from her was "thank you" in a very arrogant attitude. I will not recommand this restaurant to any of my friends or visitors to Singapore and I feel shame for them
4
We didn't make reservations and we did regret it as it was busy on a thursday evening. We got a table outside with a fan moving on top of us. It did moved the air so it was cooler at the same time however ther was a light behind which caused together with the fan a stroboscopic effect. This caused an unresty situation.Â Their food did offset this though as we had some of the best boiled shrimps, fried rice and fried fish we ever tried. The service was quick and profesional.A day later we decided to do take-away. We were again surprised how good the food was. All in all we strongly recommend it
5
Everytime I stay in Singapore I go to Jumbo Seafood on the East Coast Park. It's a great location just near the sea and the food is just outstanding. Staff is always friendly and attentive. I would (and do) recommend it to everybody who visits Singapore
5
This place at Clarke Quay is one of the many places where I had the best chilli crab . Those who have visiting Singapore should definitely try the crab here followed by pub hopping in any of the pubs nearby ! Try the buns too 
4
Outdoor / open air restaurant ideal for sampling the messy Singapore delicacy of Chili crab. Great atmosphere...not pretty but authentic. Try the pepper crab for contrast.
4
The most beloved sea food restaurant in Singapore.
Chili Crab and Black Peper Crab are both "must" at this restaurant and in Singapore
3
Its a must. Delicious gravy. The restaurant resembled a tourist trap, howevever "service"
very fast and efficient, client in - client out -next customer.... Dont miss it, its an experience.. And dont forget the buns!!
5
I always eat in this nice restaurant when I pass trough Singapore.
I personally think that their Black pepper crab is amazing!!!!!!!!!
In general the restaurant is very noisy but the quality of the seafood will make you forget it.
Will be there soon!

Mid Autumn Fesitval at Clarke Quay brought locals and tourists alike, out in droves to join in the celebrations and festivities - and of course, satisfying the craving for food was high on everyones' agenda! Despite solid bookings, Jumbos staff went out of their way to find us a table, ensuring we wouldn't leave Singapore without trying their world famous chillie crab.Jumbos staff provided first rate service & attention from the moment we were seated & decked out in our oversized bibs (an absolute necessity when tackling this course), serving our meals and replenishing beverages. The appetisers and main courses were plentiful, well presented and a taste sensation! It's a messy chore tackling chillie crab and there's really no nice way of going about it - just tuck in and enjoy! Those little finger bowls were put on the table for a reason!All in all, an experience not to be missed - your choice of indoor or dining outside on the quay, will make this a highlight of your dining explorations in Singapore

I thought about going to East Coast Seafood Centre to visit the original Jumbo seafood location, but it was a bit of a trip just for dinner, so I settled to dine at the Riverwalk location, right next to Singapore River and near Clarke Quay. I heard so much about their chili crab, so I ordered a kilo of it, two steamed buns (which were tiny!) and stir fried crawfish (or crayfish). Though I heard that chili crab can be quite pricey depending on where you go, I had mine for 42 SGD and found it quite filling for a grown man. The chili crab was quite good, the meat juicy and the chili addictive, that I was going hog wild with that crab for good 15-20 minutes. Chili crab is quite difficult to eat with its hard shells, so even with the utensils they provide, prepare to get messy. Thank god they gave me a bib. The steam buns as I mentioned were tiny, plain and for 1SGD felt a bit pricey. Though the crayfish were supposed to be live ones prepared and cooked, my waitress informed that they did not have fresh ones which I understood. Sold by 100grams, I found the 400 grams just right in quality after the chili crab.The location is great, just right in the city center, and the wait staff served me well. Unless I find a better chili crab place in Singapore, this is the place I will go to again

East Coast Jumbo Seafood 06/Aug/ 2010As part of the Singapore experiance we were told the that The East Coast Seafood park was a must see for the freshest seafood in Singapore.WWe were told to get there early as there can be a lack of taxi's later on in the night. At 6.30 pm we left our hotel The Grand Copthorne Waterfront and caught a Taxi to the Seafood Park.Cost $19.60 as we were travelling during peak hour we had to pay the traffic tolls. About 1/2 hour drive. Most seafood is charged at Market prices . Prawns $60.00 per kilo, Crab $95.00 per kilo average size crabstarts at 900 grams min. So check before you buy!! On arriving at the park we were greeted by the delicious mouth watering aroma of cooking seafood. After a short stroll around viewing the various restraurant's menu's of the restraunts we chose to eat at the Jumbo Seafood.We were greeted in the usual friendly Singapore fashion and chose four dishes to try for our meal. They offered a 10 % discount for touristsOur first course was Crayfish with ginger & spring onions. We were served tea & a bowl of peanuts while we waited for our first course to arrive.The cray fish that arrived Cacker sized (if you were in Australia) consisted of 2(two) morton bay bugs. They were timley served the sauce was fragrant and not over powering the cray fish was over cooked and dry.7/10 Second course was Fish in Banana leaves the taste was rather plain and loaded with chilli. 1/10Third course was Scallops wrapped in yam paste these were lightly fried nice & light and nicely cooked. 8/10Fourth course was a Beggars hot pot a collection of seafood not to be recomend unless all you want to taste chilli.At Bill time we were charged an extra 10% service charge + charged for the peanuts plus for the tea that was on our table. not complimentary like we presumed.The staff were pushy on the larg ticket items and we were frowned upon when we did not order the crabA short stroll brought us to the Tawandang Micro brewery for a quick beer for the long treck back to our hotel (only 3 Beers brewed so far) a larger, a dark beer & a Meizen (an aromatic beer) at onlt $8.00 for 300 Ml.While there we were still a bit peckish so we ordered a shrimp with mix veg $18.00 prawns with little noodle balls, salad & a beautifull peanut dipping sauce with just a hint of chilli. 8.5/10Also we had Deep fried chicken $18.00 pieces of chicken simply deep fried & served with a cajun type dipping sauce. 9.5/10Once again 10 % service charge. we would highly recomend this place. The atmosphere was relaxed. If any one wants the menu for the brewery I can send them a cop

We were recommended by locals to Dempsey Road for fantastic food and because we wanted crab we choose Jumbos. The food was delicious and well priced. The service however was disorganised - but we could put up with that for the outstanding food. We had salt and pepper crab - $42 a kilo, an appetiser - jellied cuttlefish (I think!) my son had 2 chicken dishes as the first was so good, 2 cocktails, 2 beers and 2 cokes and it only came to $120 Singapore dollars - great value in our books. We ate outdoors which was lovely. One thing to be aware of when you eat at a restaurant in Singapore is the dishes they give you as you sit down are not free, neither are tea or towels and they automatically add a 10% service charge. I will put up with that though for the great foo

Be very careful with this restaurant if you are a tourist. If you order a 1kg Crab make sure they give you a 1kg crab. I got cheated the other night. The crab that I got was no more than 600gm. I realized it after a few bites. When questioned, they apologized and claimed they ran out of the big crab and started blaming the inexperience of the waiter for not letting me know. Then they claim the price for the smaller crab is the same as the larger one. I will never go to this restaurant again
5
I lived in Singapore for 10 years and this is the #1 place I would recommend to eat. There are a few other locations now, however the original in the East Coast Seafood Centre is the best for atmosphere. You must order a chili and pepper crab as well as seafood fried rice and fried buns to go with the chili crab. You should also try the Honeydew Sago as a desert. Its the perfect finish to the meal
4
Our family's favourite seafood place whenever we go to ECP! Great place to eat because! They allows our pet to dine together with us! Which is really good for customers with pets. Great Crab! Great Veges. Just that their dishes could be rather pricey.

On the river Chilli crab and Fried rice was great. Will do it again.

Chilli crabs are decent, I like Long beach better for those

We were invited to Jumbo by local friends to savour the seafood and the sunset. We were not disappointed. The food was super especially the scallops in yam baskets. The resstaurant was busy but the service was excellent. Be aware that the portion sizes are offered as S,M and L = they are pretty generous. so best to order a few dishes then review before ordering more food. Great night
5
This restaurant was fantastic - outdoor seating near the river on a hot humid Singapore night, prompt service (though not particuarly friendly) but the main thing they serve here is the chilli crab.Not the most elegant food to eat as they serve you with a bib and trust me - unless you eat crab regularly like some of the locals, you'll get it absolutely everywhere.They import the crab from Sri Lanka but it's the most tasty crab I've ever had. Can't wait to go back on our return trip home.The egg coated prawns are also a must try - weird but really fantastic

There are several Jumbo restaurants in Singapore which may explain the mixed reviews. The restaurants may or may not belong to the same franchise. This review is about the large Jumbo Seafood in Clarke Quay.In summary, this restaurant has a good location with average food and terrible service and value. Its menue is misleading and the food offering has a cunning marketing spin to lure people into ordering food that sounds great, but offers little value. Don't give in to the waiters who offer you seating inside the restaurant only after 9 pm. They serve food outside until 11.15 pm.My partner and I went to the restaurant on a 2 day stopover from Kota Kinabalu to Bali.Atmosphere:Good location along the riverbank with nice large terrace - without the location, the review would have been worse.Food and value:Having experienced outstanding quality food among others at street stalls in KK, the quality of the Jumbo food appears average and an experience you better don't enjoy. The lobster dragonfruit salat with caviar had negligible caviar/lobster and comprised half a dragonfruit for a total of SGD 14. Just accross the border in JB, I paid the equivalent of SGD 5 for 5 large dragonfruits. The wine is expensive even if you stick to the cheapies (but goodies) from Australia or New Zealand (SGD 56). The seafood platter cost SGD 36 (18 per person) and contained 2 small shrimps, 2 larger shrimps 2 oysters, 2 pieces of octopus, 2 pieces of marinated fish and one smaller crab (no sushi as indicated on the menu). Include two glasses of sparkling water and the bill adds up to SGD 136.20 (without main course - see below) .Service:We arrived at 9.20 pm and the waiter indicated that they could only seat us inside. When pointing at free tables outside and threatening to leave, we were awarded a table outside. As we got seated, the couple next in line was given the same initial treatment although several tables were available next to us (the waiter later confirmed that dinner was served outside until 11.15 pm). 25 minutes after we ordered and drank half of our bottle of wine, the waiter came back and indicated that our main menue was not available and if we wanted to order something else instead.Given the quality of the starters I was ready to leave without a main course, which would have increased the bill to an unacceptable level for the quality offering.There are many other nice restaurants at Clarke Quay, Good luck for those people who still want to try this one

I stumbled on this place an evening after a long day of walking during a stopover at Singapore. The chilli crab was delicious and the price was reasonable. This was by far my best experience in Singapore, and it's so close to the airport! the taxi ride back to the airport was just a few minutes. This is a must if you like seafood and you have a few hours to spare in Singapore between flights
