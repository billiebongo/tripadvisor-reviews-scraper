Pleasant food, cheaper beer (after 5pm) and quick service on the whole. Not a wide choice of food for a vegetarian.
5
Food is amazing and delicious. Portion is sufficient. Ambience was great and not so crowded. Staff is friendly too.

Just stopped in to have quick drink on very hot day. I should have saved my money. Drink was delicious. Bartender was jerk.
3
Just like most places in Singapore very average bar servicing average drinks and food. Nothing really to shout about.

Called in with some friends for drinks and a bite to eat, the waiter was very helpful and accommodating when we wanted our drinks served a certain way, we also had pizzas each, to be honest one can serve 2. Pouring raining did not damper the evening, quite surreal really, sitting under cover with the rain pouring down and it was 25c

We decided to stop by before heading to the shore to watch the fireworks. Place was full, but friendly staff managed to find us seats when we agreed to spend at least 100$ during our stay. Drinks were good and service was fine considering the busy night of new years eve... But the food. Damn it was tough. Ordered the jazz burger with "angus beef" but if it really was something else than cheapest stuff they could find it must have been purchased like two years ago and kept frozen until now. Probably the first time ever that I did not finish a burger. Wife ordered salmon salad and that was ok, but there was very little fish. Can't really recommend this place for eating unless you find yourself starving to death and this is your only hope. People around us seemed also to be not so hungry as there was lot on their plates when they finished eating...

We stopped here for a drink as we were walking back to our hotel. We ordered and consumed our drinks - all good so far. We then asked for our bill which came to approx $25. I gave the waitress 3x$10 notes and waited for our change. One of the waiters then came over and stated that the bill was $25 and we had given $20. We insisted that we had given $30. He went away and then another guy came over, who we assumed was the manager. He again pointed out the amount of the bill and that there was only $20 there. We insisted again that we had given the waitress 3 $10 notes. He went away and questioned the waitress who looked puzzled and began searching the area around the till and the floor area. Lo and behold, there was a $10 note on the floor. Our change was then brought to us, however no apology was forthcoming.We understand that mistakes happen, but after we were made to feel like cheats, it would have been common courtesy for one of them (preferably the manager) to have apologised to us

We arrived at 6.00pm and ordered the triple sausage platter and considering we were the first customers and the food had not arrived at 6.30pm we asked the waiter who gave us a pretty lame answer that there was a technical fault with the printer. It actually turned out that the order was not given to the kitchen! When the good finally arrived, it felt like the sausages were not grilled properly and it was not like hot out of the grill. They must have rushed it on discovering that we will be late for our concert. Disappointing service

Harry's is located just inside the Esplanade Mall and a very good drop-off point for our walk around the River Front area, across from the MERLION Park, also the Sands Hotel. There are FREE Concerts on the riverfront every evening. Great nightlife area!The food was very good. I did the Beef Cheeks, sort of like a beef roast. Very Tender and OH so good. Of course I added a Pint of Connors a wonderful dark beer
2
Dinner at Harry's at Esplanade last night.Ordered the spare ribs, after 30 min suddenly the waiter put the plate in front of me and disappeared.No fork or knife.Called another waiter and asked for them.French fries were cold and the meat had a strange taste.I thought it was the marinade, but taste was really not good so I only had half.Once I got home I got really sick, so I guess the meat must have been bad.Last time Harry's for me
5
We ate here for lunch on 2 days and late afternoon drinks on the third day. The food is good as is the beer, however like everything in Singapore it is expensive; about Â£10 for 2 half pints
2
This place is only good for drinks. Selection of drinks and ambience makes this a good drinking hole.
Food is horrible. Bar type of food.
5
After a long day of exploring, it was a great spot for a late lunch, cold wine and a nice view. Food was fresh and delicious and the carb free fish burger - delicious !
3
There apparently quite a few Harry's in Singapore. Average food, atmosphere & service. Kind of like a US food chain (i.e. Chili's). Really greasy fish & chips.
3
8 of us came to dine at this place. No staff approached us, so sorted out the tables and chairs ourselves. We also had to get our own menus and then also make our order at the bar. The service after this got slightly better but was still poor. The drinks were fine. The food at best Average. Nothing stood out as anything special and the prices are not cheap. There are much better places in the area. I think Harry's might be sitting back on it's laurels from other branches.I wont be going back. The next night we went to Barrossa a few doors down, I suggest you do the same
3
We were seated in a prepared table but it was smelly and sticky. Not a good start. I only saw two servers and one bartender on a friday night. They serve different beers and good cocktails. Dessert is heavenly. I love the sticky pudding and adult cheesecake. Yum!We asked for a glass of water but it took 20mins to be served. Really
4
A great place to chill out and unwind. Nice music with great people and all sort of drinks to choose from, cocktails to mocktails to juice and soft drinks and not forgetting wings!!There's food promotion so please do check with staff over there. Credit card discount is applicable for standard chartered cardholders!Happy drinking

Food was good taste and big portion, service was oke, staff are friendly and willing to help. Beverage was serve late after food. Wifi connection good, price wise very competitive, staff are not active and agressive in selling, menu variation was cool enough, good ambience and recomended place to hang out with friends and familly

My friend and i went on the 18th Sep 2016, we ordered 2 beef cheeks and it was served to us without cutleries! We even had to follow up 3 times. I would understand if they are packed but i think only 4-5 tables were occupied. 3 waitresses were standing in front of us but they were avoiding us and the customers on the other table calling them.They were more focused on the Television than their customers! To make it worse, the food was bland! MUST Avoid this place

Guys. Quick services is always good and there are plenty of staff so the drinks were fast. We ordered nachos to go with the drinks. They are $18 so we were expecting to be able to share given they don't have an meat. They arrived and we're stuck to the board and very small to share! We told our waitress and her comment was " thanks for your feedback". That was the end of it. Interesting customer services.
4
Good location for a quick and casual bar style food. I enjoyed the Happy hour service whilst there. Definitely will return.
3
Food was decent pub food, all the usual suspects present! We enjoyed the location, and service was good. It's a fair choice - nice drinks selection and a good, well priced meal.
5
One of several places to eat situated on Esplanade. Always very popular in evening and outdoor seating area available if preferred. (Weather permitting) Good choice of food and drink, with something on the menu possibly to suit everyone's taste
4
Arrived in Singapore around midday and was staying close to The Esplanade. Spotted Harry's and they were offering a set lunch menu. Plenty of choice,and for Singapore,reasonably priced. Service was good and so was the Fish and Chips along with a soft drink
5
If you want to get a little bit away from the local curry food and taste, Harry's the place. Good burgers and appetizers. Good music and atmosphere.
5
Great place to hang out before waiting for your musical play to start. Had dinner here while waiting for Les Miserable to start and I got to say the food here was good. Despite the outlet being super packed and busy. The Chef and service staff made it seem effortless
4
We visited Harry's restaurant at the Esplanade for a late dinner and we're pleased with the experience. Enjoy the pasta dish and a hamburger and both were very good quality. Prices seemed reasonable and service was good. The best part about the place was the end door air conditioning on a hot humid night
3
Dropped in prior to a weekend concert at the Esplanade. We were six of us & in spite of prior reservations, there was no table available to accommodate us nicely. Anyway in a hurry we ordered some Pasta, Sweet Potato fries, Veg burgers and drinks. The service was quick though the table was cramped and we could manage the time line. On the whole,all I can say is maybe one can drop in for a 'quick bite' here but certainly not a relaxed full dinner. High stools at the bar seemed inviting for a quick business drink
4
I went to 2 branches of Harry's which were in Velocity@Novena and Cuppage Road food were just so so. Today 4 of us stopped by at 6.30 p.m. before show at Esplanade Theater. We ordered - Chicken wings which quite good. - Beef and Chicken Satay was ok- Bread and prosciutto was ok- Chicken Tikka Pizza was OK. 3 glass of red wine & 6 pint of beers. The service was quite attentive before 7 p.m. After that quite challenge to get more drinks. The price came up for 298$.No happy hour before 9 p.m. Coz they knew most busy time is before show. After show this place would probably empty.

I always like Harry's and they use to have great service despite the menu is not cheap. After a long patient period? Island wide doesn't really serve the cider that they placed on the menu and the service are bad here....pfff...they way the servers treat you like your a begger...as a patron? you have to "wailing none-stop to get their attention for a simple order" just like wailing over another ship that thousand yards away...disapointed with this outlet entirel
4
The vegetarian starter called black charcoal with eggplant dip was just great and a very new thing which I tasted.pizza was ok and the fries were very nice..thumbs up to service and location.
4
We ate here before going to the Dans Festival. Friendly servers recommended good selections. Service was prompt. Food at Harry's is always good.
4
Good for a few beers and dinner after work and very handy for all transport. Convenient location next to great shopping centre
4
Found it a fine casual place in a beautiful area near the marina. The food was nice. Ordered Beer Buttered Prawns and Seafood Noodles. None disappointed.
5
Wife was working so only right and proper to meet her from work at a local establishment and partake in liquid refreshment
I can recommend the HPL
5
Had dinner here and a first time for me. Service and food was great. The waitress that serve my table was beautiful and helpful. Didn't get a chance to ask her name as it was starting to get busy. But she's the only chinese girl i saw and would like to give a huge thumbs up!

Had excellent meal with relatives. We were told it was busy in the evening, but it appeared quite empty. Good portions and tasty food. Good service. Pleasant to sit by the river in the evening and watch the world go by. Be aware if you have open toed shoes. There are mice/rats that scoot round floor I was bitten on the toe by one. We only saw 1 but be carefulLocals sit with their feet up.

This started off so well and then ended up with us being shunned and left with no option but to walk out. We visited this place after the f1 race. My wife is a Manchester United supporter so we asked the staff if they were showing the United match, we were told 'yes' so we sat down and ordered food and drinks..20 minutes later the manager ignored a bar full of people watching the football and switched it to the rugby!!Shocking behaviour... Terrible customer service and staff that lie.
4
We visited Harry's a number of times during the Singapore Grand Prix weekend and were served some brilliant cocktails and very nice food. The service there is great - the waiters recognised us on our second visit and even remembered our drinks order even though thousands of people must have gone through there over the GP weekend
5
Went on a really busy day the staff was friendly and managed to get us a table immediately. We ordered a burger which was the best burger we had in Singapore and at a reasonable price. The atmosphere is fun probably ideal for a night out with friends.
3
Called in for a drink and snack nice outlook but overpriced ,had dinner for 4 with drinks in china town for $20 less than 4 drinks at Harry's
4
Perfect evening watching the river cruisers, people watching, nice food & great Singapore Slings.
Burgers were very good
Large TV with sports on proved popular.
Good choice of cocktails & western food
5
The service is amazing and the Chicken Tandoori was great. Ram was an amazing waiter. 2 very good HD TVs. Also loved chijmes!
5
After dinner at the Jumbo, Dropped in Harry's Bar for a glass of wine. Great view and ambiance. Was able to observe the water skying!! A great spot late night drink, not to be missed

Harry's Bar offers a good selection of food at sensible prices. Three of us shared two orders of fish and chips, which was more than enough as there are three pieces of fish for each order! The fish was excellent - if a little "over-battered" - but the chips were disappointing. They were not very hot and lacking in taste. I think they had probably been double-fried - what's wrong with a good old-fashioned chip straight from the deep-fryer?The winner for us was a selection of sensibly priced wines (for Singapore) - significantly cheaper than other restaurants in the area. Recommended if you are not looking for fine dining or a romantic atmosphere. The ambience is very much utilitarian/casual

You'll see from my reviews that I very rarely post anything less than a three star review. That's not to say that on occasion we don't have the best time in an establishment but I think that everyone can have an 'off day'. However with Harry's at the Esplanade I think something needs to be pointed out to them. They describe themselves as "the best bar and dining establishment" this was far from our experience! We were seated over an hour before we were due to attend a performance in the next door theatre and ordered drinks and a variety of food. We didn't expect to need to tell them we had theatre tickets as food comes quickly in any restaurant in Singapore and I think especially an American style bar to be one of the quickest. Indeed the chicken Caesar one of our guests ordered came relatively quickly but then nothing came out for around 15 minutes. A member of staff then came to our table, unprompted by us to say that the kitchen were struggling with the new menu, apologising for the delay and saying that they would be as quick as possible. At this point we said we needed to be at the theatre in 30 mins and the server said she would 'do her best' to get our order. Another ten minutes passed and we asked how long it was likely to be and was told it shouldn't be long or we could cancel the order. We waited another 10 minutes by which time it was clear that we were not going to be able to eat and get to the theatre so we told them to cancel. There appeared to be little embarrassment or further apology from the staff so we finished our drinks and asked for the bill. At this point I expected the drinks to be comped to compel us to try them again on another occasion. We are only talking about one beer, one mineral water and one soda, but rather than damage limitation the staff chose to charge us and, to add insult to injury, they included their service charge! If this happened in many parts of the world the restaurant would soon be out of business. Should Singaporeans expect anything less?

Been here for the second time in all these years as I was entertaining a friend. The place is way overpriced for simple drinks and foods and taking the Harry's brand name a bit too far for over pricing. Would not visit the place again - simply because it is not worth the money. Ambience is decent though
3
Good bartender. Margaritas weak on tequila. Delicious house white wine. Okay nachos (chips with drizzle of sour cream and avocado cream and a very light sprinkling of tomato and black olives. Cheese and salsa and chili con carne served as accompanying sides). It's a good stopping place to escape the heat but not that remarkable--other than for the funny Harry quotes on the walls and wait staff shirts
3
We ended up at Harry's after the light show. That was about the only place open at around 10:15 pm in the vicinity, or at least these travellers could find a place.The meal was not bad- found out the food is cooked centrally and brought in to be heated and served.I wasn't able to get a draft stout, so ended up drinking a lager.For a quick bite, this would not be bad, but if you are wanting "real cooked food" try some other place.Service was fair, perhaps because it was late in the evening

Walked around Marina Bay on a typical hot day. Easiest route was not available due to preparations for National Day. Finally reached access to waterfront bars and chose Harry's. Delighted Asahi was on tap and it was warm! Ordered crab cakes and they were the size of a ten cent piece.So cost us about $40SD for two warm beers and tiny crab cakes.Mind you we walked up to the Merlion and priced beers at the restaurant there; $14 SD for a Tiger! Didn't have one
