Food is great, but not something that will make me return again and again. Service is rather slow, though the servers are kind and nice, it could have been more efficient/ faster.
5
Good venue for small gathering, excellent food and recommendation by the staff. Wine was great as well.
4
My family has visited this restaurant a few times, always like the ambience and food. Service is great too
4
Brought my family to Rubato last weekend and had a satisfying meal. The beef rib was fantastic. Squid ink risotto an octopus was delicious too.
4
Staff may seems hard selling but they respect our choices.
Their staff looks like "rough man", thus may be intimating to some.
But can tell they have gone through service training and ever ready to please .
Food are good but on the expensive side.
5
The staffs and valet are all very nice and cheerful and friendly. Love the food very much, and the environment was wonderful too! This is my favourite restaurant!
4
Clean spacious bright restaurant with attentive friendly staff. Excellent all cheese pizza and good seafood, squid ink pasta. Prices appropriate to food quality which means not cheap but not ridiculously expensive. Parking is a premium for all the eateries in the area as lots are free but spaces are limited. You sometimes have to park several streets away at beak times. Access a bit tricky for those with mobility aids as it’s two steps up from the carpark and spacing is a bit narrow between tables

We used be fans of Rubato but had not been back for a while... and after last night’s experience, we will not be back. In short:1) pushy in-your-face waiter who kept pushing the specials; inattentive service otherwise 2) for our group of 8, we ordered 3 specials - an OP rib (portion was for the 4 guys as the women did not care for that) and 2 platters of antipasto - one seafood and one with cold cuts (again each was a 4-person portion). Plus other food from the menu like fish and pastas. We were charged $219 for the rib and $168 each for the platters! Perhaps we should have asked about the pricing of the specials, but frankly we would not have balked if it was not so ridiculously over priced. It’s really bad taste when an established restaurant rips customers off like that. Very disappointed, disgusted and will definitely not be going back.
4
We had a very good experience on the food selection. Everyone was diligent and friendly. the moment we entered until completion. Look for Sam. He has very good recommendations and is very realistic and honest. some of them will try to push for higher priced but he's more down to earth. The angel hair scallop is excellent. Rubato carpaccio is ok. We had OP Ribs which was really good. Make sure it's med rare! Rubato Pizza was also not bad. We missed the desserts as we were too full but will definitely be back. Pricing was not too bad but on the pricey side
5
The food was tasty, and the portions were just nice. The service was warm and attentive, with a cheerful air. The overall ambience was most suited to a merry party of friends and family. I would return to try more of their dishes... even if the profiteroles were not quite up to the mark! The pannacotta did hit the spot though
5
Had another awesome meal here with another couple and we were extremely pleased with Sam's recommendations and service. For the record, we were all of Italian ancestry.
5
It’s a great place for families to dine in on Sunday for lunch. They serve good pizza and they have friendly service staffs.
5
Delicious menu with pasta offerings , I am taken aback with the authenticity of this restaurant> It feel likes you are hsving delicious italian chef pastas served, Remarkable portions
4
An excellent start with the cold Angel Hair Pasta followed by the tomahawk and ended with the divine molten chocolate cake accompanied with a delicious vanilla ice cream. The mushroom soup was also delicious. Full of flavour with depth. Wonderful.
4
The food and the ambience were good! Had a wonderful and pleasant dinner. The service still has room for improvement though. But overall a good dining experience!
4
Management are extremely nice the wait staff I find are nice but be careful they like to push drinks on you specially wine. There wines are nice but like everything in Singapore extremely expensive as well as the food. But I find the food and ambiance is worth it compared to other restaurants in Singapore that are Italian. Again it is Singapore so everything is expensive.
4
We came with a group of 7 adults, and customer service and serving of food was prompt. There was also a free valet service so that was lovely. Upon ordering we initially wanted to order an individual main for each of us, but the waiter took out a different menu and suggested for us to try their more popular food items for sharing, and then add on more orders if the food wasn't enough. We still decided with our own orders as we wanted a bigger variety. Food was good overall, although not really worth paying for with regards to its quality
4
Enjoyed the Lamb Chop, Steak n Squid Ink Risotto tremendously, but was alittle taken aback by the service crew. Felt like we ve entered into a Sales Presentation, could cut back alittle on getting us to try the Expensive stuff!! Overall experience is still a plesant one, with the crew singing a lovely Birthday Song to our frien
2
My family of 5 had a variety of dishes like the Burrata Parma Ham, angel Hair pasta, ribs, mushroom pizza, squid ink pasta and 2 desserts. Food was nice but we regretted not asking the price of the ribs which was not on the menu. The ribs which was highly recommended by the waiter cost $219 which was quite unexpected and frankly not worth that price. We went on Christmas Day and although the restaurant was not that crowded and there were tables which were empty the whole time we were there, the five of us was made to squeeze for a seat meant for 4. So there was 3 of us on squeezing on the sofa seats surrounded by other people which made our meal quite unpleasant. Also, it did seem like the waiter was pushing us to order stuff at the convenience of the kitchen. Subsequently we tried ordering a few other dishes which were not recommended but they were all “sold out”.In general food was good but not fantastic and since the ambience and service was considered bad when I went, most likely not going back again
2
Friendly staff, cool & comfortable indoor tables. Child friendly. Wonderful menu selections - dishes did not all come out on time so some of our table of 6 were left waiting to begin until we worked out a dish had been overlooked. We all enjoyed our selections but found it strange to have to use same cutlery for Main as for starters. Had to ask for water glasses to be replenished which was also odd considering the heat. Overall would return but will be better prepared when waiter asks for donations to his money around the world collection. Novel way of ensuring a tip. He’s looking for US 
4
Angelhair pasta was unique and the scallops were delectable. Seafood in a bag was good as well but the rubato chicken was very mediocre.
Also, be careful when specifying the type of water you want or they will open a bottle of Evian for you.
1
The steak has got to be one of the worst steak i have ever tasted, it is very rubbery filled with tendons that were impossible to cut through. even after we feedback to the waiter and he brought it back, it was still as bad.
5
Tried the angel's hair pasta, seafood in the bag and tiger prawn pasta. Different but taste great in their own ways. The staffs were all friendly and welcoming making the experience at rubato a complete one.
5
the ambience is good, the food was awesome. My partner loves the lambof rack while I preferred more on the squid ink seafood risotto.
2
The grilled eggplant was not well grilled and there was only four slices of eggplant. I was informed that the Iberico pork would be done medium rare, but it was not even pink when it came. Given that the eggplant was not well grilled, I was actually relieved that the pork was well done
5
Food was amazing and staff were friendly and prompt. There was certainly no issues with lack of service. The staff at our table created such a fun atmosphere which added to our experience there. The grilled seafood was perfect as was our huge t-bone to share. Will definitely return
3
We ordered lamb chop, parma ham linguine pasta and laca chocolate cake. Lamb chops were too fatty and scattered with charred bits. Food quality was average and didn’t justify the price. The music played by the DJ was too noisy for a relaxing evening. Place more suitable for young people.
2
My wife and I were told of the great food here and if this review were solely based on quality of food then it certainly didn’t disappoint. Standouts in particular were the mains we had - the seafood risotto was certainly one of the best we’ve had, and the Iberico pork was just melt-in-your mouth divine.Service however was just terrible. Our reservation for two for an inside table (which had been confirmed by the restaurant mind you) was met by a brusque “can I give you a table outside? Our inside tables are very packed tonight” by the hostess upon our reaching the front of the house. Doesn’t matter that it was 6.30pm, we had a reservation and the “inside” was not even half full. When we reminded her that our reservation was for an inside table we were then ignored for a table of five who had clearly arrived behind us. I was then somehow inexplicably told that the hostess would seat them before my Wife and I. The server at our table was also rather pushy. Having decided beforehand that we wanted to have an appetiser (the angel hair pasta), a sharing plate (the excellently cooked octopus), a soup (bit-too-salty lobster bisque), burrata (which had such a good burst of flavours) and the seafood risotto, the server kept pushing us to also order the 900g T-bone steak. When I replied that it would be too much food, we were somehow convinced that the aforementioned 5 dishes we had planned to have was not enough and we went on to order the iberico pork. Quality aside (given that it was really good), the Wife and I were simply too full to enjoy all the food by the end of the night. There was also no space for dessert at all (which we had initially planned to have). Oh and our drinks orders were forgotten till some time later and we had to remind them of our order. Probably because the server was trying to force on us the close-to-one-kilogram t-bone that we just didn’t want.Price-wise we spent close to $300 for the meal. Were it based solely on the quality of the food with just average basic service you’d expect from a restaurant, we wouldn’t have been so sore. Given the overall experience we had though, we came away feeling we overpaid by at least half the bill.For the price you’re honestly better off eating at a place with equally good food but much better service
2
Truffle scallop pasta was terrible. Fake truffle overload, which made it taste like nail polish. Well you cant expect real truffles at $50, so please cater your expectations. We didnt bother finishing. Squid ink pasta was just so-so.Only saving grace was the Pizza with burrata cheese.Have had better Italian fare. Unlikely to return
2
Such an awful service. Nobody is really looking after one table so it’s out of luck and a lot of reminders that we got the wrong drinks ( after the starter ).Food was just ok. Definitely no Italian flair in this place.Far too expensive for what it is
5
It was crowded on weekends. Nevertheless food was good. Taste of Iberico Pork exceed my expectation.
5
Its a little on the pricey side but every dish ordered was worth the price paid for. The restaurant’s must try are the angel hair pasta & the seafood risotto. Staffs are engaging and friendly, attending your needs often
4
Was recommended by friends to give this establishment a try as they provided authentic Italian flavours! And all I can say, is that I was not disappointed! The food was exemplary and the service provided by the waiters were impeccable. Would highly recommend to others!
5
Super friendly place. With fabulous food and incredibly friendly service and attention. Made us feel at home and even allowed us to play the guitar and have a great time. Wine options were fantastic and prices very reasonable.
Super recommended
4
Service was great. Serving is bit fast due to busy night I guessed.
Pink base pasta was good. Flexible to change the topping for the pizza.
Wine list is limited and bit over priced.
3
Overall pretty good quality and reasonable prices... but not five stars by any imaginable metric. Ok but not great
5
I went there for my anniversary dinner and was greeted by polite staff and they have provided an awesome service by giving recommendations on what to order. When the food was served, we were able to appreciate the different tastes of the ingredients by itself and even when combined. The staff ensured that they checked if the food was up to our satisfaction. The whole experience was really nice and we will definitely go back for another meal
5
This was my first time at Rubato and I loved everything about it. The ambience and service were great and the food was phenomenal. We asked the waiters for suggestions and they were very friendly and definitely suggested the right thing. Hats off to Sheila, who was standing there and managing everything with a lovely smile. I would definitely recommend this place and go there again too

Appalled by their unprofessional service.1) Uncomfortable with the way they try to push items on the menu to customers. When ordering, the waiter kept on asking us what we wanted for drinks. We had to tell him several times we didn’t want drinks, and when we proceeded to order our mains, he still said: “no no, drinks first”. Seems like we weren’t the only ones - the lady boss also kept on pushing drinks to the table beside us. And based on other one and two star reviews, this seems to be a trend that customers experience. 2) All our mains arrived together, except for our T-bone steak which we ordered to share. We assumed they forgot the order because it still had not arrived by the time we finished eating our mains. No biggie, orders are forgotten all the time. Just cancel, we thought. But when we told them to cancel the order if they hadn’t cooked it already, they checked their iPad and deliberated for a while before assuring us that it was on the way - it took a long time because pastas cook very quickly whereas they were “cooking the steak slowly for us”, the water said. Not convinced - which restaurant “cooks steak slowly”??? 3) When we got the bill, they asked: “Do you have any comments about the food or about the late service?”. We told them the pastas were a bit too salty (ya, still trying to be polite), and the waiter’s response was: “Oh the squid ink pasta is salty because squid ink naturally has a salty taste”. I then went on to say: “Actually it was way too salty”. His reply? “Oh no Mdm, you see, seafood is from the the sea, the sea is salty so naturally these dishes will be salty”. The entire table was stunned. First of all, anyone who has tasted pure squid ink before knows that it is completely void of saltiness. And secondly, why would a waiter ask for feedback if they’re just going to be so defensive about our comments? They seemed keen for customers to give a TripAdvisor review so here’s mine. Wonder what they’re going to say about my feedback - will they be defensive? Or take it humbly and work on improving their service? I really hope they do something about it, even if my experience wasn’t the norm in their restaurant.

Cold angel heart pasta with truffle oil and Hokkaido scallops was truly divine. Warm pumpkin was a inspired choice to accompany the beautiful Burrata. Surprised by how generous the portions were for the appetizers - truly value for money.Main course was perfectly done T bone Florentine - yum yum yum! Menu is extensive. Service was warm and enthusiastic . Perfect for midweek chill out dinne
5
Visited this place for a dinner with my colleagues. I'm impressed by the food! The angel hair scallop, ham and burrata, octopus, squid ink risotto, fish, pork and dessert are delicious! Would like to revisit again if I have a chance.
5
We'll always return because the food is nice, ambiance & service is fantastic. Keep up the good work!
4
Lovely atmosphere, delicious food (burrata, crab angel hair pasta, creme brûlée). Don’t order the profiteroles!!! Looked appalling, and tasted how it looked.
Wait staff were hit and miss.
5
Great quality food, real generous portions and superb service! The waiter was so nice! Look for sham if your are here! He will make great recommendations
5
A hidden gem of a restaurant! We had the slow braised spanish octopus and parma on the rocks for starters and the vongole and Burrata pizza for the main. They were all delicious! premium quality ingredients were used and definitely made the difference! Unfortunately we didn’t have time to take pictures of the food, cause we snapped it up fast, except for the baked Alaska! I found my composure to take a pic of it before This place definitely warrants repeat visits!
5
Date night extraordinaire. We walked past this place recently and were invited in but had just eaten. We decided to pay a visit and I have to say it’s a hidden gem.The Spaghetti Vongole was simply the best I’ve ever tasted, it was great to watch the kitchen team hard at work and the whole experience and ambience was well worth the visit.Make sure your hostess Sheila welcomes you she’s a characte
5
Made a reservation for 7 Pax for a friend's birthday dinner yesterday at Rubato and was impressed by the impeccable service accorded to us by the service staff. They were very happy to assist us in organising this event from the start to the finish. I find it really sincere that the chef comes out personally to introduce their specials for the evening to each and every table - it simply adds a lot of personal touch. Needless to say the food was impressive as usual and the ambience was perfect. The service staff made me look very good as the host for the evening (as they had even prepared a slice of cake on the house for the birthday) Would definitely love to dine at Rubato again - this restaurant comes with my highest recommendations
5
Have been here a few times now and Rubato always surprises me! Their attention to detail and thought put into cooking - to make the flavours come together really well and ingredients compliment each other is commendable! Would highly recommend their charcoal grilled squid and lobster pasta! Will be back for more
3
Rubato used to me our go to restaurant when it comes to Italian. We have several good experiences. However, our dinner yesterday was not good. With the exception of the Burrata, the soup, risotto and pizza were all too salty for our liking. The over use of salt really spoiled the dinner.
5
My hubby and I had dinner at Rubato to celebrate our wedding anniversary and were so impressed with the food quality and the service that we brought our son back for dinner the following fortnight! On both occasions, every dish we had was divine - A Gift From The Angels, The Black Footed Bear, Charcoal Grilled Rack of Lamb, Beef Tenderloin, Live Maine Lobster, and a venison special of the day. The service was impeccable and Sham gave great recommendations as well as made sure that all our needs were promptly attended to. The owners Marcus and Sheila were warm and friendly and found time to make us feel at home despite the busy night. We will definitely be back for more
5
Really good. Though a little salty, the texture and the creaminess of the pasta is just superb. Really lovely!
5
Well, I really love pizza, I can not miss a restaurant that would not try it! And it is very tasty here, just lick your fingers!
5
Let me first start off by saying this was the best medium rare steak since Argentina. It was perfect medium rare. PERFECT.We opted for a 5-course +1 degustation, amongst all the italian places we have celebrated all our important occasions at, this meal came in a close second (to a gusto italian event at basilico)but at a much more affordable price (maybe cause we didn't order much wine).So why was i willing to leave a tip even though I almost never did anywhere else. And honestly it was the best italian meal I have had years (even without their famed Michelin grade burrata!)1. He took note of our request for no cheese and no crustaceans. He replaced them with more than what we expected. 2. When the first dish arrived (cold angel hair pasta with scallops, nori seaweed, and truffle oil), he told me to let him know if I wanted more. We then asked how much were the oysters because we knew it wasn't in the degustation, he said no worries and how many we wanted (thats where the +1 course came from). We had 2 each.3. Slow braised octopus. Crispy skin seared Snapper. Then that perfect steak. Finished with a platter of perfect authentic italian desserts (tiramisu, panna cotta, molten lava cake, and ice cream) 4. They surprised me with a birthday tiramisu.and it was the best tiramisu I had in years (the espresso soaked sponge, tinge of alcohol, thick mascarpone, and the shamelessly excessive cocoa powder)5. They constantly apologised for their slow service which was partly true even though they ran from table to table and ensured that each customer was satisfied before moving on to the next one. And well the kitchen was literally on fire. They delivered fast and furious.6. Kudos to the guy that did our steaks and the impeccable service who answered every beck and call and still managed to make it all very personal and positive. We will be back for the burratas, pastas and pizzas
2
Went there regularly, but since the last 6 month or so the service got horrible. A lot of new faces didnt make it better. Poor and unpolite service, thats it. Why i still give 2 points, because the quality of the food is still very good.But they wont see me anymore, value for money ratio is totally bad
2
Staff who took our orders continuously only recommended the most expensive items in the menu and specials of the day. Staff was also very inattentive throughout . They spent time chatting with each other and did not look in the directions of the customers.I had also requested friend s dessert to have a candle as it was his birthday celebration but all these were not done.
4
A cool Italian restaurant where you feel so welcome and the food is simply . . . !The owner Aunty Sheila often try her best to receive you when you step into her restaurant. Her warm welcome and attention throughout the meal is so rare and you simply appreciate her attention. Aunty Sheila, rest assured we will be back :
3
Dine in Rubato again after my last visit 2 months ago. Lots of changes in this restaurant, I guess they changed their management. The menu changed, the price increased by more than 2 times. The staff changed, I personally prefer the old staffs. Food quality still the same as some of the Chefs are still there. Overall not so impress with the changes of this restaurant. I prefer the old Rubato.
5
Tried a new dish- Jumbo Crab Lumps Angel Hair Pasta & it was superb. The Lamb Rack wasn't up to standard this time. Occasionally Rubarto gives 15% discount card for next visit use but they didn't give us on this visit. Though valid for a short while but it does encourage repeat visits.
4
The Margherita pizza is quite authentic Naples but obviously not as nice as in Naples. Cheese did not sizzle.The angel hair cold pasta with scallops and truffle oil was excellent.Crabmeat angel hair pasta aglio olio was very good.Burrata ravioli was good.Flourless chocolate cake and macadamia tart were very good, while tiramisu was decent.Service was friendly and helpful.Complimentary valet parking
1
I complained that the steak wasn't done medium rare and sent it back. The chef refused to change it for us and sliced the steak for us to "prove" that it was medium rare. Horrible customer service and this isn't the way that you should treat your customer.
3
After ready few positive feedback, we decided to have gathering here with bunch of friends. Everything was well, nothing disappointed us. The ambience was good. Such an awesome place to chill and relax with friends or family.
4
Love the place!! Our first time and will surely go back there for more excellent food! Family friendly too. Thank you Shirley for chatting, explaining to us the different items on the menu.
We will be back:)
4
Food, atmosphere and service were good. People serving were friendly and helpful. There is a wide variety of food choices
5
Brought my family with 2 kids there. The kids really enjoy the cooking through the kitchen window. Loving the mushroom soup, the more cheese, please pizza and the risotto. Special compliment to the chef, being very professional and observant, to make sure that every customer at any corner enjoy the best experience in the restaurant.
5
I absolutely love the food and the service was excellent. The staff were really really nice. The food did not take very long to come but it wasn't SUPER fast. The food was really pleasing. Although it was a bit pricey, i would say that the food was definitely worth the price. The staff also gave my father a surprise birthday cake and altogether, pleasant experience. Would definitely recommend anyone to go there, be it Singaporean or tourist:)
5
My wife and I went to this restaurant yesterday. We are used to go to other restaurants at Greenwood and we just wanted to have a new experience. We have had a warmly welcome and had a nice table outdoor. The food was very tasty with fresh ingredients and portions are good for the food and the wine by the glass. We have had the burrata with Parma Ham, the Hokkaido pasta, the grilled vegetable and the Tiramisu and all the dishes have been very tasty and full of flavours. When leaving, we have had a very nice conversation with the owner, Shirley who is very passionate about her restaurant and its philosophy to have the best Italian food at an affordable price. We will definitively come back with the kids and we will become for sure regular customers
5
Went for a casual Italian dinner with friend. Had a squid ink pasta, pacific clams, hawaiian pizza and grilled pumpkin. Food tasted great, with fresh ingredients used. Portions were also about the right size (I am not a small eater by the way). Service was also good. Staff and owner were friendly and professional, ensuring that we had a good experience there. Overall, would go back again
5
Had a very enjoyable meal thanks to Rubato! Food was very good and service was great.Due to our group of 5 adults, we were initially seating near the entrance, under the air-conditioner. However, due to the condensation, it was dripping and the staff moved us inside. Despite it being slightly more squeezy, it didn't really matter to as as we preferred the new location. The staff also gave us a small discount to the meal which we appreciate.One small note is that the service of food was slightly slow but this was attributed to the high demand of the restaurant.I will highly recommended Rubato!
5
Went to rubato for a casual Italian dinner, however both the food and service surpassed my expectations. The servers were all extremely cordial and pleasant, and frequently asked us on how we found the food - which was excellent! Absolutely beyond words. Yes, I do admit that it's slightly pricey but they are very generous with the portions (1 dish can feed at least 2-3 people!), and not to mention, their food (especially the seafood) are specially imported from other countries to ensure quality and freshness. Complementary pizza-like bread was served - tasty for an appetiser! I had seared salmon, which was on the special menu for that night, and the salmon was perfectly cooked, soft, yet slightly crispy. It doesn't give one a bloated or overwhelming feeling at all. Desserts were a thumbs up as well, delicious, yet not so rich or overly sweet. Overall, the experience there was close to perfect and I enjoyed the food and service very much. Highly recommended

We went to Rubato for lunch this weekend in hoping for some good but not fancy Italian good. The restaurant looks nice from the outside, however, the inside was not very clean. We noticed a table with some stains on the table cloth. We have vegetarian requirements but our waiter was always busy and would only give us one example of vegetarian choice in each category and quickly walk off as if we have some kind of decease. Later we asked him to take a photo for us he said OK but quickly went to another table to take orders until we find some else to help us.We ordered some appetisers to share and pasta and pizza for the main courses. The appetisers taste all very much alike with the same kind of grilled vegetables and so does the vegetarian pizza. The gnocchi was good with cream sauce but fills up the stomach very fast. Sea food in a bag and the lobster pasta are nicely presented. However, with the price around 250 for four people, we could easily get a set menu or an ordinary meal at a descent Italian restaurant with good service.In all, Rubato is an Italian diner with low hygiene, average food, high price and arrogant and always busy waiters. I have no idea how this place is still surviving in the highly competitive food and beverage industry
4
Rubato is a welcomed addition to the Greenwod neighbourhood. We love the bright airy feel of the place and the decor. The food is consistently good and they have a solid wine list. Great service too!
4
I recommend the wild mushroom soup and anything from the Chef's Special. Had a pasta, pizza and 2 steak from the chef's special and it was delicious. Very friendly and attentive staff.
5
Lovely, open concept restaurant. Very personable service. Spaghetti alle Vongole and Burrata Ravioli were standout dishes. Good wine selections. Particularly good deserts. Valet parking was a great help. Reasonable prices as well. A winner.
Very nice service by Sheila as well.
5
The food was awesome. Great atmosphere. Special thanks to Sheila who recommend us the special menu of the day :)
5
Visited Rubato several times and we still love the food. Our all time favorites are 'Parma on the rock', 'Lobster soup' and 'Wild boar foot'. Don't remember the exact dish names though. But we'll always miss the food and come back once a month or 2. The staff are friendly and the service is good. Restaurant is cozy but aircon is often too cold and parking is limited
4
After reading several positive reviews, decided to pay it a visit for dinner with the family. I was not disappointed.The place had a nice relaxed feel, and good for family conversations. Service was attentive. Sheila, who appears to be the proprietress, was very personable.Food-wise, most enjoyable for us were the barbequed pork ribs (meat especially succulent), and the Maine lobster with angel-hair pasta (very good combo). They were well accompanied by a bottle of red wine (a nice recommendation by the house).Looking forward to the next visit

PROS: Service, Food, DecorCONS: Secluded location (could be a PRO too)WHO: Dear Wife and I (30s)WHEN: Sunday eveningRubato is strategically placed in a rich man’s enclave somewhere in Greenwood Ave. I would have passed the car keys to the valet but we arrived by taxi so that would’ve been rude. The place was beautiful – almost new even. I made a mental note of their pretty mosaic pillars and bright interiors for my new kitchen.Greeting us was Ms Sheila, whom I presume, was the manager. Sheila has the poise and bearing of someone who has dedicated her life to hospitality. DW said she was probably a stewardess a lifetime ago. Throughout the evening we were dutifully summoned by her charm and bubbly anecdotes about the who’s-who of Singapore (from actors to the president) who’d made the restaurant their favourite. I later added that they now can name-drop me should they be inclined to share an anecdote of who’s-not in Singapore. Taking over at the table was Shem. Attentive and cheerful, he made sure the food arrived on time and our glasses remain filled. He’s a nice guy. The two of us had the following:-- Beef Carpaccio: The portion was generous to the point I thought it was a plate-sized piece of meat because I couldn’t see the plate. Well-seasoned. No complaints. - Grilled squid: Maybe the squid just left the gym when it was caught as it was slightly tough. Could do with more EVOO too. The weakest of the night. - Ribeye Steak (250gm/Med-Rare): Properly seasoned. Doneness was on point. Came with no sauce. Needed no sauce. A winner.- Spaghetti alle Vongole: Perfect pasta, fresh clams and just enough white wine in the sauce to complement them both. Probably the best we’ve had in Singapore. The star of the night. - Chocolate Gelato: Home made? Well made. - Tiramisu: Not the best but traditional enough. Top 3 in my book.- Molten Lava Cake: Nice bitterness and not too sweet. Unfortunately same for the strawberries. - Panna Cotta: Mango sorbet was a nice touch. Creamy and rich.- Chianti / Prosecco / Limoncello: The Chianti met my budget and was perfect with the carpaccio but couldn’t hold its own against the steak. Not my best attempt at pairing. The prosecco and limoncello were indulgences. We deserved it. Lol.I have to confess that some of the above were complimentary, courtesy of the management. And I admit, this did influence my review on the restaurant. But not in the sense that I was bribed into it but more towards how my entire experience here reminded me so much of Italy. I recalled how the owners/chefs there would ask how everything was and when you say it’s good, they’d return to the kitchen to fetch something else so that you’d swear it’s excellent. They wouldn’t think twice about sharing an extra course, or at most times, an extra decanter or two of their house vino. So proud are they of their cooking, they need you to know that too. Ultimately, their only wish is that you sincerely had a really good time. I miss that. I miss being in an establishment where they take so much pride in what they do. It elevates the experience from just a normal dinner to one that transports you into the culture the cuisine represents. It makes me want Rubato to succeed so bad because places like this, are few and far between. And reading how small the margins can be for those in the food business here, I can’t help but be grateful to be chosen to enjoy such a privilege. In a country where every cent counts, spending that little extra to make a guest happy should put you head and shoulders above your peers. For that and more, I believe this place deserves 5-stars for the effort and dedication they put into their work and the joy they have brought to both my wife and I that evening. Total Cost: $277Verdict: Will be coming back whenever we need an Italian fix. TIPS: Make reservations

We had a memorable dining experience in Rubato. Their service was top class, one of the best I had experienced in Singapore. Special thanks to Mohan for introducing us their Menu. He is very helpful and attentive. Also thanks to Sheila for making us feel welcome in their restaurant. Foods were delicious. Super like their Angel Hairs Hokkaido Scallop and Burrata. These two dishes will definitely make me go back there again. Thanks Rubato for the wonderful Italian dining experience

Most places, sometimes you get hits, sometimes misses. Here at Rubato so far it's only been hits each time! Love coming back over & over again for the quality food & exceptional service! Special mention to Sheila who makes you feel at home with her impeccable service, also Fred & the entire team are so wonderful & humorous! Love the seasonal seafood choices & I highly recommend the angel hair topped with fresh scallops in truffle oil starter. My friends & I definitely have to have it on each visit!Planning to be back soon with my business associates

My gf and I are both regular customers of this restaurant. The food there is amazing. My personal favourite dish from the menu is "Seafood in the bag". If you think dishes on the menu are too boring, then you could try "today's special". I am sure you will find something nice
5
Italian food with great company
Soup: lobster cappuccino - rich and creamy
Main: black tagliatelle pasta with river King prawn - squid ink pasta with tomatoes sauce. Highly recommended!
Dessert: Rubato's classic molten chocolate cake - warm cake with oozing chocolate
Great ambience!
5
I enjoyed the companionship with friends. The food is nice especially the Michellin quality burrata
Thumbs up!
5
good food. friendly staffs, especially Sheila...lovely lady. will definitely visit again and recommend this place to everyone.😊
5
One of my favourite Italian restaurant for squid ink pasta. Do give the calamari and tiramisu a try too.
4
Soups were great, squid ink pastas were amazing! Had to keep getting servers attention and it would be nice if they didn't keep trying to upsell their pricier food.
3
Went for my daughter's birthday celebration. Good ambient, food quality average but a little pricy. Prepare min $50 pp for a simple meal.
5
Great service, outstanding food, good value - there's nothing not to like about Rubato's which is why so many people (including me) single it out as one of their all-time fave haunts in Singapore.
5
Top-notch italian cuisine - The truffles angel-hair pasta made an impact from the first bite! Pizza was crisp, cheesy and overflowing with ingredients. Barramundi was flavourful with a freshness the sea. Ended the experience with a delightful tiramisu dessert... Quaint location and great ambience! Service staff was attentive and helpful. Awesome gastro experience through and through!!! Will come back again

Brought a friend from New Zealand to this place for dinner together with my family. There were altogether five of us. We ordered a chicken main course as starter for the five of us to share as my friend loved chicken. Each of us order a pasta and we also ordered two pizzas to share. This is not the first time that I have been to Rubato. I can't quite remember exactly but I would guess probably the 4th or 5th time. As usual, to say that the food did not disappoint was a gross understatement. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. The ambiance was very pleasant and conducive for carrying on our conversation, The service is not particularly outstanding but is generally good. There is one particular aspect of the service which is extremely annoying. We noticed that each time when we were placing our orders, the serving staff would WITHOUT FAIL, attempt to channel our orders to the most expensive items on the menu. We fell for the trick in the initial visits but have since wised up to their maneuvers. I honestly hope that the restaurant would stop such manipulations so as not to blemish an otherwise wonderful dinning experience
5
Very enjoyable mid week lunch at Rubato. Very reasonably priced set menu for lunch or ala carte menu available. Lovely courteous service and the very elegant decor makes you feel quite special. My meal was very tasty and dessert was a delight. Highly recommend a visit. Street parking was very easy mid week.
5
Extremely delicious food (especially the T bone steak). Well portioned and nicely cooked, meat was tender.
Service is tops - attentive and friendly. Mentions coming up (Sheila and Sham)
Overall, i would highly recommend Rubato for family and friends gathering
A must try!
5
Really delicious food.
Enjoyed the ambience. Also enjoyed the food.
Brought my mother for mother's day. she really enjoyed it.
5
This place is a gem in the bukit timah neighborhood. Their risotto and carbonara is to die for. And super great service !
5
Kudos to the service staff and chef for assisting us during our recent visit.
We change some items on the.menu and they were very accommodating.
5
Went here with family for a celebration and was very happy with the overall dining experience. Being in the outskirts of the city makes Rubato a hidden gem very much worth adventuring to. Tranquil and easy to reach by car.The 4 of us only had a few appetizers and pastas, but from that we can tell the food in Rubato was without doubt superb! Everything looks and tastes fresh and gives off that authentic Italian vibe. The burrata stood out for me and I would recommend that! The service was also fantastic thanks to Sheila and Cham. I like that they go out of the way to explain to you about the food, which led us to order their scallop angel hair pasta as an appetizer that was delicious.
5
My wife and are foodies and have tried many good italian restaurants in Singapore. Rubato is one of the top italian place at a reasonable price. Food was excellent and they went the extra mile to split the food we ordered. Service was exemplary and attentive. We had a great time and will be back for more. Keep it up, Marcus and Team..
5
Don't know why I have never been! Went for the first time last night with some girl friends and had a fabulous meal sitting outside. I ate a few things I knew my Husband and kids would love so went back for dinner tonight. They loved it so we are going to be regulars. Not too pricey for singapore standards so easy to go to regularly without feeling over indulgent although the food is yummy. So far I recommend Angel hair truffle pasta with scallops Seafood Spaghetti in a bagHalloumi salad which has yummy with red wine soaked grapes and fresh sundried tomatoea to name a few highlight
5
We're a group of 5 girls looking for good food and we found it right here @ Rubato!Ordered dishes to share, we had the Haloumi Salad which was divine. Their signature AngelHair pasta with truffles and scallops was so good we had to order that dish twice. The prawn salad with spinach n sun-dried tomatoes, and their grilled octopus never disappoint. We left 5 happy campers and looks like we're definitely come back for more!
5
Its was always great Italian cuisine surrounded by great smiles n services. Very fairly priced for such an amazing food. Specially thank Sheila @ Rubato for always making us feel like home.....all the best always to RUBATO's team!. MUST GO..cheers, Sienny,Amir , Andre n the happy families

I reviewed this spot some time ago but it deserves another mention because of its consistency. The staff may change, but the overall formula sticks. Since my first review, we have been back many times as a couple, with larger groups, with just a mate or two. Most recently for a beer after work on a Friday, nothing more; and also for a glass of red with a shared dessert (great tiramisu) after eating elsewhere. It is that kind of place. Just a beer. Just one dish. A three course meal. Couple or a group. Every time, it works. It is not the cheapest option, nor the best Italian food you will ever have, but certainly enjoyable. And consistent. Special mention to new waiter Gerry originally from Penang, continuing the friendly tradition of his birthplace and of this restaurant in suburban Singapore.
5
I recently ate here with some local friends and the meal was quite excellent in every respect. Immediate valet parking made arrival at the restaurant very easy and we were shown directly to our table and the day's menu was explained.
5
I went here for a late lunch/early dinner, and both the service and food were excellent. Each course came out promptly and Shelia went the extra mile to ensure I was comfortable and enjoying my meal. Definitely recommend.
5
Very chilled vibes, great hospitality by the crew & friendly service makes you feel like home! Good Italian food & alcohol :-) everything is perfect & all good at rubato!!
5
Sheila and Ari were very flexible and prepared exactly the dish we requested.
Food was of an excellent quality and very yummy.
5
BURATA was absolutely amazing! Top quality, as an Italian made me feel so at home. Jerry and Sheila provided amazing service. Especially fond of the home made Sun dried tomatoes! Will definitely return for more!
3
Expensive food for what you get. It's a nice venue, though. Staff not super friendly, but fine. Seating is nice.
5
Thanks Sheila for a great dinner
Excellent service and excellent food as always for family and friends
5
I visited Rubato during my trip to Singapore, after friends suggested the place.I must admit, I was not let down. The food was exquisite and the manager Sheila as well as the waiter Jerry were very welcoming. We mentioned how nice the sundries tomatoes (the burrato was hands down the best I've tried) and before we knew it, Sheila had brought us a small bowl of extras for the table. Rubato is for anyone looking for authentic Italian food in Singapore.
4
Nice restaurant with good atmosphere, the food is off decent quality. Off course with Italian food little can go wrong, but apart from the high quality ingredients they use, it doesn't come close to a real Italian restaurant. Small items are missing like a spoon for eating pasta, pepper and oil on the table, basil on the caprese salad, drinks coming after the first dish. Small things missing to get 5 stars
5
The whole atmosphere was just wonderful and the service staff was very polite. My partner and I ordered the oysters, which was very fresh. And lobster bisque which was rich in flavour for our starters.As for the main dish, the lamb rack was very tasty, my partner had the squid ink risotto which was very unique. And dessert the chocolate molten lava cake with vanilla, just ended the night perfect for us
5
Everything we tried did not disappoint...
Highly recommended...especially the Cold angel-hair pasta with hokkaido scallops was refreshing...enjoyed our visit there. Great friendly warm service and recommendations both from waiter and restaurant GM Sheila.
5
Awesome wine selection, good quality food and great service. A shout out to Sheila Garnell for her warm hospitality
5
Good food - love "The Black Pasta" and the "Angel's Breath" Tiramisu. One of the specials of the day was "Octopus Salad" - unique taste and flavourful.
5
Great service by shelie. Very friendly and kind. Would recommend this place for hang out and casual talk
5
Amazing food quality for a very reasonable price. Service was exceptional with very friendly staff. Best Burrata I've ever eaten, perfect balance of bite and creaminess. Angel Hair pasta with Scallops was extremely fragrant with the use of truffle oil, scallops were very well cooked. Ribeye Steak was very tender and flavourful. Overall great experience with great food and service at a reasonable price which is not easy to find
5
We made an impromptu trip to Greenwood Avenue and were delighted to find Rubato - an Italian gem in beautiful sunny Singapore. We ate delicious pizza and pasta carbonara, the pizza was thin, crisp and full of flavour - as good as any I've eaten in Italy. The pasta was al dente and coated in silky creamy sauce. Not only was the food delicious but the service was superb, the general manager Sheila is very charming. We hear they do great lunch deals so we'll definitely be back.
5
Ordered mushroom pizza, black pasta, seafood spaghetti in a bag and tiramisu. The taste of the 3 dishes were fantastic. Full of flavour and overall presentation was appealing. Also, the staff were friendly and polite. They patiently introduced the various daily specials as well as the customisable option available. Would definitely return agai
5
Went to this place thinking of a simple dinner with friends, and was blown away by the hospitality of the staff, and ambience of the place, and the delicious food! It's really hard to find a blend of all 3 and Rubato fits it all! Prices are really decent as well! Pay it a visit, you will find it's all worth it
5
Nested in the Greenwood cluster of restaurants, Rubato is a great place to enjoy Italian food. You will find the great ingredients of Italian gastronomy: excellent products and most important kind and friendly service. The staff is among the most welcoming in Singapore.Go there to experience, you won't regret!
4
We recently moved to the neighbourhood and Rubato has become our family favourite to go restaurant at Greenwood. They have great pizzas/pastas for kids and adults, but what always makes us come back are their amazing Cold angel hair pasta with scallops and truffles (perfect dish for Singapore's hot weather) and their Burrata with Parma ham salad (pricey but so worthwhile because of the excellent quality and generous helping). Their desserts is are must try too! Sheila the manager is real friendly and the staff provides wonderful service and are good with the kids. The black and white decor is simple yet comfortable. In a cool night, it's nice to sit out on the front terrace. Highly recommended.
5
The food they serve is really authentic and fresh... we have been going back often for their seafood risotto, pasta in a bag and pizzas
5
Came by for a quaint Sunday dinner with parents and wife. Thoroughly enjoyed the food. We were hosted by Sheila who was extremely friendly and came to check in on us from time to time. This hidden gem is highly recommended !
3
Mussels in white wine is average but the cold Angel hair pasta with scallops and 24 hr braised lamp shank are a must try. Service was however very good but not sure if it was a quiet night with only 4 tables filled.
5
Was there to celebrate my Boyfriend birthday and was really impressed with their service! Tiramisu was done up nicely with birthday wordings as requested, love their Vongole spaghetti. Will visit again to try on their other menus!
4
Rubato is a good place for Italian dinner .
Plenty of parking if you come before 630, but there are valets .
we always enjoy the grilled squid ,pastas and pizzas .
We also prefer to sit outdoors. Nice ambience and attentive staff.
5
If your looking for a restaurant that serves delicious Italian that provides excellent customer service, rubato is the place for you.The staffs working here aren't just looking for sales, they're looking to build a relationship with their customers which makes them special compared to other restaurants. Especially Sheila and jack.I highly recommend Rubato Modern Italian Trattoria Kitchen & Bar. An outstanding 10/10 rating.- Iglesia
5
Service quality 10/10 especially Sheila and Lily . The most enjoyable moment I had . Try them ! The best service you can find in singapore . You will be surprise, most of them are professional train and knowledgeable on all wine products and they will give you the best appetizer that fits you best .
4
A cafe nested in the middle of a land of landed private houses. Part of a row of Italian eateries, this restaurant serves up decent pasta, al dente as all Italians like it.Pizza was not bad too, but it you want the true smokey taste and smell of woodfired ovens, then you can give the pizzas a miss. If you are not as fussy, do try. We had the seafood bag pasta, carbonara and cheesy pizza (this has blue cheese in it! Which is hard to find out there
5
We wanted a nice and relaxing Sunday lunch after a long busy week, and it was a perfect place to be. Nice atmosphere, relaxing music, nice cool wind, nice coffee & good - above all, I was impressed by a female waiter who showed us such a caring and professional service. I'm glad that we came here - we bought a quality time there. We'll be back again
5
Last night was the second time we ate at Rubato and it once again did not disappoint. Eating at Rubato is a terrific experience in Singapore - excellent food, in a delightful neighborhood, surrounded by other restaurants - the place has a fun buzz. We have particularly enjoyed the garlic bread, Tuscan veggies, and jumbo prawn salad as starters, as well as seafood in a bag pasta and the green pizza for mains. And should you have room, the molten lava cake is delicious as well! If you're looking for a nice, casual night out away from the hustle and bustle of the city, this is your place. Sheila the host and Lily our waitress were brilliant. We will definitely be back! - Matt & Aliss
5
The place is lovely as well as the people. The food there is just insanely awesome. My first time trying the food there today and hopefully can visit there more often to taste other specialities of theirs. Mind blowing restaurant in singapore
5
Awesome pizza! Ruccula and Parma ham with an egg. Definitely will come back to try all their pizzas, pasta and dessert in the menu. Great service too !
5
Fantastic food ... value for money.
Nice ambiance with indoor and outdoor sitting. Friendly and attentive staff.
5
Great service, great food, great ambience.
Definitely worthy of recommendation to come here and give it a try.
5
Tonight our family of six had a great time eating at Rubato. From the time we called to say that we would be late because of the rainy weather, the person on the line assured us that the table would be reserved for us till we get there and that our safety is more important. Take our time ..The minute we arrived, Azan, made us feel so welcomed and focussed his attention on making my parents (who are in their 80s) very comfortable. It is my parents' first time ever eating in an Italian restaurant. So it was a lovely experience for them. Azan's food recommendation from the starters to main course and thereafter desserts was really great. For starters, we had angel hair cold noodles topped with scallop which was yummy and the grilled giant Squid was delicious too. We enjoyed every dish recommended and finished every course almost licked the plates . We enjoyed every bit....cluedos to the chef, the staff and of course, Azan. Thank you for an enjoyable night.
5
Apart from their excellent attention to the food they serve, the service staff also made the dining experience so much more enjoyable. Their senior waitress never failed to check if everything was fine with my meal and also cracked a quick joke to brighten up the meal. Been a regular there, definitely recommended to people looking for a enjoyable evening out for some excellent Italian food.
5
Enjoyed all the dishes served by the friendly staff. Enjoyed the organic mushroom soup which is very special compared with other restaurants. Enjoyed also the big juicy oysters which is hard to come by in Singapore, and is as good as or even better than the ones in Australia (where we live). Peaceful and Relaxing atmosphere
5
We went to Rubato last Wednesday in the evening around 7pm or so. The restaurant already had quite a number of customers and by 8pm was about 70-80% full which is very good for a weeknight. On weekends, we heard that it is 100% full. We ordered Oysters, Mushroom Soup, Garlic Bread, Salmon, Barramundi, Salad, Fries etc and enjoyed the meal very much. We live in Australia so this restaurant is defintely comparable or even much better than similar Italian/Western restaurants in Australia. We would recommend anyone thinking of going to a restaurant for an enoyable time to visit Rubato. You also have a choice of indoor or outdoor seating which is ideal as there is a choice unlike some other restaurants which don't offer this choice. The staff were friendly and nice, and the toilets were clean. Overall, Great ambience
5
Been there a few times though I live quite far away. Service staff are attentive and food is excellent.You've got to try the cold angel hair pasta with Hokkaido scallops, simply divine and a must have every time. Their Burrata pizza and King prawn linguine with crab meat sauce are also my favourites
4
The first thing we noticed was the service. The staff were always smiling and really took care of us. We had the rock melon and parma ham to start, and the Ravioli and Seafood Pasta in Bags as mains. Food was really good and we enjoyed ourselves. Thank you
4
Been there several times and the food is always tasty and staff are always friendly. All in all, Rubato is a nice casual restaurant with that delivers a good dining experience.
5
Great spot for date night or even dinner with a few friends. Food was excellent, service was awesome (Thanks to the friendly Azan who served us and Alice, the Manager). Couldn't have asked for a better night. Thank you.
4
First visit to Rubato since I am around the corner.Black and white, telling you the good old times.Had the seafood soup with a nice tomato based and the homemade bread, you can tell the sincerity from the food.I love how the wait staff assisted- prompt.A very cozy place for dinner over wine, an intimate wedding reception and perhaps any events.I love the chocolate molten cake
5
I've been going to Rubato for a few years and I've never once been disappointed. My last visit to Rubato was for an early Valentines on the 12th of February. I got the Scallops and Parma Ham, which was incredible, as well as the vongole which had a generous amount of clams. What never fails to disappoint is the carbonara, their mushroom soup, and their lava cake. However, what makes Rubato one of my favourite dining spots in Singapore is the excellent customer service. If you're driving, the valet for dining at Rubato is free (parking here can sometimes be very difficult). Their service is consistently outstanding, with friendly staff, especially Ari - who always makes my family and I feel well taken care of. It's also dog-friendly at it's outdoor patio and the staff takes care of our furry companions as much as they take care of us.This is truly one of my favourite places in Singapore and I will highly recommend it
5
Rubato's was recommended to me by my friend Jeanna as she personally knows Marcus who is the executive chef there. After finding out from Jeanna that Rubato's has really great food and service I was eager to try it out for myself and have my family there as well so on my recent trip to Singapore, we decided to make a trip there and Rubato's didn't disappoint. One thing that was very apparent to me upon going in was the vast open kitchen and there's an emphasis on using the freshest ingredients and there's also an emphasis on service quality. Each member of the waitstaff was prompt, attentive and strong in both their delivery of service and their product knowledge. The food was generous and it tasted great and the wines list was extensive and well thought out. Our visit was capped off with a visit from Chef Marcus and he has a real sense of pride in Rubato's, in the team that surrounds him in the kitchen and in the dining room, in the food that comes out of the kitchen and in his abilities as a chef. It truly was a pleasure meeting him and I can only hope that I can return to Singapore again and enjoy this amazing restaurant. It was a great night out and I hope that any one that goes looking for great Italian food in Singapore pays a visit her
5
I'm on holiday and Rubato was recommended to me by a few people and it did not disappoint. My family and I were warmly greeted by the staff and were made to feel at home. We had a mixed starter borate cheese and ham which was simply amazing.we had the mussels and oysters again amazing best I've ever had. The kids had pizza which was also fantastic. Fully recommended will definitely visit again
5
I dined at Rubato on the 16th February with my family. It was the best dining experience I have ever had.Our entire party thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The service was amazing in particular Sheila Goh and Marcus were so attentive and incredibly welcoming. The burata and the tenderloin steak was simply out of this world. We also had the oysters as a starter along with squid ink pasta which I would highly recommend. Simply wonderful night and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. You will not be dissappointed
1
Terrible customer service for Valentine's Day 2017. Servers didn't keep track of our main courses. We had to ask 5 times for BREAD before it was served. We asked a waiter to serve the bread once and observed him thereafter, he went on to serve other customers and proceeded to clean the bottoms of the iced water jugs and totally forgot about our request. Basic service like refilling iced water was not prompt. My other half didn't enjoy the service and I felt my $207 net bill that night was a total waste. Food was sub-par for such a huge bill. Utterly dissapointed
4
I visited Rubato last week with my group of friends. I was very happy with the service of the team working - they were very accommodative towards the changes we requested for some dishes (I know some restaurants that are not tolerant of this)! The food tasted great as well and I enjoyed myself a lot. Definitely a place to try if you're looking for Italian food
1
Accordingly to some reviews i found online that was backdated in 2014, there was a snapshot of the menu, the squid ink pasta (that was highly raved) was priced at $17.90 ++, seemed reasonably priced. Since now is 2017, i expect and i could accept a slight inflation on the price of the food. NO. The squid ink pasta is now priced at $26.90++ (with an increase of outrageous $9 more). Beside that, since this is an italian restaurant, shouldn't bread be served as a complimentary starter? NO. There was nothing. I also ordered a "A hint of Spice + Salami" pizza and the description stated "Spicy salami, mozzorella & basil", our pizza came with only 3 pathetic piece of basil leaves. Not to mention that the pizza tasted almost similiar to the taste of the pizza from 7-11, that showed how awful the food was. Do yourself a favor, with the price between $20-$30, bring yourself to a better italian restaurant
5
My friends and I had a great time at Rubato! The food was excellent and the service staff were very helpful. A special thanks to Azan, our friendly waiter! We definitely will re-visit this restaurant in the near future!
5
The first thing that you notice in Rubato's is the service is impeccable. Friendly, helpful and great attention. Shem was our waiter, and would come back just for the excellent service. Food is amazing as well, the angel hair and truffles is a must try.
5
A gem tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood. My parents loved the cold angel hair pasta with hokkaido scallops, Id say they will definitely be ordering it everytime we come here now!
5
The service by the waiters were excellent. They were very polite and accomodated to me and my girlfriend.
5
Service and top notch and food was really good too. Waiters were really helpful throughout the dinner experience.
5
Celebrated my birthday dinner here with a couple of my friends and I enjoyed every bit of it! The ambience was perfect, the food was excellent and the staff portrayed great service as well. I had the carbonara for my main, and I shared the Neapolitan pizza which had the tastiest sundried tomatoes. The molten chocolate cake was one of the best lava cake I've had so far, it's definitely a must try here! Alice aka Sheila Goh, the manager was always making sure things were okay and Azan, did a fantastic job serving us as well. I'll definitely be back for more :
5
The food at this restaurant was incredible! I would recommend every pasta dish on the menu. My friends and I ordered an array of dishes off the pasta menu, and decided to share the dishes between ourselves. I loved the squid ink pasta and the fettuccine felicia. Azan, our waiter, provided us with excellent service. And Alice, who seemed to be the manager of the restaurant, made us feel ever so welcomed as she would drop by our table to check in on us. We will definitely come back again to have another meal at rubato
1
Rubato used to be good. There might have been a change in management, or kitchen staff, but it pretty much tastes horrible, oily and bland. Made for a very very disappointing meal. And my stomach felt terrible after that.The food lacks colour and taste and does not commensurate to the price. For $25-30 per plate, head to the other Italian restaurants down the same aisle for much better quality and taste
2
My most recent visit to Rubato (of 3 in total) was a big let-down in many respects. 1. The service was indifferent: while 3 waiters were on duty, they still repeatedly had to be cajoled into providing service while only 4 tables were occupied. One of several examples: the set lunch menu was not initially offered, but had to be specifically requested. 2. There were a couple of discrepancies between the printed set lunch and the blackboard listing (The Power Lunch) outside, only partly clarified. 3. While the set lunch at $22 seemed appealing, the quality was average and portions were ridiculously small: free bread (a smattering of hard nearly burnt recycled pizza base?); Beef Carpaccio: small thin slice with a sprinkling of rocket minus advertised mixed salad and cherry tomatoes: Braised Veal Cheek; a knob of unexciting meat dumped a top a smallish portion of mashed potatoes with plainish gravy; Tiny wedge of oldish chocolate cake with a small scoop of pink ice cream, in place of the advertised tiramisu; Good coffee which eventually arrived as an afterthought. 4. I would like to say that the 2 friends who ordered a la carte fared better, yet they were equally dissatisfied: Chicken breast (average) with a tiny sample of boiled potatoes, a seafood and tomato dish with mussels, empty shells and rings that barely resembled squid. 5. Final comment: nice setting and environment, but if you are feeling hungry, expecting genuine Italian food or competent service, avoid this place
5
My wife and I were visiting family in Bukit Timah in Singapore at Christmas, and our younger son also arrived on Christmas Eve. Rather than book one of the large expensive hotel/restaurants in town we decided to make a reservation at Rubatos just down the road for lunch on Christmas Day. The restaurant were offering a special menu at S$88, or their very good a la carte menu.So, 6 of us had a very, very good lunch in happy surroundings, with very friendly staff. After thanking the Chef and staff working in the open kitchen we left very well satisfied. We are visiting for a while longer, and so I am certain that we will return for more excellent food at Rubatos
5
The best service EVER , I mean we literally ordered just one dish and still got the best experience . Do ask for person by the name Hari if you want a unique service and feel special
4
Very nice place to have good food, enjoy the food, service and the environment surrounding.
Will be revisit again.
4
Family oriented restaurant. Although they're at the high end of the market at the little strip at Greenwood, it's still visited by a lot of families with kids, which we enjoyed. It makes it lovely. Food is good but quite expensive.
4
Wonderful local Italian eatery - lovely pizza and pasta . Busy greenwood road restaurants - lovely atmosphere especially in the evening .
5
Service and food has improved since we have been there and I'm happy to go back there again
Looking forward
5
Excellent food, great environment. Held an event for 70 pax and had a memorable time. Highly recommended!
4
Ordered a starter soup, pasta and dessert.. All three items were yummy, portion was just nice and worth the price. Will definitely go back for another visit!
5
The staff especially Shem was very accomadating. Unlike some restaurants who push high priced food onto their customers when asked for recommendations, Shem actually understood what we were looking for. Me and my sister ordered one appetizer and one pizza. We tried something new for the appetizer (burrata) as recommended and it was worth it! Also the pizza was one of the best pizza's we ate in Singapore! The food is definately worth the price and don't worry it won't empty your wallet either :) Recommended!!!
5
This place has slowly become our go to place for Italian fare. On our return for lunch, we tried their traditional timeless classic ceasar salad. It was served with a slice of lemon. The bacon was crispy but not dry or burnt. The salad was chilled and had a taste of freshness. There was just sufficient parmesan cheese without overwhelming the freshness of the salad. Well done for making a simple ceasar salad so tasteful and fresh.
5
We have no complains about the meal nor the service. Everything was just perfect. The service was excellent as the staff recommended their Chef's recommendation meal (degustation alike). Everything from the starter right down to the dessert was awesome! They completed our meal with a lime cocktail concoction
4
A very enjoyable evening with a great atmosphere. The food chosen - pizzas and pastas - were substantial if not very exciting. Service was fine and the whole was reasonably priced.
5
Sheila is very welcoming and made the dinning experience even better! The food is very well portion and well served!
4
Stopped but here for a late evening drink and dessert whilst visiting our son. What a lovely place, good atmosphere, friendly service and a tremendous tiramisu. A little expensive perhaps for a restaurant not in the City, but very good and worth a visit nonetheless. Recommended.
5
I was invited by my date to Rubato and I was blown away by the open kitchen concept and the quality of the food served. We ordered prawn bruschetta And oysters for starter, which were amazing . Oysters were powerfully sweet & fresh, while the prawn bruschetta were topped with huge prawns and bread was perfectly toasted crisp. Had Alio olio seafood pasta which has generous serving of quality scallops & prawns, pork ribs were juicy with pepper BBQ sauce , mushroom pizza was the best I ever tasted! Dessert was a must to complete the evening , and it was divine !! The tiramisu & chocolate fondant just teased my appetite .. Was so tempted to order 2 more !! Romantic indoor dining with the company of good food & wine makes me feel so loved! Needless to say , I will definitely come back soon !! Perhaps with another New date

This is our favourite place to get our regular pasta fix. We especially like the 'seafood in the bag' and 'vongole'. We also previously tried their risottos and pizzas and loved them all. It's a wonderful place and we are proud to be regular diners here! Here are some pictures.
5
I had this pasta in a bag they call it, although the mussels were missing from most of the shells the dish was amazing with other seafood. My girlfriend had the hint of spice pizza although not spicy at all I'm going to say out of all the pizza's in Singapore and I have tried probably 30 pizza's atleast this by far was the best. I highly recommend and the people so friendly and I did not see any Italian staff or cooks but truly an Italian experience.
4
The food's of high quality, which explains its prices but I enjoyed every single morsel of it. My starter of Grilled Octopus was so fresh and perfectly paired with its sauce, I was looking forward to more. Our mains of Squid Ink Risotto was full of flavour and the Buffalo Pizza was delicate and exquisite. Service was prompt and very friendly. I would come back with a group of friends next time
4
We went on a Monday night for a girls night out Birthday Dinner. The owner Sheila was very hospitable. All the waiters provided excellent service and were very friendly. Constantly checking in with us to make sure everything is alright. We ordered mushroom soup, one of their signature salad, Burrata cheese pizza and squid ink pasta. And a cake item for the birthday girl. They brought the cake and did a subtle birthday song, which is exactly what we would have preferred. Overall a good choice for casual dining
4
We had a good time at Rubato, tucking into the luscious michelin grade burrata followed by various mains: seafood in a bag, squid ink pasta, etc. I'm not going to elaborate on what we had- suffice it to say that all of it was good and nobody was complaining about anything as each plate was licked clean despite the generous portions!What was small and uninspiring were the desserts- tiramisu was really tiny and the hazelnut ice cream a bit chalky.Overall, we had a great time and left very satisfied
3
We were recommended to have dinner at this restaurant by a local however I wasn't very impressed.
Food was ok but not very memorable. Service was good however didn't make up for the last lustre food.
4
Best pizza we have found in the area.
Friendly staff and great service!
One of our regular dining places
4
Rubato is an excellent restaurant. Not only is the food there good, I also find that the service is great. The waiters are very helpful. I can't wait to go back there again!
5
Try the burrata and the pasta. The clams in white wine sauce is to die for too. It's opened for lunch and dinner and now they have a set lunch menu which is good value for money.
5
First time dining at this restaurant. Set lunch at $19 ++ is quite value for money. Love the quiet ambience & friendly staff especially Sheila! Would come again for sure! Cheers
4
Had the lobster pasta and it was to die for! The lobster was fresh and had a great flavour to it. The service crew was very welcoming and friendly. Would definitely pop by again. Also, I heard that they have a very value for money lunch course going at $19.90. Would probably try that the next time
5
Very friendly restaurant with great food and attentive service ! Burata and grilled squid were perfect appetizers....main courses came promptly despite a full house. Our server Ari was a star ! Attentive and served with so much pride and grateful smile ! Will be back soon for sure.
5
Rubato's service was simply amazing as their staff were very sensitive to our needs but were not intrusive in any way. They also made an effort to listen to our preferences so they could offer recommendations that suited perfectly to our taste buds. My friend and I each had a full bodied red wine and shared the traditional Neapolitan pizza. The pizza was a killer, the flavours were in perfect harmony and not one taste was overpowering another. The red wine pairing we had just lifted the pizza flavour and I couldn't stop myself from having more. Overall, it was one of the most delightful meals I had in a long time and I highly recommend Rubato
5
It was a very pleasant experience visiting Rubato as we were looking for a place to have dinner on a Sunday night. Ambience and service was excellent and the pizzas we ordered were authentically Italian. It was also nice having Sheila share a little bit about the restaurant as we were on our way out! Worth a second visit! -Jennife
5
The food as well as the service is very good. The price is a bit on the high side though, might be due to the neighbourhood.All in all a restaurant that I visit frequently and I recommend to everybody who likes good italian food in a quiet neighbourhood off the busy city
5
Great food, we finished 4 mains among 3 people
Long Island Tea was appropriately potent.
Friendly, down-to-earth and sincere service
5
Starter...of grilled squid was excellent as were the tiger prawn main, but the lava cake for dessert was the best!! Ambience was nice and easy and will for sure be back again!!
5
Here's my Favorite place. I come here every time when I visit Singapore. I'm impressed their warm welcome and excellent service. Especially, Sheila's always take care of all customer with beautiful smile.  Extremely commendable selection of food cooked to its authenticity. And really Unforgettable. Highly recommended !
5
Brilliant service, superb food, excellent locaion. We have enjoyed the food and atmosphere at RUBATO many times and keep going back. Today, the chef offered us a special dish that wasn't advertised: roasted brie, encrusted with pistachio nuts, served with pomelo salsa and cold cuts. It made us feel very special and indulged. Other dishes we have enjoyed on past visits were The Extra Skinny Cow (beef carpaccio) and grilled baby octopus salad. It's a particularly great place to while away the early afternoon on a sunny Sunday.
5
Rubato, my best Authentic Italian restaurant visit after back from 3 Nation Charity Ride 2016 Cha Am , Hua Hin I enjoyed the Cabonara i ordered is superb with delicious cream & melting cheese so well doneTasty soft bread dip with olives oil with black vinegar so appetising Restaurant setting is nice for a cosy meal while enjoying the greeneryFriendly Staff & food is serve on timeThanks Marcus for the good job
4
It was my first time to dine at Rubato. Our reservation was for 7 PM but one party was sightly delayed, so we started with a German Weissbier at the bar. Once at the table I ordered the grilled octopus and the osso bucco followed by panacotta. All three dishes were prepared very well with the occo bucco standing out.Overall, Rubato is a solid Italian neighbourhood restaurant which I recommend for outings with family and friends
5
Love Italian food? Rubato is the place for you!! The staff are very kind and are willing to serve you with care no matter how busy they get. Loyal customers are very privileged, they get free coupons and sometimes complimentary food! The food is just amazing. They have many unique dishes like Seafood in A Bag and Squid Ink Pasta. If you are lonely and have no one to talk to, the staff will not hesitate to go up to you and keep you entertained. The prices are very reasonable and sometimes there are discounts just for you! They also host parties. A friend of mine celebrated her birthday party there and the staff had decorated the whole place with flowers! There is a glass window where you can look through and see the chef cooking! Rubato is a place that you just have to visit
5
I enjoyed the food; the service is great; the Seafood in a Bag is absolutely delicious. I would recommend very strongly that lovers of Italian food try this place at least once. I find that Italian food in Singapore in restaurants like this tend to be of a high and competitive standard. Rubato may not be the best among the many Italian restaurants in this magnificent city state, but definitely stands shoulder to shoulder with some of the best of them. I would especially recommend the Burrata and the Seafood in a Bag. I really liked that the staff are so personable and able to customise their recommendations to their customers' taste. Special thanks to Sheila, Marcus, and Shem for their warmth and hospitality
5
My husband was apprehensive to go Rubato because of negative reviews he read. I am glad I managed to persuade him and we had the Best Italian we ever eaten !! That's why I felt the need to write this review , usually I don't , and share our discovery . My children loved the pasta - carbonara & aglio olio , cooked with flavour & al denteMy hubby cleaned up the T-bone , done perfectly to his request I had the suckling pig which was crispy and tender, something special which I would never order in an Italian restaurant , but turned out to be a yummy surprise We managed to find space in our tummies for desserts which were outstanding - Tiramisu & chocolate fondant Looking forward to our next visit to try more other dishes !

Rubato is one of the few restaurants in my experience that has maintained its standard over the years -- sadly, many of my once-favourite restaurants seem to dip in standard somewhat as time passes. Not so for Rubato. The dish that first caught my attention -- the "Seafood in a Bag" -- is consistently flavourful and appetising. I'm sure being wrapped in parchment paper is not the sole reason for the intensity of its flavour -- the quality of the ingredients is really what makes it the go-to dish for many customers. Their pastas are, in general, of high standard. I have not tried much of their meats -- difficult to resist their pastas -- and will probably do so next round. There is a good range of appetisers, and what I have tried is impressive. Their grilled squid is well balanced -- just enough of a smoked taste without being overpowering. The Burrata, which I tried for the first time last Saturday, was incredibly creamy, complex, and a joy to eat. Equally astonishing were the tomatoes they were served with -- not only the characteristically crisp and sweet Sicilian cherry tomatoes, but these ridiculously delicious cured tomatoes that they prepare at the restaurant. I am told that the recipe is secret, but I'd guess that thyme, basil, and probably rosemary, some sugar, and good EV olive oil go into its seasoning. There is just the slightest resistance against the teeth -- like semi-dried tomatoes, but bursting more readily -- and the full flavour of vine-ripened tomatoes, packed to concentrated levels. It is dangerously addictive. Wine was especially good -- ask for the Morellino if you have no particular preference of your own. It is like a Chianti, but less tannic, with a full, fruity bouquet, and a lingering finish. And, of course, what makes a good dining experience is not only the quality of food but the quality of service -- Rubato shines in this aspect. Shem, Marcus, and Sheila are genuine, warm, and dedicated to creating a wonderful dining experience for their customers. In short: definitely a place to dine at if you want a reliably good meal prepared and served by people who take pride in what they do
5
Awesome food, superb service.. Must try their lobster pasta, seafood risotto and wagyu flank..Sure will be back!! Thanks for the hospitality Rubato.
5
Had the squid ink risotto that was so tasty! Awesome atmosphere and service staff that made a family dinner perfect!
4
Rubato is one of my family's favourite restaurants in Singapore for Italian food. Be it a casual family meal or even dinner on a special occasion, Rubato fits the bill.Our must-order on every visit is their Michelin-quality burrata, which never fails to impress. Other favourites include their Prime rib/T-bone and their pastas.Service is warm, which is a great complement to the good food and atmosphere.Another plus is that the restaurant provides complimentary valet service since parking is limited in the area
5
Shem, our waiter, found out that it was our first time and that the restaurant was highly recommended by our friend who had celebrated his birthday there last week. Shem remembered my friend's celebration & then suggested that we have the same tasting menu which came a dish my friend had recommended, angel hair pasta with scallops. All the dishes were delicious and everyone at the restaurant was friendly and attentive. Will definitely go back
4
This place has been my regular hang out for some time now. At least 95% of the time they don't disappoint me. Why 95% only? This is because a couple of times their food do disappoint. And given that I have tried some menu many times I would notice the difference, both in presentation and in flavor. We just guess sometimes it's different chef who did it. Nevertheless, Rubato is a nice place to hang out, with excellent food, excellent Italian wine selection, and friendly service. Recommended pasta menu are cold angel hair pasta with scallop and truffle oil, Hokkaido scallop pasta, and squid ink pasta, among other things. Pork ribs are nice and juicy. Big portion so it's better to be shared by 2 people. Mushroom pizza with truffle is usually very nice. Our little boy told the chef that this is the best pizza in the world :). For appetizers, if you are tired with the usual Italian fare, go for the grilled squid, or the salad with burrata cheese. When you are not sure which menu to order, they can also prepare degustation menu for you. It's not written anywhere in the menu, but you can ask for it. Net, this place is recommended. Will definitely come back
5
Have been to Rubato a few times. Enjoyed very much the lobster noodles-noodles was al dente, just right, and the lobster nicely charred and fragrant. We also had the tenderloin medium well- turned out just that, and not overdone. Service was attentive, prompt and friendly.This will remain a favoruite place for a relaxing evening out wit family and friends
5
I read many wonderful reviews before planning a trip to Rubato, so glad I did. Rubato has outstanding staff who provide quality service and food to their customers. Keep it up!I love (x3) the squid ink risotto, honestly one of the best I had in years! Alas, an Italian restaurant that serves excellent Italian food in Singapore! Thank you Sheila and Fred (I hope I got your name right!)! You made our night! We can't wait to try the degustation menu! See you all soon! -Yoland
5
Celebrating a friend's birthday so we decided to bring him to Rubato. We had been to their old branch several times before and they had won over us with the great service and excellent food. This was rhe first time we were going to their current restaurant. Gladly, service and food quality levels had not dropped, a thoroughly enjoyable experience
5
First impression when u dine at fine dining restaurant so we should expect to be solemn ambience, great food and excellent service w/ the smiley face of the waiter/waitress. Yes, indeed they meet the standard. MUST TRY "Angel Hair aglio olio with diver-caught, fresh Hokkaido scallops" well, when the waiter served it in my table i really sense the pasta was cooked tasty because of the smell.. just like hypnotizing someone! The taste so great really meet my taste buds especially the ingredient basil who made the pasta more delicious and the angel hair spaghetti was cooked al dente. Secondly, the dessert "Traditional Italian Carrot Cake with home-made vanilla gelato" every bite of the cake was perfectly taste amazing w/shredded carrots. On the other hand, I can recognized that it is freshly baked because of the dense texture and the moist. What about Gelato? a perfect match while eating the cake with vanilla gelato. Sounds great right
5
My friends and I ordered the tasting menu.. which I highly recommend. Service was excellent too as I told the waiter that it was my friend's birthday and they presented him with a dessert tasting platter and sang him a birthday song! Will definitely visit again
4
Nice place with good food and friendly staff…
Is a ideal place for couples, family gathering or private events with nice ambience
5
Was here with my hubby, Sheila served us and recommended us to the angel hair pasta with scallops which was very special and delicious. The pork rack was very juicy and tiramisu is definitely a must try. Will be back again! - Yvette
5
Had a group for a Saturday Night dinner!Went with little expectation but was impressed by the food.European style Suckling pig with super crisp skin and moist was the best i have had.Ensemble of different Risotto's was well reviewed by party and I especially like the mushroom risotto with truffles.Burrata antipasto was as good as I've had in ItalyFinally the Yuzu Gelato was a refreshing end.Slightly on the pricey end but I do feel it was good value for the quality
4
We came here for dinner. The selection of food looked fantastic and we had a hard time making choices. Shem made a few recommendations that turned out to be great for us. Sheila came by to see how we were doing and we ended up having a great conversation with her. She has such a warm and joyful personality that made us felt at home. She is such a blessing to the restaurant. Thank you Sheila
5
We come here regular as we enjoy the ambience sitting outside, haven get food. Our kids always enjoy the pizza, I enjoy the bavarian beer.It´s easy to come by car as they offer complimentary car parking so we don´t need to worry abut parking.Sheila is a very kind person ti help us with any wish. that´s why we will come again
5
Beautiful atmosphere straight from the get-go, with a nice chill vibe and jazz music playing in the background. The food is excellent. I would highly recommend the Angel Hair Pasta with Hokkaido Scallops. It is something different, but very tasty and unique.The service is great too. Friendly and approachable. It is Sheila, one of the waiters there who recommended the Angel Hair Pasta dish.Overall a great experience
5
Was here for dinner. From the time we were seated till we left, was utterly impressed. The team gave good recommendations, was proactive and attentive.Have to recommend their scallops and angel hair past and their lobster linguini.Ambience is great, very suitable for gatherings or all sizes.Overall Good food / great service. Outstanding
5
Really good food. We tried the carbonara and the squid ink pasta and both were really nice. Would highly recommend the grilled squid, which is simple yet flavoursome. Pizzas are great, really. Service was really good as everyone was very sociable. Sheila was really nice and she chatted with us too. Ambience is great, very suitable for small or large gatherings. On a whole, this place was great
5
Had the grilled squid and cold angel hair pasta with Japanese scallops for starters. Both were well done! These were followed by the iberican pork rack which again was amazing. Ended off with tiramisu dessert, which according to my sweets-loving wife, was one of the best she has tried. Look for Sheila to sort out your dining experience
5
Great food and great service! Shem served us the last time we came and today as well! Attentive and recommends well. Even gives us extras as we come pretty often! Our usual starters are the burrata, the beef carpaccio and the mussels in white wine. Pizza wise our usual is the Parma ham with arugula and egg and the cold angel hairPasta is amazing! For mains, we had the pork ribs which was yummy and we love the lamb!Love the food and will be back again and again
5
This place never lets me down. The prawns are fresh and succulent. We tried their new item cold crawfish and it was superb, great value for money.
Sheila never fails to leave me laughing and happy.
You can be sure we will be back!
5
Ambience was lovely
Service staff was friendly and attentive
I ordered the lobster bisque which was heartwarming
Grilled medley of grilled vegetables called the ' under the Tuscan sun' was perfectly grilled
Pizza was crisp and perfect
Best I ever eaten

It was a very happy time here spending with my friends. I was really intrigued by the quality food. Moreover, the service is really beyond expectation.
5
food is great, lots of different choices from pastas to pizzaz and everything. cool air inside and sometimes outside. Service is nice and fast.
5
The staff is very amicable and attentive. Sheila served us with warmth and passion. The t-bone and pork belly we had is superb. A superb dinning experience !
4
Went there for our anniversary and the service was good as usual. Friendly staff but some items a little overpriced. However food is tasty. Watch out for the specials. Make sure you know the price before ordering. I got a shock once with the bill of the special that was recommended to me
4
My husband & I chose this restaurant based on a recommendation from our realtor. It is located in a quiet neighborhood of Greenwood. It is nice to see a restaurant of this nature with good food in a small neighborhood.Our realtor was absolutely accurate in his recommendation. The food was very well prepared and delicious. I ordered Spaghetti Vongole.....perfectly cooked pasta and clams with a very tasty wine/butter broth. My husband ordered Seafood in a Bag......pasta & seafood were cooked well. The price of a meal was very reasonable.The owner, Sheila was very welcoming and friendly. She greeted us and made us feel comfortable. The service was attentive and efficient. I will be returning to this establishment in the future. Thank you Sheila for a pleasant dining experience.Expat teacher & husban
5
I love my pasta, and I say that the pasta I had at Rubato was excellent, the texture is cooked just right. We have also ordered the grilled squid, ribs, and pizza which was also yummy. Service was great, the owners also chatted with us to make sure everything was alright. Definitely returning to try their other dishes
5
We wanted somewhere for a lazy Sunday lunch and Rubato did not disappoint. Sitting on the outdoor terrace, a nice breeze, a cold beer or two, yummy scallops to start and delicious pork ribs and a pineapple pizza for mains. A great wine list and lovely service from Shem and Daniel, thank you guys (also for the water bowls for our pooches). We will come again!
4
Love the appetiser - cold angel hair pasta with Hokkaido scallops.
Desserts were fabulous.
Minus point - Location is not very convenient
5
nice and delicious pasta! service has improved since my previous visit.
good for a quick dinner out and for good Italian food
4
Nice food with very good service.. will go back again.. Sham and Sheila provided very nice and comfortable environment for me and family.. price was very reasonable..
5
Awesome place to dine in with , serving modern Italian food.Look out for special created by Chef & Starter is definitely a must try station.
5
I was invited by my date to Rubato and I was blown away by the open kitchen concept and the quality of the food served. We ordered prawn bruschetta And oysters for starter, which were amazing . Oysters were powerfully sweet & fresh, while the prawn bruschetta were topped with huge prawns and bread was perfectly toasted crisp. Had Alio olio seafood pasta which has generous serving of quality scallops & prawns, pork ribs were juicy with pepper BBQ sauce , mushroom pizza was the best I ever tasted! Dessert was a must to complete the evening , and it was divine !! The tiramisu & chocolate fondant just teased my appetite .. Was so tempted to order 2 more !! Romantic indoor dining with the company of good food & wine makes me feel so loved! Needless to say , I will definitely come back soon !! Perhaps with another New date
5
I was at Rubatos tonight with my wife and daughter and was delighted to feel well served with the personal attention and touch from the waiters.We ordered the Burrata and Angel Hair pasta as starters. The Burrata is fresh and milky soft whilst the musky heavy truffles over the fine light Angel Hair pasta was a hit with my wife. I was surprised my daughter, who is approaching 2 years old, liked the pasta too. For mains, Kobe Wagyu beef cooked to medium was one of the best. Wifey enjoy pan fried snapper. Good job to Marcus and the Rubato team
5
Food was great. Back again for the 4th time to celebrate my sister's birthday. They even prepared a slice of cake for us! I love their grilled octopus, carbonara as well as their special of the day, squid ink pasta with grilled lobster. That was really fresh and delicious. Lovely service. Look for Sheila!
4
Came here with my Daughter and Son during the weekends. Greeted by a friendly manageress called Shella. She was so passionate about food and what Rubato has to offer. We ordered Murata cheese with Parma ham - average, mussels with white wine - excellent! The oyster was great and fresh. The lamb rack was juicy and delicious so is the " seafood in a bag ". Even the chocolate lava cake was nice and sweet, comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Overall, the dinner was great, good service and not too hot. Will come back in future if there is a chance. There is also a private room for 14 people. The experience is very good and suitable for children and adults. Good Italian food
5
Coming back here is like coming back home! The warmth of their service is like none other! Singapore recently had their Michelin Guide introduced and Rubato should seriously be part of it. I have no doubt that their dedication to quality of food and service would earn them a star in the very near future. Please please look out for Hari! He is the man when it comes to service
5
We've been to Rubato since it's opening and it is the place for excellent and reliable service and consistently tasting good food. The boss is so friendly, the staff, especially Hari, are so friendly, the food is AMAZING! We always have such a blast going there!
4
Wonderful food and service from the staff of Rubato. Efficient, attentive and friendly - Especially Ms Shelia. Great recommendation... If you ever get the chance to visit this place.. Do look for her and check out their speciality: Spanish suckling pig! Will definitely be back!
5
We were served by Sheila lovely and full of passion on here job .
We had pork ribs and spinach ravioli with excellent tapped lager pint.
5
We've gone here a few times and the food is consistently good, from the appetizers such as the burata and salads to the pasta mains (squid ink being my fave) and meat dishes.
4
One of the best pastas I've ever had!!! Seafood was very fresh and the seafood soup was robust :) Would definitely visit again for special occasions! Thank you Sheila for serving us
5
Very warm ambiance. Professional service. High quality of food. Nice location. We had great time, and we felt very welcome.
5
This was the second time I've been here and Rubato never fails to pleasantly surprise us! Shem was really friendly and attentive.
The tiramisu dessert with a touch of crunchy pistachio was just so on point. A must try. Rubato's pasta are really good too.
5
I've been coming to Rubato on and off for about 3 years and I remain impressed with the standards of their food and quality of the service. The burrata is a must-have, and the quality of their mains is incredible. I especially liked their scallop pasta with truffle cream, while my date was actually lost for words at the snapper. We will definitely come back here soon! Our thanks to Sheila in particular, who came around often to personally inquire if we were satisfied, a practice I feel has been lost among restaurant owners nowadays
5
I was there with my boyfriend and we had such a great dinner! We absolutely loved the burrata, and the T-bone was grilled to perfection. Very, very reasonable prices for such good Italian wines too. Service staff were very friendly and eager to ensure we have an amazing time. One of the few places in Singapore with a nice alfresco dining. We will definitely be back
4
dinner for 2 at rubato this evening. attentive service even though we were seated at an outside corner. burrata was fantastic, good portions of each ingredient which blended together beautifully. had grilled lamb rack and spaghetti aglio olio for mains. the lamb was a tad too expensive for the small portion, though the meat and outercrust were very well done. the aglio olio was very oily but one of the tastier ones i've had so far. all in all a good meal
5
Really enjoyed the evening in this lovely restaurant. My favorite is the Cold Angel Hair Pasta with Hokkaido scallops, it's really a "gift from the angels". Must try dishes :1) Burrata2) Slow Braised spanish octopus3) Australian Mussels4) Lobster Bisque5) Squid ink rissotta6) Tiramisu (best i've tried
5
Really enjoyed delicious food and attentive service. Thank you so much to Sheila and the team, especially the chef! We really loved the 'Black footed pig' and scallop pasta. One of the best restaurants we've visited in Singapore! Will definitely come back. Thank you!
5
Excellent food and service. Tried their scallop & Parma. Good texture and value for money. Wagyu beef done to perfection. Chocolate molten cake not very sweet but very savoury. To die for.
Definitely coming back with friends and family again.
4
We live 50 meters from this place, love the atmosphere and the friendly staff, it is my kitchen away from home. My favorite thing about the place is the open kitchen and the very approachable list of Italian wines. A Must try!
5
Great gastronomic experience.
The waiter was very friendly and service was great!
The cold angel hair appetiser and lobster bisque are worth trying.
5
Our umpteenth time at Rubarto and it never fails to disappoint 👍👍
Shem and his colleagues made us feel right at home 😘😘
5
Each time I come here for a meal, I go away really impressed with the Quality of the food and service. Marcus the chef and owner has done a great job in putting this place together. Love it!
5
We have never been disappointed. From the amazing food to the excellent service, Rubatos is our go to for Italian food in Singapore. A very warm atmosphere with authentic Italian cuisine. Thank you Marcus and team for always taking care of us.
5
Tucked away in a little group of shops off bukit timah road, this restaurant is well worth finding. Great Italian food, best pizza I've had in Singapore, and excellent mains. Very reasonable prices, wines starting at $11 a glass and bottles $50. Excellent value for high quality food. Staff are friendly and attentive. Fantastic restaurant. A new favorite.
5
I travelled around the world and excited to taste world-class Italian food tucked in a wealthy neighborhood of Singapore. Throughout my week stay in Singapore, this is the best meal I ever had ..The cold Angel's hair with Hokkaido scallops & Japanese Seaweed was mouthwatering & delicious, the perfect accompany for Singapore's weather The signature Parma Ham with BURRATA was even better than the one I had in Italy. Oysters was fresh and affordable at $6, air-flown from USA Mushroom Risotto was amazing soft and flavorful , lobster with pasta was another favourite The party dessert for sharing was devilish salivating - chocolate lava/fondant, tiramisu , gelato . I felt so lucky eating the beautiful gold dust that was sprinkled over the plate .. If u like Italian, you won't regret coming to Rubato!!!
5
Thank you to the team at Rubato for an excellent evening! I had organised a family makan session (12 pax) at Rubato as I wanted to share my new find of a great Italian restaurant! Btw the family loved it if you can't tell by the smiles on their faces!!We had arranged for a set dinner menu (basically told them my budget) and had awesome variety from burratta, their signature angel hair pasta, grilled squid, mussels, wagyu, lobster and desserts; and they all taste so good!!! It's really value for money when you consider the taste and quality of food as well as the ambience and location of the restaurant. I can't wait for my next fix... Maybe I'll go for the clam pasta
5
If you are looking for a real Italian hospitality great food perfect service then it's the place to be in Singapore.
A little out of the centre of town but it is worth the 20 minutes drive.
2
Been to Rubatos several times before but Sat night's dinner service was so bad I don't think I am going back again.We were ushered to our reserved table right in front and the exuberant male greeter informed us about the weekend specials. After ordering, we had to ask repeatedly for water, sharing plates (we told at least 4 staff we planned to share dishes), utensils to eat with and for serving each time.There was a long wait from soups and appetisers to the mains, which we wanted to cancel. Staff assiduously avoided eye contact, waving hands and the exuberant greeter continued ushering in new customers but thereafter ignored beckoning seated customers.Food was decent and the restaurant gave us a complimentary platter of desserts to their credit but the experience was certainly sour
4
Discovered a great place for Italian food. Open kitchen concept where you get to see the chefs at work. We had pasta today. I tried the cold angel hair pasta with Hokkaido scallops and truffle oil. Very interesting. Never had cold pasta with truffle oil. Would recommend it. If you are a big eater, the portion might not be sufficient.
1
I never write negative comments, in fact this is the first time andI waited 2 month to write this review.I've been there twice and second time was really the "winner" after a poor first try with my kids.I will be short and strait to the point, it was during lunch time, and restaurant 3/4 empty:The waiter did his very best to conceal the set lunch from us to push us to take a la carte and was only interested into increasing the bill (prices are steep)After a long wait, one of the plate we received was not properly cleaned from the previous customer: a huge dried tomato paste smudged on a 1/3 of the plate in a cream pasta plate... Nor the cook or the waiter cared they just served. We sent it back.This is the beauty with open kitchen (by the way it is dirty!), we saw the cook just taking the pasta and putting it into another plate! Are you for real? Of course no apologies.I like open kitchen concept, but it can really slap you back in the faceSorry guys but really dreadfu

This was my second time here and I'd recommend if you want a nice Italian cuisines and atmosphere and you don't mind the price. It's tough to get a parking around this area and I find that it is always easier to come here with a cab. You can always call a cab after your lovely dinner and you had a couple of wine. The last time visit cost about average SGD 100+ per person. But I would still say it's worth it. I visited with some of my family and we tasted quite a few dishes there. All the food here are always yummy so whenever we visited, we shared our dishes with others. In this way, we are always able to taste a variety of dishes. One thing I like about their food is that they always have the special dishes outside of the regular menu. And we actually ordered all three special dishes this time, I ordered a oyster pasta dishes. We had rabbit and pasta, lamb chops, beef steak, several salad dishes, two of their pizzas. I love their pizza. It's a thin crust and I love the fact that I can smell a little of smoky in my pizza. Didn't mean it in a bad way but for me, this smell means it's fresh out of the oven and baked with care. My oyster pasta today's special dish was great. I love the sauce. It has the right flavour for the oysters. Not too creamy with great seasonings. The pasta cooked nice with a great texture. The rabbit special that I had a few spoonful was also delicious. The shredded meat juicy and melted in your mouth. The flavour very rich and the seasoning compliment the gamey meat. the seasonings didn't overtake the rabbit but actually take care of the stronger and wilder taste that I usually recognize and never enjoy in game meat. I would have ordered another of this dish for myself if I have enough space in my stomach that evening.We also had Carbonara from the regular menu. I find this dish not too overly creamy like most of the Carbonara I tasted. Again, the pasta cooked perfectly. Though I didn't have a chance to taste their Beef Steak dish, (the accompanied vegetable was asparagus, which I am extremely allergic to) I could feel that it was a great dish by the way, how my family polished it quickly.The lamb dish was a fine dish with sautÃ©ed baby carrots, Brussels sprouts (my fave!) and tangy flavour sauce. The meat cooked perfectly. It was soft and flavourful. The tangy sauce compliment the meat very well and I found myself scraping the sauce from the plates with the carrots at the end. They do have a nice selection of wine. Their staff would easily able to recommend you a good selection to go with your dining. The service is one of the top that I would see in Singapore. They are very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere, though it's casual you can taste the sophistication in the air. The Indoor would be good for different occasion both family and slightly casual business dining. The setting is not too formal to intimidate your clients yet the casualness you find in this establishment screams unique. Perhaps, a good place to impress your clients in a more relax environment. I'd say it's good for special occasions too. Like for example, a mother's day with the family or anniversary dinner. Or just a birthday dining with family and close friends.

I have been here twice and enjoyed both experiences so far. The ossobucco is my favourite dish there and the pastas are very reasonably priced as well. Parking can be quite an issue though. Although I was already very happy with the flavourful food, the next time I would ask for the food to be slightly less salted

We had the special degustation dinner for Restaurant Week, which features several Rubato signature dishes eg Hokkaido scallops, burrata, wagyu flank steak, oyster pasta and tiramisu. The portions were a bit on the small side, but adequate, and still good value at $38++ per person. Flavour wise, the dishes were all very good. The complimentary bread was tasty, and the olive oil fresh and fruity. The pasta and potato mash that accompanied the scallops and beef respectively were infused with heavenly truffle oil aroma. Service was friendly, but the restaurant was quite noisy inside during the first half of our dinner because it was full house, so it was hard to have a conversation. We had a good Brunello and Barolo which washed everything down quite well. All in, it was a very good dinner, and Rubato will certainly be high on our list the next time we want to eat Italian

Been here twice with my family for lunch as it is located in a quiet but hip neighbourhood close to my daughter's school. The first time, my daughter and I had their burrata cheese with cherry tomatoes and Parma ham, and a cold angel hair pasta with Hokkaido scallops in truffle oil. Both are their signature dishes. Today, we took the creamy mushroom soup, lobster bisque, roast Iberico pork and grilled squid. I must say that both times, we enjoyed the food very much. The burrata is fresh and tastes heavenly and the slightly sweetish-acidic tomatoes and mildly salty Parma ham blends well with the cheese. Angel-hair pasta was good, reminded me of the signature cold angel-hair with Oscieta caviar from Gunther's. Rubato's came a close second to Gunther's. Lobster bisque was good, none of those ground lobster shells in the bisque, but would have been better if there were some bits of lobster meat.Price is quite expensive though. The first meal was well over $150 for a burrata ($48) and 2 small plates of angel-hair including taxes and still water. The second meal was even more.Service was prompt although it could be better. I had wanted the soup first and the grilled squid (normally a starter) to come as main, but both dishes were served together. Furthermore, instead of clearing away the used cutlery, the waitress took out the spoon I had used for the soup and put it on the table to be reused for the next dish! That would be fine in a casual cafe, but this place seem to be more upmarket than that! The aircon also did not seem to be working well today, I was really perspiring profusely as I started on the soup and couldn't wait to finish my meal and leave to a cooler place. Lunch was a noisy affair too as there were many diners talking loudly.Parking in Greenwood area during mealtimes is always a headache as there are limited lots available. Valet service is usually available during dinner, I don't see them around during lunch and had to search a bit to get a parking lot.So overall, if you are there for the food and don't mind the parking issues, the rather pricey dishes and ok service, it would be a good place to go

Some things are only skin deep. Cool restaurants can appear to offer the swagger but don't meet the reality of a great dinning experience. Let's face it we pay them to eat their food. Let's break it down , Thursday night and $92.00 for some rather tasty linguine and spaghetti, 1 glass of red wine and a salad. Not bad. Staff very friendly and accommodating at the start of meal, but where it counts they drop the ball. An hour wait between salad and pasta while everyone else gets served. I was famished too. Was it acknowledged? NoDid I have to flag a waiter? Yes Did he listen to my question? No Did anyone apologize? NoCheque Please!!!!!Still nothing, not even a good bye and the place was half empty.I'm sure the chef is brilliant but honestly in this block there are 2 other Italian options and they do it better.Such a shame and it looks so cool.

was there for lunch during Chinese new year. highlight of the day for me was the 1kg of roasted wagyu flank on a bed of roast veggies. not cheap at $190 but it was steak done medium and tender to bite. the roast chicken is also good
5
We ate unplanned lunch around 16 pm, The stuff treat you very nice. Delicious dishes, fresh and tasty. The atmosphere outside at the porch was just wonderful . We will come again.
4
Food is fresh and good , however , serving portion is small , so i would recommend you having appetisers before main course. Excellent service though
4
What attracted my wife and I to this restaurant was the ambience. It looked trendy without being flashy. It was cozy and the perfect place for a date. The food however is average.
4
It was a great location for good food with family. Wild boar was really tasty, chicken was a little small but seasoning was equisite. Pizza was excellent. Pasta with cream sauce was a little plain but for picky dinners I am guessing its a good choice.Desserts were just right to end the meal baked to perfection was the hazelnut tart with Mango sorbet ...so very yummy
4
We have been many times and the food is usually very good. The Burrata, in particular, is the best you can get in Singapore. Unfortunately the Wait Staff tend to try to get you to buy the most expensive dishes, which is silly, and are too attentive over pouring out the wine but are otherwise fine. But these are the reasons they only rank 3*. When there is White Truffle season they have superb white truffle spaghetti to die for, because they shave it in front of you and you always want a lot, so you need a mortgage if you are not careful. However it is the most sublime I have ever had and for a one off, it is definitely worth it. Recommended especially for lunch when it is not busy

We had dinner in Rubato earlier this evening, and it turned out to be one of the best we ever had. We were half an hour earlier for our 6.30pm dinner reservation, but we were promptly seated at our table. We ordered a variety of dishes: 4 fresh oysters, a plate of scallop pasta, a plate of maine lobster pasta, and a medium wagyu beef. These were all from the menu that was separated from the main menu itself, and I must say the food quality was excellent.Oysters were fresh. The scallop pasta (this is a cold dish with a small serving; it probably is an appetizer) was served with a generous amount of truffle oil and olives with really fresh scallops. The medium wagyu beef was done just perfect to our tastebuds and the maine lobster pasta was wonderful. However, the lobster was a little on the salty side though. We also ordered a bottle of red wine, of which, we were subsequently recommended to try another bottle instead and we gladly obliged. The recommended wine turned out surprisingly good.Desserts was Mango Macademia and Tiramisu. Both were really good and I'm sure the other desserts would be perfect as well.The Italian waiter (I assume he is the boss there) was very attentive to our needs. The moment I lifted my wine bottle to refill our glasses, he rushed over apologizing that he was attending to some other matters, before taking the bottle from me and helping me fill up our glasses.Toilets were a little cramp, but I guess there is not much of a choice given that the restaurant is situated in a shophouse kind of setting.In general, excellent restaurant. Grazie mille

We had a family dinner there last night and it was an incredibly pleasant one as the serving staff were all over us and wanting to help to make our experience a good one. They volunteered to request fresh croissants from next door for the kids and that worked a treat with the little ones. On the whole, the food and the wine was good and we felt very attended to, but perhaps my one piece of feedback would be to chill out a little. The attentiveness was fantastic but also made me feel a little rushed or 'kan cheong' to finish up quickly :) I'd definitely go back again
1
Staff tried to hard-sell items that were more expensive than the two items we were already buying. The ham on the Hawaiian pizza was sour and had probably gone off. The pizza crust tasted more like a thin and dry version of naan bread. When I used the wash-room, there was baby diarrhoea streaked all over the wall from the mirror to the door handle
2
We went for dinner and my friend actually had a huge cockroach land on him and run all over before I screamed and killed it. And what does the manager have to say is a shrug and sorry!!! Seriously as a food establishment I would worry about eating in this restaurant. And to boot service sucks. They did not tell us the kitchen was closing and so we couldn't order dessert. Not going bac

We showed up 30 minutes early for our 8:00 pm reservation on a Friday night. They showed us to our table, which had 3 chairs instead of 4, and the table wasn't set. Granted we were early but it would have taken 60 seconds to set the table properly.It took a while to get chairs and place setting for 4. Finally we did, and placed our orders. The food was amazing as always - great burrata, seafood in a bag so good, mushroom risotto divine, and lovely wine. But the service was just okay - we had to ask multiple times for fresh plates, silverware, and even serving utensils.I really love this restaurant but a little more attention to detail would go a long way
4
The food was great. I can't really say that there was anything that we did not like. However, I didn't like the upselling tactics the waiters used. They constantly tried to get us to order more expensive stuff. Watch out for this!
2
The upselling began the minute we sat down and didn't stop till the end of the evening. Despite the good food, it is unlikely I will return as the incessant up selling left a bad taste in the mouth for us.
4
Tried their pasta and pizza on a night out with friends. Food is delicious and not too expensive given the location. Staff look after us very well.
3
We had a really 'average' experience while dining there twice in one month, and it was consistently average. We waited forever for drinks and food and the bill, and both times we got served with a bit of an attitude (and not by the usual wait staff but what seemed the more senior managers). maybe it was just bad luck for us. On the bright side, the ceasar salad was good and the portions were pretty generous. It feels and looks like it could be so much more
3
when i go to a restaurant with my family, i want to be able to talk to my family. the problem with this restaurant is that the staff are too engaging ... i'm a social dude, don't get me wrong, but i don't quite like being interrupted every few minutes to be asked how the food is or to have my wine topped up every other sip (which is irritating and not what a wait staff from any restaurant should do).food's decent ... not too expensive, not too cheap, not quite mid-range. i would eat there again ... but i hope the next time it's not so intrusive.it's a shame really because i like the restaurant
4
This casual Italian joint has a relaxed, laid back vibe to it. You'll immediately feel at home, especially in the outdoor seating area which is a wonderful place to spend sunny weekend lunches.The new specials menu is hit and miss. Steer clear of the Truffle Angel Hair pasta which promised cold pasta drenched in truffle purÃ©e and caviar for $48 but turned out insipid, overly wet, and hardly worth half the price. It was the utter let down of the day.The "wagyu cut" steak thankfully saved the day. It was succulent, done perfectly medium rare, and accompanied with perfectly poached pears, a rich wine sauce with bacon bits, fried mozzarella sticks and fingerling potatoes.The Caesar salad is also a reliable starter. The super sized croutons are lovely amidst a perfectly salted anchovy sauce.Service is very welcoming and gracious. Make sure you listen to their recommendations. They're overly honest to a fault and are eager to make your day

Food is good but it seems to have some sort of identity problem as am confused if it is meant to be a more fine dining or just a simple nice looking italian set-up. Food was good but nothing that i would classify as modern/outstanding. Squid Ink pasta was a bit overloaded with squid ink sauce while the pizza did actually taste good. Noticed the very same terrible mistake of forced upselling as reported by other. Management should really stop this immediately as it was embarassing to say the least. Got to the point of the guy taking a piece of paper of his pocket to read what he was trying to propose/sell
4
I've been to Rubato many times. Service is very good (better if you sit inside). The wine is all Italian, which unfortunately I am not that familiar with, but the owner will explain and help you choose and the prices are great. The food is very tasty. Highly recommend asking them to make up an antipasto platter for all to share and I love the black risotto.

Went for Sunday lunch with family. It's a casual restaurant with open kitchen and both indoor and outdoor seating. They offer a Sunday brunch and a la Carte menu with limited selection. Their burrata is good but it's in big portion for 2-3 people. The food are tasty in general but the Normandy fresh oysters are kind of small. The bad thing is the noise - we couldn't have a good conversation among the three of us because of the noise around - from the other guests and the open kitchen. Don't think I will go back unless we are having a big party and don't mind the noise
1
Very terrible . We were the 2nd diner to come to the restaurant , and we got served the starter and the main dish never came. Only when we asked for it after 35 min , they explained that as we order three items, it takes longer to prepare . But that shouldn't be the restaurant standard !!! There were only two of us , if there are more than 2, does it mean our food took 1 hour to come ? Very horrible service and bad food too ! My first time trying this and very disappointing . Please , if you ever come to greenwood and to rubato , just order the coffee , as it is the most decent and fastest out of everything !!!Service is horrible! There are plenty of restaurants to go in greenwood , just not this

Was there with some friends for dinner and drinks. Tried the carbonara pasta and mushroom soup which was really good. Delicious food and wine selection was good. Great ambience with professional service staff. Will be back again.

Really nice restaurant with great staff. We went here for a nice easy Saturday evening meal. We had a slight issue with a dish which was immediately dealt with in a very friendly way. Simple, fresh, not too expensive. Just a good warm restaurant.
1
I've had two consecutive bad experiences with this restaurant. We had reserved a table and arrived on time. Starters arrived but after that we had to wait at least half an hour for our mains. Another table that came much later after us was served their mains before us. No apologies from the staff, no explanation. Very disappointing. Will think twice before returning agai

Brought my family to Rubato for dinner tonight as we were planning to have a nice and relaxing dinner away from city. I made reservations and fortunately, there were seats available. The person making the reservation was polite and rang me back to confirm my reservation.On arriving, we were seated inside at a corner just beside the kitchen. We ordered grilled squid, pasta, a pizza and fish. The food was fine but the service really needs to be improved. The waiter was impatient whilst taking our order, and he cleared our dish without asking if we had finished...there was still food left on the plate!Towards the end of the meal, my older son looked back and shouted "Rat!". There was a rat below another diner's table sitting diagonal to us! It scrambled under the chair of the diner, and reappeared 10 seconds later and scrambled under our table! We were all completely stunned. The rat subsequently squeezed through a hole into the kitchen!!!The staff came and asked if we would like to move tables. The head chef came by and laughed it off, saying it probably came from the sewers behind. There was no apology, and we were left sitting on our new table, completely uncomfortable and irked by the incident. It was only after 5 mins before the staff came to give us utensils - which he placed uncomfortably on our table. All the staff avoided looking at our table, and when we asked for the bill, it came along quickly...obviously trying to rid us off the restaurant quickly! What an experience. Good luck to the remaining diners and this is the last time I am visiting Rubato

Visited the restaurant for the first time with 2 friends for dinner last friday night. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very helpful staff who seated us at the bar while he tried to find us a table. We were eventually told a table would be ready for us in 5 mins. However, another family was seated at what was supposed to be our table and we were left waiting at the bar. The staff who originally spoke to us when we arrived was now no where to be seen. They finally realised the mix up and got us a table outside. The table however was not set (no plates or cutlery). Food and environment was pretty good overall but service was very mediocre. Had to ask for water (repeatedly) and also for serviettes. Seemed like they were understaffed for a Friday night
4
I had Sunday lunch here with my wife. The food, service and environment are great. We sat outside on the terrace which was very pleasant, I recommend sitting here. We started with grilled squid then had spaghetti aglio olio and a margarita pizza for mains. All items were delicious, it's clear that they are using high quality ingredients.
5
Great food, friendly and knowledgeable staff, very accommodating to kids requests and prepared a special birthday dessert that was delivered with two rounds of Happy Birthday. Refreshing to find a new restaurant with reasonable prices (especially for wine) and such a high standard of service. Will definitely be back. Great job

Made a reservation at Rubato for Christmas dinner for spouse @ 2 kids. Went there but was told only Christmas dinner available. Not fine. Saw another table of 2 families with kids having pizza and pasta not from the Christmas menu. Asked and was told that's because they had advance reservation. Fine. Saw another family with kids who settled down and was ready to order. Heard the man asked very loudly why they were not told of Christmas menu when they booked? They were then allowed to order from regular menu. Not fine! Christmas menu has no food suitable for my 2.5 yr old.The main course was too salty.To be fair the burrata was nice. Overall, the whole experience was totally destroyed but I kept quiet as I didn't want to ruin our family's Christmas dinner. 1) Why didn't Rubato tell us about Christmas menu over the phone when we booked? 2) Why was the other table allowed to order from regular menu after they kicked up a fuss? 3) Why did you ruin my Christmas dinner

I have to be moved by my dining experiences in order to review a restaurant. As I have owned my own restaurant and know the impact a good or bad review can have. Having said that, Rubato was probably one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. To start, we were pushed into a back table and literally expected to order straight away. Even being told to order quickly as they were expecting a lot of people and the kitchen can't cope. Sorry, but as far as I knew our money was the same as the other tables. And not really our fault that we arrived before the expected masses. The wine ordered didn't taste quite right and was a wine we were very familiar with. Discussions by our waitress with Chris the manager resulted in him (in full view of us) shrugging and shoving the bottle back into our ice bucket. Okayyyyyy! We couldn't get anyone to pour our wine so I poured it. First world problem, I know, but really, we had just complained about the wine! Our food was literally dumped on the table with such indifference by Chris the manager that it was quite uncomfortable. It was all just a bit too hard. I could go on. AND on, but you get the gist. The only highlight in a sea of atrocious service was a waiter named Jackson who was incredibly helpful, kind and sweet when we decided to leave and have the food packed up to go. I have NEVER done this in my life, to be clear, and truly understand the difficulties face by a full restaurant as I was the chef in my restaurant. So not something I did lightly. Three of six meals were not eaten. A truly disappointing experience that made us appreciate Mama Carmella a few doors up even more. Save your money

It is a typical modern restaurant with an open kitchen. At first glance, it was not too impressive when compared to the neighbouring Donna Carmela but we had a disastrous experience there and hence, we proceeded to try Rubato.A busy restaurant, you could see the wait staff moving quickly attending to the diners. The table that greeted us was such a pleasurable difference from Donna Carmela. The tables are wide with plenty of arm space.At all times, the wait staff were courteous and personable, making us feel welcome. We ordered squid ink pasta, pizza and a main course. All were good. Although not the best I had, I could not really fault it. What made the dining experience great were the staff who knew how to recommend wines and always made sure we were attended to even as the crowd had built up.Initially, we only wanted a bottle of wine and because of the good experience, we ordered another bottle. All in all, a restaurant with attentive service made our evening so much more pleasurable!Well done, Rubato
4
We ordered 4 main courses, fries, 1 dessert and 1 kids meal. Our total was less than $150. Considered reasonable.
My risotto was nicely done. Son's aglio olio was tasty too. The fries were really
tasty. Dessert menu looks interesting. Give it a try!
2
It was advertised as having the freshest seafood for the day but been to Rubato a few times and they had issues sustaining their freshness/quality in my opinion. Ok for a simple meal but don't expect much. New location is nicer but similar mindset of management still remains.
2
We live nearby and have been here a few times. Three times now they've served us the wrong thing (our orders aren't complicated). It's meant that our main courses have been served 15 or 20 minutes apart while the re-make one of the dishes.The food isn't great either. There are three other better Italian restaurants in this plaza - definitely prefer each of those to this on
4
Our football supporters club chose to have our Christmas dinner at this restaurant which was an excellent choice. Modern, trendy decor in a no hurry atmosphere. Extensive wine list - range of other drinks. Chose the lobster bisque soup to start and fillet steak - medium for main course. Perfectly cooked - maybe would have been nice to have more vegetables - a point that others made too. Had the baked Alaska for dessert - again - excellent!! Service was good but when restaurant became busy (Sat evening) clearly staff were stretched. After dinner requested staff to call a taxi for me, but seems they were too busy to attend to this. A very nice meal and reasonably priced
4
Love the Caprese Salad (with Buffalo Mozzarella), and pizza crust is consistently light. The Baked Alaska was mediocre, I felt.There is a swing door leading to the restroom and wash basin, so you don't need to touch the door handle after washing hands and going back to the food! Service is prompt, once you catch ther server's attention, even when they are not so busy
3
It's like they try too hard. A 5 cheese pizza with two of them from goat? And no tomato sauce? That only made it expensive stinky goo on a thin, yet nonetheless undercooked crust. And that was what they put in front of my 10 year old at 9:30 pm. He actually cried. The rest of our entrees were so-so as well. The carbonara was greasy - a tendency for that dish, which is why it has to be done carefully. Still, it's standard Italian fare and if you can't execute it well, don't put it on the menu. The atmosphere is monochromatic and sophisticated - more a place for date night than a family dinner. They seem to put a lot of effort into their alcoholic offerings, which wasn't our focus when out with the kids and grandparents. Service was fair. We did show up with a party of 6 and no reservations and they fit us in with only a short wait. Portions were on the small side but adequate. We live very nearby and the menu has a number of offerings that tempt. I'm hoping if I try them again I can find something they do well. Prices are inflated - but this is a sit-down full service restaurant in Singapore, on Greenwood. For what it offers and where it is, the cost wasn't so bad or unanticipated. I just wish the kitchen did a better job...

premise - nice decor but yet simple and pleasing to the eyelocation - good place if early, valet available but if on evenings / weekends, be prepared to park some distance away, do be mindful of residents who are in the area as some may be prone to complain to LTA regarding parking within their residential proximitystaff - good and friendly and attentivecrowd - mainly couples and guests from the areafood - all good! get the buff mozz!!!!!! MUST EAT!!!!price - it's very fair for the portion servedverdict - smitten! I WILL SOOOOOO BE BACK!!

Very Very Very good Italian food! Its a good neighborhood restaurant.The Iberico Pork Rack and Loin were excellent.All of the dishes were cooked perfectly.We sat at the table with a view of the kitchen and the chef tasted every dish out of the line. We seldom see this in a restaurant.The Squid Ink pasta was one of the best I have tried.Basically this restaurant stood out in my book.It is not a tourist trap and its in a neighborhood so its sort of out of the way for the tourist but its worth a D tour.Everything was well priced with comparable food in the CBD area
4
Went there for a meal with my family and really enjoyed it. Had come recommended by friends who ate there a few days earlier.Ordered the burata, parma ham & melon, pizzas, aglio olio and ravioli. The meat quality was superb.The burata and the ravioli were both particularly outstanding.Great atmosphere, good food and very good service, complimented with reasonable prices.A definite revisit for us
5
Rubato is one of the finest Italian restaurants in Singapore. The ambience is warm, the staff are friendly and very professional. The food is excellent. The presentation is very tasteful. Marcus, the owner is very approachable and will come to your table to discuss any dietary concerns.Very highly recommended. A definite *****!!!

Lovely Italian restaurant, truly the secret Italian kitchen.
My favorites are, fresh sea clams in white wine, charcoal grilled squid, ossobuco, veal ravioli with truffle porcini.
Great selection of wine, hand picked by the owner himself!
A must try!!!

Attended an event in May 2014. Didn't expect much as food served at most of these events were of average standard. But I must say I was pleasantly surprised when the food turned out to be very good. It was a 3 course dinner. Starter was the usual buratta cheese, ham, cherry tomatoes, rockettes, etc...to be shared by 4 person. It was very good and all 4 of us finished the huge amount that was served. For the main course I have chosen the wagu beef while hubby had the lobster with pasta. The wagu beef was well marinated and perfectly cooked. The pasta that was served with the lobster was very good too.Will return for their wagu beef and also try the others dishes

Dined here on a busy Friday evening when they were hosting an event indoors. It was super packed and noisy. It was quite evident that the restaurant staffs were stretched but I have to say they worked pretty efficiently.We ordered their hand stretched buffalo mozzarella buratta which came with rocket salad and cherry tomatoes. The serving was huge and the dish was excellent. We had mushroom pizza for mains. The pizza was above average. The pizza base was neither soggy nor crispy. The mushrooms were fresh and the truffle oil gave a nice aroma to the the pizza. For desserts we had Tiramisu which was just average. Too much of cocoa dusting spoilt the dish. We also had a molten lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and fresh berries. This dish was excellent! They don't have mock tails in their menu so I asked if they could make one for me. The bartender came to our table and recommended Jamaican fruit punch and it was pretty nice. Overall, it was a nice experience with tasty pizza and desserts. The dishes were reasonably priced. The staffs were very polite and efficient. Definitely a gem of greenwood avenue. There is complimentary valet parking too. It was pretty helpful as the car park was full when arrived

Been a regular since their Clover Park days and have been to the new Greenwood location twice over the last few months. I am familiar with the menu so usually order from among this list:1. Charcoal grilled squid. Wonderful how they execute it so brilliantly with so few basic ingredients :)2. Burratina, a must try but sadly out of stock the last 2 times 3. Veal ravioli. Very well balanced mushroom cream sauce, hand made ravioli. Excellent but a tad small in terms of serving size.4. Chicken Saltimbocca: same sauce as above but with Parma ham and an excellent mash. My favourite chicken chop in Singapore right now :) 5. Pastas are all spot on, not too rich and the balance is very agreeable to my palete. Vongole (made with Proseco), Aglio Olio (with char grill prawns), not "traditional" style but a must order as I like ordering basic, difficult to hide if cooking if not up to scratch dishes :) The pizzas rock as well, especially the one with the raw yolk (can't remember the name)Only slight issue is the air con inside tends to be too cold/windy especially with the fans going at full blast (when the restaurant is not full). I would go for outdoor if possible.Overall a trusted place for Italian food and kudos that its run by a local (well done, Chef Marcus!) Looking forward to our next visit

I looked forward to this new Greenwood location - which is more popular and the ambience is, well, a very pleasant modern trattoria. Cleverly done!While waiting at the bar, we saw the cute bartenders, 1 of whom we knew from another establishment and started a chat. In the end we stayed at the bar and enjoyed it.2 of us shared grilled squid, mussels and a caesar.salad. These were served promptly and were all scrumptious. There was a bit of a wait before the Mains, one of the bartenders noticed and checked on it. The veal cheek and the pork then arrived. Veal was done to perfection, the pork was average- pity as I ordered the more expensive cut!The waiter had suggested medium for the pork as it is well aged, but I've always heard that pork should not be served pink and did not follow his advice. The tenderness was fine.Doppio was good, above average. Chocolate Ice cream was just chocolate ice cream. Our rating: Another good joint for good Italian food without breaking the bank. Having said all that, I prefer to support locally owned and run establishments that do the basics well. Good food, classic dishes that taste good and are satisfying. So, this establishment "does the job", good food, reasonable prices and satisfying for the overall dining experience. The lobster bisque was my favorite from before - and must remember to try it here, next time

We were walk-ins for lunch on Sunday and were seduced by the sign advertising New Zealand oysters. We shared 9 oysters, a green salad, a mushroom pizza and a chocolate fondant. Highlights were the pizza, which was light, crispy and delicious and the chocolate fondant. The mixed green salad was ordered off menu, as there was none on the menu, and it was ho hum at best - a few leaves dressed with a vinaigrette that was over heavy on the balsamic vinegar. The ice cream that accompanied the dessert was an insult to the chocolate fondant; it purported to be vanilla, but tasted of nothing but the chemical aftertaste you get with cheap product. No bread was offered, an ungenerous omission in an Italian restaurant. Service was polite and well meaning, but a little haphazard during a busy Sunday lunch service. I would go again, but just for the pizza

We had dinner there recently and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. I cant see how people can call it expensive when the pastas are below 20 a dish. The oysters were terrific, grilled squid nice and the pastas, pizzas above average. service was prompt and the food were served well timed in between courses. we are looking to go back there again, soon

I couldn't disagree more with the bad reviews here! We live nearby to Rubato and have been to this place at least 5 times now. It's our go to place if we want a top noch dining experience close to home - let's be clear, the food is fine dining, so if you have a sensitive wallet you will feel it; but for those who believe in 'what you pay for is what you get', Rubato will not let you down!My favourites are: the Vongole to start (which they source FRESH everday :D - this is the only place I'll eat clams in Singapore because too many other places use old or frozen seafood)And the Spanish Pork loin with truffle infused mash (this is actually both my and my husband's favourite dish at the moment - mind blowing savoury deliciousness!!!)It's a small place and in the suburbs so expect families, but by far the best food outside the central districts

Pick this Italian restaurant in the heartland for convenience more than anything at first but I found myself going back twice more within a couple of months. The restaurant is actually located in an area that's quite inaccessible unless you drive but surprisingly, it is always packed with a good dinner crowd especially, even on weekdays. Despite the location, their pricing is on par with restaurants in the town area. But the food is nice and they carry decent collection of wine. The owner is very hospitable, goes around chatting up the diners to make sure they are pleased with the food and service. All in all, the place gives you a cosy feel almost as if you are having dinner at home. Definitely on my GOTO list of eating places in Singapore. However, be prepared to spend $$$.

Had dinner at Rubato's as I read a few good reviews and it's hidden in a quiet corner at Upper Thomson, thought it would be quite a adventure and a good discovery.The service was great without pressure and very patient being our first trip there, felt very comfortable. The appetiser was excellent, we shared the grilled squid ($28), and a stew seafood soup ($32), nice but costly. The main course, I had the chicken chop ($27) which is a let down, reminds me of the hawker centre western food, but the sauce is excellent. My wife had the Ravioli ($26), which is not too bad, my wife waited abt 15mins after my main course arrived, not an ideal situation for an 'uptown' experience! the food shld come together or close together.For desert it is heavenly, the Choc Fondant ($13.80) and Tiramisu ($12.80) is I felt the best part of the dinner, good and reasonable for its quality, however be warned, we waited >45mins for it. The deco is nicely done but being seated by the glass facade, the view out is gross, next door is the laundrette though there is a bamboo panel to try to hide that view. total damage is $190 for two with moscato (@$18). Conclusion is its not too bad a dinner, but for its price, I could get a equally nice food at a more swanky uptown trattoria in town. I would expect the price to be much lower at such location which wld had made the whole expereince worth the trip as we can't expect all, but since the price position itself as an uptown visit, it fails in this respect
