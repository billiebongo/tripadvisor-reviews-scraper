If you are looking for some traditional Mexican food, this is a great option! It is located on the river and has plenty of outdoor seating. The food was seriously good.
4
Excellent food and fantastic service! The waiter was extremely helpful and it seemed like he didn't have any other guests!! The food was delivered fast. Highly recommended!!!
4
We enjoyed the mexican food and magaritas, but feel funny when a pint of beer is served less than 0.48L. With the marking on the glass, it's very glaring to give customer less. Bartender! Please buck up.
5
Great tex-mex at reasonable prices with nice atmosphere (Riverside Point location). The nachos are great and I like the Chile Stew.
4
Good for causal dining and happy hours has great value for money. Good view of Clarke Quay. Great food and margaritas !
4
Had dined here twice before this. Good for a change from the usual Asian & European fare in Singapore. Reasonable pricing & nice ambience at Riverside Point.
4
Very nice location with a good view of the river thru Clark Quay. Happy hour until 7pm or after 10pm, but very limited happy hour selection. Overall the food was mostly good except that the beef chimichanga was overcooked and dry.
2
We waited for our food for almost 30 mins and they forgot our order. We had to wait for another 15 mins. It was my husband bday.
5
Every time we passed the restaurant it was always very busy which we took as a good sign. So when we managed to get a table we couldnâ€™t wait to sample the food. Whilst we waited for our meals they bought us free tasty fresh nachos with dips to eat which was a nice surprise. We ordered a chimchanga and chicken fajitas and they were fabulous. Although the restaurant was busy it was a very enjoyable atmosphere. If we had been in Singapore for longer we would have definitively have returned
4
I've visited Cafe Iguana many times over the years and on our last visit it was still offering good food and drink but the restaurant is now very busy and crowded. That's not an issue if you're fine with crowds, but just be aware. Fajitas are still great and the margaritas were far too easy to drink. :
5
This is one of our favorite spots in Singapore and we come here for a meal every year. The nachos are a big hit. Be sure to try the chimichanga. It is big enough to share.
5
Very good food and service! Price point is a bit on the high side! But the quality of the food was great! Lots of options for a vegetarian!
4
Love their chimichanges and nachos! Definitely worth the price as the portion was huge. Good service despite the crowd.
5
Perfect nachos & best margarita in town.
Lovely & efficient Service
Our most common place for every outing & friends meet up is this very good Mexican!
5
The food is very good and tasty, however it is very expensive for Mexican food. Recommended visit here.
4
High standard margarita comes with complimentary piping hot nacho chips with salsa dip. We ordered a jar of margarita (lime) and chilled by the riverside.
3
Food was ok.
Margaritas much smaller than i last remembered. Was a tad disappointed.
Jalapeno poppers were good though
5
Great service and great Margaritas. Nachos were delicious. The staff were friendly, good Riverside cafe.
4
The food here is consistently tasty. I think the best thing on the menu is the steak tacos with homemade corn tortillas! A lovely view of the river. Plus, how often do you find a Mexican restaurant in Singapore that has free chips and salsa? Admittedly, though, the food is expensive; then again, what Mexican food in Singapore isn't expensive
4
After a long day walking round the sights of Singapore, my wife and I were in that strange place of being hungry but not really knowing what we wanted to eat......we looked at a number of restaurants but nothing really grabbed our attention. We had looked at Iguana and mentally stored it away as a possible and walked on for a bit, until the thought of some Mexican food got the better of us, so back we went.Iguana is not a restaurant that relies on pictures of their food to attract customers but rather with the quality and style of their restaurant.The food was good, authentic tasty and as zesty as you want it, the stuffed Jalapenos were really tasty, hot (temperature wise) and not to hot (Chilli wise), and my enchilada was a real meal tasty and filling..(but I managed it).The service was good and we were well looked after and with the riverside setting there was plenty of opportunity to sit and talk interspersed with a spot of watching the world go by.Singapore is not an inexpensive city to visit however I would definitely consider revisiting Iguana if I find myself in that neck of the woods ever agai
5
Many thanks Jack and James for the wonderful service. Kitchen served excellent beef fajitas. The bar kept up its reputation in serving great margaritas.
4
Great food
Service is fine and the food is well worth the wait
Recommend the burritos
Decor needs updating
4
Cafe Iguana is always a good choice for a hearty Tex Mex by Singapore's scenic river on Clarke Quay.
5
Surely the best nachos & drinks are done here!
100% value for Money
Cool & calm atmosphere
Should Include Kids Menu too!
4
First time visit to this bar/Cafe. I really enjoyed the ambience, margaritas and food. Dating people can consider this place. Service is good.
5
First time visiting, good experience, loved the ambiance, great food but limited choices on beverages.
4
After drinking 11 jugs of margaritas, you can expect quite a rowdy bunch. 9 of us squeezed into a cosy corner and had loads of fun. We tried all the margaritas available and concluded that strawberry was still the best. Service was great but it took a little longer to get their attention as we were in the corner. Great fun. Would get back there again soon.

I've been patronising Cafe Iguana for 8 years now. Love their margaritas and food! Despite them serving free tortillas with an awesome salsa dip, I've always ordered a large portion of their baked nachos.. It is to die for! Not to mention their tequilla grilled chicken.But all this means NOTHING is your staff are poorly trained! The line was drawn when your staff accused me of being cheap! SERIOUSLY?? Even after I raked up a 270++ dollar bill? SC**W you.You seriously need to retrain your staff. I highly DO NOT recommend this restaurant based on my ONE bad experience last night even though I've been here countless times and recommended a lot of people here. I revoke my recommendation
2
The order taking was all messed up... we clearly indicated no raw onions in our food and yet when delivered it was full of it. Typically the sautÃ©ed veges in the enchilada are done properly however this time they almost seemed raw. We requested for an extra bit of salsa with the nachos they had served and promptly we were charged for it with the waitress making a face for us asking... overall a sad experience for what we thought to be good place which we have frequented many a tim
5
I have always frequent Iguana. Quality of food has been maintained through the years. The staff are also friendly and mindful I their service. The wide range of exotic spirits is to die for. This place makes an excellent spot for group meet up as well. Easily the top 5 restaurant for myself. :
3
Nice view overlooking the harbour..food are average but margaritas are great..overall just ok..got the outside smoking area!!
4
Nice place to spend evening with family and friends at Clarke Quay. Good Margaritas and good food - though expensive.
3
Returned here with a 1 for 1 Entertainer promo. My companion and I both got tacos, and I have to say the quality was only so so. Service was very prompt and good though.
4
Tacos and quesadillas are awesome. Churros was a disappointment though, dry and the Avocado ice cream that comes with it has a slightly sour aftertaste.
5
Excellent Mexican food in a very pleasant ambience. Nice décor and nice people, the service is attentive, everything at a reasonable price. We loved the nachos and margarita (50% off after 10pm). Go there with friends for a lively dining experience.
5
Good restaurant, including service and food. Super busy so if you're looking for a quiet spot, this isn't for you.
5
We have been a common face in Cafe Iguana as we simply love the food and the awesome kickass Margaritas.Our last visit last Sunday 1st October 2017 is even better when we were served by Howie.Simple looking young man, speaks professionally and is is such a joy getting to speak to him.The first time ever anyone has been to our table while we were dining there,be it for food ,the margaritas or both, to do small chats on food and anything under the sun. Good job Howie!!We hope to be served by Howie again next time...CheersX
4
came here for lunch, tried their burrito and it was good, they also give free nachos which is nice gesture. i don't drink alcohol so i didn't try their cocktail. but for me, the service is quite slow, i waited for solid 10 mins until the waiter took my order.since i'm a cheapskate, this food considerably pricey for me
3
Came here because of entertainer 1 for 1 but was told that F1 period redemption is not allowed. We ordered the fish taco which was not bad but the fish tastes abit like barbeque chicken. We had the deep fried taco with steak strips too. It is not the crispy taco that we were expecting. In fact it the skin is more like deep fried spring roll skin that has very thick crust. Not a big fan of too much flour though. Overall average experience.
3
Been here a few years ago, the quality was better. This visit i found the quality had dropped. Chicken dishes were ok, but all the beef dishes were below average. The beef did not taste fresh. The New York steak was ordered medium but arrived well done. It lack taste and beef was like a frozen piece put on a grill. I guess the margarita's are still a favorite here. A friendly place overall and staff were friendly.
4
Having a night out of Clarke Quay? Home to numerous great bars and clubs. Avoid the hangover with a hearty meal at Cafe Iguana. Tasty Tex Mex food and perfect river views.
4
Delicious mexican food and lively restaurant. Despite open air concept, it did not feel hot as there were fans all around. Nice view of the Singapore River. Service was good too.
4
Good place to chill
Can be a little noisy indoors, so it's good to sit outdoors if you want a quieter spot
5
I have eaten in a few Mexican restaurant in Singapore but cafe iguana have been the best.
Excellent service and awesome food and great ambience
4
Compared to other Mexican places in Singapore, I would say that Cafe Iguana has the best prices, best portions, and best atmosphere (overlooking the Singapore River). I ordered an "Iguanarita" (I think that was the name) - the signature "margarita"... I didn't read the fine print, and realized too late that it was half margarita, half beer - I do not recommend it. Chips and salsa free of charge - as it should be! Delicious. I ordered the carnitas tacos, which were large and filling, but real carnitas is seasoned, pulled pork, whereas this was diced and seasoned pork. Seasoning didn't quite hit the mark, but they were still tasty. I will be returning, I am sure
5
Went there with my friend because she recommended this place:) Environment was lively and chill. Although the place is smaller compared to other restaurants, the food (soft tacos)served was generous in portion and we had trouble finishing them! However, despite the big portion, the food was awesome and tasty! The tacos was only $21 so we thought it was value for money!! Definitely recommended to visit here
5
We ate here with two relatively fussy kids. 12YO tried Burrito a my insistence and loved it; 8YO had a chicken quesadilla from the kids menu and liked that, too. Adults had delicious burritos and beer from the nearby micro-brewery, Lovely location; sat outside facing the river with very welcome fans keeping us cool. I'd recommend it for families
5
My friend is a fan for more than 10 years and we've been here umpteen times. Love the food, drinks and atmosphere here. It's as close to Mexico as we can get on the equator of the east! P/S: Love the heat from the chilli and peppers
4
We enjoyed this place last saturday. We arrived there at about 10.30pm and they still had many dishes to offer (half the menu was unavailable so near to closing time). Kitchen was about to close at that time, however we still got some delicious food. The service was quite quick. The outside area had a reasonable amount of space in between tables, so there was some intimacy. The food was high quality and the price was acceptable, specially because of the area. Had good vegetarian options and the Margaritas were OK on the alcohol level (not too low).Recommend, specially for late night diningand they give complimentary nachos and tomato sauce
2
We visited Iguana on our last day in Singapore and sat at an outside table with river view. Our server informed us that the table we had sat at could not be utilised until 6pm (it was 5pm and every single outside table was empty) and pointed to a dark table inside just 6ft away. When taking our order, our server walked over and just said "yes" as in yes what do you want and then contributed to abruptly throw the food and cutlery down on the table. He had a real attitude problem and I thoroughly resented the "service" charge that was automatically added to our bill. The food was just OK.Wouldn't return as felt like we were putting the server out by just being there
4
The food is really nice and warm. They will offer you a complementary chips and salsa too. but i hope they will extend the happy hours to 8 pm instead of 7 pm.
5
Food is authentically Mexican, serving size is generous, spacious seat at the high-chair bar section for our family of 7. We will be back !
5
Cafe Iguana is always a reliable place to go for some good Tex Mex nosh. Located at Clarke Quay with fabulous river views. The area is buzzing and great fun.
4
Massive portion and worth the money. Cheap jug of margarita in the afternoon! Generous serving of meat, so good for sharing!
5
Food was great! Big portions so worth it for the price. Love the margaritas. All the flavors tasted great!!!
5
The Mexican food was amazing and the Margaritas were fantastic. We had a great waitress who made the night even more memorable.
5
Definitely not my first time here, had recommended this place to many of friends. Went there this time with my colleagues who were not very sure that they will like the food. By the end of the night, they thoroughly enjoyed themselves & kept raving about the beef and how fresh the chips (in the nachos) was.
5
I'm a local and have visited this place more than 10 times alr. I usually drop by for the half price (after 10pm) frozen margaritas with some friends - consistently good! Food wise - I'd say: the best mexican food in town, though they are rather pricey (25 - 35 ish) per mains, but the portions are really reasonable. Must try: Frozen Mageritas - lime**, mango** (everything is lime-based); grilled beef fajitas (try the mexican sauces
4
It was a pleasant surpice as they serve tortilla chips for free! Great to pair with margaritas at their happy hour before 7 -($40 for abt 7 servings). Had their prawn fajitas and pork soft taco. Pretty decent too! Will be back for sure. :) Great interior deco though i think their restaurant is not air conditioned.
3
Nice atmosphere, friendly and professional staff. Mixed feelings about food. Very good appetizers (we had awesome mini chimichangas and nachos). Then for main course the shredded meat in tacos was overcooked, too dry and not tender. Also, the meat of the fajitas wasn't super tender and quite an issue with kids. The dessert was average. The margarita was OK, but not perfect
3
Nice location, lovely spot.
We had beef fajitas: the meat is good.
We had margarita too, which was fine.
4
We had Mexican food, very tasty.
Drinks were also good.
Price is expensive
Ambience is good as well.
5
Visited here for lunch, ordered refillable cokes, taco salad and chicken fajitas. Whilst we were waiting we received complimentary chips and salsa. Bill came to approx $60.
Great food, quick service, and friendly waiter.
5
Among the best Mexican restaurants in Singapore. Watch out for the American sized portions - thankfully our waiter warned us while ordering.
2
Superb location, great staff but the food...so disappointed by the nachos "swimming" in all ingredients...and if these are tacos...not a taste of Mexico for me, sorry.
4
Many delicious dishes tried on our first visit.
Service was good.
We dined al fresco - a little warm & crowded on a Sunday night.
Noisy too - a group of drunk guys was singing loudly.
4
Used to frequent Iguanas some 8 years ago when we lived in Batam. Took a trip back there recently and wasnt let down. Great quality at a reasonable price. Thanks for a great night
4
Visited here for dinner with friends. The vegetarian food was really good, specially the tacos. The food portions are really huge. We were very hungry and ended up over ordering. Its better to ask the staff and order so you don't end up over ordering. The offer complementary chips and the refillable coke is a value buy. The pricing is a bit on the higher side but the ambiance and location makes up for it. The staff is really courteous and helpful
4
Came on a holiday to Singapore and spent an evening with friends at Cafe Iguana. One of the best Margaritas in town....specially the lime one. Comfortable and cool sitting outside....not a claustrophobic atmoshere. Food is good too. We have grilled chicken fajitas, chicken quisiddillas, taco salad. All yummy stuff
4
To start, I really can not give any place I have found outside of North America a 5 rating for Tex/Mex...there is a gap. However, this is the best I have found in Singapore, or really the region.Food is delicious. Traditional fare such as quesadillas, nachos, enchiladas, etc whilst somewhat basic dishes are well prepared and come with a touch of differentiation. Beyond the norm, the menu has a number of more unique dishes on the menu, which looked quite good. Margaritas are also quite swell, and the happy hour pricing is a very good value.the staff are quit good, and very attentive. Only negative is the manager running around looking rather frazzled and unhappy...he could really learn something from his staff
4
Cafe Iguana serves good mecican food. This place was intreduced to us 6-7 years ago by out mexican-american friends and we visit this place once or twice a year. Staff is not as great but food, locatio n is perfect
4
The diner at Iguana was very nice. The meals were very tasteful and the beers and margarita were very good as well. You sit beside the river which is nice.
4
Love this place. Always visit while in Singapore. Good food, especially the burritos, and good beer from up the road at Brewworks.
5
Great food portion for sharing and chilling with friends. Waiter was prompt and responsive. Almost full house daily for dinner. 50% off all margaritas daily after 10pm
5
Love the food and ambience. The quantity is very good but it's a little pricey. Nice place and good service. Had a great time there!
4
We were there to celebrate my mum's birthday, cos she'd had a craving for mexican food, more specifically chimichangas which isn't common nowadays. We ordered 2 appetisers - the tiger prawn quesadillas and taco salad, as well as 4 main courses - 2 steak chimichangas, 1 pork soft taco and 1 steak. It was quite a lot of food for 4 people, i feel we could have cut on one main course and one appetiser. However, the food was really good, tasted authentic. The appetisers especially were fantastic, we enjoyed the tiger prawn quesadillas
3
I love fish tacos and this restaurant did 3 giant ones. Maybe I was not as hungry as I thought as I could only eat one. Maybe it was the complimentary nachos and delicious salsa that did me in. My spouse had the chicken fajitas and could only eat half. So very generous servings but average tasting. The restaurant is on the river walk so very busy and noisy which we enjoyed. As we were unaware that nachos & salsa would be served we ordered nachos. We did not care for them at all. Without asking it was removed from the bill. Nice ! Beer was delicious. Go for the action, not necessarily the food
3
I'm Californian born and raised. We have a fair number of authentic Mexican restaurants around so I think I know Mexican food. This place is more Tex-Mex than anything but given you're so far from Mexico they don't do a horrible job. The tortillas however are more like thin Nan. maybe it's the humidity
4
Consistently good tex mex at Cafe Iguana. Located at Riverside Point, opposite Clarke Quay, this is a fun venue for a night out. Located on the scenic river, it has an upbeat atmosphere. Good consistent food, good sized portions, great cocktails, a dead cert for a good night out
4
A local friend of mine brought me hear for a couple of pitchers of the House Margaritas â€” an excellent idea. And as we had come in early, each pitcher was SGD 40. After 7pm it goes up to SGD 56.And from 12pm to 3pm it's half price at SGD 28!!
3
Well located at Clark Quay, this is a good Mexican food option that just happens to have one of the best tequila selections anywhere.
Check out the best of the best in tequilas.
5
Dining by the riverside is always a plus. Went to this restaurant twice in 3 months with 2 different groups and the food never disappoint each time. Service was good as the waiters and waitress were attentive. View overlooking the Singapore River on a cool evening as the sun sets and turns into night while having food at this restaurant was very chill-laxing. Must try is the Nachos! Will definitely be back again soon
4
I visited Cafe Iguana for dinner with colleagues in a very cool night. The restaurant sits near the canal with plenty of outside sitting so if the weather allows it's a great place for dinner or drinks.I had the beef chimichanga and the dark beer. Portions are big and the food tasty.They will also bring some chips and sauce to get the conversation going.Service was nice but not particularly efficient since we had to request the same thing repeatedly (mainly drinks) but there was a lady that managed to solve any delay.Overall a nice place to go for dinner
5
One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Singapore. With a great view next to the Singapore river, especially in the evening with a nice breeze, it's a perfect spot for a pitcher of margaritas and some nachos followed up by a great burrito or fajitas. My office is nearby and I have taken several dinner meetings here; always a good meal with decent service (decent is my high rating for service in Singapore
5
The service here is one of the best I've had in Singapore! Warm and friendly yet casual.Ambience is great! Right by the river with views of the city, nice and windy. Sitting outdoors is a must!I highly recommend the Tequila Chicken (juicy, tender and yummy) and the Nachos. The burrito was passable. Margaritas were good. Happy hour promotions are before 7pm and after 10p
4
We like Cafe Iguana for authentic Mexican food, sitting along the Singapore River and my bride still enjoys their margaritas (I haven't taken alcohol since 2013). The service is from great to okay but the margarita specials before 8 pm and after 10 pm are 40-50% off so if you drink... enjoy. The first order of chips and salsa is complimentary.
4
A cute bar restaurant by the riverside. Enjoy dinner while watching people stroll by. Half of the tables are inside and half outside at a one meter elevated porch. It has smoking and non smoking section. Mexican cuisine like fajitas and steak. Always busy so there must be something alluring by the place. A portrait of Frida at the wall and a nicely decorated bar. Friendly staff.Colorful metal frame chairs add to the outside. Typical prices for Singapore. A Fajitas platter costs 27 SGD
5
Awesome service, highly attentive and left with a full, content and chilled out feeling!Staff helped with our two year old, fed and watered my family and all with great Brewerkz beers and homemade chow. Well worth a visit if you're on Clarke Quay. My Wife was most impressed. She loves a mouthful of spicy Mexican.
4
A great destination slightly up river in the Clark Quay area and well worth the journey. High quality mexican food and sensational frozen margaritas. Can be expensive based on time of the day you drink / eat (prices vary according to the time) but well worth it. The service is excellent and its a great place to have a drink and snack and people watch or go for a full dining experience. The margarita's rate highly and well worth the dollars. Yummo
4
Our first night in Singapore we came by this restaurant at Clarke Quay. Nice location with views on the river and bars/restaurants of Clarke Quay. Service and staff was good. The Mexican food is good. We all took Fajita, some with chicken, some with prawns and some with beef. We were all satisfied, big portion and great taste
5
Been to Iguana couple of times. Never failed to order Prawn Bruchetta.
Classic Margarita by jug is happy hour offering 50% discount from SGD 56 after 2200hrs.
Great music and ambiance. Clean toilet and fast service.
3
Batting the beer from brewerkz, nothing special. The fajitas were okay.
Nothing more to say; nothing in the menu read different.
5
We loved the food - lots of it and very tasty. Also the special deal on Margaritas. If you book you can have a table by the river.
5
Sadly many people have left Singapore so CI a bit empty. However the free wings with a jug of Margarita made up for it so had another one but had the great Fajitas for dinner instead of more free wings.
3
Between is we tried a burrito and fajitas. Both were quite okay. We also tried the Brewerkz IPA and the Stout which were pretty good on draft. We were sitting at the bar and the place was not particularly busy on a Wednesday evening. The guy behind the bar served us sporadically and spent most of his time distracted by other tasks such that we had to demand attention when we needed it.The location n Clark Quay is quite pleasant and the bar is open to the walkway along the river giving an inside-outside feel. We had a pleasant enough evening but nothing here would lead us to return, given the extensive choice of alternatives in the area
2
We stopped by here initially to have a quick drink and was suggested by the waiter to get a jug of margarita. We ended up having 2 and near closing time, they shouldn't just move you out onto a different section and close the restaurant, pretty rude staff at the end who only seemed interested in going home. Plenty of other places open with friendly staff to spend your money in. Don't go here....
4
Came here on a crowded Saturday evening. Was given a table pretty quick. Wait time was about 5 min. Love that they provide complimentary nachos with salsa dip while waiting to order and for the food to arrive. We always go for the Quesadillas and nacho set. This time we got soft tacos as well. Food was served incredibly fast. The margarita was strong and well mixed.But the experience was made unforgettable by the amazing service of Syaz. He gave good suggestions, was friendly, and came to check on us and our food after it was served, which really left a lasting impression on us. Not many service personnel or establishments do that. He was extremely professional, and took pride in his job (vs the other chinese female staff, who looked grouchy and took her own initiative to clear our table without checking with us)Could tell that other patrons appreciated him too. I even enquired about the unique Frieda Khalo painting on the wall, and although he didn't know much about it, he checked up on it and came back to tell us more about it. Amazing! Overall, was generally a good experience dining at the cafe, and excellent service. The Iguana did not disappoint, and we will definately be back.
4
We had dinner here and we enjoyed the overall experience. Ambiance and service are good. We ordered 2 appetizers, 1 main course, 2 desserts and 2 drinks. The appetizers were too good - quesadilla and nacho salad. We totally loved them. Iguana beer was good too. We dint like the veg bowl we orded for main course. It was just ok. Overall we enjoyed the time we spent there.
4
There is nothing which can beat the location with the river and clark quay in background. Food came quick and the chef did a great job with garnishing. Price is ok for Singapore & location. Serive was decent. Their nachos were crispy & different & sauces used not your typical mexican off the shelf stuff. Definitely Worth a visit.
4
Epic nachos and margaritas. My wife and I shared the large nacho plate, couldn't even finish it!The restaurant has a laid back vibe and nice view overlooking the river. It wasn't overly crowded or noisy this visit, but we've been here before when it was busier
3
We had a family meal here. Perfectly serviceable but nothing very special and prices seemed quite high.
5
This place is just plain awesome! From the red chain operated firehouse doors to the industrial chic interior. Iguanas has been a staple in Singapore for years.A tried and true formula: good food + good service = great experience.Their salsa is simply addictive. Too bad only the first bowl of chips' salsa is free ;-)I'd also suggest the Megarita to go from 0 to Hammered as fast as possible
2
We went for dinner and the food was great but the service was a little off. The waiter kept correcting me on the pronunciation of "tortilla" which was pretty funny because I'm from Texas and he almost insisted that I pronounce the L's. Then for some reason they almost refused to sell me extra tortillas. We waited for a very long time to order, then had to wait a very ling time for our food. We ordered guacamole two times to eat with our chips before our meals. It finally came after our food.The food was decent but they should really do some training for their wait staff
4
An enjoyable meal by the river. Frozen margaritas were a big hit. Refillable soft drinks for the kids. Nachos for starters could have been a meal in itself. Food was really good however it was much too spicy (even when we requested 'mild') for the kids.A great atmosphere with locals sitting on the bridge chatting and Clarke Quay filling up for the evening
3
We loved cafe iguana great locale and it's easy decorThe food esp the burritos and chemis were just right and the spicy sauces really complement the cuisine The waiter was really attentive and prompt though the head waiter (a grumpy Chinese bloke) was unwelcoming (despite our reservations) which was a shameThe ratings would improve I am sure with better staff training. By the way the breakfast on the weekends is reasonable but a little price
2
Ok so the margaritas are good, and so are the corn chips and salsa to go with it. They have tiered happy hour prices also the drinks can be reasonably affordable before 3pm. However our last lunch trip was off-putting. We sat outside and the way the waitress was clearing tables was quite inconsiderate. They had a stand to store the used plates and cutlery and the waitress was literally throwing the plates and cutlery in it. The glass and metal cutlery made quite a noise when they were thrown and it was distracting and interrupting. We moved tables away from the stand but she was so rough and noisy we still were affected by the noise. I even asked her if she could be gentler with the dishes but it didn't look like she cared. Unfortunately we weren't left with a choice but to leave and go continue our lunch at another restaurant. I have not returned to Iguana since
4
Spent a wonderful evening in the restaurant. I really liked the food (cannot say anything about dishes that included meat or fish as I am a vegetarian). And then this yum cocktail. As my friends ordered the drinks I cannot say what it was...something like a Margarita or a Sangria type of drink. It came as strawberry flavour and mango flavour. Both were really nice and yum.Would I go back there? Yes. The atmosphere is nice and the views across Clarke Quay too :
4
Met some friends around 1:30pm and didn't leave till 5pm. We ordered food to share and jug of margarita after jug of margarita. Very refreshing especially as the weather was very muggy. Don't think the mixture was very strong with tequila as we did go through a few jugs!! A very happening place on the heart of a very vibrant part of Singapore - Clarke Quay. A must on our next visit.
4
We arrived at the restaurant at 10pm jet lagged after our flight from the UK. Realising margaritas were now half price lifted the spirits!If you are vegetarian in Singapore and have had enough noodles, curry or salad, Mexican is a great option and this a good place to try. The food was plentiful and good with a menu offering all the favourites and the staff attentive to dietary needs. Lots of options for vegetarians here. The margaritas were well mixed but probably would have been expensive at full price. One of the few places we found where you could sit outside to eat and Clarke Quay is a buzzing place even midweek. A place to people watch and relax away from the traffic. Kitchens shut at 11pm midweek. Later at weekends. We found some restaurants close early in Singapore so if you have just flown in, want to take in a light show at the SuperTrees then have s late dinner, this is a great option

Went here with my friends for cheap Margaritas (which were very good) and something to eat. The dishes were very large, tasted great (and authentic) and were not too expensive. The food came fairly fast, and it was lovely to sit outside and enjoy the view over the bay. Our waiter was... well, he seemed like he had sniffed his socks before coming to work. He justed could not get anything right - but luckily we were not in a hurry :) Would definitely come back

Perfect place for party lover. Happening crowd right at clarquay. Delicious food.
Put your finger on any item specially nachos, fajitas.
Super atmosphere, brilliant location. A must go.

I have been to cafe iguana many times for their promotional house margaritas. Personal favourite is the mango and lime. I also like their fajitas! Oh, and free flow chips and salsa. Only downside is there's no air con but I can live with that.

Lovely Setting, Stunning Views of Clarke Quay,night-time highly recommended Excellent service and food. Check-out the Tequila Slush-Puppies

Try to go at lunchtime or after 10pm to get the rock bottom prices. Busy times are also more expensive. Location is nice along the river and there is limited indoor seating in case you need AC. The food menu is just OK. Don't expect much. You came here to drink margaritas...
2
After a long session of meeting, we about 10 of us decided to have a drink and dinner at Cafe Iguana, the frozen magaritta was great, food selection though limited but OK.. not very tasty but OK.. it is pricy .. I think they can do better than tha

An odd menu with interesting - if not always successful - flourishes. For lovers of authentic Mexican food, this will be a disappointment, but this is what passes for "Mexican" food in Singapore. The portions are very generous, and best to share one mains if you have already had an appetiser. I ordered a chicken chimichanga - always a standard dish for me to rate Mexican places. While it wasn't bad, it had green bell peppers in it - one of those interesting flourishes that don't always work. The margaritas are heavily diluted and feel non-alcoholic - a problem I also had at Muchos on the other side of the river from Cafe Iguana
4
a lively and happening place just across clarke quay. very lively atmosphere with superb margharitas and great mexican food. good choice for vegetarians and good portions. but reservations are required for weekends. we had to wait for 45 mins as we didnt reserve. the staff were friendly and prompt
4
Celebrated a bday here with our group of 11 people. We are all veg and the veggie options were good, so were the potion sizes. The restaurant should extend a small gesture like a small pastry or cake for celebrations, which despite asking/ requesting them while making the booking, they said they will not do. Its just any small gesture but it makes the event more special. The nachos and margarita's were very good but the quesadillas were averag
4
Being by the river with a big drinks menu helps. The food's good for Asian tex-mex (SeÃ±or Taco over the bridge gets much closer to real rich Mexican flavours but doesn't have as good a position). the burrito's beef was pretty bland but other ingredients compensated plus the green pork stew that I got slathered over the top was seriously rich and spicy and would be my pick on its own next time. Meals are large which, along with free chips and salsa, makes up for high prices
4
It was hot and some Coronas, chips and guacamole sounded good. This restaurant has all we needed. The location on the river provided a great setting for a nice dinner. The guacamole was fresh and tasty. For dinner, we had the sea bass tacos and fajitas. We received three tacos, which were very big. The fish was excellent. I was originally going to order the chicken fajitas, but decided to ask if they could do a chicken and steak combo. I am glad I did. The chicken was ok, but the steak was delicious. We left stuffed and happy. LOL.
3
Dined here last night with friends, wasn't blown away at all. The food just lacked any real flavours. This coupled with the price made the whole thing a bit of a letdown.
4
The margaritas were excellent and when the appetiser came we were not disappointed. Delicious, large jalapeno poppers. Our main course was fajitas. Again generous portions and the food was great. The service was particularly attentive and all the staff were friendly and helpful. We will definitely go there again
4
Food comes in big portions, is reasonably priced and tastes really good. The menu seems fairly limited however all the classic mexican meals are on there. Drinks are good with the margarita jug being a favourite in our group!Cafe Iguana is located in Clarke Quay, next to the river and only a 2 minute walk to the main bar area. It is definitely worth sitting outside to make the most of the awesome location.

I heard that this was supposed to be a "good" Mexican restaurant in Singapore and decided to visit. It was a Tuesday night, didn't make a reservation and expected to wait. While waiting at the bar, it took forever to get served for a drink, only when we asked, were we served. One bar man for the entire place, he was non-stop going crazy - the place was busy. Getting a refill was even worse!!Finally we got a table and ordered dinner. The food came out in reasonable time, however it was very average. Not sure how people reviewed this as great food. I am not claiming to be an expert on Mexican food, but having lived in Southern California for years and traveled to Mexico on numerous occasions, I think I am qualified to recognize great Mexican cuisine from an "average" representation. This place is well located, great to sit outdoors in the evening and the atmosphere is decent. The service sucks and the food isn't too good either. If they could improve on that, it would be great.
5
My friend told me this place was great, so when I went for a visit we had to try it. She wasn't wrong, the sea bass enchiladas were amazing. The flavours were great, lots of good southwestern spices. We also had a shrimp dish that was ok - the sauce was a bit too sweet and not spicy enough but everything else on the plate was great. Even the salsa that came with the chips was good - salsa on this side of the world is usually horrible. Definitely worth a try
5
I ate here with my family of four (2 x adults, 12y boy and 10y girl) and we were not disappointed. Complimentary crispy corn chips and salsa were provided while we view the menu. We decided on a selection of tacos, fajitas, quesadillas and chimichangas. Some were asked to have spices toned down to meet the palates of the kids. Food service was fast, and the taste was fabulous. Highlight for me was the beef fajitas. High quality steak, cooked to a perfect medium. Added to fresh tortillas and enough salsa and condiments to jazz things up. I was in heaven
5
Been to this place so many times and it has never disappointed. Consistent quality of food, huge portions and something to suit everyone's choice.Loved the guacomole dip and the nachos is one of the best in Singapore. Margaritas balance out the flavors of the food, would prefer a tad bit more alcohol in the margaritas though.Overall one of the best places at Clarke quay for a friend's get together. Will keep coming back here for sure
5
Perfect Nachos. Chips and dips were served, even the dips were tasty. Jalapeno poppers were superb. Burritos, Enchiladas, Quesadillas all good. Very few restaurants were nothing disappoints and this is among them.Quantity for each dish is really good per serving. So better to order less dishes/ quantities. Ambience is enjoyable.Fact that I visited twice in same week just adds this restaurant high up in my list. Service is good. Will visit again, surely
4
I love taking my visitor here for dinner. The food is good quality Mexican, big portions. The location is right on the river, with the world going by. They are great with kids, taking special care to get the kids meals out quickly. The margaritas are sensational and they will happily replace your glass with a new salted glass when you are drinking jugs.They do get busy, so book. The service can be slow sometimes if they are busy, but the staff are always very nice
3
Haven't been here is an age and was so disappointed with my recent visit,The staff are great,the drinks are good so is the atmosphere but what happened to the food.?We had a selection of starters, and various main courses including chicken,veggie,meat and fish the portions are huge, but the taste was not,bland and uninspiring is a kind description.The poppers used to be one of my favourites but they were greasy and only made edible by the addition of the hot sauces
5
Never expected to find Mexican food that reminded me of home (San Diego, Ca -- where we have some of the BEST Mexican food!!) -- in Singapore, but we DID!!
3
Simple fayre, nothing outstanding. Ordered nachos to start but complimentary nachos were then provided with the drinks which wasnt explained when ordering. Main meal was okay - just the type of food you would expect from a franchise.
1
We tried 4 different dishes but no joy Bland tasteless stodgy food at top prices due to location. Service was reasonable but food terrible
4
1st time at a Mexican restaurant.
Great ambience
Loved the Shredded Steak Chimichanga
Fell in Love with the Melorita margaritas.
House Pour Pink Guava too was great.
Will head back soon to try out the rest of the menu.
5
The best mexican we found in our 4 years living in Singapore. We would always be so happy to get back there on date nights. Great strawberry margaritas and their corn chips and salsa they serve as an appetiser upon arrival is THE BEST! :) Chicken chimichungas are delicious! Great guacomole too. Great for couples, family or groups of friends but it gets a bit too loud for young kids (we tried with the kids a couple of times but they got a bit overwhelmed by it all)
5
I've been going to CafÃ© Iguana for such a long time and it never disappoints! The food is typical Mexican but toned down on the heat to please the average Joe. The Location is superb, I recommend seating outdoors, with great views from the Singapore River with the cool Clark Quay vibe. They make killer frozen margaritas served on chilled jugs. They have the option of corn tortillas for those needing a gluten-free diet, and their burritos are simply to die for. They have the regular happy hour discount, but also the late night happy hour, with 50% discount on drinks. Reservation is highly recommended especially during the weekend
4
Love this place, fourth visit in two years, only because we live so far away and only visited Singapore twice. Great little afternoon bar to drop into. Good drinks list and complimentary corn chips and salsa dip makes it a comfortably pleasant sundowner highlight. Stay a bit longer and enjoy a fulfilling dinner full of Mexican spices. The staff are lovely and even under the pump always friendly and accommodating. They are not too precious about seating you in a 'reserved area' ie smoking.... And let you know when the guests are expected so you can choose to move or move on. We chose to be relocated and enjoy the meal and ambience. Special mention to Jessie, a top waitperson, who remembered us from 2 years ago and made us so welcome. What a memory she has for us visitors never lone the many locals she serves every day. We WIILL BE BACK! Probably in 2 years :-) Thanks guys for making our Singapore moments memorable
5
Located along Clarke Quay, Cafe Iguana is not to be missed. The food is high quality Mexican - right up there with SoCal Mexican food. The portions are huge! The atmosphere is so beautiful and relaxing. Right on the water with the night life across the river. Go at night and enjoy the beautiful lights of Clarke Quay
4
The last time we came here was in 2004, and we are happy to say that the food exceeded our expectations. We had a New York steak, for the 8 year old, Chimichanga's for my wife and I, both steak and chicken and a steak Fajitas for our friend! The steak for bothe the New York Steak and Fajitas was lean and very tasty, especially if you like it cooked medium. It was a great day to eat outside, weather was cool and the restaurant ambiance was pretty good. The service staff were attentive, without being over bearing, and professional. The drinks were well priced for Singapore. Even though we used two Entertainment Guide for Singapore vouchers the meal still would have been quite reasonable. A very enjoyable experience.
3
I guess the food here can best be described as the sort that would a travelling American happy? Less cerviche and re fried beans, more nachos and commercial cheddar. If you're into that kind of food, with beer and so-so margaritas, coupled with efficient service, then yes, it's not too bad a place. But because it's along the Singapore river, in the Clarke Quay area, be prepared to pay tourist prices.
3
Good Mexican food. comes in big portion that for some ladies..that would do for 2 meals.
0ffer margarita half price..but need to be after 10 pm.
5
Really enjoyed the authentic Mexican food, craft beer and good service. Real guacamole and excellent salsa, not easy to find in Asia!
5
I have been going here for years, always a good cheap meal and great margaritas with a nice view, good service and atmosphere!
4
Great place to have nachos and maragritas. Next to the magaritas you should try the Mars bar shots, like a chocolate custard (Mars taste) with tequilla, they are strong, good and I think they may be addictive :-)
5
I've visited multiple areas in Mexico and the US, were Mexican food is very prevalent and popular.Having tried a handful of Mexican restaurants in Singapore, none of them were particularly good.Cafe Iguana serves up delicious, relatively healthy food, with pretty reasonable prices (~$20-26 per main course).I highly recommend the chicken chimichangas, and they serve the best mango margarita I've had anywhere.Despite being cheap during happy hour, their house tequila is actually good quality, so it's an absolute bargain at $28 for a jug of five+ servings (as of 30/01/2016)
5
I always go to Cafe Iguana when I'm in Singapore, because sitting alongside the river in Clarke Quay while sipping a cold drink and eating pork tacos is simply the best. The night life of Clarke Quay sits across the river and you can enjoy the excellent Mexican food while removed from that chaos. I recommend the Pork Tacos, the Chili Con Queso, and the Taco Salad.
4
We came here quite late - to be honest we arrived in Singapore late at night, checked in to the hotel nearby, and for some reason wanted a quick cocktail around midnight before bed, as we weren't quite ready to sleep. This place is opposite the more crowded parts of Clarke Quay and that was perfect for us.This place had a nice cocktail list and we had a couple of different margaritas. Service was good, although we didn't stay long
5
The shredded beef tacos are excellent. I highly recommend them. The tortillas are handmade from masa flour and are thicker than you get in the States. The meat filling is plentiful and deliciously seasoned. These tacos are heavenly. I stopped drinking mixed drinks in Singapore because they are so weak and expensive but Cafe Iguana serves excellent margaritas whose tequila you can taste. Great cocktails. Delicious, first rate food. Very pleasant staff. The restaurant itself isn't anything special though it does has some fun art on the walls, and the outdoor seating is a bit rustic but this place is so worth the hour or two you will spend here. I can't wait to return
5
Called in here on New Years Eve it was 4.30 and pouring down so we called in for a quick snack and margarita. Cocktails were brilliant as good as any margarita I have ever had, and the bean dip was definitely THE best bean dip I have tasted....... by some distance. Service was good, ambience was too. Great food, cocktails and music. Loved it.
5
If you love margaritas, then this is the place to be! Cafe Iguana makes deliciously smooth frozen margaritas and their happy hour prices are pretty good too! I've tried most of their flavors and have not been disappointed.The food is good as well...big portions and tasty. The restaurant is located by the river side and makes for a great setting be it day or night
3
Good size portion of food, tasty and filling, more food in the main than I could finish. Was able to enjoy the views, whilst absorbing a good atmosphere outside.
1
The salsa was good but slightly sweet not at all hot. The house margaritas were decent but not the best I've had. The food was definitely sub par though. I don't think I will be going back.
5
Always a great place to hang out at Cafe Iguana, friendly staff and great food and drinks..try their massive tequila collection..
4
The reservations were handled well and we got a seat close to riverside. The service was pretty good.We ordered prawns for starters, shredded beef taco and 1/2 chicken for mains. The portions were large and we regretted ordering an extra dish! The taste was good but the price was on a higher side (20-30$ per dish)
4
This is a very good place to have mexican food in Singapore. Mexican food is not that common in Singapore currently but this restaurant serves it well. The food portion is big and sometimes can be shared by 2. Tortilla chips with salsa are served while waiting for your order. They server beers that are not usually available outside
3
The portion size has shrunk significantly since previous visit.Chips/Dips â€“ ratio is incorrect. Nowhere near enough salsa/guacamole for amount of chipsMains used to have rice or salad but now just get enchilada or quesadilla etc Prices not reduced to match reduced portionsGood food and service thoug
4
fantastic ambiance, good outdoor seating, quick service, value for money are some of the plus points of Cafe Iguana. The food we ordered was great, served quick and hot, spicy and a great accompaniment for the Margarita! the tables fill up fast in the evenings and it would be better to occupy a table and order in case waiting for others to join. A wide variety is available for vegetarians
5
Me and my 7 friends went there a Friday night without a reservation. They told us that it would take 30-45 minutes to get a table but we really wanted to try this place so we waited. After 10 minutes we got our table next to the river. The menu had at least one vegetarian option of all the different tacos and the prizes was around 20-30 dollar. The staff was helpful and we got the food really fast even though it was a full restaurant. This place is really worth a visit!
4
Scenario: dinner for 2 couples, one visiting Singapore. 2 vegetarians. Iguana made great sense - eat here every few months! Table on the patio, watching the traffic on the Singapore river and all the Citi-workers scrambling to relax on a Friday evening ...Mix of starters, for sharing. Went down well with cold beers and colder margaritas.Good selection of mains catering for all sorts of fancies. Large portions and food is decent! And good attentive service, even on a busy Friday evening
3
I simply cannot bring myself to rate this restaurant higher than a three due to the extremely large portions. My boyfriend and I ordered one main each and even one between the two of us would have been too much.The food tasted nice and their service was good, however the food stopped tasting good because there was just too much of it. This isn't somewhere I would return to.Do yourself and your health a favour and get a meal to share, you'll enjoy it a whole lot more
5
Fast and good mexican food, walking distance from Clarke Quay at good prices. Craft beer on tap. Service is pretty good. Comfort food.
4
Great ambience, very tasty Mexican food and great margarita to accompany it. Service is very nice although on busy nights it can get hard to get hold of the waiters.
5
Café iguana is in a very scenic location along the river in the heart of Clarke Quay. With a Mexican menu hat gets the taste buds tingling and some nice microbrews from the nearby Brewerkz specially designed for Café Iguana. You can sit outside or under the cover of the open restaurant/bar area.  The food is generous in terms of portion size and quite tasty. You can sit back, relax and enjoy the surroundings whilst you eat. The river is always bright with well lit up boats coming and going and the walk along the river always flowing with people walking by or heading to another bar or restaurant in the area.  We can recommend any of the standard tex-mex dishes, nachos, fajitas, quesadillas and burrito, all were excellent and mouth watering dishes. Prices were quite reasonable for the area and the staff were all very friendly and helpful
5
Always consistent food and beverage. One of my favourite Mexican restruants anywhere. The margaritas are excellent with a wide range of Tequilas available. The food is always consistently good, our favourite is the Faitas. Try and make it for happy hour especially if buying Margies by the ju
4
Husband and I went for a night cap at Cafe Iguana. As my through was parched, I asked for a virgin margarita to start with. The lime non-alcoholic margarita was thirst quenching. I loved it. The jug of Patron Margarita on the rocks we had was very nice too. We were served a bowl of chips and salsa as bar snacks. Loved the fact that the restaurant location was on Riverside Point, on the quieter part of Clarke Quay. Lovely serene section of the Singapore River. Extra point for the place being a non-smoking establishment
2
Clarke Quay Singapore caters for mass market tourism. That's no excuse for but probably explains the lack of customer service at this restaurant. There are plenty of people around so we don't need to try. With the exception of one young woman who seemed to be doing most of the work the rest of the staff were rude and unhelpful. It sells acceptable lowest common denominator Mexican food - chimichangas, fajitas, burritos etc etc. with no discernible spice but very filling so good food for drinking with. The food wasn't terrible just not very good and like everything else in Singapore very expensive. It's pricey pub grub basically in a nice enough setting by the river.
1
We've lived in Singapore now for almost 7 years and this restaurant has been a location we have visited on many occasions on the Singapore River. The setting outdoor is fantastic on a warm, clear night and it makes for a nice night...usually.We visited the restaurant again just yesterday with a group of friends for the special occasion of another friend from our expat community in town for the week.Suffice to say, we won't be going back to a once trusted location. The service was appalling, disinterested and fairly typical of many eating establishments in Singapore. They just don't 'get' service.The server attempted to tell us that he would have to charge us for the bowl of corn chips and salsa...that is despite us being onto our fourth jug of margarita, finally finishing the night with 5 jugs ($200) and a further $250 of food for the party of 6. Fortunately some stern words about the choice we have here (next door is Harry, Brewerkz etc.) and they saw the light.Food is really not great. A taco salad that is 80% green lettuce does not represent good value at any restaurant. There are much better options and when the bill comes to $450, you expect good service, good food and attentive staff. We got none of these and unfortunately this is the last time we venture to Cafe Iguana in Singapore. There are better options for Mexican style food and tapas.Do yourself a favour and cross this one off your list
4
Love this place & visit here every time we go to Singapore. Surprised it's still there by Singapore standards as things move so fast in Singapore. They make a great margarita & the Mexican food is yum. A great place to watch people walking along Clake Quay
3
Had early dinner here last night with family and overall had a good experience. The complimentary corn crisps and salsa are always good, but having eaten here a few times before, I was disappointed with the steak burrito, the filling of which was too dry although flavorful; others enjoyed their steak and chicken fajitas. Chicken wings were flavorful and spicy; but like some other reviewers, I am sure the frozen margaritas used to be more frozen and a lot more flavorful previously. The setting on the riverside is lovely, the service is efficient, but given the price and without the drawcard of what used to be fabulous margaritas, Cafe Iguana is losing its appeal..
4
It's my second time at Cafe Iguana last night. This time we decided to really stay and have dinner. We just had their awesome margaritas the last time.I was really hungry from the flight to Manila so I had a tough tine choosing from Cafe Iguana's menu. We had shortlisted from appetizers, fajitas and tequila grill selections. Finally, we decided to order their cheese and mushroom quesadilla which was totaly wonderful! He had a half chicken amd I chose the New York steak from the Tequila Grill. He loved his chicken and although my steak could be a lttle bit more tender, I still enjoyed and finished the whole thing. I guess I should've stayed with how I would normally have my steak done, mediu, not medium-well.Their strawberry margaritas are super delicious! Their classic lime too. To me, it's how margaritas should basically taste, simple, not too overpowering, beautiful.We've decided that on our next visit. We'll try their fajitas. It smelled so good from the next table!:
4
Nice place with vers decent food. Service was very friendly and helpful in advising what to eat. Prices were reasonable and the view was great
4
It happened to visit with my friend during week days. We had a good food and ambience is good if your sitting riverside. Love the blueberry margarita. They have good options of vegetarian food. The price is moderate compare to other restaurant in that location.
4
Food, service and ambience is amazing! May be a little overpriced! Amazing place to hang out with friends!
3
Decent spot if you're looking for somewhere to have a relaxed Mexican meal with friends. The cafe overlooks Clarke Quay and has a good atmosphere. Despite being very busy, the service was very good and prompt with all staff being polite and friendly. The food was fresh and good, particularly the Prawn Fajitas and others recommended the Red Snapper Burritos. However, I would say that this is a little on the expensive side for what you get and wasn't anything special
5
Oh the burrito is so much filling and yummy that I keep on going there again and again. .The overlooking Clark quay lites and hush bush makes the food more tasty. .u can expect a slow service when the place is crowded. .and yah it's always crowded. .so better book a table .
3
A group of 10 family and friends went to Cafe Iguana for lunch last Sunday. Whilst the company was great the service and food was disappointing. The "greeting" was made by an unhappy and grumpy woman who should have been sent home the minute she arrived. The table she offered us was not to our liking and when we requested another in a better position it seemed all too hard for her, though we did get what we wanted in the end. Fortunately this woman disappeared and the waiter was helpful and more pleasant. The lime margaritas were as great as ever but those of us who had the chicken fajitas found the chicken dry and tasteless. Maybe left over for. Saturday night? We will think twice before we return as there are many places along the river worth a try
1
Food was OK but Margaritas very weak! We used 3 'entertainer' discount vouchers for the food, they brought us the bill and we paid. But then... They returned to demand we pay extra saying the vouchers were not valid as we were charged happy hour prices for the drinks (despite the fact they had already given us the discount on the previous bill and we had paid)! In 2 years of using 'entertainer' vouchers I have never been refused a discount on the food due to getting happy hour price drinks. Unfortunately one of our party paid before I was unable to interveneOverall a very poor experience for my Birthday
2
My husband and I are regular guests at Iguana's, and not the least because of their margaritas. Their food menu is just OK, but their margaritas are killer and we would would usually get a jug, or two! We had not been for a few months and recently went back. We asked for a cooler for the jug but we were told (by new personnel?) that they were not allowed to provide any ice coolers "by management" any more. I guess new management as we would always get a cooler to keep the margarita from melting fast. But the most disappointing of all, was that our well beloved drink had become tasteless! I blamed a bad badge. Tonight I went back, to give it another try. But not so. My again tasteless glass of frozen margarita even came without anything frozen in it. Something has changed at Iguana's and it ain't good. I won't be back any time soon

Been passing by Cafe Iguana and wondering about its food, since I do enjoy having Mexican food. Finally decided to give it a try last week.Appetisers graced the table one by one - beginning with this Puerco En Chile Verde - simply spicy pork stew served over rice, with flour tortillas and dollop of sour cream. Deliciously spicy, with a distinctively-familar flavour (akin to that of the Chinese braised red braised pork ribs, IMO) and utterly succulent, this pork stew vertebrates in the mouth, leaving it tingly till one tucks in with the tasty rice or flour tortillas for balance. For that, it became my favorite dish of the night.Camarones al Diablo (SGD$23.00) - prawns sauteed with fiery habanero chile, capsicum, ginger, cumin and lime, served with mushrooms, cheese and poblano quesadillas. This dish was a combination of two of my favorite items, juicy prawns bursting with tangy flavour upon contact with teeth. Pairing this with soft, chewy quesadilla sheets filled with cheesy mushrooms and poblano pepper, was unspeakably blissful as the textures and flavours frolicked in the mouth, becoming a tasteful sensation.Then the mains came onboard, first in the form of Tequila Grilled Half-chicken (SGD$38.00) - lime marinated and finished with a smoky and spicy tequila glaze, served with grilled vegetables and poblano-scalloped potatoes. The well-slicked outer appearance of this chicken belied the surprisingly tender flesh within, revelling in its tasty lime-marinated state fluttering gently amidst the spicier overtures.Dessert was the Ancho Chile Chocolate Cake (SGD$14.00), also known as the flourless cake, made completely of cocoa powder and served with margarita sauce and vanilla ice-cream. Not hard to see why this was my favorite dessert of the night - the chocolate cake held a firm, solid texture in lieu of the fluffiness of flour-baked cakes. It was resplendent of a beautiful chocolatey flavour, not too sweet, and melting easily in the mouths like a dream.What's a Mexican meal without Churros? Well, here we have it - Churros (SGD$12.00), served with sweet cinnamon powder, chocolate sauce and vanilla bean ice-cream. The golden crisps of the churros break apart beautifully with each bite, dissolving slowly in the mouth in a saccharine flow of flavours; heightened further when eaten with the vanilla-bean ice-cream.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/media-invite-dinner-at-cafe-iguane.htm

This is my 3rd visit here whilst I've been in Singapore. On each occasion I have had the Burrito. It is loaded full & very tasty. The chips & salsa are complimentary and very tasty when accompanied by a cool Corona or Margarita. Will definitely visit again when next in Singapore
4
This was our third visit. Could not fault the service or food. The alcohol gets more expensive the later it gets- so get in early for cheap(er) drinks. Service friendly and quick.
4
wonderful ambiance and delicious mexican food..
Ideal for both family and couples..
Advance booking suggested in case you are a fan of al fresco setting.
5
I used to come to this restaurant every few months when I lived in Indonesia. They have excellent steak tacos. It is located right on the water at Clark Quay, and the river view is nice. You can sit there and watch boats go by, not to mention an excellent variety of people walking by. The cocktails are served nice and strong, and there is a graduated Happy Hour. Depending what time it is, the beers are priced different, steadily getting more expensive every hour or so. Go for an early dinner to get the best drink prices! This is always one of my favorite spots to stop when I am in Singapore. There are many things to do in that little area
4
we were here early in the evening and it was drizzling. So no one was sitting outside because the table and chairs were wet. We decided to just order a few and have dinner some place else while waiting for the rain to stop. We got the cheese, mushroom and bacon quesadilla, churros and iced coffee and lime juice all of which were great by the way. The wait staff was very friendly, making to ask my daughter how she liked the quesadilla, tacos and churros. The cafe was right next to the river which added to the ambience. Clark quay is mostly a night spot where friends meet to drink. We were with a child that's why we left early before the place was packed with people wanting a drink or two. It was one of the places on our checklist which we made sure to visit during our trip to Singapore
3
We went here and placed our order. Their staff was hard to understand and apparently they didn't understand us. Because they only delivered us 1 main course? So we shared that plate and had to order a second main course... To share obviously. But what is important... It tasted great!
2
This cafe benefits from a prime location on the Singapore river. I've been drinking there for years and enjoying the cocktails and riverside ambiance. Tonight I made the mistake of eating there. The burritos we were served arrived suspiciously quickly, and sure enough, seemed to have been made some hours previously and inadequately reheated. I could have found better food in 7-11 for a tenth of the price. Please try harder

Visited this restaurant a couple weeks ago with my boyfriend. We ordered the deep fried chimichanga (beef) and soft shell tacos (red snapper) to share. They were both very delicious, huge portion sizes, plus all you can eat chips and salsa! service was good especially for being at Clarke quay. We were both impressed and will definitely be returning
3
Went for dinner here with the family on a Saturday night. Couldn't make reservations as they only allow reservations until 7pm. Beyond that you would have to walk in. So we took a chance and luckily it wasn't packed and we got a table immediately.Had the fried calamari, nachos and wings starters and the pork carnitas soft taco, chimichanga and enchilada for the kids. Also tried the classic margarita and a lychee gin benerage.The food was average - nothing to shout about. I was hoping for deeper mexican flavours with the use of mexican chilles but was disappointed.The sauce for the wings had not complexity - just a standard hot wings sauce (we asked hot spicy and it wasn't and we had to add in the supplied bottled hot sauces)The chimichanga and enchilada were the kids portion so it was ok. The carnitas in the soft taco's was not tender and melt in your mouth - it tasted as if it was deep fried (or re-heated) and certainly didn't taste slow cooked. We didn't finish the food and decided to skip desert.The margarita was nice - nothing special.Service was also average seeing that the place was not packed.Basically the food tasted like you would get at a Chilli's chain.Pricing wise it was a little higher than average for the quality of the food

We went there for my daughters birthday. The service is friendly and efficient. The food is consistantly good . They have happy hour specials along with free corn chips and salsa which is a good touch . Other than one time on most of our visits the food is great. It is best to sit outside on the cooler evenings. They have fantastic Burritos
4
We ate here twice whilst in Singapore. The first time we were returning late from the Night Safari at the zoo and it was virtually empty but they kindly agreed to cook for us. I had fajitas with Portabello mushrooms and my husband had the same with prawns - both were perfectly cooked and delicious.Our only complaint would be the rising price of beer as the evenings progress - we paid about Â£20 for a jug of beer [about 2.25 pints] The next night we returned [ it was my birthday] and it was virtually full... We both ate burritos but they were not completely cooked so perhaps busy times do not show the restaurant at its bes
4
We go to a Cafe Iguana every time we visit Sjngapore. Food and drinks not as good when it's so busy that the staff are overwhelmed, but usually this is not the case, and then it's fantastic.
4
We had an enjoyable meal here sitting outside enjoying the view of Clarke Quay. The meal sizes are generous and made from fresh ingredients. Price is average. We thought Margaritas were a little on the small side but overall enjoyed it.
4
An all time favorite. The food is great. The habanero sauce made up in punch what the drink (Virgin Mary) lacked. The cheese loaded nachos are the best I have had. My recommendation would be to go there more for the food.
4
Great place for Mexican food. if you don't get a table, give your phone number and go around Clark quay and take in the sights. They will call you when the table is available.
5
The Nachos are the best ever!! The river view is wonderful. Don't miss this place on your visit to Singapore. Call ahead for a reservation because it fills up.
4
Nice music at the background, just by the seaside, and good food! We ordered nachos, chimmichangas which were quite heavy. Prawn options are usually smelly and not reccomended! Check out for the premium margeritas, quite good here!
4
Cafe Iguana has evolved into an institution in Singapore. It's right there on the river just across from Clark Quay, and certainly on the better side of the river. The margaritas, even the house pours, are perfect for a quiet drink and a chat with old friends and new. The food is consistently good. All your Tex Mex favourites. Ok this isnt Texas, but taking that into account its always good and for Singapore the prices are good. Best advice, get there early to get one of the high tables inside and settle in for a long night. Pace yourself and take advantage of the happy hours and specials as the night rolls on. Then dont look at the bill until the next day, just pay it..

This Mexican place at Riverside Point across from Clarke Quay is a very good spot to relax with dinner and a view. The ambiance is relaxed, the service is good and the food is tasty. The prices are also in line with expectations.I wanted a spot for dinner that was not far from my hotel. I searched a bit around Clarke Quay and Riverside Point and found CafÃ© Iguana to be the most attractive option. I decided to try this restaurant in spite of the fact that I was skeptical about the quality of a Mexican establishment half way around the world from its namesake land.I walked in and was greeted quickly. I decided to sit at the bar as I was on my own and it was empty at the time. I was served by the bartender who was a very personable and friendly gentleman who took good care of me.It was clear that many people came here for the Tequila and the bar bites. However, the menu was also attractive. It was Mexican in orientation but there was also a little creativity in play as well. I started with the chicken taco salad. To my satisfaction, this was a smaller salad with no edible shell that served as a nice starter plate. For my main, I had an item that was a Christmas special and sounded intriguing...the Turkey and Cranberry Burrito. It included some other veggies as well as black beans. It was actually quite tasty.The price was a little steep though not awful. Including the drink, tax, service charge and a small extra tip, the total was $61 SGD. At the exchange rates at the time, this equated to $46 USD. While this was a little excessive for what I got, in my opinion, I also realize I was paying partly for location.Overall, this place was a pretty good spot for Mexican fare. The menu was a bit creative offering good food. The ambiance was quite nice and the service is also very good. The prices are a bit expensive but were not out of line. It is worth a try if you enjoy this type of fare

We ate here on our first night in Singapore and had a really great meal. Large portion sizes, good flavours, lots of fresh vegetables. We had tacos and enchiladas and were both very impressed with our meals. Nice location near Clarke Quay. We also had fantastic service from our waitress.Note we also ate at Muchos mexican restaurant in Clarke Quay a few days later and had a miserable meal there at similar prices - avoid Muchos, go to Iguana instead
2
I went to cafe iguana with my family. Being a vegetarian there was only one option 'roasted pumpkin'. I ordered it in chimichanga. It was a dish with no taste. All the sauces provided were supermarket bottled. Inspite of this very expensive. Views were good. Drinks were ok. We left 3/4 food that we ordered. No one even bothered to ask if there was something wrong. Def not going back.
4
Good food, don't order nachos for starters....you get some free anyway. The chimmichanga was immense. Not cheap but then what is out here.
3
Clark quay is a fun area that attracts alot of people. If you're looking to have a good time and you want Mexican then I would recommend. However, if you want amazing Mexican food, I'm not sure this is the best place. With that said, this is singapore and it's not known for Mexican so this might be the best relative to the city. We ordered the burrito and the chimichonga
2
There Margaritas are to die for...I had my usual traditional lime which was just perfect..while my husband ordered the pink guava flavor...which was too sweet for my taste buds...the quesadillas were a great appetizer..oh then I just noticed the interiors...what a blend of colors on the walls...u can't miss a large..very large painting of a lady..which is crowned by a big green color lizard...the service was not that friendly...but for food it's a great Mexican outlet and the riverside view adds up
5
If you love Mexican food, this is the place to go to. I adore Chimichangas, and so of course, this is what I ordered. First of all, the portion size is HUGE. I could only eat half, which meant I had some for later too! Yea! It was served piping hot, and was seasoned perfectly. Couldn't have been better. My husband and kids all enjoyed their meals as well, ( Fajitias, snapper, and tacos) and we all enjoyed the free nachos and sauce. The portions were oversized for everyone, so you get your moneys worth. It's a very busy restaurant, so do plan to come early or call ahead for reservations!The atmosphere on and around Clarke Quay is fun and vibrant, and if you are a people watcher, then you'll really enjoy watching the tourists and the locals mix. After dinner you can enjoy a bum boat ride on the Singapore river, or just stroll along the river walk
4
I had a yearning for Tex-Mex food so I Googled and found good reviews at TripAdvisor so we decided to try it. For appetizer , we ordered a large Nachos and Taco salad with chicken for 6 of us to share. The Nachos is delicious! It's loaded with lots of cheese and the ingredients are fresh. So is the Taco salad. The dressing is tangy and spicy. In fact, I found the condiments are tasty and fresh. The salsa is not too spicy and the guacamole complements the Nachos well. The burritos and chimichangas were huge and I noticed many diners ordered these. I shared the chicken fajitas with my hubby. The chicken is too dry but well seasoned. I was too stuffed to eat the tortillas so I can't say how it taste. But hubby said the fajitas is good. He shared a soft beef tacos and said it's delicious too. We were stuffed by the end of the meal but decided to order a dessert to share and we chose churros. It was served with ice cream. I find the churros a bit oily and the ice cream not cold enough as some had melted. But my kids still finished it.There were lots of diners as our meal progresses and the restaurant were almost full. So do make a reservation if you plan to dine late
5
I go to Cafe Iguana every time I am in Singapore - 4 times a year for the last 15 years. A friend told me it was sliding downhill, so I went with some trepidation on my last visit. For my good fortune, the food is as good as ever, the Margaritas are stronger than ever - and the service is just as good. The table / stool/ bar arrangement inside is a fun alternative to the tables outside.The view of the Quay is great.And the best - the restaurant has been named 'Ambassador of Tequila' by the Mexican Embassy. Great variety of tequilas
5
The food here is excellent, and it would be the best Mexican food I've had, and that's a pretty big call. The Fajitas and Enchiladas, which was all we tried from the menu, are nicely served and very tasty. Six of us lunched together and the food all came out together, which is always a pleasant surprise. The mains are served with plenty of vegetables and the guacamole is worth a mention, too. We drank delicious margaritas, so good that they should be ordered by the jug! The staff are welcoming, attentive and very pleasant, something not always present in Singapore! A must for lunch or dinner in a compulsory walk along the river
4
Every time we visit Singapore this place is on our must do list mainly because of the jugs of Frozen Margaritas which are delicious. The food is nice too and the setting is great especially the tables out the front with a view of the river and quayside
4
Good food, large portions sizes but not cheapChilli symbol on menu doesnâ€™t seem to match hotness of food.Started was very mild yet had chilli sign, main was too hot and no chilli sign!Good mocktailsStaff attentive and helpful, better than most in Singapor
4
This is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Singapore. The portion sizes are good and the happy hours are well placed also. The themed interior is really nice as I am a art teacher and really like the Frida Kahlo style. The option to eat in or out is nice. My family used to come here for our children's birthday. They really like the chocolate icecream and the corn crisps on top. We have always had great service. I recommend the Chicken Chimichanga. Also as it has a great drinks menu, thise who like beer have a great selection and those who like margaritas are happy also.I have also taken many business dinners here which is well located on the river for guests to see the boats go by
4
Had dinner 2 adults and 1 child. Great selection of dishes on the menu. Friendly and efficient staff. Location at Clarke Quay is lovely.
4
We ate with our 2 kids. It was a nice change from everything else we've eaten in singapore. We had a good waitress. Food was delicious, just a tad spicy for my kids though.
4
The flat white coffee served with cheesecake and muffins were very nice to eat. The environment is clean and price are cheap and good value for money
4
The best Tex-Mex joint in this part of the world. Their Frozen Margaritas are something of a legend - stong, boozy and fruity - all at the same time! Also another plus is the fact that you can order beer from breworkz as well!as with everywhere in Singapore, a bit pricey but must visit
2
How do you go from a really good almost traditional mexican food restaurant to terrible tex-mex food in six months?! Cafe Iguana must have changed hands since our last visit as there was nothing traditional and it really wasn't even that tasty. The biggest concern is that the "corn" chips and tortillas are actually made of a mixture of corn and wheat flour... Why? I do not know but they don't taste great and as I am gluten intolerant I could not eat these. Total false advertising.If you have never been to Mexico and like westernised mexican food you may like Cafe Iguana but unfortunately it no longer will be a destination for me.
5
I had a fantastic bean/veggie salad and an equally fantastic margarita. The setting is nice in Clarke Quay. They are always busy, but the staff is always right there, efficient. SGD 20 is expensive for a salad, but that's typical of non-hawker stand Singapore dining out.
4
I've been here countless times, everytime with a failed attempt to visit other bars/pubs. Compared to the other places around Clark Quay, cafe iguana is perpetually crowded but has a very large and open space, so it feels just right.I ain't sure about the food, but we always have frozen margaritas! Prices are good, too, depending on what time you are there. The BEST I've ever had. Very nice place to catch up and have a chat
4
Located at Clarke Quay, this place has a lovely feel with its outside seating. A friend and I reached this restaurant late evening and luckily it was pretty empty. The frozen margaritas are delicious (gulp them down fast if you aim for a brain freeze!) The service is good and prompt. Would definitely go back the next time I'm in Singapore.
5
Its good place if you want to chill with your friends, dating or just single visited. Their margaritas can come based on our request in frozen or in the rock with many taste variance. Love their tortilla chips, and chicken quesadilla. If you sit outdoor, so you can see the river view. This place is very strategic in the middle of Singapore river side point
4
The place is right in the middle of CQ, being a first timer I did not have much expectation from the place for veg food. But what I ordered was pretty delicious, the portions were enough for one, service was nice, beer options were fine. To top it all the view was perfect from that place to enjoy the dinner. Will not mind visiting it again
4
Prime location, nice food and good service. I've been here many times and have never been disappointed till date. Decent selection of beers and margaritas, tasty food with reasonable wait times.
Recommended!
4
This is one of my favorite restaurants to visit over the weekend for a really good and casual Mexican dinner. Beef fajita is my personal favorite but any other dishes are equivalently delicious!
4
You can dine in or go al fresco, by the river walks, it is in a food street opposite Clark Quay, next to Merchant Court Hotel. The Restaurant serves Mexican food, I went there with my family , the food is nice, portions are quite big. Service is good, free nachos all nite...
4
Lovely ambience and location - right in the middle of Clarks Quay ! The service was excellent with a smile and that made it a good visit. I liked the décor in particular with an excellent rendition of Frida Kahlo's self portrait with monkey, here replaced by an iguana! The artist I hear is Willy Baet from California. The frozen margaritas are a favourite here. The food is very good aswell. My friends in Singapore are regulars here and swear by the cocktails and the café's food. The ambience is relaxed and casual. The décor is chic and very thematic. Must try for lovers of good food and quirky ambience
5
Always here for some good tequila and margarita. Never fail to entertain my friends when in this place. The food is good and so is the service. The bartenders are friendly too. I would recommend to give it a try when you are near to Clarke Quay or Riverside Walk. Try different kind of Tequila and it will open up your concept of Tequila. Ask the bartender for recommendation
4
Visited Cafe Iguana twice in the past 2 weeks and think it is consistent and good value for a meal in a central location.The manager could do with being more friendly and customer-focused (twice we came with a baby and pram and he grimaced at trying to accommodate us though got there in the end), however his staff, in particular two men (both young, slim, one with glasses) are fantastic and we've tipped heavily in support of them. They were quick, helpful (i.e. providing hot water to reheat baby's milk) and polite.I had the veggie enchilada with the dark beer and white wine. Very tasty and both times couldn't manage the portion size. Husband had chicken fajitas once and meat enchilada, both times decent. Only criticism was the inflexibility over substituting sour cream for more guacamole which they wouldn't do.Would definitely come back for a Mexican food craving
4
Really enjoyed this meal while in Singapore. It gets pretty full- as do all of the eateries in Clarke Quay- in the evenings. I had the roasted pumpkin soft tacos, which were perfect. My husband ordered the Chicarrón Burrito and did not enjoy it as much- he gave it an 'average'. The menu had several veggie options. Also enjoyed the house made habanero hot sauce. The chips were much lighter than the 'typical' Tex-Mex style (i.e. less greasy.) The drink list included a variety of the cocktails you would expect, in addition to a couple of alcohol free cocktails
4
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I never fail to take visiting friends over. The food is delicious - the highlights for me are their Guacamole, which is always fresh and well seasoned, the Burrito Bowl, which has lovely flavours and all my favourite Mexican add-ons, and the Jalapeno-Cheese sticks, which were unfortunately a temporary menu item! A couple of improvements: Their Chocolate Shots are amazing but the rest of their cocktails are very average and not worth the price you pay. The vegetarian options are limited and currently, full of pumpkin, which is not ideal. However, they are very receptive to feedback and one of their managers actually emailed me after I filled-in the feedback form, which increases their credibility for me
4
Eating here can get expensive. Unless you plan ahead. I did and it was awesome. Margaritas on weekends are cheapest between 12pm-3pm and progressively get more and more expensive as evening approaches. So go for lunch if you want to save money on drinks. Great view of the river. Friendly staff, but they look slightly overworked.Food's great, optimum serving size. Must go if you are looking for Mexican food in Singapore! There are so few of this and this is on the top of the list for me
4
Large portions (mainly) which meant that we should have listened to our waitress, who told us we'd ordered too much! Still, they will always prepare a 'doggie bag'.Ask for an outdoor table - they're covered so even if its raining, you'll get the view but you won't get wet
4
good mojitos good steak good al fresco dining ..good value for money. They gave roses to ladies on valentines day but only on asking ..:(
3
Had the Fajitas (we're regulars and have been enjoying this dish for some time) and it really disappointed. Tortillas are smaller, meat is dry.... I hope they come back up to standard because it's a favorite
4
Right on the water, delicious fajitas in the openair admidst the twinkling lights of night time Singapore

I was one of the earliest patrons of this restaurant when it was opened years ago by the guys who had started Brewerkz. Back then, it was rarely crowded, the staff really engaged with customers, and management clearly cared about the product and experience they were offering. Recently visited Singapore and of course went back to CafÃ© Iguana.....what a disappointment. One of the owners I met years ago used to take great pride in their tequila offering and the quality of their cocktails......now the ruthless commercialism which has come to Singapore with casinos and F-1 has pervaded this place too. I tried to order a margarita specifying a particular tequila.....you would have thought I was negotiating nuclear disarmament. The bartender then asked if I wanted the drink made with a 30ml pour or 45ml....to which I replied "which is the standard pour for a proper margarita recipe?" This has gone from a place which took pride in its product to a place attempting to gouge for every nickel they can get......hugely disappointing
5
What a fantastic little restaurant! We stopped by Clarke Quay for a bite to eat when we stayed in Singapore. We came upon this place as it just stood out with its vibrant atmosphere. We were told that we might have to wait approx 30mins for a table for two, so we went to have a drink at the bar. We were still in time for Happy Hour with a couple of minutes to spare which was great. Within a few mins of getting our drinks, the host came over as a table had come free. More drinks were ordered and the waiter explained that Happy Hour was over. We knew this but it was kind of him to mention it. He also did a great upsell on a better quality margarita with pink guava which I was glad he did as it was simply delicious. The food was fantastic too...portions were huge, so I would recommend considering how big your appetite is. My husband & I ordered one starter with two main courses and couldn't finish everything. Prices were good at around $120 for two people with several beers and cocktails. Will go back here on my next visit.
4
Wandered in here on our first night in Singapore after a big day getting here. It looked pretty busy and it was 9 at night, which if we were at home in Perth, we would get laughed out the door expecting a meal at that time. Within a minute the guy had us seated at a table that appeared to come out of thin air and we were sharing a big plate of nachos in no time. The nachos were tasty and quite filling but light at the same time. Would happily eat here again
4
The menu was simple but with nice choices on it, the food was tasty and well presented and arrived really quickly after ordering. The frozen marguerita was superb and the tortilla chips really good. Beware there is a lot of raw onion in the food though
5
If you ever spend some time living abroad (anyplace far from where you were born) you figure out how hard it is to get an authentic taste. Recipes abound these days and supermarkets are seemingly stuffed with anything a chef might desire. But getting ingredients and following instructions doesn't get you anywhere close to home cooking. That's why Europe is full of poor Mexican restaurants. Asia too, for that matter. On arrival at Cafe Iguana, I'd added to my usual skepticism an upset stomach. So imagine my surprise when the rave reviews seemed to be fulfilled. It takes one bite to know. because, really a decent chef is going to offer a stellar menu across the board. and everything we tried at Cafe Iguana was top notch. It is rather expensive but given the location and the difficulty of providing such authentic fare I'd say it's worth going there again
4
We went here for dinner on a Thursday and it was pretty crowded, but we were able to easily get a seat for dinner. We ordered a pitcher of margaritas which were strong and tasted great. The guacamole appetizer was good and the chips were crispy and pretty good as well. Dinner food was also pretty good with absolutely insane portion sizes. Price was fine given the size of the portions, though I would have preferred less food for smaller prices. That being said, I was eating in Clark's Quay so what should you really expect for prices. Lots of bros here, but overall the atmosphere was good and the location was great
5
I used to eat very regularly at Cafe Iguana when I lived in Singapore from 2004 to 2005. I always loved the flank steak fajitas with some Cholula sauce, washed down with a lime margherita. I returned to Singapore for a short break early in 2013, and it had not changed at all! The food is consistently fantastic, the margheritas are the best I have tasted, and the service is always excellent. I will go here each and every time I visit Singapore because I know I'll always enjoy it. The restaurant is also overlooking the river on Clarke Quay, which is a perfect spot. This really is a must if you are visiting and enjoy Mexican food
5
This place has great food and drinks. The frozen margaritas are to die for. It has a great location and service is also very good.
Should try out the frozen margaritas and shots and yummy fajitas. Must go place when you in Singapore.
4
Some things are quite expensive in Singapore, and we found the cheapest jugs here. Loved the complimentary chips that came with drinks!
4
Ordered 2x fajitas and a portion of chicken wings for myself and sonAlthough seemed expensive at around Â£15 for fajitas the quality and quantity made up for thisGreat quality washed down with a couple of beers , if you like Mexican and spice best restaurant I found in a great location on Clark quay give it a visit ;
5
We stumbled across Cafe iguana while looking for a place to eat at Clarke Quay. The cafe has a good atmosphere, the service was quick and attentive, and as other reviewers have said the food was as good as any Mexican food I have had before and we walked away very full after eating too much. I would recommend if you are looking for a casual dining experience at Clarke quay to consider Cafe Iguana
5
I have to say that the chicken tacos and frozen margaritas really are superb!! I thoroughly enjoyed the food and was really pleased I found this place after reading other reviews! The service is also very quick!!Be warned though, this place seems to gets busy. I made the mistake of thinking that as I was dining alone at around 6pm, that I would get a table easily - but when I got there, I found almost all the tables reserved.Luckily the nice waitress gave me a great seat on the waterfront as long as I vacated it before the reservation started at 7
5
Iguana has now become the place that we know we're talking about simply by exchanging a knowing glance. It never fails to give us a good time, and conversations go down really well, just like their margaritas.I'm a vegetarian - so my choices are limited but I'm happy with my nachos and chimmichangas, so it's all good. The staff is friendly, sometimes a little unattentive but responsive. I also love the music - they play a lot of latino and spanish tracks so it really sets the mood. Kudos
5
I'm picky about Mexican food, since I'm from Southern California. Cafe iguana was excellent. Good service, great food. They even brew their own beer. My date had a steak, which usually in Asia means you have to chew for awhile. This steak was tender, with a tequila lime sauce that added to the flavor. I had a fish enchilada, very tasty. The portions were enough, which is refreshing now days with so many overpriced restaurants with tiny portions of food on big white plates, leaving most diners hungry! The margaritas are good, too and the waiters kept refilling the chips and salsa gratis. We will certainly be back
3
Nice location and ambience but food was not that good. And this place is quite expensive. Only attraction is the rivet side seating otherwise I would not go to this place. The burrito was no good. My friend had the chimichanga and he left half of it
4
Can't comment on the food here apart from the tortilla Chips and salsa complimentary offered with your drinks, but the various margarita's on offer keep me coming back. The daily price offers help too! From 12-3pm a glass is $5.50, 3-6pm $7.50, then after 6pm around $9.50 excluding the tax.Blueberry, strawberry, soursop, lime, peach, mango, guava to name a few. The setting is along the riverside so great for people watching. Cheers
4
Four of us enjoyed our selections - the servings of soft tacos, chimichanga, burrito and fajitas were generous enough that each also got to taste what the others had chosen. The guacamole was superb and the items are served warm. We had make bookings at the restaurant but the speed of service and helpfulness of the staff was superb. Weather was nice so riverside walk seating was pleasant but they have a lot of indoor seating too. Accompaniment of warm chips and salsa complimentary was a delightful bonus
4
A must try. Roght at the heart of city's party place - Clarke Quay.
Here you get free tortilla chips with sauce alongiwth the booze. Margerita a must try. Try and go post 11 o'clock to avail better rates on margerita jugs.
4
Crossed the river from the man part of Clarke Quay and fund Cafe Iguana. Nice location on the water, good service and food. We had a chicken burrito and red snapper soft tacos and both were good.
4
We went on a Saturday night and it was packed! The vegetarian choices are limited but good. Slightly expensive prices. Drinks are discounted after 11! Patio overlooks the river which is nice.
4
This is right by the river near central mall. Thelocation is good and you can sit out in theevenings which is quite nice. They bring out chips and a healthy serving of dcent salsa. Also have a variety of spicy sauces. The food was good and service fine. We will be back there. Good for families
5
I am from Southern California which is basically some of the best Mexican food you can get! Cafe iguana's food isn't quite as authentic as it could be, but nonetheless, is delicious! You can enjoy yourself in a large group or a couple people. The margaritas are the best in Singapore and can be The cheapest depending what time you go! As time ticks by, the drinks get more expensive. An entire jug of margaritas is $22 sgd from 3-4. This is the price of one margarita anywhere else I've been!! I have to reiterate: the margaritas are to die for!!! They serve unlimited free chips and salsa which most places in sg don't and the chips are warm and the salsa is so yummy! The atmosphere is lovely. It is on the river across from Clarke Quay. You can sit by the river, outside under the canopy or inside. They have loads and loads of types of tequila!! The service could be a bit better, but that's not saying much in sg. All in all, it is my favorite place to eat out and I always come back! I'll be spending my birthday with friends there this coming weekend! Give it a try... You'll be back!
4
One of several Spanish-style tapas bars on Clarke Quay, Iguana delivers the goods, with some good cocktails and tapas. The service is pleasant and fast, but the place tends to fill up really quickly, which means that you might find yourself at a table in the arcade, with people constantly walking past your table. Alternatively, as the whole bar area is open to the quay, you could stake a spot at the long wooden bar. Recommended to while away a few hours of an evening listening to the great music and trying out their drinks menu
5
I came here on a Sunday evening with my family for dinner and Got a table outside straight away. everything seemed very efficient. Our order was taken promptly, and the free corn chips kept us busy while we waited. The fajitas are to die for - especially the flank steak. I would strongly recommend CafÃ© Iguan
5
we visited this place with our cousins who are local residents .. we were a family of 4 adults and 2 kids ( 8 & 3 year olds ) and went for lunch during the noon hours . the place was easily accesible and the water front was fun to see ( though hot in the noon ) ... the margharita's were large portions and excellent :-) :-) .... Our food order was turned around in pretty quick time and the kids specials were also accomodated with. the reqeust for spicy food for one was also done well and the overall experience was very good. the place is done up well and is a good place to hit with your friends as well ... liquor bar was not tested and neither were the deserts ! overall a good experience and a excellent place for mexican food :-) :-) ... whole family loved it :-
3
With so much competition for your money, I would go somewhere else. Unless you just want Mexican food. Th food was just o.k., the staff could have given better service. The drinks were over priced for the size and content. My daughter had a mango juice and was thoroughly happy. Also, she was happy with the vegetarian options on the menu
5
We often bring visitors to Cafe Iguana to experience really good Mexican food with a Margarita.The experience is always very enjoyable as you sit watching the activity on the River and the walking passerbysThe food is always of good standard and the ambience is excellentWould thoroughly recommend this oneCheck out the Happy Hour times for even better price
3
Margarita's were over priced and were not mixed very well. Free nachos and salsa were again very average.

better to go around evening...sit by the river side...great food and unlimited beverages (non alcoholic primarily). the quasadillas were so good for vegetarian choice. The nachos are on the house. Service is perfect
4
One our favourite places in SG. Lively and happy, excellent margaritas, pretty good food, friendly staff, and works well at lunch or dinner. The veggie bowl, lime/tequila chicken and stuffed poblano are good! Happy hours are very worth it.
5
Iguana has the best frozen margaritas..love the pink guava one. They have different rates over diff time slots..12-3 pm being the cheapest ( a jug of house margarita for s$ 22) & 8-11 being the priciest ( a jug of house margarita for s$ 57).Being a vegetarian , i absolutely love their vegetarian bowl. The nachos are yumm too.Cafe Iguana has indoor high stoot seating as well as a lovely outdoor seating overlooking the river & vibrancy of party hub Clark Quay
5
They have the best margarita in town. We usually order 1 jug of frozen lime margarita for two. They have happy hour prices and one jug can cost as low as $30 and as high as $59. It is worth it.I love their Camarones al diablo for starters. It comes with quesadilla with cheese and poblano chillis. They're awesome! The camarones al diablos' sauce is very very spicy which makes it a good dipping sauce for the quesadilla (already spicy in itself). But hey, I love spicy. You can always wash it up with the frozen margarita anyway. :)New york steak is also very very good although I don't usually get to the mains. I start and end my meal with starters + margarita. And I leave with a happy tummy

We went on a Friday night so it was very busy, we made a reservation and got a great table on the waterfront. The service was super friendly and efficient. We had the skewer sampler which was great, but as mains the Shredded Steak Soft Tacos were the best I have had anywhere, and that includes Mexico. The Chicken Fajitas were also great. We developed a bit of a taste for frozem Margaritas in LA and we ordered a jug at Cafe Iguana and it was excellent and the perfect thing on a humid Singporean night. We will make this a regular on our trips to Singapore
5
How can you start to describe and experience at Cafe Iguana, well firstly hands down the best restaurant in Singapore, not only the food is amazing, mouth watering and so worth whatever the [--] they ask for, but the entertainment of Asian couples taking pictures of their food is worth the trip down there. The fajitas are are undescribable, if you have them you won't regret them, the wait after ordering them is agonising but luckily you have free flow chips and salsa to pass the time untill the darkened skined waiter behind the bar starts giving you bad looks, then i suggest you stop ordering chips and salsa....but it's fine because by then you should have sight of your sizzling plate of fajitas accompanied with sour cream, guacamole and little [--] bits of tomatoes that don't really have much use, and are quite pointless to be frank but the wraps make up for them, the puer brilliant wraps, home-made fresh tortilla wraps....oh god they're amazing, you just order the fajitas for the wraps, AMAZIN
4
Enjoyed our visit to this Cafe as the staff were excellent. Beer could have been coder - we drank bottled beer (Corona because it is Mexican) - tap beer could have been colder. we didn't try the food but an ex-pat who is a regular said it was good. One of us drank too much Tequila - beware
4
I've been to Cafe Iguana on a number of trips to Singapore, and it never fails to deliver quality Tex-Mex. I make the distinction between Mexican food and Tex-Mex, and this is definitely the latter. Now, I'm from Texas, so that's not a bad thing! But if you're looking for something truly Mexican, like Sopes, or Pozole, well, this just isn't that place (and that place is going to be hard to find outside of the Americas) On this last visit I had the beef fajitas, which were great. I love my beef rare, and that's how it came out, but I asked for medium, so if you like your meat with a little less pink then you might want to ask for medium well, or well done. The fajitas were well seasoned, and came with five or six fresh flour tortillas, sour cream, salsa, and guacamole. The onions were nicely caramelized, and it really was great.Especially paired with the Paloma that I ordered. I asked them to substitute Mezcal for the Tequila (because that's how I've had them in Mexico) and it was really good. A perfect foil to the heartiness of the fajitas. And honestly, I was a little surprised they even HAD Mezcal. It can be pretty hard to come by
4
Located around the riverside point, the view was beautiful during the night with colorful lamps scorching the riverside. The food was good, even the simple appetizer like chips & salsa is terrific, i couldn't remember how many portions we ordered, moving to the main course, we had burritos, nachos and the spicy sauce chicken wings, beware of the blazing and spicy habanero sauce, i had problem dealing with it even i'm an Indonesian! Yet worry not about how much water you'll consume due to the spiciness, the ice water and ice lemon tea are refillable, and the service was very attentive, the waitresses refilled the drink for us as she noticed our nearly empty glass! Good selection of cocktails and margaritas as well...look no further for Mexican food, Cafe Iguana is the real deal
2
When ordering , we were asked do you want rice or beans with your order. We choose and were not informed there were additional charge incurred for the rice or beans ordered. It is not the money but the principle of it
3
Average food, below average service, average margaritas but good location. Disappointing overall. The waiter was pushy, abrupt to the point of rudeness and advised us not to have the house margarita special. Quite bizarre
5
Scrumptious food, great margaritas and extremely friendly service. All in all, great experience! Tried a variety of dishes. There's also a good choice for vegetarians.
4
Party of 5, no reservation, no river-view tables left, got an inside table, compensating factor was that the ceiling fans blew away the humidity and we felt much more comfortable.Started with a jug of Lime margarita - on ice, not frozen - what a good choice; tangy, alcoholic (100% blue agave El Jimador) and refreshing! Up there with some of the best I've had.Poured more than 6 drinks, so at S$57 was quite economical.We extended the complimentary corn chips, salsa, sour cream, guacamole with a large plate of Nachos (S$26 and slightly disappointing as the melted cheese did not permeate to the chips lower down - just a minor grumble).Mains were Vegi Burritos (1 x S$21), Shredded Steak Burritos (me, S$25), Prawn Burritos (1 x S$27) and 2 x Grilled Chicken Fajitas (S$27 each). All of them excellently prepared and presented and consumed with gusto! Overall a very good evening for a friends catchup with very good fare
4
The Mexican food here was very good, as well as the service! Decent portions which are well flavored.We decided to skip the beer menu and go straight to the jugs of frozen margaritas which are reasonably priced when stacked up next to the staggered increase in beer prices as the evening goes on in Singapore.I would definitely go there again and recommend it
4
Had a very nice lunch at Iguana, we were lucky enough to get a table. The place was rather packed. Good view across the river. Service was OK, not the fastest I've seen, but our waitress was very friendly and the food and drinks arrived in good time. Would I go back? Definitely
5
If you're in Clarke Quay be sure to drop in Iguana but you would be lucky to get a seat. So its always a good idea to check in early or make a reservation. The food is excellent and super hot but mix that with a party atmosphere and cool bunch of crowd, we got one formula thats hard to beat. 4 years since my first visit, Iguana don't disappoint much each time
4
Although the menu is not extensive, the food we had was delicious. Big servings, efficient service, lively fun atmosphere.We ate grilled veggie fajitas that had all the trimmings and salad tacos in which lettuce cups were used instead of shells and a served with a spicy low fat ranch dressing.The cocktails were good value and the chile chocolate cake with mojito sauce and homemade vanilla ice cream really topped off a great menu.Was fabulous to watch all the boats moving along the river
3
Food here is served in very large portion, I don't think many could finish a starter and a min course! The food is good, though a couple of dishes could have done with a little more sour cream/guacamole or similar as they were a little dry. Happy hour drinks are good value: SGD 39 for a pitcher of margaritas.
4
It's a great place, with a lively ambiance. Offers a good view in the evenings of the ever happening Clarke Quay. Furniture needs up gradation. They serve, very good authentic Mexican and offer a decent choice of platter for Vegetarians too. Servings are filling enough. The place, is fairly priced and have a decent offering on the wine menu too
4
We were pleasantly surprised by the mexican food here. Really enjoyed everything we ordered that night. Great service and super location !
4
Good food, good drinks, great ambience. The chicken wings here are a must-try! Perfect place to grab a bite or just chill out late in the evening after work.
4
We visited this place just to do some relaxing, down by the riveside. Drink were not very xpensive, but prices increase when it's getting later. Anyway: a pla e to recomend to friends. Hope to come back one day.
5
The food at this Mexican restaurant is excellent. Situated right in Clarke Quay with awesome views of the river. Love the Strawberry Margaritas!
4
So tasty and such an awesome vibe when we were there on the friday evening. Very full and loud and amazing cocktails. Staff were great as well.
5
We went with out of town visitors and children and all had a really nice time. The fajitas were the highlight of the meal as they were really flavorsome and fresh. The childrens options gave enough choice for all to be happy. Portions were very filling and the frozen margaritas very refreshing. Sitting outside watching the world go by was a highlight for our visitors. We found the service friendly, efficient, casual and above expectation for this type of restaurant
4
I find this to be the best mexican restaurant in Singapore and have found all the dishes that I'd tried there to be fantastic. Comparing it to NYC and its wide variety of Mexican restaurants, I thought that I'd be hard to find a good place here, but, thankfully, I was wrong. Go there. Order a pitch of the Guava margaritas and the chicken chimichangas. Be happy
4
I head here everytime I visit Singapore. It's such a fun place. The atmosphere is great and the food is so yummy (even if it's slightly wrong choosing Mexican in a city full of Asian culinary delights!). Then there's the drinks too. If you love cocktails this is the place... the mars bar shot is simply devine
5
Was at cafe iguana last nite with a couple of my girl friends. This wasn't my first time at cafe iguana. I usually go there every time I am in Singapore and they never disappoint me. Nachos as burritos are a must try. Love their margaritas. Chocolate cake desert is a great way to end unless you want to try sopapilla. Dont like their banana chimichanga though.
4
Some people say this place is slightly expensive/pricey. Yeah, I suppose it could be but it's not as though people frequent this place every week (or are they? heh). I think it's worth it because the food is tasty. My favourite is the steak or mushroom fajitas. The chicken fajitas can be dry so I rarely order that. The margaritas are of course the main attraction. Yummy
4
another good place to eat and value for money and great drunks thanks trip advisor for the new app city guide so amazing follow the arrow how far etc .Blew me away dont even need wire less
4
Visited here for the first time on a Sunday night when Clarke Quay was generally quiet. Nice drinks, reasonably quick service. Somewhat complicated beer pricing, with around 4 or 5 different prices depending on time of day. Good crunchy complementary corn chips.
3
Nachos for started....the cheese was rather bland and salsa dip not that great. Fajitas was average but enjoyed my lime juice very much. Staff was friendly and helpful.
4
One of the better (if not the best) margarita bar in Singapore, with a great atmosphere to enjoy lovely margaritas to wash down the tacos, burritos and other great Mexican dishes.
5
If you are a fan of mexican food then this is the place for you ... the dishes are well presented, very fresh and consistently good quality. A couple of cadillac margarita's to wash it down and round the evening off ...Worth booking if you want a seat inside. Very friendly, good service and a great place to eat with friends
4
I love Mexican however I am unable to eat bell peppers / capsicum which means that I usually aviod eating out for Mexican. However the service and attention was fantastic after explaining my problem I was assured that I would be able to change the menu to suit. I had someone go through the entire menu with me and explain what was in each dish and if they could cook it without capsicum. The food was very good and tasty. I eat way too much but it was lovely. I can also recommend the frozen margaritas
5
As a Chicago native currently living in Thailand, I have had a serious lack of Mexican food in my diet. After a few lackluster Mexican food attempts in Bangkok, I was determined to find better Mexican food (specifically guacamole) on my recent Singapore holiday. The menu is extensive, but I went with the vegetable chimichanga. It arrived toasted to perfection, full of perfectly cooked veggies, and covered in chunky guacamole and sour cream. It was easily the best Mexican food I've had in Southeast Asia and I would be completely happy being served that meal in the states. My boyfriend had the pork soft tacos and was equally impressed. The complimentary chips and salsa were good, but I skipped the incredibly overpriced cocktails. The menu is confusing when it comes to drink prices as there are nearly three prices for each drink depending on the time of day! We were lucky to snag a table outside in the evening which provided the perfect setting for this delicious meal
3
Excellent location for people watching and after-dinner partying (especially on weekends). The food is pretty decent, though not the greatest when it comes to VFM. Service is good. Pretty good variety in the menu. I dont drink so was unable to sample their signature drinks and tequila, but I hear good things about them from my friends
4
Cafe Iguana is popular and is often hard to get a table unless you go early. They only take walk-in s after 7 15 pm. For Singapore standard, the food is not cheap ($5 a prawn) but good. They serve a wide range of margaritas, delicious prawn quesadillas and perfectly grilled prawn fajitas. Service is good and they are quick. Situated at a nice location, it is nice place to relax and chill out. Do take advantage of their happy hours
3
Been here a few times over a few years. It is fun. Let's face it, you don't choose Mexican for fine dining. But the food is good. The chillie range should cover all tastes from adventurous to timid, and the best range of tequila inside or outside of Mexico.The position is fine, overlooking the river, and service is attentive. Again a good choice for a fun time, but if you view yourself as a food critic, maybe there are better choices
4
Nice place to catch up with your friends...good mexican starters and "Dark Beer" is extremely good...
Sitting outside (@ Clarke Quay) it gives you a nice feel and we had a wonderful time having Chimmichangas and Beer...
3
I met some clients here for dinner. Service was ok and the meal was ok. Nothing awesome. I think there are better options in Singapore
3
Very fun, social atmosphere. The beer is great but the margaritas are watered down and below average...in general the food is pretty good. The Nachos are a bit weird and the serving size in on the small side.
4
Good food and beer. Service pretty good considering how crowded it gets. Prices reasonable.
5
A favorite for ambience and fun, with good Mexican fare
5
one of the best mexican food i've had, n awesome margarita. Staff were really sweet and friendly.
3
Margaritas and beers - good!Soft drinks for the kids - free top up, perfect for our thirsty kids!tried various food which was ok, but not more than that. Probably the asian variant of mexican (vs me used to the norwegian - which might not be close to the thruth neither!)will probably be back if we want some mexican and do not want to make ourselve
3
Went here on the weekend and it was super packed. Ordered a couple of starters and 2 mains..Best mexican food in Singapore so far...The drinks were a complete let down. Not only are the drinks expensive but they need to learn how to make better margaritas....Worth it for the food but drink elsewhere before going here for dinner. Rating would have been very good if the cocktails were reasonably priced and well made
3
Like earlier reviews said, very fun and lively atmosphere. Drinks from 8-11pm are incredibly expensive. A jug of margarita from 12-3pm is $22, but from 8-11pm is $69. Ridiculous. Beer goes up double too. I refused to order a margarita based on that, and ordered a soft drink for $6.50. We just had some starters as wanted to share things and weren't overly hungry. You get free chips and salsa but the chips needed salt which was no where to be seen. The quesadillas are tasty and good value, you get two tortillas folded over, so large portion for an entree. The mini chimichangas were good but the guac and sour cream is just poured on top, not good if you dislike either. The service was good to start but by the end of our evening it was impossible to find anyone to order more drinks or even get the bill. Seemed to be a hassle. Staff who had stopped work for the night were hanging around texting still in uniform, but not working. Then when we finally asked for the bill, the waiter printed it, then went off with it and my credit card for a few minutes out of sight, then returned - not overly assuring. Fun but pricy
2
To start off, the drinks were rather diluted. But what made the evening worse was when the service staff came to tell us we couldn't play our drinking games with poker cards because they have a no gambling policy. That was rather ridiculous considering we were not gambling, there were no stakes involved and we just happened to be using poker cards. We tried explaining this but they were really inflexible about it which dampened the evening. What broke the camel's back was when the same waiter cleared our drinks prematurely and did so in a snappy manner that resulted in some chocolate (from a chocolate shot) falling on my leather bag. No only was he sulky, there was no apology and no attempt at offering a tissue. Never went back again.
2
I ate here during a recent trip to Singapore. While the past meals were always good, this time something didnt agree with myself or my dinner guest. We were both sick that evening and the next full day.
4
Standard mexican food but a fun, informal, slightly loud setting. Good for a group of people.
5
It's very good and delicious with a large variety of starters, so share lots of starters with you're family. I recommend the Seafood Soppes.
5
Food is great, lots of different flavours of margaritas, happy hour before 8pm and after 11pm. Very good atmosphere!
4
Cafe iguana is one of the better places to eat in Clarke quay. Portions are generous and the food certainly packs a punch! Excellent margaritas
4
Out of all the mushrooming resto's on the River Side , I love Iguana the most, Awesome food, Spicy , Authentic Fajita's, quesadillas, with cheddar cheese, this is one place you shouldnt be missing , cos Singapore isnt a spicy food place otherwise. Good collection of beer with Hoegaarden on the menu too :
5
It has some the best Mexican food away from Mexico, its loud, fast, always full. The food is amazingly good.We found this place 4 yrs ago when staying at Swissotel Merchant Court, and had to go back and see if it was still there. It was, and still is great.
4
I've been to Singapore on several occasions and I always make the Cafe Iguana a must visit. Maybe for a taste of something familiar..but the food is great. A pitcher of Iguanarita's goes down well...but make it happy hour for a cheaper drink. Nothing in Singapore "western foor" is cheap, so take advantage of happy hour. Located on the Singapore river, its great for people watching. Just across the bridge from Clark Quay on the right. Or take the Riverside MRT stop
3
This restaurant is nice. Atmosphere good, a bit crowded and seating is sometimes shared which for us from the States is not normal. Margaritas were very good. Food was so so....All in all though the location by Clark quay is great for a night out. Food and drinks at places like this in Singapore can be quite expensive! We ended up spending 295.00 Sgd. for three of us. Courtesy and service was great
4
Being an expat and eating mostly Asian food, it was a joy to eat some good Mexican food. I don't know anyone can really not do Mexican well. I found the food tasy and as Mexican as anywhere else. Customer service I give it 10/10. My order was taken quickly, food served in good time, wait staff asked me if my meal was to my liking & if they could get me anything extra. It was reasonably expensive but so are all restaurants along the river.
2
Terrible service, average food and huge prices. It took more than 1 hour tho served the food
4
This is as good as Mexican gets in Singapore with a nice quayside ambiance. It should be noted, that Mexican is more Tex-Mex than what you might find in Oaxaca or Guadalajara. Good service.
3
Food's average but the frozen margaritas are great!
3
Extensive menu with plenty to choose from. Food is tasty and decent sized portions.Big restaurant with plenty of outside tables on the evening.Pretty expensive though although this is normal for the Clarke Quay area.Worth a visit if you like Mexican and spicy foods
4
I love my nachos and my burritos and have been having them around the world. But cafe Iguana is something special. The nachos here are different and perhaps the best i have eaten in a long time. The view is excellent. And if you can manage a ricerside table on a weekend night at Clarke Quay, you have set yourself up for the most beautiful dinner date.The menu has a lot to offer for everyone. Even vegeterians. And while I would have loved to have the fajitas a little more authentic, I believe they do a great job with most of the items on the menu.The service is courteus and the portions large. It's a good place to be :
3
Cafe Iguana has a strong following ..well deserved .a great hang-out place at most nights of the week, very popular with expats, good atmosphere and fantastic staff. I wouldn't go there for food ..if I wanted Mexican there are better places. But to sit next to the river, watch the crowd ..then enjoy the bar ...great cocktails 
4
My business colleague and I were touring Chinatown and then headed over to Clark Quay for an early dinner. We came across Cafe Iguana and got a hankering for something different than Asian and Mexican sounded good. They have a good happy hour that starts in the afternoon and gets more expensive towards the evening. I had several frozen margarita's and they were small but good and they did not skimp on the tequlia. The chips and especially the salsa were really good. I ordered 1 beef and 1 chicken enchilada and my friend ordered the chili rellenos. Both came with Mexican Rice, but no refrieds which was dissapointing. His was very good and mine was also good but could have been much better. Let me say that my enchiladas were absolute chocked full of meat...more so than I have ever had anywhere else. The meat flavoring was delicious. What was missing was red sauce (you should have your choice of red or green) and the melted cheese on top of the enchiladas which is typical for how it should be made. If they simply added that it would knock your socks off. I still ate it all and it still was delicious. It could have been even better. Most times in the states it is the opposite, you get a big cheese ball with little meat, this was the opposite. I will definitely visit this restaurant again even if they don't fix the enchiliadas, they are still very good. By the way the polo shirts they have are really cool looking and a fair price
4
We had a few hours before we had to be at the airport so we went for a walk along the river starting at the Clarke Quay. I was around lunch time and noticed that along the bank was a row of what seemed to be a very popular strip of restaurants, one of which was Cafe Iguana. The beer selection was a bit limited but would recommend the house beer. As for the food...you better be hungry. The staff were great and the food was FANTASTIC! and not to mention reasonably priced. The only thing we sent back was the dessert menu because there was no way we could fit another mouthful in
4
The Cafe Iguana was a great dinner place. The portions are just right. You can finish all your plate and are full too. The drinks are just yummy, a little expensive though. Tip: try to go early, you might need to wait for a table otherwise.
3
I LOVE the decor at Cafe Iguana! It is right on the riverfront, surrounded by some really popular restaurants and pubs and the place has a real buzz about it on weekend nights. Seating is rather limited, so unless you are comfortable with being perched up on the stools inside the restaurant, you have to book in advance. The alfresco area is much nicer anyways. I totally love the Camarones al Diablo. It is more sour than spicy or hot, but I love it anyways. But that also could be beause I'm a huge fan of prawns. There are plenty of vegetarian options but they certainly don't taste the best. If you are looking for really great Mexican food, then this is certainly not the best place. But their drinks are excellent and they have Happy Hour till 11pm and it is open till 3am on weekends!!! All in all, it's a good place to hang out and chill with friends on a Friday or Saturday night, if you want a tequilla and margherita night
3
Great spot for outdoor eating and people watching. Drinks are decent, but they don't have sangria.
4
We have been to Cafe Iguana a few times and as always the service is great, even when busy.
The food is very nice and reasonably priced for the Clarke Quay area!
3
Love the margaritas! And everyone should try the Chili shot :)
5
Absolutely great mex food. A must if you like mexican food and the ambience near Clarke Quai is a great package. Very highly recommended - for vegetarians even more.
4
Simply Superb Mexican
1
I went there with my husband and another 2 friends.We all drank and ate dinner there.The drink quality was so so..a little bit sugary with weak alcohol.Nothing likes most of Mexican places I has been.Most of them had a great margarita.My seafood dish was all burned black with flavorless.My husband chicken taco's wasn't hot when they serving plus flavorless.So,we both left all the food after 2 bites.Our friend plats were the same..We left this restaurant with full plate of foods...It was a hungry night!!
4
We've visited Cafe Iguanas a couple times over the years, our last visit being this past weekend. The Margaritas, $14 each were both good, not great but not bad. Our two dishes came with mixed feelings. Our quesadillas were a bit on the poor side of quality and taste. We wouldn't recommend this dish, especially at the price of $16 (or $18 can't recall exactly). However, the chicken burrito was pretty good (expensive at $28) if a bit on the dry side. It would have been nice to have had sour cream or a bit of extra salsa to go with this dish but overall it was pretty good for what you can expect in this part of Asia. We would recommend this dish. We didn't try desert but the sopapillas that we saw others eating looked pretty good. Having eaten here a couple times, I think we would be inclined to try another dining venue, Clark Quay having many to choose from. However, if you are in SE Asia for some time and have a craving for Tex-Mex, Cafe Iguanas is not a bad choice
1
This place tries to deliver more authentic mexican food but fails miserably. I have eaten here twice in 2010, both times i left over 80% of the food on my plate. My dinner companions, all used to both popculture mexican and authentic mexican food all agreed - we were all disappointed with the food. In addition, portions were very small - and way over priced per dish. They clearly want you to eat multiple courses if they can get you to drink enough ot not taste the food.Essentially, they are trading to try and sell booze - but packaging themselves as a proper mexican restaurant. Margartias were watered down and full of sugar - not a particularly pleasing drink unless you wanted to avoid alcohol... cheaper to buy a glass of lemon juice for the same effect
4
Firstly I cannot comment on the food as i've only ever drunk here. Happy hour is from opening until 8pm and a jug of very nice margarita can be had for next to nothing. A free tray of nachos and salsa is thrown in with each jug too. What more could you want than a table out front, watching the bizarre assortment of passer-bys with a jug of dirt cheap frozen margarita and a tray of nachos? Top marks from me
2
There's no doubt that Clarke Quay is a nice area to spend an evening in Singapore and the huge choice of bars and restaurants makes it almost impossible not to find something you would like. Cafe Igauana is certainly a busy and popular choice and looks appealing with its familiar tex-mex decor and "fun" atmosphere. It was packed when restaurants either side of it were only a quarter full.Unfortunately the appeal is only superfluous and the restaurant is a complete and utter rip-off. The service is quite good, friendly, reasonably quick and helpful. There it ends.The margaritas are weak and grossly over-priced. $52 for a small pitcher of house margarita - come on! They were running a drinks "promotion" which was a sneaky and poorly-hidden attempt to push customers into coming back a second time. The promotion yielded nothing to any of our party of 12 and left a poor perception of the restaurant's motives and management.The food is quite probably the worst mexican food I have ever tried to eat and was again, grossly over-priced for very low quality fare. $24 for a dry, bland "steak" burrito with no extra side orders.By all means go there for a bottled beer (they can't tamper with that) and enjoy the Clarke ambience but steer clear of the food and cocktails. Also, don't be fooled by the "authentic" claims. We were there on Cinco Do Mayo and no-one on the staff had any idea what that was or why it might be significant to a restaurant that claims to be Mexican
4
One of the "fun"-er places to eat in town... Food is forgettable tho
4
Great food at good prices - the steak fajitas are superb. Whether you are after a great meal or meeting for a few drinks, then this is a great choice. You get a lot for your money.
2
I don't really like the food there, but its a good place for chilling out with friends.
4
i think...by far the best Mexican in town
4
Altho the drinks are not bad, the service can be quite slow during peak hours.
3
Great place for a big group hangout... Food are not bad..
3
Nice location, good beer and reasonable Mexican food
3
Wide selection of tequila.
5
greta all rounder,
5
still the best ever!
3
It's just another cafe.
4
Best Margaritas in town...good crowd also. Extensive tequila variety. Food passable
3
Best margaritas!
5
magaritas on sundays!
2
for drinks maybe, not the food definitely!
3
Margarita's is better, but the ambiance at the river is quite nice. S$52 for a jug of top shelf tequila margarita.
2
Friendly staff, good service-food-8
5
Go Clarke Quay??? Why not as long as having this place
3
serves one of the best magaritas. overall food is good.
4
Great mexican fare, and a fine range of tequilas. Their margharita's are quite popular - although one can barely feel the tequila, they certainly make for a good sugar rush! Used to be one of my favorite places - a little too popular and crowded for my taste now
4
Cheap margaritas at happy hour, and the chimichangas and burritos are pretty good.
4
Not many mexican food joints around. I like the meals here. the portions are big as well. Will def go for it if am arnd that area.
2
Don't really expect good Mexican food in Singapore, do you?
4
Really good margaritas served here, and love the mexican food.
2
Last time i was there I had about 15 margaritas and walked away sober - dont think they were very strong - oh and the food was crap
3
Good for drinks, and just hanging out with your friends. But a tad noisy though.
Their margaritas are good.
3
margaritas...... slurp!
3

Must reserve table in advance as the place is always packed. Slightly overpriced and outdoor seating is divided into smoking and non-smoking zones. Staff are friendly and efficient though.
