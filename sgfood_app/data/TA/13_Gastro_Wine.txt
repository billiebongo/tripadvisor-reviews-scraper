Had wine & dinner on a weekday, the outlet was a little quiet.
However, the staff were all friendly and pleasant, offering us good recommendations for wine & food.
Nice place to chill and I'll be back soon with other drinking buddies.

Great wine bar that has great
Food, especially the blood pudding, and a choice of fanstastic of wine, is great. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed and the service is excellent. Definitely the place to go if you like your wine. üç∑

Great food to share made with great products - Friendly service and amazing wine selection at a decent price (for Singapore!)
A simple night can end up dancing on the bar drinking red wine ;)

Had dinner with friends, almost empty on a Saturday evening. Extensive wine list though not all available, however you will still find a wine that you will love. Food is served as small bites but hit & miss. Tomato with burratina was quite good, greens too expensive for what you get, tar ti flette not nice. Quite a big selection of cheese but some already too old for consumption. Nice ambience.

I pride myself on being able to sniff out a good wine bar from 100 paces, so how I missed this gem of a place for over a year I cannot explain! excellent selection of (mostly) French wines, great food and just amazing service - water on the table before you sit down, recommendations on pairings, constant check on food/service without being intrusive, what on earth's not to like!! Not cheap but well worth every penny, Should you be staying at nearby Lloyds Inn, this is an excellent place to get some breakfast cum cheese platters in advance for morning or evening eats

As someone who seeks good wine, I go to this place about once every six weeks. The wine list is good and the food is limited but fair. The service is excellent. It is well located if in the Orchard area and the atmosphere is quite informal and friendly. If wine and food are the only criteria, the places I would put ahead of it are Napoleon and Ginnet. They have better value for money and the wines are from the better years of Bordeaux. Besides a larger food menu. Wine connection is worse.

Within walking distance of parts of Orchard road but on a quiet part of Killiney Street and above a dingy little bar - this out of the way immediately radiates a warm and welcoming ambience as you enter.I was a little early on a Friday night hoping to beat the weekend crowds but was pleasantly surprised to find the traffic pretty light - probably because of the slightly away from centre location.Very friendly and knowledgeable staff who were happy to advise and accommodate my desire to experiment and explore wines and cheeses - of which they have an extensive range.We had a little chat about what I liked (hard, old, goat cheeses) and wines and I was presented with a curated selection of cheeses - all but one of which were right on the money, and a champagne, white and red selection that were all new to me and poured out of freshly opened bottles.I loved the place AND the personal attention I got thanks to the light traffic AND the freshness of the small plates that I could pick from AND the selection of wines I was given

I was going through Singapore on one night lay-over and a friend recommended me this place for a fun night with good food and wines! It met my expectations and the 2 gentlemen partners running this place know how to enjoy and share their passion.Just eat bite size food and try as much wine by the glass is the motto!Thanks Jeff and Bruno for a great night!Do

Top wine list, very good tapas, the meat is greatly grilled. And the atmosphere loads of fun. Would be back soon.

Nice quiet spot with a long menu of French wines. Ask for recommendations from the people there - they're very attentive and happy to help.

The location is very good, close to Somerset MRT station. The wine prices were very acceptable, and all the service staff were attentive and friendly.

Great selection of wines at decent price.
Food was great - best dishes are the platters, beef and fat fries cooked with duck fat!
5
Tried the Killiney branch after enjoying several occasions to dine at their other branch. Menu was the same and wine list the same, which meant we enjoyed the food and ambiance as usual. Thanks Jeffrey!

This is our second visit and will not be our last, thoroughly enjoyable evening tasting superb bottles of wine and sharing food platters (can highly recommend the charcuterie platter)!

Living within 50meters of this place, I must have past it more than hundred times without noticing it. By googling wine bar one day, I found it. A truly great place to enjoy excellent wines, a wide selection of whiskey and other liquors. The service and atmosphere is great. Very relaxing The staff has an excellent knowledge of the wines, cheeses and the food they serve. Absolutely recommendable..

Not sure I should be advertising this place as is a hidden gem and wish it to stay that way. But it is becoming very popular and understandably so. Great atmosphere and layout. Great staff. Great service. Good selection of wines. Food suitable to go with the wine. Just a great place to meet and be sociable over a bottle or two of win

A great place to unwind after a long day. An excellent selection of old and new world wines in an inviting and cozy environment. The servers are nice and accommodating. The portions are good for sharing. Though a famished one would certainly think twice about parting with a mouthful of that delicious tarte tatin: layers of savoury roasted tomatoes topped by creamy buratta and pine nuts and anointed with a splash of olive oil and balsamic. The contrast between sweet and salty, sour and nutty made it truly divine. The aubergine pizza was nicely burnt, imparting a smoky meatiness to each slice. These were paired with sweet riesling. The dessert was mediocre - the molten chocolate cake was a bit chalky and was only saved by the acidity of the accompanying raspberry coulis. Nonetheless, it was still great eating. And oh, the servers are nice and accommodating.
