It was a small cafe and we came here with a client of ours.
Hmm the food was just ok despite the fact we ordered the signature Vietnamese bolognise.
Would come and try again other foods to be able to give more better comments.
5
Four of us called in for lunch and coffee and thoroughly enjoyed the items we had. Back today, still great and will be back again tomorrow before we fly out. Best flat white I have had in Singapore.
5
The food here is a must try. So many delicious dishes that all have a twist of the contemporary. I have never had a meal that I was disappointed with at Epicurious. The service is great and the location is also excellent.
3
Epicurious has moved to a rather... not so nice place compared to the previous place. It is now at UE Square Mall, no longer with a nice terrace by the river.
Location being everything...
3
Closed on Monday, but definitely a quiet place for a good brunch or lunch, nice cosy space with both indoor and outdoor seating. Serving western food with pasta, sandwiches and so on.
4
We went here for a recent working lunch. Service was friendly and quick and everyone's food was served together and was all great.
I would certainly go back for lunch (or breakfast / coffee) there again when back in Singapore!
5
Epicurious is an institution, in place at Robertson Quay almost from the beginning when it was redeveloped about fifteen years ago. Nice view of the river and the crazy painted bridge.Famous for their excellent Sunday brunches - try the totally delicious Eggs Benedict in particular.But actually a wonderful place every day - a good lunch spot, a friendly chill out evening place in the weekdays and weekends too.Helen and Sharon, the owner-operators add a friendly touch.Unpretentious and reasonably priced.This little cafe really epitomises much of the best of Singapore
5
It's back and its as ok as it always wasGREEN EGGS are fabulous The new place may not have the presence it used to and to be honest the mall is dark and about as much fun as a funeral but the restaurant itself is fineThe service is great and Joyce is as wonderful as eve
5
My wife and I were checking out some shops at UE Square Shopping Mall this afternoon when we chanced upon this new place, Epicurious. We had a wonderful lunch consisting of homemade baked chicken with roast vegetables and a sous-vide chicken salad with lentils & kale pesto... They also serve a wide selections of all-day breakfast! The service team was simply wonderful! Special thanks to the manager, Helena Lim, for making our afternoon a memorable one. (Note: not sure why it still shows the restaurant address to be at 60 Robertson Quay
5
Epi offers great service and excellent food with a nice view of the riverSadly they are movingBut only to ue square nearbyI am sure with Joyce and Helena around they will make it a wonderful family setting I highly recommend the green eggs and orange juiceBest in tow
5
Visited twice during our 4 days in Singapore. Food was delicious and service was friendly and quick. If you have room, try the desserts!
4
Helena and her team were wonderful in catering to my husband's dietary requirements. The food was fresh and very yummy with special mention to their fried chicken wings, barramundi and creme brÃ»lÃ©e. Thank you for a very enjoyable night out! ðŸ˜Š
4
Brunched here with the family. Food was tasty and good value. Drinks were great as well. Ginger Ale hits the right spot. Service was quick despite the full restaurant.
4
We stopped in here for breakfast fairly early on Saturday morning. The young ladies working there were friendly and cheerful( something that we'd been missing in several other Singapore dining experiences). Latte was good, and my husband tried a matcha latte, which was quite nice. We both had the breakfast burrito, which was quite large, full of scrambled egg with bits of chorizo. The salsa on the side was fresh and tasty, and the side of potatoes were yum! All up, a tasty, filling breakfast
1
Looks nice but the arrival of a handwritten bill without breakdown at end of meal and then being told "that's the way we do it" underscores why the veneer of passive aggressive service is easily awakened. Very average food and a vibe of hostility let me know this place is run for cash, not for its customers
4
Epicurious is an excellent place for the Sunday brunch. Place gets full quite early in the morning, but friendly staff tries to find good tables for everyone. Brunch menu is not big, but it was easy to find something for everyone. Epicurious is located in nice place next to Singapore river in Robertson quay.
1
We ordered a matcha latte and a rainbow toasties. The latte was watery and we can barely taste the green tea, and the toastie reminded me of my college life meals. It was using a Gardenia thick toast looking bread, and average mozzarella cheese. We paid $18.20, and to add to the insult there were filthy water dripping from their awning to our seat, and actually dripped on my husband's shirt when they retracted it without checking properly at the outdoor seating area. I reviewed their poor quality on their Facebook and was replied with sarcasm. Worse cafe experience ever
5
We had brunch on a late Sunday morning. We were seated in the verandah where we could see a lot of persons passing by along the Quay. The restaurant is located in the midst of a number of similar establishments and has a pleasant atmosphere.The brunch dishes were excellent & quite filling.Overall a very pleasant experience
3
I had high hopes for my lunch at Epicurious (maybe because of the crowd I see there on the weekends) but I wasnâ€™t too blown away when I tried food with a cup of latte. Food and coffee was pretty average. But one thingâ€™s for sure, great view and a nice environment for a lazy day out
5
We happened upon this cafe by the river one day and had a lovely lunch. My husband had a croque monsieur that he loved and I really liked my "beef bowl" (see photo). We sat outside but under their shaded arcade so it was very pleasant (and not too hot). The staff at Epicurious were charming and gracious
5
Our go to on Saturday morning when we have nothing in the house. Don't miss their home made ginger ale.
4
Consistently a pleasant experience. Not quite the same since Good Eat closed down next door. The ladies always look after me here.
5
Just had an early lunch / late breakfast at epicurious. Staff were friendly the menu was well chosen with a good selection and all day breakfast. Great spot
5
Delicious home cooking. Unpretentious which is challenging to find in Singapore! This is such an affordable great breakfast find for families and couples alike.
5
we had breakfast on 12/7/15 and it was very tasty and well cooked. The location is exceptional as was the serve. Highly recommended
3
Often walked past this place & it is always busy, so we thought we would try. Menu is good, service very good & friendly. However, my meal was rather disappointing both in presentation & taste. Both meals were Rather bland for how they were described in the menu. The place is always busy, so they're obviously doing something right. Hoping that We just Chose wrong.
5
Like many of you, I rely on reviews to maximize opportunities for good eats (rather than duff ones). Epicurious and its reviews didn't disappoint.It was a quiet Sunday night when I visited, just before closing. I was craving burger,, and Epicurious was on the Top Ten list in Singapore, and it was nearby. The staff were friendly and I plonked myself down at the long bench table inside. It only has a small area inside with fans/AC, and most seating was 'al fresco' (which is a strange term to use in Singapore because the humidity is never 'fresco') ,,,,The burger was worth the short wait, when it arrived with a small bucket of fries and ketchup/wonderful lime mayo dressings. The burger was not large, but tasted great, very succulent, well seasoned. With a mesclun of lettuce, tomato and cucumber on the lid of the bun, and sauteed onions and mushrooms on top of the burger, it was a treat. You will need a napkin to stay clean, and the patty needed a little corralling once you got stuck into it, but a great burger. Epicurious gets the Tyke seal of approval on their burger! Hope I'll be back one day
3
Got the breakfast burrito and coconut water, my friend got the Eggs Ben. Both of us ended up dousing our food in salt and pepper, it didn't help much. They put ice in the coconut water. Service is a bit slow. I got a side of chopped spinach, turned out to be unseasoned boiled spinach (I should have clarified). Bill was SGD25 per person. Seems like a popular place, but I don't think I'd go back
5
High priced hotel food sent us across the pedestrian bridge to the cluster of restaurants and bars at lRobertson Quay. I had a steak and my husband a Carbonara. Both were delicious with fresh, home-cooked flavour. Pricing was very reasonable- my steak was just $24 and very tender and tasty. This is a gem! We finished off with a generous serving of apple crumble and icecream with coffee.Free entertainment came with several fly pasts by the Singapore airforce in preparation for Singapore's 50th birthday coming up shortly
4
I had one of the yummiest, juiciest hamburgers ever.Other items on the menu loooked great too... mixed influences (Iranian, North African, Asian and Western fusion)Good house wine (white was very good; red was not so).Small homey-style place. Perfect location in Robertson Quay area.Keep up the good work, ladies !!
5
Friendly and efficient service.
Same price as elsewhere but good quality of food which you don't get everywhere. Try the lemongrass and ginger creme brÃ»lÃ©e which is really amazing.
3
Decent breakfast place with a fairly wide selection of breakfast items. I had the french toast which was pretty good. Nice to sit outdoors on a lazy morning as it's by the river and good for people watching.
4
My niece took us to Epicurious as it is close to her home, We went for lunch,She had a wonderful salad that was a decent size and I had a buritto and my partner had a sandwhich, all were good sizes and very tasty, the only issue was that my buritto was in 2 very thick slices of bread instead of a tortilla, this to me wasn't what I wanted but it was very flavoursome.My niece was so impressed with her salad and ordered a takeaway salad for her husband.We also ordered takeaway coffees when we left
4
I have been eating at Epicurious for about 8 years. Each time I visit, I order different items, sometimes the cheese board, the specials, and I have decided my favourite is their burger.I eat that most often and when I get a craving for a burger, I will eventually pop in for one.I go for the complete experience! Mushrooms etc and it never disappoints.During one of my visits, I sat next to a couple and they were enjoying their meal and my burger arrived. They looked at my burger in surprise and I could not stop myself but to tell them they should try it the next time they come.The other reason I find myself going there and relaxing for an hour or two or more is that the riverwalk is so pleasant. I get to sit and watch the world go by. It is a complete experience. Good food, good service and the location makes me realise that Singapore is quite a nice place to be in
5
I've lived in the area for a little over a year now...and I live for breakfast on the weekends. I usually try a new place about once a week based on reviews I read here, burple, etc. I drive so I really have been able to try places far and wide in Singapore. I've passed this place on my way to others many times, but normally around noon it's VERY crowded so I haven't stopped. I am so glad I got an early start today. The menu is perfect. The service is great (can't speak for when it's busy) and the ambience is nice. The food and the presentation were wonderful. I'm done searching. Can't wait to come back and try something else!
4
Dropped in for lunch. Had some very tasty dishes that appeared to be made on site rather than using processed foods. The pasta and prawns were delicious, accompanied by some fantastic garlic bread with melted cheese. The burger-wich had a very tasty homemade burger between thick bread including a fried egg, streaky bacon and good sauces. Just didn't need the plastic burger cheese, also, the fried potatoes were a little hard, but overall it was very homely and satisfying. Finished with the sticky date cake and ice cream which again tasted homemade. It just needed more butterscotch sauce to make it excellent. Great little restaurant for a tasty lunch with good friendly service.
4
Went to this restaurant four times during a 10 day stay in Singapore because it was convenient, but more importantly, because the food was very good, the service was great (really friendly staff) and we were made so welcome. We had to wait for about 20 minutes for the food a couple of times but it was obviously freshly cooked and therefore worth the wait. I would recommend trying the salmon and the Epicurious burger
4
A great cafe serving a variety of food. We had breakfast outside one Sunday and the place soon filled up. My museli was delicious and so was the fresh fruit juice.We also had lunch here one day- trying out the salads. The oriental salad with salmon is recommended. The sandwiches looked tasty too
3
We went on a public holiday for brunch. Food was actually normal as upon seeing that kinda crowd there, i thought it was going to be quite good. Waiting for around 30-40minutes and food was all served together for 5 of us which is good.Halfway, one of my friends asked for chilli sauce from one of the younger chinese server and her reply was: "Please help yourself. We are very busy." Then she walked away. We were quite surprised (in a bad way) with that reply as we know you guys are busy enough but shouldn't someone in the service industry be more courteous with customers and we were polite to start with. But they aren't really that busy either by the time we are eating as most have already left with some empty tables and some waitresses standing around chitchatting. I think she's a student part timer that only comes in during weekends or PH. Maybe not very tactful with choice of words yet.Anyway the place was really very warm and the fans weren't working thus we left immediately right after finishing our food
3
This was my 2nd visit to this cafe. My 1st visit was a few years ago when my friend asked me where to find the good egg benedict, this is where I start my egg benedicts journey. I found online that here has the best egg benedict last time. I can't really recall how is the taste but I think that egg benidict is good (if standard) still the same.This time my friend tried the omelette. Tasted average. I got bread pudding which seems to be too dry for me and I added an ice cream after that as a bit hard to eat although I asked the staff on this. She told me the kitchen said that is always the standard. I am sorry that I really cannot appreciate the standard here. Next dessert, I had the sticky date cake with ice cream. This is much better compare with the bread pudding. Initially we wanted the apple crumbles but too bad it was not available on the day. Warm sticky date pudding and ice cream with caramel sauce, a bit too sweet for me but great combination. The cafe's service depent on individual Some are friendly and some are not, you can feel it when she said impatiently "Aiya..i see what i can do" when I requested her to add an candle to the sticky date as I wanted to celebrate my friend's birthday.
4
Best french toast I've eaten in a long time! Satisfying baked eggs and yogurt muesli and good coffee. Sitting by the river on a breezy sunday morning enjoying a yummy breakfast was a great start to the day! Do visit!

Came across Epicurious while looking for a brunch place at Robertson quay just few blocks away from bella pizza. This restaurant offers al fresco dinning, so grab a seat outside and do some people watching on a lazy Sunday morning.There were rave reviews about their scrambled eggs, pancakes and choco-nana toast and we decided to try them all. Scrambled eggs were good ( almost impossible to go wrong with it isn't it?). They served 2 slilces of toasted and buttered baguette along with the eggs instead of the usual white bread. The Pan cakes were just normal though. Nothing great about it. No whipped cream, honey comb or sliced bananas and i guess they were rationing the sliced strawberries too. The choco-nana was really yummy. Its nutella and sliced banana sandwiched between two slices of bread. Over all its a nice place for brunch and not that pricey. Be sure to give them a call to reserve your seats before droppin by as its a popular place among the expats living around that area
2
We stayed at the nearby service apartment and tried the place twice. Not sure what the hype is about as the food was ok but the price you pay you would expect better. To top it off a manager I was scared to request even the bill from and service staff that seem to follow the example of the manager of being very brash
3
My friend and I went for Sunday brunch at 2pm, the place was still packed, so we thought we were going to be in for a treat: packed = good food. Unfortunately, we were disappointed. I had the burger-wich, and it was drenched with ketchup which I personally do not like, and there wasn't any indication of that in the menu. My friend had the Full Monty and she barely touched half of her scrambled eggs as she found it tasteless and dry.The food is not fantastic, neither is the service. There was this foreign staff from China who came up behind me carrying a chair, I stood up thinking he wanted to pass through, but he promptly just took my chair and replaced it with the one he was carrying. What???We asked for the bill twice, and finally decided to walk inside to the cashier to pay right there. The utensils still had dried food gunk on it and we had to wipe it off. Cleanliness + service, needs a lot of improvement. Food: not great, but it's not expensive
5
If you're in Singapore on business, but fly in early as I did, make sure you head for Sunday brunch at Epicurious. Despite being on my own and the cafe very busy, they sat me on a large table outside, overlooking the quay and didn't rush me. The options all sounded delicious but the baked eggs I opted for, with a side helping of kaya toast, were both scrummy. Highly recommended
3
I went to Epicurious on a Saturday afternoon with a bunch of friends. Food was great- tried herbal chicken and smoked salmon and have to admit that both tasted great. However, the seating indoors looked cramped and it appears that they have done very little to keep it ventilated. If the weather is nice then you can enjoy good food sitting outside
3
Hosted my birthday lunch here. I wouldn't say all bad, but the mojitos were watered down, my friend ordered some wine which never arrived and the food.. It was ok, but not special. Worst thing though is the unpleasant vibe the waiters create. Having embraced the in my eyes customer unfriendly concept of seating times i got in a bit early, and after sitting down i was told every 5 minutes i only had the table for 75 minutes. Even when my friends arrived they kept pushing, which came across as unfriendly and makes a return unlikely. The vibe is kind of cool, but that's probably the only thing this place really has going for it
3
My wife and I had breakfast at Epicurious. I had eggs benedict and my wife had two eggs with bacon and potatoes. Overall the meal was pretty tasty, not comparable to a good breakfast in Seattle, but still quite tasty. The one problem was that the coffee prices are a bit high. My wife had two cups of coffee and that cost almost as much as her meal
3
I've heard great things about its brunch, but after having tried it, I'd say it's only average. There are many brunch places in Singapore that offers similar food at similar or even cheaper prices. We got an eggs benedict and a 'half-half', and also an apple juice. We thought that the prices were expensive for the portions served, especially for the apple juice
4
Was a nice discovery. Location great, easy going, good food, menu not to extensive. What is on it is well chosen and balanced. Best of all, breakfast till 3PM! Great if you came from Europe the day before. However, I asked for the eggs benedict and they were out..... Understandable as I came in just before 3. Meaning you get fresh the next day
4
Liked: The location - outside dining on Robertson Quay. The food - I had a pasta dish with pesto and laksha which was absolutely acceptable.
Dislike: They seem to close early? around 10pm?
3
Always a great breakfast place. Good quality for the price. Service standard that of a cafe. Acceptable. What makes up for the good enough service is the much better food. Try the eggs. Consistently cooked well.
1
My friends and i ate here for lunch. My friend was told by the staff we would have to give up the table at 115pm to give way to other people. That was ok with us so we ordered in 2 batches as people joined us. We waited for 30 mins for the first set of food. Then 50 mins or so for the 2nd set of food. By that time it wAs close to 140pm. The manager came over and rudely spoke to my friend saying we are staying too long and we should vacate the table soon. Half of us were still eating due to their very slow service. After a while, the service staff tried to clear the table even when one friend was still eating. It would have been tolerable if the lady manager came over and spoke in a gentle manner instead of being very rude despite their slow service. It was completely embarrassing and u called for. I would have loved to go back because the french toast and egg burrito was great. But after that encounter - i will never set foot in that place again
4
We happened upon this restaurant by chance as it is situated conveniently along a main strip near the quay. It was the first restaurant we saw to bring a rustic European feel to Singapore, which was reason enough to try the food. The presentation is quirky but down-to-Earth, and the food continues along this theme. I admit, i was skeptic about European cuisine being prepared by an all Asian staff but one bite of their garlic bread instantly won me over. They clearly did their homework
4
I live in the River Valley area and always walk through the area. I stopped at Epicurious on Saturday morning for brunch and it was fantastic. It was very crowded, but I got a seat inside quickly. We had the nutella and banana toast for a starter and then ordered the burger and green eggs. All of the dishes were great. As it is a smaller restaurant and family run, there is a sign that says that in order to make the dishes fresh it may take a little longer, so if you are there, you do not want to be in a hurry. I thought the wait was definitely worth it, the food was great, the staff was friendly. Singapore is not a place known for the most attentive staff, so I do not expect much when dining out, but I received good service and they were very friendly. Overall, I would definitely recommend dining here if you are in the area and want a casual meal
4
Robertson Quay is a bit of a tourist trap, so you have to be careful not to pay over the odds for average food. We have eaten here a number of times and love the fact that the food is cooked to order. That might mean you wait a little longer but it's worth it.The service is polite and caring.No idea what the one star reviews are about. Give it a go
1
We saw the positive review on breakfast at Epicurious so we decided to bring our family for breakfast on nice Sunday morning. What can I say? Extremely hot in the restaurant, even though they try to have fan, the fan is constantly blowing hot air on your face. To make the dining experience worst the service staff was extremely rude. Terrible restaurant to visit with children and family. Unless you want to spoil your beautiful Sunday with the family.I will not visit this restaurant again and definitely not recommending it to anyone
1
Wow - where to begin? We've heard Epicurious is a great potential for breakfast but it failed miserably. Yes, there was a smashed bug in my son's the lemonade, food prep took an hour (there is a 45 minute warning in the menu to let you know preparation is slow), food arrived at different times - while 3 of the 4 of our party were well into our meals, and fourth was politely waiting after urging us to proceed, the waitress reappears to ask what kind of cheese he would like on his burger -THEN laughs about the situation when confronted about the delay. Not amused - Typical poor Singapore service. Sitting outside near the river was nice however there is a persistent sewer smell that wafts into the dining patio.The reviews speak for themselves
4
I avoid the Clark/Robertsen Quay area like the plagueÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. with a very few exceptions, this being one. It is an absolutely lovely place to have breakfast, delightful in all ways. It has a little bit of a rustic feel to it, it is not slick or elegant like some other nearby establishments. Service is not their strong point but we have always been acknowledged right away, so we can put up with it. The food is simple but good, the prices are great, it is a lovely place to sit on a Sunday morning
1
I was excited to give this place a try after hearing good reviews of this place only to be received by staff with extremely bad attitude. The waitress was really rude in providing information on waiting time and seats available. The place only gives 1 hour and 15 minutes of eating time and they will time you upon sitting. Definitely overrated!
4
Had breakfast, and they opened from as early as 8am. Outdoor seating so wear something light. Breakfast menu is simple and refreshing, and good value for money in Singapore
1
the waitress responsible for sitting the guests was absolutely rude when we got there. We had to wait for our table and was told to sit on the bench in the scorching hot sun. Her attitude towards her was so bad and wasnt helpful at all. Worst start to my sat morning ever. We left immediately. Absolutely disgusted
4
Food is always well cooked and very tasty. We enjoyed the Herb Chicken, the French beef stew and also the Carbonara. The menu is not as extensive as some, but what is served is really good, tasty food. Service is good from Janet and always we are made to feel welcome. It may take a little time for the food to arrive but it is freshly cooked and always worth waiting for.I would certainly recommend this restaurant
2
Had had excellent breakfasts here in the past but today was terrible and I will not return. Smell outside was bad and the whole place was dirty. Ordered breakfast and after 30mins of no food was told that they were out of one dish. Toilet and sink filthy. 2 put of 3 dishes were good when food arrived after 45mins. My eggs were undercooked. I would say go to a cleaner place
3
The food is good here but the standard of the food sometime is not consistent. There were twice that the poached eggs on my Eggs Benedict were overcooked. The food is also a bit pricey. Despite of complaint, I still like it. It is a good place to sit and enjoy the brunch with friends
5
Food was excellent, hot, perfectly cooked, promptly served and well presented.I had chicken with mushrooms & seasonal veg, my husband had the gourmet burger and both dishes were faultless. To drink, I had home made apple juice which was lovely.Very friendly service, good value and it's a great venue with nice views (we sat outside in the evening watching the world go by) This is a "must visit" restaurant if you are in Singapore
4
The food was fresh and innovative and the location next to the river was a wonderfully people-watching choice. A view of the fantastical art bridge - the magnum opus of the late Pacita Abad always brings a smile to one's soul. Take in a great meal, watch the world go by and then continue your experience by strolling along the quay side
2
The place has some nostalgic feel of your parents or even your grandparents era with colorful metal plates and the rooster bowls. Cute little place but the food was alright but not spectacular. The service was quite terrible coz we had to ask for the bill 3 times. The place was packed with people waiting in line for tables and they were obviously under-staffed.Wouldn't recommend for anyone with little patients
4
If you are looking for a little variation, something other than Asian food, which is of course to be had a plenty in Singapore then this is the place to go, simple food, at times with a light Asian touch, but cooked really well, great service, a superb location and extremely well priced. a great find which I am sure we will revisit. My only word of caution would be to ensure that you save some room for the desert if you have a sweet tooth, the portions are generous and the food too good to leave
5
Epicurious enjoys a nice quiet setting with a beautiful view down the river. In Robertson's Quay it is away from the bustle of Clarke Quay. Dinner was well portioned, high quality and prepared perfectly. Good simple menu selection and friendly service. Food and wine prices are good value, more typical of prices outside the downtown area. Nice walk up east side of river from MRT Clarke Quay. Enjoy
4
With an all-day breakfast menu and a great location, this is a lovely place to go for brunch. The kitchen is small so you should not go there for a hurried breakfast, but what you get is worth waiting.
5
Quirky decor with a great range of delicious and characterful food..highly recommended.
5
Nice ambiance, good service, great food - a place to eat and relax on a lazy Sunday morning.
5
I visited epicurious whilst here on business. I fancied a burger and someone recommended here! It's easy to get to - just take a metronome to Clarke Quay, cross the river then walk westwards on the bank. Google tells you to walk on the south side of the river as the distance is shorts, but it's actually quicker and much nicer to walk on the north side (about 10 mins from the mrt).The atmosphere is great - its nice and ecosystem with cool music. The service wad very friendly, relaxed and efficient.So, to the food... well the burger was in my top 5 of al time! Meat was perfectly cooked, seasoned and spiced. It was delicious!! Had a great ketchup and kind of Thai green curry sauce for the chips, which sounds revolting, but was actually amazing!Pudding was a warm nut and chocolate brownie; delicious, but was crying out tor some ice cream. Also had happy hour when I went which was another bonus!All in all a great place that is reasonably priced. Would definitely recommend
2
Epicurious is in a nice location, overlooking the river. The design is funky - empty Absolut bottles for water, jars as glasses, etc.The food is pretty good - we had brunch - I had eggs, toast and sausage, my friend had french toast. The service is dreadful: It was a wait to be seated (despite tables being available), another wait to take the order and an even longer wait to get the food (they do warn on the menu that it might take 30-40min on busy days and ask for patience). The kicker was, we ordered a second round of cappuccino and (after another long wait) it was delivered with the news that there is a 75min time limit for the table and we have to leave! To top it off, it was raining like crazy by now and the check took another 10-15min... So, with 10-15min wait for the order, 30-40min for the food and 10-15min for the check, you have 15min to chow down your food...Funny also, that this "rule" apparently doesn't apply to everybody - a group who arrived before us as just hanging out without consuming anything, and that was ok.Overall, terrible service and we won't be back..
4
We went here for brunch one Sunday and the place was packed! Great area at Robertsons Quay so can take a walk along the river after! Small place but funky, water served at the tables in use wine/vodka bottles, inside the restaurant itself has a lot of old items like teacups, plates etc. We had great food and lots to choose from like pancakes, eggs, bacon, toast etc or even mexican and different options. Definitely go back and recommend for a lazy Sunday brunch with a coffee and watch the world go by!
5
Really nice ambience, kind of funky. In these days of Starbucks type uniformity it is good to find a place with its own unique funky charm. The owner Helena is really great and very helpful. The breakfast eggs benedict are fantastic but also a great place to chill in the evening
3
I wanted to like this restaurant, because it's a small operation with a non-pretentious feel and it's "local" for me. There is a good and a not-so-good.GOOD: It's in a choice location in a strangely quiet part of Robertson Quay that doesn't have the crowded feel of the main scene (Brussel Sprouts etc on one end or Merry Men etc on the other end). So it's a little quieter, but the view of the river and the people-watching is still great. The wait-staff are friendly and professional and they're quick to leave a bottle of water on your table without asking. Prices are reasonable with tapas @ $6, entrees around $10-$12 and main courses around $16 to $25.NOT-SO-GOOD: An uninspiring menu that I guess you'd call "home cooked food" if you were thinking of "home cooked" as not really exciting. On paper they look great (lemongrass crusted salmon, marinara, Asian salad etc), but it seems the kitchen hasn't really worked on getting any surprise or delight out of them. The food isn't bad, it's just not exciting.Reading the other reviews, it sounds like brunch might be their thing and they're not really focused on dinner. I don't think I'd make a special trip back for dinner, even though I can walk there from my apartment, but if I was stuck in the Robertson Quay area for some reason and was looking for a reasonably priced "home cooked" meal with nice ambience I'd probably try it again.LITTLE KNOWN FACT: Golden Hour drink prices 5pm to 6pm

This was a great find that we stumbled upon alongside the Singapore River. Outside was full so we sat inside the restaurant which is charming. It is done out in a whimsical European cafe style. The breakfast we had was excellent. Good portion sizes and loads of flavour. Could not be faulted

I came across Epicurious while looking for a brunch place. Thanks to lady iron chef. Itâ€™s at Robertson quay just few blocks away from bella pizza. This restaurant offers both al fresco dinning, so grab a seat outside and do some people watching :) There were rave reviews about their scrambled eggs, pancakes and choco-nana toast and we decided to try them all. Scrambled eggs were good (almost impossible to go wrong isn't it?).They served 2 slices of toasted and buttered baguette along with it instead of the usual white bread. Pan cakes were just normal. Nothing great about it. No whipped cream, honey comb or sliced bananas and i guess they were rationing the sliced strawberries too. Nothing beats Prive's pancakes! The choco-nana was really yummy. Its nutella and sliced banana sandwiched between two slices of bread. Over all its a nice place for brunch and not that pricey. Be sure to give them a call to reserve your seats before droppin by as itâ€™s a popular place among the expats living around that area

Small and hidden away in Robertson Quay. Wonderful dinner menu, great location, superb staff - our favorite restaurant at the moment.

Nice friendly service and great food - the Half Herb Roasted Chicken was delicious.

We had breakfast outside as it was extremely busy. Unfortunately it was very hot. A lovely location overlooking the river and scenic surrounds. Our meals were OK. Maybe the other meals for breakfast and lunch are better.

We went to Epicurious at the Quayside. Their full breakfast menu is available at on Saturdays and Sundays from 9am. We chose Eggs Benedict with Salmon, I got myself a cup of coffee and my friend got herself juice. There are quite a no of people and we waited for 30mins for the food and yet the drinks were not served. Shouldn't it served before the food? The service need to be improved.Two poached eggs with grilled smoked salmon on toast, and of course the Hollandaise sauce. The Eggs Benedict ($12) and the sauce is perfect. The potatoes grilled well. I love this breakfast immediately. I will sure be back again.:

We got a table here easily (at about 11 on a Saturday) and while service wasn't incredibly fast, it was quick enough. I was a bit worried that the waiter didn't write down our order, but his memory was good enough - we got just what we asked for. A nice touch is that everyone gets a few small pieces of banana bread while waiting for their food to arrive. You don't have to ask for water; each table is supplied with bottles that used to be full of spirits, replaced with tapwater. I've read somebody here complaining they still taste of vodka, but I think that since vodka doesn't have a taste, and glass isn't known for retaining flavour, that that reviewer was stretching for things to moan about. I was going to order the full monty breakfast, but if you're a vegetarian it's more economic to just order some eggs and then some side dishes. My fried eggs were absolutely perfect; my wife's scrambled eggs and bacon were just as good. Coffee is also just as it should be; strong, without being so strong that it makes you want to punch innocent passers-by. Certainly worth the short walk from Clarke Quay to here: if nothing else, the walk will justify having more breakfast

I've visited Epicurious a few times now for brunch, and it's a solid option if you're in the area. (Probably not worth a long trip to visit it, as so many other places have similar offerings around SG). While the food is good, and the setting is fairly nice by the river, it's frustrating that they often run out of Singapore's favourite brunch items - namely eggs benedict (it even says they often run out on the menu - so why not order more food!) Bizarrely one day I was told they had run out of poached eggs... they could do fried/scrambled etc. but not poached !! When questioning why this was so, the waitor seemed confused - not understanding the concept than if you have eggs - surely you can make me a poached egg! So get there early if you are particular on what you want to eat, and if you don't want to queue, as it's always popular with expats living along the River Valley. Nice, but PS Cafe probably gets the edge with better ambiance & desserts

I first took my daughter here in 2006 after a month in India. She was thrilled with the homey atmosphere and American style breakfasts so now whenever we return to Singapore we always try to stay nearby. Personally 'm even more impressed by the dinners which are delicious high quality meals at a decent price. My husband likes the place too as there are healthy, vegetarian options available at all times. The location is lovely with a view of the river

After reading numerous blogs on Epicurious, (mostly positive feedback), I decided to pay this much raved about brunch location w the family.Got a table within 10mins on arrival, took another 5mins before we had our orders taken ... But regrettably this was when things did not augur well ... It took like 45-50mins for our food to be served .... While the long wait, we put together our utensils ....Oh dear ... The cutleries, spoons, knives, forks etc mostly were not properly cleaned as stains were still apparent. We had flies that kept circling the table area .... We suspect it's be cos the garden table used were bare without varnish, so left over food stains from many previous customers were still "lingering" on... We were served with cold water in used vodka bottles which seemed cool, but when we took a sip water, it left a slight pungent after tasteI had always thought S'pore took pride of it's hygenic restaurants ... Tis did not do it any justice, in all fairness. While foods was being served, we noticed next table got their orders served within 15mins ... We suspect these could be regulars ... But why the prejudice ??? I feel a advantage of 50% seems wait but 15mins vs 45mins waiting time for food served?? And they ordered similar food as ours.Tough I guess... While hoping to leave immediately after finishing our food, it took them 15mins to get our bill out, this even despite numerous reminders ... How can tis be ??? A major KPI for any food business is getting the bill out pronto so $$$ can be collected and the table can be "turnaround" to serve new customers ...The food was actually nice , not great but just nice. But it's being let down by essential customer service experiences ... Hopefully they will improve ... But I doubt I will dare return cos I dnt wish to think the condition of the cooking kitchen ..

After hearing a lot about 'Epicurious' and i suppose i admit, the name did intrigue me a little. Decided to head down one Sunday afternoon. The place was rather small - had a few tables/chairs scattered outside as well. Sat outdoors as all indoor seats were taken. But this also meant my boyfriend was constantly on the look-out for birds doing their business. He did manage to get pooped on 4 times during the lunch). Not a pleasant experience. The food quality was not bad - fairly average. I had a pasta (which was quite good) and my boyfriend had a burger (which was good but on the oily side. They also served ketchup with what tasted like green curry sauce - not a fan). Honest prices however the plates that the food was served on was rather disappointing - think very cheap plastic hawker plates? The staff were not very attentive - difficult to get their attention. But the waiting time to get served wasn't that slow (considering it was 2:30pm). Tables were rather crammed up - with other customers sitting very close to you. Would i come back again? Probably not. There are much better restaurants out there
