The food court provides a wide variety of food options. My favorite stalls are the Japanese and the Hotpot stall. The food are reasonably price.

On the upper floor of the Star Mall, this is actually a group of different food outlets rather than one restaurant. There is enough of a selection that you are bound to find something you like. there is either seating in the mall, or in the Kitchen area (aircon) and some seats where you can look outside the Mall. This is probably one of the cheapest places to eat in Star Mall

In the StarVista are several restaurants on some floors, but the highlite is definitely The Kitchen - a food court with several meal stalls, Korean, Indian, Chinese, Black Pepper. Japanese and so forth. A lot of them, maybe all, are A rated. It is al for a reasoable price, and maybe everyone can find something. There are also a lot of tables, partly with a view to the outside.The stall chefs are nice and busy.My favorite is the Black-Pepper cuisine stall, besides the Indian guy.Next time again

It's a Food Court, that's it! Good for nearby office goers, its a good stop to get your Asian food fix on a budget. They've got Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, western fast food and the likes. Your usual Tea/Coffee Stall and desserts counter included! The food is decent - quality is depending upon the counter you ordered from. The Korean counter is my fav and at times I go get some Indian food. the Layout of the place is more shady & airy if you sit at tables near the entrance of the court or outside area. On the opposite side, through the food court, it gets quite sunny through the huge clear glass panels.Overall Clean and kinda pleasant. NOT for fine dining for sure.

Giving this an overall 4 star: 3 star as it could do with a few more stalls for a better selection, 6 stars to its - in my opinion - star tenant, Guan Chee roast meats.The Star Vista has some really nice cafes and restaurants including Awfully Chocolate for the chocoholics among us, and German cafe for homesick expats. However if you want to dine well on a small budget go up to the top floor to The Kitchen food court.Here, you will find a selection of Asian cuisines from Chinese, to Korean, Japanese and Indian. If you like Chinese roast meats, head straight to Guan Chee which is conveniently next to the entrance. Here you will find the usual red BBQ pork loin, roast pork belly with crunchy crackling, roast duck and the very elusive roast suckling pig. You can have the all-in-one meat with rice dishes at extremely wallet friendly prices (we're talking under S$5), but with my carnivore teens we always order a selection of meats and individual portions of rice to share
