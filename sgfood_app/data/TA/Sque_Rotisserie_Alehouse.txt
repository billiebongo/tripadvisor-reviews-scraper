We stopped here for a couple of beers after a boat trip, Thanks to a sudden heavy shower we stayed for snacks as well. The food was good, service and atmosphere equally so. This is a smashing place if you are visiting Clarke Quay.
4
An excellent place to eat and drink, great food and a brilliant selection of drinks at competitive prices. Noel & George gave us a friendly welcome, during December 2017 we will return.
Neil & Anne.

Great beers, happy hours most of the time, the best prawn paste chicken wings and George is the man.
5
Thoroughly recommend this restaurant food amazing and staff so friendly especially George he is a absolute gem. Thankyou for helping make our holiday so enjoyable.
5
Food was great - fresh and good sized serves - recommend the Caesar Salad w chicken. Noel served us promptly and always with a smile - he was spot on with suggestions for food and always made us feel welcome. Prices were good for the quality of food. We went back for many dinners and a couple of lunches as well. Great view of the river and atmosphere was laid back but the service was quick. We will go back if we are in Singapore

Sque is situated in the heart of Singapore at Clarke Quay. It is a great location with plenty of comfortable outdoor seating overlooking the river! The service is impeccable, George is especially attentive and will remember return customers. The Prawn Paste Chicken Wings brought me back nearly a year after I first visited Singapore. Now that I moved here, Sque will definitely be a regular spot to meet friends, stop by for a break from work, or to bring anyone who is visiting.

After my last visit I vowed never to return. However some friends were eating at Sque, so I joined later for a drink, skipping the food because of my last experience. I ordered 2 pints and 1 cocktail at happy hour, 1 for 1. My friend was not ready for his second drink so we asked for 2 of the happy hour drinks. When my friend was ready for his second drink we asked for it and were told we had had it. I explained that my friend had not had his second drink only to be rudely told that he had had his second drink. I suggested that I would refuse to pay the bill until we were served the missing drink, and was met with a string of abuse from the waiter. His attitude was 'don't pay then, I don't care'. I asked to speak to a manager and explained the situation, his response was possibly even more rude than the waiter. His final response was 'I will get you the drink just to shut you up!' (verbatim)So if you want food that can't be served as you like it for no apparent reason (see previous review) and shocking service to the point of being aggressive, then Sque is the place for you..........You won't see me there however

Called for lunch at this busy riverside eating place.Avacado Salad - 6 large king prawns with amazing dressing and ripe avacado.Profiteroles filled with ice cream, Lava chocolate dessert (allow 15 ins for them to prepare it).Whilst we were there we had to try the 'Singapore sling'Happy hour between 11.30 a,m, - 6.30 p.m.No toilet facilities so you have to use the communal toilets in the mall nearby.£

We walked around Clarke Quay looking for a family friendly cafe/restaurant because they most seemed to cater to the younger drinking fraternity. We were just about to give up when we came across this cafe. While it isn't exactly family oriented it had a relaxed atmosphere with a good riverside setting.The staff were pleasant & asked us to choose a table. We chose a table overlooking the river.There were advertised drink & food specials for different days of the week. We had some 2 for one beers (good selection) & we ordered beef burgers & a Caeser salad without too much expectation but were pleasantly surprised by the standard. The burgers were nice & juicy with fresh salad & the chips were crispy. The Caeser salad was a real surprise. It consisted of fresh salad, not overdressed, with crunchy bacon & croutons & a soft centred boiled egg. It was also a generous serve. The wife was impressed. The Tiramisu dessert had too much cream & the biscuit layers were quite dry & flavourless. However, my son's Chocolate fondant was well cooked, moist & the chocolate lava flowed out nicely. The side serve of ice cream complemented the dish.We returned a few days later & had a similar experience indicating some consistency in service & the quality of the food.We were served by several staff during our visits. They were all pleasant & a couple were friendly & chatted freely
5
Great position next to the river at Clarke Quay. Nothing better than a cold beer and a plate of Nachos to start the night! Noel and everybody at Sque make you feel very welcome and always have time for a chat! Burgers are excellent as well
4
Food options are great but little dearer in price. Adjacent to CQ metro and Central mall and that makes it so accessible during shopping and hop-on!
3
Perfect location facing Clarke quay for this huge ale house and rotisserie
Setting is average could be improved
Good food and fresh ingredients
Rapid service
Should the setting be warmer I would have put a 4
4
After a long 8 hour flight we did not want a big meal so we ended up with fish and chips and a few cold beers. Excellent service and the food was tasty. Good price for the beers-
two pints for $16.
4
Great place to chill. Good food. Our server Sing Thai made sure we had everything. Recommended if you are around thus area.
5
Singtai was a great help. he always attended to us with a big smile however troublesome we were. Keep up the great work.
5
Decent bar, good choice of beers from around the world at fair prices. Staff were fun and looked like they actually enjoyed their job. Food was good and arrived quickly.
5
We were eating in January 19.th, 20th, and 21st at Sque Rotisserie in the smoking section. We enjoyed the easy going atmosphere and the joyful staff. Heartily thanks to all staff and especially to the waitress Shafa and her colleagues. After 2 month in Thailand we loved the juicy Beefburger and the Margaritas.
1
I asked for a rare steak which I have had a few times here. I was told I couldn't have it cooked like that. I questioned this and was not given an explanation other than 'the chef said'. I questioned it again and was told the chef was coming to talk to me. He didn't. I was then very rudely asked to order something else. When the food came the order was not correct and we had to wait for the correct food. We also never received the water we asked for. All in all very poor service.
4
Nice place to chill for dinner or drinks. Place is not too noisy, so you can still have a good catch up with friends without losing your voice. Good variety of food and drinks to choose from.Staff are pretty attentive, shoutout to staff Sing Thai who was quick to attend to our orders and requests. Happy to go back again
5
I’ve been coming to Sque for the last four years and and it NEVER disappoints. The location is excellent, wonderful for a chilled out and relaxing drink during day time and as much fun at night. The highlight of Sque is the staff, having made good friends, the selection of on tap beers and very extensive drinks offer, the food, their pork knuckles, pizzas etc are fab, location, right on the river, next to Clarke Quay MRT and - I think I’ve mentioned the team.It’s a great spot for local office workers and tourists alike. Great vibe and great happy hour deal
4
This is a really nice spot to unwind with lunch or dinner by the river at Clarke Quay. Great food and good drink specials.
4
This place has excellent food and drinks. Right by the river. The other side of the river has many more restaurants. But I prefer less congested spaces like this one.
5
Was attend by Sing Thai, great hospitality, polite and helpful. Nice place to hang out. Will pop by again.
5
Loved the service provided by the staff who were friendly and informative, special mention goes to Sing Thai who was very attentive and quick with his service! Would recommend the drinks for sure!
5
Extremely friendly and accommodating. SING THAI was very attentive and when he noticed we were running low on beer, he enquired if we would like more. He also took the initiative to offer us glasses of water. Very very good service. Will definitely come back.
5
Am still here with couple of friends. LOVED the embien, and greated and served by the most friendiest staff, SING THAI. THUMB UP!
5
In Singapore for five days and stayed in a hotel only 5 minutes from Clarke Quay river front bars and eateries. Discovered Sque Rotisserie and Alehouse the first night and kept going back because of the good food, excellent service, the atmosphere, the views of the river at night ( right opposite the bum boats' jetty). Of special mention is the service from the waiters and in particular from George, for whom nothing was too much trouble in regard to suggestions from the menu and good service in general.
5
We found Sque on TripAdvisor and decided to check it out for happy hour. Alcohol especially wine is very expensive so it’s a good idea to take advantage of happy hour. Happy hour runs at all different times so do some research before you leave the hotel. We had a glass of Chilean wine each for $17.10. This includes tax. About $8.50 each. You have to have the same two wines. Service was good and the view over the river is nice too.
5
We decided to visit Clarke Quay for the Singapore River Festival and to see the light show with the kites.We spotted a free table as we came out of the shopping mall and decided to stop for a drink. Fortunately we arrived during happy hour & so had two cocktails for the price of one. Often during happy hour (& sometimes at all times!) establishments water down their cocktails but it didn't taste like they had at Sque & our lychee martini & Long Island iced tea packed a punch. we decided to stay where we were for the light show and to have the Friday special of Belly & Beer. It was a generous serve of really tasty and crispy pork bellyWe would highly recommend for a drink and quick meal. Our waiter, Noel, was also very friendly and chatty
5
As i am always love to move around for good cosy and awesome place to drink. I found it here. Accommodate with lovely SHAFA She has never fail me. She remembered every of my visited. She remembered every friends that I bought. That’s warmth and welcoming feeling from a customer service crew. The kind of place that you never miss to hang around in Singapore. Great cosy place to chill of all sort of liquor and beers. WONDERFUL STAFF LIKE SHAFA, not to mention her hospitality. LOVING THIS PLACE!
4
Good place for a short step in. Ask for Georg to serve you. The nachos i really recomend together with some beer (happy hour 😘)
2
Visited last night, had a good seat overlooking Clarke’s Quay...I ordered two small plates of food, one of which was quite acceptable, but the Nachos were truly horrendous.
Service and cost were acceptable.
5
Located in a great spot on the river at Clarke Quay - food was reasonably priced but excellent quality.
Beers and cocktails great and if they are offering the pork knuckle definitely have it, it was superb.
5
First class bar and restaurant. Food is incredible and to say the staff are helpful and friendly is an understatement. Highly recommended
5
As I had been here before the wait staff all remembered me and greeted me enthusiastically. I had drinks only on one occasion but had dinner as well a couple of times. The drinks are always great (happy hour is a great length!) and the food very good. While chatting with one of the waitresses she asked the reason for my visit this time and as I said it was for my birthday she and one of the other girls bought me a dessert and sang happy birthday with a candle on the dessert. This lovely touches and friendliness of all the staff is why I keep going back. Thanks Guys and Girls - you made my trip special yet again. Will be back next time too
5
My family were thoroughly impressed with this restaurant and ate there several times on a five night stay at Clarke QuayGreat views across the Quay good quality food and cheap beer dealsWould recomend this place to anyoneMany thanks to the staff for a very enjoyable stay in Singapore
3
This restaurant has a good deal on drinks (buy one get one free) all day on Saturday and Sunday. They have a good choice of beers on tap. I found the service slow though. We ordered a seafood platter to share which looked amazing. However, they do not clean their prawns at all so I ended up having to de-vein the prawn myself and the head was full of gunk that should be cleaned out. Also, they give you such a little bit of sauce for your calamari, prawns, chips and fish fingers. I had to keep requesting more sauce and in the end I just ate it dry. The calamari was tough. The fish fingers were amazing though and I enjoyed the flavour of the clams. Personally, I would only come back here to drink and not to eat.
5
Found this dis in on our last day and it was awesome. Great waiter Sing Thai was the best. This bar is right on Clarke Quay, great for watching the sights but what is better is 2 for 1 drinks and cheap yummy food. Singapore can be a bit $$$$ at times especially right in the tourist hub but this place wasn't . We passed it in Friday night and it was packed! Great sign.... If a place is packed it means it's good
5
I always choose this place everytime I go for some afternoon drinks and bites at Clark Quay area. Apart from the view of the river and great food, one thing I am always amazed of are the staff's genuine smile in welcoming me back or if I am with my friends. Special mention to Noel and Syafa. You guys are the best in Sque. Highly recommended place
1
Came here today after so long. Didn't expect to received such a bad service and poor attitudes from the staffs here. Tried to confirm with the lady at the bar if it's the happy hour but she was angry and upset when I asked her about it. Wanted to have the seats facing the river but was instead told to sit elsewhere by this tomboy of a lady. The staffs just rushed you with their orders like we owe them a bloody living!. Then a Caucasian family came and the staffs were super nice with them. The tomboy were so very welcoming and even joked about the drinks.. And when another couple came.. They wanted to sat at the seats that we chose and was told that it was ok. Why?. Cause the woman was a Caucasian although the guy was not. I'm a Singaporean and I don't think it's fair that both myself and my partner were treated like this. Don't know if i wanna come here again
1
They were inedible. So tough that even when cut into pieces could not be chewed. Left most of them. When we complained we were thanked for feedback but no credit. How do they have a positive TA rating?
5
Really great thin crispy pizza dough ! Delicious as well. Great choice of beers ! Went on Friday with family.
4
SQue is an excellent location for spot of people watching on Clarke Quay and a light lunch. Happy hour drink prices are some of the best around and the choice of food is very good. I would highly recommend sharing some nachos, with fresh avocado and the truffle chips are great. Service is efficient, welcoming and cheery
4
On the slightly quieter side of the water this place has a good 1 for 1 happy hour at a sensible time between 9 & 11 PM. It also has a daily food special for a very fair price. Staff very helpful & friendly. A credit to the restaurant.We had a few very agreeable margaritas, a couple of pints of Guinness a nice little pizza and a seafood platter that was too much for two people (though it did all get eaten!) for a very fair price. Service not automatically added, which gives diners the option, which is also nice.The only thing that stops it getting 5 circles is the furniture which is a little uncomfortable
5
We dropped into this bar on our first afternoon and kept going back until our last day. The staff were very friendly and welcoming. Noel greeted us each afternoon with a with a lovely smile and was able to spare a few moments from time to time to have a meaningful chat with us. At the end of our day we looked forward to our wine and to top it off the special here was 1 for 1, very nice. It was very relaxing having a wine and watching the river boats come and go. The service was great and we highly recommend the chicken wings. We will definitely recommend this bar to our family and friends
5
What a gem we found on our first day for happy hour all day for wine & many beers on tap, great pizza special on tuesdays where you sit & watch the world go by & whats happening on the river. We returned 3 more times while we were there
5
I have a long list of things I can't eat.The wait staff took special care to convey this to the chef and he prepared an excellent steak meal.I went back the next night and they remembered me, so I didn't have to explain everything again.I had the chicken; it's their speciality and it was very inexpensive and tasted amazing.Special mention to Noel and the young woman who told me about the good shops to visit - I'm sorry I didn't get your name.All the staff were excellent.It is a great location with a nice breeze in the evening in a very hot city.Thanks for everything
5
The day we arrived in Singapore we wandered into this bar and went back nearly every day of our trip. The happy hour specials were the best we found, they had an awesome range of drinks and the food was tops. Amazing service, our glasses were never empty and particularly from Chris, Wendy and Noel. Chris always told us the best deals for what we were drinking, Wendy was awesome with food recommendations and Noel was so great with customer service. Honestly could not have wanted anything more. Thank you!! Would highly recommmend this bar.

We discovered this establishment during our last visit to Singapore, 2 years ago. During our most recent visit to Singapore, we had no hesitation in heading straight there when we were in need of a venue for an evening meal.We were seated at a table in the open but covered veranda area at the front of the cafe with a lovely view over Clarke Quay and the Singapore River. Service was quick and attentive and because we were there at the right time, we were able to take advantage of the "Happy Hour" 2 for 1 drink deals. The cafe was well patronised at the time which indicated that "Happy Hour" was a popular and appreciated by prospective drinkers and diners.We dined on burgers and fries. The burgers and fries were well-cooked and well-presented. They proved to be tasty and very filling. It turned out to be another enjoyable meal. Good food, good service and reasonable prices. Hopefully, we will be able to return for yet another meal, at sometime in the future
3
Not bad, not great. It was standard pub food that filled a gap. I think the best options are if you order a share platter and the drinks deals look good. We ordered the steak and the chicken burger, as I said it was food, but nothing that wow'd me
4
Foods we ordered tasted excellently. The ribs in the meat platter were properly cooked, tender, and juicy. Fish and chips were crispy with a tasty dip. Waiters and waitresses were friendly. Java mini cake was served with ice cream for our dessert.
4
Great location with the river views at the busy and hippies Clark Quay restaurant riverside. Ordered the interesting think pizza, it tastes really good, fragile and crispy!
5
Great spot at Clarke Quay to sit and have a drink while doing some people watching. Staff are friendly and efficient in particular, Arica, who always greets people with a warm and friendly smile
4
So far the best place for happy hour in Clarke quay area. You get 1-for-1 beer, wine everyday (I believe). I think it starts 5-7pm and then 9pm-close. Make sure you come at the right time.
5
If you're looking for wide-array of beers at its best PRICE. Come here. The food is awesome too. I personally like their snack platter and their burger. The truffle dip is not bad either.
Friendly, attentive staff is also their asset. Nice place to chill.
5
The servers were really friendly and tried their best to accommodate us. The food was really delicious and service was timely. I really recommend their pork knuckles. Their pizzas were another favourite.
5
This is my go to place.
Great food, really friendly staff and you can't beat their happy hours on drinks.
A cold beer with food and a view
5
A deal every day. And cheap beer all the time. It's happy hour all day EXCEPT 7-9pm daily. 2 for 1 beers and wines What more can you get? it is right at Clarke Quay MRT station. Did I mention they have great finger food too
5
We have been coming to Sque since it opened 5 years ago. Every time we come to Singapore we make a bee line for happy hour as this is our favourite place on the river. Service is always really friendly and efficient. The out look is relaxing and it is easy to while away a couple of hours. We love it here. Fantastic bar on the river!
4
The friendly and attentive staff really makes this place a wonderful Sunday afternoon on the river hang out. Sit by the railings to catch a nice river breeze, watch the pedestrians stroll past and see the bumboats sailing up and down. Directly across from the much louder and more crowded Clark Quay Promenade, this quieter side of the Singapore River has much to offer. Try the yummy steak bites with mustard sauce with a round of 1 or 1 draft. They have a dozen taps of some good commercial brews available for the deal! I hope one day to see a tap of a local brew like Brewlander or Rye & Pint, hint hint
3
Cheap Beer at Clarke Quay is available with good vegetarian option. It has good envoirement but poor and disinterested service
5
Gotta stay hydrated in Singapore so a buy one, get one free offer is too good to pass up.
Didn't eat this time rather sat and enjoyed the great view of river life
3
Buy one get one free (happy hour) on the weekend, with a relaxing outlook over the river.
Convenient spot for a beer after an afternoon of shopping in Clarke Quay and close to Jumbo Seafood for some chilli crab.
4
Walking around Clarke Quay on last day of 6 week New Zealand/Australia holiday and passed this restaurant. Advertising a deal on drinks, including Singapore Sling, so who could resist.
Shared a steak & cheese on Boccaccio bread, which was delicious.
2
This place had a two for one offer on a limited range of beer, white wine and about four cocktails. I wanted a white wine and my daughter wanted prosecco, we didn't really feel like paying $17 each and asked if we could substitute by selecting a white wine and prosecco as the two for one offer since they were the same price. We were told we couldn't, so we opted for two Margheritas. These came in the tiniest little cocktail glasses we had ever seen, this place must have them especially made for them.Although 80% empty, we waited ages for the bill and finally had to walk to the cashier and ask to pay the bill just so we could leave
5
Returned to Singapore and Clarke Quay in February this year. Upon arrival we made a bee-line straight to Sque. What a great place, been quite a few times and it never gets boring, the staff are fantastic, the food great and very reasonable as well as the Happy Hours – you can’t go wrong. You can sit for hours watching the passing parade – the people, boats going up and down. Spoils you for other places, you just don’t want to move on, in fact we don’t. We spent two days in Singapore on the way to Malaysia in February and then another two days at the end of the trip. Had lunch and dinner there every day. When we find something we love, we just do not want to move on.As mentioned, the staff cannot do enough for you. They are very happy, welcoming and always remember you from year to year. Looking forward to our next visit already
4
Visited twice whilst in Singapore once for lunch and once for dinner. They have a 2 for 1 promotion for beers and with the general price of a beer in Singapore being stupidly high this was a welcome change. Nice relaxed atmosphere and good service and food perfectly acceptable without being terribly exciting but it is not pretending to offer haute cuisine. Also, a great place to sit and people watch and see the comings and goings on the riverside.They also have another establishment elsewhere in the city called the Sque kitchen and alehouse which we did not visit.Recommended
5
SQUE was recommended by a Qantas pilot.Half price beers and really good bar style menu. Good place for mates and / or families. Very reasonably priced and in a modern setting with nice view of the river.Again, great place to have reasonably priced beers (Half Price bottled beers
2
This restaurant is more like an alfresco space. The surroundings are poorly maintained. Chairs woobly, tables dirty and cutlery stands very dusty.The food was basic pub food . a while load of deep fried frozen ingredients. Nothing worth mentioning.Service was okay. But overall cleanliness was an issu
4
Dropped in mid-afternoon ahead of a flight back to London. Enjoyed Happy Hour(s) cold beer two for the price of one with chicken burger and beef burger. Food was well cooked and presented.Location is just across the water from the main Clarkes Quay restuarant area and well worth crossing the river for
5
Visiting Singapore for a few days en route to Australia and found this great place. Happy hour is brilliant and tonight we ate here. Food was delicious and the staff very friendly. Would definitely recommend!
5
This is our favourite place to eat and drink in Singapore. Fantastic food, excellent drinks, reasonably priced and amazing, friendly staff. At Sque you aren't a customer, you are part of the family.
4
Great spot to have drinks late afternoon or into the evening. Happy hour worthwhile.
Food here pretty good and reasonably priced. Good service from friendly staff. Worth a visit.
4
Great happy hour drink specials. Lovely location on the river.Staff member we had was not very friendly and not familiar with the menu items. She seemed annoyed by the fact she had to go check with Chef about the actual contents of the nachos.It sounded better than it was. Practically no meat, way too many jalapeño peppers, not fresh avocado..something from a squirty bottle?! Very little cheese and tinned tomatoes.The menu is uninspiring - both the photos and content. So.. it's good for drinks
4
to be THE restaurant, with its proximity to the Singapore river, and therefore to the rest of the Lion city. The speed and the service, Sque has it all! Did we forget to mention the food and the drinks? What a mistake to make! Lamb shank and chicken are two of the specialties of this place, and we really enjoyed the meal. Drinking beer brewed back in Norway, the Nøgne ø...you have to do it yourself!We stayed at the Sque in February 2015, not in February 2017, as listed in the visit calendary below.Dear Singaporeans, you really have something to be proud of:) Jacob Hansen, Kanebogen, Norway
4
I popped by here after dinner the other night. A very chatty waitress guided me through the draught beers on offer in the later evening "happy hour" and I finally chose the Singha beer - two pints for one. She then walked me over to the part of the outside terrace overlooking the water where I could get free WiFi connectivity. In fact all the waitresses I talked to enjoyed the banter of a carefree evening. And the atmosphere is really quite nice. You have great views over to the other side of the quay and you can enjoy the live music drifting over the water from the bars and clubs on the other side. Lovely place
5
We stayed in Clarke Quay for a total of 14 days in February and March 2017. We tried several local restaurants and Sque was by far our favourite. It's in a great location and has a friendly atmosphere with good food and 2 for I drinks including cocktails available throughout the evening. Staff are exceptionally hard working, all doing their very best to please their customers. We'll be back
4
Went here for a late lunch. Seating outside set back a little from the river, very pleasant. Good menu choice and 2 for 1 on beers and wines. Very good food. I had Norwegian salmon & salad which was beautiful. Very good attentive service. Would highly recommend
5
We went to Sque for the first time march 2017 and we loved it.Always attentive & friendly staff,Great food and cold beer, it is so nice to sit and watch the antics on the river and get lost in time at this cruisy place
5
We always eat at this restaurant when in Singapore, what a nice place to sit next to the river, we came back after our last visit over a year ago and the staff remembered usand are always so friendly, and of course great food, thanks, see you again soon
5
Second time we have Sque & it never fails.
The beer is good with Happy Hour from 11.30am-7.00pm, the food is great & well priced & the staff are funny, friendly & helpful.
Couldn't recommend this place enough. 👍
5
We went to Sque for drinks and we were well looked after
Great service to boot
Thanks
Jason from Port Douglas Australia
5
Fantastic spot to enjoy an afternoon, lunch and a few cheap beers and cocktails during happy hour! Staff were excellent!
5
We went a couple of times to the sQue Rotisserie and Alehouse, and wished we had found it the first day we arrived. The beer is half the price of any restaurant around Clark Quay. At Henry's three blocks away a regular bottle of Tiger beer was $13.50, versus SQue where two bottles of the same Tiger beer cost $12.50.We also had some appetizers which were good and well priced
5
I already knew SQUE was the go-to place for drinks right on the river, but I'm happy I tried some dinner options now as well. The nicoise salad is incredible...I loved the fresh tuna and delicious little fried potato balls. That was an interesting touch. I am generally not a fan of thin crust pizza, which is pretty much all they serve in Asia. However, SQUE was able to make a thicker crust upon request! I tried the Chorizo, Egg, and Arugula pizza and I loved it. Actually, I also tried pepperoni another day, also loved that. Spaghetti and meatballs, too. Excellent!! The only part of my meal which wasn't 100% was the tiramisu dessert. It was OK. I guess I would have preferred a more traditional style. Overall, dinner was fantastic
5
we stayed in Singapore for 5 nights before flying to Australia. we came to this wonderful restaurant every night because of such an amazing atmosphere. the food is delicious wonderful waiters i would highly recommend this place if your ever in Singapore. love from Spalding, Englan
5
Just a few minutes walk from our hotel. Two for one cocktails. Beautiful home style lamb shanks with brussel sprout carrots and mashed potatoes. Prices are reasonable. Service attentive and considerate - they even brought an extra chair to put my handbag on. And pretty views of the river at night. Just go there.
5
This place has a great range of beer and the happy hour basically runs all day. They have around 10 tap beers and do 2 for 1 all day specials. They also have bottled beers and wines as well. The food is great and the staff are very helpful and friendly
5
Location is very convenient just near by my workplace. Superb service staff especially from "Noel" who always take good care of us whenever we go there. Food is GREAT and portions is AWESOME!! Love their Spring Chicken and Pork Belly. Price is reasonable and love during their Happy Hour. This place is a highly Recommended..
5
Sque Bar on Clarke Key proved to be a welcome oasis for us after a long hot day exploring Singapore. Great prices during daily happy hour (that runs for several hours).Food is mostly bar food but what we tried was all very good. The staff that we dealt with were excellent. It is situated right on the riverfront so well located for views and people watching
4
We stopped at Clarke Quay for lunch and had a lovely time in Sque. Our waitress was attentive but not a nuisance. We had salads and clams which were all fab. The drinks were reasonably priced and really great! 4 stars!!!
5
Had a meal at this restaurant overlooking the river in Clarke Quay great service and beautiful food. Would recommend t the ribs they were yummy,
5
Besides the nice river view this place has always something on offer so you can get a good value for price meal and/or drink. I enjoy the place because the food and beer are good, staff are very attentive and the atmosphere is nice.
5
they have 1for1 beer during weekends. Plus the staff are friendly. Food is okay. I liked the pork knuckle.
4
This is one of the best places to go for a drink and some food in Singapore,perfectly situated at Clarks Quay for watching the boats go up and down river and people watching as they go back and forward,The beer during happy hours brings it down to a reasonable level and is served nice and cold.The food we had was very nice too and was well presented.The only thing that was disappointing was the Wi-Fi.I don't normally use it at table but we were having trouble with our flights and had to constantly check on them.I asked 2 of the servers if they could help me but both of them gave me a password that would not work,I asked if they could enter it for me but they said it was too busy when in fact it was pouring the rain and half empty,I would recommend having a meal here so long as you don't need Internet
4
Great place right on the Quay. Perfect for taking in the view and watching the world go by. Happy hour prices are the best we found. We ate in here a couple of times. Good service, gets busy so occasionally a bit of a wait. Food offers are good

One of my favourite places in Singapore to enjoy a cold beer and good meal, whether alone or with friends!Sque has 10+ beers on tap and many (100++) bottled beers and ciders to choose from.Food is good. I recommend the spring chicken.Staff performance is excellent, always friendly and very alert.All that combined with the amazing happy hours (one of Singapore's best!!) and nice views along the Singapore river, it is very easy to spend my enjoyable hours at Sque.And the place is dog-friendly :) woof

SQUE is one of our favorite places for late night drinks as they have promitions such as the 1-for-1 offer till late. Food is a bit pricey though, but the snack platter and spring chicken we tried tastes terrific. The staff are very friendly and quick on service. This resto gives you a great view of Clarke Quay and the Singapore river. I guess they can work on providing WIFI access and upgrading their tables & chairs as I see most are a bit weathered out

We were walking in Clarke Quay to look for a dinner place and saw this place to be packed. We were able to get a table even without reservation. The place is more for drinking but they had in their menu options for dinner. Meat platter, oil pasta and pizza are must and for sharing. They also offer sales on cocktails and beers. Service is commendable here
5
Been here numerous times.. the selection of beers available are incomparable to other places. Happy hour prices for beer apply almost throughout the day except 7pm-9pm daily. Weekend is happy hour all day long till 11pm. So if you are looking for a place to chill with affordable beer, this is the place to be.. :
5
Great food, an happy hour that goes from 1130 am to 7pm. Then 9pm to 11pm, with buy one get one free offers on beers and some cocktails. Staff are very friendly and provide excellent service. Special mention to Noel.
4
This place was always packed out, called in for lunch and dinner, speedy and polite service with good food.
Situated by the river on Clarke Quay it's in a good spot, they also have buy one get one free offers on beer.
5
Went there to discover that their happy hour is lengthy.
Great staff...great people watching....food tasty and reasonable. ..bar of choice on Singapore
4
Even in the rain, the outside area of this bar was a comfortable place to sit near the river and enjoy one for one deals on all draught beers.
5
Singapore can be very expensive for beer-lovers. After extensive research, I found that SQUE has the best "bang for the buck" happy hour anywhere. For example, during the buy one take one promo after 9pm, San Miguel beer is just $5.25 USD per glass, and that is for a large pint (larger than an American pint). As far as Singapore goes, this is an excellent deal. To top it off, you have front row riverside seating! It's a great place to "people watch".They have a nice selection of local and craft beers from around the world, and while I can't speak for the dinner options yet, I did get a chance to try some appetizers, and they were a perfect match with my beer. Friendly service is a notch above for Singapore as well. I have actually become friends with Noel, who clearly loves his job and can be seen going table to table charming the guests from around the world each night. Keep up the great work, SQUE
5
Sque is my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Period. Great atmosphere, great views by the river, great meat platter, great happy hour 1 for 1 deals on their beers all weekend. That's why i come here every weekend. Every weekend! Great crew too, friendly and attentive!Highly recommended
5
Fully recommend this bar/restaurant as it's suited for everyone's needs. Couples, family, groups can all enjoy a very extensive menu. The happy hour offers are excellent! It's in a great location and at night it's lovely to sit and people watch!The staff are very attentive and genuinely friendly.If you're looking for a relaxed place to sit and enjoy the sights, then it's definitely worth a visit. We will return and will recommend to any future visitors
5
Popular place to hang out with family and friends to CHILLAX after a hard day of work. The restaurant sits by side of Singapore River and have both indoor and outdoor seating.The Nachos is our favourite choice to go along a cold beer. But must eat it while it's hot as it will become soft when it gets cold due to high humid environment in Singapore.Food prices are reasonably acceptable and food quality was good. My family members frequent this place quite often. Highly recommended
4
They have signs for Happy Hour most of the day, but the starting price for the drinks is expensive so a 2 for 1 offer makes the drinks more like a normal price. The location is great, service very good, all up a decent place to drop in for a drink during Happy Hour periods
5
Been here a few times before. Once again got good beer (2 for 1 at happy hour), good food (tasty, timely, well presented and good portions), friendly service.So can confirm consistency. A good place to come for a happy beer, people watching and critiquing the antics of the boat people
4
Decent food and beer with no service charge, situated on Clarkes Quay opposite the busy nightlife strip.
5
Although it's not having the nicest view at the are, we tried 4-5 bars/restaurants around. This one is the best with the quality and prices. Definitely should be a higher rank.
5
The beef burger and nachos are awesome! And 1-for-1 drinks during the weekends. It doesn't get better than this!
5
We stopped to have a quick lunch during our sightseeing and were surprised at the variety of food on offer. The food was delicious as was the beer on tap and the service was very friendly and efficient. Good value for money for a fast lunch
5
With only 10 NON Happy Hours per week, it does not get happier than Sque for great value drinks. And NO SERVICE CHARGE! Where else would u find fresh Stella on tap for effectively $8.56/pint or Guiness on tap for just $10.65/pint?I will definitely visit u guys again real soon!Keep up the excellent work
5
Sque is one favorite spot for me. I love their promotions like buy 1 get 1 beers.. and their meatball pasta..delicioso...If ever you wanna get pre drinks or just dine in a chilled place around clarke quay in singapore.. this place is your place... visit them and try it out. Its not pricey..just right for the ambiance...
5
We have to agree with other reviewers that this is a great place to eat and drink. It has everything going for it – we love the position at Clarke Quay, watching the world go by and just over the bridge from our Hotel. We spent two days in Singapore in July, visited Sque on a previous trip to Singapore so headed straight for it on day one on this trip, besides having great food, they celebrate Happy Hour all day, with two drinks for the price of one – great value. The staff were terrific, put you on the right track for ordering so you got the best value and could not do enough for you. Extremely polite and welcoming. Returned on day two and had both lunch and dinner and will definitely go back on our next trip
5
Food:10/10Beer 10/10Service:10/10Staff:10/10Brilliant visit to SQUE! Food was served timely, staff could not be of more help and the choice of beers were phenomenal! Noel and the ladies serving were great! Made good conversation and 100% enhanced our experience.I would recommend this bar/restaurant to anybody visiting Singapore!And it's buy one get one free great service for a fraction of the price!
5
Sque is, without a doubt, my favourite place for a few pints and bar bites to accompany. Been hanging out at Sque for the past 3 - 4 years. The "happy hour" is probably the most generous in Singapore and they have kept prices of beers really affordable, despite the increases in alcohol duties. They must also have the widest selection of draught beers in town. A quality establishment would not be complete without excellent service crew. Always armed with a smile and warm personalities; make you feel at home and it takes only a couple of repeat visits for them to remember your favourite orders.Discovered this place with my then-girlfriend and continued to come here with my now-wife and 1 year old daughter. Also held my daughter’s first birthday here. Great success and all guests were really impressed. Affordable beer, tasty bites with a view of the river. Doesn't get better than this
5
I was staying at the Swissotel Merchant Court which is right next door to this restaurant/bar so it was not far to amble "home". Although there were times when it was super-busy there was never any push to leave. I ate (and drank) here a number of times trying the Pizza (delish!) and the steak (yum). The staff were great and friendly and the second drinks were delivered quickly after the first was finished. The views of the river are lovely and, if you happen to be there at the right time, there are buskers or live music in the surrounding areas. I will be going back often when back in Singas again in December this year so hope all has not changed from the great experiences I had last time
4
Good Location, Friendly Services, Good Happy Hours. Ground floor of The Central by the river at Clark Quay. Great for people watching, too.
4
Ate at SQUE during our visit to Singapore in May, friendly staff, excellent food and drinks overlooking the fantastic Clarke Quay. Excellent atmosphere in an idyllic setting. Highly recommended.
5
When you are fainting due to the price of the drinks around Clarke Quay then you should head over to Sque. It is on the opposite side of the river but has a fabulous atmosphere and great views. They have 2 for 1 drinks before 5pm and after 9pm and we enjoyed a lovely New Zealand Sav Blanc. The staff are fabulous and kept offering water, more drinks and to take photos of us rather than us struggling to take selfies. Highly recommended. We did not eat here so cannot comment on the food
5
They serve the best burger in Singapore.The service was great - especially Dan she made you feel so welcome.Price point was good!Sitting outside under the fans watching the water was a beautiful way to enjoy an afternoon.Great place - would definitely recommend it
5
Love love love SQUE! It's like my second home hehehe. I love everything about SQUE. Everyone there makes it feels like home! Love how cosy and friendly the whole ambience is. Not forgetting how affordable their 1 for 1 draft beer are! So many taps to choose from yums. Very yummy lunch deals and yes.... anything on the menu is absolutely delectable too. Perfect location! I strongly recommend this chill out place for any fellow locals and tourists. Lastly hello Arica!!!! It's Grace here hehe :) <

Enjoyed lunch here- chose inside for the air conditioning. Not many patrons when we arrived but the placed soon was almost full, especially outside under the canopy where most folk like to sit to what the activity around them and on the Singapore River. Service was friendly and fast. Burgers, chips and cokes arrived and were served well. Hubby had beef burger and I had steak burger. I was expecting a cheap cut of steak to reflect the cheap price of $13, but not so. Very tender, nice salad and yummy mayonnaise with a hint of garlic. Chips were hot and Coke was cold. Just right. Lots of serviettes. Would certainly recommend this restaurant and look forward to visiting again and trying something else on the extensive menu
4
I have been going to SQUE consistently for about 2 years now. I love the 1 for 1 beers and reasonable prices, as well as the range of food. They have daily food specials with up to 20% off selected cuisines. Staff are friendly and service is reasonably good. I would recommend this place to anyone
1
Arrived at 9:30pm and sat outside watching the river and the people. Had a few beers and I headed off to the facilities to redeposit the beer prior to ordering dinner, which looked really good on the other diners tables. So I asked for directions and started on my hunt for relief, during my trek I stopped twice and verified I had understood the directions and yes I did. So over the meadow and thru the woods to the men's room we go. I finally made it to an unkept restroom , I mean have you ever been in the Central Bus Station in Detroit??? The bus station was cleaner than this place. So to say that I was aggravated was putting it mildly so I counted my paces back to my table . 125 yards, longer than a football field. We'd planed to eat and have a few more beers but what if the urinal wouldn't do or my wife had to go. So we departed and if anyone knows management at Sque please pass on from me just how monumentally stupid it is to have a restroom 125 yards from bar
4
Went there to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Happened it was happy hours. We ordered Hoegarden beer. The deal was buy one get one free. I was not aware that it came out such a big mug. I was struggling with it as I was not a beer person. But it tasted smooth.Quesadilla was acceptable. Roasted chicken was good, the meat was tendered and my girlfriend loved its skin. I strongly recommended that everyone must order this dish. The seafood platter had various spread too, I love the fish fillets, no fishy smell at all. Tuna salad was good too except nacho's salsa topping was not enough. Can improve this area will be great. After all we had a good times there
5
Havign been to Sque many times before it genuinely became our 'local' we look forward every time we visit to come and spend time at Sque. The staff is very friendly, helpful and welcoming and make you feel like 'coming home'. It's also a great crowd who visits Sque, during the week the office crowed, in between o/seas visitors and some drop ins. This mix makes it interesting and exciting too. Food wise, we love the pork knuckle, pizza and fries with ruffle mayo - yu
4
Good for a small hang out away from the tourists area of Clark Quay. A place you can talk and laugh without having to scream over loud music. Their lava chocolate cake was amazing.
1
Food was ok and everything was over priced!!! They tell you about specials but lied about thier drink specials. They brought us the wrong piza and said that we ordered it.
5
One of my favorite places for lunch as it serves excellent western cuisine and to top that, its by the Singapore river. Ambience is excellent and the staff are so spontaneous and friendly!
4
Happy hour lasts a long time and your happy when you leave. The selection of beers is good and the food menu has a good selection. Take a seat out side and watch the world slip by.
5
Unexpected good. Foods was delicious, prices are ok. Lamb I can recommend (about 26 SGD) and my wife had some cod fish with Pasta (about 20 SGD). Will be clearly go back, when again in Singapore.When sitting outside, nice view on the river and the people passing
4
Overlooking Clark Quay we enjoyed a leisurely lunch on a beautiful Singapore day after a harbour cruise. The food and service were excellent, and in addition we were offered a free drink as a lunchtime special. This restaurant is definitely on our revisit list when next in Singapore
4
We enjoyed happy hour with half priced drinks until 7pm and then walked around looking to have dinner elsewhere. We ended up returning here for dinner as could find nothing else better. We still managed to get two singapore slings for the price of one to go with dinner. The ribs and the pork was also excellent. The service was good and the food was not overpriced. A great meal
5
Fantastic collection of Beer... Right from Belgian , Germany to Thailand and Malaysia. We sat for almost 4 hours , finished endless glasses of beer and very light well made finger foods. Do not miss the crispy fish fingers... If you are in Clark Quay or Boat Quay ( one should always stay in these locations ) you must visit this place if you love your beer.
5
Overlooking the river and Clarke Quay a large variety of dishes at reasonable prices. The tasting plate was extremely tasty and good for two. Add a 1 for 1 Singapore Sling which is available all day and you cant go wrong. Very attentive and friendly staff makes this a highly recommend from us
4
This is becoming 'our local'. Having been tempted by the happy hour and the wonderful location - great for a drink and people watching, we started to come regularly. Sitting at Sque is a treat after a long hot day. The staff is fabulous, very attentive, fun and always up for a laugh. Oh and have I mentioned the pork knuckle yet, oh dear sooooo yumm
3
Had a quick meal on arrival in Singapore - nothing to complain about but probably not the best. Food was a little greasy but filled a hole. Prices ok.
The ambience was a bit lacking and could have done with a bit more light
5
Second time in Singapore and we keep coming back to this place. Happy hour specials are great, friendly service and you can sit on the deck and watch the world go by
5
Popped in for a cold beer and a cooldrink , you couldnt ask for friendlier staff with great service , menu looks great and food was fresh and tasty.
4
The food was great and reasonably priced. I found the drinks were expensive even on happy hour. 2 wiines for the price of one-for example,a glass of wine was 16 dollars to begin with. 2 cocktails for the price of one.ok,I ordered the Singapore sling and they were more like soft drinks. I tried a Singapore sling somewhere ealse at a normal price and it nearly nocked me over! Apart from that food great
4
Came as couple. Ordered aglio olio and a rotisserie chicken. Chicken was good. Pasta was good too but if there was a extra dash of olive oil... it would have been better. The view of the river from where we were was great. Meal for two was about $60.
4
To find it: just walk the waterfront until you see it, it is not exactly where google maps says it is. Lovely pizza topping, Monday has a good deal with discounts for pizza and pasta, other days there are other offers, check their website. Would have been 5 stars if the pizza bottom was thicker. Or if that at least was offered
5
This is one of the most easy going places, real places within the plethora of tourist-trap restaurants lining the river bank mall. No fuss decor, great people watching, efficient service and a good choice of international fare. The salad with tuna is excellent, and the quesiladas are a good choice as well. The burgers are double and grilled to your liking. A good plac
4
2nd visit here in 2 days. Food was great and staff were lovely. Happy hour 2 for 1 went down really well. Great atmosphere and great view of the river and little cruise boats, even better in the evening when the whole quay comes to life and lit up. Highly recommended.
5
We walked all around Clarke's quay looking for a place with a great atmosphere, good food and great priced happy hour drinks and this is the place!!! They have a great menu including a huge range of burgers, salads, home style favourites and their pork knuckle is just absolutely to die for- definitely a must do in Singapore!!!. Prices are cheapest in Clarke's quay and the meals are huge and fantastic- definitely a place not to miss. Drinks are reasonably priced and happy hour is buy one, get one free on a range of cocktails, beers, ciders and more. Happy hours are 11:30am-7pm and 9pm-11pm and all day Sunday. Staff are very friendly and the meals and drinks are always out quickly.
5
The last evening in Singapore we wanted to eat a little bit better than in food markets. So we chose this restaurant which is in a nice place on the river bank. The menu was miscellaneous so we didn't expect anything very special, but in fact the food was delicious and the service was fast
5
Friendly, effective staff.
Good beer, well presented.
Good snack food, large portions.
Good location. Cool breeze.
Happy hour 2 for 1 deal.
Couldn't fault it.
5
brilliant! The staff at this bar should give lessons on friendliness and customer service. A special thanks to Noel and Joe
4
- Good service by staff / crews / management.
- Foods are really delicious.
- The place is comfy and atmosphere is so inviting.
5
After a long day of sight seeing, a welcome cocktail or two was on the cards!! Full advantage was taken of Happy Hour!! The food is sensational and the staff so friendly and attentive. Awesome location in Clark Quay, we will definitely be returning!!
5
Indoor and outdoor dining. Indoor has GREAT air cond. Service quick and friendly. Food reasonable prices. The Spring Chicken excellent and enough for 2 people!
5
Our dinner at Sque was spontaneous, based on the look of the menu and the helpful staff. Service continued to be excellent, with second glass of wine ( happy hour special ) delivered without prompting, and waiter noticing we wanted the bill, rather than ignoring us as the case in some restaurants.Restaurant was busy without being packed like those at Clarke Quay.We ordered the mushroom pizza which was very good with a thin and crispy base; Also a caesar salad which was very large and also fresh and tasty.Food is reasonable value for money but wine seemed very expensive (we ate at hawker restaurants mainly so dont know if prices were typical for Singapore).We would eat here again and recommend it as a change from Asian cuisine
4
Sque is a great watering hole in hot, humid Singapore. After walking in the heat for a while, it is a great place to enjoy happy hour with a cool, tall beer and some lovely spring rolls for sustenance. Good service, clean and friendly. Can recommend
4
This bar & restaurant is in a great spot opposite the bumboat station on Clark's Quay.It has a reasonable range of meals, salads and finger food, with efficient and friendly service.There seemed to be a long-running two-for-one drinks promotion, which made a glass of drinkable white or red wine a sensible $S10 instead of the more usual $S20 for riverside places
5
This was our second visit to this dining delight and the visits were 1 yrs apart but some of the staff remembered us which was a miracle in itself.Arica, Dan, Chris, Bop and the other wonderful people who work at this place are the best reference the owner could wish for. The 2 for one drinks happy hour was very good for the pocket and my hubby had a burger each day we visited and was never dissappointed, I tried a number of dishes and all very good and reasonably priced for Singapore. I would highly recommend this place for the food, the view and more importantly the staff who made us feel very special
4
We had dinner here last night. The table at end row was very good for watching peoples and boat riding in the water. Burger and lamb shank was OK. Red wine 1 for 2 from boomerang Valley was good. The staffs made our night enjoyable even more. The Chinese lady with short hair and black eyeglasses was very attentive. She always walk by checking on us. Other staff saw my hubby hoegarden getting low, he send the second one right after my hubby finish his first. It was a great timing. I considered this place worth to revisit from outstanding service quality.
4
A quick visit for Saturday evening drinks. Efficient service and a great location for people watching.
5
Staff very friendly and helpful. Good food and not overly expensive. Fast service with a friendly smile. HH can be a bit busy but the wait is always worth it. Will definitely be revisiting this place
4
We happened upon SQUE trying to escape the torrential rain, it offered plenty of tables undercover and served an excellent range of food.
5
The food and service were great, not expensive, and the staff were the best I have seen for a long time, so helpful, well done,
Next time I visit Singapore I will be back, thanks.
4
It has good variety of beers and good finger food to go asking with it. I'm a regular at this place and I love to return here every now and then.
4
We noticed the trip advisor sign outside this restaurant, we were looking for somewhere to eat, the big attraction was the advertised Singapore Slings 2 for 1. How good were they, so good we doubled up. We needed a change from Asian food so we chose a Pizza with a side of Squid. All the food was excellent also
5
We came across this place with only a few hours left in Singapore, such a shame as it is far better than any bars we visited during our stay.Great location on the riverside of Clarke Quay and such a broad menu. One of the only places to serve Rose wine as well as white and red in Singapore. A vast range of beers, ales, ciders and cocktails too.We didn't have time to try the food but everything brought out looked good
4
This bar/restaurant in the Clarke Quay area is ideal for a friendly drink or a very affordable and tasty meal. Beef burger could not be faulted. Wine at $17 for 2 is good value despite the name Brass Razu Sav Blanc.Position on riverside is perfect. Friendly service
5
We visited your restaurant along the river front near Clarke Quay in Singapore twice last week and enjoyed great service, hospitality and wonderful food. Thank you for all your hard work and friendly service. We will definitely call in again on our next visit and will tell our friends about your restaurant.Your waitress staff will remember us - the VERY THIRSTY shaggy ex professor and his pharmacist wife from the Gold Coast in Queensland; after downing a litre or so of water we also enjoyed glasses a cold lager beer with our tasty meal. We were in Singapore to visit gardens, specifically Singapore Botanic Garden (SBG)and Gardens by the Bay (GBB) but we also managed to visit the Chinese and Japanese Gardens in Jurong East. There were several sections of both SBG and GBB that we did not manage to cover in our 4 day visit. Also we did not manage to get to the Jurong Bird Park or Singapore Zoo, so we definitely have to return. When we do, be assured that we will come back to SQUE Rotisserie and Alehouse. Dr Richard Whitlow, Gold Coast, QL

I did some research and saw the good reviews for Sque thus i decided to bring some friends from overseas there.Firstly, we sat down order some beers and food which all came promptly that was great.then the chaos started when 9pm came cause that's when HH starts.We order a few sets but the server who took our order got it wrong.(eg; we asked for 4 sets but she gave us 3.)when my friend tried to tell her our order she showed her palm at my friend and said "wait. wait." very rudely.so of course we got annoyed and guess what? the server glared at my friend the entire night.so good food and beers or not we are never coming back.(it was a chinese girl with short hair. please teach your staff not to glare at customers.
5
Looking for a good happy hour deal in Clark Quay, came across this place and ate a substantial and delicious meat share platter and bottle of wine watching people and boats go by.
4
Great location and good prices at Happy Hour
Food is very good and recommended all round
Service good and a happy pl;ace
4
Good service, good drink deal (2 for 1), good location, not overly busy, no loud music. Located at Boat Quay.
4
Great location within Clarke Quay and overlooking the river. Other than being next to the water, the ambiance is average. It's mostly outdoor seating with a small indoor space in aircon. Good beer selection and great happy hour options.
5
My Wife and I ate here on New Year's Eve. It was one of few places that had space on that busy night, but it filled up completely in a short while. They did not charge extra for anything, like so many restaurants nearby that jacked up prices because of the Holiday. It is a nice location on the river where you can watch the boats and people go by. It had very good food, but I do not remember what I ordered. The prices were reasonable by Singapore standards. I would definitely go back
4
What a great place to relax by the river while eating and drinking. We had a late light lunch and the lowest price alcoholic drinks in the area. Happy hour goes from 1:00pm to 7:00pm so had time for beer and Singapore Sling cocktails. Staff were friendly and the place was teen-friendly. On the menu there were burgers, salads, quesadillas, fried chicken and refreshing mocktails available. The bar-restaurant is a short walk from the Clarke Quay metro station
5
Very helpful staff member waited on us, did not get her name, but she was Malaysian and attentive but not intrusiveThe food was good, and the selection of beers impressiveFood in general in Singapore was more expensive than elsewhere we visited in South East Asia but this was a bargain compared to others we ate i
5
Really liked it here. Loved the fish finger sandwich. Proper fish and not like the ones back in the UK. Right by the river. Specials every day means something is cheaper. Beers and cocktails bogof at lunch times. Would eat there again. Nice friendly staff too
4
I was in singapore for business about one month, this place was my favorite for food and price.as the title states, this place makes one of the best burger I ever had. juicy, 220gr double cheese burger.staff is fast, kinda friendly :)they have a good selection of both bottle and draught beer. For draught beer they have a happy hour option. Actually you may call it happy day. happy hour is out of 19-21 PM. it means you can go there at 17PM, have your burger with a pint and get the second pint before 19PM
5
Good food and good drinks. The have to times happy hours per night so if you want to save money order your drinks during the happy hours. Furthermore, the have other special offers which allows the guests to save money. The location at the River is nice
3
The 1-1 happy hour from 5pm was the main attraction we went. Was worth the price and food not really that great.
One thing for sure service definitely need improvement.
5
Have been there now on both our recent trips to Singapore. The service is fantastic. In particular a young man named Noel. The food in well priced , delicious and the location is great . I highly recommend it.
4
This is a westrrn style eatery? For those hankering for a bur or steak sandwich.
No frills, a bit noisy inside, but the food was cooked well, and the service prompt and attentive.
5
Got a great burger here. 3 big pieces of flame grilled chicken instead of a standard burger. Decent portion of crispy French fries with it. And for sitting directly besides the Singapore river it's quite cheep.
5
They have Good view, Good food and Awesome service at an affordable prices...particularly thanks to Mira, Noel, Melvin for taking care of us with our special requests to finally enjoy our dinner date...
5
Whether u r solo or with friends, this is a perfect place for meals n drinks. Affordable Prices, Food Taste Excellent, Plus Staff's Services 'Ichiban' & Good Ambience!!! For sure I'll invite my friends to SQUE when they visit Singapore :-)
4
This is a nice restaurant for families with kids , reasonable price and food is good. Good venue and good atmosphere . I like the area of Clark quay.
5
We dined at Sque on two consecutive evenings during a short stopover in Singapore. Clarke Quay has many, many eateries to choose from and we did a full circuit of both Clarke Quay and Robertson Quay before choosing to dine at this establishment. We were attracted by its location overlooking the Singapore River, by the extensive menu and their Happy Hour deals. On both nights, the place was really buzzing with diners and drinkers but we were fortunate on each occasion to find a vacant table. A little tip here - the front of the cafe is open to the elements, therefore there is no effective air conditioning. If you can score a table at the front near the river or under a fan then do so. Both nights were very warm and extremely humid as is the norm in Singapore. The first night we were seated one table back from the front and under a fan. We were able to benefit from a slight breeze off the river and the cooling effect of the fan, Consequently we were quite comfortable. However on the second night, we were seated towards the back of the cafe, not far from the kitchen area without the benefit of a fan. On this occasion we were uncomfortably hot throughout the duration of the meal.Service was one of the high points of our dining experiences at Sque. The waiters were friendly, helpful, attentive and prompt. Nothing was too much trouble for them.The other high point was the food itself. The first night, my wife ordered the chicken burger with fries whilst I had the hamburger with fries. Both dishes were both very tasty and very filling. In fact my wife struggled to finish her meal. After our first visit, we were so impressed by the food, the service and the prices that we decided to return for the same dishes on the final night of our short stay in Singapore. We had spent a very busy day doing a lot of tourist activities and so all we wanted was a quick, casual meal. Sque met that need more than adequately.No doubt, on our next visit to Singapore, we will visit this eatery again for an enjoyable, casual meal
4
Ok, we've all been there, few days of eating Asian morning, day and night... Time for a good steak or pizza or pasta! Bang in the middle of Clarke Quay, very nice view of the Singapore river, nice atmosphere and really friendly staff, we had the burger, grilled tuna and the sirloin steak, all perfect! And if you love beer, you'll be spoiled for choice. That have a 2 for 1 happy hour. Good value for money.
5
Spent last Saturday afternoon / evening looking out over the water, seeing the day turn into night time, with all the bustle and lights of the area. A fantastic, vibrant location!The beer is good and the service is excellent - many thanks to our hosts and new found friends Lizzy and YC (WiFi to us!).John and Garr
5
Great for weekend hangout. Food are very good and cheap. Yes they are cheap! Ambiance is very good, specially at night. The river, boats and lights are so relaxing... :)
4
Tip: ask for the one for one drinks usual promotion at Sque.
The set lunch is excellent value.
Its location is just by the Singapore river where you can sit back and enjoy watching people going by.

I was there for lunch with my cousin, they have a lot of beer selection, and the grilled tuna steak was supprise me.
Will visit again to try out their menu😉
5
I've been to Sque Rotisserie a few times and this is the place that offer superb selection of craft beers and great value for money wines. Food is good and their staff are cheerful even during busy period. Definitely is a weekly joint for me.
4
We had dinner during Sque's "buy three mains get a fourth free" deal, which was good and happy hour on a good range of international tap beers eased the pain of Singapore beer prices a bit. The pork knuckle was the pick of our meals: great crispy crackling, juicy meat and zingy Asian sauce to dip the meat into. The pizza was thin, crispy and woodfired. Snapper on udon noodles was a tasty lighter option too. We sat by the riverfront and the service was friendly and polite. Recommended
5
Really friendly staff and the best chicken I've ever tasted..have the honey mustard chicken with mash and sprouts then wash it down with a pint of Kronenbourg Blanc.Good value for money especially if you hit happy hour where you get two drinks for the price of one..
5
I am a frequent business traveler to Singapore and I always have an evening meal and or a few drinks at SQUE. The food is excellent as is the location right on the river. They have a great selection of beers and the prices are very reasonable. Apart from the above, what makes SQUE a cut above the rest is the staff. They are always happy polite and helpful. Due to the time I visit after work, I usually get the same waitress 'Mira', who has a natural ability to make her customers feel welcome and comfortable. She is a credit to her profession and a valuable asset to SQUE restaurant. Visit SQUE and you won't be disappointed
5
We would like to say how much we enjoyed dinner at SQUE on 11th June. It was our first visit to Clarke Key. A waitress found good table with a fine view of the lights on the river. Our meals were excellent and the service wonderful. My wife had Caesar Salad with Tuna and I had Caesar Salad with chicken. These were the best Caesar Salads we have had. Our friendly waitress had a great sense of humour, helped us with wine selection and made us feel at home
5
When you visiting Clarke Quay make you call in at the SQUE.One of my favourite bar / cafes to hang out in when visiting Singapore.The staff are great and happy to let you sample a couple of there beers if you are unsure.They offer great promotions though out the week which it very affordable.The happy hour runs from 11.00 am to 7.00pm during the week and all day on the weekends.Looking forward to my visit in August
4
A friendly reasonably priced (for Singapore) river-side restaurant. All the staff are quick and will "go the extra mile" but special mention must be made for the always smiling Noel. Happy hour all weekend and frequent special offers make this a must- go-to restaurant on the river
5
This is a fantastic riverside café on the 'other' side of the Quay with great food and service and a great beer selection. Great place to relax and enjoy good things. Share the snack platter with a friend!
2
What you would expect for American food in Singapore. Fish fingers for the kids are excellent. The rest of what we are (quesadilla and sausages) was pretty mediocre.
4
The 3-course lunch set is worth every bit of its price! Sque has one of the nicest spring chicken I've ever tried. Chicken is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. My personal favourite - the honey mustard glaze. The service staff is very friendly and attentive. They would appear almost right on time to clear the empty plates and to refill our drinking water.One thing though, the outside seating can get rather warm in the afternoon. But when you're with great company and good food, that doesn't really matters :
5
We ate at SQUE a few times while we were in Singapore and we'll certainly go back. The food was really good and the staff were especially helpful. Loved Happy Hour and the crowds that turn up which all adds to the character of the place
5
I always come to this place when I am in the area and I am looking for a meal. The food is really great, and the staff would try to fulfill any request for reasonable modification, they have some favourites which get sold out pretty fast into the evenings, and they change their menu after some time; for now make sure you don't miss the pork knuckle. And their 1-for-1 happy hour is nearly whole day, except for 7-9 pm, but hey, it you are there and you know you will need the drink you can place your orders for several rounds at 6.45 pm and request them to be served as you go through each one, and they would accept that!The place is always crowded in the evening but the staff seems to be always there in no time when you need to place more orders! I appreciate the great friendly and attentive service
1
Service was average drinks were okay.. Every time we ordered a drink they took away our food and drinks menu despite us asking several times to keep a drinks menu at the table. Over-all not a particularly appealing place, good location but many other more hospitable bars and restaurants close by. Won't be returning here.
4
I am being to Sque few times. The reason is because they have happy hour 1 for 1 almost whole day except 7pm to 9pm (peak hour). The chicken wings is perfectly fried. Staff were friendly. The only reason is they need to upgrade their outdoor sitting which rather be very hot during the afternoon which sun light directly hitting on dining area. Where else air condition area is too small. Other than that, is a nice place to hangout when u wanted to have alcohol drinks.Will visit again
5
Stumbled on this trying to escape Clarke Quay, and what a find. Erica was bouncy and friendly, advising us of the BOGOF deal on our drinks. The other members of staff were pleasant too. The food is freshly made, tasty, and reasonably priced. The quesadilla was delicious, especially since the chef left out the coriander at my request! We will be back
4
Stopped here for lunch after finding most Clarke Quay places closed or uninviting. Sque attracted us as it was on the river where we could watch the boats and a few people were eating there. It was actually happy hour when we were there so we enjoyed a couple of Tiger beers, fish fingers and spring rolls. The fish fingers were really good and made of fresh fish. The best part however was not the food but the service from all the staff. They were chatty and welcoming and then when I fainted they helped get me inside where it was cooler, brought cold water and offered medication. Couldn't ask for much more. Go for the service and location if nothing els
4
So we went out to visit Sque with some friends and was fortunate to get there on happy hour buy 1 get one free. This made everything worth while as the prices here are really expensive ie all cocktails $18.50, but with the one free it works out rather cheap. Will recommend but only at happy hour otherwise you will pay quite a bit
4
We went here to shelter for a storm. First with drinks (amazing beer & cider collection and happy hour deals btw). Then for a Nice seafood sharing platter. Owww and a really funny waiter.
5
Pleasant location on the bank of the Singapore River. The staff provide an efficient & friendly service ,with a ready smile both for customers & each other , showing that they work well together in looking after a very busy restaurant.
4
The restaurant was very busy but we were accommodated and we'll looked after. The food tasted great and was plentiful but the service could have been a little better (although understandable given the busy night). I'd certainly eat here again. Enjoy!
5
I have just visited Singapore with my family. We ate at Sque on our first day and liking the friendly welcome and great food, we returned every day of our stay. The menu was varied and between us we tried most dishes. All of which were superb. The cost of food and drink were of an excellent value. The staff were extremely welcoming and remembered our favourites and the tables we preferred to sit at. Even though, they were extremely busy they always had time for a chat and offered to take group photographs. A daily visit to Sque became a big part of our holiday. It was quite sad to say good bye, especially as they gave us T-shirts as a parting gift. If you enjoy well cooked pizza, pasta or burgers (with lots more besides) get yourself a table, sit back and enjoy
4
We love this place, as we are staying next door Sque is becoming somewhat of our 'local'. The key ingredient of their success is the location, you've got a wonderful view overlooking the river and passerbys, the happy hour prices and having Hoegaarden on tap.We also loved their pizzas and chips with truffle mayo is superberb, unfortunately the burger was a downfall.Staff are very friendly and know you when coming back. It's a great atmosphere to stop for an afternoon drink after an all day walking/shopping or pop in for dinner and drink in the evening
4
This is right on the water at Clark Quay. The quality of the food was very good. We had 1 order of fish fingers (very good), a Margharita Pizza, (2) lemon ice teas and a bottle of San Pellegrino water. The charge was $47sgd. We ate there around 2 p.m. in the afternoon. It was a nice break. Getting the check was a little slow, but we finally caught their eye and got it. I would go back to this place, if for nothing else, those great fish fingers!
5
My wife and I frequent this place. It has great grills selection. Must tries are pork belly and pork knuckle, and a very good Caesar Salad. New on the menu is a soba noodle appetizer tossed with dried shrimps and truffle oil which is unique and worth trying. They have very good selection of beers for all day and happy hour promotions. Prices are reasonable and expect to queue especially during dinner time. Arica, who is the manager, is friendly and efficient. The place is both good for couples, friends and big groups gathering. It has both indoor and outdoor seatings
5
Recently on a weekend we were visiting Clarke Quay and our family wanted to try a new restaurant . We chanced upon this restaurant on the bank of Singapore river which had al-fresco sitting. There were a lot of guests patronizing this restaurant and we wanted to give it a try. The restaurant has a great selection of Beers, Cocktails & Mocktails. We tried the Stella Artios draught beer which was very refreshing. My daughter tried the mocktails which was very nicely prepared. For the food we ordered Sausage platter , Fish Fries and Chicken Quesadillas. The food servings were of supersize and between 3 of us we were not able to finish the stuff. The sausages were assorted type and very tasty and juicy. The fish was very soft in the inside and crisp on the outside. It was served with tartare sauce. The quesadillas had ample filling of juicy chicken and melted cheddar cheese. The food taste and quality was one of the best we had eaten in recent times. The staff is quite friendly and attentive. And.. dining by the side of River makes a very pleasant experience. The bill was also quite reasonable. We will definitely visit this restaurant again
4
Many different beer options from Scotland, Belgium, Germany and of course the locals.On draft was a large selection of lagers + Hoegaarden ... nothing dark unfortunately.Food menu covered a large variety of choices. I had the ribs which were quite tasty. Others at the table all gave positive reviews of the food they received.Located right along Clarke Quay, great place for an evening beer & food
4
We ate here twice on our recent visit to Singapore -- the food was really good and the ambiance is fantastic! (situated on the waterfront)Our waiter remembered us the second time (over a week later) and asked how our holiday was going, which was a nice touch.It's NOT cheap, lunch and drinks for us came to over $250, for 7 people, but I thought it was good value for money
5
Pretty fantastic view overlooking the Quay. Service was good and the staff were friendly and accomodating. The food tasted great and was good value for money. They also had a pretty huge selection of beers, ciders, and wines.
5
Food and drinks come quickly and are great quality. The service is fantastic, everyone is friendly and welcomes you with a smile. Overlooking Clarke Quay you couldn't get a better location and there's always a seat available.
4
Good location along Clark Quay. Good selection on menu for all types of food including bar bites. Loved the atmosphere . Staff are very friendly and provide great customer service
3
On the quiet side of Clarke Key, a popular venue for locals and tourists alike. Did not eat there, but good value Happy Hour and big selection of beers and international wines.
5
Price and quality of the food is very good.
Staff is very friendly
Very nice location at Clarke Quay
3
The two nights we went there were 2 for 1 specials on bottles and pints. A good deal in a city with very expensive drinks.
4
Very friendly staff. Location of the restaurant is nice. My friends and I came here for 1 to 1 beer which is very cheap.
3
First night in Singapore and made my way down to Clarke Quay for a late bite to eat. Ended up here because it looked quite busy, the menu was reasonably priced and had a good view. It was 'ok' but nothing to rave about. Seemed under staffed so you constantly had to ask a waiter to be seater or for a menu or that you were ready to order or wanted another drink. Food was quick but average. Had the steak sandwich with fries and honestly the best part of the meal was the fries. The sandwich filling was sparse and it certainly didn't resemble the beautiful 'Asian slaw' as described on the menu. Would not eat here again
5
I have been here a few times and every time i'm made to feel at home.The waiter/waitress constantly check on you, asking for any orders or any assistance. I never have to wave for attention, I feel like i'm the attention!Ms Arica is also a very friendly and cool host. Everytime I see her at SQUE, she is constantly engaging guest and chit chatting. I was surprised she recognises me although my last visit was back in Sep. This level of personal touch is what make me go back again and again.The food selection is good too! They have different promotion for different days of the week. Tried their platters, roast chicken, burgers and pasta. Top notch!Lastly, my fav part of SQUE is their vast collection of beers and also the 1-for-1 draft beers/ales. In fact, my fav beer is on tap and it cost lesser compared to me buying it at craft beer shops.Oh, did I mention they only charge GST? No Service charge despite having good service
4
Initially, what drew me to Sque was the fact that it was right next the hotel I was staying. What made me park my crew there was their great happy hour promotion. Bar food was really well matching with their cocktail selections. Really liked the fact that they had outside seating near the Singapore river. Extremely chill atmosphere after a rough week
5
Went here 3x in our 10 day stay. Great, friendly and efficient staff, nothing too much trouble. 2for1 offers on drink. Excellent tasty food. Cannot recommend it enough. Right on Clarke Quay, buzzing at night. Enjoy.
5
Had a seafood platter and Singapore Slings x2 (2 for 1). Great food, very reasonable prices, cheerful waiters, great cocktails. Clarke Quay is the backdrop for this restaurant/bar and the atmosphere here is amazing. Loved it and would definitely eat here again.
4
Nice restaurant facing the quay at Clarke Quay area with reasonable prices. We had a great meet platter enough for two persons. Nice tables by the balcony .
5
We have been staying in the Clarke Quay area for 2 months and been to Sque several times due to the fact the food is great and reasonable price. You couple this with attentive staff who always are welcoming and get the orders right. The nightly specials are well worth trying especially if you like to meat dishes. Well done to all staff including Kevin, Raj, Noel, Rose and Mila
4
We (two adults and two kids aged 9 and 11) recently stayed at the Merchant Court hotel and had supper in Clarke Quay on a number of evenings.We gave SQUE a try based on the positive reviews on tripadvisor and we were not disappointed.The restaurant has a good location with a number of high tables overlooking the quay, great for people watching!We had a few pints of beers as the restaurant had a happy hour from at least 5pm to 7pm and then from 9pm until close. Two pints of ice cold Singha was $14.80 so very reasonable given the location.My wife had a salad, I had a chicken burger and the kids had fish fingers and chips. All were freshly cooked/prepared and were great.We will definitely be back
3
But one pays for a lovely Clarke Quay location. Although the big Angus Burger is ample, it is not special. The rabbit terrine was plated well, but was not special. The better dishes we sampled were the Greek-styled chicken stew and the aloe vera panna cotta dessert. But 50 sing dollars seemed a bit high for the food even with the view. The staff was very attentive and friendly
3
Lunchtime around Clarke Quay is pretty quiet as things don't start to liven up until mid-afternoon then go late into the night. Even so, this place is open for lunch. Actually, the billboard displays of their dishes don't really do their food justice. The Soup of the Day I had (Pumpkin) was average but the Tomato & Mozzarella Salad with Tuna was very good. I was pleasantly surprised, I admit. The riverside location with people and boats going by makes a very relaxing lunchtime atmosphere. The sandwiches I saw being served to other diners look great too
5
We went there twice in 2 days because the food, service and deals were amazing. First we went for a late dinner and they still served great food at 11pm. We chose to go back the next day for dinner again. The food was magnificent and the outdoor seating was spectacular because it had a great view of the river. The service was brilliant and they treated us really well. Amazing value for money. Loved every minute of it, would go back in a heart beat
4
As far as prices are concerned, Singapore rates as one of the most expensive places on Earth to eat and drink. That is until we tumbled upon this place. Two London Pride's for the price of one ($17) and huge steak sandwiches made this place a worthwhile visit.Get off at Clarke Quay and stick to the left as you walk along the river bank - you can't miss it
5
Myself and some family members visited Singapore for a holiday in August and we were looking around after a day of sightseeing for somewhere nice to eat. Our hotel was right around the corner so we came past and decided to eat at Sque. We were not disappointed at all, the food was amazing (reminded me of home in New Zealand) and it was that great we came back a second time while on our trip. Definitely recommending to others and visiting Sque again when I go back to Singapore :
4
I ordered a burger and it was good and cheap, but very small. As being alone, it was a good place to sit and watch all the busy tourist. Good service with a smile.
3
This restaurant has everything going for it, right on the river at Clarke quay, ambience great, just the food very average. Our mains and starters all arrived at the same time. Good place to meet people though and just have the happy hour drinks
5
This restaurant was only a short walk from our hotel and offered 2 for 1 drink deals during the day and after 9pm. They give you the first and bring the second when you are ready. They had a good range of beers as well as some decent wines at a fair price which is hard to find in Singapore. They also offered daily specials on food. We had ribs and chicken and it was good pub food and a decent size. Service was always with a smile and they really keep an eye out for when you are ready for your next drink. Highly recommend it.
5
Situated in busy Clarke Quay, where in many of the bars and restaurants you pay a premium for location, is the Sque Rotisserie and Alehouse. With Happy hour starting at 9pm on weekday evenings, it's a great place to eat and/or drink whilst soaking up the atmosphere of the vibrant quay area. The food is excellent, with good sized portions of freshly cooked to order meals, and the prices are very reasonable, not just for the Clarke Quay area, but for Singapore as a whole!Beer is ice cold, and the staff are all really friendly, efficient and very hardworking, as this place gets busy! We eat here a lot, and enjoy the whole combination of great food, location, service and prices
4
This place has been around for sometime, but it wasn't until this year that I dine in this place. The food they serve here is hearty and tasty. My group of friends and I order the Sque Platter. This massive platter comes with one spring chicken, a slab of pork ribs, a really delicious knuckle, prawn paste chicken, sausages, mash and pickled vegetables. The 6 of us could barely finish it and mind you, we are 6 very hungry boys. The drinks promotions were fantastic, one of the best I have seen around. The 1-for-1 promotions are perpetual, may it be beer or cocktail.Arica was a gem that night. Her service is impeccable and really really friendly
5
What i like about Sque is that it offers different promotions everyday. My favourite is Thirstday and all day long happy hours on weekends:) Food is amazing too. My friends and I love the bar bites and pastas from their new menu. A quick catch up with Arica (her warm smile) and a good dining n drinking experience by the riverside. I love SQUE:
5
My friends and I had the seafood platter and the meat platter. The food is great, delicious and large in portion. It is really value for money. Also, they have a great selection of beers and it's an even better deal when all their 12 draught beers are on 1-for-1 happy hour. For Saturdays and Sundays, it's whole day happy hour which means one can start having happy hour deals from 11.30am to 11.00pm!!!Definately going to be a weekend destination for me and my group of drinking friends
5
Great atmosphere for chill-out with friends right after a hard day at work. Enjoying the ice cold beer alongside the Singapore River! Fantastic staff and service, especially Ms Arica! Going to SQUE is definitely different without her being there :) Lots of beer choices that makes you completely lost for choice! And they have my favourite Kronenbourg Blanc fresh from the tap! Excellent varieties of food ! Love the honey mustard spring chicken! Must try
3
Always very busy place, good food good beer & good ambience because is next to the river. Huge portion for food, valuable; dessert was acceptable. Only wine is bad experience to me, have tried two type of red wine and both are let me down...maybe is one for one that's why they use really low quality of wine. But definitely is a place for beer
5
Just had a private lunch function at Sque & it went uneventfully thanks to the efficient & talented staff. The space is lovely by the river, food was hearty & yummy + the drinks were reasonably priced (no service charge at Sque!). Staff Arica Chan was stellar in ensuring everything went well - real gem of a person.So besides private events, it's a good place for weekend brunches & after work dinner & drinks
5
Good food and services with excellent selection of international beers regardless of it being fresh and cool draught or bottled ones. Surprisingly friendly prices despite of its prime location. Will certainly drop by for few pints whenever I'm around.
5
Been here since its inception a few years back. This place has gone from strength to strength. It has a winning combination of ultra-friendly staff that made you feel at home, to tasty food and cold beer on the tap. Also their selections of bottled beer in one of the largest i have seen. The ambience is relaxing and a great place to chill and unwind at the end of the day. If you are ever in the area, do drop by and check it out for yourself
3
Stopped over for late lunch. Perfect day for outdoor seating (in shadow though). I played safe and went for the Beef Burger and Lime Juice for my drink. Burger served cold, so much so that the cheese refused to melt on the patty even on a warm day. Maybe the cheese had come out of the freezer just before it was placed over the beef patty. The two level very small patties were barely covered with lettuce and small piece of stale tomato. The burger surface was crispy as if deep fried. The meat had a touch of mutton in it. Tasted different. Totally lacked freshness. No fries. Service was poor. Never heard back from the waiter once the order was delivered. Total damage $20 SGD. Any fast food burger would have been a better choice -- only if I could find the nice river side view to go with it
4
We ate here before our flight to London. The "happy hour" Tiger beer was perfect for a warm day next to the river. We both ate Chicken Quesadillas which were very tasty. The chicken in mine was a little tough and dry because it had been cut too small and then cooked. The staff were friendly and attentive and we loved watching the passing parade of peopl
5
The food is fantastic and the staff were very friendly. The food is fantastic and it is a must try!! The place is just right for drinks and dinners with good ambience as it is just beside the singapore river. They also have a great variety of beers to choose from!
4
Walking down the river looking for something to eat with the family when the rotisserie chicken caught our eye ..... food was great and so was the service .... but the 1 for 1 happy hour (that late!) on sunday took the prize!!! ..... unexpected treat for me
4
If you need a quiet corner to discuss matters or just solo reading during lunchtime, this a great place, especially with daily lunchtime specials not counting the happy hour 1 for 1 deals. I'm here once a week because of the friendly helpful staff, which you know makes for pleasant dinning. Evenings can get very busy, so come early for the happy hour
3
There is nothing more enticing than a cold cocktail on a windy but warm weekday afternoon, sitting in the open with a good friend over light-hearted chatter. That is what SQUE Rotisserie & Alehouse is able to offer. Located at 6 Eu Tong Sen Street #01-70 (by the river), Singapore 059817, the number to contact them is 6222 1887.SQUE (pronounced as "skew") bistro has an open concept that allows patrons to enjoy the embrace of the breezes and scenic views of the river. This casual, relaxing setting allows for a lazy day of simply unwinding and casting one's troubles to the winds. The service crew is friendly as well.I was told that they serve a wicked Cosmopolitan, so I ordered a glass of that. No, actually make it two - I had one more after the first glass. This refreshing, sweet drink was a definite thirst quencher and soother, sour hints infused into the sweet cranberry-vodka concoction.We shared a platter of Nachos - thick, crispy corn slices rich with mozarella, sour cream, onion, bacon and chunks of beef salsa. This was a delicacy that went perfectly with our drinks, and strangely filling. The bacon was somewhat crispy as well, and the salsa was delicious and succulent.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/03/chillling-out-at-sque-clarke-quay.htm

This ended up being our 'local' in Singapore while we were staying at bathe Swissotel Merchant Court. We had at least one drink here four out of five nights and some snacks on two occasions.For drinks and snacks in expensive Singapore this place is surprisingly affordable as 'happy hour' lasts most of the day and there are deals on the beer and single cider on offer (buy one get one free). There are also reduced prices on glasses of wine when two are purchased.We drank the Hoegaarden on most nights and ate the nachos once and potato skins once. Both were tasty and the prices were as to be expected on Clarke Quay. We also had a Singapore Sling once, just to say we had and that was also tasty.I found the pear cider too sweet. My only criticism is there should have been an apple cider on offer too. Overall a great location, lots of good people watching to do and good attentive staff. We will visit again
5
Located just across the road from our hotel on Clarke Quay we had walked past many times during our visits to Singapore but had never been in, not sure why and wish we had sooner!This last trip we were looking for a late lunch one day and their menu caught our eye. We had simple bacon and egg sandwiches with a side of fries which were both fresh, tasty and well cooked. Washed down with a Singapore sling (couldn't resist the one for one) it was a very enjoyable lunch with great service and happy staff. We returned for breakfast the next day and once again it was spot on. Had we not been returning home later in the day we would definitely have returned for dinner.Definitely on our last for next time
4
I visit the place regularly. Excellent value especially in happy hour, attentive staff and a perfect location. Well worth a visit
4
Went to the restaurant with a couple of friends.. They have good range of beers and drinks. The food is good and their service is good. A must go place for either drinks and food!
5
If you want a place for inspiration, good beers and an excellent view of the iconic Singapore River, this has got to be the place to be!
5
Good happy hour deal and delicious platters to go with the beer!! Many varieties of beer can be found here..
4
We visited Singapore in Nov 2013 we stayed at Clarke Quay we were lucky enough to find this fantastic restaurant most nights we would make our way there for the happy hour which made the drinks a good price and stay to eat the food was first class and the staff were so fabulous, well done! When we are back next time in Singapore. Thank You!!
5
Went on what seems like a real busy night with almost all tables taken up. Got our food orders taken and server advised us to not over order... Food was served soon after and we were grateful that she gave us that advice.... Portions were really generous and yummy too! Service was also quick and friendly! Will definately not hesitate to recommend this place to my family, friends and all who wants good value for money food and drinks
4
Was with my ex collegues here in september for my birthday celebration.Besides the wide range of beers, the service provided by the friendly staff is good. (They do have good knowledge on the beer listed on the menu.) A place to chill out if you want to catch up with your friends. (Personally I do fancy the surroundings and of course the one for one offer after 9pm
4
we dined and drank here as a group of 4, The food was not too badly priced (for location and singapore) and went down well, the burgers were great and the service was good, they were always there to top up the drinks. the only negative I would say was the drink menu, very confusing, you order 1 drink and it says 1 for 1 (cocktails anyway) and they say we will bring you another soon...not telling you that this is being charged to the bill, I guess we should have asked so it is not all their fault...just confusing. they do have a very very wide selection of beer though
5
SQUE team really sets the bar high when it comes to customer service. I always feel welcome, all the staff is always ready to accommodate our special requests - and I don't make it easy for them. I've been going to SQUE for the past 2years or so and sometimes I'll have two meals on the same day there. Thank you very much SQUE TEAM!
4
Casual, very friendly atmosphere. The place seems to be always packed, but waiters never forget about you or keep you waiting. They have a happy hour from 5-7 and from 9 pm and 1 for 1 offer all night, which makes drinks very affordable here. Also very good view of the river and just 5 min walk from Clarke Quay MRT station
5
Its a great place to have meals with family and friends. Staffs are very friendly. Over 200 kinds of beer, great place for beer lovers!
3
Great place to sit and watch the world go by at Clarke Quay right by the river. It's only a few minutes walk from the MRT as well. It's incredibly busy at night and it can be difficult to get a table. Wide selection of beers. Menu choice typical bistro type food - pasta, steaks etc. The thing that let it down was the slowish service - they need more staff at busy times, as they were all working very hard. The let down was ordering a cocktail that didn't turn up and when I chased it up they had forgotten it and was then told it would take 10 minutes to arrive - how long can it take to make a Margerita? A bit pricey but then it is in a tourist area in Singapor
5
:Made my way to Sque Rotisserie and Alehouse which is situated right by the riverside on Clarke Quay. They were celebrating their second anniversary and have expanded their seating to two blocks facing the river now. The atmosphere is very casual and lively and it’s ideal for dinner. I tried the ‘Vegetarian Portobello Burger’ and the ‘Penne Alfredo’ which were quite tasty and the fries as sides added to the crispy feel of the mains.Their meat platter was amazing and one needs to reserve a special appetite for the same. The happy hours with the ciders was a steal worth going for. But what acted as the dining stealers were the desserts. The ‘Belgian Chocolate Mousse’ and the ‘Sque Sundae’, as shown in the picture, were top-notch. The mousse melted in the mouth and was quite rich in taste. The usual ‘Tiramisu’ was also delicious. Each of the desserts is a sizeable portion for 2 people. At the end of the dessert, one is definitely left longing for more
4
We stopped by here a few times on our way back to our hotel, the staff were so friendly and very attentive even when it got busy during happy hour. It's in a lovely spot on the river, perfect for a beer and a spot of people watching. We did have lunch here a couple of times and the food was lovely, portions pretty generous and prices really good

Visited here yesterday and the happy hour drinks from 5pm to 7pm were excellent value and a wide range to choose from. Two for one on pints of beer at $14 is about the best you will get in Singapore as the taxes are so high on alcohol. If you like you can go back later for the 9pm to 11pm session also! They have various offers on food depending on the night you visit. It's a good location to people watch and handy for the station. Most impressed with the staff who were all efficient yet had a sense of humour and happy to have a chat with you, unlike some places. Would definitely recommend

I haven't explore much in Singapore, but this place will be the one that I always come to visit when I'm in Singapore. The waiter and waitress there are friendly and nice. The location is not far from Orchard and there are mrt nearby which make this place a very convenient to drop by. Overall, I would recommend to everyone to visit this bistro

I went there with my husband one Sunday earlier this year for a light brunch. It was a great start to our Sunday. The service was prompt and warm, and the food just to our taste. We will definately make our way there again one evening for a full meal and beers

Been there a couple of times with group of friends.Great place for beer lovers as they have a wide selection of beers. But I like their wines as well... haha..Some of their food that I really like : Clams, Sque platters, sausages, truffle fries and apple crumble :)Price are reasonable given the location and for alcholic drinks, their happy hour promo are super cheap!Great place for after-office hour drinks and also gathering

Situated on the quieter side of Clarke Quay, this bar hiding behind a rotisserie is a one-of-a-kind hidden gem. Stocking up a humongous selection of beers (over 200 I am told) and the food menu does change a little, makes you want to keep coming back to try something different! The unique long outdoor layout does have its cons (a wee bit of effort needed to gain the attention of the serving staff and more often than not the general public noisily walking by does distract) but if you're seated on the high tables and seats located nearer the river, you're in a great position to people watch and beyond that the serenity of the river at times sets the perfect mood to reflect on life. Recommended as a wind down place after a hectic workday or week

Great ambience, friendly service and great deals on the many drinks that they have!! Draught beers a real steal with the happy hour promotion!!

Great 1 for 1 deal during happy hours which is almost all day long! Best deal along Clark Quay for great draught beers / ales / ciders

I regularly visit the bar/restaurant given its proximity to my office. We always manage to get a table and if they are all full the bar staff provide one as soon as possible, and keep us well refreshed in the meantime.The staff are professional and attentive and you never have to wait long. The managers do a good job to keep the service high given the high level of turn over in staff (of course not abnormal in this industry). The staff are well informed on beers on offer, special offers on drinks.Food is served quickly, always hot and freshly prepared and given competition in the area and large menu served I think it is right up there.Think suitable for all occasions apart from sometimes when it is swelteringly hot it does suffer from lack of shade.I have no hesitations in reccomending this place

Sprawled out over three shoplots and offering both indoor air conditioned and al fresco dining, it's a great place for a gathering among friends. Menu consists of full wholesome meals and finger foods to pass around over chats and lazy afternoon gossips. Love its location by the Singapore River where you can idyllically watch tourist boarding ferries for river ride ; time can pass by faster than you realise

On Clarke Quay next the Singapore River. We stopped to get out of the heat of the day, find a loo and have a light meal before a bumboat trip round the River and Marina. The beer was excellent as was my beef sandwich. Seemed to be popular with discerning business types bringing clients for a light bite and drink. Well woth checking out

Was walking around on a late Sunday afternoon near Clarke Quay and this was right next to the Singapore river. Had a 1+1 drink throughout the day with a great collection of beer. A perfect place for a afternoon drink with the family and their food was equally amazing

Nice place to chillout with friends or family. Has both indoor and outdoor seating. Restaurant is located right oppositive Clarke Quay, with the river running in between. Has a great selection of bar food and proper main courses. Because of the outdoor seatings, nice to place to hangout for brunch and later in the evening.. enough room for kids to run around too. Sque is located on the outer side of The Central Mall and with Clarke Quay MRT station below

We dined and drank at the Sque 6 times over a two week period. After the second visit the waiters recocognized us and remembered our prior orders.Food was excellent and prepared in a very timely masnner. Service fantastic.Best part were the viryual all day happy hours, two for one or half price, depending on what you ordered. Highly, highly recommended

Gotta like this place, affordable booze n food right on the Singapore river at Clarke quay, 2 tigers for 12 bucks, try to beat that in Singapore, ambiance pleasant, staff great, outlook onto the river as good as it gets, nice way to spend an hour or so. Great service, as for Chrisneoh69 who wrote an earlier review, be real, you thought a pub on the river in Singapore was a good choice for your kids, suggest you takes your kids to places they enjoy and then you may enjoy the places that they shouldn't be, place was pretty good

The Sque in Clarke Quay offer's great value happy hour.From 11.30am to 7.00pm you get 2-1 on selected beers.Great place to enjoy cold beer in the heat of Singapore and watch the world go bye.Did not suffer from bad service during my visit.Would highly recommend
