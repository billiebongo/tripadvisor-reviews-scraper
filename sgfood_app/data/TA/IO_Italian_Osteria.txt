Nothing much to say as everything about this place is fantastic!
Me and my husband always come here to enjoy exquisite Italian food.

The food is very good. Especially the braised beef. Just loved it.
Waiters were friendly but didn't have much time. It was so busy. It's a very nice place but it can be a little bit too loud.

This place is a casual but very nice place for some good Italian food.We had some shared starters that were delicious. The Pasta was a bit small portion but taste was very good.Definitely a place to go if you live close to Hillview. If not, maybe not worth the whole trip
5
Located outside town area at Hillview area. Very authentic Italian home cook style restaurant. Bruschetta with sautéed mushrooms / stracchino cheese and ham must eat, Porchetta baked pork belly with fennel, seafood spaghetti , baked sea salt seabass is lovely. Very friendly and attentive waiter and waitress. Casual ambience and reasonable price.

Located in a central mall of a new housing development, iO is a large Italian restaurant decorated with post-modern industrial feel. The place is quickly filled up like a canteen. The menu certainly looks interesting with choices of pasta that I could barely pronounce. The kitchen is efficient and the quality of cooking is decent but $50 per head is a bit high for a canteen though
5
First time there with my family of 7adults and 3kids. Had the best authentic Italian food. my kids love the pasta and pizzas. They also love the dessert. Nice ambience for family gathering and worth to go for a romantic dinner too. Great service served by the staff with warm smiles! Will visit the restaurant again to try the rest of the menu. Thank you so much for the great experience
5
My family had a marvellous time in dining at Italian Osteria. It was a great place and the ambience was great. The food was superb, my kids enjoyed eating the pizzas and dessert. An excellent service from the staff there whom were friendly, attentive and knowledge. So far this is the best authentic Italian restaurant in town. Love the place a lot
4
Grilled seafood was a wonderful spread and of great, fresh taste!Beef stew was a disappointment, mashed potato was more like the hero of the dish.Roasted pork with fillings is probably not my cup of tea, I still prefer the Chinese style with crackling skin
5
Italian restaurants are everywhere in Singapore but not all of them are THAT good. We have been to IO for at least 5 times and the quality of food and the service is very consistent. When we were waiting for our friends, one waiter came and asked if we wanted to order something for our kids first. So we ordered the penne with ragù and it was delicious. We had la porchetta which we always order and it never disappoints. We also had the home made faccacia bread, the daily special of waygu beef with polenta (the guys enjoyed it but I wasn’t impressed by it), the rolled up pasta with broccoli and cheese (it was okay) and the branzino baked in salt crust which was an absolute delight. I would return just for the branzino!In our previous visits, we had the deep fried seafood and pizza and they were fantastic as well. Goes without saying, the gelato is wonderful but all the cakes on display aren’t exactly authentic italian. We always live buying a few biscotti in the way out as they are so yummy. The atmosphere is always buzzing in IO and it’s always so busy. Even though the tables are very close to each other and it’s slightly cramped, it’s sill a wonderful place to dine in with families or friends.
4
Good as always and authentic Italian fare.Instead of the truffle bread, we went for the roasted pork belly, which was very good with the fennel and mustard.The lasagna and the orichette were also very delicious. It was an early dinner for us, so we practically had the restaurant to ourselves
5
Visited the IO in Singapore twice last month and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The pepperoni pizza was the best I've ever eaten. The tiramisu too is highly recommended besides the other dishes and desserts.

This place has earned much praise so I don’t I need to add in much more.
Some tips.... get their in house sparkling water (I never liked sparkling water excepts theirs) and their in house by the glass red wine in particularly Sangiovese

One of the best pizzas around and reasonably priced food. Very authentic, a number of the team here also seems to be Italians. The Truffle Mushroom Sausage Pizza is a must order! A small pizza is already 4 slices. The rest of the food like the Roast chicken, pasta and Lasagna were slightly above average. Desserts are generally good. The homemade Espresso Gelato is superb! So was the Pistachio Tiramisu, love the scent of Nutty Pistachio which didn't spoil the taste of a typical tiramisu base at all. This is by far the only place I know of that offers this. Service system is by server-table, so when we wanted to order, we couldn't just get the attention of the nearest service staff but they had to get the right person assigned to this table to take our order. I also didn't like that they didn't have the full menu offering on the printed piece. The pizzas and some of the desserts were written on the chalkboard which was kind of troublesome as we were seated away from it and the restaurant was very crowded. Location is alittle off from central. Reservations are a must, at least on weekends and public holidays.
4
Had salt-baked Seabass fish (comes w salad), the meat special (pork ribs), usual burrata cheese w parma ham, and panettone.Must say the dessert offerings on a weekday is less spectacular than the weekends. Nonetheless, i never miss trying. Panettone is a Christmas fruit loaf cake served with vanilla ice-cream.Advice you to book on a weekday where you get faster and more attentive service from the waiters.Super yummy! It never fails me
5
Had a great salad, pizza, pasta and tiramisu. Porchetta was also fantastic. We had a great meal at an affordable price. Be sure to get a reservation because it tends to get crowded on weekends. Parking is difficult to find - I suggest going to the valet (it is free
5
We ordered blatter cheese salads, assort pizza (M size)and pork berry with fennel(S size) and todayâ€™s special pasta for 4 person Volume of fish was just nice size for 4 person.Quality and service has been stable. In this time, waiter led me to wind tabl
5
An imaginative Italian menu with some excellent specials and a wide variety of wines. we were dining with some locals otherwise I'm sure that we would never have come, it's a bit out of the way and as I say, it is a neighbourhood thing. I ate a pumpkin risotto which was cooked to perfections, I forget exactly what others had but we all enjoyed what was put in front of us. The restaurant is fairly small with high ceilings, giving it a very open feel. The kitchen is on display and I will commend the excellent service. I wish that I had the Osteria around the corner from my house
5
We had a great time at iO celebrating my husband's birthday. Made a reservation online and we were seated promptly and served by Raj (hope i got his name right). He was very helpful in helping us place our orders, gave great suggestion regarding food potion for our family. Hubby was disappointed that the menu did not have carbonara and when we checked with Raj, he cheerfully said he would check with the chef if he could whip up a plate for the hubby. Awesome service. The food was great, we ordered roman schiacciata (truffle), porchatta, crispy fried seafood, roasted chicken, carbonara and grilled seafood. Everything was great, especially the rs and porchatta
4
we had the steak which everyone love, the braised beef was really yummy being so tender. we tried their bread (cant rem the name) which was amazingly soft and flavourful.. round off with tiramisu and panna cotta which you cant go wrong with. their mushroom soup is really pure mushrooms.. not the creamy type.as they practice 2 seating over weekends, the service staff were a bit curt when i asked questions and couldnt wait to go. service was prompt but harried. we spent over 200 for 5 pax.
5
I have not been to Italy. But I would highly recommend this place, as it seems really Italian to me! Stuffed roman stacchiata and baked eggplant is the winner (for vegetarians), and the best dessert is pistachio tiramisu! Ambience is nice and rustic too. This place is always packed, so do make a reservation before coming down! You can buy bread home too, their bread/pizza looks fantastic
4
Located at hillview area (upper bukit timah) this reataurant dervrs delicious pizza and good selection of italian street food. Price is reasonable and service friendly. Make sure you make reservations especially on fridays and weekends. Ambience is nice but can get noisy during peak periods.
5
Food was great. Authentic italian. Service was fantastic. Responsive service. Polite staff. Ambience ok. Value for money too.
4
Enough said about how good this restaurant so i better write about the food itself i ordered a serving of bread ($6) as starters and they come in different forms and you get different oils to dip eg olive oil, chilli oil etc. i ordered a small size seafood grill ($26) and it was one of the seafood grill i had (benchmarking against the grill i have had living in Melb )!Cheap or best is relative depending what your benchmark is or how deep your pockets. i would not say it is cheap eating for singaporeans so it is not a weekly affair for most of us eating here or elsewhere in hillview as in the chili crab place up the road . Bon appetite 
4
Great Italian food with a nice view. We tried the pizza which comes in 4 variety, pork belly (sinful) and some eggplant in cheese. The portion was just nice for 4 paxs and the taste and preparation were nicely done. Top that up with a tiramisu and wow
5
The restaurant has an open space concept and is good for casual occasions and group gatherings. Ordered the pork knuckle, baked eggs and pasta. Every dish was very tasty! The tiramisu dessert ended our meal perfectly. Price is reasonable. I would certainly recommend this place to Italian food lovers
3
Easy enough to get to the mrt is about 5-10 minutes walk. The restaurant decor is nice, they have lovely bread as they bake it there. I tried their sparkling house white wine and my husband had their house red which is cheap enough but it's not very nice. The food was mediocre and the service was nothing to brag about. Would I go there again no as we have another Italian restaurant which we prefer the is much better all round
5
Hillview is the new old place. The MRT Blue line will deliver you almost to the door. It is definitely worth the journey. This place is very authentic Italian. If you need to know more than that, well just get there and try it. Best advice is to order from the specials board and ask your waiter for advice. Good wines at reasonable prices. Also have good vegetarian options. Love i
5
I couldn't be more satisfied with the service and food at Io Osteria. The food is authentic and served in a polite manner. The food and service is better than most restaurants in Italy that I've been to. Yes, it's no exaggeration. I will always eat here! 100/10
1
What do you do when they show you to a table in a very uncrowded restaurant and thereafter ignore you. No water, no explanation of what the specials are, nothing. And you have staff at the bar talking and fiddling with their phones.We left, with no interested as to why. Beware this place. Lousy, totally disinterested service
4
Back here for the 2nd time, to try different dishes. Had the roast pork belly, pizza & pork sausage pasta this time. Food was good, portions were just nice, and prices reasonable (except for the wines). It was a bit noisy though & the tables are placed quite close together. Best to come with a group of friends, so you can order more dishes to share and enjoy the casual vibe. Tip: best to make a reservation in advance as the place was packed for a mid-week dinner.
5
Judging by the setting of the place, I'd expect pricey small portions. However, the osteria had generous yet delicious servings. Their service was good too -- attentive and willing to help us toast some bread.
5
It felt like we were back in Italy, Great food using fresh Italian ingredients and it was a real buz to have Italian waiters and chefs. Very Very authentic Italian
5
This is as good if not better than many restaurants we've eaten at in Italy. And that's not surprising as this place is full of Italian staff.It's well worth the trip to the top of Upper Bukit Timah Rd and parking is easy underneath Hillview Rise.Ambience is good for dining with family and friends, probably not for a quiet romantic meal with a loved one.We enjoyed beef carpaccio, burrata and bruschetta starters, and pork orecchiette, and pasta specials. Our 8yo loved the plain penne tomato that we asked for (not on the menu), great the kitchen was accommodating, and to be fair it was excellent and probably the dish of the night! Nice deli and reasonable priced wine list. We'll be back to try the rest of the menu
5
I love the ambience, staff and food of iO Osteria. We will come and visit the restaurant at least once a month from the start when it opened. They always welcome us with a big smile!The food is delicious. Love the main menu but am also really impressed with the specials. It can be very busy so best to make a reservation
5
I have never been disappointed with the food and service. Food is cooked by Italians which makes it as authentic as it can. Orders are taken by Italians (most of the time) which do a good job of explaining the dishes which are not familiar with or not on the menu. Prices are somewhat reasonable by this standards. Highly recommended to try if you have not been there but make sure you book on peak hours
4
What a gem. The food was so flavourism, quickly and well presented. We ordered a number of the entrees and enjoyed sharing the wealth of flavours and textures. The food arrived promptly in generous servings. The staff were attentive helping to make our visit very enjoyable . Certainly worth a visit.
4
IO Osteria is an usual restaurant by Singapore standards on several counts, most of them positive. First, it's largely staffed in the kitchen with what appear to be Real Italians (though they could be Ukranians with fake accents who did Jamie Oliver cooking classes online!). The food is very tasty and affordably priced. Second, it's in a satellite shopping mall which presumably keeps the rent (and the prices) down. Third, the philosophy is to pack the patrons close together, take orders in a hurry, serve the food fast and free that table up for the next patrons. It's a loud setting which sort of reminds me of Hong Kong dimsum on Sunday mornings. The menu is fairly simple, all the dishes are good and the house wine is fairly priced and drinkable. Recommended
4
iO Italian is a lovely casual neighbourhood restaurant. This is perhaps one of our "go-to" restaurants for consistency good Italian food in Singapore. The atmosphere is wonderful, and feels just like a real Italian trattoria. Service was attentive and we were well looked after and during our meal. FYI, Four stars is my high rating
4
The food here is outstanding and greta value for money .It is a family run restaurant but is now so popular it doesn't really have that Hom,ely Italian feel anymore .It has become very popular and a bit crowded .The tables are very close together that you do feel that you are sharing dinner with those at the next table That sai the food is excellent and I will return for sur
5
I just had lunch at this fabulous restaurant. Its location may put you off if you don't live locally but make the effort, it will be worth it. The menu was varied and catered well for both the vegetarians and carnivores in our party. We shared a few starters and every mouthful was delicious. The presentation, the temperature, the flavours... all exactly as they should be. Our mains were equally delightful and the best part... everyone was served together! The service was faultless and attentive without being intrusive. I can't wait to go back
4
Food was well done! Everything tasted just right and would leave you savoring the rich flavors long after you've left. My only suggestion is to allow more time for guests to enjoy their meals and have more vegetarian options.
5
Excellent italian restaurant with an incredible good service. The wines are great, the bread fresh and cross and the food delicious. The deserts are a dream. Best: you feel like in Italy!
5
The staff is super friendly and helpful. The location is more accessible now that there is a MRT station nearby. It is definitely worth the trip. The menu changes every Friday when they create new specials, depending on the seasonal availability of produce, meat and fish. It is a treat and an education to hear the waiter describe the specials. The desserts also change regularly, so it is worth passing the dessert cooler to see what's new before sitting down to order. The cuisine is authentic, and takes inspiration from many different regions of Italy. The Italian staff eats there too, so you know the food must be good
4
Pleasantly surprised to see an authentic Italian in quiet Hillview. The pizzas and roasted chicken were all on-point. After the meal, my friends all said they would bring their families here - the best type of referral. This was a visit for lunch so it was not too crowded for no-wait service
4
That's a good Italian, pizze, pasta, starters...The place looks nice, a bit noisy/echo-y though.Staff are nice. Good service. The prosecco is very sweet. Not the best we had. Wine housepour, good value for money. It is far from singapore city center. I am not sure if I will go back to this area only for the food, but if I am around I will.
5
Although located in a remote part of Singapore, the place is still packed every weekend. Reservations are a must. Luckily, we live nearby and eat here every 2 months because...1) Burrata is awesome. Get the large portion which is enough for 4-6, not the small starter portion listed on the menu. The burrata with parma ham cherry tomatoes and rucola complement each other with light cheese salty sweet bitter flavours all at the same time. It's our gold standard to measure against other burratas.2) Try the Specials. Of course we like their Assorted pizzas and Grandma's lasagna. Everyone has their favourites and honestly not every Special is great. Yet we love hearing the staff describe them and we learn a little more about Italian cuisine each time. Specials are what makes Osteria different.3) Great place to celebrate an occasion like graduation or to bring friends you haven't seen for a while. They may be impressed by the lubang. Too noisy to sing birthday songs though. Overall good vibes
4
Informal, convivial setting with a bakery upfront, this Osteria has been well recommended by people who tried their breads and pastas. Most memorable items included: Porchetta (A) crispy, moist roast pork with stuffing; Ligurian pasta with Calamari (B+), Stuffed Roman Schicciatta bread (A-; possibly plain is less filling), Pappardelle di Manzo (B, a bit too oily). Portions are huge; pastas are al dente. Corkage is $30

came here for our wedding anniversary and first impressions were good - a crowded restaurant packed with people bustling with energy and friendly staff. Where the appetizers came, the experience started to head south, food tasted average, in parts bland, and hinted at food coming off a mass production line. before all my appetizers came, they served the mains??? i decided to cancel my remaining appetizers. Our pastas were definitely tough and likely undercooked, pasta was also very thick and most stuck together (see pic), again it was bland to taste and i wanted to stop after the first bite. Sadly this place is not going to be on my return for meal list
5
probably my 5th or 6th visit in the last 6 months and this shining gem in the very dull western part of SG never fails to leave me fully satisfied with their food and service.came here a few times with some Italian friends from different regions and all of them "certified" this place authentic while they say some dishes are prepared on purpose more "localised" and "sophisticated" but still enjoy it anyhow.their mamma mia-licious yet affordable food and mouth-watering weekly specials on their Facebook page are keeping me coming back for more
3
The owner/chef takes care of all the aspects to maintain as much as possible the touch of Italy; the personnel, the ingredients, the wines & beers, some fo the hand-made breads, the recipes......almost all come from Italy. IO is known and very crowdy: so reservation is recommended. The food was also nice, maybe too much "sophisticated", but tasteful.But there are at least two negative points: the first is the price, surely high...a 0,75 beer can hardly cost 48 S$.The second is the room: the restaurant is one among many others, facing a fake alley (outside the restaurant you are not on the ground, but on the second floor slab of a Commercial Centre...); all the space has been filled with tables and once you are seated is difficult to leave your chair; moreover there is no internal restroom, so, if only to wash your hands before dining, you are forced to search for the Commercial Centre only toilets, located in another block; well, a customer who is prepared to spend 100 S$ for a dinner, in my opinion, should be respected more
4
have been here 5 times now, and the food is consistently good. love the ambience and relaxing feel here, though the service can sometimes be a hit-and-run.
5
One of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. The bread is really good. Good portion. Great selection of wines with reasonable price
5
It has never disappointed us, we come here on a near bi weekly basis!! Authentic Italian, cooked with heart. Run by a passionate lovely Chef. We love this place!
5
authentic good italian food, you feel you are in good hands when you meet the remarkably dynamic lady owner.
5
When you walk in the restaurant, you may think that you are dining in Italy. Very friendly staff and chefs from Italy. Beautiful rustically decor. The dishes are as authentic Italian as you can get especially the small bites of street foods and pastas. Do not go pass the baked pork belly -- just amazing! All the dishes we ordered and the desserts especially the Panna Cotta and Tiramisu are so delicious! Been there on five occasions. Recently, I took my well traveled relatives there and their comment was that it was one of their 3 most memorable dining experiences. Highly recommend and will keep going back
5
This is a very special place for me and my partner. We always celebrate occasion here we never get disappointed here. Most of the dish is superb so its for you to find out. I personally love the Raviolacci with marsala sauce...The service is impeccable! Staff know how to up-sell and very knowledgeable! Will definitely recommend this place!
5
Had my Christmas lunch with my good friend and we really had a great time having our lunch..Good ambience,the food was so great and the waitress and waiters are very accommodating..All the foods that they recommend are fantastic☺️.with a start of truffle bread up to the recommended moscato and red wine
4
Italian Osteria was a pleasant discovery, somewhat out of the way at the new Hill V 2. Kids really enjoyed the pizza, which is made with a lovely crust. Lasagna was good too. But for dessert the apple cake was the highlight of our meal. I highly recommend it. Mid-priced,you will pay a little more for your meal but it's not outrageous. Overall, a very good experience.
4
We've been to many Italian food in SGP but this place has quite a few dishes that is truly unique. For starters, go with the Baked Port Belly, for Baked bread, try the Roman Schiacciata. For pasta, we had the homemade tagliolini with prawns. All interesting and delicious to say the least
3
I've been here three times now and have held off reviewing in the hope things would come together on my next visit. No such luck. This is a popular place, with a unique menu, and it's busy even on week nights. We got a very cramped table by the window. Main courses were decent: the farmer's chicken was tender and well cooked, with great roasted vegetables. The chicken itself, though, wasn't very tasty. We also had a special potato lasagne, billed as a vegetarian main. This was good. Yet things went downhill a bit from there. The still house white is a cheap wine from Sicily which is kept on tap: when our server produced it, it had a head like beer which only settled after a minute. After this, it still tasted off. Serving staff did offer us an alternative--a house Chardonnay that was also marginal, but we kept quiet so as not too make a fuss. We wanted to finish off with panna cotta, but it wasn't available, despite it still being fairly early in the evening. When we paid up the bill was more than expected, and we discovered that the vegetarian special was priced at $32, $10 more than the chicken. We weren't in sight of a specials board, and the server didn't tell us prices -- most people would assume that the vegetarian dish would be the same price if not cheaper than most entrees. So we left with stomachs reasonably satisfied, but with a feeling of dissatisfaction. I know friends love this place, and it has its good points, but it isn't a standout for me
4
There are many restaurants in this city state, but this the one we most often return to. The sharing concept and the different menu, belly pork being the best! We usually bring our own wine making it all the more economic. Best to book ahead.
4
Authentic Italian food, served by foreign waiters. Interesting menu that is constantly renewed. Been here twice and both time there were new items in the menu. Food is good, will come back though it's quite pricy.
4
Food is really awesome and affordable. The italian waiter was very knowledgeable about the food and was very detailed about the Specials of the evening. However, the desserts were a little pricey (eg: $14 for a slice of cake) but it was delicious!
4
Really loved the pork belly and Braised beef with mashed potatoes! However quite disappointed with their classic pasta Vongole. Quite bland and the ravioli was cooked well. Dessert were awesome! Try the sorbet! Will come back again for their meat dishes and dessert!
4
My Favourite go to restaurant in Bukit Timah! Service is always spot on as is the food! Be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointment as this restaurant is always busy!
4
My fiance brought me here for Valentine's Day. Good thing he managed to reserved a seat for two, few days before Feb 14 because this place is jam-packed!!! All the seats were taken and there was a long line of couples/group of friends waiting outside the restaurant. The place is definitely instagrammable. The vibe that time though wasn't, it was just too busy and crowded. We might try some other time, probably during brunch, to get a more relax ambiance.The serving is enough for sharing and everything is worth every penny. Their food is really good, in fact, we haven't finished our dessert, we already decided we want to go back as soon as possible. We forgot to order their famous Porchetta (crispy pork belly).On top of that, for a jam packed place like that, their service was pretty impressive. We can't remember waiting for more than 30 mins for our food. They were pretty attentive as well.Definitely a place worth visiting more than once. Must try everything on their menu! Good place for couples and gathering with friends
5
I have to admit - i love Italian food, but my tastebuds are spoiled. My friend Stefano invited us to IO which is for a Saturday lunch normally a bit far away from our place, but I am just happy he did. First impression busy, loud and looks just what I expect from an Osteria. Tons of food display, open kitchen and busy cooks n waiters. I let Stefano order and he said lean back and enjoy and warned me days before to come with an empty stomach. What happened then the next 2-3 hours was not only amazing but close to perfection. We basically eat 'only' appetizers, but thinking of it makes me now, even after one week, still smiling in a way of complete happiness. We had some must try like 'burrata special', a whole huge burrata mozzarella with parma ham n rucola. Best i tried in my entire life. Secondly a must try is 'Schtacciata truffle' a kind of layerbread with cheese n truffle melted in the layers.. wow. We added 'porchetta', a fennel filled pork knuckle piece and a large platter of assorted pizza. The pizza is Roma style, in square shape, with different toppings like marinara, mushroom or pepperoni. Forget about any other pizza in Singapore if you love real Italian pizza, the crust/dough is perfect. Luckily we left space for THIS dessert as i couldn't believe it could get even better... 'Millefoglie' a layer cake full of rich chocolate and nuts... speechless ! The pistachio tiramisu was not only great as well but the Millefoglie alone is a guarantee to return to IO too.... if u skip the bottle of wine then the damage on the pocket can be limited, but it is more than worth. See u soonest again - love that resto, should buy shares.... !
5
Thank goodness we found this place, because at least 2 of our preferred Italian restaurants in Singapore have been taken over or have closed! iO is our new goto for consistency good Italian fare. The place is more often than not very busy with a great, lively atmosphere. Staff are experienced and attentive yet not overly gushy. We have been several times now and have had a variety of things from the menu. None have disappointed. I especially love the pork belly, accompanied with some salad or a side dish and washed down with a Peroni. Breads are great too. Yummy
5
It was a gathering cum meeting amongst 4 couples about a business proposition and this restaurant was chosen.Luckily, a reservation was made otherwise one had to wait in line. The place was packed!!! Just means that they are doing the right thing!!! Ran by mainly Italians that it feels you are in a cantina!Food were fantastic, shared the Merlanzano Parmigiana, Quattro Formaggio Pizza and Tagliatelle with Prawns between my Wife and I and the other couples shared different food between themselves. Our server, Jody was outstanding! Will recommend to others! Keep it up, Buona Fortuna! Grazie
5
My family comes back over and over again for birthdays and special occasions and each time we love it more. Frederico, Jody and the service team are such warm hosts they have become like family. Anna is an incredible head chef and she makes the whole place her own to share the best experience for her guests
4
Delicious food, a tad salty. Very good service. One of us just wanted a simple pasta in pomodoro sauce which was not on the menu, they did it and it was delicious.
On the downside, although we had wine and other drinks, water was charged.
5
A friend took us here for dinner when we were on holiday. A small unpretentious restaurant serving delicious Italian food. Worth a visit and will definitely come here again on future trips to Singapore.
5
If ever after good Italian food, ambience and great service, visit them. Reservations recommended and suggest checking out their specials, worth every penny.
5
Let me just start by saying this restaurant we didn't have a great start with them. Meaning we had a misunderstanding with the service staff when we first ate there. But the lady owner, she more than made up for it and we could feel that it was a very sincere. So we came back.And it's hard not to. The food there is outstanding. Everything is amazing. I have brought colleagues, parents, kids and everyone loves the food.Next, the little stuff. One of their superb staff ask my four year-old if he would like to come to the pantry area and he said yes and they went on a mini-walk/tour. He came back with a bag of cookie treats compliments of them. Now, I'm not writing this review because of the little bag of treats. But the sincerity and time taken to make the whole dining experience from a pleasant passable one to a superb unforgettable one.So the warmth, care and love is totally felt and appreciated. And feels exactly like this Italian family extending their home to us. We will be back again and again and again
4
Visited there once. Recommended by a friend for good italian food.I had salad, beef (from mains), followed by cake. The food taste & presentation is beyond my expectation, service super friendly, I'm really happy to recommend this to my friends & family.But I find lighting is way to bright. For a dinner it looks like sit at the food court. The light should be warm & dim, IMHO
4
Was suggested this place which is very far away from my place. Once I tried it, it's hard not to come back. Love their bread, pizza, pasta and dessert (especially the tiramisu). And yes, must must try their roasted pork in order not to regret. Make a reservation before you head down oh as it gets pack easily
4
This place is almost fully packed on a Saturday night about 9pm, cherrily noisy & vibrant!Be sure to order the Assorted Pizza (comes in Small, Medium and Large sizes) which comprises pizza slices in 5 varieties with different cheeses, salami slices, ham, mushrooms, minced pork, tomato paste and bacon. Unlike the pizza from Naples which is round with a thin crust, the pizzas here originate from Rome; thicker crust with yummy crispy edges! We also ordered the mixed salad...good choiceand for drinks, go for the Spritz Aperol
5
Everything here was perfect, that atmosphere is great, for the food we ordered the bacon roll, meatballs, rice suppli, eggplant parmigiana, pork belly, calamari, orecchiette, and ravioli. All of that was brilliant (my favourite was the orecchiette) Along with the food and atmosphere the service was great, attentive without being intrusive.5 out of 5
5
Today my Son and I dinner at Io Osteria, far away from my house the only thing I want to tell is by far my favorite restaurant in Singapore not care about the distance , today I was lucky Anna Barras chef and owner cooks for us, and just I said the magic word we are in your hands, and what a surprise dinner we have, food, attentions, service Ambience wow. Sorry Gordon Ramsey bread street you are my second best , Anna is not a Michelin rewards, but for sure is a STAR and still number one for me.My advice just pass by and you have your reward
4
Been an Italian background, I am always on the watch for good Italian restaurants. This restaurant is a new concept, I believe it’s the same owners who also own the popular Etna restaurants at Duxton and East Coast. The restaurant offers authentic Italian food from across Italy. The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend’s home. I was impressed with the open-concept kitchen, and the own still and sparkling water made on premise, and other feature was the white and red wines are freshly pulled from a barrel tap. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. The dishes that we tried, was The pasta Handmade Raviolacci with meat filling 4 round ravioli filled with slow cooked in oven beef with a cream sauce, and Cavatelli Burnt Wheat Pasta with Eggplant & Tomato Has diced eggplant, fresh and sun dried tomato, The Pecorino cheese also added flavour to the dish, this was something unique, Porchetta Baked pork belly with wild fennel and black pepper, Nice good crackling on the outside. The fennel added a good flavour, and for Desserts Tiramisu in a jar Served in a glass jar, the tiramisu has little alcohol in it and topped with pistachio crumbs, and finally Lemon Tart a slice of the lemon tart topped with Italian Meringue. The meringue is soft and not hard with lemon peel and have vanilla seeds folded in. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Italian cuisine

We ordered seafood platter and us rib eye steak. The portion is huge. The service was average ok. The overall price was not cheap but ok considered the huge portion.

It is a good place to taste Italian food. The staff there are very friendly and happy to introduce all the good food.

Brilliant setting. Authentic Italian cuisine.Recycled-paper menu on the table gives you exciting selections, blackboardxserves you special deal. Listen to the italian accented waiting staff explaining the dishes. These are truly wonderful experience.I have not about food yet. Simply delicious. I like to order a few entres, no need mains. Good enough. The risotto is great if u need rice to fill the tummy.You will like the atmosphere there, and the food

I was there with a friend, and restaurant was full, we had some different starters, the small pizza with garlic and no sauce was nice and crunchy, the olive ascolana was a bit to dry to my taste, we had a day special gnocco with mortadella and tomino cheese which i found a bit tasteless, and propably was made hours before as gnocco was very hard, and then we had 2 different pastas, the special of the day pizzoccheri, which was ok, not special, and then pasta with squid sauce, which my partner did not like at all. As dessert we had pistacchio tiramisu' which was fantastic, really really nice.Very gentle owner, she visited the table to check if all was ok and nice personnel.I want to re-visit and try something else for a better judgement
4
We came on a Saturday night. Place was crowded and bustling. We were seated quickly and served pretty fast, despite a busy Saturday. I liked garganelli lamb. That's a pasta. My wife ordered an aglio aglio, but she didn't liked it much. The garlic bread was just two big slices and $6 for it was a bit overpriced. Most of the chefs and staff looked like they are Italians.
5
Rustic decor & authentic Sicilian cuisine with fresh produces keeps us going back for more fresh bake breads, burrata, pizza, eggplant permigiana as well as rib eye steak. Sicilian Cannoli with ricotta filling is a must try desert. Can also shop genuine Italian products from pastas to wine ! Gives you a warm family restaurant feeling of good service by Italian family of Chef Ms. Anna Borasi. Good food @ Good Value for food lovers 
5
I was there just a couple of days ago, still cannot forget about my braised beef flavour in the mouth! Highly recommended by the good service staff, me and my Friend just decided to go with the flow, and took all the recommended dishes ... Pork belly, orecciete pork sausage and truffle bread! Just amazing!! Will definitely come back ! Thumbs up!!!!
3
We ordered bruschetta sauted mushroom, bacon roll, burrata parma ham, mixed grilled fish and seafood platter and us ribeye steak which were all average. The US ribeye steakwas too big a portion which cost $42. The service was OK but the foreign wait staff had a kind of attitude problem. The overall price was not chea
5
This place serves very yummy Italian food. We been here as a family for the 4th time.We realized that at our 4th visit, this is still the only dining place we have tried!Food is solid! Yummy and always reminding us to come back for more. There is a lot of desserts that I would like to try!Service is good. The waiters are able to make good recommendations and are always smiley.The place is always packed and reservations is always recommended. I believe there are 2 seating on weekends, 6p and 8p.Nice place and great food. We will return for more
3
It is almost always very packed. Their good reputation must have really travelled wide to enjoy such a thriving business. Mind you the food menu is not that cheap, I'd say the items are close to that of a 5-star dining, but the ambience is relatively more casual. Afterall, you come here only if you are a real foodie, who wants the authentic taste of Italian pasta, pizza, salads, mains that include Ribeye steak costing S$72, and Lamb shank at $36, desserts range around S$16 a piece
2
Restaurant is simply furnish which is comfortable but I must say food is disappointing. I order spaghetti carbonara which is too salty and the pizza is really not my type. It comes in rectangular shapes and thick crust but it's hard. Will never come again.
4
Always a great place to dine be it with family or just a special date with wife. The chef specials are different with each of our visit and the portions are great. Service was excellent too!
5
We were 6 and only had a selection of 7 starters, everyone of them delicious. Service was excellent and the bill not too threatening!
4
Loved this restaurant...from their italian street food to the gellato....everything was nice.
Their swordfish special starter & Black Olive Risotto was something very new & authentic for me...and their Grandma's special Lasagna was hot and nicely baked.
Definitely coming back here
5
This is by far the best Italia restaurant in Singapore. The pasta specials are really tasty! The bread is made by them and it's super tasty. The schiacciata is also another one of my favourite. Today we had monkfish pasta! Super Yummy and the prices are reasonable! Well done guys! I

Friends brought us there for lunch, most food we order was good.Staff very helpful, very friendly.We had traditional roman schiacciata $18, porchetta, baked pork belly, wild fennel $16Pasta with cod fish ( not on the menu) assorted pizza $24 (4type of pizza serve together) burrats, parma ham $19Pistachio tiramisu in a jar $10 ,sorbetto, refreshing lemon,peach $10For 4pax we spent about $150. Good Italian restaurant but a bit out of the way for me
1
The food was ok NOT Amazing and nothing special , but the services was terrible , the guy (around 27/28 years old) I think is the owner or manager with short black hair was super arrogant, rude . We felt uncomfortable . WE HAD BAD

Lively, large restaurant, noisy and crowded on a Saturday night, with staff racing around. Amusing decor with pictures of old Italy on the walls and old culinary items. Modernised but rustic feel with wooden tables and chairs. At the entrance a wall of bottles, wines and offers of the week and intriguing deli items to take away. On a Saturday night they had two sittings. Book two days in advance to be sure of a table at weekend nights although they accept some walk-ins. Remember to check the board which has daily specials at higher prices.Food from Sicily rather than the usual conventional Italian menu. Large menu with pasta and meat dishes in unusual sauces. My glass of Prosecco was so-so but the drinks menu features many more unusual items which attract the eyes of wine buffs. The menu also offers a glass of sparkling white.Filling, rich food for gourmets and gluttons. (A complete contrast to the salad bar and fruit juices I had at the Tanglin Club.)Several pasta dishes. Nothing like food in conventional Italian restaurants in England. We looked up dish names on Google on our mobile phones.Not much in the way of vegetables or fresh fruit in the meals we chose. Whilst waiting for the main course I headed straight for the two cabinet of desserts featuring chocolate and cream and contrasting colours. The phrase 'spoilt for choice' comes to mind. Dessert lovers' heaven.Desserts include some tarts with fruit based centres, smaller and lower price than the other options. The tiramisu had lots of cream, too much, whilst a delightful dessert with more of a nut base was solid, but we split two desserts so we got a balance of flavours and textures. Friendly, jolly lady runs the place if you want a quick chat or a special request. (We'd previously ordered a cake for a birthday party.)We'll definitely go back, preferably at lunch or a weekday evening when you can linger and don't feel rushed and we'll also try out the other two restaurants in the group

We live near HillV2 where this restaurant is located. We have eaten here many times and will continue to go back. They have changing specials as well as a great menu. I really like their salt baked fish when they have it. Their steaks are great. We love their pizza's. The restaurant is run by an Italian family and is very cozy, but busy on most nights. Recommend a reservation. They have some decent wine, but if you are particular, I would bring your own or buy from the wine shop next door
4
It is not often that you could find an affordable and comfortable place to enjoy authentic cooking in Singapore, dinning out is getting more expensive by the days. In this place, you could have a satisfying meal with beer under $40 per head inclusive of service and GST. It is casual and relax, you could have an Italian communal style of sharing multi-course pizza, antipasti, pastas, meat, fish and dessert. I highly recommend that you try the rice ball with melting mozzarella in the core and the baked pork belly with wild fennel and pepper in the center. The beer, cocktails and wine selection are also comprehensive. And of course to finish them off with a strong cup of espresso
5
Love this gem at hillview2
The chefs are mostly Italian, long queue during weekends. Nice pizza and pastas , lovely the service too as the chef and crew constantly checked if we are okay.
5
The ambience is great, service is great and food is very delicious too! They have daily specials too. Would like to try their desserts/pie/tart, the next time I'm back there. and if you're heading down on a weekends, do make reservations :)
5
OMG!!This place is to die for ,the food my goodness is superb.We tried so many items on the menu and after one to the other is just wonderful. Even the desserts and wine. My mouth was dancing with every bite. This is the place if you love Italian this is home.Service was excellent too and the Host she was amazing. I am missing you already
5
Our first time at iO, booking over the phone with no issues. Sunday around 2pm, the restaurant is quite packed.However service is pretty fast.Quality wise, food is superb.We open with a traditional bruschetta, very tasty and then the mains:: "Paccheri with polpo ragout" was delicious and "Tagliolini with tartufo" (truffle) is not just truffle flavoured. Plenty of the actual precious mushroom.Final espresso is good.Price is reasonable. Will be back again soon

This place serves pasta, pizza and casual Italian 'street food' (tapas-style portions). We went for dinner around 7pm and the place was packed. Lots of kids. Service was quite speedy until the end of our dinner when we asked for the check - the servers seemed overwhelmed by the number of customers. The two of us had a small cold cut board, octopus pasta (special of the day), orecchiette with pork sausage, rice ball with cheese, pistachio tiramisu, cannoli and a quarter flask of wine (which amounted to two glasses). Just a note, the server who told us about the specials did not take the initiative to tell us the prices of the specials, so be sure to ask first. The table next to us ordered the roast sea bass which looked good. The orecchiette looked small, but was a decent sized portion (the cream sauce was very filling).The bill was about ~SGD140, which was quite expensive (the octopus pasta was the most expensive item). Maybe next time we go, we'll order a few of the street food items to just share
5
Tucked well away from all the attractions of Singapore is the real GEM. As my Italian Friend said it is like my mums food. Simple yet oh so tasty. For me the real standouts were the Bruschetta and the deserts WOW WOW WOW. Bursting with flavour and little surprises in each mouthful. If you need an Italian hit, then this is great.
5
Had a very enjoyable lunch with friends yesterday! The server was very helpful in his suggestions. We had an assortment of starters, pasta and mains. All very tasty! The porchetta was very nicely done, skin was so crunchy. The restaurant has a very nice casual feel and is good for big groups. Highly recommended

My family and some friends went for lunch around 2-2:30pm on a Sunday. Service initially seemed a little slower than usual. In any case we ordered several starters and main courses. Starters turned up without issue. These were soon cleared away and a few minutes later 2 of the 7 main courses arrived....then nothing. Not even an offer of parmesan cheese for one of the pasta courses that had arrived. After around 10 minutes I turned around to see what looked like most, if not all the restaurant staff (incl kitchen staff) eating their lunches. Waited a few more minutes and then stood up and had to go search for our waitress. When I asked where the rest of our food was and when we were likely to get some service the responses were bordering on hostile - basically 'we are eating and you need to wait.' 15 minutes later 3 more main courses turned up and then finally several minutes after that my own meal - pizza - arrived. When I challenged the service I received an explanation around how the staff needed to eat their meals and that the meals we had ordered took longer to prepare. Basically rather than an apology for, what was by any standard, the spectacularly poor service I just got well....'attitude'. I refused to pay for the pizza and asked for the service charge to be removed as well. Again more attitude! 'I will give you a number of a supervisor to call' was the response. In any case I am not going back as I cannot tolerate that level of poor service and the attitude from the staff than accompanied it. Shame really...

Wonderful wholesome Italian food served in a warm family like environment. The food is simply excellent and well worth the drive up to Hillview - excellent value and their Deli is full of great stuff that you can pick up to stock your fridge/pantry. #1 Everyday Italian in Singapor
5
So far, I've been here twice. I can truly say that every single dish ends up being my favourite. Start off with bacon roll. This crunchy bacon exterior is made with perfection when it is filled with this gooey cheese that pops in your mouth making it all sticky and warm inside. Definitely a foodgasm. Then, order the risotto bolognese dotted with cheese and baked to perfection till the cheese melts with every single scoop. Trust me the carbs are worth It! To be honest, so far, everything on the menu is good and it's of a reasonable price. Would definitely come back again
5
Have been there twice, every dish is delicious and beautifully presented. Service is very efficient, dignified and friendly.
Only suggestion, perhaps this restaurant should expand its space, all the tables will certainly be filled up with the overwhelming popularity.
5
Advisable to book , first class Italian food , great atmosphere and friendly staff , value for money which is usually not something you would see in Singapore for a restaurant of this calibre , we sat at the chefs high chair table last week looking into the kitchen , had a fabulous experience and was incredibly well looked after by a very busy head Chef , will be a regular visitor
4
We had a dinner celebration for spouse's birthday together with 2 other family members. We ordered several items to share, which included cheese platter, parma ham, pizzas, pasta, soup, and some meats. It was a good dinner and they make good pasta.When it came to dessert cakes, you are spoiled for choice. But having tried it, for my personal taste, the food options fare far better than the desserts. For this restaurant, it does somewhat cost quite a bit. Eg. As a gauge, a cake can fetch like $12++. So bring along only worthy friends and family :)With regards to the location, the place has a nice ambience and is almost always crowded. The lady boss (Italian) had actually brought her crew from home to run this restaurant. So you can be very sure the food and taste is authentic

We visited on a Friday night as two families with kids. It was very busy and we waited for a little while for our reserved table. We were not worried about that as there was space to wait in the AC and let some of the kids run around outside on the esplanade. (I mention it in case you visit on a busy night.) Trust me - its worth the short wait. The fresh baked bread and pizza right near the front door will get your mouth watering. One of the baking/pizza staff noticed us waiting with kids - he cut some fresh bread off a loaf straight from the oven for them to snack on. To me, little things like that make the difference. We had a nice big table - room for kids one end and adults the other. Staff were brilliant. Our waiter - from Italy - clearly knew his stuff. Very friendly and very efficient. He adjusted order for one of the kids without fuss and had their meals out quick-smart. Whilst everything was delicious - the porchetta is spectacular. The pizza and lasagne were great, so was the risotto. Nice range of drinks. It was nice to have some Italian beers that weren't over the top in price. We didn't have dessert (too full) so cant provide comment on that. Very happy we visited. Seems like a great spot for friends and family. If you are looking for quiet couples dining, it may be best to go on a week night (not Friday). I highly recommend Io Italian Osteria.

All our food was delicious. The grilled pork chop was very well done; tender and moist down to the very last cut. Our prawn tagliolini was also delicious. Tiramisu, coffee all very good. The house wine, though, was disappointing, which I hope they will improve on in the future. We had a second glass changed to a Sangiovese and we were enjoying good wine then. The waiters were very polite, helpful and patient when we enquired on the menu. Relaxed, casual mood. We will be back for more
4
Went for a casual family dinner. The restaurant was modern but warm and a good place to go out with friends or family. That was complimented by some good food. We ordered Assorted Pizzas, Baked eggplant parmigiana, Lasagna and the Orecchiette. Everything was just spot on & we all enjoyed the food. Maybe not the best Italian in Singapore, but still good enough for me to go back again. Finally, if you are there, do pick up some bread - they are awesome 
5
Great and fast service, food was on the table within 10minutes from order. Huge portions. We had the pork sausage rolls for an appetizer. Only comment here is it was a small portion for $10. But the Main courses were bit. We ordered the mutton paste penna (cant remember the actual name..heheh) and the farm roasted chicken.. And chocolate lava cake with the espresso ice cream.. It was a perfect dinner.. Would love to head back for more and maybe try their cakes.. They also sell cookies and pizzas at the front of the shop like a little bakery
5
Despite the location (i live along the east coast), I've come to eat at iO for the 4th time today. Brought my family to eat, and they loved it. My parents commented on the genuine service from the staff because they noticed the staff making regular checks on all the tables. A MUST to order their stuffed truffle and cheese crispy bread and their house pour red wine was lovely as well.
5
Another awesome evening we had yesterday (13th June 2016).Been to this place twice with ny bf and we were both so in love witht this place .Me and my GF had not met for almost 2 years and I was glad when she also initiate for us to have dinner at IO even after giving so many option to her.Love the steaks here (reason why I am here) juicy/tender and the doneness is topnotch.Will definately be back again.With different peers.Thank you IO for having us.Its a pleasure. X
5
iO is a happy place - it's a hive of activity in the open plan kitchen, and with high ceiling and lots of sunlight streaming in - perfect place for a family meal or a casual get together with friends. Staff are friendly and efficient too.We love the grilled pork starter (filled with fennel) - tasty and crisp altho just s tad dry. The cannelloni was very delicious and so was the roasted spicy chicken - tender and juicy, cooked to perfection. It helps too that house wines are good but inexpensive (eg $48 a bottle). We'll be back for sure
4
sat by the bar table, beside the kitchen, seeing the chefs cook was a joy, smelling the garlic, olive oil, seeing the pasta being tossed was as close as you will see in a cooking show.
4
genuine italian restaurant"osteria"! nicely laid-out setting felt like real italian!food very good and genuine!excellent ingridients and typical mediterranean! veru good service,efficient and friendly staff!fanastic variety of "antipasta" dishes! business+family
friendly!will come back anytime!
5
The atmosphere is very homely, with famed italian hospitality.The staff are mostly italians with very pleasant service.Food is definitely very close to the ones I tried in Italy itself. Price is also very value for money! Easy access from Downtown Line - Hillview station, and a short walk to HillV2
5
The first time I visited, the pizza took me back to the pizza made by Italian Nonna neighbour in the 70's. It was that good. The ingredients are primarily sourced from overseas and the food is generally amazing. Many of the staff are Italian which also provides an air of authenticity. I can't recommend it highly enough, it's great for a casual bite or for something special.
5
The food was served in a timely manner and was all bursting with flavor! Each dish had its own star quality that included a home-cooked rustic feel. Wine was robust and complementary to the food, service was attentive and welcoming as well! Such a gem in the area and always looking forward to visit

My first visit for Mother's Day lunch on Sunday with my extended family of 15. Terrible service, mostly what looked like Italian waiters, gave me the impression they wished they weren't there to work that day. It was a busy lunch and they were likely overworked but that's no excuse for their unsmiling faces, putting dishes down wherever they found space and expecting the diners to pass the dish to the correct person and turning away when trying to get their attention.I ordered two starters and was kept waiting while everyone else's food came and was being eaten. I politely reminded the waiters a few times. It was only when I jokingly said I'll be eating alone that the waiters went to check and found out they had forgotten my order altogether! By the way, the calamari was simply terrible. The meatballs were good though. From the other reviews, the food must be decent. But go there expecting less than ideal service.What got my chains was the following episode...My brother and I wanted to order a soft drink for $4 but the owner suggested an 'italian' one, a better one making fun of my simpleton taste in soft drinks. When the bill came, I realised I had been given the $12, most expensive, soft drink. And we had ordered 4 of them! So we paid $48 for soft drinks. I felt cheated. I was happy with the $4 soft drink. I didn't need a fancy organic Italian lemonade for $12. When my mother told the owner of this ugly incident, she simply said she didn't know the prices of the drinks in her restaurant. Sounds like a con job to me! If the owner was sincere in her mistake, she could easily refund the balance and the matter would be closed. But she didn't. As I tell my children, people can only cheat me once.Anyway, there are plenty of good, well-run, service-orientated Italian restaurants in Singapore. My life will go on fine if I don't visit IO again

iO Italian Osteria is about flavour - good, authentic, mouth-seducing Italian flavour - and texture. No refining the flavour till it's lost it's roots; no compromising the essential texture. You get used to flavour and texture in Singapore but it's mostly in one of the thousands of Asian food outlets. So in Singapore food culture, iO feels like it really belongs.We were four, who've each devoted much time to the enjoyment and discussion of food, two of us had been before, and we'll all be back at the first opportunity. We started with Bruschetta with Sicilian tomatoes & Basil, Stuffed Fried Olives, Tender Meatballs in Hearty Tomato Sauce, and Burrata with Parma Ham, Ruccoloa & Cherry Tomatoes. For a main I had Orrechiette, Pork Sausage & Saffron Sauce and it was profoundly satisfactory. The others remarked similarly about their choices. Dark Chocolate Lava Cake with Espresso Ice Cream was a fitting finale to a great meal.Service excellent and setting lovely (but I'd be happy in almost any setting with this food)
4
We arrived 10 minutes early and had to wait just a little till our appointed booking time. The restaurant was already bustling in the drowning sounds of birthday songs (sung in Italian), servers casually whizzed from table to table and the aroma of Italian food wafted out of the open-concept kitchen. We were seated and the special menu for the night was read to us in the midst of lovely banters between one who was serving us water, while the other was trying to meticulously go through the chef's menu of the day. We chuckled so hard at their convivial exchanges and that set the tone for the night - casual and the "why-so-serious" vibe. Food was of generous portion - do try the Porchetta - the skin was fried to perfect crunchiness and the meat was juicy. The Angus Beef Carpaccio melted with tender softness and the Lamb Ragout pasta gave me a good kick - and I mean a good Italian kick! We did not try the Roman Schiacciata - as our tummies were near explosion and would reserve that for our next visit. The Beer Braised Beef and the Pizza were the tummy pleasers. To further heighten the experience - we ended with jars of Pistachios Tiramisu served in jars. Definitely will be back to eat every thing I did not manage to eat that night. Just remember - relax when you are here, eat the great food and just be merry. Why so serious
5
This is one of a kind restaurant. Homy, friendly, truly Italian with special dishes that you can find only here such as: olive ascolane (fried olives stuffed with pork), suppli (fried rice balls) porchetta (grilled pork). Amazing taste. A must in Singapore.Hint: if you want something unique order the Mazzara del vallo Red Giant Prawn but be careful... They are not cheap
5
The most exciting and tasty Italian food I have had in Singapore. I am not Italian but I have been to Italy loads of times and I can tell you this place hits the spot. It has a smart but fairly casual atmosphere, yet the food quality is better than I've had at several more formal Italian restaurants in the centre of town. Portions were generous, especially the amazing porchetta which can be shared by around 4 people. The house wine, served in various carafe sizes is cheap and very basic, but not unpleasant. They had a great selection of traditional Italian desserts and torta
5
Tasty Italian food in a comfortable and cheerful setting. Prompt service and reasonable rates. Everything we tried was delightful, pork belly was unanimous favourite but the breads, pasta and desserts were all pretty good too.
5
It was my birthday dinner, my husband decided to take me and my son there. What a lovely ambience and excellent taste of food with many choices of menu.
Definitely will come back very soon!
1
The food is orrible , bad quality food , to much salt inside the pasta and pork and the place don't comfortable
2
This is our third and final visit. Foodwise: tended to be on the greasy side. Medium rare ribeye was more akin to medium well. Seafood platter pretty decent though. Servicewise: loads of action in the kitchen but rather understaffed at the tables in the warm restaurant (air conditioning rather weak). Service staff busy and unsmiling. Seems that only one person can take the food orders and that super surly person also mans the till. Dismayingly, she carried herself as if she's doing you a favour. She grumbled we had no reservations when seating us, took ages to take our orders and ignored our "Thank you's" when we paid. Some diners were obviously feted over the rest. Is it an Italian thing or just her? Unpleasant. No need to suffer such attitude, plenty of better similar food elsewhere.
5
Good authentic Italian food – excellent attentive service – they just quietly keep their eye on you and notice what you need. Charming without being overfamiliar. The food is really delicious and it is definitely worth the trek up here. (Of course it depends where you live!) The portions are generous- my pork belly with fennel appetiser was easily a main course…. I actually had two appetisers and it was definitely sufficient and I am quite greedy! Really look forward to returning and trying more of the menu … another reviewer suggests going in a group so you can try different dishes – good plan! Ooohhh and they have Averna…. the location is quite interesting – and handy to have the new Hillview MRT station (Downtown line) so close by ….Era tutto squisito, i nostri compliment
5
iO is a traditional Italian restaurant with cosy family feel once you step in. With an open-style kitchen, you can see the Italian chefs whipping up the dishes, and fresh pizzas being displayed at the counter. The serving staffs are very professional, and explain the menu and specials very well. Food is generally delicious, do try the baked lasagna and tiramisu, they are fantastic. The specials are delicious as well, but they change frequently. Do reserve seats as they are crowded during weekends
4
This was my first visit to the restaurant with two friends. The deco was industrial like. Display of bread, pizza and desserts for takeaway was at the entrance. We made a reservation for 6.30pm on sat. night. The place was very busy. We ordered Grilled Farmers Salad, Crispy seafood and Assorted Pizza (medium). The Farmers Salad was an excellent choice. It had a good variety of grilled vegetables such as vine-ripen tomatoes, artichoke, eggplants, red and green peppers and more. The medium size assorted Pizza gave us four fairly large rectangular slices with different toppings. The crust of the pizza was very good, different from what you get from the fast food type. The only dish that we did not like was the crispy seafood, too much batter and hard. The portions were large. We could not finish the pizza and had to pack the remainder of the pizza. On the whole, good value for money. The place was busy and a tad noisy if you were seated next to families with children. I will definitely return for a meal on a less crowded weekday evening
4
The italian food was great the bread was fresh... Wasnt a fan of the lamb pasta but my husband liked it portion seemed a bit less had a starter garlic bread pasta and a medium seafood platter paid about S$76. Which is a bit pricey. But it was alright. Was very crowded def need to make reservations...
4
We have visited this eatery 6 times in the past two months with different groups and always found the food and service to be consistently good. Our friends also liked the food and experience and also returned with their families and friends.Our of the dishes we regularly order is schiacciata truffle, a grilled bread filled with truffle oil and mushrooms - really decadent and very delicious.Another is the burrata, which has a huge dollop of the very fresh cheese nestled among arugula leaves, tomatoes and other vegetables. We also like the orecchiette pork, cooked with pasta.On the most recent visit, we added eggplant parmigina. The eggplnt was cooked till soft in a tasty tomato-based sauce. It was not bad, though I would have liked a stronger dash of olive oil in there.Service, as always, was warm and friendly. Immust say that I have not seen the elderly lady who runs the restaurant lately and hope she is okay
5
This place has a good choice of dishes on the menu. Food is very tasty, well presented and looks authentic to me. Portions are good for the price (Ravioli- though good -can not be a main, but in Italian style as part of a meal) Service is friendly and attentive 
5
I'm Italian and whenever I eat at this restaurant I feel like at home. Great food, great ambience and great service. You won't forget it! Not forgetting Anna, the executive Chef who is the real Mamma italiana! :-)
3
The iO Osteria serves unpretentious italian food with a simple menu but also offer daily specials which is worth trying. The ingredients are fresh, tasted good and presented well. The dining atmosphere was definitely pleasant with great service.
4
Best Italian food outside of Italy I ever tried. Short of max rating due to a few items on the menu were sold out. Will be back to try them for sure.
5
Tucked away in a corner of HillV2 is this wonderful Italian restaurant where the chefs and many of the serving staff are, authentically, Italians.The setting is casual and relaxed with brass cutlery, wood furnishings and shelves of condiments & wine bottles serving as backdrop. Service is prompt and the staff are very helpful in recommending dishes.I have not been to Italy and therefore am not in a position to judge if any dish is authentically Italian, but the dishes I tried certainly tasted very different from the chain Italian joints like Pasta Fresca. The food is cooked with fresh ingredients and done perfectly. The Traditional Roman Schiaciatta is a "must-have" but be warned that it serves 3-4. I had the Spicy Roasted Farm Chicken, which was absolutely scrumptious!For dessert, the Pistachio Tiramisu is worth trying.It's a pity I am teetotal but the wines really look tempting and the other patrons seem to really enjoy pairing their food with wine.This restaurant is a gem

If you are not Italian, you may not know what an Osteria is. Oste means innkeeper of a place where wine is served. Over the years they added simple food to the wine. So Osterias are in Italy simple restaurants with good and traditional food, normally short menus, sometimes changing daily, no sofistivations and basic service. Most of the times, they are family run, the mum is cooking and father is serving. Prices are typically affordable.Here we are in Singapore and all is modern and new, but among the many Italians I have tried, this Is the closer to an italian osteria. Good food, simple, friendly and decent prices

Located at one end of HillV2, nearest Dean and Delucca, this is a restaurant with very relaxed vibes and good food. We started with Schiacciata truffle, which was a lovely crusted bread stuffed with truffled topping, and which was truly delicious. We also ordered a burata special - while expensive at $38 before taxes, it had a nice big chunk of burata cheese, though it could have done with a bit more ham.We had two pasta dishes, the Orecchiette pork and the special tuna pasta for the day. The pork dish was done in saffron sauce and was well liked, while the tuna, which had pine nuts in it, was okay, though was also on the pricey side at $32.The braised beef was recommended by the server in lieu of the roasted chicken. It was braised in beer and came with a side of mashed potato, was tender, but was also a little dry.Desserts were too sweet for me, though some of the party liked them. We had the panna cotta with caramel (the best dessert), a Zuppa Inglese and a dessert of the day, which was something like a meringue. Staff are mostly of Italian descent and service is pretty good. Parking can be limited, so you might need to wait for a spot
5
I had the baked farm chicken. It was soft and delicious. The food was in rather large portions and I could not eat the desserts as a result. This place is worth another visit even if you live away. The only negative thing was they had no interesting drinks on the menu. No mocktails or cocktails. But that's the only downside. The service was quick, efficient and they even help to pack the food that you cannot finish

Saya berkunjung ke restoran ini pada awal tahun 2015. Lokasinya sangat dekat dengan kediaman Oom dan Tante saya di Singapore. Kami makan malam disini for my farewell before I go back to Jakarta. The ambiance is really cozy, there are many families there too. And the taste of the food is brilliant. I ate their special dish at the day which is a wholewheat pasta with mozzarela, and the chef itself said that it was a real italian dish. And the one that i cannot forget is the dessert, I ate some kind of pie with riccota cheese and chocolate chips fillings, it was fantastic! I really really love it
5
This place has a limited menu, and I've tried almost every dish there, but it's still worth going often because they have great specials all the time! Traditional authentic pastas and the must try the truffle pizza/focaccia with mascarpone! Heavenly! If you like the kitchen action, you can even sit at the kitchen counter to watch the chefs in action. Don't go empty handed and bring home some freshly baked bread and Italian sauces and ingredients to bring a bit of Italy home! :) Anna the owner is a joy to speak too as well...

We were a table of 9 and seated at the large wooden family table. The restaurant has a laid back neighbourhood feel with lots of natural light. Being a large party meant we could try quite a few of their dishes - the standouts were the salt baked Italian sea bass, truffle bread and orecchiette with bacon and saffron sauce. Etna, the Chef chatted with us while she deboned the se bass - that was nice touch and enhanced the family style restaurant vibe the place was going for. The fritto mists and salads were good too.The restaurant makes their own pannatone for Christmas which we had as dessert together with the limoncello baba (lovely) and pastachio cake (the table favourite). Finished the meal with some good strong coffee. We aren't in the Hillview area very often but imagine this would be the go to neighbourhood place for many who live here
5
I already came back here several times. Truly the best Italian in Singapore at very reasonable price! We can see inside of the active open kitchen to enjoy watching the great cooking skills. Speed and quality of service are also excellent.
4
We arrived for dinner and place was packed - always a good sign! Had a good local Italian beer whilst waiting.Menu and specials board give good selection. I went for Porchetta for starter, which was unbelievably good (and large! Could have for main course for sure!) Around the table we had pasta (menu and special) and fish (a really good looking sesame coated tuna). The food was very good and the waiting staff also friendly and efficient. The whole place just had a really good vibe, with larger groups, couples, some children etcLooks like they do brunches, fresh breads and you can buy sauces etc. Will be back as really good food
5
It was 5 of us on our first visit to this restaurant. We were greeted by the very friendly staff, who gave us some great recommendations on food and wine. The atmosphere is very welcoming and spacious. The food is simply brilliant! We were taken by surprise when the bill was about half of what we expected! iO Italian Osteria is now in our list places for regular dining. Great food, great people, great atmosphere
5
Finding the place is not a given, especially if you are used to go out in the classical places, but IO is really worth the trip: the food is authentic (marvellous burrata, great pizza, lovely pasta plates), the ambiance is warm and cozy, the staff is Italian (friendly, smiley). Kids loved it
5
This place is wonderfully authentic. Brilliant (Italian) staff and fantastic food in a superb environment. The bread alone has to be eaten to be believed. And that's just the start. It gets even better as you go. And wait until you get to the latte. Fantastic experience.
5
Located at hillv2 (Hillview area), this spacious Italian restaurant is casual yet smart looking. The service staff members are very friendly and attentive, making the customers feel relaxed and comfortable. They will recommend the daily specials which are a little more pricey but are not pushy.The quality of food is very good, and feels like authentic Italian home cooked food. Everything we had was excellent, including the desserts. Expect to pay $30 to $50 per head.Overall highly recommended
5
This is a restaurant that I'll return to if I want excellent Italian food. It's not a place for a quiet dinner; the noise contributed to the lively ambience which added to the enjoyable meal. The only 'negative', if any, is that it's not the most convenient place to get to. But if you love food, you'll find your way there
5
Have been here over 15-20 times with family and on my own. They never disappoint! Traditional Italian rustic food with an always changing specials menu. Everything on the menu delights. We love this place. Plus, the Italian staff and owner are fantastic. Couldn't recommend this restaurant highly enough. We never ever go into the city for Italian food anymore!Top tip - sit at the kitchen bar and be amazed!
5
After the first two antipastos, we were already telling ourselves we are definitely coming back for more and bringing the rest of the family with us to try the delicious food offered by this restaurant. Except for the "rough cut" pasta dish which was a mite salty, all the dishes we tried were fantastic. Wholesome Italian - as it should be - done by real Italian chefs. The porchetta was one of the best we've ever had. When we cut through the crisp crackling, we were engulfed by the amazing aroma of the pork and it's stuffing. We also had one of the specials which was a crepe stuffed with mushroom, spinach and cheese in a tomato cream sauce - OUTSTANDING! We cannot say enough good things about this place. The ambience and service was also excellent. We will be back
5
Had an excellent family lunch. Service very friendly and efficient. Moved us to a larger table though they were very busy. Helpings are very generous and reasonably priced. The aperol set the mood for lunch. Was followed by an excellent lasagna, roast chicken and stew. Service wand value for money was excellent and food was very good - overall excellent
4
The restaurant is in a new small mall, located at one end of Hillview area; in a quiet & nice environment.
Food is great, authentic & reasonably priced. Nice, relaxing ambience. Service attentive & friendly.
Definitely, this won't be our last visit.
4
Good variety menu with daily chief specials, this is our first time here, best pasta ever! We're definitely coming back for more, gonna try their assorted seasonal vegetables in beer batter and the sautéed mushrooms next visit!
5
Been here too many times. The quality of food is excellent. Love the big size burrata, pasta and everything they serve!!
5
I ate at this restaurant almost 3 times per month. Too good to resist. Really reminds me of the food when I was in Italy.
5
Casual dining outlet but fantastic food of high quality. Has a regular menu of winners, and an over changing list of today's specials which is a nice touch for those who frequents. Pricing is reasonable for both food and drinks. Regular haunt and definitely a place for Italian food cravings
5
Simply decorated restaurant, aiming for the Tuscan feel and look. But, service here is great, with a good mix of Italians and local servers. The servers are very knowledgeable about the regular menu and special menu items and give good recommendations. You can choose from the small plates of street food dishes, opt for the Roman style pizzas or the mains, all of which are great. I recommend the Porchetta, which is my family's favourite. The kids love the lasagna and risotto whilst the steaks always turn out great. The devil's roasted spring chicken comes out with crispy skin and moist flavourful meat and its rather a lot for just one person
5
This is our best casual restaurant in our neighborhood. An authentic Italian that we have visited many times. We only order a few small plates when we are not too hungry but want to eat tasty food. They sell fresh home-baked Italian bread, deserts or delicatessen stuff. Friendly staff well organized by Anna who always make us feel welcome.
4
i like this restaurant. the wait staff are friendly and engaging.the food is decently priced, and they even served a decent sized piece of grilled beef for a modest price by singapore standards.dined here 3x now ... good each time, although on each of the 3x i've only ordered the $39 steak.i like the desserts too. very nice. totally sinful, but very nice.the only thing i don't quite like are its pizzas, but its more about their interpretation of pizza than it is about taste. i prefer thin crusted pizzas, they serve their pizzas think. but that's splitting hairs.overall, very nice
4
So this neighborhood might not be so well-known for hip Italian restaurant but this place certainly it. They have nice open windows so the restaurant has long windows so one can request for the window seats look over flats but also nice greenery. The minute you enter the restaurant there is this wonderful aroma of freshly backed pizza and bread and you instantly feel hungry. The service staff are very friendly - all Italians. Food wasn't so memorable though. I had the burrata salad which had a very very small amount of burrata and a lot of proseco ham - so wasn't happy with the amount of burrata given. The special pasta sounded very interesting so full marks there - it was various things plus a spattering of coffee. Food wasn't bad but just not amazing. There was also this seafood stew with truffle sauce - aroma was amazing - but a lot of cream. All in all, food was good but not out of the world amazing. Will be back though thanks to near the business neighbourhood that I am based.
5
This was my 6th visit; I remember telling the Italian owner after my first meal there, previously I was a not crazy about Italian food, but eating there had actually made me like Italian food! On this occasion, my wife and I only wanted to quick, light lunch after church on a Sunday. We ordered assorted cold cut selection (various meats), Porchetta (baked pork belly) and a brown bag of assorted homemade bread. As always, both the food and the ambience were delightful, and we even forgot to leave some space in our stomach for dessert! We left with a doggie bag of unfinished bread and cold cut after the outing, all for under S$40. Highly recommended to taste some good, reasonably priced Italian food for yourself; who knows, it may change your liking as it did for me
4
My friend recommended this place and so we tried it out. The food was great and tasted lovely. The staff were very friendly and attentive (unusual for Singapore!). There was a wide, varied menu both for drinks and food. Will definitely return.
2
Food not value the prices. At first glance dishes seems interesting even have luck of presentation, but they re not really tasty and too oily. High prices for kind of concept, more like bistrot then restaurant.
5
feel like walking into an Italian homely restaurant. we ordered quite a fair bit for just the 3 of us.we had the stuffed olives (4 small olives) , calamari pesto (grilled calamari with some basil n pesto sauce with cherry tomatoes) roast pork belly (melt in ur mouth meat but the crackling skin not Crispy) and stuffed bread with truffles and mushroom .we also had a stuffed ravioli with meat and beef gravy. for desserts we had the cannoli and lemon tart. the stuffed Camilo is the one thing we all didn't like.went back again after 3 days with hubby and we had the ribeye steak.very tasty but tat too fat for my liking.
5
IO is definitely a hidden Gem in Singapore. Run by an Italian mama the food is authentic, the place is nice and cosy and even if it's not the cheapest place in the world it's reasonably priced and great value for money. Try the porchetta or the seafood guazetto. Feels like in Italy! Thanks for this great osteria!
5
I didn't know that I could get authentic Italian food in Singapore until I went to Osteria located in Hill V2. The food is so delicious and can't have even of it. I highly recommend this restaurant if you love great Italian food esp the pizza.
5
I am the fan of Italian food and spotted this hidden gem at west area! When the first time I stepped in, it already attracts me from the atmosphere and friendly head of chef. The settings, cutleries and decorations really match with those fine dining restaurant that you can find in the city.The food that I had was great and very authentic, same as I had in Italy, not many Italian restaurants in Singapore can reach up to this level. I suggest to try the classic pasta (especially cooked with tomato, e.g.: Bolognese) and you will agree what I commented
4
Chanced into this restaurant early this year. Both hubby n I love italian food n were surprised when we realised that their chefs r Italians too! Staff who served us r also Italians. Pretty rare in Sg, I must say. Love the decor. Simple n casual. Most imptly, their food. Both of us love pasta n pizzas. Their salami pizza is awesome. This is the best salami pizza we had in Sg. Try their italian street food such as seafood in beer batter. Freshness! Will be our most visited restaurant for now on!
5
Im fan of ETNA RESTAURANT my favorite place for Italian food, but the priceless jewell this place had is OWNER AND CHEFF ANNA Today looking for her we travel 20 km To find her at IO ITALIAN OSTERIA, and as usual we didn't check the menu, just as in the Ratatouille Movie the magic word what you want to order just surprise us and what a super surprise the food spectacular and my friend just said is a happy food.We try 3 pastas 2 different beef plates we eat like our las dinner but the taste and ambience don't allow you to stop.You must give you the opportunity of pleasure your self.If I need to travel 40 Km ill do with pleasure because it worth.

Dined here with my family last night after reading an article on citynomad's page about top 10 Italian restaurants in Singapore and this was one of the top 10 restaurants. I had my doubts when I didn't see many deserving restaurants in the list but I took my chances and I regret doing so. The menu was pretty basic. There is no vegetarian option for pastas or risottos. Their pizza is pre-cooked. They just microwave it and serve it to you. I checked with the waiter before ordering as I noticed pizzas on display at their bakery section. He did tell us he will be serving a reheated pre-baked pizza which I was totally against initially but I went ahead as my wife was very insistent. I expected an oven reheated pizza but it was microwave reheated! The pizza crust was so hard and dry after all the nuking! I'm sure they're aware of the end product but couldn't be bothered, I guess. The tempura veggie was too oily and had no seasoning. The dip was tasteless. A simple arrabbiata sauce would have done the trick. The baked eggplant was just fine. I usually try either a risotto or pasta but the lack of vegetarian option here forced me to skip it. The saving grace was their desserts. My wife ordered a chocolate lava cake as the lady seated beside us ordered one and claimed it's one of the best she ever had. I asked the waiter about their best selling dessert and he recommended lemon meringue. The chocolate lava cake was fantastic. The cappuccino ice cream complemented the lava cake very well. The lemon meringue pie was very refreshing after a heavy meal. Overall, it's just an average restaurant ( I refuse to accept it as a top 10 Italian restaurant in SG!) You may try their meat and pastas but by all means, please skip their pizza
5
To my taste, this is without a doubt he best Italian I have had in Singapore. The pork belly, burrata and all of the desserts are fantastic. I go every few weeks, and plan to keep going!!Food is great, service is great, and the location is very nice as well. Highly recommended!
4
Visited this place many times...always satisfied & never disappointed with the taste of the food. Only slight disappointment with the experience some of their service staffs...heavily dependent on Italian frontline manager to take orders...

Ordered the calamari and braised pork belly for starters, turns out that the calamari is small and massively overpriced, but tasted fine. The braised pork belly, on the other hand, was too oily and wasn't crisp. As for the mains, the risotto turned out to be a lot like baked rice. The rice was mushy and was a far cry from authentic italian risotto. Absolutely disappointing considering it costs $16.The garganelli with slow braised lamb ragout turned out to be decent, but nothing really special about it. Overall experience was rather disappointing, as my family expected a lot more considering this restaurant was rated #21 in Singapore. Definitely doesn't deserve the #21 place it has been awarded

A meal at this restaurant with two young children in tow proved a delight. After a minor hiccough it was possible to order a child pizza that was delivered promptly. Adult meals were ordered and starters arrived in a reasonable timescale. There was a significant delay in serving main courses with one delayed some 5 minutes behind the other three! The 'free' potato wedges went someway to appease the service delays. The restaurant was busy but we had booked ahead. The food was good with a reasonable range of choices. The wine list is limited. The owner came up trumps offering biscuits to the kids who were getting a little fractious given the lengthy meal experience. This is a popular location and the 15 minute wait to get into what appears to be a partially completed car park was unfortunate
5
After my first visit here a few months ago, I finally got a chance to bring my family to this restaurant, as we were busy with the Chinese New Year festivities in the past few weeks.The restaurant can be packed, so its good to book ahead.Here are the highlights of our meal:- Assorted home-made bread bag: $6. We had Bread sticks and Olive bread. The Olive bread had bits of olive in them. I loved this, cos the bread is nice and fragrant. Dipping into the olive oil enhanced the flavour.- Assorted Pizza Platter: $22. We got 4 types of pizzas, with different toppings: Bacon with zuchinni, Tomato paste with oregano, Tomato paste with cheese and Italian sausage with cheese. I lovedt the bacon and zuchinni pizza most, followed by the Italian sausage with cheese pizza. - Homemade Tagliolini with Prawns: $22. The tagliolini was home-made. and its cooked with sliced half cherry tomatoes, chopped asparagus, fresh halved prawns in a creamy tomato sauce and topped with lemon breadcrumbs. Everything came together well and it has a great taste. Its good!- Porchetta: $12. Baked pork belly with wild fennel and black pepper. The porchetta is nicely cooked with nice crackling for the skin. The fennel and pepper gave the porchetta a nice flavor that was enhanced even more with the mustard sauce which I used sparingly. Must try!The restaurant has high ceiling, open kitchen, friendly staff and serves good food. What more can you ask for?Most importantly, my family loved the food and we will be back here again.Highly recommended
5
we ate here with friends who live nearby and we were blown away by the simple authentic food.everything that came out was delicious and we ended up ordering lots of starter plates as we could not decide between them. (try the pork - my friends raved about it)the restaurant was packed to capacity yet the food came out in a steady stream which suited our dining style completely.Fabulous foodFabulous serviceFabulous atmosphereHighly recommended but book if you want to guarantee a sea

I went to Italian Osteria with some business partners for a dinner and we all loved everything at this place! iO is a wonderful restaurant, we were greeted with a great respect and verve. Beyond the good dishes, well prepared and served, I was surprised, specially, by the courtesy and kindness, as well as competence of all staff. We had various delicious dishes, from the burata cheese, beef lasagna,angus beef topped with shaven parmesan and pizza, the best pizza I have ever eaten!! We can admit to be highly satisfied with the service received by iO. I hope to return soon and enjoy again the flavors of haute cuisine Italian
5
What a find!I came here with my boyfriend for lunch and we would certainly recommend, because we were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. We ordered today's special, recommended by a kind waiter: Canelloni with ricotta and spinach with truffle sauce,and calamarata with mussel and bean.We all loved pasta dishes, savoured with a glass of good house wine but the favorite part of our meal were the desserts. They have a different selection of desserts daily, my favorite is salted caramel panna cotta e hazelnut puff, really good!Furthermore the staff were delightful and the atmosphere warm and very friendly. What more could you want?I heartily recommend this gorgeous place
5
the secret of Italian Cuisine lies in its simplicity, and iO is a Master at it! You have to try a combination of different dishes together with a good wine in the sweetest Italian atmosphere! If you like a traditional Italian cuisine with refined taste and authentic and fresh ingredients, this is the place to eat them! I was awed by the ambience, the open kitchen, open ceiling with hipster hanging lights, simple wooden furnishings and the large Windows are a beautiful natural light source. Here the homey ambience is perfect for enjoying a romantic evening. The food is excellent and plentiful, also if you need serves, they have a great staff available to work. The first time I had the delicious Pizza, thin, crispy crust with a slightly sweet sauce and just the right amount of fresh mozarella. Very tasty! The second and third times I had beef fillet alla maremmana and apricot pie, so good and perfectly excuted! Give them a try!You will not be disappointed! I would certainly eat here again
5
After reading all the rave reviews about it, I was excited to get in there.Finally I went to iO with my girlfriend on Valentine's Day, and it was a Great choice!The menu emphasized on ingredients that are red in colour and that's a novel and wonderful idea! We had tasted all the dishes from menu of the day, from Citrus marinated salmon bundle with crispy vegetable, vincotto and fennel, to homemade red chili tonarelli pasta with fresh scallops, basil and zuchini wrapped red snapper, served with fresh tomato puree in aglietto sauce and, finally, a delicious dessert: Chocolate and hazelnut parfait and raspberry compote. Each dish was expertly prepared, the treatment was special and the service flawless. in other word it was a perfect evening! Thank you again, iO, for a very memorable experience.We'll highly recommend and would certainly go back
5
We showed up for dinner, 8 of us, and were quickly seated, Waiters were very friendly. Their recommendations were great. We all tried different dishes and they were all delicious. Grandma's Lasagna and the Braised Beef were succulent, and the Burrata was to die for. Their house wine is also pretty good. We all had a great evening and the prices were actually not high. The atmosphere and cuisine are really authentic Italian. Definitely a must do in Singapore
4
We had 12 pax in our group on the 4th day of CNY .. which typically not many shops are open, and we had ample space at about 11am in the morning ... (by the time we left about 12.30pm the place was packed to the brim) . Our 2nd visit here, we knew what to order, the regular stuff like Burata cheese with parma ham and rocket salad was superb but a tad expensive. We had cutlet of Veal, boy were we shocked at the size (please ask the size of any order, some can be really huge like the 1.2kg T-bone steak !) The Tiramisu was a tad too sweet else the texture was nice. Soups were always good, this time we took the potato soup. And the surprise, Beef Lasagne was superb, great texture, smooth and rich. Must Try

When I was looking for a good Italian restaurant in Singapore, this was listed in the top 10 among Italian restaurants in Singapore, even ahead of some of the most popular, best known ones.I was delighted that it was just a few blocks away from where I live. So we decided to give it a go during the recent Chinese New Year holiday break. My wife and I walked the few blocks over to HillV2, a new mall development in the Western part of Singapore where iO is located to check out this previously unheard of mall (at least to us).We were delighted with the place. The staff were friendly - mostly Italian with a few local servers. Delilah was our main server, who turned out to be the daughter of the owner, Anna. We ordered some home baked bread, the "Al Coccio" baked egg (egg with mushrooms) from the North of Italy and the chef's special of linguine with Sicialian sardines, a dish from...Sicily of course. The egg-mushroom dish was great as was the linguine, clearly both very genuine dishes from different parts of Italy. We had some Italian chardonnay with the meal. We shared the food, as we normally do. We were planning to try the other main chef special, a specially marinated salmon, but we instead chose to leave room for dessert as suggested by Delilah. We chose the special dessert of the evening, a Pasteria of ricotta cheese with whole grain rice and orange zest. That was really something special.Anna dropped by and insisted we end the evening with a chocolate liqueur to "cleanse" our palates, complements of the house. That was something special, with melted chocolate that was 75% pure dark chocolate and vodka, a concoction of Delilah that was a hit for diners.I look forward to coming back to try more of their cuisine, considering we only scratched the surface and already discovered the gem that iO is
5
It was a wonderful surprise to find this fabulous Osteria in Hillview. Tucked away in a corner of HillV2, it's like you're back in a hip Osteria in Rome. The staff ( mostly Italian ) are super friendly and service was attentive and fast.Food's great, and you find pizza Bianca like you find in Roma. We had the zucchini wrapped red snapper in a carrot garlic sauce and beef carpaccio... Fantastic lunch all round! Coming back? You betcha!!!
5
last week I went to a this new Italian restaurant, I had never been there before but something attracted me. It was the style and the open spaces, the light...maybe. but when I came in the courtesy of the people was amazing. I have never tasted such a delicious cake in my life! I swear that Lenin tart is stuck in my mind and in my dreams, it was a gorgeous sensation in every little bit... Was it its tasty and soft cream or just the pastry? Or simply them both? …I need to come back to iO to have some more and be delighted again and again

My family loves italian food, we have tried quite a few restaurants in Singapore, Batam and even Ho Chih Minh City (Vietnam). The food here is pretty authentic. Upon entering we are greeted directly by Anna Borrasi the owner and we are led to wooden benches, kind of giving a rustic feel to the new place (opened Nov 2014). We also had an Italian waiter (lives in singapore) to brief us on the complete menu and his recommendations before ordering. The Chef's choice were superb and the Burrata Cheese with Parma Ham (flown in from Italy) was superb and mouth watering with the right amount of cheese and saltishness. We also had a variety of bread and bread sticks to go with Olive oil, butter or even the soup. We had braised sea-bass which was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The risotto was also nice with the rice texture having the right blend of flavour and hardness. Tiramisu came in a little Jar, was a little sweet but we have tasted better. In general, its refreshing to have a fine dining experience away from the city areas and we would go there again. btw the Bose Ceiling speakers reproduced the music and vocals so well, we thought there was a live singer in the place !

Starters were cold and we had to ask for them to be heated; mains were very small and not pleasant; service was ok but we were a party of four and our meals didn't all come at the same time - two of us ate and then watched the other two eat; desserts were better but by that point our night was spoiled; and then the bill wasn't small either. If you think this is a good Italian restaurant you need to get out more; Cacio e Pepe just down the road on Chulin rd is far, far better in all respects

(that's how modern internet-savvy peeps say, it seems...) My wife and I enjoyed a lovely dinner at iO, after a recommendation fro a friend. We loved how the interior look - a modern open-kitchen dining space with retail parts near the front door, wooden tables with a finish that evokes a rustic set-up, and brass(?) cutlery that completed the feel. I notice that more than half the people working there are Italians, which adds to the charm as they speak with that unmistakable Italian accent.The menu is not big, but impressive with their display of Italian cuisine not necessarily found in other restaurants, with sections for breads (made on site), street food, starters, pastas, mains, and dessert. An Italian server came to us soon after we sat to introduce the chefs specials for the day, not one or 2 items, but 5!We decided to progress our dinner in 3 waves, so we started with fried stuffed olives and Porchetta, and a small carafe of their house sparkling white wine. The stuffed olives were nicely battered and fried, adding a crispy shell to this nice drool-inducing morsel. The Porchetta was brilliant!! We saw in resting on the kitchen counter was we walked in, and had determined to try that, and boy was it a good choice. Our next "wave" was Burrata and linguine with scallops. The Burrata was light, creamy and lovely. We feels there was perhaps a tad too small a serve of the cheese, considering we had a lot of rocket leaves. They used cherry tomatoes, instead of sliced ripened tomatoes, which is till nice. The linguine was a special-of-the-day, tossed-fried in olive oil with scallops and cherry tomatoes (no cream nor sauce) - very well cooked and lovely. The serving is smaller than what most Italian restaurants would serve. But, we guessed it was properly restrained to accommodate the secondi (meat course). With this, we had a carafe of their house white wine.The final part of our meal was, of course, dessert - special-of-the-day lemon tart, and Sicilian cannolis. The tart was very yum, and heavier than what we had expected. The crust was beautiful, lemon curd zingy, and the cream on top fresh and full. We loved the cannolis, especially with bits of orange zest in the ricotta filling livening up the palate. I had a nice long black, while my wife had their cioccolata (hot chocolate), which came with a side of whipped cream (so sinful, but made the hot choc oh-so-nice!!) A word about their wines. The wine list is short, and short on descriptions. But they have 6 house wine types to choose from: sparkling/dry/sweet red/white, which came in glasses, 1/4L, 1/2L, or 1L. They also had (proper) bottles of Chianti classicos, in half or 1L sizes. Proper, because these are the traditional flasks in straw baskets. May try that next time!Overall, we had a good time, and we're likely to return... perhaps with a groups of friends, then we can try their T-bone steak, which we saw many tables order to share. Highly recommended.Pricing wise, very reasonable (compared to similar restaurants)

I am always on the lookout for good Italian restaurants, as my family and I love all food Italian.This restaurant is a new concept by the owners who also own the popular Etna restaurants at Duxton and Upper East Coast Road.The unique concept about this restaurant is that it offers authentic Italian food from across Italy and does not focus on a specific region of Italy. The atmosphere here is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend’s home. The restaurant features an open-concept kitchen. When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted by chefs preparing dough for baking. They bake their own breads, with 3 types of breads available daily. Behind this station is the main kitchen, where you can see chefs (mainly Italian) preparing customers orders. You can opt to sit at the usual tables or ask for counter seats to ewatch the chefs at work. The executive Chef, Anna is really friendly and explains the tradition of the food that they are offering, with how the ingredients are sourced. Very knowledgeable and informative. Menu-wise, you will find about 6 items in each section of the menu: breads, small bites, starters, pastas, main courses and desserts. They also have chalk boards that highlight specials for the day. The menu changes weekly, so you can always find something new to dine at the restaurant.Their drinks offering is interesting. They offer their own still and sparkling water that is made on-premise, through a process of reverse-osmosis. Instead of selling bottled water like other restaurants, you can now get ‘fresh’ water ‘brewed’ inhouse! Even their own house wines is specially commissioned from their suppliers in Italy. The white and red wines are freshly pulled from the tap from a barrel and can be aerated to create a sparkling wine.We glanced at their extensive menu and ordered. Here are the highlights of our meal:Assorted home-made bread bag: $5. We had 4 varieties of breads in the bag – Bread sticks, Olive bread, Garlic & Rosemary “Fett’una’ and Traditional Roman Schiacciata, all baked in house. The bread was served warm and you can dip with the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and butter provided. I loved the Roman Schiacciata.Assorted pizzas: $19. We got 3 types of pizzas, with different toppings and the Roman Schiacciata with truffle and ricotta Cheese spread. The latter is one of the highlights of my meal. Must try!Small bites- Stuffed Fried Olives: $9. Olives that’s pitted and filled with meat, coated with batter and deep fried. Comes with a side of mayonnaise. I loved olives, so I like this.- Rice “Suppli’: $9. This was a rice ball with mozzarella middle that’s deep fried to a deep brown exterior. The rice tastes like tomato rice and is delicious. Try it!- Crispy Golden Seafood in Semolina Crumb: $9. A decent sized bowl of prawns, cut-up squid coated in batter and deep fried. Eat while its hot to enjoy the dish. - Assorted Seasonal Vegetables in Beer Batter: $9. We got strips of eggplant, carrot and capsicum coated in a golden batter. The batter is thin and I loved this dish very much. Recommended!Starters- Porchetta: $12. Baked pork belly with wild fennel and black pepper. This was very value for money. I have to pay 3 times more to savour this at other restaurants. The porchetta is nicely cooked with nice crackling on the outside. The fennel added a good flavour which I have not tried elsewhere. I wished the pepper was less, as it made the dish rather spicy. It came with a mustard sauce which I used sparingly, as the meat was tasty on its own. Recommended!Pasta- Handmade Raviolacci with meat filling: $18. 4 pieces of round raviolli filled with ‘slow cooked in oven’ beef and cooked in a cream sauce. The filling reminds me of pate and I liked this dish. Try it!- Cavatelli Burnt Wheat Pasta with Eggplant & Tomato: $24. This is a very old-school pasta that is now revived in Italy. Its my first time eating this, and it's like eating oats. You get diced eggplant with fresh and sun dried tomato cooked within. The Pecorino cheese also added flavour to the dish. Order this for something unique! Main Course- Beef Fillet “Alla Maremmana”: $28. Grilled US Ribeye steak lightly cooked on the outside with olive oil and rosemary and still pink on the inside! The steak is then sliced thinly like sashimi and plated on a bed of rocket leaves on a wooden platter. This is topped with sliced button mushrooms that has been sauteed in a cream sauce. Good stuff!Desserts- Tiramisu in a jar: $9. Served in a glass jar, the tiramisu has little alcohol in it and its topped with pistachio crumbs. Unique taste and good for children and adults!- Lemon tart: $12. We got a slice of the lemon tart that’s topped with Italian Meringue. The meringue is soft and not hard with lemon peel and have vanilla seeds folded in. Nice and tart!- Assortment of ‘home-made’ cookies: We tried the various home-made cookies. Good assortment available. Caffe- Frozen Capuccino: This is a unique concoction by the restaurant’s staff. You get a shaken capuccino in a martini glass. Nice and refreshing way to end the meal.- Espresso: $4. Restaurant's own blend of fresh coffee beans Nice.It was a great meal at Italian Osteria and I look forward to bringing my family here again to try other items on their menu soon.Recommended

My family decided to try Italian Osteria (IO) as we had heard about it from a friend.It's a good thing we made a reservation as the place was very packed on a Saturday. We almost couldn't get a carpark.We ordered the following as starters: bruschetta, fried olives, pork belly, vege soup, meatballs, fried calamari and prawns and garlic bread. For mains, we had the ribeye, spaghetti bolognaise, lasagna, gnocchi (with truffle). For dessert, we had the lava cake and the special Christmas cake called Pannettone.They have a limited selection of wine and some of them were large bottles which were on the pricey side. We tried their house pour and it was pretty decent.Loved the taste of the food which felt authentically Italian. Even the smell, friendliness and ambience of the place transported me back to Italy for a bit - which left me feeling thoroughly happy after the meal :-)We have returned for a second time since the first visit and intend to continue coming back for more its good food and friendly atmosphere

I came here last night with my girl friends, total 3 of us. This place is highly recommended by my Italian friend who stay opposite the mall. I like the rustic ambiance of the restaurant. You can smell the bread once you step in the restaurant. It has an open concept kitchen, it is quite interesting because you can see the cooking process from outside=D. We have ordered pizzas with zucchini bacons topping and with mushroom mince pork topping.There were simple yet so delicious especially pizza bread was so crispy and light. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients. Surprisingly, it is comparable to the pizza i have ever had during my last trip in Italy. It was definitely very authentic and you will not want to miss it. We have found a variety of Italian street foods and desserts on the menu. There are all from different parts of Italy. We did not try the typical desserts like tiramisu cake or panna cotta. Instead, we have chose a pastry with cream inside, sfogliatella alla crema from Neopolitan cuisine. It was not too sweet and very nice. We ended our dinner with diggestivo, lemonchello. Something you should try if you want to dine like an italian (hehe). It was recommended by a handsome Italian waiter who took care us throughout our dining there. Overall, we had a great dining experience in iO Italian Osteria. The price is reasonable with good quality food. We will definitely come back again to try other foods on the menu. It is a highly recommended authentic italian Osteria in Singapore

Was here for a casual Friday night dinner with family, and we were pleasantly surprised by the quality of this restaurant. It wasn't very crowded, given that this is a newly opened establishment. The ambience is very laid-back and relaxed, suggesting a modern high-quality restaurant with none of the traditional stuffiness and needless formality. The interior is decorated in the trendy "rustic chic" style, and you can opt to sit at the bar. Our Italian waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable, and definitely added to the authentic feel of this place. A quick glance at the open-style kitchen indicated that most of the kitchen staff were Italian as well - we knew we've come to the right place. For starters, we had the garlic bread, burrata & parma ham rucola salad, and angus beef carpaccio. The garlic bread was very fragrant, and it is clear that the olive oil used was of the highest quality. The burrata, which is a mix of mozzarella and cream, was very fresh and super delicious, pairing well with the parma ham and rucola salad. The beef carpaccio came with it's own rucola salad as well, topped with parmesan cheese shavings. The beef was tender and fresh, but it was the parmesan cheese that really stood out, as it had a surprising depth of flavour. For the mains, we had the daily specials: sea bass, and crab meat tagliolini. The sea bass was rather average, as the taste was rather lacklustre. However, the crab meat tagliolini made up for it, with the pasta cooked al dente. The tomato based sauce had a hint of spiciness to it, and combines well with the crab meat to give a refined flavour that goes well with the pasta. My only gripe is that they could've included more crab meat! Nevertheless, a fantastic meal. To end it off, we had the lemon sorbet, which was actually more of a cocktail/slushie, as it was mixed with white wine in a cocktail glass. Personally, I really enjoyed this take on the sorbet, which served as a very refreshing dessert. I tend to be apprehensive towards lemon-based desserts, as they often turn out too sour or tart, but luckily this lemon sorbet hit the balance between acidity and sweetness just right.Although the location of this restaurant may not be very accessible (nestled within the HillV2 mall), it is really worth the trip if you enjoy good authentic Italian cuisine. The pricing leans more towards the higher end, but it is still relatively affordable and in my opinion, very worth it. I foresee this place to become more and more popular in future, so it's best to place reservations in advance

The atmosphere is non pretentious, every time when I step into the restaurant, I am greeted with "Welcome Again" which is simply simple yet heartwarming. Anna never failed to wave at me from the kitchen, whenever she spotted me walking in. I was a walk in as first timer, in my jogging shorts and now I am a friend of the restaurant. This is all important, afterall it is quite a family restaurant to me. The smell of the restaurant reminded me of my sojourn in Italy, the smell in the air, it was authentic...and the taste is really down to earth authentic, simple Italian food. Every dish is prepared with 'love', (to be clichÃ© about it), or rather the passion of those who love to cook and watch the joy of those who enjoy the tinkling of their taste - buds. Each dish has its own character in taste, which is simple and authentic

I had heard about IO Italian Osteria from some Italian friends of mine, "you must eat there" they said, and they was right: a real typical italian osteria with an awesome look.! We timed our visit for just after 2pm to avoid the rush and were seated within10 minutes. It was on a table facing the windows, a very beautiful view. The waiters and the other members of the staff are so kind and polite, they were local and someone from Italy; our favourite, a young bald italian boy after laughing at our confusion helped us pick some dishes and explained some recipes, we leave a tip to him, highly capable waiter. The 1.2 kg t-bone steak was awesome, recall me the original "fiorentina" ate in Florence last holiday, perfect cooked and delicious; also the pork belly was great, according to my brother, and the linguine seafood tell us how hight the food quality is. My girlfriend and her sister take the fabulous linguine with fresh tomatoes, scallops and crispy bacon, but all the food was fantastic, we love the Italian cuisine. Here I've seen for the first time the original deserts of the "south", I've tried the "sfogliata", and my girlfriend the "pastiera napolitana", was a gorgeous experience! It is a very warm place and the food speaks for itself. We had a very good dine. I suggest you to try it, this is "la vera cucina de Italia"

For my birthday I decided to take my friends to dinner and so, persuaded by the positive reviews, I chose Io Italian Osteria and I must admit it was a great choice!My friends and I dined at the Io Italian Osteria last evening and I want to talk about our wonderful experience. Each dish was expertly prepared and was truly as much a feast for the eyes as it is for the palate.The various appetizers were mouthwatering, specially the rice arancini with mozzarella melting heart and seafood crumb; the Angus Beef, done perfectly, topped with shaven parmesan, with a side of arucola and fresh tomatoes with pesto was amazing; the Linguine with walnut pesto was awesome and finally all the desserts were absolutely delicious.We have dined here and this is by far my best experience.I will definitely return!!If you are in Singapore this is an experience not to be missed: I will highly recommend this above all to anyone looking for an upscale dining experience

Isn't the first time I have been in IO Italian Osteria in Hillview Singapore. Every time I got great food (I'm Italian an I know what is Italian food). What push me to write now is that the last visit was simply amazing. Starter and main course: chicken pate with dates and sweet sauce but what impressed me was the seabass fillet with potatoes and tomatoes. Immediately comes to my mouth the flavours and the tastes of my mother's food. I recommend this restaurant from the bottom of my heart. Enjoy!

Headed to this lovely restaurant for a special occasion, and it was fabulous. We went with a group of 6. The food was phenomenal. This is hands down a must if you like italian cousine. Our server was great, the wait time was short and the atmosphere is what you'd expect at a fine restaurant. Feel safe making your reservation here. Man, I wish I could go back

My husband and I chose iO Italian Osteria for lunch this week end and absolutely loved it.I really like the setting and decor: the atmosphere was great, service was good and fast, the food was tasty and the portions left us stuffed. We had a yummy lamb ragu pasta, porchetta, and a real pizza. All dishes were absolutely delicious, especially the dessert:a nice chocolate mousse with almonds and pomegranate.Highly recommend this place. We will be back to sample all dishes certainly!

My wife and I went there for lunch yesterday. Osterie serve simple food and wine and this place served exactly that - simple Italian food. We had porchetta, fennel soup and bollito misto - all three dishes were absolutely delicious. We will be back!

A piece of Italy outside of Italy... with authentic and tasty Italian food! I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for the real deal.

I went here with my friends and had the best Italian food I have ever tasted. Service is great, good atmosphere and the fresh bread is super yummie! Definitely a recommendation if in the neighbourhood.

A must try Italian restaurant! The atmosphere and ambience in iO is just like that of restaurants in Italy. The staff are extremely friendly, smiling and always ready to give suggestions of recommendations that are off the regular menu. There were a number of times when my girlfriend and I went there are were not sure of what to eat; we would then head to their bakery section and ask the baker to "surprise us"! haha.I really enjoy going to iO because of the great ambience, service and food. Some of the dishes that I enjoyed are:Pork Belly $9Schiacciata (special with fillings) $9Olive Bread (whole loaf) $9Customised Margeritta with toppings $9Tiramisu $9Wild Cherry Tart $6*prices are subjected to human memory errorI'm sure there were many dishes that I enjoyed but I can't remember them off hand. This restaurant is highly recommended for people who want to experience Italy in Singapore without paying for an additional plane ticket ;

IO Italian Osteria is a very great place! I have been there with my boyfriend and we found a very friendly and warm place! the food is delicious and the waiter was friendly and also very professional. If you go in Singapore visit this place and you will be very satisfied

My girlfriend and I went there one week ago. She begs me to have a lunch but I was so sceptic about an Italian restaurant in Singapore. However the excellent service, highly tasty and sophisticated viands made me change my mind on this "Italian Osteria". I recommend this wonderful place to anyone who wants to taste gold disches.
5
I'm not kidding,a really warm and gorgeous place. The waiters are polite and very kind, all you need is to ask! if you think about the Italian cuisine, the old fashioned recipes and the warmly people of the south, you are in the right place. Once you eat here, never forget it

My family visited this new HillV2 mall that just started weeks ago. Wow, finally found great Italian Food in the west area. Once you step in, you will feel the warmth welcome by Italian service staffs, then you will notice an Open kitchen with Italian chefs.We started with crispy pork belly (yummy !!), cold cuts, bruschetta with cheese & ham. Then we had Pasta with braised lamb ragout that melts in your mouth and pizzas platter which was fabulous too. We tried the Italian cocktails - Spritz (refreshing).A MUST mentioned, dessert Tiramisu in the Jar. (I dream of it every night).Food portion was just nice for us, price very reasonable considering the quality food. We will be back for great food and service. Also look out for their Chef Specials board
