I had breakfast here and ordered some egg tarts, a barbecue pork pastry, and a cup of coffee. Very good and delicious. I love the barbecue pork pastry. The coffee also quite nice. The pastry can be easily making me addictive.

Best egg tarts made in Singapore. It is smooth, soft and it tastes good. Worth to buy !!! It is located along shophouses opposite Buddha toothe relic temple.
5
Crispy pastry and delicious filling what more could you want-unless it's a char siew pork pastry which I loved as well. Well worth finding this place on South Bridge Road (just by our hotel!)
5
Had one eggtart and almond milk for under 5 dollar(if i'm not mistaken) but the taste was really great. I love the squishiness of the egg cream.. and the crust was really crunchy.
4
These local egg tarts are delightful. The pastry is crunchy. It's best to eat when it's warm/hot. Just put it in the oven before eating. So worth it. The soft pastry will become crispy again. The warm soft and creamy middle will be just oh so good.

Small confectionery tuck away in a shophouse along the South Bridge Road near to Maxwell market. Has plenty of selection for local sweets pastry and tried their famous egg tart, the crust was good, crispy but the egg custard is bit too sweet for my taste
4
Silky smooth and soft, obviously the taste is good, the signature item for the shop, had try other items like chicken flavor biscuit, lau po biscuit, as well as the Chinese Baked pastry with red beans paste, is quite disappointed, So only go for egg tart, don't waste your money on other items

I just discovered this place as I was walking by. There was a line out the door. So I stopped in and found a huge selection of sweets and more. It was only later that I read that this place is one of the top places in Singapore. With good reason.Fast, friendly service, not inexpensive though. But so very tasty.I had an egg tart only because everyone was getting them, also a mini moon cake and a golden cookie. All were sumptuous. The egg tart was different than what I was used to, more sweet and sticky, with a more crispy pastry shell. I enjoyed it, same for the other two I tried.There were a few tables to eat in or the team would gladly wrap your selections for safe travels to be eaten later.This place is a block from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple in an innocuous location on Bridge Road. Well worth seeking out for sure

My expectation was that the taste would be the same/similar to what I'm use too i.e. Hong Kong or Macau (Portuguese) type egg tarts so was quite disappointed.The egg part was a bit bland and lacked the intensity of flavours you get from HK/Macau egg tarts and the pastry was crispy which is also different from what I expected. Will try there other desserts next tim

Attracted by Tong Heng's strange old bakery look and feel. The egg tarts' high-intensity yellow, bright shiny light from the egg tarts is alluring. It's so soft that I had a hard time "managing" the crispy base. But once you bite it, you wouldn't mind eating them all. So I bought six pieces all for myself - lol.While paying at the counter, I saw the curry chicken puff next to it. It looked small and insignificant as compared to those tarts. Both cost S$1.60/ pcs. Not cheap.The curry chicken puff isn't that all fantastic in the beginning. But it has a lasting aftertaste which makes you want more. What makes those puffs so sellable? I guess it's the unique blend of curry and saltiness is rather unusual. It's unique as compared to any other (usually bigger size) curry puff with almost the same ingredients just that Tong Hong's Puff has a small piece of chicken meat, potatoes and a super small cut of a hard boiled egg contained within a small puff.Overall, I think its good if you are not picky and don't mind trying all kinds of Chinese biscuits. Also, something you might want to try - the orange, longan, and ginger dessert soup - a good choice to pair with the egg tart or curry chicken puff. Have fun

The egg tart is the one that everyone would go for. It is situated in China Town digonally opposite the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Besides egg tart, there are a variety of traditional Chinese desserts that you can try.
5
This old Chinese bakery sells an assortment of Chinese biscuits such as tau sa, lian rong and many others. The egg tarts are also pretty decent. There are seats available for you to buy their desserts to eat.
3
This place sells traditional dessert which I grew up with. They still maintain their usual standards. Nothing out of the world.
5
Found this little gem in China town the custard egg tarts are to die for. Freshly made on premises ours were still warm. A must do when in Singapore
5
Known for its delicious egg tarts. Other pastries are considered average. Go early to avoid sold-out scenarios
4
Their egg tarts are so good that its often sold out. I have been eating this since young. Should try the shortcake and walnut cookie too when you are there.
5
Favourite egg tarts in Singapore! I don't know if it's just me, but the crust totally smells like KFC. It's extra crispy with a flaky texture compared to the usual crumbly tarts. Be sure to also check out their KFC smelling Char Siew Sou that's to die for! Like all other egg tarts, best eaten fresh and warm
5
If you miss the good old days of sweet and salty cookies/pastries and the Singapore desserts of the past, Come and try it...you will never be disappointed. Great food, come early in the morning to get a seat. Small place and it gets filled up quickly. Share each cookie/pastry so that you get the most of all of the treats lined up on the shelves, including the desserts. The Almond Coffee is a winner for me and my sis! The 2 ladies serving us could do so with a smile, even in the morning at 10 am. Nothing beats a smile to start your day. But the pastries won our hearts in the end. Come on, Singapore, smile

Got to know about the famous egg tart during one of the tea appreciation. located not far from the Chinatown MRT, this small eatery allow you to sit down or take away with their pastry. I tried other pastries but not as good as the egg tart. so if i drop by here, surely is for the egg tart. The filling is slightly sweet for me and be frank I like the tart skin to be more modern pastry form. however, this is consider a good egg tart and if I want to introduce the traditional one, this will be the choic
5
It's a small confectionary shop in China Town and they do one thing better than anyone else and that's make egg tarts. Egg tarts are available all over Singapore, but these are by far the best. If in China Town, across the street from the Buddhist temple, stop in
5
Flaky, crusty, yummy egg tarts and size just right pork buns that made your eyes open wide in surprise bacause they taste really good and you wished you could have brought more home. You could go back to Singapore just to have them again...
5
the smoothest egg tarts i've ever tried. will eat it again and again. the pastries are hand made everyday too!
5
the tarts had just come out of the oven. it was hot and delicious, the custard was smooth, not too sweet, soft. the crust was more crunchy than layered pastry. the wife cakes were also good.
5
Rectangular shaped egg tart was famous in this bakery. The weather was hot, so we cool down by having dessert too. We would highly recommend this place and worth for a visit.
4
This place was mentioned by the tour guide at the Chinese Heritage museum as one of the oldest bakeries in Singapore. Their egg tarts are very rich and eggy and have a unique shape. They also have a good range of tao sah piah, all of which have lovely flaky pastry. A box of these make a good small gift
4
With a flaky crust and delicate egg custard filling, Tong Kee is probably one of the better, if not the most well-known, places in Singapore for egg custard tarts. The filling is light, delicate and not overly sweet. Some folks claim their favourite part is the crust but it can be rather flaky, so have a plate handy
4
Lovely small shop with great pastries, we enjoyed the wife cookies- a bit like a soft gingerbread cookie. You can get them with or without icing sugar ontop and they were great! Very interesting reading the history behind the cookie on the menu on the back walll of the shop as well. Wish we tried to Egg tart though, now that I see everyone raving about it
3
Was stifling hot so decided to stop for a cold drink while touring Chinatown. We were on S Bridge heading for the Buddha Tooth temple when we spied Tong Heng and they appeared busy ( a good sign) so we went in. The pastries looked fresh with a large variety and the sodas were ice cold--no ice though!!!Had a sweet and a cola/sprite, sat outside and people watched---a nice respite. Then on with the Tour--self guided

While Tong Heng is well known for their egg tarts, they also produce other seasonal yummies during the Chinese calendar year, coinciding with Chinese New Year, Dragon Boat Festival （端午节）and Mooncake Festival. One of the delicacies which they make and sell during the Chinese New Year is the traditional 年糕. Nowadays, most people buy 年糕 for decoration or as offerings to the deity. Cooking the 年糕 involves lots of work, a difficult professional job which most Singaporeans will relegate to the restaurants. However, if you are willing to put in the effort to cook the 年糕 dish personally, Tong Heng's 年糕 is probably the best in the market. While many other imported 年糕 available in Singapore supermarkets tend to be too hard or too soft, too sweet or too bland, Tong Heng's 年糕 has just the right taste components and texture. It is soft, but strong enough not to disintegrate during cooking; sweet - but not too sweet - with a tinge of the taste of red date. I would say that it even taste better than the ones you can get at the hotels. So the 年糕 is highly recommended if you are traveling by during Chinese New Year season

2 of us ordered an egg tart each and they were served warm and tasted superb! Overall, the egg tart was rich, its crust was thin and the filling was of smooth texture. We bought 3 boxes of egg tarts and char siew pastries as takeaway
5
Absolutely my favourite egg tarts in all of Singapore - get them while they're hot! There are many other interesting pastries that you can try, but the gem of the store is still the egg tarts!
5
If you have a sweet tooth, this is for you. They offer other pastries such as wafer thin walnut pastries etc.
5
I'm not much a fan of Chinese pastries. However after tried the Tong Heng pastries, we found it's very delicious. So we bought 3 boxes back to the US as a gift for family and friend. Everyone likes it as well

This egg tarts are very tasty. The pastry and custard just melts in your mouth. I assure That you will not settle for just one tart!

This is an old school Chinese bakery that's been around for more than 50 years. The star product is their diamond shaped egg tarts (these are usually baked round) with flaky pastry to die for. The tarts are filled with eggy custard not unlike what you would find in a creme brûlée. If you want to visit a traditional Chinese bakery when in Chinatown, this is the pace. There is a wide range of all the traditional sweet Chinese confectionery - flaky pastry filled with lotus paste, melon paste or a green bean paste, almond biscuits and pineapple tarts. They do some savoury items too - curry puffs (shortcrust pastry filled with potatoes and chicken) and char siew pastries (shortcrust pastry filled with pieces of barbecued pork). Apart from the baked items, Tong Heng also offers a limited number of traditional Chinese desserts called tong sui (the literal translation is sugar water). We had the almond soup and red bean soup. While the consistency is very smooth (this was particularly prized in the days before the arrival of blenders), they are quite heavy handed with the sugar. So we'd say stick with the egg tarts.The shop is mainly take out only. There are a small number of tables just outside the shop premises - savour your egg tarts here if you get to score a table.

Small bakery serving up delicious Chinese pastries at very reasonable prices. Mostly a takeaway joint, although there is limited seating available. Can't go wrong with the egg tarts - fabulous sweet eggy filling wrapped in melt in the mouth flakey pastry. The bbq pork buns were pretty good too
3
This is a nice place for a quick pit stop and to refuel when doing a tour of the Chinatown and Maxwell Road areas. They have a small number of tables running along the side of the stall, which serves mostly snacks and drinks, though some are better than others.We tried the curry puff and found the pastry to be crispy, but just too thick. The filling also did not have much meat, and tasted mostly of curry. The char siu sou, or crispy BBQ pork bun was much better, though the pastry was also on the thick side. They also sell a range of melon, lotus and red bean filled pastries, such as the wife's cake, which are quite good.We did not try the egg tarts so cannot comment on them

Went to try it 'cos bloggers and TV kept raving about it as "the best egg tart" in SG. Is it good? Yeah, I guess if you like wobbly egg custard in thin flaky pastry. But it's Chinese style. So it's not fragrant with butter and vanilla. It's made with pork lard too. So it's quite heavy on the stomach. But is it the best? I can't say... It's more of a Chinese style tart. It's a traditional Chinese bakery after all which specializes in Chinese wedding biscuits. Well it's all hand made and fresh daily so that's a plus point. It's pretty pricey at $1.60 for original and $1.80 with the coconut.It was better warm (the original I had today was warm and the coconut was cold).I would say, worth a try (traditional flavors are fast disappeared ). But is it the best? It's still a debate.

The famous rhombus shaped egg tart of Tong Heng was barely impressive and definitely overrated —— it might retain the old traditional recipe when in the old days since 1920+ with limited eggs and when sweeter confectionery was sought after, but in nowadays standard the egg tart was simply weak in egg taste and milk flavour but too sweet, while the tart shell crust was not flaky not buttery not tasty at all. The only merit is perhaps the relatively smooth filling.The rhombus shape makes the tart easy to bite, but the mediocre texture and taste won't make the easy bites worthy. Better go for HK or Macau style egg tarts. Far more impressive. And you won't regret for not having one at Tong Heng.

At $1.60 each, the egg tarts at Tong Heng aren't the cheapest snack that you can find in Singapore, but honestly, they're not expensive either. Following a recommendation, we went to Tong Heng to try their famous egg tarts. The bakery is located on the main street but can be easy to miss if you're not paying attention (guilty). As for the egg tarts themselves, they were delicious! The crust was flaky but didn't instantly crumble everywhere, and the tart itself was moist without being too oily. You won't be able to stop at one...I haven't had enough egg tarts around the world to say if these are the best out there, but they're pretty damn good and if you have some loose change lying around, why not try it
4
The crust was thin, the consistency of the custard was good but too sweet fir me, it is an expensive tart selling fir S$1.50.
3
Loved the egg tarts. Had found the quality to be consistent over more than ten years since the time I got to know about this place. Not a great sit down place. But thumbs up for the quality egg tarts over the years!
2
I've never encountered such a rude service before. Ladies at the counter were so unpleasant and pressing.
With regards to the egg tarts, dont get why there is such a fuss about them. I've tasted much better egg tarts in Singapore.
3
It's been around for decades and I am dismayed not to recommend the as the standard is deteriorating. If one has never tried may be impressed by the deco, ambience and variety but if I grow up eating it and these days I seldom buy unless friend wants to try. The price is ridiculous as I could get the similar product 20% cheaper elsewhere and the quality is consistent. The specialty is egg tarts but most times it is too sweet and the barbecue pork pastries are equally sweet. Try if you have very sweet tooth.

The first bite into a piece of egg tart from Tong Heng and already an impression was created for us. Traditionally, Chinese egg tarts are made with shortcrust pastry and many true old school bakeries still make them this way. Over the years, many bakeries gradually started making egg tarts with puff pastry. The diamond-shaped Chinese egg tarts at Tong Heng look like they are made with shortcrust pastry. Take a bite into the pastry and there's an element of surprise there. The pastry is made up of thin, flaky and crisp layers that make up the shell of the tart. It's a perfect balance between shortcrust and flaky puff pastry. The crust is what makes Tong Heng stand out. Truly, these egg tarts are one of the best we will probably have in a while

Tong Heng is located on the South Bridge road. The shop is just near the famous Relic temple in China area. I tried the Chinese pastry called "pia" stuffed with mung bean. The flour layer is very thin with lots of of mung bean inside. Great taste, have a try
4
Whether for family consumption or a party gift, Tong Heng pastries are a delight to many.Egg tarts are arguably the best in town. I like the coconut egg tart too.Others include the red bean and lotus paste pastry that are crispy yet not too sweet.However, the steep climb in prices is quite worrying. It seemed like just a year or two ago that the egg tart was just 90 cents. Now $1.50
4
My grandpa introduced me this shop n this egg tart already had about 90 years of history in Singapore. Im an egg tart lover, but this shop will be the first with the diamond shape egg tart! I had tried it 2 years ago n here i go again..Compare with 2 years ago which my first trial i think that the smell of the egg had decrease that day i only can smell the heavy oily buttery smell but it still taste good for me.. we also had the almond paste, red bean soup n egg pudding (炖蛋) it's good! Enjoying some peaceful time in the busy city -- Singapor

This pastry shop specialises in Cantonese pastries, including egg tarts, coconut tarts, century-egg puffs, "wife's biscuits" (a traditional dowry item for Cantonese weddings) etc.The shop has been at the same location in Chinatown ever since its founding four generations ago and has stuck to the same, time-tested and traditional recipes and baking methods. It is currently run by the great grandchildren of the founder and the pastries are still prepared manually/by hand.Most people buy the pastries to go, although there are a few tables for you to sit down and enjoy the pastries with a cup of coffee or tea.During the major Chinese festivals (e.g. New Year, Mid-Autumn and Dumpling festivals), the corresponding food items (steamed cakes, moon cakes and wrapped dumplings) will be sold on top of the standard pastry items

If you like tarts with crusts that is not easily flaky and too crusty (skin crust keep dropping), this is the best tart in the whole world! esp when it s just baked from the oven!It s unique egg tart is the one with coconut shreds, which is sinfully sweet yet tantalizing (while my tongue frolicked with its long shreds of coconut, it s making me nutssss...)i gulped down 4 tarts at one good! For goodness sake, i m health-conscious, but when it comes to facing them, i surrender myself to the yolk......"Wrap me with the fat/yolk"Forget about the remaining products, it is just OK... if you are a budget traveller, you may find a tart of S$1.50-1.70 exorbitant! Nevertheless,it s really worth the effort!i have a friend who always thought that crystal jade or famed tim-sum restaurant used to provide good tarts, she was caught offguard with the awesome "magic" by this tart!!!!!!!!! Pls do NOT expect any service, as the service staff are all bakery assistants....they are busy with the kitchenLimited seats too, so just pack and go! (if not, avoid peak period in order to find seats)i VISIT this shop on a monthly basis as i m a singaporean...a must-recommendation to all foreigners as well as singaporeansHow fortunate we ar
