All I can say is it is awesome! The best laksa I have tried. The price and serving is really reasonable. Whenever I craved for laksa this is the place to come.

Came just before lunch time, no queue. Don't allow to add corkles. Gravy/soup was tasteless & watery. Taste a little "green", think the chilli paste wasn't fry enough. Don't have enough of dried shrimps. Standard has dropped drastically since last visit.

Our never get tired of Laksa that satisfy our crave.
Pair laksa with the pohpiah next door will be the best combination!! If not enough the dessert store will also help to quench the fire in your belly!! 2 Thumbs up !!

Usually there is a Q at this place but thankfully on our recent visit, only a few people were in line and we managed to get our laksa fix.

Compared with 328 katong laksa, the soup is more sweet and spicy and the rice noodle used is not easily broken, and the price is just half of them, there is a long queue at night, you should try this when you are in yishun

My best friend made the best laksa & this stall here is in par with her culinary hands. I will make a visit there every 2-3 times a month for a well deserving treat. With extra cockles and tau kwa.., now that worth the calorie gain

Thick flavorful broth, hefty amounts of toppings including hard boiled eggs. The taste is just behind Sungei Road as far as comparing popular hawker laksa stalls go. The stall is walking distance from the Yishun MRT station, however Yishun is a bit far from the city center so travel time needs to be taken into consideration (for tourists)

Old style laksa that i truly like. Their fresh cockles (80% raw is the best-for me), fish cakes, dried toufu,beansprouts, hard boiled eggs and bee hoon. The laksa gravy was light and rich with fresh coconut milk, chilli and its lots of dried shrimps that made the gravy very yummy! There is Chili paste to add to the laksa to add more spiciness.Normally I didn't finish the whole bowl of gravy but I clean up my bowl of laksa tonight.

They are not open on Sunday! I can on a Saturday 4pm and they are still open! They don't allow to add cockles anymore haha but it's fine ! Love the laksa soup very strong hei bi Bian taste! It's not air condition so it's pretty warm plus the Hot bowl of laksa ! You can also order dessert beside the laksa shop
