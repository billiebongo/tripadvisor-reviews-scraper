Great Italian food at affordable prices ranging from pasta, pizza and desert.
Main course was served within 5 minutes but desert was only after repeated calls for it to be served.
Besides, drinks were free of charge.

To be honest, this is not the first time I had dine at Saizeriya and I had finally sat down to give this review. While Saizeriya is Japanese, they serve Western food here. And to that, in a very Japanese style. You will find a wide range from pasta to steaks and you can find some rather exotic eats such as squid ink pasta and escargot. The drinks are really cheap, $2.80 for drink buffet with unlimited top up from the drink bar consisting of soft drinks, tea, coffee and more. If you do not take that, the ice / warm water is still free though. How many restaurant charges ridiculous prices for that nowadays.The food is very good in fact for very low prices. Pasta range about $7-9 and steak a little bit more. But there are lots of choices and all very localized selection. I usually prefer to try the more exotics ones like squid ink and escargot mentioned above and they are both very food. And the portions are really generous too. I usually still make the mistake of over ordering, where in fact they main dish are quite filling to be honest
