Hi There,Visited this newly opened outlet at Biopolis after seeing their ads.the location is bit inconvenient if you are taking MRT or Bus, You need to walk almost 1Km to reach the outlet. Nearest MRT is Buona Vista. Ok so moving on to food. When we entered the restaurant there was only one table occupied it was eve of public holiday.we ordered black pepper Mushroom. It was just awesome. We then ordered triple treasure vegetable in garlic sauce and Yeng chow fried rice. Both dishes were quite decent. Triple treasure in garlic sauce could have been better as it lacked punch of the garlic sauce since it was quite mild but over all it was good. After main course we ordered sizzling brownie with vanilla ice cream. The brownie was a bit sticky like chocolate dough. It wasn't upto the mark at all. Overall the experience was good. I would rate food -3.5. Ambience- 4. Service -3. I hope to visit again and try their non veg dishes.
