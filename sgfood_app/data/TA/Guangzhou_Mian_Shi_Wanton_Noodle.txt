Living abroad there are many dishes I miss from Singapore. But the first thing I have to have is the wanton me from here. Simply the best. Just writing this review is making me want to go there!

If you are around the Tanglin Halt area and hunger pangs hit you, you can visit the Tanglin Halt Market, where this wantan boodles stay open till late. You can identify the stall easily, with the constant queue of people waiting in line for their noodles.The queue moves quickly and the stall owners take and process your orders quickly, so you need not worry about waiting too long for your food. I usually order the larger set, as it comes with more noodles and additional char siew. You can order additional wantans if you like. I find their large serving to be very generous and more than what you will get from other stalls for the same price. Thumbs up for that
