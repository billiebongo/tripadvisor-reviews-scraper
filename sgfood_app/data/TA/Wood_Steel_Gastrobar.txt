Boat are kind of shaky. Not recommend if you have motion sickness. But they provide medicine as well. Food variety so so but taste was okay.

A unique environment. Gives a feel of being on a cruise but not leaving the pier. They provide sea sick pills for those who get seasick.. but its still better for them to sit at the upper deck.

Dishes are quite pricey so the food portion can be a little bit more. Those who get seasick I do not recommend but if you want to come here just for drinks with friends, the atmosphere is quite nice.

Good foods and good service. The ambience was good, live band starts at 8pm on Saturdays. Good view of MBS, good for friends gathering. Ordered garlic chicken wings, beer and others. Would come back again in future.

Service was really good and the view from the upper deck was nice. But it was a nauseating experience as the boat swayed from side to side.

It was a great experience. the boat did move slightly and it was quite an exciting experience actually. I mean come on, we go on board to a restaurant on a boat which is floating, we definitely would have to expect the movements. So be prepared and enjoy it!

The staff who served us that night were absolutely lovely! Told us about the history of the barge. We really enjoyed the atmosphere and found the experience of being on a rocking boat very fun. Worth the visit down to Marina Bay South (it is convenient via MRT).

Known of this restaurant through Groupon and made a reservation- staff were short handed that day but were friendly, helpful and prompt to our needs. It drizzled halfway while I was dining, but the staff were quick and alert in helping to move us under shelter. Food was good, service was great, ambience is excellent with brilliant live singing. Will definitely be back again
