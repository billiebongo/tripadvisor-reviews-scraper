Prices are cheap but the food is very blunt and very average. If you looking for a cheaper option it's ok for a quick meal.

Food was quite interesting, catering for both Asian and Western palettes. Wide and varied menu from conchs and squid to fish and chips and pizza. Very tasty. Pleasant and attentive staff.

I stayed at Village Changi Hotel and Rasa Rasa is right around the corner. I had a hamburger- with a fried egg on top (don't they all?)- and a mango smoothie that was awesome. Table service is quick and they take credits cards.

The attraction is the 3 crabs for $25. However since we want a different flavour for each crab, they allowed us to do that with a $5 top-up. Typical Chinese style of cooking and we have not issue with that but probably a little spicy for the chili crab. Spaghetti ordered by my two gals were very dry. Sausage pizza was good and so was the nasi goreng kampung.Overall okay and good place for a family meal together because of the varieties of dishes.

We were there on a Sunday for an early dinner. The menu was overwhelming, lots of varieties and we were spoilt for choices, even for the drinks and desserts. The seafood was very fresh and price was reasonable. The servers were also very friendly. I especially love the deep fried butter squid. Yum

We stayed at the nearby Village Hotel Changi, so it was a takeaway order for us. The choices available is aplenty with huge range from malay, chinese, western and indian. We ordered butter chicken and a few selection of fried rice. Kids love it. The butter chicken is awesome. For SGD8, it comes with rice and can easily make 2 hungry person full. Recommended

This place is located bang on the main street along with other small interesting cafes and restaurants, in this quiet, clean and calm neighbourhood of Changi Village....a minute's walk from the Changi Village Hotel.It's open till late and serves a variety of awesome cuisines. After having a few beers at Bambooze, the cafe/bar next door, I decided to grab a bite here as I found this place buzzing with tourists, travelers and locals even at 1 am, which suggested that the food was good. I took a glance at the other tables to see what people were eating and if this place was famous for anything. I realized that this place was more of a Malay place and I'm not a huge fan of Malay food as it's too greasy. Then I saw a long 'beef this' and 'beef that' section in the menu and immediately ordered a couple of beef starters, and as expected it was too greasy. Now the next night I was returning from the G'N'R gig and saw Bambooz open so stopped for a few more beers before calling it a night. So post my beer binge I was super hungry but too tired to look for other food places at 2 am and this place was buzzing. So I decided to spend a little time going through the menu and spoke to one of the guys taking orders about their food. I'm glad I did!I ordered Beef Siumai, Beef Chili Cantonese style, Beef noodle soup and steamed rice and lots of chillies. I can safely say that this was one of the best meals of my entire trip!I am going back for the Beef Noodle soup. It comes in my dreams

Personalised service from the owners and scores of attentive waiters. A range of food from local to Malay to Chinese to Indian. The menu is huge and comprehensive, so much that one simply is boggled by what to order. The quality of the food is excellent and prices were extremely reasonable.We ordered a variety of dishes to share and it was so much that we could not finish all. The garlic naan was especially good.A fantastic time with friends. Halal with salaah facilities. Highly recommended. What was of interest was that they had a sign up that said during the month of Ramadan, Muslim clientele has preference to getting their food first - that's the first time I saw such a sign in a restaurant
