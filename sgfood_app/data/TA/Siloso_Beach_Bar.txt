Great choice of light lunches and snacks, beautifully prepared and presented in a bright and sunny location. This was our main focus at lunch time

Basic and cheap. (pizzas, chips and salads etc) Helpful staff but too hot to eat there for me - I prefer indoor with aircon!! The young ones didn't mind the heat --

Enjoyed happy hour specials on 24 oz Tiger beer, buy 1 get 1 free. Had a great time. Service was good and the area was nice. Be prepared for the heat and humidity.

we tried the food at the hotel pool bar twice during our stay at the Shangri-La. The hot dog was nothing special but the Satay was fantastic, due to the peanut sauce. well stocked for drinks.

Not the fastest service but after you order you can go for a swim.
Food is good, lunchtime portions, my husband loved the king prawns on ice. Great variety of tropical alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages but don't expect fast service

Nice good fast food snaks, drinks, fresh juice drinks, served at the beach while relaxing on beach chairs.

Located by the Pool at Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa, easy access to food and drinks without leaving your pool side lounge. Some days I just did not want to leave.

This is the place where you would love to spend an afternoon cooling off in the pool with a beer. Must try the french fries and cheesy fries here. The most crispy and delicious fries I have ever had. Of course there is also a wide selection of liquor so you can cool off by the poolside with a beer or a tropical cocktail, whatever you prefer. Awesome place, although it can get a tad crowded out here at times.

Having walk some trails on Sentosa we found our way down to the beach area and this lovely Bar. The can of Tiger Beer was very refreshing as was the Iced Lemon Tea. It started to rain so we stayed for another drink and eventually decided to eat. Food was excellent and the staff most helpful and friendly. The owner is very recycle aware and has made lovely containers from old plastic bottles making the place very attractive with the lovely plants growing in his works of art.

Previously there used to be a chef based at the pool bar.However, the pool bar kitchen is now closed. All food orders now go to the main kitchen, which often leads to unnecessary delays and mixups.Jeremy at the pool bar remains one of the more attentive and pleasant staff to deal with - cheers and thanks Jerem

Certainly a pool bar that rates very high. Great selection of food to eat around the pool, and a full selection of drinks.
As usual, the service is second to none.

The choice of food is not very rich here, but its quality is on the high level. Prticularly, I could recommend Caprese salad. It is fantastic!

A lovely place to sit and relax while watching the kids in the pool. The drinks are a bit pricey and the service is slow.
Best to make use of the happy hour.

The food was great, the kids enjoyed it and we were all able to relax around the pool while having lunch.
Exactly what we wanted while on holidays.

This place is very effective and delivers food and drinks very fast. The food is good, although the prices are a bit on the high side.

Romantic pool with bar next to it. Children will love the kids pool. Food and drinks are great. We enjoyed it since we were staying in hotel, wonder if its open for outsiders

Terrible customer service, no staff walking around taking orders. No effective methods to get attention of any staff. No swim up area, you have to leave the pool to go and order. The cocktails were OK, nothing worthy of this 5 star hotel. It's noisy and the staff are apathetic. This needs a solid makeover, it just feels like it's tacked on to the pool area with no vibe, no music. The best way I can describe it is as a lazy bar. Throw some lounges in the area with some coffee tables, some cushions and a decent barista and this would be a great start. Overall, it's a bit flat with no atmosphere, it's certainly not 5 star

We ordered some food and drinks while hanging by the pool. Chicken wings were amazingly delicious. Not sure about the blue cheese sauce which was chunks of blue cheese in a white sauce, but the wings were exemplary. Had a couple of rounds of caprioshkas as well, which were also delicious. Prices as to be expected at a resort. We thoroughly enjoyed.

The beach bar at the resort is fantastic and so convenient. While you are sitting on your beach lounge the staff walk around and take your lunch orders and deliver them to you. The food is yummy and perfect for lunch. We didn't eat dinner from here and I'm not sure that its even open for dinner, but for lunch - perfect!
