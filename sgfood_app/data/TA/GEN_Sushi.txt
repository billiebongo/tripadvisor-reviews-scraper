HiThis one is not to miss with good value for money. Considering Singapore, dinners are usually more ripped-off than awarded to pay a visit to the restaurant. So, this one can change the custom...dinner for three persons (soft drinks) 5-6 dishes shared..we paid 95sgp..and this is not fast food, food court or hawker or voucher deal..just walk in..food taste great and very much I was getting in Japan..so go for it :)
