We had 5 lovely lunches here today. We sat in the air conditioned part with 4 tables which was very nice given the heat today.

Food is decent and interesting ( they got fusion dishes that are a mix of local favorites and western food like Mee Goreng Pasta) if a bit pricey. A bit inaccessible.

Gardenasia was recommended from my car navigation system as all natural restaurant and I enjoyed the salad and mushroom soup! Bring some more time to walk around the whole place.
I personally prefer the Poison Ivy restaurant at Bollywood Veggies around the same area.

Located at an ulu part of Singapore, this place is good for getting away from urban parts of Singapore. Relaxing atmosphere but do not expect too much from the food here. Just enjoy the peace and break from horns and crowd of people.

I was amazed by the food I had, Ribeye Hor Fun and the Salad Bowl were fantastic. Situated in the suburb area of Singapore, its a perfect place to chill with my friends over beer too. Highly recommend this bistro!

This last minute arranged staycation turns out to be such fun! Great landscaping, beautiful colonial-inspired villas...most importantly as I've observed in my travel stays, it's the people running it that makes the biggest difference. In this case, our host Aga was most accommodating to take in our last minute booking request, ensured that we are adequately taken care of and was a fun fishing companion for our kids.Thank you Aga!

Have passed by this place many times and this time my husband and I decided to go in and have a try. Since it is only open on weekends, we decided not to miss it.We have made the right decision. The environment is quiet and peaceful. There are air-conditioned and non air-conditioned areas to sit in. We chose the air condition one as it is on the afternoon and it's more comfortable to enjoy our lunch in an air-conditioned room.The food is tasty, presentation is nice too. I love the ceasar salad and the seafood platter. They also sell beer, quite a number of varieties. Price wise, reasonable with that kind of food standard and environment. Will definitely be back again!Wonderful place to dine in and will definitely visit again

We arrived on a Saturday night and the place was pretty empty although it did fill up slightly. It has a nice ambiance, overlooking their fish pond. We had the make your own salad which at $18 is pricey for only 4 toppings. But it does come in a huge bowl! I had the chicken which was cooked very nicely. Worth trying some of their teas, aloe juice etc as they are made from the produce off their own farm! Decent.

Love this place. Quietly nestled in the green lungs of the Kranji Farming countryside, the bistro is a great place to escape to if you want to avoid the hustle and bustle of the big city. The food was awesome, but more so the atmosphere! Kudos to the guys behind Gardenasia who created a little haven in this seemingly far-out, other-worldly place which would have been just a farming area with little to offer the city folks like us! We often compare our experiences at places like this with what we've grown accustomed to in Australia (since that's where we spent a good three years). I tend to think that farms here in Singapore have a lot more to offer in terms of having accompanying retail spaces or a F&B wing that could be co-located within the farms and from which they could turn all sorts of fresh farming produce into a diverse range of novelty items (think strawberries and their conversion into strawberry ice cream, strawberry facial cleansers, etc) and fantastically fresh meals! Here at Gardenasia, I must say I'm truly impressed. They serve a wide variety of fresh salads from produce that they obtain from the farms around the area as a key feature of their menus. The dining experience is further augmented by a wonderful environment to just sit around, enjoy the lunch and the friendly banter with friends and family, while at the same time enjoying the luxurious access to fresh clean air. Save for the mosquitoes (that's an inevitable drawback of our countryside), the place felt un-Singaporean. We enjoyed the place so much that one of these days, we're going to take the family out for a farmstay at Gardenasia too
