Food was excellent. My friend and i ordered omellete with tomatoes, sweet sour fried pork, long beans.
Price is affordable. We will be back for more.

Ate there last night and had wonderful food. Definitely worth trying. All was as good as we expected. Very affordable.

Back again and 3 new wow dishes. Green onion pancake (to be bevoured when warm), simple pork rib with green bean and potatoes, and dried bean curd skin with green chilli. Each dish was (quickly) well cooked and so tasty.No queue at 2pm on Saturday.

Dongbei-style food is by far my favorite Chinese cuisine and when I found this place in Singapore I was over the moon. Reserved a table as I heard it can get quite busy. Rightly so, people were waiting outside for a table for quite some time. The inside is very basic and there’s both a downstairs and upstairs seating area. Service is quite good and the staff is attentive enough. The menu is a blend of Dongbei food and Szechuan food - two food styles which I personally don’t think go well together (one is very spicy and the other one isn’t). Ordered my standard dishes - eggplant, green beans, dumplings, salad and sweet and sour fish. The eggplant was surprisingly bland and the green beans had too much chili and no meat. Dumplings with pork and leek were a bit on the sour/bitter side and the salad was okay. The sweet and sour fish didn’t have much flavor either. Maybe I had my expectations too high - and my local Singaporean friend loved it - but I found it to be quite average at best.

If you are a visitor to Singapore you should try this place. OK the sign is in Chinese and it is basic inside but the photos should make it tempting. Go in, choose a number from the English menu and enjoy some very hearty and tasteful food with excellent service. Been here several times now and not had a bad meal .... beware of biiiiiiiig helpings.

The restaurant was easily found, just few minutes from Chinatown MRT, but it was small and we needed to wait for about 15 minutes to be seated. Service was very fast with friendly staff. Portion was large so please be prepared! All the dishes we ordered had chilli which were quite delicious though they were oily at the same time. Price was affordable, not expensive actually

Discovered this little restaurant accidently and went back another time. Nicely prepared Sichuan dishes at small prices (mine were around $12). I tried the double fried pork with veggies & morels and chicken with peanuts & chilli sauce - beautiful. Would come back any time. Note that it gets quite busy in the later evening and because of the acoustics the noise can be a bit distractive

The dumplings were delicious. I also had the chicken with peanut sauce and chili (known to me as kung pao chicken). I wasn't ready for the level of spicy this bad boy had. The spice of the combined red and green chili was ripping through me. Yet I finished it. This food is for the spicey loving people out there and not for the cry babies like me. Anyhow after having it I ordered the candied sweet potato which was quite a treat! Dont forget to dip it at the cold bowl of water since they serve it extremely hot ( hot in the sense of temperature and NOT hot spicy) for it to become literally candied. The extremely hot sugar coating might burn you so be cautious and vigilant! also got the little chewy glutinous ball with sesame filling which had the right amount of filling and sweetness

Don't expect luxury dining, as the setting of the restaurant is bare minimal. But the quality of the food more than makes up for the environment. Lots of Chinese come here, and the must try dishes are guo bao rou, gan bian si ji dou and la pi. not forgetting the delicious cong you bing, I can never get tired of this place

After watching a Fung Bros Food YouTube video on Dongbei food I wanted to try some. As well, one my Singaporean colleagues is from Dongbei. I stumbled upon this place while zooming in on a map of Chinatown. You will need your smartphone map: the sign outside is only in Chinese characters. There is an English menu, but it does not include all of the dishes (next time I visit will be with my Dongbei colleague).I ate here twice in one week: Saturday lunch; Thursday dinner. Arrived 1905 Thursday, it was packed and boisterous. Everyone was really enjoying their food. My meal on Saturday was one of the best cooked most flavorful Chinese meals that I have EVER eaten. I am dreaming of it as I write this: green beans with chili and garlic; spicy chicken with peanuts. Green beans were at that perfect cook where the snap is gone and they just start to soften. Awesome combination of chili and garlic. If there is a number one Chinese side, this should be it. The spicy chicken with peanuts was a symphony of textures: soft chicken; slightly softened peanuts; still-crispy slices of carrots; and, surprise, raw cucumber. I cleaned both plates. I drank Snow beer: dry, light lager that went well with the spice.On Thursday I had the shredded pork with garlic shoots and green beans and the spicy fried chicken. Both were very good, but what I ate on Saturday was AWESOME. I will come back to eat here next time that I am in Singapore
