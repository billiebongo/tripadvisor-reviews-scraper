We had a wonderful experience dining at Blue Jasmine. We ordered Seafood Pad Thai which was full of flavour and the Larb Chicken Balls had a unique flavour to it, along with the tamarind sauce. And the customer service was top-notch!

We met here on a quiet week-night and the service was rather slow. The waiter described the portions as generous ("two or three people can share") but we had to agree to disagree. We were quite disappointed that the portions were suitable for one and had to order more portions, in order to satisfy our hunger. The food was delicious but the sticky rice for the dessert was a little too al dente. All in all, it's the little things that have let this restaurant down. Shame though

We had buffet dinner and i feel that the food are lovely authentic Thai. Price reasonably average. The Indian manager (could not remember his name)is super friendly and his hospitality made us feel welcome. They used to provide prayer room for Muslim to perform their obligation too

The food was terribly spicy and ran out of flavours. Tasted like I had to eat chili padi in all of the dishes. The cutlery was rusty and dirty. Prices of ala- carte menu was over priced considering the fact that the food wasn‚Äôt tasty at all. The male Indian staff was reluctant to serve us and didn‚Äôt even bother to provide recommendations. One of the worst experience I had in Singapore. Such a waste because the view and ambiance was nice. I would never return, definitely.

1st date night for 2018 Food was awesome.Great service from the start.Great food recommendation from the manager! Willing to share his thoughts on combination of dishes. Restaurant was able to cater to our lower level of spiciness tolerance.Overall great environment and ambience on a Sunday night

It is fair to say what we paid for is a bargain with the exceptional service rendered by the outstanding Haridas. From start to finish Haridas offered impeccable service, an asset in the service industry. Our family dinner at Blue Jasmine was a culminating experience - delectable offerings and a quality host

had great beef after a very long time ,this place really surprised me was not expecting much but a great place to enjoy your food

The waiting time for food was too long.It was not running full house and some tables were still uncleared for sometime.

Went to blue jasmine for a birthday celebration. Food was good though a little too spicy for me üòã. Nice & relax ambience. A recommended place to go!

Had dinner with wife and kid to celebrate our anniversary. The place wasn't too busy and we were ushered to our table very quickly. Saw the menu, ordered and food came promptly.
Thai food - really can taste the spices
Ordered Fish - delightful
5
It was a nice experience having lunch at the restaurant. The ambience was nice and got greeted the moment we stepped in as they were ready to receive me.
5
Back again and the food was much better. Cosy restaurant and good and simple menu. All the dishes were simple great! The basic green curry and basil beef was outstanding!! üëçüèΩ

Situated on the roof, the restaurant has a nice feel with the roof top pool and the sky in view. The restaurant is nicely decorated. The food is pleasant but the menu is very limited. Service by the regular staff is good but they are supplemented more than 1 to 1 by students part timers who are nice but are not trained and slow. Overall, it was a pleasant experience
5
The Thai halal dishes was undeniably good. The restaurant has a lovely ambience with indoor and outdoor seatings. The lovely pool is located on the same floor as the restaurant.Haridas was very accommodating and treated me and my guests well. I would also like to commend the lady who served us. She was patient and hospitable.I highly recommend Blue Jasmine for a great meal

Celebrated my wife birthday recently. We requested for a table beside the pool which has a cosy ambience. The service by the staff, both Haridas and Hisham were excellent. They even gave a complimentary birthday cake to my wife. All the dishes we ordered, were delicious. Will be back again for the good food
3
Cosy place with the pool at the side. Dinner set with semi-buffet. The portion of the main for curry with vermicelli is like kids meal as to have more food from the semi-buffet would be enough. There'a Pathai and more...to be choose from the mains too. The food was average for me but the food serving really need to be improve as I had finish 3 round of food from buffet counter, the mains still not ready
5
I booked the restaurant for a birthday lunch for my friend. The service was really good, food is great and the price is very reasonable! Must try the Mango sticky rice!!
5
Mostly excellent food but couldn‚Äôt beat the service, which was fantastic! Will definitely come back to try the buffet spread. Kudos to all the service staff for their attention, patience and professionalism.

Had the privilege of a friend who works in Park Hotel Farrer Park and she brought me to Blue Jasmine Restaurant for lunch.The high ceiling and full length glass windows, coupled with a sunny day, gives a very comfortable and spacious dining space. Street food style but this restaurant gives a twist to its taste. I like the Salmon Larb with rice crackers and the Blue Jasmine rice. The taste is interestingly nice and memorable! Recommended for anyone who wants to experience a different taste of thai food

We ordered room service the night before and had their red curry which we absolutely loved. So we decided to have lunch the next day after checking out, but the food was a little flat. The red curry wasn't as tasty as the night before. The other dishes didn't really stand out. Portions were generous though. Although they were not busy, they weren't very attentive nor prompt in their service
5
Been here twice and both times weren't disappointed!I love the improvements they have made for the dessert option where we can now have a larger portion of the delectable sticky rice with mango or durian cream!The dishes are all delicious and you must try the Holy Basil Chicken, Beef noodles and of course, the Tom Yam soup!Service is beyond expectations. Haridas, the manager i believe, was very welcoming and spoke proudly of his team. Blue Jasmine is truly one of the best Halal Thai restaurants aroun

2nd time eating at this new restaurant at one farrer park hotel. We went on a sunday, so the restaurant only serves ala carte dishes. There wasn't so much menu list to select from. But if you are a thaifood lover, this might just be the one you are looking for. You can come on thursday to saturday for a buffet style where there will be much more options. However, i like the ambience and cosyness of the place. Nice for you to chill out with ur partner or friends.

Heard about this recently opened eatery (about 6mths I think) at the Park Hotel Farrer Park and mixed reviews were posted online and I knew I had to give this place a try..So best time to visit is of cos on my birthday! Conveniently located above Farrer Park mrt station and took the lift to 5th level and was greeted by a nice and cosy ambience! Food was awesome and my personal favourite would be the Dancing Crispy Sea Bass and the Green Chicken Curry with Blue Jasmine Rice! while dessert had to be the Mango Sticky Rice! Maybe next time I will try the Red Ruby! Currently they are having great promotions and too many to mention but I do know they are offering Buffet Dinner from Thursday to Saturday! May check their website for the promos! You may choose to sit outside too but on this humid weather ok guys! Maybe at night.. In addition to make it a sweet and memorable time when the friendly crew named Yen (if I got it correctly) and the Manager Mr Haridass came out with a birthday cake with a Birthday song which was very sweet of them! We had great time chatting and sat almost 2 hours there! I will definitely recommend this place to any of you who wants to have a nice cosy lunch or dinner in a hotel restaurant with a reasonable price! And to both Yen n Mr Haridass thanks for making my day a sweet and memorable one!

I recently dined in Blue Jasmin for a birthday celebration and was amazed by everything that they served. From the ambience, the service, the food, the staff, it was above expectations. The staff were very accommodating to our last minute request and they were always on their feet to ensure that the customers were having a pleasant experience.
5
Back here again for another yummy Thai dinner. Tried almost everything of their Thai dishes. One word to describe,great!Very reasonable priced too! Loved it where you can get to enjoy the pool view if you are being seated near to the pool.Staff including the manager,Mr Haridas displayed excellent customer service together with his team even when it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s their busiest time at Blue Jasmine.Definitely will be back soon

Try to make a habit to write a review of outstanding service whenever possible. It will only do justice to the individual or team involved. He/ they deserve the recognition as the world reads the post.This first visit to the restaurant left a deep impression from the excellent service provided by Hisham (hope my eyesight did not fail me reading his name tag). The elderly server was candid over our food selection and provided suggestions since we were a party of fifteen with children and senior citizens. Food was great. At the end, he went beyond the call of service by offering us a discount for the meal (he was definitely not obliged to do so as an employee). The small act imprinted a positive impression to return.Hisham, please keep up the level of service. We shall return soon

Beautiful setting and interesting Halal Thai cuisine. Dishes I liked are: the salmon larb, petai, & fried fish. Desserts were good too especially if you like durians.
3
The ambiance and the service staff were amazing. The food was mediocre for that kind of price point. I was a little disappointed that their buffet spread was not made available everyday.
4
Staffs are very friendly and warm. They offer suggestions on whether to have buffet or ala carte dinner. They even invite us to look at the buffet spread. The food are not bad. Love their desserts. They are so good.
4
Still very good after few visit. Will RTE again soon with friends.
Buffeut pricing abit steep. Hope have some promotion
5
Food was good. Portion was large. More than enough for 2 ppl. Service was excellent. Will definitely be back to try the buffet!
*Mango Sticky Rice is a must try.
4
A good place for Thai food. The staff is very good but the service is slow. Nice place to try Thai food near little India. Raw mango salad was exceptional.
5
The overall experience is great. Good customer service and warm staff. I will definitely return to the restaurant!

Food is unexpectedly tasty and authentic. Quiet place with no crowd as it is a new hotel (4 mths old). There's currently semi buffet going on at $29.90++ which we find is worth the price!

Avoid this place unless you have nowhere else to go. The restaurant is set inside a hotel packed with group tours. So if you are going up from the lobby using the elevators, be prepared for a long wait and big squeeze.Once you get inside the restaurant, you will see the way overpriced menu, featuring both a la carte or buffet prices. The spread for the buffet is so little it was pathetic. Food was mediocre.This place was a ripoff, the only reason that it is still around is probably because of the helpless tourists that got pushed over there

Ambience of the restaurant is comfortable, not cramp - spaciousService crews are friendly, especially Mr. Yen.We ordered:Starter: Pomelo salad ($12), Larb Salmon - salmon tartar ($18)Carbo: Stir friend Phad Thai Goong ($16), Stir friend Glass Noodles ($16), Crabmeat Pineapple Fried Rice ($18)Soup: Red Tom Yum Prawn Shop ($20)Meat/Fish: Basil Beef ($26), Orange Curry of Stingray - very unique taste ($24)Dessert: Mango & Sticky Rice - portion is huge, advice to share ($14
