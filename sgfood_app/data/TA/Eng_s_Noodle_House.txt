you get what you pay for. Great meal for either lunch or dinner and fast service.
come before 1200 to avoid the crowd

The noodle texture is different compared to the other noodles in Singapore, definitely stand out from the crowd!

1. Rude service staff. Very rude.
2. Mediocre noodles at best. Just milking on its brand name for now. There is no shortage of alternatives; you will very likely get better noodles at more reasonable price from perhaps any hawker centre wanton noodle stalls

Have been eating this Wonton noodles since 1991when they were at the 2nd floor of Dunman Hawker Centre. Since they move here the standard has been slowly declining. When you order the dry version, the noodles are lumpy and hard, no effort in tossing and mixing it up well like before. Only the chilli has maintain it s standard

As the tile says, the taste is very good, but they must use a lot of MSG. too bad, really! The setting is simple and functional, this is a place to sit down and have a bowl of wanton mee and then leave. no place to meet friends for a get together. They only have a small menu: wanton mee dry or in soup or fried. tried the dry version. The large order was rather medium sized compared to other places, and at $5.50 on the expensive side. Also unusual is that the wanton are served in the noodle bowl rather than in the soup on the side, but fine with me as long as the wanton are steaming hot - they were. I loved the place until an hour or so later when my mouth was dry and had that typical MSG aftertaste... and I am not someone who is particularly picky about MSG in food.Will not return due to the heavy hand on the MSG

I like the boiled wanton and soup version of the wanton mee. The dry version has a slightly different taste (both noodle and soup), you should try both. But I don't like the taste of the super hot chili sauce, I still prefer my wanton mee to go with green chili. Noodle taste totally different from the normal wanton mee from hawker center, so I can see why the price is higher since they make their own noodle. That will link to the remarks from other reviewer that the portion is small. The noodle texture is comparable with Soi 19 wanton mee I ate in Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre. Worth to try during off peak period

This large bowl of wanton noodle with pathetic amount of thinly sliced char siew + 5 small boiled wanton costs $5.50. I quite like the texture of the noodle which is different from the usual, more springy. However, I wouldn't return as it is over-priced.The 8 small fried wantons costs $3. Just some ordinary fried wantons
3
Come early before the lunch crowd, only serve wanton noodles and wanton soup. Noodles come without black sauce but Chilli paste that you decide to put your self from your table. Not so great as I prefer the traditional black Color wonton noodle in malaysia style

A Friend brought me to eat this and then noodles were decent. There was great and spicy Chilli as well. The point is I went to take out twice. The first time they refuse to give me extra Chilli as they claimed I only ordered small. I ordered 4 packets and was given 3 packs of Chilli. The second time I ordered large and they still said it's only one pack of Chilli per order !!!!!!! And the PRC guy started scolding me for simply asking for an extra pack of Chilli ? I asked nicely too and both times I didn't take extra anyway. The reason is becos it's tasty that's why I politely asked if I could have one extra pack. Atrocious. Never going back.

Chinese immigrants to Singapore brought wonton with them and through time wonton evolves into wonton noodle. Eng's offers an authentic and decent version at a reasonable price. Personally, I prefer the original Chinese version.
4
It is one of my favorite local noodle shop in Singapore.
They have very limited plates but very addicted.
Order wantan noodle and lime juice.
2
Noodles are nice and chewy.. but the rest are poor. Meat is tough, Chilli has strong chemical taste.... skip !
5
The best wanton noodle I've ever had so far. The fried wantons with mayonnaise is the best! Lastly the chili sauce is just so hot to resist from it!
5
Beware of super hot chilli.. and it is true.. noodle is good but char siew just average. The wanton is also abt above average. Overall still very good nonetheless
5
I have been to Malacca and Penang, and have not had a better bowl of wonton noodles. There may exist a better bowl somewhere out there in the universe, but I'd wager on this bowl of goodness to which many have tasted and testified. A definite win for Malaysian and Korean tourists
4
Been there a few times but it is only this visit that I brought my son (11yo) along. Personally I like Eng's wanton mee because their noodles have a nice texture and is yummy with their (very spicy) chili. I am glad that my son enjoyed it too and he even said 'this is one of the best wanton mee ever'. There is a public carpark just behind the stall hence convenient for drivers. Areas for improvement include expanding the selection of drinks and making the wantons a bit bigger!! Too small lah!
4
Eng's noodle has been around for more than 50 decades. This wonton noodle expert still preserves their traditional authentic taste of the early days. It tastes extraordinary good with their homemade chilli sauce that (for those of you who can't deal with spicy food) will burn your tongue and make you erupt in perspiration instantly.

The stall at Dunman previously tasted a lot better. Doesn't take anything like wanton me but more like just plain noodles with wanton and char siew. And to top it all up, service was just as abrupt. I guess that's the problem when you commercialise a traditional stall. The food standards obviously was not up to the usual par, service becomes non-existent because they are just paid workers. I wonder if the other Brother still operates in Dunman cause I'm never coming back to this place. Over priced and definitely no wow. Their sign boast of their supposed crispy fried lard but also not available.
5
The noodles are cooked to the right texture all the time and when accompanied by the fiery hot chilli, it is really satisfying. It's not the typical wanton noodles you'll get from most hawkers in Singapore. The noodle texture, chilli and clear accompanying sauce are quite unique. I prefer the boiled wanton to the fried ones as you can taste the pork and seasoning alot better.Be prepared to queue at times. Overall it's good enough for a monthly visit there for me.

Tonight we had a quick meal with my family at Eng's. Very tasty, freshly made wontons....boiled and deep fried. Drinks are served in nice jars.
5
Best wonton's I have had in Singapore. Really nice flavour of pork. Chilli is very spicy adding a nice kick. Dry noodle option is really good. Affordable and fast option.
4
Casual dining place along Tanjong Katong Road, which serves tasty, local style wanton noodles. The noodles have a springy "qq" texture, and you can up the spiciness level, depending on your preference. A good place to eat, if you are nearby the area.
5
Distinctly local take on wanton noodles. It's not like the Hong Kong style at all. A great lard flavour and noodle texture. The Chilli sauce is really very spicy. Add cautiously!
The fried wantons make a great side dish.
4
These wanton noodles do the trick. The Chilli sauce is extremely spicy! Add in moderation. I always order a side of crispy fried wantons. They are delicious! The normal wantons are also pretty tasty. The noodles and roast pork here are average.

Grew up with Dunman Food Center in my neighbourhood where we were spoilt for choices. Eng's always had a queue. It was good but it always puzzles me why bother queuing for the noodles. Now that it has moved to a standalone shop in Tanjong Katong, the price, too, have skyrocketed, possibly due to higher rentals. The value for money declined.....dramatically. I like Eng's but JUST discovered where they vacated at Dunman Food Center, there is another stall selling wanton noodles exactly like Eng's. For only S$3.00 and S$3.50

My family & I are frequent customers of Eng's, dating way back to the 1980's when the stall was at Dunman Road Hawker Centre upper level. The stall then closed for a period, then re-opened at the same hawker center, at the lower level. Then, they moved to the current shophouse in Tanjong Katong Road.For my family & I, this is clearly the best Wanton Noodle in Singapore in all these aspects:- Quality of noodles.- Just-right (al dente) cooking of the noodles to ensure noodle springiness.- Quality of the "char siew" pork slices.- Fiery chili sauce.- Delicately-done boiled wantons.- Tasty accompanying soup.Seldom do I find other Wanton Noodle stalls who get all these 6 elements humming in unison. Unlike other stalls, the Wanton Noodles here are not oily. Oily, soggy Wanton Noodles are a put-off no-no for me. It has just the right balance of oiliness.I rank Eng's as the top Wanton Noodle in Singapore. (Other Wanton Mee stalls I frequent from time to time are: (a) Both the "Fei Fei" stalls in Joo Chiat. These are overly oily. (b) Wanton Noodle stall previously in Eminent Plaza Hawker Centre (centre closed now). (c) Tanjong Rhu Hawker Centre Wanton Noodle (corner stall) - noodles not springy.)There is another Wanton Noodles very similar in style to Eng's. Quite indistinguishable. They originated from the family of Eng's, but, over time, there was the usual family split. This stall is in Dunman Road Hawker Centre, upper level. Its called Dunman Road Wanton Noodles. (This stall unit site was exactly where Eng's was in the 1980's when I first started eating at Eng's. This was before the family split.) This stall is very good too

They make customers wait despite having so many empty tables. Apparently it is their management's instruction not to seat small groups at bigger tables even if available. You are made to wait outside the shop until the table of exact size for the group is vacated. This is incomprehensible when customers need only 15 mins max to complete a meal of wonton noodles. They even put up "reserved" signs at the many tables rather let than waiting customers use those tables. Who on earth reserves tables to eat simple noodles at a stall?

Heard my office colleagues mentioned this "Ah Eng" wanton in katong a few month back and decided to explore and try out today after church. Its very popular and quiet crowded (we reached at around 130pm) and we got a table for 4 after a 15 minute wait, not too long. Order system is efficient and simple, just check the boxed on the order form and pay at the cashier,collect drinks and wait for noodles and sides to be served. The noodle is pale yellow - a bit like its original raw color but taste yummy when you sink your teeth in. The gravy permeates each strand well. There is char siew, some wantons and vegetables. We ordered additional boiled and fried wantons as sides. In addition to green chilli and chille sauce, they also provide deep fried pork lard cube bits as garnishing - super!No that I have tried both Ah Eng and Soi 19 wanton mee, my family asked how does this compare with the Soi 19 thai wanton mee in Ang Mo Kio, my answer to them was that both are equally good - but each is prepared and presented in a different way. I felt the queuing time for Soi 19 was just too long though...:

The best won ton noodles in the whole of Singapore! The Chilli is a killer even for those who love chilli. Personally I think the Char Siew can be more roasted to make it more flavourful,but the wontons are yummy. Hence I normally order the noodles with just the wonton
5
Excellent food. The home made chilli sauce should be sold on shops, it's amazing! I come here at least once a week. I've tried other places but Eng's is always the favourite! A must try!
1
I'll never pay a single cent for bad manners. This is one place. Owner was extremely rude and i definitely felt like i did them a favor by eating there. Thanks but never again.
5
Noodle nicely bouncing, wantan amazingly tasty, love its signature super spicy chilly sauce. Just good to blow my stress away with one bowl of dry noodle. Always my favourite local food!
4
Good food - perfect place for noodle and wantons lovers. Small selection, which makes it actually unique - thanks to this you don;t need 15 minutes to think of what you'll eat and you can be certain that everything will be fresh and good, as the restaurant specializes in this. The service is a bit unpleasant as they expect you to eat as quickly as you can and then leave the place, so I do not recommend it to the ones that want to spend some time on chatting etc. In general - great food, but poor service
5
The best wonton noodles if you like the noodles al dente, mixed with fiery Chilli sauce and deep fried pork fat. I have ordered a large portion and all the noodles can easily be separated, unlike others which might stick together Or become soggy. Be very very cautious about adding the Chili sauce and the warning on the Chilli sauce. This is by far the hottest Chilli I have tasted on any wonton noodles. It will leave you mouth hot and burning, your face perspiring and you want to have more of it and you can't because your mouth has become numb :)

Came by Eng's to have their wantan mee for lunch.Noodles were done exactly as how the patriarch did it when the stall was at Dunman Road Food Centre, although they are now cooked by kitchen helpers. You can help yourself to the container of pork lard for enhanced flavour to your noodles. There is a squeeze bottle of potent chilli sauce which will bring sweat to your brow almost immediately. The bottle comes complete with a label 'BEWARE of super HOT chilli'.Each bowl costs $4.50
4
This is a great place to try Malaysian-style wantan mee (noodles) without the traditional ketchup-y wet taste that normally goes with Singaporean-style noodles. It's an establishment that has passed through 3 or 4 generations and I highly recommend their dry noodles (dry means no soup) so that their house special chilli sauce sticks better to the noodles. You won't lose out if you order soup noodles - the same soup stock is served to you in a separate bowl.

The food was served and eaten faster than we had taken the time to drive there for dinner. Ordering is simple - fill in the pad at your table with your choices, go to the counter and pay, and the food is delivered to you literally within minutes. Noodles come in two sizes - $4.50 and $5.50.The noodles are not the typical HK style wonton noodles, but are rather thick and springy. It does not come with chilli but you can add some from the spicy bottle at your table. If you prefer to have cut slices of green chillies, you can get some from an end table at the back.The wontons are typically small but filled with flavour, and we especially like the deep fried ones, Prices for two people, including drinks amd vegetables, come up to around S$20
5
Went here for our first authentic cuisine and it was superb, a very simple and limited menu featuring noodles and wantons. You fill in your own menu chit and take it to the counter. The food arrived quickly and it was delicious, we had a clear soup, noodles with boiled wantons and a side of fried wantons. Open daily 11 am - 9 pm closed alternate Monday's (and they do have a sign showing which Monday's they are closed)

Your life is not complete until you have tried wanton mee (noodles) from Eng's. Only then will you have realised that all the Wanton Mee that you have eaten before is but a faint imitation of the master's.Granted, everyone has a preferred style that they probably grew up with. This is my favourite. The wanton themselves are freshly made and taste superior to all the frozen commercial dumplings that are served normally. The noodles are thick and chewy and are doused in a clear sauce that is deceptively tasty. Of course, this is then mixed with a spoonful of the Chili sauce. Please read the label, they really really mean it when they say that it is spicy.My dad and mum who grew up in the East Coast area have been eating his noodles since it was sold from a pushcart. Apparently they used to be a lot more generous with the pork lard in those days, so to up the old school ante don't hold back on the lard (served on condiment jars on the side, easy to miss)!

Eng Wantan Mee used to be one of Singapore favourite but after the son took over, standard has dropped tremendously.
Further , Prices are Too high and it's not worth to eat there anymore
4
I love the dry wanton noodles here. Quite reasonably priced and nice. Don't expect service to be good here and please be prepared to queue during peak hours.
2
What a bad experience. Approaching a packed place and asked for a place to start a queue , what I got was a very ignorant response.
Try not to come to this place anymore, not that the food are fantastic.
5
This little noodle shop is iconic. It has a long history by most importantly has great wonton noodle dry and wet and super cool dried wontons. We both are for about S$10. We arrived just before closing so no wait otherwise there is a short q. Moves pretty fast tho. Bring a big appetite and your own napkins. And enjoy
5
This is really off the beaten track and you need a local to direct you or that you hire a cab to bring you straight to its doorstep and to wait for you. It's neither near hotels or anything touristy in nature. But if you are resourceful, be sure to drop by. The noodles are homemade, so you won't find anything similar anywhere else, it's a bit oily but the best part is the chili sauce. There are warning labels on them so you can't sue them when you burnt your tongue on it

i grew up in joochiat and have had enough wantan mee to tell you, this is the best. when i was younger, i'd cringe at the thought of Eng's "Ultimate" chilli but that has never stopped me from going.. again and again. You would have heard enough rave about the infamous chilli, and i assure you that my decision to pen this review now (after being their loyal fan for 15yrs) is because aside from their chilli, noodles are good on their own, wantons are juicy and tasteful, charsiew (not the best, but good enough), down to their soup broth, they have mastered it all. Be prepared for long wait (well i stay nearby hence i'd go during off-peak hours) and manageable "chaos", for foodies driving over please park your vehicles at the public carpark behind their shop, there's road cameras in this zone. Address: 287 Tanjong Katong Road, Open daily: 11am to 9p

The best noodles and dumpligs ... hands down ... I have eaten in Singapore! The shop is small, tables are shared, the menu is limited ... noodles, wet or dry and dumplings, fried or steamed ... but the taste will blow you away! Paper thin sliced bbq pork over chewy al'dente style noodles fried in pork lard all hide succulent dumplings. If you are brave enough to use the chili sauce, i hear it packs quite the punch but cuts through the rich taste quite well ... I opted for the iced lime juice drink instead. And if you need more pork and texture, you can help yourself to the deep fried cracklings to sprinkle on top! Large bowl of noodles, small order of extra dumplings and drink ... $11.00. In Singapore, that is quite the bargain! I will be back

~Team decided to go Eng's in 2 cars, arrived 1145 without reservations, got the ig roundtable no waiting~Familiar with the system, pencil in Table 3 and scratched our 6Big 1Small Wanton Noodle (comes with Char Siew-bbq sliced pork & Veg) + a plate of Fried Wanton & drinks~No queue at this time, walked up to the counter, handed over the order slip, paid and in 3 mins, everything is served~My table took the entire communal container of "ba yu" (fried pork lard) which was completely drained of oil and spooned out a huge mountain of it on the Fried Wanton plate, this condiment is what locals love... try it once :)~Again take only what little you need of that chili bottle, it will bring tears to your eyes quick~We were out at about 1215 when the queue started to form outsid

The noodles were average and the BBQ pork lack taste. The wantons were full of MSG, so was the sauce of the noodles. The only thing good about this place is the spicy chilli, and I mean really flaming spicy. You have to drink lots of water after having it or you'll lose your voice for a week
5
Our entire table ordered the exact same dish: small dry noodle for $4.50. It was served very quickly. The noodle is cooked al dente, but a little under. The flavor and harmony of the entire dish is just perfect. The drink is a little sweet when we had the chestnut, but our favorite part of the meal was the condiment section:Chili sauce, fresh cut chilis and deep fried pork lard. All to your preference
