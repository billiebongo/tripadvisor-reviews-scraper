My family had dinner. Three of us ordered the gindara set while one ordered the sashimi set. The food was excellent and prices were reasonable. I had visited this outlet several times for lunch too. Good food, good service and good ambience.

Tomi sushi recently had 50% off their Unagi set. Was $48 before and $24 after discount. Unagi was thick and succulent! Super delicious and at a great price!

had a great time in this restaurant. Very good quality. The only food item which was not 100% too mi liking here is the Ikura (fish eggs) - but otherwise very good.

Tomi Sushi surprised me with its quality and selection of food. Location isn’t exactly where you would expect to find a good Japanese restaurant but there it is. Service is prompt although not always seems sincere and friendly. However, given the quality and the price of food, it’s worth visiting if you are in the area.

I always like to have my dinner at Tomi Sushi (Millenia Walk branch). The food and customer service was good. This was my first visit to Novena branch. I have recommended my friend to try out Novena outlet yesterday night 7 pm as it is near to his workplace. We have ordered 2 sets of dinner. I have changed my rice to sushi rice. My friend’s food came first. However, they mix up the order and put the sushi rice to my friend set dinner. They took it back and change it to white rice. When my order came, they told me it is a set dinner comes with sushi rice. I tried their rice, it is totally tasteless and I try my friend’s rice as well to confirm that I am right. It is still tasteless. I ask one of server to change it. However, they still insisted it is sushi rice without checking with the kitchen. The worst experience was that they just walked away without doing anything/telling me what they are going to solve it. I am not going to pay the white rice with sushi rice price. Therefore, I have asked another server to change my rice to sushi rice after 5 minutes of waiting. Then only she took my rice and checked with kitchen. Finally they have changed it to sushi rice. They never apologize for their poor customer service at all. The sushi rice was not good as Millenia Walk branch as they didn’t mix it well and tasteless.Obviously, their staffs were lack of training, have a poor customer service and can’t speak well in English.For their food wise, their food is average. Grilled fish and chawamushi was good. However, their sashimi was below average. It was not cold/fresh. This kind of food quality and service was not worth for the price we were paying.I will not visit this branch again. In my opinion, if you want visit tomi sushi, do go to the Milienia Walk branch

I tried Tomi four years ago and was happy with the food quality and service. I thought the chain originated in Japan did a better job than the locals such as Ichiban Boshi.Last night I went with my son who just started to appreciate Japanese food. The restaurant was almost deserted. And Was not impressed by the sashimi set. The freshness and quality of the fish was subpar. The sweet potato tempura was chewy. The price is also high given the quantity. It is a disappoint experience for us

I've always been a fan of Tomi Sushi but usually frequent the branch at Millenia Walk. This has always been my go-to place for authentic Japanese food where they serve up good well made sushi with flavors that remind me of Tokyo. This was my first visit to the branch at Novena and it does pale in comparison to their main branch at Millenia. When we walked in, at around 1.30pm, the lunch time crowd had mainly dispersed. The staff mainly spoke Mandarin there and were loudly gossiping about someone in plain view of the customers. We ordered the kaiseki set lunches and the food was not as spectacular over here. The quality of the chirashi don that I had was alright. The selection was rather poor in fact, almost resembling the more common local joints like Sushi Tei but there was a large, almost generous portion of rice sitting at the bottom.My dining partner had a set that was made up of tempura which fared better. The tempura was well done with the same light batter that we remembered from our last visit to Tomi Sushi. We forgot all about the sea salt that we were given on our previous visit though, which I much preferred as a tempura dip rather than the usual sauce. I personally didn't quite like this branch and would personally recommend that if you do need to visit, do go to the one at Milenia Walk instead

Would have ranked Tomi Sushi 'Very Good' were not for the extremely rude Vietnamese staff there, trust me, they are capable of ruining customers' day & tarnishing dining experience at such an authentic Japanese restaurant.Tomi Sushi Novena has been my family's favourite restaurant for years for their authentic Japanese cuisine and above average service-used-to-be. However, to our greatest horror, an outstandingly hostile staff named Victoria appeared in Tomi Sushi some 3 months ago, eg.: she glares at customers who come to Tomi Sushi, throws dishes on tables, points at customers with her finger..needless to say, her facial expression qualifies her as a loan shark or perhaps a warrior. To make things worse, our visit tonight (28 July 2017) there were 2 more Vietnamese female staff working in Tomi Sushi, same ' Victoria Style', even standing in front of tables, commanding customers to clear tables for them. Come on, this is S'pore, compulsory service charge (which is their salary) applies, they don't have any right to chase loyal customers from a popular Japanese restaurant away, well, on the hand, I would like to seek Tomi Sushi top management's attention on housekeeping for manpower. Other staff there are very friendly and welcoming, what's the point of keeping those Vietnamese staff to lose market share to Ichiban next door

Went there after seeing a number of reviews on their food. Food was great especially their Sushi! The rice they use are from Japan and it taste so different. Miso soup was of very high quality too. The quality of sushi here is really good. Very fresh! Will definitely return for more!
3
Was looking forward to eat at Tomi again since it left a great impression on me the first time. But I was left disappointed. For that price, I was expecting delicious food. Apart from the salmon sashimi and sushi, the other dishes were quite ordinary and portions were small. Service was slow and at one point, I could not even get the attention of any servers. Maybe dinner is a little different from lunch. I may return again to give it another chance and hopefully it will be much better
5
Tried their Una Jyu (eel) and Tokujyo Nigiri at Tomi sushi and it was very good. Their Japanese rice was excellent and tasted a little sweet on its own which is quite unique.
5
The food is delicious and of very good quality, though it may be a bit more pricey than other Japanese restaurants. Staff are friendly and approachable.
5
Had the lunch set which I think is value for money. Sashimi was fresh and and I really have no complains it was a very satisfying meal. Service fast and efficient.

I heard about the good review but their price is high especially dinner time. I went there for lunch and it is around average of $30 so quite good value. I enjoy dining there but the place I think have not complete the renovation. It looks quite simple. The meal are delicious and taste good. I did not take too much raw stuff but my friend said everything is good for her too
4
The sushi at Toni was pretty fresh and close to the options offered in Japan. I had the Nigiri Sakura set lunch which came with a 8 pieces of sushi, salad, miso soup, egg custard and fried chicken pieces.The set was pretty filling and quite substantial. The restaurant was quiet and relaxing as well. A good time to wind down for a Friday lunch

Was looking really hard for a jap restaurant in katong, finally read about tomi restaurant n fohnd it in the secluded building of katong v. Nobody served us at the door, and when we walked in, the chef had to point us to a seat. Ordered the sashimi set n soba set. Portions was not very generous though they looked pretty good on menu. Served sparsely to look like there is alot but in actual fact there isnt. Chawamushi was good, sashimi was not very fresh, sushi was average n dry. Soba was normal. Overall not very fulfilling, we spent 78++ for these 2 sets n left still a little hungry. Never going back again. Wasabi teh is stil the bes

Went with a male friend for dinner in January 2017. This restaurant will serve large portion of promotion bento sets for S$48 that can be shared by 2 persons if you have an average appetite.I ordered the Sashimi set from the regular menu at S$50 - consists of tempura, saba fish, sashimi, chawanmushi, sushi set, japanese pickles, miso soup, rice and a cut fruit.The seafood were very fresh and portion was rather huge even for a foodie like me. The only disappointment was that the sashimi slices were too thick for my liking.Service staff were swift and attentive. The restaurant is located at Velocity which is located above Novena MRT station.If you are looking for quality sushi and/or sashimi and is willing to pay slightly higher price than the usual 'fastfood' sushi chains, then you can consider this restaurant

After googling mid-range sushi options in Singapore, we visited this place. Ordered a 'Tomi Nigiri' sushi platter and sushi gozen set. Sushi came out within minutes of placing the order. It was obviously prepared before hand and the taste difference was telling. The rice was sticky and the fish wasn't fresh. Similarly the sea weed wasnt crisp as its supposed to be. Some pieces were good, but overall the range was average. I have had sushi/sashimi at a finer grade restaurant and for people who want to be wowed by the quality of sea food, this is not the place
5
Had lunch at Tomi Sushi and I am glad that this is one of the few places that has maintained its food quality and service standards in spite of its rather rapid expansion. Food portion is good and prices of lunch sets are reasonable! I also like it that they provide different Soyu for Sushi and Sashimi.

This review is specific to the Tomi Sushi Bar at Millennia Walk which is conveniently accessed via the Esplanade or Promenade MRT stations.This Sushi Bar & Restaurant is a good choice for business lunches, business dinners and personal lunches and dinners. I appreciate the choice of sitting at the Sushi Bar or in the restaurant, depending upon the number of guests with me.The sushi chefs are thoughtful and helpful if you sit at the Sushi Bar and regardless of what you order, you must begin your dining experience with the miso soup; probably one of the more flavorful miso soups in Singapore.The menus are simple, colorful and not complicated and I always notice the freshness of the various dishes I order during my visits.The complementary green tea is also of unique flavor do do not overlook the green tea.I try different sushi, sushimi and noodle dishes every time I visit.I also appreciate the convenience of this Tomi Sushi at Millennia Walk which has a quieter atmosphere conducive to good conversation with friends, colleagues and clients. Due to the recent renovation of the upper level of Millennia Walk, it is recommended to walk to the information counter and take the escalator behind the information counter to the upper level to access Tomi Sushi. Enjoy

Our son suggested this place and we tried this at the Velocity branch.
Quick service. Good food. Enjoyable meal in clean environment.

I've been to the original restaurant in Nigata Japan. This Sin restaurant also very nice the same way as the original.
It's not too expensive and they provide nice Sushi(s). This is a good Sushi-restaurant in Singapore.
4
Not just another sushi place. The food is fresh. Service is fast, the atmosphere is pleasant. We'll be back.

I had high expectation of this place after reading the reviews online. I treated my husband for his birthday. The items we wanted to order were not available even though it was labeled as such as with the other items. That kinda dampen our mood and expectation.We ended up ordering Megisu Fried ($15++), tempura moriawase ($18++), dragon roll ($22++) and a coke light ($3.20++). Our total bill came up to be about $70 and we feel as if we are nothing. I can't comment on the sashimi because we did not have that but it may be good for those who love those! If you want fried food items,Saboten is a better bet.

We visited Tomi Sushi for dinner yesterday , was not busy being a weekday night. Normally , the food is quite tasty and of high quality. However, I found the Tempura set that I ordered a little bland , and the watermelon given was not totally ripe. Anyway, yesterday could be one of those days for them , I will continue to visit them as they are one of the best Japanese outlets in Novena mall

My family have been frequent diners at Tomi Sushi Velocity outlet for the authentic Japanese food, there are several Japanese chefs there, thus food is prepared delicious and fresh.Service itself.. Huge contrast between the pleasant and rude staff. Special compliments to Ms Yen, who has always been polite and efficient. Same goes to a Japanese gentleman who has been working there for years, always extends Japanese hospitality to all the customers. Nevertheless, there is a staff named Linda who is extremely rude, it's really disappointing to see her presence in my favorite restaurant, she has ever taken away our plate while we just started eating, threw dishes on our table and walked off while shouting at her colleagues. Once I requested for warm water, she walked away and never came back. Well, it's strange that such an ill-mannered waitress is allowed to work there
3
We had lunch and service was prompt and friendly. It can get a little noisy during lunch, so Tomi Sushi might not be the best place for business lunches. On to the food, the sashimi and sushi are relatively fresh as compared to other restaurant chains. However, for the same price, I'd rather head over to Rakuichi at Oasis Hotel. The kurobuta nabe was a great disappointment; not only was the soup bland and tasted more like vegetable soup, the pork slices had this distinct musk of pork that's not cleansed properly. Perhaps I'm too sensitive. It's a good experience on the overall, though I might not go back again
4
Been here several times now. Service is good. Food is consistently great. The set service is a great option and includes more than enough food (tempura prawns, miso soup, sushi, teriyaki chicken, rice, salad). They have a small room in back for larger groups that works well for up to fifteen or so people. Definitely recommend this place for Japanese food.

I went to this place for late lunch yesterday.I ordered Chirashi Don set. The set came with sushi rice topped with 1 piece of Salmon Sashimi, 1 piece Ika, 2 pieces of tuna, salmon roe and all of the sashimi was very fresh and tasty. One piece of egg was insipid. Pickle ginger was quite nice. The sushi rice was sweet, sticky and tasty. Miso soup was quite little sweet from the salmon bone. No tofu or seaweed in it like other Japanese restaurant though. Chawanmushi was little too wet but the taste was good. Salad and Fruits was fresh. Green tea was a little weak on taste and aroma. The way Waitresses talked to customer just too rude. It Needed customer service training!

If you are looking for the best Sushi in Singapore search no further Tomi Sushi is the place. The sushi is perfect, great portions well priced, the chefs are friendly and take great pride in the presentation and the food. there passion is your meal. Don't miss this one

It's run by Japanese sushi chef and many Japanese eats here, a good sign for good authentic food. Indeed I was very happy to try this restaurant. Fresh fish and seafood, right amount vinegar in the sushi rice, good sake.

Tried it last night
Good food.. Good service..
The prices are reasonable
Would recommend it for sure

We were there on a Tuesday night and it was quiet. The crow started to come in at around 7pm. The serving crew was helpful, with recommendations on how we should order to try their specialities. The food was great. The fish was fresh and nicely prepared. We find the price a little steep but it was justified with the quality of food we had
5
We visited Tomi Sushi twice on our recent visit to Singapore. We had the excellent value $35 SGD pp. Chicken Teriyaki set which consisted of salmon sashimi, prawn and vegetable tempura , ramen soup, four pieces of sushi and fruit. All food was of the highest quality. It was so good the first time we had exactly the same the second time we visited. The Sake list is extensive and has a good selection of premium and super-premium sakes from the well known Niigata area. We especially enjoyed the Kubota dry sake and thought it was a reasonable price. Staff are friendly and a special thanks to Olivia for her good service
5
The lunch set was good value for money. We ordered nigiri sushi and salmon don set. The raw items were fresh and tasted good but the chicken karaage was a bit too salty. Other than that, it was a satisfying meal. We also like how the waitress kept refilling our green tea without being prompted. Next visit I will try their tempura.

A local friend highly recommended this place, as they are famous for their quality of sushi. The place is located on the 2nd floor of the shopping mall connected to the MRT station (Novena). The place has nothing special about from outside (and inside) - a few posters of Japan and quite uninteresting furniture. The plastic menu laid on the table also looked dodgy, really did not impress me. However the food was delicious, sushi, sashimi and soba were amazing. All in all - come here for great food, but don't expect any authentic atmosphere or setting
4
The entrance and the decor of this place is very simple and as such, it doesn't give you much confidence that its going to give your palate a treat, but it does. We had the lunch menu and tried the Nigiri Sakura, Salmon Teriyaki Lunch and the Gin Teri Lunch, and everything was done with finesse, the food was fresh, the tastes were fantastic. Service was good with green tea served the moment we set down and there was very minimal waiting time for our food. The menu offers some seasonal exotic items, which we would love to try the next time we are there.Don't let the simple, clean look of this place fool you - it deserves a try and you won't be disappointed

Tomi Sushi has come a long way from its first outlet in Japan back in 1954. Today, it has expanded to 14 outlets in Japan, and has penetrated the Singapore market as well. Currently there are 3 outlets here, being Cuppage, Novena and Katong - we visited the branch in Novena.We started off with the Ankimo (SGD$15.00) - the Anglerfish Liver. It was soft and creamy, the texture reminding me of foie gras; but the flavor made me think of cod liver oil - a little fishy, savoury, yet piquant in its deliciousness. They serve this item in different ways - you can choose to have it as an appetiser like we did, or the sushi version at SGD$10.00.Then we tried the Madara Shirako Ponzu appetiser (SGD$20.00) - Pacific Cod Soft Roe. It looks coiled like intestines, but it is so brittle it melts in the mouth into a mouthful of lusciousness. It was so smooth in texture I felt I could simply slurp it up with a large straw. The flavor was not unlike cod flesh - buttery, and much, much softer. This dish also comes in several versions - the appetiser version, the sushi version at SGD$16.00, the tempura version at SGD$20.00 or the chawanmushi version at SGD$12.00.Now came the mains. They served the Sashimi Set (SGD$35.00) first. This set consists of the pickled vegetables, a miso soup, a chawanmushi, fruits, and of course the precious platter of assorted sashimi (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, swordfish and shrimps) with rice. Yes, for that price, we get so many items, and the thickly-sliced sashimi were fresh, bouncy as well as tasty.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/03/dinner-at-tomi-sushi.htm

Passed by this restaurant in Velocity at Novena several times. Only decided to pay a visit after watching an insightful documentary of Tomi Sushi on NHK, how they run their business, train their staff as well as expansion overseas.As my family loves Japanese food and a fan of Sushi/sashimi, we have high expectations of this restaurant. Service was excellent, prompt and polite.We tried the maguro promotion that was on and was not disappointed. We also ordered seasonal shellfish
4
The very clean and simple layout, well lit restaurant had a calm and cheerful feel and I immediately felt happy settling at a table for my rather early dinner.I was very pleased with the food - fresh and authentic, like the fare served in Japan. (The only mismatch was the serving staff's service/quality level).Still, Tomi Sushi was a rare find in a shopping mall.
