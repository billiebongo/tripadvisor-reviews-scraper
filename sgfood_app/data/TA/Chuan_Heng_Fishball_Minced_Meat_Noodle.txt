Don't be deceived by the stall name. Although it says "mince pork noodle" but actually they also sell lor mee, laksa and stew beef noodles! Surprisingly, they are really jack of all trades and master of ALL! Most food stall holders are good at one or two dishes but hard to find one that are practically good at everything they cooked. I think the stall is manned by a couple who are both friendly and humble. It's our family favorite stall in this hawker center. We visited at least once a month to have our craving fixed. Our favorites are definitely the lor mee and stew beef noodles.

Other than their minced meat noodles which taste way better than a better known neighbouring stall in the same food centre, their lor mee is very much deserving of more attention too. With a thick yet not too starchy gravy to go with the very well cooked braised meat and egg, the overall taste of the noodles is further enhanced with the addition of their homemade crispy ngoh hiang, which I find a great alternative to the usual deep fried fish. I am a fan
