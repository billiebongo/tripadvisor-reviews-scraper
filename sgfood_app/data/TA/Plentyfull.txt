The waiter was very friendly and helpful. We had an enjoyable relaxing time without having any pressure to need to vacate the seats. Love the Grilled Stack Potato.

Very nice dinning ambience as the restaurant was bright and spacious. Food was interesting with a fusion type mix of western and Asian dishes. Whilst tasty, I found it over priced. Coffee was decent and the cakes delicious.

Loving the food and ambience of the restaurant. Their service staff were friendly and approachable :)

I’ve been to plentyfull a couple of times and the food has never disappointed. It’s a little on the pricey side but worth it with the entertainer app. Would give 5 stars if not for the service level. The staff were very professional but there seemed to be a shortage with only one man working the floor. Would highly recommend the short rib, meatball spaghetti and avocado toast. Would give the desserts a miss.

I’ve been dining at this place since it’s opening more than a year ago. It’s very difficult to recommend dishes here as the menu changes regularly. This is a great move as it gives a freshness to the offerings every so often. Chef Victor takes pride in his creating wholesome food with a blend of Asian flavours using what we recognise as western type foods. For example plum salted tomatoes, haloumi & avocado. Another dish I like as a starter is the tempeh and tofu fries. It combines the very Asian food tempeh and tofu, fried French fries style and paired with Asian sauces of sweet sauce, sambal and Thai Chili Jam is you prefer. Food is wholesome, interesting and innovative. I sometimes wish serving sizes were bigger. Plentyfull carries a very good selection of wines. Their bar also features interesting cocktails. Check out their board for specials which may surprise you. Plentyfull is also a great place for events. The host is initiated and attentive. I have held two birthday parties there, one for my fiancé and another for my mom. My guests were all extremely happy with the experience. Before the event, we had spent time discussing with the host on menu selection, choice of flavour and design of cake, guests requirement etc. It was a pleasant consultative experience which led to a wonderful time of celebration. How could I not mention cake and desserts?! The dessert team is outstanding. Aside from their daily offerings of delectable desserts from the devils chocolate cake to queens cake to their macaron, tarts and special offerings, the team had been able to customise the cakes I wanted. They excelled both in taste and design. This is a restaurant I enjoy and recommend. Although I hope their prices could fail slightly by say another 15% or so, the food and service is extremely joyful to experience.

The design in itself is truly well done and allows a comfortable experience. Food is freshly prepared and served and of high quality with Chefs interacting too. The concept reminds us a bit of California and the strong focus on product which is great to see here in Singapore. Defenite recommen

I was there with 4 friends on a Friday evening. I was impressed with the restaurant's deco and ambience but the inattentive staff were disappointing, especially the manager. There were 4 crew serving the floor but with at least 2 or 3 crowding around the counter top, either tending to 1 guest, with their back facing the floor, it's hard to get their attention. The food was served rather slowly. Dishes ordered took a while. The Plank of Plentyfull was not plentyful. The portions served could only serve at most 3 not-very-hungry people. The fries was done interestingly and we liked the texture of the potato layered against each other before it was fried. There is nothing special about the tofu and tempeh. We also tried the pasta which we all agreed had a wierd taste to it but the barramundi met our expectations. Desserts were creme bulee, which was delish, soft and sweet, and souffle, which was awkward because it seemed uncooked, appearing with an inflated top but full of froth and cream within, rather than a soft bubbly cake. There were hits and misses for the food but the staff could really work on being more attentive. It would also be great if the food were served in a more timely manner. Overall, I feel the pricing is mid high for this place but the food were overpriced, if I were to match the price to the taste of the dishes served.

My husband and I came here for dinner this week and really enjoyed our meal. The housemade flatbread was wonderfully chewy with a crispy exterior, and I loved the elderflower caramel and olive oil dip that came with it. We shared the spiced lamb ribs for our started and this was fantastic. The ribs were tender with just the right amount of fat, they fell off the bone as we picked them up, and the edamame and yogurt sauce were the perfect accompaniments. For a main I had the pumpkin gnocchi. I love gnocchi, and this was a particularly good rendition. They were pillowy and soft with a crispy exterior from being panfried, and the butter sauce was really flavourful and well seasoned. The salted caramel cheesecakes we had for dessert were super tasty too. The service was very friendly and warm. We were seated in a nice private booth in a quiet area of the restaurant, and while this was great it also meant we were a bit hidden from view, so had to flag someone over to take our orders or refill our water glasses, because it was easy to overlook us! Overall though the service was good the food was simple, tasty fare, well prepared and satisfying. We had a look at their brunch menu when we were there and it looks fantastic as well, we're already planning a return visit
5
Brunch here in general is above average. Love the bread that comes with the scrambled eggs. Will definitely come here again. One tip is that perhaps the coffee could come with coffee art. Otherwise, coffee is great too
3
Food - good , fresh and quite delicious.Service - slow , slightly reluctant. We spent more time waiting for service than actually eating the food.Definitely avoid Sundays
4
Was quiet when i visited on a wed night. Requested for a quiet area and were given as requested. Service was warm with recommendations n sharing of promotions. Foo was great though expensive for the price.
3
The food was very healthy and good portions, but taste wise not fantastic. The food was too healthy and raw for my liking so may visit again!
5
Great restaurant ambience! Food served were great too, unique flavors and food choices. Will visit again!

Came here with my date looking for good food and ambience and got above what we expected. Service staff was exceptionally good and very warm and polite. Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and explained food in a way that showed he took pride in the food served. Ambience and decor was lovely. Spacious and with enough wide open spaces between tables without feeling claustrophobic. Background music was lively without sounding rowdy or too loud. Food was fusion cuisine and excellently prepared and seasoned. Food cafe quite fast and was made of high quality fresh ingredients. Portion could have been bigger, but pricing was reasonable enough for quality versus portion served. Overall had a good time and 10/10 would come again.
4
Come here for dinner instead. The menu is more extensive and creative.Brunch has a limited menu and cooking was only above average
5
Great food and Great service!Food was really masterpiece. Staffs doing really well on the service. Overall excellent! Especially the food are the highlight of the night. Good job!
5
Service was excellent and food was great - we had the Duck confit, a chicken dish, and barramundi. All were cook very well, not dry, and skin kept crispy for the fish. For dessert we went for the Queen(s?) Cake. It was a little dry, but since it had layers of cream, that made up for some 'moistness'. It definitely is on the pricier end though

I have made reservation weeks back for 14~18 pax for a birthday celebration lunch. Menu was not sent until a few days prior the lunch. To make things easier for them, we have revert with our orders for the individuals. A night before the lunch, they revert that most of the dishes could not be served and required us to change most of our orders. This is a nightmare for me to organize a huge group lunch with them. Food is not bad but served cold. Disappointed!
3
The lamb rib was good . Pork Jowl was bit too soft and sweet . Beef Ragu pasta too beefy . Service was good overall . However , not sure if I will be back 
3
Apart from the hiccup of my reservation which I feel the fault lies entirely with the restaurant's reservation team, the food werent up to par for the prices they charge. Portion was too small and some items were not available or subsituted. Overall the experience was a letdown and I wont be coming back
4
I've been wanting to try this place and was pleasantly surprised with the place, ambience, food and service.
4
The price is at the higher side as compared to the quality and portion. However it's a place that provides clean and healthy food still
3
Nice place to chill out on a Sunday. Food is nice but average service. Not enough staff to walk around and ensure food service Order the creme brûlée French toast and is nice
4
I loved my all day breakfast set. It is quite a staple at restaurants serving western food but the version here is one of the best you can find in town as everything tastes so fresh and the sausage is uniquely done. The onsen egg here is always a treat as well. The cake which my friends ordered were a little hard and didn't look too appetizing though
4
My group and I had a wonderful time at Plentiful. The food was tasty and the presentation was artfully pieced together. Service was good too. Only minus point is that portions were a little small otherwise would have been better
3
Came here for lunch today and opted for one of the lunch sets, consisting of some rice with beef goulash and some sides all on the same plate. The food quantity was about right and I didn't feel hungry during the afternoon. We arrived around 12pm so there wasn't a queue, but I noticed quite a few people lining up as we left (around 12:45 or so). Staff were friendly and helpful and there were plenty of seats
1
Needed milk for my daughter one evening around 7:45pm and Plentyfull has shelves of it. Strangely though I was told the shelves of milk where 'managed' by a different company that closed at 7pm.Mel, a staff at the restaurant agreed to collect my cash and ring the till the following day so that my daughter could have her milk. Thanks, Mel. Much appreciated Jeff, a senior staff showed up moments later and berated Mel for assisting me .When I told Jeff not to give Mel a hard time, the former told me that he was 'speaking to Mel, not me!'If service is part of what Plentyfull offers, then Jeff's treatment of Mel is clearly uncalled for.If you're reading this, Management of Plentyfull...I'd have Mel and Jeff swap positions as soon as possible. Perhaps business will be better.Thanks again, Mel....keep it up! You'll go far.

Service provided was excellent. Staff was proactive and attentive. She brought me a glass of water after I told her I would like my coffee to be served now but hold the food till my friends arrive. She prepared side plates after I ordered side dishes to get started. Another staff noticed my friends have babies with them and asked if we would like baby chairs. Food is awesome and presentation looks appetizing. We love the ambience and how spacious the restaurant is. There were many families with children but it wasn't noisy because of the layout of the restaurant. This is the best restaurant for families with babies who need a quiet place.
3
Feel healthy when you dine. Feel free when you chat.Feel spacious when you sit.Brighten up your taste bud.But absence of warmth and friendly staf
4
Plentyfull has a very spacious and cosy ambience. It is designed and decorated to make every diner feel at ease and comfortable. I like it the fact that they farmed their own grocer and used it in their kitchen.
4
Good ambiance. Good place to hang out with friends as the place is quite big. Food is not too bad, but not very value for money.
5
Great place for a drink after work and try some different original beers and ciders! Service is friendly and they can tailor to your preferences. Loved it! Happy hour is a good deal
4
Ambience was really good, though it was almost 30 bucks for a main. Otherwise, service and everything else was fine.
5
We came for dessert after dinner and it was simply wonderful. Staff was helpful and made us feel very welcome and homey, too bad we didnt come for dinner, but we will definitely come back!
4
really yummy food and all the healthy stuff. This is a definite favourite and will be back for sure!!

I have been to this restaurant several times over the course of 9 months and I have to say the food consistency of this place is amazing. The food quality and the produce they used are excellent. Everything from their bread and sauces is all made from scratch. If you are looking for a relax and chill out place alternative to CMCR this is a great place to visit during the weekends with family and friends. The good part is they are open during the evening too. They offered a different dinner menu from their lunch. Reason being the cooks in the kitchen are given chance to put in their own creation on the weekly special menu. I was lucky to be able to have a chance to talk to the Chef Victor during the evening time while having dinner there with my friends while he was doing his round checking on tables and asking the guest for feedback and talking to his regular guest. Thank you for your time Chef. They have very nice outdoor sitting area too for chilling out during the evening time for drinks. Worth a visit

Had their Plentyfull fries & we were a bit disappointed by the small portion. Their 5 spiced duck leg confit was very good, we will go back to eat this again next time! Glazed acorn fed pork jowl was a bit plain tasting but the pork jowl was really tender. Disappointed by their Coconut creme brulee, it seemed to be more of a pandan flavor than coconut. Overall, this place served pretty nice food tho the price is a bit on the high side
4
The ambience is warm and cosy. It is a nice place for brunch but it can get a little too noisy for my liking.
4
This cafe has a great romantic vibe, love the decor and service as well. The recommended barramundi was however short of expectation and the pork jowl was not as magical as Dehesa's, though more affordable. The flat white was nice and the chai latte was of the more tea leaves-based and spicier with less latte/milk component
4
Everything was pleasant, from the ambience, friendly, thoughtful and helpful service, good food. Would be nice to hang out with friends. Shall be back again to try out the lunch sets
4
The chicken was tender, fish was done right and pork jowl was good. All hits for this place.. tofu chips was a good switch from the usual fries. According to my friends, the blanchan chili accompabying the tofu fries is super good. Worth trying!
4
Very fresh, great options, healthy in a nice ambiance (despite location within a mall)-- good value too
5
Must admit that it was quite a pleasantly sweet dining experience here, especially on a weekend afternoon. The cakes are surprisingly good and tasty, while the drinks interesting. Portions are rather generous and the ambience is great for casual lazing around. Will visit again!
5
Extremely nice ambience, great coffee and cakes. Good place to hang out with friends to chat and just enjoy the weekend :)
4
Mains were nice but dessert was enjoyable! Worth the visit just for their cakes. Menu selection limited though for their savory food. Service was very prompt and diligence though.
5
Pretty full at plentyfull. Eating clean can be so yummy too! 1 for 1 house pour wine was delectable. Left my phone there and the honest staffs kept it for me until I returned, very grateful!

Our first visit to this place. Environment is bright and spacious with greenery all around. One let down was that the toast for the ham sandwich was burnt, and it was served. The manager noticed it, came over and offered to have it changed. Kudos to him. We tried also the egg and mushroom sandwich, cheese omelette and stack pancakes. Generally the food is passable. They do sell interesting juices though.
4
Great food and i like the they sourced the produce from good ethical growers and suppliers. The food was presented well and taste great a plus for their generous portions. A good place to have brunch if you are in the are
1
It's Sunday and there were countable number of tables that were having brunch with many available tables. There were seats with high chairs and proper seats with table. We were waited to be seated with offering high chairs which we informed of not taking high chair seats but proper chairs with table. The waiter could not make decision and had to ask the manager who was busy making coffee by pointing the waiter to look at the reservation book. The point was we were there at 1:30pm with could possibly seat us at proper seats. There was no sense of welcoming hence we walked away
4
We just happened to eat here. We were passing by and saw the place and just decided to give it a try. It's basically a western and Asian fusion restaurant. The ambience is good,very cozy. We ordered the platter and I must say the meat was really cooked well. It tasted great and the sauces that came along also was good. The only disappointment was that there were no sides with the platter. I think for the Price they charge some sides must come with the platter. Overall it's good. A lot of desserts to choose from. The restaurant is a bit overpriced
3
The Valentine's set meal was good but the beef we ordered from the a la carte order was disappointing.
5
Right choice for the Valentine set course.
Enjoying the foods and the only matter is very slow in serving each courses. Anyway, quality of foods and services are there.
5
Fantastic creations that are not only pretty but taste like a small piece of heaven. First time I waited 3 1/2 hours for the full course to finish but felt it was worth the wait!
5
Laid back vibe with indie country tunes (makes you so relaxed), smiley staff, delish set meals that you pick off the counter. They even have a retail corner selling fresh fruits and healthy stuff..I'll be back!
5
It has spacious and cozy environment for friends gathering at accessible location. The staff is very attentive and cheerful to serve you. Thumbs up also for the food recommendation which is a unique fusion cuisine.
4
Love the concept and ambience of this new restaurant! Service was excellent especially Edwin who was attentive & ever so obliging. Food was better than expected & the menu is very vegetarian friendly.
4
It is in Millenia Walk. The restaurant is decorated with Garden theme. Cozy. Unfortunately, ventilation needs to be improved. Food was good. We had chicken porridge, burger and mushroom sandwich on Sourdough. All are good
4
In Millenia walk this cafe is a good place to relax.
With set lunches, brewed coffee and cakes you can enjoy whatever you want to eat.
You can browse or purchase produce that you need from fruits to cereals to chocs.
5
Great spot for lunch.
Very fresh food and good healthy as well as vegetarian and non vegetarian options.
Great service
Good overall value for money if you are looking for a proper lunch

This was a Sunday lunch in what is now quite a good selection of eateries in Millenia Walk. We picked Plentyfull as the fit out was cool, modern and open it was also less busy than kith. We now know why. When we entered staff were rude and took some time to get allocated the empty table we wanted. 3 of us ordered the Carbonara as looked good - unfortunately this meant tripling down on the worst Carbonara and worst pasta I have ever eaten. This was accompanied by some very greasy chips and bread that had been drowned in Olive oil and then burnt.Awful in every way possible please avoid as every other place in the mall is actually really nice.
