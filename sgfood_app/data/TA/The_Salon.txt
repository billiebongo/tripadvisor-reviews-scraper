They have a great chef behind those walls!

My wife and I celebrated our 23rd anniversary with a staycation at Hotel Fort Canning. We saw that dinner at The Salon was a four course Executive set. Service was fantastic by Ms Latty Gao. They did not have the Lamb shank and Latty proposed the Beef tenderloin instead. What a gastronomic delights! Soft and tender, the steak came in 2 thick chucks. Really melt in your mouth tender and juicy to nth degree! We are so coming back... Hope they run out of lamb shank again the next visit

The set lunch was good and value for money! I ordered Lamb Shank and my wife ordered Chicken. Both were tender, especially the lamb shank was juicy and delicious! However that day there was a Birthday function in the restaurant and it was full, so they seated us at the bar table out the restaurant. There were two waiters there, one is busy answering phone call and counting money in the cashier, while the other was busy with cutting fruits. We asked for warm water when we were seated but had to called and reminded them again after like over 10 - 15 minutes before we could have our water. The set back was on the service, and their service needs some improvement

Food and drinks were very tasty. When we ate dinner, there was only one other couple in the dining room. The waiter still managed to miss our appetiser (despite asking us flavour choices for it) which was a little frustrating. They also seated a family with a grumpy toddler immediately adjacent to us when there was an entire empty restaurant!

The restaurant was not very big, but it had a decent crowd for a Sunday afternoon. We were offered booth seats with a view of the extensive wine cellar. The table was huge and there was no danger in running out of space to place the dishes.The menu was a mix of Asian and Western dishes. The dishes were beautifully plated and the white of the crockery made the food and its colours stand out. Lunch started with 4 pieces of fish bites, coated thinly with batter (not oily) and the main dish was a thin-crusted pizza with 4 types of cheese (delicious). Dessert was the lava cake (wonderfully not too sweet).Service-wise, the orders should have been repeated after they were taken to ensure nothing was left out (in fact, one item was) and there was some confusion as to what glassware should be used for warm water (cup or glass?). Anyway, it was a small matter as the food speaks for itself; but certainly something that could be looked into.

My family decided to try The Salon after our visit to Fort Canning since it was getting late.We saw that there was a 4 course dinner set menu for S$30++ that consists of a Yuzu Salad, Pumpkin soup, choice of main course and choice of dessert. The ala-carte menu has a pretty decent selection and mix of local and western cuisines.My mum, who rarely likes western dishes, was pleasantly surprised by the taste of the main course which was a fusion spaghetti with grilled vegetables; and she chose the lava cake for dessert. She had no complains and finished every course, and the lava cake was heavenly.My dad had the tenderloin steak which was cooked as per his preference, medium. The sauce that comes with the steak was rich and goes very well with the steak.I had the wagyu burger, which was decent, not spectacular.The Salon does serve local fare too, but the price line is steep for these.I would recommend The Salon to others for the Set Lunch/Set Dinner, for the quality you get, it is in deed value for money

But the rest was pretty rubbish and way over priced. Plus I threw up all night, but possibly a bug unassociated with food. Maybe it was the food.
Definitely better options in walking distance if staying in the hotel

Atmosphere is cozy and relaxed. Service staff are youthful, attentive, polite and friendly. Though occasionally unfocused, given time and experience, they will mature into a team that can provide a consistent customer experience.

We had the 3 course meal for dinner, which the presentation of every dish was done very tastefully and of course exceeded our expectations in the taste department. We also tried the ala-carte dishes like the Laksa Spaghetti, while many might feel that it's a little more expensive compared to a typical laksa, we found it to be well worth the price. Service is very attentive and prompt. During our stay at the hotel we also enjoyed the breakfast served by The Salon. My only gripe would be that they should change their breakfast menu every alternate day for guests staying longer

Came here for breakfast after our wedding night, here's what we think:Ambience: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Customer Service: 5/5Quality of Food: 4/5Value for Money: 3.5/5Our OrdersInternational Buffet: 4/5Egg Benedict: 3.5/4Roti Prata: 4.5/5The Good: Sweet quiet morning, Service is excellent, it's good for a quiet morning chillax without anyone disturbing. Come here when it's not so crowded for the added Zen feel. The Bad: We quite love it, it's fine, just that it's nice, and it needs that extra spark.The Bottom Line: We will come back here again when it's not so crowded, recommend for foodies to come here and try, and for those looking for a quiet hideaway to come!

This was the most disappointing high tea I've had in Singapore - and I've had a few. Just a snippet of the lowlights I experienced:- A reservation for 3pm was pushed back to 3.20pm by the restaurant as the venue was being used for a wedding. Normally this wouldn't bother me, was it not for the fact that it was not communicated to me and I had to repeatedly ask when we could be seated.- The high "tea" with prosecco does not include tea. A first in my life that I reserve for a high tea and have to pay extra for the tea. - When the bites were served and I asked for an explanation of what was being served, the waiter was very surprised by my request. - I say "bites", because it was the least amount of food I've ever had served during a high tea seating of this price range. - Staff members were loudly carrying childrens toys (baby slides, etc) through the restaurant to something they were setting up outside. Distracting, unsightly and unprofessional.- The service was not at all what I would expect from a restaurant/ hotel of this calibre and I will not be returning.The only positive of this high tea was that the bites that were served were quite tasty.

I had a nice lunch and several breakfasts here during my stay at the hotel. Very nice food either for lunch (pics attached) or during the buffet breakfast in the morning from 7-10.30am. The buffet breakfast is always satisfying even though the spread is not as lavish as other hotels. I like the way they served the foods for the breakfast spread, right amount, fresh and of good quality

Fish and chips is simple but the batter was done perfectly . I will be back even if I'm not a guest here. The wasabi prawn can be a little bit less sweet to bring out the flavourable wasabi but I understand some guest may not prefer it . The pizza , fungi Parma ham was superb . Really Italian style . Simple and not overpowering tomato sauce . Great pizza . For a restaurant standard , it has way surpassed many myth that hotel food is ridiculous and overcharged. I beg to differ , especially this restaurant in Hotel Fort Canning. Definitely in my come back list . One last comment ,the house red and white was just fabulous . .,...., remember it is just house wine but the quality .,,, welll its Chilean ... I believe you know what Chilean wine stands for .

My wife and I ate lunch here while waiting to join a tour of the close-by Battlebox. The hotel building in which the restaurant is located, a local museum and the Battlebox are all pre-WWII British army constructions. The Salon is in the Hotel Fort Canning which is the latest life form of the historic building which has seen many uses over its life, including occupation by the Japanese army upon the fall of Singapore. The kitchen did an outstanding job of selecting the ingredients, and then preparing and plating the food. Both the Angus Burger and the Spaghetti Carbonara were outstanding dishes. The wait staff did an abysmal job of serving them and fell over themselves in number (we were served by four people) without meeting any acceptable service standard. I asked for a Gibson and the staff insisted that they would serve a Martini, but they had no green olives and would sliced black olives be acceptable!! We asked the second wait staff member to be sure to bring mustard with the food. She walked away and never returned. We asked the third wait staff member to bring mustard and also to replace the shaker bottle of dried-out Parmesan cheese. The mustard and cheese arrived just as we had finished those courses. It is hard to understand how F&B management that achieves so much in the kitchen can achieve so little front of house! It is hard to understand how property management and ownership can demand so little of F&B management when so much effort and money has been so successfully invested in opening the hotel

We stayed at HFC for 8 days and had a few meals at The Salon, including breakfast.The food is great, especially the local dishes - the HFC Signature Mee Goreng is particularly delicious. The Spaghetti Al Pomodoro and the Mezze Maniche All' Amatriciana are great Italian alternatives.The service can be a bit slow at times, but the staff are very friendly and always eager to help

I frequent this place quite a bit as I am a member of the fort canning club. Hence I would dine here casually after a day of gyming in the club or a dining appointment with colleagues and friends. Ambience 8/10Very cosy yet sufficiently professional look. No embarrassment at all to bring clients or colleagues to dine here. Food 7/10They have shrunk their variety. Right now, my favourite would be their mee siam lobster and it's chocolate fondue. It's curry chicken is well done too.Value 5/10Let's face it, $15 of mee goreng and $24 of mee siam... it's very expensive for its local food.Service 8/10A special shout out to Grace!! Very warm lady who loves to engage her customers. Shares her comments on food choices honestly. Thanks for making my regular dining experience a good one
