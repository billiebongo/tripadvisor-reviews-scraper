The food is definitely authentic and local, but some queue is really long. Difficult to find a seat.
5
I've been to 3 hawker centres in Singapore. By Far this is the best.
Great selection of soup based noodle or fried dishes and to finish off with cool refreshing drinks and deserts.
5
Love the prawn noodles, chicken wings and soursop juice. A must to order every time when I go thereðŸ˜‹
5
This is my favorite local hawker food center, 1 stop shop for all your needs. The variety and standard of food is just awesome. Great place to have friends from overseas to try truly local tastes. My returning SINGAPORE friendsâ€™ favorite!
5
Great place, cheap eats, exceedingly good food. The food is fantastic all around, so I'd recommend you try to visit as many stalls as you can :). I can highly recommend e.g. Tong Kee BBQ Chicken Wings, run by the same guys for over 20 years
5
I don't normally review hawker stalls but this stall is a gem. Run by 2 Thai sisters the food is fantastic. I have been there twice now and the Thai salad is great but the basil beef rice is amazing, tasty and soft beef. This stall is well worth finding.
5
Make this a must-do on your list while in Singapore! Itâ€™s a foodie heaven. If possible, go with a few people so you can order an assortment of local dishes to try. You wonâ€™t be disappointed. We had char kway tiao (fried noodles), oyster omelette, rojak (local salad), poh piah (fresh spring roll) and satay (skewered bbq meat). Wish we had room for more..
4
This is one of my favorite local hawker center in Singapore.It offer majority local Chinese food, plus some western and Malay food.But not all are 100% good, but probably 70-80% are in good cook and worth exploring.You must chose the right one for the similar food, usually good one are with crowd, so take a looks surround what put on the eater table, popular one always the good one.So just explore and you will enjoy the good taste with new experience
4
My all-time favorite place to go for comfort food at night! Also a great place to bring your foreigner friends visiting Singapore because they can have first hand experience of the hawker environment and all the yummy food in one place!Hokkien Mee - I usually go to Yi Ji Fried Hokkien Mee (Stall#102), by the time I get there, Nam Sing is usually sold out or closed already.Chicken chop or anything western - Western Barbeque (Stall#53)Banana Fritters - Geylang Lor 20 Banana Fritters (Stall#57) Tip: go early or they will sell out. and eat it piping fresh and hot...There are still tons of other options but I have been very conservative whenever I visit this place
3
Visited on Tue, 26 Dec. Probably the long queue at loh mee stall kept my expectation high up in the sky. It didnâ€™t give me that wow factor when I tasted it and in fact I had better loh mee in Melbourne. Fried Kueh Teow and chicken rice are not bad. A few other highly rated stalls were closed during lunch hours. Ordered a large glass of sugar cane and it was so huge that it can last for the whole day
5
The hawker food centre had lots of variety to choose from.The food was delicious,cheap too.The cleaness was alright.The service was nice.The place was near a mall as well.So I will give the food centre 4 and a half stars out of 5.
5
always have plenty to eat at this hawker centre; the variety is mind boggling and standard across most stalls is very good. Cheap prices as well!
4
I really enjoyed this hawker centre! The location was very convenient, about 5 minutes on foot from MRT Lorong Chuan. Food was delicious, cheap with so many options to choose. Service was good and friendly. Love it!
5
This hawker center has one of the best selections of local delights in Singapore and prices are reasonable too. From fried kuay teow to Hokkien Mee, Rojak, Nasi Lemak, Fish Head noodles, satay and BBQ chicken wings, Lor Mee you can easily get these and the quality of food is really good!
4
Very happy to see that there are more young 2nd/3rd generation hawkers who are taking over or helping out their aged hawker parents.The fried kway teow was excellent, closest thing to a Penang char kway teow you cam get in Singapore.The old Hock Lam Beef Noodle has also moved here, look for Francis for a satisfying bowl
4
If youâ€™re a Backpacker in Singapore this is a great place to eat and keep it cheap! We came here two of the nights we were here and the food is pretty good! It would be very ideal if you like fish also! Definitely worth a visit, you can get a good feed for around Â£3.50.
4
Restaurant prices are scary in Singapore to say the leastEven the food courts in major shopping malls are xxxxyIf you dont mind crowds and no table service (or indeed no table) this place is a cracker!!600 ml Chinese beer for 5 bucks and the best chicken for 30 cents a piece Variety that goes on forever and the store owners happy to help non local
3
I was disappointed by the food I had here. It may be 'authentic' but it was distinctly average at best. The cleanliness does not bother me at all, but I had two different items from different stalls, and I wasn't really impressed with either. Maybe I was just unfortunate seeing as lots of other reviewers wax lyrical.I think the high rating is misleading. The reviews here will all be for many different stalls so it is impossible to see the granularity behind the high rating. Maybe some stalls are brilliant, others are probably not.
5
Head over to this hawker centre in Singapore most unique way of tasting our local foods. Not to miss the western food that has the best taste of all despite being a little normal but u will be blow away by its taste. Looks normal from the outside but trust what I say it taste great! And of course the popiah store facing the main road outside!
5
The best local hawker food center to go to. There is so many stalls worth trying that you'll probably spend more time fighting over decisions on what to eat than actually eating. It is said that the stalls on the front row are the best but I'm not sure - all the stalls are really good. I'll usually head for the barbecue seafood for grilled stingray. Then walk around to look for a table near another stall to try something else
4
Too much variety that we regret we cant eat more. We are able to find nice food there but also difficult to find seats during peak hours.
3
I went there for lunch one time while on a business trip to Singapore. wasn't impressed all over that only i can say. They can do much better with some changes.
5
Definitely worth the short trip on the MRT. Our favourite hawker centre, and the xiao long bao, at SGD$3.50 for 5 was a bargain. Iâ€™m still dreaming of them.
5
The food at this centre is very good I had fried oysters which is personal favourite.
My wife had satay sticks and rice
Prices pretty good.
Tiger beer $3.25
Mainly locals
Close to the lower singapore
5
You have to come visit yourself...worth coming with a big group while ordering all the different goodies and share~ The Lor Mee you have to come earlier to Q up.. The kuay chap abit let down (smell nice but taste not to the tip yet) Many many gathers here and u can just go in Town to shop after that
4
When One visits singapore, the best place to taste n have a true singapore experience is to visit the local hawker center! It is a place where all kinds of local food/delicacy/cuisine gathers within a roofed space and serves individually to the public. With free seating spaces, u just visits each stalls and buys the food which interests u! Old Airport FC is one of the best as it is quite centrally located, it is not touristy, local visits there too! Food here are a lot to choose but there are some that will require a longer wait due to the popularity! Lor Mee (braised noodle with pork and fish), wanton noodle (egg noodle with char siew and dumpling) , Satay (local Chinese version served with pineapple chutney mixed with peanut sauce),And many more are worth trying! The idea is go in a group of 4-6paxs and order to share! Don worry about etiquette as it is common to share food! You get to try everything at a go! The cue is when there is a string of ppl queuing, the food will not be that bad! Have a go! U will not regret it!
4
Went to Old Airport Road Food Centre specially for the famous Lor Mee. The best Lor Mee I've ever tasted as a bowl full with sardine fish, gravy, mee etc. There are a few more stalls which are famous in Singapore. Just look for the various signs displayed on the stalls which showcase how many magazines/ TV programs had interviewed them before
3
This is one of the oldest food centres in Singapore, I was told and that must be the reason why the place is not well-maintained and not clean and hygienic if compared with other food centres.There were many stalls in this entire building and you could notice that most were very seasoned and tired stalls. It is very crowded during lunch time and there were some stalls that had quite long queues waiting while others were doing average business and during the peak of lunch, you can hardly find a seat. We joined the queues at some stalls but found the food to be "nothing to shout about" and average if compared with other food courts, probably past its heyday. Accessibility is good as it is across from the Dakota mrt station and for those who drive, there is ample open air parking in front and a public car park at the back
4
The Old Airport Road Food Centre at 51 Old Airport Road is one of the oldest food centres in Singapore , It lies opposite the Dakota MRT station on the Circle Line.This food centre is crowded on weekdays at lunch time as office workers and students flock here for their lunch. There is a multi storey carpark and an open-air carpark behind the food centre and parking is not a problem.Some of the better stalls are those selling prawn rolls, curry fish head and char siew rice.If you see a long queue of customers this is an indication that the food is excellent and diners do not mind waiting for 15 min for their food.The Ali Shan curry fish head is one of the best stalls here and the cost is only $15 per fish head. There are other stalls selling poh piah, mango puddings, banana cakes and char kuey teow. The service is good and stall holders are very polite towards customers. Some stalls also accept payment by scanning the QR code on your mobile phone
3
They say this is the largest food court in Singapore. If you don't have a clue how large it is, I'd say it's about 3-4 times larger than Maxwell food court in Chinatown. To get here, take MRT yellow line, get off at Dakota station and walk 5 minutes. If you stay at Geylang, you can walk here not too far. This food court is a real housing area, surrounded by hundreds of apartment blocks everywhere. Great variety of foods, inexpensive, real local dining experience
4
Love the ambience and the authenticity of the food.
Not mention, it's very cheap for Singapore standard.
I try Char Kway Teow (from Lau Fu Zi counter) and Rojak.
Nearest MRT station : Dakota.
See the photo at my instagram : @adjimantoro
4
This is certainly not on the tourist trail, I think we were the only non resident, this is not expat either. Wonderful outing for anyone whot wants to sample good Singapore food at very good value.
5
It has the best assortment of good food in singapore They have the famous Rojak, Prawn Mee, Char Kway Teow, Fried Hokkien Prawn Mee, Wanton Mee, Western Food, Kway Chap, Xiao Long Bao, Oyster Omelette , Fried Carrot Cake and many more Its a must to visit this place when you are in Singapore to try out all the good local delicacy!
5
One of the more renowned hawker centers in Singapore, a must try for foodies of local fare. Some more notable stalls are those selling "big Prawn noodle", "hokkien mee", and the "Lao fu zi char kuay teow". Else you could just join one of the long queues :
5
Conveniently located about 5mins walk from Dakota MRT (Exit 2, turn right, cross the overhead bridge).Plenty to choose from, mainly locals and only a handful of tourists so less crowded than the likes of Lau Pa Sat or Maxwell though lunch times you can expect this place to be very busy.Tried various stalls:Carrot Cake #01-156Genie Foods curry puff #01-157Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow #01-12Homemade Springroll #01-94Albert Street Prawn Noodle #1-10Would rate most of these 4-5 stars. Loads of stalls that sell drinks, try the freshly squeezed sugar cane. Worth sitting on the outer parts of the hawker centre as it's much cooler. Definitely recommend coming here
5
Singapore Best and Cheap Nasi Briyani Dam (steamed rice with spices).SELERA RASA is an old establishment in Singapore well-known for its very delicious Nasi Briyani Dam. Their menu consists of curry mutton, curry chicken, fried chicken and fried fish. Choose any type of meat you like, it is very delicious. Though the price of meat including steamed rice is only SGD$3.00, the briyani is of top quality. If you like Singapore street food, this is the stall that you must visit at this hawker centre. And this stall is HALAL certified.Located at Stall #01-42 Old Airport Road Hawker Centre, 51 Old Airport Road. Open from Monday to Friday, 10am to 2pm or while stock last. The nearest MRT stations to the hawker centre are Mountbatten or Dakota Station @Circle Line. Attached photo shown the kind-hearted proprietor, she sell her Nasi Briyani Dam at the price of the 1900s
1
Went here to grab a quick snack gave her a $20 she gave me change and quickly rushed me off and noticed a few minutes later I was short the amount owed. I came back and demanded the rest of my money. Avoid at all costs or have exact change. Hope the Singapore police notice this scam
5
If you can't find anything to satisfy your tastebuds.... awesome Laksa, Chicken Rise, Curries, Wonton Noodles etc. My highlight is the Roast stall 121, called ROAST PARADISE. This will change forever your standard for roasts..Char Siew, Roast Pork with rice (or noodles)...AmazinG! Just go there and try it for yourself, be prepared to queue a while as you most likely won't be the only one
4
On an island where there are countless food courts, the hawker centre is king for the widest range of affordable food options. But some hawker centres are more well-known than others, and these often rest on the reputations (rightly or otherwise) of several particular stalls. And so it is with Old Airport Road Food Centre whose popularity is very dependent a number of stalls for which plenty of ink has been devoted over the years. Some of these include stalls selling char kway teow, roasted meats, fried hokkien noodles, Chinese-style rojak, and lor mee. But come and explore with an open mind and preferably a big appetite, and there's bound to be something considered satisfying for any individual
5
been here every few months since 2013. has been my go-to for affordable and yummy local food. large variety with the best quality you can findbelow are my recommendations1. lao fu zi char kway tiao (fried kway tiao with cockles)2. lao ban dao huey (pudding beancurd)3. XO fish bee hoon (yellow coloured stall near entrance/exit)4. hokkien mee (fried yellow noodles with prawn, find the stall with the most article reviews)5. satay (BBQ meat on a stick, find the toa payoh stall
4
Went there because we were at the east. Had a wonderful dinner because you have so many choices to make. It is quite hot inside and parking is an issue. However, all worth because there are many goof food!
4
Went here with family for dinner. I just love eating at Hawker centres. The food is great and the atmosphere is the best.
This centre is quite large, with a great selection of dishes to choose from.
4
Amazing array of food choices in a well managed centre that has a market stall vibe. Cheap and tasty.
5
One of the better hawker areas found, with an unlimited amount of food from satay, chilli crab, local and malay food etc.great price, costing us $30 for three plus beer.
5
Went at 11am and the crowds were not too busy
Found there to be plenty of seating and a good selection of cheap and tasty food.
Probably our favourite hawker centre in SG
5
Visited here on a Hello Singapore food tour for Carrot Cake and Rojak. Place was busy but plenty of places to sit. If i was to go here by myself i would definitely be spoilt for choice at the delicious food!
5
The place is so crowded at night, especially after office hour.
A lot of choice when it comes around food. The asian cuisine, malay, western food, everything is worth to try.
I highly recommend to try the Lao Ban bean curd stall
4
If you love authentic local food in a pretty relaxed atmosphere you'll enjoy old airport food centre. The great thing about the place is definitely the variety of local, mostly chinese originated cuisine. There are seafood stores, that sell everything from crabs, cockles and clams, to prawns and all other types of shellfish. There are local snack style stores for satay and oyster omelette and chicken wings to the occasional Thai and Vietnamese seafood style hawkers. You can also find local style noodle dishes from Hokkien Mee to Hor Fan and other varieties, as well as more traditional porridge stores with a wide variety of side dishes from frogs legs to cooked liver. There's also localised-western style places for chicken chops and steaks. Whatever your taste of food your sure to find something delicious that can be washed down with a beer with a couple ice cubes thrown in to keep it cool.
5
Stopped here many times on a trip to Singapore. Definitely my favourite Hawker Centre (much better than the more touristy ones in China Town). Good atmosphere and food is cheap but so good.Would recommend Hin Fried Hor Fun with prawn, beef & sliced pork as well as Ah Yee Hong Kong Roasted. Both stall owners are so friendly and the food is quality for the price paid.
4
We (a group of six people) were fortunate to visit this Hawker center along with a couple who lives in Singapore. They ordered lots of local favorite food for us, so we could try a little bit of everything. Chinese cale, swordfish, fried octopus, chili crabs, chicken satay.... lots of interesting stuff, and not too expensive. Well worth a visit
3
Heard so much about this place. Good variety of food stalls. Long queues at the popular stalls. Overall it feels the same as any other hawker centre with a few stalls that stands out.
5
I love this place. So much variety and it's so cheap. Eat where the locals eat! It's a nice short walk from Dakota or Mountbatten train stations. Highly recommended
5
the to-go place for a wide variety of local food at friendly prices. the roast pork and char siew rice is a must try.
5
Old airport is a good place to go for young and old.there is fat man satay , Japanese food,and the usual food you would find at a hawker center.delicious.will come again.this is second generation fat man satay.less yummy than long ago.but still super good!!!
5
There is plenty to choose from at a very reasonable price. I visited twice, once I ordered a chicken teriyaki dish (picture included) and another chicken katsu curry both only costing $5. Really enjoyed the experience and everyone seems friendly.
5
Wanting to try a few Hawker food centres on our trip to Singapore, we made the trip to this centre. About 10 mins via taxi from Bugis.There is an endless choice of eating options here, from Malaysian, Singaporean, Indian, Japanese, satay, seafood etc.We enjoyed a mixed plate of Indian curries, satay, Japanese bento box, wonton soup and a pork curry. All were excellent, and ranging in price from $3.50 to $8 for the Bento box.Finding a table can be challenging, but find one first and take turns ordering your meal
4
This renovated food center has a few stalls selling our favourite local food. The prices are very reasonable and the food is delicious. If you love a taste of local food then this is one you should not miss. Which are the stalls with good stuff - just follow the queues of people. Haha but be prepared to wait
4
Placed few blocks from my hotel at Geylang, this food centre has so many stalls, bit confuse to choose one of the stalls. i choosed intestine prawn noodle at Albert Street Prawn Noodle stall. Payed $5 per bowl i queued about 15 minutes. Good taste with affordable pric
5
Fair enough, prices of street food have been steadily on the uprise. But it is still cheaper to eat street food than to have a meal at a fancy restaurant with service and aircon. Perhaps on hotter days, but otherwise evenings are rather cool in Singapore and you'd be blessed with the smells of food cooking and the sights of beautifully cooked food at this food centre.Many many stalls await you to try their special dish. And I promise you will be spoilt for choice, cos you can't possible devour all there is on offer.Choose wisely. Go for less spicy or not spicy at all (if you're a wimp and you can't handle spice). Add it all up, eating here (from several stalls) is still cheaper than having a buffet at a fancy hotel cafe
3
We usually visit Old Airport Road Food Centre at least once a month. The food centre is one of the bigger ones in Singapore and has many stalls serving a wide selection of food e.g. zi char, mutton soup, mixed seafood soup, bbq seafood, satay, etc. The prices are quite reasonable but it can be a nightmare, during dinner time, due to the crowd.
4
There are many good stalls in this food centre. However, there are many food center in Singapore and you don't have to travel all the way just to visit this center
5
There is plenty to choose from and the prices are great, the smell and taste is unbelievable, a must try when you visit.
5
This place offers a wide variety of food. I like the kway chap, lor mee, prawn noodle soup, white fried kway teow and soursop juice.
4
biggest hawker market in Singapore, so many authentic food options here its crazy, good food and cheap as well
4
There are lots of restaurants to choose from. We tried the Indian cuisine and it was good, chili though. I like the propiah samosa the most. It's a must place for food lovers.
5
This is the place to go to if you want to be spoilt for food choices. My personal favourites are the bbq stingray (spicy), satay and lala (aka stir fried clams). For drinks, just go for a large cup of sugarcane juice. Bring tissue/wet wipes along, and dress like it's summer
3
Old airport road food centre only has one vegetarian stall. The stall is manned by a elderly couple who has little smiles and a "take it or go" attitude. Their name is similar to another stall at Circuit Road Food Centre. Food wise, there are limited choices available too. I ordered a stir fry kailan dish, broccoli stir fry and a egg omelette for take away. It was average, I especially like the broccoli texture. Their mee goreng(stir fried Malay noodles) is really good, which I ordered once before.Should tr
4
Billed as Singapore,s largest hawker market, and just a short walk from Dakota MRT station, this is a great place to try a huge range of local foods. Lots of famous stalls with big queues of locals, we really enjoyed the Roast Paradise stall with great roasted porks, but there are many, mainly Chinese and Malay, stall and lots of sweets and drinks. Soursop juice is a must. As in all hawker areas, the food is usually cheap and great value and is great for lunch or dinne
4
This is one of the favourite food centre among the locals. Inexpensive and loads of variety to choose from. If you do not know what to choose, those with a queue is worthwhile trying but the waiting time could be up to 30mins or more. One of my favourite stall is right at the far end selling local ku chye kueh (chinese chives). This stall has been around for the past 40 plus years. My family loves the kueh and we can never get enough of it. Another good stall to look out for is the hokkien fried prawn noodle
4
Went there for a meal with some friends and it was a great busy atmosphere. We felt out of place being the only apparent westerners but everyone was friendly and helpful. We thought it was a bit cramp until we found more seating in a middle corridor. The bear was cheap as well compared to tourist places
4
There are many options here at old airport food centre. You can have different types of hawker food. It can be quite pack during peak lunch and dinner hours.
5
My niece and family took us there for dinner last night. We ordered a whole variety of dishes which were very tasty and inexpensive.
Will recommend this place. Worth revisiting for more yummy and trying different types of food.
4
Came late at night(around 11pm) to satisfy the hunger. Tried black carrot cake and oyster omelette, taste was nice, and also cheap too(prices around $3-9). Places is quite big for hawker center, with many variations of food stall
5
Can try many different food. can eat from end to end. So many local foods that can eat! Great place.
4
Easy to find and tons of option!! We stuck with the safe bet of teriyaki but there was plenty of bits we were scared to try (frog porridge)! Great opportunity to try loads as it's cheap for Singapore!
4
All the foods here are very good and afforable !
Been here every week twice , its a must visit place for foodies .
5
We got here by smrt and a 5 minutes walk.
After finding a table we took off for food.
Lots to try and the food stalls we ate from were really nice.
Nice to sit with locals and get some advise.
5
Singaporean here, one of my fav food centres in Singapore. If you looked at the top rated food places in Singapore, it's either an expensive restaurant or cafÃƒÂ© which is fine, but do try out the authentic Singaporean food at our food centres or hawker centres and it's really CHEAP (a good meal for 3 USD, if you want to splurge it's still below 8 USD and very filling). Join the stall with a long queue, you won't go wrong with that but most stalls are pretty good. My favourite is Lor Mee which is noodles with this thick black gravy and fish, very foreign food for foreigners.. it's only available in the morning though, likewise some stalls only operate at night. Other good food centres I recommend are Maxwell Food Centre and Hong Lim Food Centre, if you feeling adventurous venture to Geylang Serai and try the Malay food it is great :
4
This place is just like another hawker food center, busy and crowded with people. It has so many food stalls that offer wide range of food. I need some time to walk around to decide what food should I order. One thing that's for sure, the price is very reasonable. If you love to explore hawker foods, this place is definitely for you
5
Was back to Singapore for a week for work. Although have worked in Singapore for a few years and been to a few hawker center, this was my first time there. Spoilt for choices even though there were a few popular stalls were closed as it was the Vesak holiday.Highly recommend this place if you are ever in Singapore. Easy to reach as the center is walking distance from Mountbatten or Dakota MRT station.Miss my satay and it was heavenly when I had my first bite of the satay. You just can't get the right satay taste in Sydney. Gulp it down with sugar cane juice with lime...Ooh!
5
Although this food court is far away from the downtown, you can tried the good food when you see there is long queue, the satay and curry puff are good, the fried noodle is sweet and the seafood inside is fresh and delicious
5
Wide selection of food for any time in the day. Hardly any tourists. Highly recommended, go for the stalls with queues like any good Singaporean does! :)
5
A favourite haunt, always good food with plenty of choice. Recommend the popiah on the front row and curry puff's on the back row. Sit at the edge as cooler than inside.
5
My all time favourite hawker centre. There's so many diff local food to choose from and most of them are really good!
4
I thought before that food in Singapore was lack of flavor, and i was mistaken because usually i ate at food court inside a mall. So, on my last trip there i went to different hawker centre everyday. I go to this place taking a bus from orchard road, no need to change bus. The bus can take me directly to the bus stop just next to this place.I take bus #16 from midpoint orchard opposite of orchardgateway mall.It was saturday around 6.30 pm but few stalls i already have in mind was not open.So i have to circling the place to find other stalls. I bought the chicken claypot rice, the stall is quite popular as they even have queuing device which can beep beep when our order is finish. But the food was tasteless which make me have to add more soy sauce and chili to add more flavor but it not helpful at all, and the rice at the bottom of the pot was already dry and hard from the long cooking. I also try laksa noodle which has better taste and it serves hot so i'm satisfied with that.I also try Lao Ban soya beancurd for dessert, taste okay. And Wang Wang curry puff which I say don't have the kicking curry flavor
3
It offers a lot of food varieties in this massive hawker centre. Good selection of good local food.Many stores having long queue. I do not recommend this place for social outing. Queue for food, queue for drinks, queue for dessert, no service. Hate the birds around too
5
SO much choice. Love the Wang Wang Crispy Curry Puff here, as well as the oyster omelette, char kway teow and Lao Ban Tau Fa. Too much choice here, oh and the otah is pretty yummy too! Both at lunch and dinner ties, as well as breakfast, this place is absolutely buzzing!!!! Don't miss it - if you do, you're missing out!!

Used to stay Old Airport Road during my childhood with my family and aunts.Last Saturday night (8 Apr 2017) took my aunts back to this hawker centre for dinner. A place that brought back lots of memories.It was 8.05pm on a Saturday night. The hawker centre was packed with people. Mang patrons waited for seats. Queue at most stalls. Place was congested and warm. Got ouf table about 15 minutes wait.Had these few dishes for dinner. 20 sticks of satay ($12), Rojak ($6), 5 bbq chicken wings ($6.50), 3 popiah ($4.20), cuttlefish kankong ($4).All food were tasty except cuttlefish kankong. After dinner (about 9pm), the crowd subsided.Enjoyed this dinner with great company. Will bring them someday again on weekday which will be less congested
5
Undisputed king of Hawker centres. Largest variety of food choices. My favourite is the prawn noodles. Of the few stalls available, my vote goes to the Whitely prawn noodles. Also a favourite is the chay Kway teow. Ng to be missed is the Hougang wanton noodles. Finish your meals with freshly made curry puffs that are generous with stuffing. One drawback is the lack of seats during meal times, especially during weekends. It is pity that this place is not open 24 hours.
5
100+ stalls, each with exotic & extraordinary delicious food sold by passionate sellers! I enjoy:1. Nam sing hokkien fried mee (4/5)2. Toa payoh rujak (4/5)3. Wangwang crispy curry puff: blackpepper flavor (4/5)4. Sugar cane water (5/5)5. Soursoup juice (5/5)6. Selera Rasa nasi kebuli (4.5/5)You can get Sugarcane water everywhere in this Foodcentre but try to drink from a stall near Selera Rasa Nasi kebuli, sold by a fun guy riding an edgy bicycle-wheelchair around the corner. The sugarcane was amazingly indulging! A refrehing natural sugarcane, no additional sugar! Reminding me of my childhood :)We are also being recommended Whitley Rd big prawn mee but we were so full, barely can insert anymore food LO
5
Very good with a wide range of local Singaporean food, but sometimes have to wait for at least half an hour especially Sat and Sun Evening. Butâ€™ itâ€™s worth going there. We were so glad to experience so much local food culture here.
5
A lot of Good local food, but sometimes have to wait for at least half an hour especially Sat and Sun Evening
5
this hawker food centre has a great selection of food all looked great at reasonable prices tried 3 dishes all 1st class
5
We met up with friends at the Old Airport Food Centre! we were so lucky to experience so much local food culture here. Try the black and white carrot cake and the lor mee.So many stalls and such good food!
5
This place have so many choice of food, and many of the look and smell tasty.I tried fried wonton noodle on #2 stall, prawn noodle on #10. The wonton noodle is yummy, and the prawn is fresh.This is recommended place for hawker food hunter
5
Where do the locals go to avoid the tourists? Here. When my wife and I arrived about 7.00pm the centre was packed , but hardly a non Asian in sight. There are well over one hundred stalls offering everything Asian, all at very reasonable prices. My minced chicken with chilli (lots) and basil was $5.00, my Carlsberg beer was $7. My wife chose a fruit drink and a prawn with curry sauce dish. Her cost was $15. Some stalls seemed more popular than others with several queues of ten or twelve but the service is so fast that you do not have to wait long. If arriving by MRT, alight at Dakota and when facing Old Airport Road turn right. After about five minutes you will see the Food Centre. A tip; try to find a table either outside or on the outer edge of the centre as the inside temperature is several degrees warmer. Highly recommended

Very good with a wide range of local Singaporean food. This place is patronised only by locals so quality of food is very high and its typical of an authentic hawker centre. One speciality is the Rojak and I've been there many times for this at lunchtime. It can seem overwhelming as you walk in and see over a hundred places to eat. Its near Dakota MRT and lots of buses nearby. Parking available at the back

Visited Old Airport Road Hawker Centre for dinner last night (2 March 2017).It was a Thursday evening, many stalls were closed. Not many people having dinner. Many parking space still available. Least expect that there were no crowd at the peak hour (7.30 - 8pm).Observed queue at the chicken rice stall. Decided to have chicken rice for dinner. Reasonable portion with sliced chicken separated from rice. Really appetising for a decent hawker's meal for $3.Enjoyed

This is a Hawkers centre frequent by locals.Definitely not a tourist trap place with sky high prices.So many wonderful stalls to eat and mostare good.My all time Favourites ; prawn noodle soup, Lor mee , oyster omelette, fried Kway Teow, western food w special garlic sauce drizzle 
5
Lao Fu Zi Char Kway Teow is one dish that you should never MISSED. The Prawn Noodles soup is another dish that your saliva will keep dripping even at the look of the dish. Fried Hokkien Noodles and Fishball Noodles are excellent choices for those people who only like noodles and the popular ones are just right behind the Food Centre (it is also economically inexpensive). Only one of the stalls that sell Lor Mee is really good. Sometimes many people who like it will queue for as long as 45 minutes but they still Q-U-E-U-E. That really exhibits the power of this stall's Lor Mee.The food centre is clean and spacious and there plenty of seats around though at times (during the peak hours) you can wait as long as 15 minutes for your ideal seats
4
Good food, so manny tenant that make you confused to choose your menu. Its open air- food center and crowded in wkends. Asian food with Singapore style
5
Lots of food choices and drinks. Cheap and very affordable. Best to explore Singapore food through Hawker Centres like this.
5
We stayed just down the round from here and stumbled across it by mistake... needless to say we are very glad we did! We ate here whenever we got the opportunity.There are so many different options, everyone is extremely friendly, the food is insanely cheap and it's incredible. We didn't have one bad dish the entire time and I think we spent 50$ over about a week, saved us so much money. Our taxi driver told us this is the place he would recommend going as it's the most authentic Singaporean food center he knows of. I would highly recommend it and I'll be going back if I'm ever in Singapore again
5
Singapore is serious about their eating and this food center, among many, doesn't disappoint. We came back three times and couldn't get enough. I agree with another reviewer that I would eat here all the time if I lived here. Cheap and great food. I recommend the fried kway teow at Dong Ji stall #138, big prawn noodles at Whitley Road #98, and won ton noodle soup at Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wan Ton Mee #2. I am sooo hungry right now after writing this review
4
Read about this hawker food court and convenient to access via the SMRT getting off at the Dakota stop and then a 5 minute walk. Got there too early that only half the stalls were open. Suggest getting then after 11 am. None the less, had a good selection of food stalls open. My wife and I walked around twice before we purchased our food because of the huge selection. Very affordable. We maybe spent less than $20 Singapore dollars for lunch and we were very satisfied
5
Another of those hawker centre that you find all over Singapore. This place also has it all. Malay, Chinese, Western food are available. Food are cheap and good. You can take the train here and walk to the food centre which is about 5mins away. Be advised that there are more stalls open during dinner than lunch time, but during lunch time it not so crowded and easy to get a table
5
As someone obsessed with Singaporean hawker food, I felt like I just landed in paradise. Full with rows of food shops offering various hawker food, and plenty of seats and tables,it was very easy to get what you want here. I had the famous fried kwey tiaw at one shop on the corner (can't remember the name) for 10 SGD. The queue was long but it was relatively fast. When we ate, someone came and asked us if we would like to order drink from his shop. Everybody was very nice.Most of the food shops are accredited A or B by the government so you can eat at ease without the worry about getting stomach problem.I will definitely come back here
5
We only went to the Hawker food Centre in Old Airport Road as we were staying with friends nearby who took us. It's the sort of place I wouldn't give a second glance at normally as I'd be suspicious about the food quality and I wouldn't know where or what to order. It's esentially dozens and dozens of small food businesses with open shop fronts in a large undercover, but outdoor, area. My friend, a fellow Brit, who'd been living in Singapore for 3 years had it all under control. We whizzed from shop to shop ordering one dish here, another there, drinks at another. Then retraced steps to pick up food that was being cooked fresh for us. We took it all back to her apartment and had a veritable delicious feast. When I asked her later how she knew which shop to go to she said she only went to the ones with an 'A' food hygiene rating - apparently it's displayed for the public to see. 'C' is the worst. And some she went to she'd got to know the owners so there was a nice friendly raport going on.All I can say is, if you are in Singapore forsake the posh, smart looking (and doubtless pricey) restauarants, and give this a go for a genuine local experiece you will always have fond memories of
5
For a person who is into trying out new dishes,this place is a one stop food joint.Singapore has a lot of centers like this some small and this place was pretty big in comparison.Great choices and reasonably priced,one can go into a gastronomical coma here :
5
Old airport road, a place which I used to hang around when I was a kid and during my teens. In those days, there were numerous good Hawkers serving very nice Singapore street favourites. Dishes like Orh Jian, Char Kway Teow, wanton Mee, this list can go on and on and on. Today, when you go down to this place. Some old school Hawkers still remain there, you will also see some new age Hawkers serving? New age Favourites or what the youngsters prefer nowadays, such as Pasta, Japanese ramen etc. Overall, going to this Hawkers centre anytime will not disappoint you.
4
This is still one of my favorite non-aircon hawker centers in Singapore. When I bring visiting foreigners to sample local fare, I avoid Newton Hawker Centre & bring them here instead! Most stall holders are friendly & are bilingual in Mandarin & English.
4
Old Airport Rd. Food center was recommended to us by some locals in Singapore - it was nice to visit a less touristy Hawker. We had the Keuh Pa ti and popiah and both were fantastic! Bus station and train station nearby for easy trip
5
#01-69 Airport road . Is really nice. Sliced Red Grouper Fish Soup with Spinach Soup. Fantastic combo ! They are not open on Thursday.
4
This is just a few minutes walk from us- so much variety and always something to tempt me and delight my overseas visitors
5
I recommend the prawn noodle , fried oyster and BBQ chichen . It's really yummy. I have been there many and many times. Don't forget try the fresh fruit juice
5
You get many very good local food at this Food Centre. They are very cheap & clean. Definitely worth going.
5
Went here for the afternnon on a stay over. Definitely the best hawker food, it's where the locals go. Not really for tourists which is why it is so great. The people are super friendly and love a chat with visitors. Meals a re cheap and extremely delicious. I spent 6 hours here enjoying the food, cheap beer and fantastic local
5
The best and unique popiah I've tried so far. There's a crunch and sweetness between the fresh ingredients each bite. I tried this with chilli; not too spicy making me enjoy the food without having to doze on much water.Definitely a must try. Stall number: #01-94 | Purple signboar
5
This is a good place to really try out good local cuisines - true Singaporean style, without the touristy hypes. Individual stalls are own by individual owners serving local and localized foreign cuisines. Some store owners were voted best for the type of food they serve. But if you do visit, do not trust the stickers/certificates that are attached on the stall front. Just judge which stall is more popular by comparing the queues formed right in front of them. Singaporean don't mind queueing for good food, and thats the best way to guess which suites the local tastebuds better. Food are a lot cheaper than the popular tourist spots and taste better too. But not all types of food may be accustomed to the taste buds of foreign visitors
4
I come here most weekends for the local food fare. It's inexpensive, ease of parking and great choice of food. I usually go for the Mei Xiang Lor Mee - noodles dish in a thick gravy and thick flat yellow noodles . The thick gravy is made of corn starch, spices and eggs. The ingredients added into the noodles is fish as topping , thin slices of meat with half a boiled egg. Vinegar , red Chili and garlic can be added if you like. The other one is the Kway Chap -dish of flat, broad rice sheets in a soup made with dark soy sauce, served with pig intestines, braised duck meat, various kinds of beancurd, fish cake and braised hard-boiled eggs. You can find a specialised stalls that just sells Chee Cheong fun find best curry puffs.Not a place to expect ambience. Tables are free for all to sit around, free seating and most times you make need to share a table with others.
5
Cheap and good... has everything you can find under one roof. Convenient location accessible by bus or train.
5
Good price and good food. It's a huge food court in open air. Food there is reasonably priced. The chili crab and butter crab with fried mantou is delicious. Go to Chan Loo Bee Hokkien food for the crabs and mantou
5
One of the few iconic food centre of Singapore with a few national famous stalls. For breakfast, besides the usual kopi, half boiled eggs and toast with kaya & butter, there's also a few stall for lor mee. There's just a good vibe here.
4
Nearest MRT should be Mountbatten MRT Station. Good and reasonable price for the food, more variety of local food to choose.. This is the good place to have a meal.
5
There are many nice food here like:1. Whitley Big Prawn Noodle2. Albert Street Big Prawn Noodle3. Matar Road - Crab4. Lor mee5. Toa Payoh Rojak6. etc etcand they are all well known local hawker that is really good.many variety of foods in this oldest hawker centre in Singapore
4
I never get tired of this hawker centre. There are numerous stall selling delicious local fares. Tourist should be prepare to bear with the heat and crowd. Here are some store that worth a try. Holy Grill for Western, Xing Li for Fried Oyster Omelette, Toa Payoh Rojak and Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee. Search google for other recommendations. A food tasting adventure.
5
I met some friends at this food court on Saturday evening and was surprised at the number of stalls and how big was the place. Must be easily 300 tables available. The food was excellent and not expensive. Tables were cleared and cleaned promptly so finding somewhere to sit is not an issue. Public conveniences in Singapore are monitored and rated and here, although basic, were very clean and well maintaine
5
This is my usual haunt for local food. And my local showcase for overseas visitors. I'm disappointed only when the stall I want to eat at is closed!All time favourites include Hougang wanton noodles and Aunty Oats pancake (ask nicely for your favourite edge and she'll usually acquiesce). Too many to name..
5
Bustling place even late sunday night.Prices reasonable and lots of variety local yummy food.Relatively clean even late at night. Tables plenty full and dishes clear away quite fast.Come for a feast w friends or alone without worry no tasty food available late night
5
Jumped in a taxi on a Sunday from Holiday Inn Orhard City centre. When telling the taxi where we wanted to go he was very surprised that we knew about the location and said that only locals knew about that place. Explained to him that a couple of friends who are locals recommended us to go there.  Got there about 9am and had quite a few places open. All the regular Singapore breakfast favourites. In true Singaporean fashion we lined up for the Lor Mee store which had a big queue purely because it was the busiest. Was well worth the wait as it was delicious. Have to admit I didn't even know what Lor Mee was but figured if everyone was getting it then it'd probably be good. Also managed to order some steamed rice paper rolls with BBQ pork and also prawns, century egg, lean meat rice porridge, and stir fry carrot cake (savory not sweet)Tips here are if you know a bit of basic Chinese it will go along way when ordering. Most attendants are pretty abrupt and short with customers but that's normal so don't mistake this for being rude, it's just their way of life. Also bring cash as they don't have card facilities. Everything is pretty cheap ranging from $3-6SGD per dish. Bring your own wet wipes/tissues as they generally don't provide them for you. You won't find many tourist here but a great sign you are mixing with the locals and eating as they do. Highly recommend it.

We have tried many hawker venues in Singpore, and if you really want to eat what the locals eat. This is the place to go. Some interesing outets. Everything cooked fresh and fast. Cleanish. Not for the fussy tourist. We enjoy this type of experience.
5
This Hawker center has a great range of good food and many of the 'must eat' versions of foods are here, not least the Rojak and probably the finest sate in the world.
Eat here. you deserve it.
5
for tourists, please don't bother to go Newton or lau pa sak for Singapore local food . Old airport road hawker is one of my favourite hawker in Singapore. huge varieties of good cheap food. it's accessible by mrt to Dakota station.
4
This is one of the more famous hawker Centres in Singapore. You will see perpetually long queues at some of the more popular stalls such as the ones selling Hokkien Mee, prawn noodles, Rojak and Lor mee. Nearest MRT is Mountbatten station.
5
This food court is considered by many Singaporeans to be one of the best. It is a huge food court with many stalls offering many of the best local dishes. There are ample parking lots around the court and a multi-story car park behind. Here are some of the most famous stalls: Nam Sing Hokkien Mee, Chuan Kee Satay, Toa Payoh Rojak, Dong Ji Fried Kway Teow, Roast Paradise (famous for Char Siew), Whitley Big Prawn Noodle, Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wanton Mee, etc. etc. You're spoilt for choice and you need to go there many times to try all the best dishes
4
I've been frequenting this hawker centre now for over 5years during which time I have never eaten anything other than top notch food . Infinite number of cuisines..all tastes catered for..just a couple of recommendations.......not easy with choice available...Wang Wang at 1-126 for the lightest flakiest curry puff imaginable and Roast Paradise at 1-121 for their crispy roast pork. ( only trouble here is the restricted opening hours ).find your own favourite!!!!
4
I say this is one of the truly Singaporean Hawker simply because there are so many it is hard not to find one... but finding one with a variety of stalls who collectively sell awesome food, now that is hard to find. You will be spoilt for choice - cheap and delicious food at a convenient location... via public transport, most notably the train. Parking on the other hand can be a real pain most of the time as it is usually crowded, especially on weekends
5
We tried Lau Par Sat a few days earlier but this place is much bigger with many more hawker stands to choose from. Some are self service pick up and some will deliver to your table so remember your table number when you go to order (and best to find a table before ordering!!).We sat in the aisle where table 128 was and I found the Char Kuay Teow, Congee, Ice Kacang in this aisle were all outstanding.If I have time to visit again before I leave Singapore, there are more vendors I want to try. If you're an overseas born Chinese like me and seek authentic flavours you miss at home, you'll love it here. It has the traditional hawker feel, not the sanitized feel of the shopping malls
4
Plentiful of variety, conveniently located near city and accessible by MRT, 'cheap and good' food. You know it's good when even the locals head there for their meals. If you are not sure what to try, either follow the queues or go for the stalls with awards.
5
This is a regular haunt for my family and friends. Hawker fare is comfort food. A place for a simple meal. Not always the healthiest of eats but this is the soul food of Asia.Just Juice It makes good juice. Ice blended soursop with sour plum is my go to. Owner Kelvin is a great chap.Food wise- I have a list of favourites.Nam Sing hokkien mee (miserable looking measly portion that doesn't include any sambal but super delicious and worth the wait). My average waiting time of 20-30mim. Whitney road prawn noodles. I like my noodles dry and my flavours intense. Lao fu zi char kway teowFreshly made Chee Cheong Fun (#01-155). Tucked in the quieter end of Old airport hawker Centre. I like the char Siew and prawn Chee Cheong fun.Toa Payoh rojak. Be prepared for a long long waitChinese pork satay with grated pineapple in peanut sauce. Otak - many stalls to choose from. I like the stall diagonal across from Just Juice It.I didn't include any traditional dessert stalls as I am not partial to any.Lots to discover and try.
5
They serve the toast breakfast, and their kopi most try very fragrance coffee taste, you will be carving for it.
5
One of the best food centres in Singapore. Personal favourite is the aglio olio at Pastamanna. Other good food worth trying include the Lao Fu Zi Char Kway Teow and the Cho Kee Wan Toon Noodles
4
This food centre is incredibly diverse. Many different dishes and selections. If you fancy a MacDonalds to authentic traditional dishes, it's here. Costs are reasonable and it is available 24 hours. Clean and comfy.
5
Had prawn noodle with pig tail n pork ribs! Very very nice !!! Soup also very tasty n can even ask for soup top up !
5
Theres awesome food here. Try out Roast Paradise or Hougang Wanton Mee (red stall) or just google or walk around for food.
4
Another good hawkers centre in Singapore that provides good food for reasonable price. And comparing to the shops they have large amount of seating capacity.
4
This is the best place to go for famous food or lost & found stalls. Love the famous toa payoh rojak but be prepared to take a queue number. Try out the traditional chinese dessert stall which is reasonably priced. Fried oyster omelette is another must try item. If you are a noodle lover, queue up for the wanton noodle (red signage) along the stretch facing the main road.
5
We absolutely enjoyed our meal here. It was our first meal in Singapore. We tried the Curry Puffs but the lady insisted on giving us three for the price of two. They were delicious. Everyone were so polite and wanted to chat here. I next had Battered fish and chips. They were the best I've ever had as I expected them to be oily but they came out crispy. The fish was moist. Jan had sweet and sour fish which was very tasty. Beer and juices were also cheap and the juices were natural. Syrup was on the side. Another place we will be coming back too. Only problem here, is there's so much to choose from
5
To experience local culture and hawker culinary, Old Airport Rd Food Centre is the place to visit. It is located in an actual public housing area that is close enough to the city centre. This is one place that locals visit to satisfy their cravings, and for me it's got to be Hokkien Fried Prawn Noodles, Char Kway Teow, Rojak and Soursop DrinkÃ¢â‚¬Â¦if you are not sure, just ask for recommendation when you get there. Singaporeans are mostly friendly and helpful
5
The Hawker Center at Old Airport Road is one of the oldest and therefore most authentic ones of Singapore. If you create a Top Dishes List of all hawker center meals of the city, you will find most of the top ones at this center.Tofu Lovers, this is for you: the center is known for the best soya bean curd in town. The queue at Lao Ban Soya Beancurd und 51 Soya Bean Curd can be awfully long. A bowl with soup already starts at a price of 1,50 SGD (1 EUR)
5
Whatever you want, you get it there. Lots of varieties are very reasonable local price. Haven't eaten anything that tastes bad ... but many good ones, spoil for choices.
5
We had a number of different dishes from many of the places. All were really good!! Only a few sell beer and had to walk a long way to get again.
The beer gets hot quickly ask for ice!!
Worth the visit!
4
-i eat alot of satay in this food centre, the satay is very nice.
-i think the price more cheaper than the other food court.
-seafood also good , but need to waiting for 30 mnt hehee..
5
Old Airport Road Hawker is definitely one of the best hawker places in Singapore. Personally, I think that it is way better than Lau Pa Sat, Newton and Makansutra combined. One of the reasons is that the prices are still kept affordable for everyone to enjoy a good meal, be it for lunch or dinner. The stalls are very competitive, and as such, the ones who do not serve good food (according to the local tastebuds) would not see themselves survive for long. Watch out for stalls with long queues as they are probably the ones which serve better quality food but you may be surprised.For example, there is a Western food stall named Holy Grill which serve quality Western-style dishes for a very reasonable price. You would not see a line forming outside their stall as they used a buzzer system which would remind you when your food is ready for collection. Personally, I think that they are better than the average cafÃƒÂ© here, which may charge more than twice the price. Of course, you have to dine in a hawker setting, but if that Is not a concern, you would be happy with the food. Some of the dishes that I have tried and ordered again, would be their Fish & Chips, and Black Pepper Grilled Chicken.Another stall which I really enjoy patronising would be the J&J Special Beef Noodle. They specialize in Hokkien-Teochew style beef noodles. You may opt to have it in a soup or dry format. The affable couple who runs the business is very friendly and is very accommodating. I love the dry beef noodles as they make it just right in terms of texture, and the beef slices are very well seasoned and generous - enough to fill me up for a good dinner. Do take note that they close by 9pm.There are more than one stall which you should really check out, so best to go with a bunch of friends, and share your dishes to make the most of your foodie trip here. You may take the MRT to Dakota circle line exit B, or hop into a cab if you feel like treating yourself to a smooth enjoyable cool ride before sweating it out at the hawker.You can always rehydrate with a couple of big bottles of beer if you wish. And no, you can find other brands aside from Tiger beer, such as Heineken, Carlsberg, Anchor, Guinness Stout.... so worry not.Enjoy the food and I hope this helps
5
It is a very good place to hang out with friends and a lot of good food around here. If you don't want to get hot, sit near the road or sit outside, when the wind blow, it is so chill and comfortable. Great place to be in Sg!
5
If there is simply one Hawker centre you can go in Singapore, then make it Old Airport Road. This is because they have the widest selection and also all kinds of vendors here. Savour some of the best Char Kway Teow and Hokkien Seafood Noodles here. The hawker centre has been around for ages but underwent some renovations to keep it new and clean. I must say it gets really crowded here in the weekends. It is near the MRT Circle line Dakota. Advisable to take the MRT here as the parking is limited. A couple of buses service this area too mostly from Eunos and Bedok. As the area is near Payalebar Air base, the residential are rare low rise compared to the scary Skyrise in the nearby CBD, take a walk over at kallang river if you are feeling very full from the meal at the centre
4
Visited Old Airport Road Hawker Centre today.Decided to eat at Blanco Court Kway Chap one of the popular stalls in this hawker centre. The are closed on Monday and Tuesday, opened 11am - 3pm onlu. Long queue. About 15 minutes queue time. $18.20 for a set meal for 2 persons. Really tasty. Enjoyed. (Food is good for 3 persons who are little eater.)The place is little warm lack ventilation. Nevertheless they offered a good selection of local food. There's halal food section available too
5
I grew up in this place, there are many wonderful hawker stalls here , my favourite is the Toa payoh rojak, hokkien mee and fried kway teow , really yummy. Need to go to this place during off peak hours, else the queues for the popular stalls are very long but al worth the wait.
5
My one-stop food oasis to try some of the best Singapore's hawker food at affordable prices. This centre offers a huge variety of local dishes that pulls me back for more! Many of the dishes at Cuttle Fish Kangkong/Katong Laksa #01-99, for $4-6 per plate are very good. (I tried other stalls for the cuttle fish kangkung and this stall offers the best value and taste.)As I was craving for crab beehoon (rice noodles) and couldn't resist the offer of $48 for two crabs at Changi Seafood #01-72. I was not disappointed. The crab meat was solid and the beehoon had the slight smokey taste typical of a zi char dish. Yummy! (Psst! Zi char refers to a quick wet stir fry over very hot flames that will torch the noodle leaving a sumptuous smokey taste.)Other favourites include Lucky Char Kway Tiao (flat rice noodle in caramel sauce), Chong Pang Huat BBQ chicken wings, and Yi Ji Hokkien fried prawn noodle at #01-102. The prawn noodle comes with fresh lime, and a dash of power chilli (a spicy belacan - chili prawn paste) that delivers a punch. You may have to take a queue number when placing your order as cooking is done on a batch basis (about 20 plates per batch)Wondering or craving for Western BBQ, try as stall #01-53. The mixed grill and lamb chops are our favourites. Price ranges from $6 to 9.50 per plate.For drinks, Stall #01-15 offers strong local coffee and a refreshing homemade sour plum lime drink. Ciao for now
4
I heard about this place and came via the MRT - super easy to find. It was suggested I try BBQ stingray so I went on the hunt for that. I think there are over 168 stalls here and it took me a while to find it but I did and it was well worth it: spicy, tender and delicious. I went at about 6 before the rush so I didn't have trouble finding somewhere to sit but I think it would have been a more authentic experience when it is really busy
4
Came here several times for supper and each time trying different local food at fairly cheap price comparing to restaurants out there, pretty satisfying.
5
Have to try pork congee with black egg just $4 and try fish congee too.the seller is nice too.if you need to order more can call to order too,the off the seller is 90891575 name same like me david too.
4
Local food stalls, but less tourists than other food market in Singapore, had bbq satay, stir fried vermicelli, prawn mee and minced meat noodle soup. All dishes were well prepared.
4
This hawker street style food court is good .They have a variety of food outlets. The service is good.The prices similar to other ones.
4
We didn't go here for seafood. I wanted to try the chicken rice but none of the open stalls were serving it. We went here about 9 pm on a Monday night to find most of the stalls closed. After circling the place several times I finally decided on a duck and fried rice dish that ended up being completly tasteless. However, from a different stall we ordered a carrot cake (omelette) that was very well seasoned and after I mixed it with my duck and rice dish, I was able to enjoy my meal. Great experience, I would go again.....maybe even venture out and have the frog
4
This is an exhaustive hawker centre with a lot of variety. Some shops may sell the same items but they all do well. Not much options for vegetarian. Good choices for juices (they even give you loyalty cards which entitles you to a free drink after every 10 drinks). Surprisingly I really like the cream mushroom spaghetti from the Pasta Risotto stall (01-09 stall number). It's quite crowded and during peak hours it's tough to find a place to sit and eat.
4
Nice place to visit if you are looking for local hawker foods. Many old stalls are providing nice foods and maintain the high standard, just looks for stalls with long Q. You can find some old style teo-chew cooking zi-char stalls here that can serve you very nice steam fish or chilli crab with restaurant standard. Prices here had increased as compared with other hawker centre.Expect to Q and looks for table at peak hour
5
Old Airport Hawker Centre is well known for its locally cooked hawkers' food. The peak hour is between 7 - 9pm. Required to wait and find table. Also required to queue at every stall for food No waiter or waitress. Everything is basing on self service. Queued , ordered and collect basis. Shortest queue maybe about 10 minutes. Food is tasty and good at average prices.The place is noisy and warm when packed with people Nearest MRT will be Dakota Station, take Jalan Saturday Exit. Toilet is chargeable and not really clean. Limited parking space available
4
Like other typical hawker centres in Singapore, this one serves a wide variety of local cuisines like chilli crab, roasted pork, soya beancurd, chicken rice, wanton mee, etc at cheap and affordable prices. Most of the stalls here are veterans from very long ago and their standard of food remains the same throughout the years. It may be a little out of place for tourists to visit but it's definitely worth the visit if you're looking to try the "old" taste of Singapore
4
We had a mix of foods, but especially some chili crab and fish head soup. The local table guy who knew my friend took good care of us and kept us well- stocked with Tiger beers on ice. It cost 10 cent Sing for each visit to the Beer Rental Return but well worth it. There is an excellent variety of foods and stalls, and very few tourists, unlike Newton Corner and some other places
5
Worth the queue. Still retaining great tastes of braised innards. Certainly an all time favourite amongst the locals. As expected in local food centers, kind of hot and humid in Singapore weather
1
I read some good recommendations about this food center, however I cannot agree to that. The food was average as chicken rice and a roasted duck. There are several other food center which are a way better
4
There are some famous stalls that serve delicious food. There are some which are not so nice as well. I found this drinks stall at the side of row, which served excellent tea & coffee, as well as yummy chicken rice few stalls away.
5
My first Hawker's center turned out to be my favorite and one of the highlights of my Asia trip. Great food and good layout.Highlights:- Chay kway teow: mixed type of noodles in a soy like sauce was a hit. 5 stars.- Hor fun: wide rice noodles with gravy. 5 stars.- Carrot cake: rice patties with egg and a brown sauce was one of my faves. 5 stars- Meatball bao: soft bun and tasty big meatball hiding inside. 4.5 stars- Black pepper puff: didn't care that much about the famous curry puff but loved the black pepper version inside of the thick flaky exterior. 4.5 stars- Fresh juices: so good, I got 3. Blend the fruit with a bit of ice right there. 5 stars- Tofu: silky and just a bit sweet of a dessert. Meant to eat a few spoonfuls but almost ate the whole container. 4.5 stars - Noodles with minced meat: with and without soup with linguine type noodles were great. 4 stars- Layout: 2 long aisles with seating in between and outside under umbrellas Lowlights:- Few stalls closed on Sunday- Need coins to pay last for the toilet - My friend wanted fresh fruit for his kid but couldn't find it anywhere Got my 2 week trip off to an awesome start blissfully happy trying all of these dishes and would love to come back again

A traditional food centre in Singapore and one of the best. All the local favourites here and some of the best stalls in Singapore offering satay bee hoon, ngoh hiang, satay, seafood, and prawn noodles. Prepare to be warm (like physically warm) and bring cash to pay for your transactions. If in doubt just join a stall with a long queue. Point to a picture of the food on the stall front if you don't know to describe it. Or ask a local! Don't worry if you don't speak Malay or Chinese. Most of the stall holders here speak good English.

This is one of the best food centres if you're looking for more traditional Singaporean style food. One of the specialities you'll find there is Kwah Teow, which are friend noodles, and the longest lines (always look for stalls with the longest lines; there's a reason why people line up) are at Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow. A very helpful gentleman behind me coached me through my order, and recommended I get the noodles "black" (you have a choice of black or white).With so many stalls, here, it's difficult to choose, but wander around until you find something you want, or looks good, and again, look for a long line.

I come here all the time after my climbing session (a 10 minute walk away at Onsight Climbing Gym). I'd recommend searching up online on which stalls to go for - it's a famous hawker centre but not everything is great, and not everything is always open. For traditional Chinese-style BBQ chicken wings (caramelised and sticky without a heaping amount of sauce, a squeeze of lime and a chicken rice-style chilli sauce - just the way we like it!), the stall with the name Chong Pang in it (2nd row) never fails. For delicious stir-fried flat rice noodles in soy sauce with cockles, some prawns and beansprouts, go for Lao Fu Zhi (also on the 2nd row). I personally like it done 'white' style, which is the Malaysian style and more savory, but Singaporeans go for the 'black' style, which is sweeter (not my favorite :(). For wanton noodles in soup, try Cho Kee (1st row), and you can never go wrong with Lao Ban beancurd (soy bean custard! It's like creme brulee without the caramel sugar top). Heaps to eat, plenty to explore, and for a taste of really local drinks, I go for sugarcane juice or lime juice - great for a super hot humid day

I spend a lot of time in Singapore, usually 3-months/year. So, I have tried most of the major food centers across the island. However, I was surprised myself that I did not try Old Airport. I made the journey using MRT to Dakota and it is not a long walk. However, I might have missed what makes this place so special. To me, I saw most of the same things I saw in other Hawker Centers, but with a bit less seating and more congestion. For me, Tiong Baruh (sp?) and Maxwell are far better. East Coast food center is amazing as is Newton, but of course tourist central. I even like West Coast Food Center a lot. it is surely possible I missed the great gems of old airport, but for me, it seemed to be more difficult to find a seat, less cleanly than others, and nothing super special for booths. Also, the location is a bit tricky compared to some of the other places. I give it an average
4
The Old Airport Road Food Centre is located along Old Airport Road about 200m from the Dakota MRT station on the circle line. The building has two storeys with level one for food stalls and level 2 for shops selling clothes, shoes and electrical goods.This food centre is under the jurisdiction of the National Environment Agency and is open throughout the year. The best Lor Mee stall is found here and it operates from 7.00 am to about 3.00 pm. You will find other stalls selling char kuay teow, peanut cakes, prawn noodles and some Malay stalls selling mee siam and mee rebus. The food here is good as most of the hawkers here have been selling their food for 3 generations. The price is cheap compared to those in the air con food courts in the shopping malls. Eating at hawkers' stall is a unique experience for tourists and the real authentic food is to be found here and not the 5-star hotels. If you want the local traditional food this is the best place and not the restaurants found in high end hotels
5
For us this is by far the best of Hawker Centers. Only just away from "not always cheap downtown". But quick and easy to get to by bus. Feels like the real deal. Big and spacious. Cool at night. Mix of all the ethnics of Singapore and their signature food dishes cooked in almost home kitchens for very reasonable prices. We had Singapore dishes but finished off with a great steak at Holly Grill #01-27 with mash and spud in foil. Hit the right spot! But we must also give mention to #01-14 Crystal. He is an ol' Rocker and plays his old music while you drink his ice cold beer. He cares about his beer. And sugar cane juice.
4
I like the the sugarcane juice and the seafood menu. the only thing is sometimes its hard to look for a clean available table.
5
This place has become my favourite place to eat. Where are many local foods here to explore. The prices are reasonable.
4
Alot of the stalls here are deemed as " famous"- the fried kway teow, wantan noodles etc".. The queue can be crazy for these famous stalls. Be prepared to wait.
4
A place where you can find a huge variety of local cuisine at a cheap price. No aircon . Everything that you want to eat, you can find it here.
5
All the local delicacies under 1 roof
Definitely a 1 dragon service, from breakfast to dinner food
Merlion is a must see, Old Airport Road food centre is a must makan!
5
One of popular place to get good foods, some are a bit price maybe die to popularity . Parking is quite OK but public's transport is easy within reach .
5
Foodie friends always recommend this food centre - you can't go wrong. There's a famous char kway teow here, always a long queue but worth the wait. Nothing here is below average. If you're in the vicinity, go for it!
3
It may be best to bring someone with local knowledge with you for this one. It's an experience!! A great variety of local dishes, at a very low price.It's an experience for those who want to see how the locals eat. There is a wide variety of food for everyone - you just need to know where to begin! Some of the smells and dishes can be off putting - so be brave.Beer was available with table service, which was lovely. We tried a variety of dishes, but didn't go too mad. The hygiene standards are good. For some reason, they don't provide paper (serviette or toilet roll). Packets of tissues can be bought from locals for change.
5
One of my favourite hawker centres in Singapore!If you're a tourist please avoid Newton food centre and Gluttons' Bay, those are tourist traps with subpar food.. I would say avoid Lau Pa Sat too. Old Airport Road Food Centre is much more authentic and has an amazing range of local hawker fare. The char kway teow is a must try
5
It might be hard to find a spot that sells beer after 10.30pm in Singapore. Most pubs and bars charge a premium price for a pint. If you're into just having a few casual drinks late night, it's good to come over. Most food stalls are still open up until 1 a.m. It's great for some late snacks accompanied by reasonably priced beer (SGD6 for a 700ml tiger bottle). Food is also cheap.Instead of grabbing muchies from the convenient stores, why not drop by for something straight out of the wok for a fraction of the price. Great place for the budget traveller
5
There are a few famous stalls in that hawker centre, for example the hokkien mee is very flavourful. I also like the kway chap there, long queue but worth the wait.
4
So much variety you will probably spend 20 minutes walking around wondering where to start. Must try the famous fried oyster omelette. Order the 3 in 1, with oyster, prawn and squid. Yummy!
5
I grew up in Singapore and this place has the real deal! There's enough food choices to satisfy all food cravings. If you love food and if you love Singapore food, you must go there!
5
I went to there almost daily when I was living in Singapore , I realised that chicken wings , soya bean ,fruit juice and fried oyster are the best , you must try when you are there !
4
If you love pork chop, chicken chop, lamp chop! Don't miss here! And also they hv nice satay mee Hun,
5
Many hawker centres in Singapore serve all the essential Singapore's favourite local delights but Old Airport Food Centre does it with finesse. It houses the best fried hokkien noodle and western food (chicken/pork chop with fries) and one of the best char kway teow and wanton noodle. My favourites include the herbal drink, Chinese style mutton soup, satay steamboat and made-to-order cheong fun with fillings (rice noodle roll) The crowd during meal times, esp in the weekends, is a indication of how good the food is
4
You can find almost any cuisine here. There are some stores that are more famous that others, and they usually only open either for lunch or dinner, not both, so do you research before you come. My favourite here is the albus prawn noodle, lucky char kuay teow
5
Most of the weekdays I eat my lunch in hawker centres, either alone or with friends. I have a few favourite ones but Old Airport Road one is The Favourite. I try to go once a week, even though I have to travel to the other side of the city. There is no bad or average food here. Everything ranges from good to excellent. My favourites - Big Prawn Noodle, Mutton Soup, Toa Payoh Rojak, Lor Mee, Nam Sing Hokkein Mee, Chee Cheong Fun, ... the list goes on. Best go for lunch. Dinner options are limited.
5
Love the food here always.... It's a must to go here when you're in singapore cause it the only place you get all in 1... For fried oyster omelette to carrot cake to duck rice to mince meat noodle to porridge to satay... It can go on !!!! You name it you can have it !!! FYI they close by 10-10.30 pm daily ... Stop at Dakota mrt.... It's closer !
4
Loved this place, which offered a great selection of SE. Asian Fayre. Very well presented, cooked and in terms of value fantastic as it is full of locals and not tourists like us. Our best meal in Singapore and worth a trip out from the centre to Dacota MRT if you want to fill your boots for not too many $SG. GO is my advic
3
the taste is average and not out of this world or something to shout about as I have tasted better fare elsewhere.
5
Big hawker center off the tourist path, easily accessible via MRT. We ate a variety of traditional hawker fare: kway teow, chicken rice, laksa.
5
Nam Sing Hokkien Mee, Rojak, Fried Kway Teow, Lor Mee, Kway Chap for breakfast or lunch. Chilli And Pepper Crab for dinner
5
This is our local hawker centre and we make regular use of it. It's huge! So far we have not been disappointed. You can pick up great tasting Asian/Singaporean food, sometimes for less than S$5 per person. Indoor and outdoor seating is available. What's not to like
5
You get a good variety of hawker food here. From the wanton noodles (Hua Kee Wanton noodles 01-02) to the rojak (a local salad with a shrimp paste sauce - from Toa Payoh Rojak) to the best fried prawn noodles (Nam Sing). You can also get western style meals (chicken chop, pork chop, pasta) to japanese cuisine (udon, tempura) all at reasonable prices
5
For a truly Singapore experience, you have to visit a hawker centre. A wide variety of food at decent pricing. You can tell which are the popular stalls. They have never ending long queues. Quench your thirst with a cold sugarcane juice while you wait for your food.
5
This is the authentic hawker place where most of the famous local delights can be found. Easily accessible by mrt to Dakota station. Plenty of rich high flyers come here for meals as well (many big cars at carpark) so you can guess how delicious the food is. There are a few seafood stalls with cheap and fresh crabs. This place is also known for their famous Wanton noodle, char kuey tiao, rojak, fried hokkien noodle, traditional teochew porridge and many more.
4
I had a great laksa here and some nice desserts. One of the stalls had a queue of people lining up for its Char Kwai Teow. I tried a bit of that too, and although I don't think it was anything extraordinary, indeed it too was tasty.There is a huge variety of food here, everything seems to be wrapped up by around 10pm and not all the stalls are open every day. I went on a Monday night and found there was still plenty of variety. Prices are good and this food centre was more, let's say, "authentic".... Hawkers didn't pester you with their menus as much as they do at Newton and the setup was more for pragmatism than comfort and elegance.Definitely give it a try, especially if you're staying in any of the Geylang hotels from where this place is walking distance
5
old airport road is about 10 mins drive from city hall using nicoll highway so it is very accessible. it is one of my favorite choice as the houses many good stalls representative of singapore local food. the char kuey tao located in the middle second row is delicious with a long queue. the fried egg with oysters located in the front row facing the road is also very tasty and comes with fat oysters. the wonton noodles also on the front row (there are two but i prefer the left) comes with springy noodles and sauce
5
Singapore's food centres are great levellers. There was a steady stream of all sorts of cars making its way into the area for Sunday lunch, including a bright red Ferrari parked with impunity and surrounded by double yellow lines.Great food. I had char sui pork and beautifully tender chicken wings while my husband had lor mee. This place is testament to the mantra that you should pick one thing and do it well. Each stall produced their speciality very well indeed. The best hawker centre we have been to in Singapore.
5
It's cheap, quick and easy local taste!! You can find a big variety of local food, drinks and desserts!! They are all lovely!! Highly recommended!!
4
I would like to recommend to all to come here. They have many varieties of good hawker food at reasonable prices. My usual place for dinner.
4
We were there for brunch on our Jubilee National Day celebration before we proceed to Sport Hub for further celebration.
We tried the Whitley Prawn Noodle stall.
The gravy and prawn were fresh and delicious.
Worth the queing time of 30 mins.
5
You can get a real feel for Asian food here. The variety is amazing. The service is excellent. The choice is dazzling. Very reasonable prices. The smells and the sounds delight the senses.
A real must visit if you are in the area.
5
OAR is the best hawker centre I've visited in Singapore. Wide variety on food all day and more frequented by regular people than e.g. Maxwell food centre.
4
Prawn noodles, chili crab, char kway teow and so on, best of all is still the fired hokkien mee there (you had to wait for at less 45mins for the meal), for transport wise you got a few option there e.g. bus, taxi and mrt
4
Today, when there are more and more chain operated food courts and hawker centres, it's nice to find individual stalls, and so many of them in one place. Here are around 165 stalls selling a wide range of local food. And the place is easy to reach as it is next to Dakota MRT
4
~Lunch with colleagues who'd surprised I'd never been to OAR (I'd not), brought me to a HDB Hawker Centre, nothing like Adam Road, Serangoon Gardens or Newton Circus which are filled with BBQ Grill stalls. Old Airport Road at a glance is the real thing, when you compare air-conditioned Food Court fare which is mass produced at some factory and cooked to order on the spot, this place looks to be folks who prep daily the old way from 3am onwards...~Encouraged I walked the stalls to find many long queues, each block on the left and right had at least one long "queue" = Singapore for must be good food!~I selected a stalls which is normal for locals to have breakfast and the curry puff stall...both without queues (I'm not your typical Singaporean)~Wang Wang Crispy Curry Puff is indeed Freshly Made, I can see the uncle furiously kneading and pull them one by one and the display case had only a few of the 4 flavors they sell, I ordered one of each~The Yam puff was a smooth chunk of beautifully wrapped wonder YUMz, Black Pepper had too many pieces of chicken with hot piping gravy it was hard to eat, Sardine was a difference with a well mixed curry YUMz & their Curry Puff killed YUMz. Bottomline you will not find large chunks of potato fillings inside their delicate exterior... definitely worth a takeout!~Zhong Zhong Wu Xiang (Five Spices) Xia Bing was filled to the brim with "Ngoh Hiang" all ready for takeout, the incredible difference was the labelling had both English & Chinese wordings... not a normal thing... and it dawned on me that many food stall owners expect their patrons to know exactly what's inside their prawn fritters instead of having to explain much less label them! I ordered a few and with it the customary chili sauce plus beehoon~Every fritter is delicious, no doubt an amazing range of well spiced "Ngoh Hiang" for the faint hearted, this is a good way to start on local food :)~Take a look at the photos to view the sumptuous yummy foods~So many more stalls to explore... will be back, ample open air and multi-storey parking available just behind 51 Old Airport Road with a fuss free UI gantry, this is just a drive away :

A very old hawker centre that has been refurbished to cater to its patrons comfort. cuisine ate offered here.You have the Malay row that offers Malay dishes as cheap as S$3.50 for beef rendang and 1 vegetable yes $3.50 and it is very delicious as the rendang is very soft and the rendang gravy has seeped into its meat. Tq mak chik, aunty in Malay as a respect to our different races.The Indian row offer mee goreng to goreng nasi to prata to Briyani. There is a Muslim Indian Briyani that price it @$3 and is sold out by 3 pm, its mutton choice is a hot sell so come early not to miss it.The Chinese stalls offer majority of the hawker fare here from the infamous Rochor canal prawn noodle that price as much as S$8 for big prawns with pork pieces. Sprinkle the chilli powder for a better taste and eat it with cut chilli you will want more of it. .... This is our local version of ramen at a cheaper price and it is introduced by the Hokkien dialet group. The long queue of patient followings of Ryochi stewed pork and intestines has no denial as you see patrons awaiting patiently for their order to be placed. The owner is Teochew dialect by origin and you must be prepared to pay minimum S$22 as his innards are boiled for hours to its soft crunchy perfection. It's pork knuckles are firm and yet soft with collagen and juicy meat. Not forgetting my Lau Pasat Rojak which is fresh and cheaper than the infamous Toa Payoh stall as the cucumber and turnip gets smaller and smaller when the elderly woman takes charge, the queue is long and it is not money for value if you don't get enough. Lots desserts stalls and fruit juices to sugarcane to soya bean drink stalls to complement your meal.You will mingle with the locals and experience the good eating spree with great satisfaction
4
So Many food stall can find in this food centre, like Chee Cheong Fun, Kway Chap, Hokkien Mee, Char Kuey Tiao, Western food, Soya Beancurd and so on.....The price is cheap and the taste is very very good!!!!The food centre is near Dakota MRT station, so very easy to go!
5
They have everything! And the best prawn noodle soup is here!!! "Albert Street Prawn Noodles" stall #10 at Old Airport Road Hawker Center. It is also next to a fresh market and a FairPrice market. MUST TRY!!!
5
If you are looking many things to eat at one go - sharing all the different food with your family or friends, this is the place to go! Awesome fried black noodles, grilled chicken wings and satay, rojak! Many more to mention. A must to experience on your own!
5
Prawn noodles, chili crab, char kway teow, satay, duck rice, chicken rice, etc. Think of any traditional Singaporean hawker food and you will find a stall in this hawker center. It is conveniently located near the Circle Line (Dakota or Mountbatten MRT Exits) and local food is superb! I consider this center better than Newton, Maxwell, and Holland Village
5
This is a huge hawker, hence you can find all sorts of local food. Suitable for visitors to Singapore wanting to try our local delights. Prices here are also reasonable and mostly printed on their signages. Personally, I think this place would be better than Newton food centre for trying local food.
4
Came here solo around 8pm in weekdays. Half of the stall already closed but some of the best still open (hokkien prawn noodle, oyster egg, char oyster kwe tiau, chickeng wings, etc). This is the type where local goes to eat. No need to dress up, just dress down and go there. Prepare to queue as some of the famous stall has long queue. But worth the taste! Believe me.For first timer - i would suggest to bring your own tissue and wet tissue too. And have a look around first before you order. Too many good option it confused me. Nearest MRT is dakota (yellow line) only less than 5mins walk.Highly recommended!!!especially the hokkien prawn noodle
5
It is true that most of the Hawkers Centre offer similar food, but sometimes, you might find a hidden gem that only the locals will know about. Special mention: Lao Fu Zi for their Fried Kway Teow and Lau Ban Dou Hua for their almond flavor beancurd.The Fried Kway Teow was full of flavours and heat from its wok. The noodles were really tasty, the sauce was just right, not too salty and not too sweet. The Almond Flavour bean curd is surely one of the best bean curd I have ever tasted. Different from Cantonese bean curd (which I am used to), this bean curd is quite solid, more like egg-white pudding. And the subtle almond flavour is really refreshing, especially after a few other fried dishes. The perfect dessert to end the day
5
Just love this place, we went there several times and every time we would try something else out. It's the spot to go to for locals and tourists because of the quality and of the variety. Try the squid, the chicken wings, carrot cake, chili crab, oh just try as much as you can and follow the queue, that's usually how you know which stand has a really good dish. Can't wait to go back to Singapor
3
I was a bit disappointed by this hawker market. I had spent the day in little India (my favourite hawker market of them all) and thought I'd have a late dinner so traveled to the old airport road. The guides books don't say any times but give the impression food goes all hours. It's not true. At 10pm all the stalls were closed but a few left open, so I had a bit to eat and left. Not the choice I wanted. I found in the end all hawker markets started to shut down before 9pm
4
We found the hawker centre to be a lot dirtier than many others that we have visited in Singapore but nonetheless the food was excellent and the range was extensive. Although it was peak weekday lunch period, it wasn't crowded and several stalls were closed. I would definitely eat here again but probably wouldn't go out of my way to do so. Prices are the same as others (cheap!
4
I just came here to eat Chili Crab in Mattar Road Seafood. I got 1 portion medium crab (actually it was so large) with chili sauce. It was really good. one portion for 2 pax. It was more than enough. You can eat it with rice or
4
This is it. Singapore in a nutshell. They have a complete variety of all sorts of food you're looking for. Why travel far when you have it all at a neighborhood food center?
4
We went there for the experience. I ordered prawn noodles while hubby got the pork ribs noodles from Albert's Noodles (not sure if I got the name right) and it did not disappoint. The food was really good.
5
This place had great food, great prices, and if you sit out over-looking the road there was a lovely breeze as well. We ate their 8 times and I had a different meal every time, wonderful, wonderful stuff.
5
Thise place offers a wide range of choices and all are so cheap. Been here for like 5x and i can come back over and over again without getting bored of the food.
4
Though quality of some stalls have dipped, its still one of the better hawker centres to go for food. Many popular stalls that locals go to are still there, like the Fried Kway Tiao, Fried Oyster, Lor Mee, Steam Fish, Traditional Cookie stall, rojak stall, prawn mee stall, wanton mee stall and claypot stall are still the same cooks. A recommended place for both locals and tourists
4
Crowded with locals my native friend took me here to try various items on my food list. Difficult to negotiate if you don't speak Chinese but the food was plentiful and cheap nothing earth shattering and likely not healthy. But I would go back. Tip. Bring your own toilet paper as they do not exist in these stalls.
2
Used to love this place but even the locals seem to be deserting it. Not busy during evening dinner hour last sat. (Feb 14). Food quality down and prices up. I don't think it's worth the hike out there anymore. If you want that suburban all Singapore experience try Serangoon Gardens Food Center (Chomp Chomp)
5
Well worth the taxi drive into the Suburbs to find a local haunt, not frequented by tourists and selling great food at local prices.We had been to the Mud Crab specialists stall on past visits and this occasion was as memorable as those previous. The Chilli Mud crab and the White pepper mud crab were cooked to perfection. The Beer is available ice chilled from a stall just a hop skip away and it is all consumed at the benches with the locals. You cannot get a better Singapore dining experience, IMHO
5
It a must try for this hawker that is located near to Mountbatten MRT and walking distance to this hawker. There are too many nice food in this hawker, cha kway tiao, fried carrot cake, satay, bbq chicken wing, soya bean curd......etc. Too many to mention, highly recommended if you are look for great hawker food
3
The food centre/ court has a good variety of food/ drinks. Would be good if you have few people to share more dishes. Location: taxi at SGN10 (one way) to get there from City Halls areasFood quality: Not bad; but you have to like the local style to enjoy. Sitting: lots of sitting in both outdoor/ indoor. Took outdoor, which is more chill. Drinks are served at the table if you take outdoor seats.
4
u can find all singapore local food in a price of hawker center but come with five star taste.... quite far from city but highly recommended for tourist want to experience high quality singapore local food.... die die must go.......
4
Great food and cheap (except for the chili crab). If visiting singapore I think it's a must see if local street food is on the agenda. An nice cold tiger beer is a nice "pairing" with almost any dish.
4
We decided to take the train here and it is a short walk from the station, there was so much to choose from and everything we had was very tasty. Well worth the visit.
5
I have been to a lot of food centers and this place is one of those great places. Nicely located and the variety of food they offer are so awesome.
5
Ah, I love paying next to nothing for delicious local food. The centre isn't close to the centre of town but is super easy to get to by metro. Go after 11am as before then lots of the stalls are closed. You will not be disappointed. If you're not going solo don't get the same meal so you can try more dishes & share instead
4
I have been to this hawker center for the last decades and still loves it. It has grown over the years to be now considered an authentic hawker center serving local food We were there this morning and had our otah, nasi lemak, kopi, friend carrot cake, wantan noodles,, kua chap. Every single one was done the way it should have been...The many different stores in the hawker center gives food lovers a great selection. At local prices, old airport hawker center is the gem for quality food at inexpensive prices. A wonderful night out to be with friends,, colleagues or family
5
This non-air conditioned Food Centre is arguably the best in Singapore, with the Chinatown Complex and the Maxwell Food Centre coming in second and third respectively.There is a wide variety of local street food at very reasonable prices, and an excellent place for even tourists to taste the local food.Top on my list is the fried rice noodles, fried hokkien noodles, the Rojak, satay, Fishball soup and noodles, Pig Organs & Offals , Oyster OmeletteChicken Rice, Beef Noodles, Bean Curd desserts, local desserts, local fruits & juices, and more.But be prepared to sweat it out, especially on hot days, and during the peak lunch hours
5
Having missed a visit to Old Airport FC on my previous visits to Singapore, I made sure not to miss it again.Although I was staying in the Clarke Quay area, you can easily reach OAFC by MRT (only a short walk from the station).Boy was I glad I came here. All my favourite dishes were done so well. Kway Teow (Lao Fu Zi) and Satay (churn Kee and Fatman's) were delicious. The prawn noodles (with pork ribs) from Albert Street Noodles were also outstanding, plus I had one of the best Hor Funs ever!This place is a genuine suburban food hangout with terrific atmosphere, plenty of seating and a relaxed vibe.I came back two more times. Eat, drink and be merry
4
It is a better hawker centre in the day than at night. Most of the more popular stalls are actually closed at night.As in most hawker centers in Singapore, you bring with you some patience and join any stall that has a line, that will be your best bet.My personal favorites:- Nan xing Hokkien fried noodles (because they do the version that I prefer that has more bee Hoon than yellow noodles)- peanut pancake- kway chap- carrot cake/oyster omelette stall facing the front entranc
4
We went several hawker food centers during our trip, and the Old Airport Rd Food Center offered the best variety and taste. The Fish ball soup and Noodles is one of the best in SG as recommended by our guide and the primary reason we went far the vicinity of our hotel. When we arrive, there is a long queue of locals to the said stall. We also went to try other food items such as Bean Curd and Desserts - Kachang which we also enjoyed. Everything that we tried in this place never failed to satisfy our expectation of good food yet great value unlike the other food centers which do not consistently deliver. Its just sad that we have limited time to explore the stalls for there is still a lot to uncover. I will definitely come back here in my next visit
4
This is one of the places I've loved eating. The dumplings are amazing. The crab is pretty good too, but one of my favourite dumpling places so far.
4
This place serve great tasty fresh pepper crab and the price is very reasonable. However, it wasn't the best dining experience in a hot and stuffy food court with a lot of people waiting for you to finish quickly.
4
My usual stall there is Fatman Satay. I travel from west to eat for this satay. Lean meat n nice satay sauce.
2nd fav stall is the stalls selling otah there.
3rd is the prawn mee facing main road. Near famous wanton mee.
4
I was driven to this food centre by my local friends, and man, I was not disappointed. I saw less of the tourist-kind like me, and it was not teeming with people like the other hawker centres, considering it was Saturday night. I don't know if it was some kind of off-beat place but the food was good and plentiful- definitely reasonable. I paid significantly more for similar quality in China Town- that also in 'crampy' places. I bought all my Chinese/ Malay items for S$ 4 or less with sugarcane juice extra. And, yes, I found most stalls keeping themselves open quite late, say 10:30PM plus

I was taken to this incredible place by my Singaporean colleague. He said it was the best hawker center in Singapore and I now see why he believes it. The Hokkien Mee with prawn and other meats was great.I also had the prawn noodles and was floored by the flavors in the broth and the size and perfect cooking of the prawns. The S$10 bowl was way too big for me but somehow I finished it.I also was treated to the sugar cane drink that is mildly sweet and much less sugary than I expected. It is perfect for dealing with the heat of Singapore and of the food.Have the bean curd dessert -- it will melt in your mouth and taste much like a not so sweet flan. So much food for such a great price.I was in Singapore for 4 days and ate at 3 hawker centers. This was far and away the best one. Next time I'm trying the stingray
4
Foods are famous and nice, worth to buy their food is a bit expensive then normal hawker centre but still good to buy because is very nice foods. Price are below $10 but above $5. Normal hawker centre food usually are below $5.Recommend should try all the food stall is popular due to their food taste and nice , alots of people like to come here and eat. Although is hot during afternoon best can come either in the morning or night
2
Yes it's a famous hawker center .No it's not the best in SG, far from it. And definitely not worth coming there from far . In fact, you'll hardly find any healthy stall there : it's mostly deep fried food. I really wonder what's the magic about deep frying ???There are much better local places especially in the geylang area.Look for alternatives!!
5
On the advise of a comfort cab driver I convinced my 2 other friends and it was excellent especially the Srilakan crab compared to some other places it's cheaper. My friends were happy on my suggested place.It's just a hawker centre so do have high expectations of a modern day ac food court. Must try the chilli crab

It may be a tad hard to get to, but you will be spoilt for choices here as there are so many food stalls around. I have only come for dinners, so can't really comment on the lunch situation. The place is popular and still draw crowd, locals and tourists alike, during meal time.I have had the prawn mee, rojak, wonton mee and char kwaytiaw here, and all were satisfactory. The food was delicious, the prices are reasonable and service was prompt (although you will need to queue a bit at popular stalls). You don't come here for ambiance, as there is none. It is after all a hawker center; it can be hot, crowded, noisy, but that's part of the fun. Aside for the long queue at favorite stalls, you may find it hard to find a seat during meal time. Bring along a pack of tissue paper and put it at any empty table to mark that it is taken. This is a Singaporean way of doing it and people do respect it. You may need to share a table with complete strangers too, and this is also a norm
3
Huge variety of local selection. After a good 20 minutes wait for my wanton noodle, I felt that the standard have fallen as compared to the past. However, this place still draws huge crowd during lunch hour and parking can be a headache. With so many choice of food available, I will still return again. Hopefully the other food like will not disappoint me when I return
4
The wanton mee, hokkien fried mee, holy grill western food and chicken cutlet curry rice are fantastic.
Reasonable price and wonderful local food
5
This is one hawker/food centre that boats a number of good food stalls. There is a wide variety of selection. Go during weekdays to avoid the crowds. It is one of the most accessible hawker centres beside dakota mrt station.
4
This place is out of the way with not many nearby places of interest unless you are heading to the Singapore Indoor Stadium (10-15 mins walk away).
3
I have been coming to this hawker centre for many years. And over the years, the standard of the food has deteriorated from mediocre to bad....The famous Hokkien Mee is soggy and bland.The two famous Wanton mee stalls are boring and so lacking in flavour.The hokkien tze chars are totally disappointing.The famous black pepper crab is over priced.The only saving grace here is the Toa Payoh Rojak, th
5
The Old Airport Road Food Center is a local Singaporean secret. Located away from the main tourist center, it is a place frequented by residents of the nearby housing units. They have the best selection of local hawker food I have come across in Singapore, and the quality you get for the price you pay is unbelievable. i will always come back to this place each time I visit Singapore
5
This is one of the best food centres to taste yummy local delights. My recommendations are (in order of greediness): 1) Toa Payoh Rojak2) Mattar Road Seafood (chilli crabs and white pepper crabs)3) Chuan Kee Satay4) Ming Kee Fuzhou Fish Balls5) Nam Sing Hokkien Mee6) Lao Fu Zhi Char Kway Teow 7) Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee8) Katong Ah Soon Fried OysterLastly, finish your meal with a traditional herbal drink at Ng Tong Shan Herbal Tea, burp! :
5
Fellow Singaporean here. Old Airport Road is host to many of the best hawker food in Singapore. I am writing this review to inform would be travellers that unfortunately this Hawker centre is closed for renovation til the 1st of July as i found out to my misfortune when i was denied my gastronomy cravings upon being confronted with a closed hawker centre last week. Should you still be around til 1st July,Be sure to eat the famous Char Kway Teow(though arguably the Golden mile CKY is still better) and the wanton mee which is served in different manners by 3 different competing stalls in the same lane
5
When you stepped in, you will say OMG..... Becoz so many stalls selling food.. All localicious.... Almost every stall has a beeline Q ... BBQ Chicken Wings, Rojak, Wan Ton Mee, Famous Char Kway Teow. Western Food, all types of noodles. Yummy each one.. Busy morning, noon, and night. A must try hawker center.
5
My girlfriend used to live there so whenever I visited her, we would have a meal at the food centre.If you are craving for local food, this is the place to come. They are lots of delicious food at an inexpensive price.It is situated near Mountbatten MRT Station (Circle line)It is a must visit place when you are in Singapore
5
A meal or several at a Singapore hawker centre is a must-do experience, and this is a great example of one. I come here primarily for the black pepper crab at Changi Seafood but everything is available, with an ice cold beer to wash it down
4
I think mainly locals frequent this food place. Find the longest line and you have found the best food. The chili crab was delicious and very messy. Have a sense of adventure and on't let the chaos of the place discourage you
5
We usually frequent Maxwell Road food centre, but Old airport road offers more variety in my opinion. Try the braised beef noodles. Located close to Dakota MRT. Next time we will try some further from the city centre.
4
Singaporean friends took us here for some good quality seafood.
Great chilli crab and more.
Great value, packed with locals, not touristy.
5
Best place to eat in Singapore. This hawker centre has everything you want to eat in this country and it's located near Dakota MRT station. Chicken rice, chilli crabs, satay and more......
2
a gd place to go for local food as variety is expansive.
But food can sometimes be inconsistent in some stalls especially during peak hours.
N ventilation needs major improving.
4
This is a little out of the city centre but still easily accessible by 2 MRT stations (Mountbatten or Dakota), so is a worthwhile venture out even for non-locals. If you are game to rough it a little to try eating Singapore-style, then head to Old Airport Road Food Centre. Be adventurous and just order a whole bunch of dishes to share and try with a group of friends.For more on the food centre you can read my blog post at:untouristsingapore.wordpress.com/2014/03/28/old-airport-road-food-centre-an-institution-
5
we went their twice must recently and have to admit the food was amazingly great - we had stingray, chili crab, seafood noodles, Chinese dumplings, mussels in dark chili sauce (you do have to suck them out of the shell) and lot more. pretty authentic atmosphere and really budget dinner
4
This food centre is mostly visited by locals as it is not conveniently located near any tourist spot. Having said that, the quality is good and isn't overpriced. There are a few good ones, but I forget the names. Just join any long queues, and you are likely getting good food
5
now is 2014 & the food here is still priced as affordable as ever so go ahead & order as much as your appetite can feed you with coz not only does this place attract the OLD TIMERS, even first time visitors will be amazed by the wide variety that this place offers & best of all? many stalls are serving THE SAME DISH...so choose wisely!!
5
We met some Singaporean college students at our hostel in Jakarta and they recommended this place along with some dishes to try. We went on New Year's Day around 1 PM. Easy busy from our hostel in Chinatown (Google Maps works very well, just like the locals said it would). We also took the #7 bus from there right to the Botanical Gardens, too. Nice way to really see the city and your Tourist Pass works.The guys gave us dishes to try, but our philosophy was just to stand in line at all the places that had a big queue. We had wonton noodles, two different spring rolls and another fried noodle and beef dish whose name is eluding me. All were EXCELLENT in price (3-5 SGD each) and quality.Definitely worth the visit
4
I'd like to recommend the stall Yummy Thai! (close every monday) Very authentic thai food, my fav dishes are Tom Yum soup, Seafood salad, Pineapple rice and Basil leave rice! YUMMY MAX!!!
5
We paid S$25 for the famous Singapore Chili Crab, it is around 600php. It was really great! And it is already for two persons. We also had their sugar cane juice with lemon for S$1.50.
4
Many food choices in this hawker centre. There are so many good food in this place, and all at affordable prices. This is definitely a place to try out Singapore's famous hawker food!
5
You can't go wrong at this food court. There are around 200 stalls selling all kinds of food. If you cannot decide which stall to choose, just go with the one with a queue of 3 or more. Almost everything is good here. Take the MRT and alight at Dakota and exit at Jalan Satu. Continue walking towards Cassia Link, which is just next to the food court
4
Have been here for many times. THe carrot cake, hokkien mee, fried kuay tiao, prawn mee is very good. The only problem, as usual, is the parking. But again, where else where good food is present that there is no parking issue?? The price is reasonable!
4
Have been here a couple of times since it is so close to my work place. The food is great. This place is great for the Toa Payoh Rojak. Have noticed a lot of demand for this shop and have tried it on both visits. I have tried the hokkien mee which was nice. The second time I tried the fish bee noon and it was very good too. The popiah is also good. Overall, this place has a lot of choices and you would not be disappointed if you try one of these popular food stalls
5
If you are looking for the best local hawker centre Old Airport Road has got to be it. After recommendations from Singaporean friends and research online we trekked to Dakota MRT stop after a long day at Sentosa, it was well worth it. Must tries are Mattar Road BBQ Seafood and 51 Soya Bean - which has the silkiest Tau Foo Fah I've ever had. The oyster omelette at stall 54 is also a must try - one of my favourite dishes on our trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand
4
Loved going to the various food centres (Hawkers Markets). Find a table and wander around to pick and choose what you fancy from the various stalls/shops.Satay from one, curry from another, fish from somewhere else - there is something for all with the traders being so friendly and trusting. Everything is freshly made and brought to you when ready, so it means just sit down and eat things when they come.Love love loved it
5
Here's the place for the widest spread of good hawker food in Singapore. The prawn noodles, the beancurd ( desserts), the durian puff, the famous chinese satay, the chinese herbal mutton soup, the famous soursop drink stall, the fried kway tiao, fried dough and bananas, seafood, crocodile meat soup etc. It is also my child's buffet place- she has her choice of western food, cupcakes, milkshake and satay all within the hawker. Remember to get seat before you get your orders and food from the hawkers. It is jam packed on Thursday and Friday evening. Nearest MRT is Mountbatten MRT
5
This hawker centre, unlike most other hawker centres, is bright and airy. The array of food is amazing, serving a different spread in the day and at night. Top favourites of mine here include the famous Nam Sing Hokkien Mee, the Blanco Court Kway Chup and the Wanton Noodles from the stall with the pink signage.There are also good satay, good local-western food, prawn noodles, zhi char here.Definitely a food paradise
5
Disappearing food scene in Singapore. Can try many local delights at affordable price. Try the bean curd, fried Kway Teow, prawn noodles, vegetarian food and many more. Great place to try out hawker food. Parking may be a problem during peak hours.
5
Will strongly recommend the following:
- Western Barbeque (Chicken Cutlet with Garlic Sauce)
- Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wanton Mee (Dumpling Noodles)
- Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee (Braised Noodles)
5
This food centre is good sized. After walking around I followed a steady line to this Won Ton Mee stall. Excellent. Great vibe. And a great way to see the way people in this city eat. Loved it.
4
Otah-otah was excellent from at least two of the stores. Non-spicy is available and still yummy. Rojak wasn't as special as the reviews said, same with the char kway teoh. Not all stalls are open for lunch so we couldn't try everything we wanted.
4
The wide varierty of local food from chaw kuey tiao to bbq chicken and satay and the famous chill soft lao ban beancurd. The place to go to for an empty stomach. You will be spolit for choice and price is affordable to all.
4
It's a big food center with over 200 stalls ...and you can find almost any local dishes here ..prices a very affordable ...ease of parking too
3
Located in a residenatial area, its an old school food court and only locals would know it. I was recommended to this area by some local friends as they had some famous hawker stalls which originated from there1) Prawn Mee/Noodles - there are a few stalls selling this here but the one I tried and like is the stall on the left the moment you enter the main building. If you are standing facing the food court the stall in on the 1st row left hand side. Can't remember the name2) Next to the stall is a sugar cane stall selling sugar cane drinks. Try the sugar cane drinks with "asam boi"...quite refreshing3) There is a famous Tau huay/soya bean stall in this food court which now has expanded to around 10 outlets in Singapore.....Try this....Do becareful as there are quite a number of stalls selling the same stuff...Do look for the famous one but becareful to queue as sometimes the queue can be quite long. This famous stall is located on the 2nd row (on the right side) behind the 1st row4) The Won Ton Mee & Satay here are also not bad. However I can't remember which stall
5
We went here for an early dinner and were totally delighted with what we found. Proper, tasty and reasonably priced food. Choose from 70+ separate stalls that each specialise in 2-3 delicious dishes. Select some from each and they will bring them to your table. We had golden bbq chicken wings (ooh yeah!), seafood noodles, chicken satay skewers with heavenly satay sauce and snow fungus drink(!) Cold beers and a superb range of desserts are there too. I'll be back
4
As a local, I love to come here for its variety of good food in a cluster. We got the wanton mee here which you must take a number and wait your turn, Ruji fishball noodles which have ridiculously fresh and bouncy fishballs. Oysters omelette. Prawn noodles, duck and kway chap(only in the day). bbq chicken wings. Satay. Almost all local delicacies at a low cost. Self service
4
As I stay in Katong, this hawker centre is one of my favorite. I particularly enjoy the 'lor mee', primarily thick flat yellow noodles covered by thick starchy gravy, with chunky fish meat, bean sprouts, egg, yummy vinegar & garlic, which cost at least S$4.00. Any less (say $3.00), you will get the same-size bowl of noodles without the fish meat. Unless you go early, be prepared to join a long queue. The stall typically finishes its stock by lunch time. Highly recommended
5
So much variety and good food. Best hawker centee in Singapore. Prices are also reasonable but it can get too crowded and getting food from some stalls take a long time due to the long queues.
5
We had dessert (Tofu fa) there. Very sweet and smooth! We can experience what locals eat! Very cheap prices with reasonable portion. People are happy and nice there. Lots of choices of local food!
4
Love it. Try their Lor Mee (usually sold out before noon), Oyster Ommelette (pronounced as Or Jian), Hokkien Mee, Satay, Char Kway Teow, Soya Bean Milk and Beancurd. Think these are my favourites whenever I visit.
5
Excellent good food, some of the best in Singapore are located here and you won't need to worry about the prices... split for choice but do come for early lunch as it's pack by 12noon daily and most good store close after lunch
4
Famous for Lor Mee, Kway Zam, BBQ seafood, fried kway teow, wantan mee etcb
my favorite food hunt location during weekends
5
I've lived in Katong all my life, and Old Airport Road hawker centre must rank as one of the best in Singapore, comparable to Hong Lim and Bedok. All these have many "famous" hawkers who each have won multiple accolades.I used to think the Toa Payoh rojak here was no big deal, especially with a 1/2hr wait. But he has a queue system (take a number and there's an electronic number that tells you it's your turn). So have your regular meal, and near the end, you can finish off your meal with rojak. But I just tried it today, and I think it has grown on me, and I like the sticky peanut sauce very much.I also had the century egg porridge, where they give you a single piece of you tiao. No don't ask for another piece. Want to buy they also don't want to sell you. Goes well with the raw fish, though quality of fish could be better. But very generous helpings of century egg and the porridge is very smooth.There's also - Lao fu Zi fried char Kwan Teow, that's placed on brown banana leaves- grilled chicken wings- soursop juice- lor Mee (that has an incredibly long queue)- lor Mee (tiong bahru, which is 'less' famous so has a slightly shorter queue)- sliced fish soup- prawn meSorry, can't remember the unit numbers. I can visualize where they are only :

For an authentic food experience, visit the Old Airport Rd Food Centre. We ate a number of dishes, from a number of stalls and loved every dish - plus the value is amazing!!Our biggest dish was a kg of chilli crab from Mattar Road Seafood Bbq - the crab was perfectly cooked and the sauce was spicy (but didn't blow your head off) with a good mix of egg and tomato. I would recommend this stall for chilli crab to anyone who visits this food centre. We arrived about 7:30pm and there was already about 10 orders in front of us - but it gave us time to taste other dishes at stalls nearby. The crab was $30SGD for 1kg - which is amazing value, especially for us coming from the AUD.We tried the chicken wings nearby - as recommended by a local who befriended us - they were a great snack to get our appetite ready for the crab! We also tried some dumplings from a stall nearby (can't recall the name unfortunately!), which were $5SGD for 10 pan fried pork dumpling. We also had a few glasses of sugar cane juice and a few tigers.This is the place to visit if you want authentic Singaporean food
5
We were taken here as a treat by friends and boy was it an experience! So many wonderful flavours and smells. Just awesome. Ended up eating Singapore crab, satays of various meats, yong tofu, oysters in an omelette, parsnip cake, grilled stingray... And oh did my belly take a pounding but so so so worth it! The food was AH-MAY-ZING!
3
Cheap is cheap, no question. But on the quality of the food I have some reservations.The food center is located in an area away from any attraction. I was there for business, but this is not a place where I would recommend a detour to get there. It has a good variety of stalls and offerings, larger than other food centers I visited. The quality though is very inconsistent and you will probably benefit by a going there with a local you trust. On the positive side prices do not go up by just clearly being a tourist, as it can happen in other foodcourts. I tried a couple of different stalls apparently estimated by locals. But the quality was barely sufficient.I would consider this if traveling on a very tight budget. Not for trying new food experience
5
It's almost as if all the best street hawkers consolidated in this fairly huge and under-rated hawker centre. I love the lor mee and cheong fun (steam rice noodle) made fresh and only when ordered, the come with filling of your choice (Prawn, char siew, scallops and chinese mushrooms). Simply delicious!
4
Long queues on weekends with difficulty in finding parking spaces. Lots of good and famous food stalls to fill you and friends empty stomachs.My fav is Lao Fu Zi CWT and rojak.
5
Great variety, great quality, great prices. This is local food for locals at its best. It is also the home of the best soya beancurd that has now become common throughout Singapore.
5
Hi Everyone,As a local living in this estate, this is one of the place I would like to recommend visitors coming to Singapore.Its not one of those place they will bring you on a package tour.However if its good local food at great prices you are looking for, I give this place a thumbs up.Its a great place to taste all the local food underone roof.Moreover its very accessible by train
4
The place is quite big but can get very crowded. Lots of nice food available and can see long queues at some popular stalls. It can get a bit too warm especially in Singapore's weather but the food did more than enough to compensate for the discomfort, if any
4
prices are the best and most economical here. Portions are huge as well, here are my reccomendations.1.) Kallang Western BBQ - $5 and up- Try chicken cutlet with garlic sauce or Fish and Chips- Portion usually pretty big- Unfriendly lady boss at peak hours but worth the tolerance2.) Fu Dao Satay (Facing Broadrick Secondary and Main Road)-Black pepper satay and normal satay at 50Cents a piece-Very good peanut sauce, satay chunk generous as well- Operating days is a little irregular3.) Lor Mee- Opens during daytime only- Long queue-Uses garoupa as condiments (bones removed)- 4 bucks and upAvoid the herbal tea at the kallang western bbq row. complete ripoff, charges 3-5bucks for ordinary herbal beverages when you can get at establish medical hall for half the price
4
I had the wanton noodle with dumplings, big prawn noodles, barbecue chicken wings and guava fruit juice. They all were very good. It is very easy to find. Alight at Dakota MRT station and it's less than 3 minutes walk from there. I saw many people eating the chili crabs and fried kuey teow. They looked yummy too. Especially the Lao Fu Tzi fried kuey teow, there was a long Que more than 20 people waiting to order. Next time I must try this..
5
Lots of food stalls to choose from! Heaps of Singaporean dishes, we were spoiled for choice. We were not sure what to pick, decided to just look at what the locals were having and decided from there. Food was really good and I loved the fruit juices that were freshly squeezed! It is a hawker centre so no air-conditioning. Recommended
5
We headed here as soon as we had the chance. The highlight was the 'wagyu' beef noodle soup and Thai food from nearbye stalls. The owner of the noodle shop came over to us afterwards to ask know we liked his food. It proved an excellent counter foil to overly expensive restaurants that pass off mediocre food in places like Clarke Quay.Don't bring your fastidious friends! Just the ones who enjoy seeing how good food can be eaten cheaply in Singapore.Take a taxi there as there is not too much to see on the Old Airport rd
5
I have been to most of the most famous hawker centers in Singapore the month we stayed there - paying my respects as a foreign foodie to that wonderful Singaporean tradition. Well, this one is the best foodwise. From the noodles to the bean curd and from the satay to Aunty's coconut pancakes, this was the best hawker meal we had in about a month of food discoveries in this wonderful city. We have done our research and I am sure you'll do yours and you'll find out about all the famous stands but stay assured that this place can surprise you with a lot more - just keep the the usual tourist foodie tradition of "follow the queue". Whenever you see a long queue there is a good to excellent reason says the international law of street food and Singapore is no exception
5
Famous, a great choice with many stalls and very popular with locals. All the taxi drivers have breakfast here so that should tell you its good. But not so many expats have discovered this place, which is fine with me. The less of us that know about it the better ;-
4
Very good food selection at very reasonable price.
5
Had local and western food at reasonable prices. Food was delicious. also had vegetarian for non meat eaters.
4
Yoiu gotta take your time to find out what's good and what's not so good in this massive, crowded hawker centre.
3
Just wish we could eat in peace withour peddlers of all sorts coming to bug you.
4
Most of stall in the food center are famous. Price are reasonable.
4
If you are a tourist looking for really good local food, this is one of the many hawker centres around. Dont expect the same atmosphere or service as in a restaurant or even an airconditioned food court in a shopping mall. Thats part of the fun for the hundreds of people eating out here everyday, and here we find local food that we missed after being away from home for a while.If you see a long queue join them, chances are they are good! That includes the popular "lor mee" (noddle in a dark braised sauce) store #01-116 which usually gets sold out by 1pm. The "Toa Payoh Rojak" (local mixed salad in prawn paste) store #01-108 give out a queue# and have a LED display to tell you when.it is your turn. The "Lao Fu Zi Char Kway Teow" (fried rice noddle) store # 01-12 and the Whitley Road Big Prawn Noddles store #01-98 are also popular among the locals.You can also find equally good food in other part of Singapore, such as the Whampoa Drive and Pek Kio market (Cambridge Road), better and cheaper than Lau Pa Sat and Newton Circle where most tourists frequent
5
We are expats living across the road from this excellent hawker centre. If you're from Singapore, you'll know about this place already. If you're just visiting, it's well worth going to see real local life.A hawker centre is a collection of small food stalls, typically each is run by a family. They specialise in different things and competition is fierce. You can eat a wonderful meal here for s$3-5 with freshly made drinks for $1-2.At first glance it might look disorganised and rowdy, but then you'll notice the multi-storey car park at the rear and the large letters prominently displayed on each stall. The letters are the hygene standard as inspected by the government. Don't worry about the letter, they are all As and Bs. Indeed the government closes the whole place for cleaning every now and again as it feels the need!There is just about everything to be had here. From chicken rice, satay and chilli crab (the local speciality) all the way to crocodile and rays. Our favourite has to be Mrs Tan's stall, located in the second row, near to the sops end. No one can ever remember seeing Mrs Tan smile. She greets all her customers with the same stony face. Out the back, she keeps her husband and their son slaving away turning out delicious vegetarian food. It's very popular, so beware the wait time and ask up front. Definintely worth a visit
5
there are many nice traditional food at this food center. The old airport used to be just a stone throw away, hence the name 'airport' added onto the food complex. Tim sum, salad with shrimp paste, fried noodles, chickeen rice, you name it, if it is not here, it is not possible to find somewhere else. Some shops have been serving singaporeans for many generations. My fav hawker center
5
The masters of hawker food have gathered in this large,crowded food centre. It is constantly crowded and you have to wait for tables but its worth it. Fatman satay still packs a punch from its Satay Club days, so does the wanton noodles, the char koey teow, the rojak, the beancurd dessert, the prawn noodles from Albert Street and so on. It's nearly all good.
3
This is a local Hawker food hall. Lots of local food choices. We didn't see any tourists there. We ventured there because of a recommendation from a Hong Kong magazine. This stall - "Mattar Road Seafood Barbecue" - is famous for Chilli crab, White/black pepper crab. The food is very good, but we got charged tourists price. There is no menu. You tell them what you want and they tell you the price. They charged us $6 for fry vege, $18 for 4 King prawns; while the average dish price in the hawker centre was $5 (which we found out later. We should have looked around first). The live crab is $35/kg, but they don't measure it in front of you. The food is good (tasty and no stomach problem), but we feel like being ripe off. We ordered a Black pepper crab, king prawns, fry vege and some rice, it costed us about SGD$70. This costs about the same as the Japanese dinner we had the next day at Clark Quay !If you are adventurous, do go and try the food. Make sure you go to a stall with a marked price menu
3
Cheap and good. Though the wanton noodles at the front row is popular, but is not to my liking. The one at haig road is better.
5
Solid local food...though wished that the Rojak stall will open more often....keep missing it
3
One of the largest hawker centres in Singapore offering a wide range of local food.
I don't recall any stall that is really outstanding but it is the perfect place to take foreign visitors to enjoy 'tiny bites' of different local food.
2
Front row stall:Fish & Chips
Good fish but the chips is too thin. If the chips can be crunkle cuts will make the best.
5
Many variety of excellent local food & value for money
4
The variety here is recommended to visitors who want to try a good variety of food. THere are some very good food here and some average. As a guide, most of those with queues are usually pretty good. I don't have any favourite stalls but in general I try to have chicken rice, fried carrot cake, rojak, chicken wings, seafood, nasi lemak. THe variety is endless. However do note that the centre is closed for cleaning about once a month for a few days. In such case, just hope on bus 16 or 33 to DUnman FOod court or Joo CHiat road for more eats
4
This is a "real" local hawker center. Almost no tourists. Not the best atmosphere, no view, just the typical concrete, plastic set up. But, really excellent food stalls - ask a local for advice. Came here with friends who knew where and what to order, and everything we had was great! Noodles, pork ribs, satay, carrot cake, dumplings - all excellent local style, cheap and fun.If you are in the area, you could hardly do any better than here. Excellent value for money, and a real taste treat
4
Too much to offer here. They have the char kway teow, whom the chef wears a rolex (tis is famous). Just to name some of the nice food located here:1. Fish soup2. Char Kway Teow3. Lor Mee4. Kway Chup5. Wanton Meeanytime for a simple hawker meal, you will be spoilt for choices (and they taste good too). One of the famous hawker centre in Singapore. As usual, no service and no atmosphere; its a hawker centre

Top 5 that I've tasted so far...1) Wanton noodles - Kallang Wanton noodles 2) Wanton noodles - the stall in the front row that doesn't require you to take a number. It's two stalls away3) Oyster omelette - Old Airport Road stall inside the center4) Pasta Mania - Inside the center. $5 for Carbonara5) Prawn Noodles - Whitley Road. Front RowWill update once I sample more :

I'm very disappointed to see places like Morten's, The Line rated tops in Singapore. They are fantastic restaurants, with due respect. But they aren't even local cuisines! It must be the work of expats who stuck to their comfort zones, visiting only the familiar places.I urge all, expats, tourists and locals to visit the Kallang Airport Food Centre. Go for a stall called "The Holy Grail", or a few "Tse Char" places that are rated by Makan Sutra

Some of the cheapest and best street foods can be found here. Other good hawker centres to eat at include Chinatown, Amoy Street and Clementi Hawker Centres. Singapore offers the best and most varieties of street food at prices impoosible to beat in the world!!! :
