My friends all say this is the best black pepper crab. I'm not quite fond of spicy food. But the taste is acceptable. Environment is very local folk style. Tourists may also drop by and try. Location is not ard tourist place. Try to reach early as crab normally sold out after 8pm as most dinners advised

Listen - if you like fancy dining forget it. This is the sort of restaurant you find up and down the peninsular - almost like a mini food court with plastic tables and chairs, no attempt at decor, just food. The atmosphere comes from the frenetic staff and the tables full of families eating.First Grade is famous for crab. We ordered some kailan - which was not bad, had better, but welcome all the same, and some seafood hor fun, again good though not outstanding. But we'd come for crab. Frankly ordering two not one was overkill between two of us. I could have left the hor fun and shared one crab and been very happy.It was nothing if not peppery - the spicing was perfect, the crabs big and juicy. OK it's messy as anything to eat but also great fun.It wasn't the cheapest - 80SGD for the food alone, but it was very much my type of place. It felt like home. And the crab was sublime. If I had a niggle it's that we needed crackers and crab forks - and lots of paper towels at the table - but hey. I'm a fan
