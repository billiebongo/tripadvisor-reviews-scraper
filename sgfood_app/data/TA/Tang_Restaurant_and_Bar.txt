The place is rather small and food is slightly pricy. Only 2 people were available to serve everyone, so service can be a little slow.

The soup base is spot on. Restaurant is a little hidden and you need to step in from the bar area to enter. However, it is a cosy setting with straightout comfort food.

This is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that I crave. I especially like the paper thinly-sliced fish and the shrimp balls. All of their soup base is made fresh. The ingredients are so fresh. The owner, Zoe, is a wonderful host. She remembers you if you go there often. The staff are helpful as well. I also like the wine selection. I would consider this a high-end hot pot restaurant

I haven't found yet a more delicious top-quality Chinese cuisine in Singapore. This place is a gem - the food is exceptional. Some of the choices available for the steamboat I could never find in other places. And I absolutely trust it for the freshness of the food.The menu is extensive, it is great for big parties or cozy dinners. I love it for the intimate atmosphere and a great hospitality from the staff. I feel they place a great value on the food and the people they serve it to. You may agree, it is rare to find. So I was defeated, and now keep coming back. For lunch, the stir-fry is absolutely amazing! A great value for money - it is just SGD 16. Believe me, this portion you will need to share

I was invited to dinner at Tang Restaurant and Bar. I couldn't locate the restaurant at first as the front was a bar and it did not look as if there was a restaurant. I was shown into the restaurant which was cramped. The good thing about the restaurant was although it was serving hot pot there was a good cool temperature going and very little smokiness and steam. However, the food was unappetizing and super spicy. The spices numbed my tongue and curdled my tummy. I like chilli and spicy food but this was a bite of chilli with every bite. The food was expensive and the quantity was inadequate and sparsely presented on long plates. The drinks menu did not have a wide enough variety. You should only go if you enjoy this type of cuisine as it's Szechuan hot pot. However, I would like to express my thanks to my three Philippine waitresses. They were super pleasant, efficient and nice. They were smiley and kept topping up my water and ice when they saw I was out. It was a great change from the bad attitude of wait staff in restaurants nowadays. Big thank you to the waitresses and I hope your management appreciate your excellent service.

Hot pot can be messy but at Tang restaurant, it is very clean and the service is five star. Only fresh ingredient and the broth is amazing. Perfect for a business dinner or any occasion where you want to impress while chatting in a quite atmosphere

We had a great night with local friends. The host took over ordering for us and we had a beautiful chianti with our meal although expensive at around $90. Overall it was $122 per head including 2 bottles of the red. If you want to try a Singapore hot pot it's a safe bet at a pric

Restaurant is a little small on the side, but on the overall, the quiet ambience was there, and the dining experience was good. The staff were very helpful, and the even served us even though my group were alright with helping on our own. Price is a little bit on the high side. Food wise, I would recommend the herbal soup. The mala soup was too spicy for my stomach to handle, but taste wise I find it alright.

Went there for a hotpot dinner with my wife. Booking over Chope app was smooth & easy. The seeting in the restaurant was cosy & the service was great. The food were fresh although its a little on the high side for that location. Anyway, its the money u pay for the service & ambience. A little regretful was the ma la soup could be spicer.

My wife and I were walking through China town and fancied a quick bite to eat. Found a lovely little restaurant. Not big but very nice. Staff were extremely friendly and the food was delicious. Wish I'd found it earlier on my holiday as I could have eaten there every day and not been disappointed. What made the restaurant so special was that they opened the restaurant for us an hour and a half before they were scheduled to open. How's that for customer service? Highly recommended
