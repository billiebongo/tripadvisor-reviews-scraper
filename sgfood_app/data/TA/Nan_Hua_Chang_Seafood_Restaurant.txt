We enjoyed Crabs, Kerang, Sambal Kangkong and it was yummy. The price is affordable for all family members who eat in this restaurant. The location is nearby from the hotel that we stayed. This restaurant is good and we will come again.

Food is great. They have two floors where the 2nd floor is air-condition. If you gonna sit at the ground floor, try getting the table nearer to the roadside as it is very stuffy inside by every table of steamboat.

We enjoyed the fish steamboat and salted egg yolk prawns and thought the food were pretty good. However, we felt that the prices were a little too high. In addition, the staff were rude which left a bad after taste. It's a disappointment that a restaurant with such fame for its food has became complacent and failed on other equally important factors that makes customer wanting to return again. As such, I have decided to give this place a lower than average ratings

The first storey of the restaurant is not air-conditioned. Head to the second storey (stairs are quite hidden) if you need some cool air (air-con). All that we had ordered were tasty: sambal potato leaves, egg with minced meat, stir fried french beans, deboned pork meat (my mum's favourite and it became ours too. She asked for it to be deboned), fish soup (not so tasty compared to other fish soup we had ever tasted. The fish was kind of dry too), broccoli and prawn paste mid joint chicken. The servings were good and the price was alright. Some of us ordered homemade hot barley. It was authentic. They have very big tables to accommodate large groups. The individual toilet cubicles are situated far from the other.

The food is awesome, everything was great! The Steamboat is the main attraction and you can taste the smokiness of the charcoal in the fish soup which really hits all the right spots! This is the kind of food that makes you want to be a better man and live life to the fullest.Cuttlefish Kang Kong - Excellent, fresh cuttlefish, spritely vegetables and a deliciously tame sauce that doesn't scrimp on flavor.Salted Egg Pork Ribs - Very Good, lovely flavor.Prawn Paste chicken wings - Excellent! Crispy and juicy without being overly greasy. Its perfect because nothing is wrong with it

Tasty but certain local staff are rude. Other table ask for chili they wee served but I was told to get them myself. High rating for the food but service can be better.. But well this is not a Michelin place. Will come back for the food hope the service improves

It's an easy place to go to. And their elements are simple. Fresh fish, charcoal steamboat, and traditional soup base. The first time I had it, the soup was so sweet that I thought there might be MSG, but it did not get me thirsty. Then I realized it's the real deal

It was my first time visiting this restaraunt. I ordered the main dish pomfret fish steamboat. They have different portion available depends on how many person is dining. The fish used is very fresh, soup base is very rich. Yam and vegetables are also added in the steamboat. I also ordered potato leaves cooked woh sambal, which is also very delicious as well, the vege is very fresh and crunchy. Service wise they are also very fast and friendly. A great place for dining with family
