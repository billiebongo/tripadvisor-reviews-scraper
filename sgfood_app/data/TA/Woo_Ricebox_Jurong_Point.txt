I really liked their Fried Chicken ricebox, but this time i tried another one, hot and spicy chicken. It taste like those MALA things you have outside but not as spicy. I really like the sides also. Filling and satisfying meal.

I really loved their lu rou fan, its not very filling. But i love to add a spicy fried drumstick to it to make it a perfect combination! Yum.

very friendly staff. menu has quite a lot of choices so takes a while to read through all. food is ready quite fast. the mala soup not sure if it's seasonal but is good. a lot of ingredients inside and very worthwhile to eat. you just pay $1 to add a drink. the melon tea is delicious
