Food is so creative and also very yum!! Love the snowcrab bee huen soup and the desert.., I really can’t remember what are the ingredients but it’s a taste of local n damn good!
5
Really loved the food and desserts. Recommendations were spot on and the drinks were lovely. Worth the experience.
5
I've been to Sinpopo several times already and at each visit there's been good food, a chic retro space and attentive staff. The HJK burger is a must-try!
4
Didnt have much expectation and thought that the food may be mediocre. But it’s so delicious that we swear we will go back again!
4
This is the first time I will wrote a review about this place after eating there for 3 years now. I highly recommend their nasi lemak for 2 and their specialty shakes ( panda and gula Melaka are both promising) I have taken atleast 5 of my friends to eat there.
4
Appreciate little gesture like putting a small happy birthday “cake topper” on the durian pengat as i have indicated that the visit was a birthday dinner for my mother-in-law who loves durian pengat. The durian pengat is decent though abit sweet for us, but the rojak slaw & cod fish tang hoon are definitely worth a try~ interesting fusion dishe

It was a group brunch.We ordered nasi lemak set for 2, baked cod, pork chop, sng muay pop, longan slushie, gula melaka cake and a durian cake.The ma ling crisps was so good. Sambal was tasty and it’s free flow. The cod was baked to a perfect tenderness, tho the vermicelli that accompanied it was too salty. We love the sng muay pop, very refreshing after such heavy and sinful mains. The durian cake was a pleasant surprise as it wasn’t sweet yet had the fragrance of durian. Both cakes were soft and moist
5
A friend who lives in Singapore recommended this restaurant as it was my partners birthday on our last night in Singapore . It’s in a very trendy , but authentic neighbour and we loved the food . Definitely recommend if you want to try something different
5
Read a lot about the cakes here. So decided to come by for my own birthday. The staff here are attentive and friendly. Had some starter of crab wanton and ma ling crisps. Both are nice but will not make me come back again for it. Had kiam chye arg as main course which was surprisingly very good. The soup is not too salty from salted vege but instead had a hint of tangy. The arg aka duck was fried to have outer crispy while inside still juicy. Mixed in with the soup, it’s just prefect. My standard of kiam chye arg are high due to growing up with nyonya food where the is a must. I highly recommend thi

Had the nasi lemak set, wagyu horfun and baked cod. they were all good except the horfun; the crispy horfun just didn’t gel well with the soup. The manager’s service was good. He offered to take from various angles when we asked him to help us take a photograph.
4
This place is a MUST-GO for Durian lovers.
Durian Pengat - Shiok! Durian Cream Cake - also Shiok!
The main courses are passable...save your stomach space for Durian desserts please!
If I lived in Singapore, I’ll be one regular customer for sure!
4
Ambience and food was good. Will definitely revisit again. Would like to recommend the restaurant to friends and relatives
5
Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Great ambience and food was timely served. Will definitely go back again with friends. Highly recommended to those that love nyoya food.
2
Old School Feel & Staff were really attentive & quick considering this is mid-priced. Food choices very very limited. And not exactly fresh or tasty. Sorry
4
Sinpopo Brand is an eatery/cafe located in the Joo Chiat food enclave that serves local cuisine with a twist whilst maintaining traditional flavours. Their selection of pastries and desserts is als not to be missed out.
4
Nostalgic vibes with good food. Had pork chop and crab bee hoon. Both are quite nice. Tried the pandan kaya tart and gula melaka cake. Prefer the pandan kaya tart as the gula melaka cake was too sweet to my liking.
5
Been here at Sinpopo for a few times since randomly chance upon the name on Chope. Very creative menu and definitely an excellent twist to local food without compromising on the taste and flavour!
2
I had the chicken burger, localized version, which was just terrible:- oily,- chicken not fresh tasting like pork then,- ended up slightly sick with food poisoning.Just not fresh obviously. Be cautious. Typical cafe managed by locals who donâ€™t have clean hygiene procedure. AVA should conduct an on-site inspection
2
Good food and ambience but poor service and communication skills. Its extremely hard to get the wait staff's attention. One over enthusiastic waiter over sold us a dish and miscommunicated the promotion. After we ordered the dish, we were told the promotion is something else less attractive.
4
I know this place is rather highly rated but like all innovative places there's gonna be things that not everyone enjoy and for me, the dao jiao Cod's flavour didn't work. Pandan tart was average but gula melaka cakes texture was superb, if only it wasn't so sweet it would have been stunnin
4
A traditional and mixed with fusion cuisine makes a fresh difference than other restaurant. Good food and nice soft drinks. Price is not cheap but worth to visit. It’s about 10 mins driving time to Changi Airport.
4
Food is innovative but most of the food is deep fried. Desserts quite cool too. But ventilation of the place not quite good.
3
Interesting fusion food with a cosy ambience. Cafe is decorated with retro ambience. However, the service staff need to improve their attitude and attentiveness.
4
Nice little place with amazingly good food. Didn't really expect this but their fusion Peranakan style food was really impressive. Love the Nasi lemak. My Favourite was actually the crab beehoon soup, that broth was rich and aromatic. Their desserts were great too! Love!
5
It was an interesting twist on local food. I loved this Crab Bee Hoon. I also loved their desserts. They are not to be missed.
2
We took visitors from HK for a retro experience and was disappointed. Signature Nasi Lemak was a big let down. Rice was soggy. Our guest found a bug in the salad which embarrassed us tremendously. Overall quality of the food was very average and over-priced. The only retro decor was an old television and phone
5
Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner and service team was excellent. Extremely friendly and welcoming and able to explain their dishes very enticingly. We had their unique nasi lemak and do save room for their amazing desserts ... will definitely recommend this and wl be back for more of their delicious offerings.
3
The dishes were innovative but we all found them too salty. The crab beehoon had a good amount of crab meat but was the saltiest dish there. The beef hor fun was good but the deep fried horfun tasted like it was fried in overly used oil. The nasi lemak rice is good. Desserts are ok if you really have a sweet tooth.
4
Local eat with a twist, makes it an interesting eat.. We ordered their signature nasi lemak, which was a sampler of their side dishes. Crab bee hoon was delicious too. Sliced wagyu horfun was not to my taste, just find the “crispy” horfun too chewy. Very interesting dessert menu and I went with the Gula Melaka cake which was very fragrant and nice, kaya tart has good after taste and the orange kaya creme brûlée tatsted the best.
5
We wanted to try some local dishes in East Coast and came upon this restaurant. Pleasantly surprised by the authentic taste of obviously recipes from long ago. Nasi Lemak was good, for one hungry person or two small appetites. The pork chop was juicy, duck confit was falling apart tender, chicken burger with what tasted like home made mayonnaise. And all the desserts are worth a try. Definitely worth a visit
4
Ambience and service are great but not many seatings. Thus, it is recommended to book the table in advance. The dishes are more towards the strong flavor kind.
4
Quite pricy , we had Nasi Lemak set for two, the only downside on the nasi lemak is the sambal chilli. Overall, quite enjoyable.
5
Food was surprisingly good. Love the vintage and retro deco and ambience of the place. Staff was friendly and helpful.
5
very creative and yummy food pairings. it's like fine dining of the local kind without the exorbitant pricing. only setback however was the plentiful msg. extremely thirsty after meal. but heck. Will certainly visit again. love the drinks! still wanna try other dishes/drinks.
4
The food is nice. However, a bit pricey. Nasi Lemak, rice is fragrant with coconut smell. Cod fish with vermicelli, the cod fish is fresh and tasty. Pandan soufflé is unique where you can't find it anywhere except in Sinpopo. Customer service is good. The down part is that it takes quite long to get their food served. So if you are in hurry, please do not go. If not, it is a good place to have a chat with friend while waiting for your food. Please reserve a seat before going, to avoid queue. As the space is quite small and packed with diner that are waiting for their food to be served.
4
Located at Joo Chiat in a shop house . Interesting menu . Servings don't seem large but somehow is more than sufficient . Try the Nasi Lemak - enough for 3 actually , crab bee Hoon, beef Hor fun ( crispy Hor Fun ! ) , desserts all Gula Melaka ones , and the Sng Muai ice drink ! Go for Sharing and one can try more varieties. Staff are friendly and do make a reservation as it can be pretty busy ! Car Park ... got to park and walk ! A return for me ...
3
Love the concept of the restaurant, atmosphere was great. Went there with 3 other friends to try out the place after seeing my friend post about the Pandan Soufflé. We had the Nasi Lemak, Crab Bee Hoon, Chargrilled Pork Chop, Muah Chee Salad.The food was overall tasty but we felt that the food - Nasi Lemak and Crab Bee Hoon could be better if its less salty especially the Crab Bee Hoon. Muah Chee Salad is good but the portion could be bigger with a little more vege/Muah Chee
4
Been here several times. Many come for the desserts but i like both the food and desserts. We usually go for the nasi lemak but this time we also tried the prawn paste chicken burger and the wagyu beef kway teow (thick rice noodle). The beef kway teow was unusual. The kway teow was individually deep fried, served on top of the beefy, slightly sour stock that whets your appetite
3
Staff was friendly and helpful, though they were busy and we sometimes had to wait for service.The Grilled Pork Chop was dry and tough, and the crab beehoon was too salty and didn't taste good. However, the Muah Chee in the Muah Chee Salad is out of this world - so innovative and addictive! The Gula Melaka Shake is super yummy - very sweet and rich, so perfect for sharing with someone.The Browned Butter Sugee cake was way too sweet and had no real flavou
4
My parents and I enjoyed most of the dishes served. Service was excellent, provided by a staff named Michael, who engaged us constantly to check on us and ask us if we need anything else. He also asked about the quality of the food and gave detailed recommendations to us. Ambience was nice, seating is not too crowded and each diner will have some privacy.Dishes we ordered:1. Nasi Lemak for 2 - rating 9/10- My personal fav was the fried Ma Ling luncheon chips but parents found it too salty.2. Wagyu beef fried horfun - 7/10- Very interesting rendition of the dish, beef was very nice but the gravy was really too salty. - Fried horfun was quite nice initially but after being soaked in the gravy became very salty and hence I didn't finish the dish.3. Crab wantons - 8/10- Can taste the real crab meat inside, but sized abit small4. Pandan coconut shake - 8/10 & Gula Melaka shake - 8/10- Both drinks are quite thick and shiok but are quite sweet.5. Canned rambutan drink - 7/10- Not as refreshing as expected6. Sng Muey Pop - 9/10- Really enjoyed this drink, refreshing!Total damage: around $90 for 3 pa
4
Ordered crab bee hoon and nasi lemak. The crab bee hoon is really delicious. Love it. Nasi lemak was so so thou
2
The food was great. However the service was terrible. Even though the staff was polite, but the response and service level was terrible.
1
Senior Restaurant Manager who does not bother to inform you that a certain cake cannot put birthday wordings and you only find out when you collect the cake. Such a disgrace!If you can accept that when you make a booking for a cake with wordings and when you collect the cake, there is no wordings, and they did not even bother to tell you, then you can continue to patronize them
5
The foods came with smaller size than usual, but as for me and my wife we both love the size as not too big portion. While friend saying the food rather in smaller size. Overall food wise are good, this is the 2nd time we visited here.
5
Great service from a malay guy. Initially we were given a table for six which we then feedback was too small for us, and they immediately gave us a new table for 10. The waiter makes it a point to address me by name. Only downside is that the table is located a little far from the view of the waiter. Food was all wonderful! My parents liked it too!
3
Living not too far from the restaurant, we visited Sinpopo a number of times for the really good and unique food. The service was always slow and never up to scratch but it just came secondary as it was not in any way tragically bad. Unfortunately it simply just got worse to the point that it's no longer worth visiting. This is a real big shame as they have some amazing dishes (Salmon with noodles, potatoes with curry, wantons, nasi lemak, porkchop, gula melaka cake, pandan souffle) but the service has deteriorated so much that it's just not worth it anymore. Last time we visited we had to wait over 45 mins to actually get our starters. We asked the waitress 3 times about where our food was and we didn't even get a response. After almost an hour and 20 mins we managed to get our main courses. Even though we had ordered our desserts at the very start (knowingly that they ran out of everything fast) we were told after we finished our mains that our desserts were given to another customer by mistake. By this time we were too exasperated to even bother making a fuss about it. On other occasions the food has either been late, one of the mains come out several minutes after the other, the staff seemed either overwhelmed or uninterested. A couple of weeks ago, despite our better judgment, we decided to visit Sinpopo again being that we had guests from abroad who were eager to try the place. We made a reservation for 7:30 and arrived to find that the place was full and a line of over 10 people waiting outside. Despite trying to wave down one of the waitresses to let her know that we had a reservation, none of the staff was to be seen or were simply too busy to even manage to speak to us. We eventually got shown to our table only to be told that more than half of the dishes (starters/mains/desserts), were already sold out and/or unavailable!!!. There was really no reason for us to stay at the restaurant as all the dishes we actually wanted to try, were already gone. It really doesn't make sense how a restaurant can run out of nearly everything not even halfway through service. If you have a fully booked restaurant it makes sense to stock up on your dishes especially on a Saturday. The management and the kitchen staff both need a wake-up call. It was not the first time that we arrived, with a reservation, to be told that several of the dishes had run out. All things combined can only point to the management of the restaurant falling behind. Fortunately, it's the last time for us visiting Sinpopo. Such a shame
1
Went for dinner with high expectations but was sorely disappointed. Wagyu beef Hor fun: feels like a dish trying too hard to be different - Hor fun was deep fried and as a result was a really oily dish that was also really salty. Crab bee Hoon was also really salty. Nasi Lemak was decent but nothing to rave about. Chilled Pandan soufle was way tooooo sweet. My 1st and last time there - $100 for 3adults and 1 child is definitely not cheap but the quality is definitely not worth the price ta
5
My 1st visit here. Impressed by the food quality & excellent service rendered by Michael & team. As it was a weekday night, the place was not crowded & enough room for everyone to be comfortable.Impressed & booked for a birthday gathering for the week after
5
This is a retro spot that has so many little interesting things worked into it's design from early Singapore times. The food was tasty. Really liked the toast and we had the nasi lemak for two which was a great way to try a bunch of items. All really tasty. The muay pop was a really good drink, not to sweet and nice and crisp
5
Hidden inside this hipster cafe is not merely a retro 1960s theme-d layout, Sinpopo also sells many interesting dishes which is largely a fusion of Singaporean and Western cuisines. Everything on the menu sounds delectable and it was hard not to order the entire spread they have. The interior of Sinpopo is relatively small but feels cosy enough for meals and though their service staff strength seems rather small, they are attentive and swift on their feet!Even though I was there for lunch at close to 2pm, the place was still bursting with people! Thank goodness I have made a reservation on Chope prior to that
3
I wanted to try the pork chop but it was not served today. I ended up trying the Kiam Chai Arg (salted veggie duck), nothing impressed. I love the Gula Melaka Cake very much, worth trying
2
No wow factor. Jus cheap food re dress. Nothing great except the desserts. Too much hype over nothing
5
Great Service. Food was not bad at all. Nasi Lemak Set we refillable rice and sambal was quite legit. Especially the sambal. Katong Jelly drink was interesting in a good way. Worth a try.
5
Food was good. we ordered the lemak for 2, portion was quite big, can eat 3 ladies. Staff was attentive.
1
Please get rid horrible reclining chairs , service staff are bad & need training. Only saving grace, NASI LEMAK is really Good!
3
Been there a few times. Experience was a little better during lunch when restaurant is not full. At dinner time, service is rather haphazard. All the service staff, while friendly, give the impression they are not listening at all except for the senior person who made a quick decision to rectify the issue we faced. Plating of food was also inconsistent giving the impression that kitchen staff had problems coping.
3
Location is good, easy to find, the overall ambient is cool, tables is not too close to one another. The service is great, very friendly. We ordered a nasi lemak set and find it too salty and not spicy enough for the chill. The Melaka cake was too sweet for us
3
Small cafe with nostalgic feel. Ordered their signature nasi lemak set for 2 pax. Rice portion is small. Ala carte rice is at $3 which is quite pricey. Rice is quite good with strong coconut & ginger smell. Goes very well with their sambal chilli.The sampler serving of the Har Chiong Gai chicken wings is not bad. The marinated pork belly is very good with strong fermented bean taste. Their babi toast I won't recommend. Saw a few tables ordered their signature wanton. The size of the wanton is pathetic. We tried their marshmallow cheesecake which I will not order again. Service is extremely slow especially when we asked for refill of the nasi lemak rice. The other table has to help themselves with the ice water. It's a good to try place if you want something different.
4
Nasi lemak is still the bomb after having it 3 times. The free flow rice and the SAMBAL CHILLI is sooo good. Remember to pre-book the Nasi Lemak set for 2 in advance if you're going on a weekday! Extremely friendly and helpful staff.. although the pre-built walls in the place do block their vision. But once they see you, they will sprint over to cater to your request. :)
4
Was greeted by friendly staff once we step into the cafe. The deco of the cafe suit the nostalgia theme. Ordered the Nasi Lemak set for 2. It's quite value for money consider the rice & sambal chilli are free flow. Will definitely be back for more
1
So many items in menu not availabl which is simply annoying! Long waiting time without informing or checking on us. Food is so pricey. Will never return.
3
This place has an interesting ambience with very interesting local food.
Recommended to come and try if you are around here.
4
Bringing my mum to this restaurant. It reminds her alot of her memory, while i was a child, due to its retro interation decoration and songs. The food is excellent. Great place to relax and chat, while enjoying delicious food.
4
It's hard to find local food with a twist, this place stays true to the original flavour but presents the flavours in a unique and interesting way. Service at the restaurant was really friendly too. Portions and prices were good too.
5
Come experience the great food and be pampered by the impeccable service, while you sit back and relax here.
5
Had the Nasi Lemak set for 2, it was divine! Great spread, everything was delicious :) especially the thinly sliced deep fried luncheon meat~
4
Overall experience is good and service crew is nice and efficient.
Do try their Nasi Lemak for 2 and durian pengat when you visit :) I personally feel that these 2 menu item is well priced and will fill two adult's stomach just nice ^^
4
We've eaten here quite a few times and it is great. The desserts are so good - especially the sugee cake and the durian pengat. All the entrees are yummy, although I think a bit small. The nasi lemak for two is nice and the beef hor fun is good too. The crab meat bee hoon was a little too salty when I had it last week. However, over all, a pleasant place to eat with friends
5
This is local SIngapore dining. Typical of an old location redux from an inventive Chef putting out a great twist on old and new Singaporean food. It is a simple unassuming restaurant. Not fancy and service is young and trying but not attentive.We dug in with the Nasi Lemak for two the house specialty. Something I always go for. Nasi lemak is a very tasty rice with all the sambal you can eat. Tasty chicken wings, fried spam (I KNOW but trust me a taste sensation), fried chicken breast, The fish balls w sambal were delicious. The Rojak was ok the flavours great but the texture was too mushy for me. Pork belly on any menu and I'm in...this one was succulent and flavourful. Potatoes with curry awesome cause of the curry. I wish I could be more helpful than delicious and flavourful - but the staff weren't that helpful in describing or helping me decipher what was on a dish.....just let me tell you it was great. Worth a trip and $25++ for two a real deal. Plus a cab there and back. This is not a public transport place especially late dinner. But worth the trip. And if you can go before sunset, the strip is worth walking for the gentrification of the neighborhood.Will post pics from my phone.Enjoy

Sinpopo was the name of a notoriously sleazy nightclub in nearby Tanjong Katong in the 1960s to 1970s. This place is nowhere as sleazy but everything is retro 1970s Singapore style: the mosaic tiling on the floor, old "modern" furniture, old light switches, standalone TV cabinet etc. The menu is a copy of an old school attendance record. Traditional food is served with a twist here. Try the Nasi Lemak for Two and the Har Cheong Kai Burger. Or the Sng Muay Pop and Fake birdâ€™s nest. Dessert was good (but relatively expensive).Parking around this area is usually a problem. If you do not want to drive around looking for a street side parking lot, I suggest parking at 112Katong which is just at the junction. Do not park illegally at some of the private car parks or your vehicle may be wheel clamped.
5
Must haves - Nasi Lemak set, har cheong kai wings, durian pengat (heavenly!), milo dinosaur milk shake, teh tarik specials!
5
Had the nasi lemak for 2 there, was really good and they give you as much coconut rice and sambal as you want. Service was efficient and friendly. Cakes there are soooo good too.
4
Effort was put into creating a nostalgic ambience. Food was wonderful, just enough. Highly recommend the cakes - wonderful!
5
The food was nice, especially the Marshmallow Cheesecake. The waitress actually take note of my comment and surprise us with a lighted calendar on a cake we ordered.
5
A really nostalgic and comfortable cafe that one should visit! Food was really palatable. Service was relatively good too as there were free refills of items such as sambal Chilli and rice. Deserves a second visit.
4
Pros:- taste delicious. They twist some local food into something wonderful- cosy cafe with the touch of retro chinese cafe- wide selection of menu. Notably their "nasi lemak for two" love it so much. - menu available in english- the price is standard price for cafe. Main course like nasi lemak is 25sgd and can be for two people. For the cake is around 7 sgd- they provide cold tap water for free- they can make delivery- they have lot of seat. Can be a good place for gathering place.Cons:- slow in service. Today i only saw one lady doing order and server too.- no wifi- behind the toilet has a slope which can be dangerous to visitor. Saw a water in the middle of slope to
5
Much effort has been put into creating an nostalgic ambience reminiscent of growing up in Singapore in the 70s and 80s. Every detail from old-school food menu designed as an attendance book to the rattan cane chairs were well thought out and presented in a elegant manner. Would highly recommend the Durian Pengat dessert - a heavenly combination of delicious durian paste with refreshing coconut ice cream. Service team was polite and attended to customers professionally
4
Nice interior decor, which makes one feel really at home. Food wise, a little chinese-western fusion style with innovative menu. I tried the wagyu beef horfun and it was yummy. The amazing part was the horfun was fried and it looked like dry fish maw. The horfun was crispy and when drenched in the gravy, the soaked noodle just tasted exceptional. Service wise could be more proactive as I found the staff a little lethargic, but it could meant they were tired from a day's work - I went in the evening. I would recommend this place to families and friends who wish to have an experience of our past, immersed by the hug of the old fashion chair and drinking from enamel cup, reminiscing our old school days, juxtaposed by latest English hits. What more can one expects
4
It was my third visit to Sinpopo after a long while, and was pleasantly surprised by new additions to the menu! I introduced my friend to the signature "Nasi Lemak for Two", but was a tad disappointed that the Roasted Potatoes in Curry has been replaced by Potato Wedges in Curry instead. The former was really good! Perhaps the staff was really young and new, there was a mix-up in the order and I waited half an hour for the dessert and the message was not conveyed properly. Nonetheless, give this a shot and you will love the ambience as you travel back in time to the older Singapore
2
I been to this restaurant twice in the past 5 months. Following are the segregation based on what I have experience;Ambiance:Retro and they try to emulate the Old Singapore at all touch points of the restaurant. Good job!Service:Mundane except the cashier staffsFood:Pretentious Nasi lemak and lack the originality. The coconut taste is too rich. Common feedback from 2 different race of friends. Creative combination between Malay & Peranakan food. But overall taste is not distinct or one that you will remember for sometime. Value for $:The worst part of this restaurant. Located near 112 Katong and they enjoy premier class locals but they are taking for granted in terms of steady flow of customers. Good time is find but bad time (economy sentiment), people will ditch such places. They can at least be more generous in their portion. The Crab Bee Hoon which gives the best taste being valued at $16.00++ seems to be catered for kids menu. 3 out of 5 friends end up still craving for more food after stepping out of this restaurant. We end up going for another mini bite at Fat Boys which located right opposite this place. Above that they charge 1 coconut rice at $3.00++ and that can be steep in my opinion. I feel customer will start to weigh against the absolute value they gain from this restaurant.That is all folks
5
Sure you can get similar items elsewhere but the decor here is just too cute, if you enjoy Singapore nostalgia you should visit.
5
The food was really good! The twist to the local delights was subtle, so the originality of the food still stayed. Really enjoyed the desserts most.
5
Crab bee Hoon is our all time favourite and their luncheon meat. Not forgetting their nasi lemak which is value for money
4
Love the deco & menu items. Variety & quality are good. Service isn't great for us as our group of 7 is tucked away in blind spot table.
5
Nasi lemak for 2 was special and indeed tasty. Well done on the pandan souffle and brown sugared suji cake! Creative food yet original strong taste :D the atmosphere kinda brings you back to the old school days and I will be back again to try other food
4
Tried their nasi lemak and it has all the ingredients I love - potato wedges in curry, luncheon chips. Muah chee salad on the other hand is a bit lacklustre. This restaurant will be better if there are more seatings as I noticed several walk in customers were being rejected. Please do reservations in advance if you are coming for peak period meals
4
Visited Sinpopo with family in search of dessert, and it really surpassed my expectations. I would visit again just for the nutella tart, which was really outstanding- although a bit pricey at twelve dollars. But it was big enough that I probably would not have been able to finish it myself and plus, it came with a very generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. The ambience was probably one of the best I`ve seen in Singapore. It had this clean,retro feel that was very appealing and sometimes remniscient of an old public school. The service though, managed to top even that. Our waitress was very friendly and made us feel very comfortable. She even gave us water before we asked, probably knowing that we`d be thirsty. The desserts we ordered were the nutella tart as mentioned before, as well as gula melaka cake. The gula melaka cake was not as great as the nutella tart, but it was still tasty. However, it was too expensive- seven dollars.  In conclusion, Sinpopo has very good desserts, as well as great ambiance and service. Sadly, sometimes it is a bit pricey
4
It was a great first time visiting Sinpop Brand. The location is very easy to find, just a stone throw away from Katong I12 mall! Ambience of the restaurant is old-school style, and the staff there was very friendly, explained to us the signature dishes of the menu and also was very well-knowledge on the menu. Tried its Nasi Lemak set for 2 which comes with free flow Sambal and Nasi Lemak Rice, which is superbly worthy in terms of the price and amount of food! Tried its Katong Jelly and Fake Bird Nest drinks, which in my own opinion is not worthy of the prices ($7 and $5 respectively). Thankfully, the desserts made a sweet ending to the meal! Ordered its Orange Kaya Creme Brulee and Marshmallow Cheesecake, both priced at $7. The Orange Kaya Creme Brulee is a very special combination, which comes with crispy cheese breadcrumbs which compliments well with the creme brulee. Portion was also very huge! Nothing really to shout out about its Marshmallow Cheesecake though!
3
Even though the rice and sambal is free flow, i still think its not worth the money, chicken wing was super super salty!! Never eat anything so salty before. All of our food is serve and we started eating but one of us is not serve with the Kiam Chye Arg. Kiam Chye Arg is only served when the rest of us have finish eating
3
Getting There:Accessible via vehicle is more convenient but parking might be an issue during perk hour. Ambience:Nostalgic, a nice place to chill. Food:Tired their signature Nasi Lemak for 2. It was not bad, I would give it a rating of 3.5/5. - Price is on the high side- Sambal chilli is more on the sweet side no spicy. - Sambal chilli is free flow - Nasi (rice) is also free flowTired their desserts (Gula Melaka Jelly & Gula Melaka Cake) as well & would give it a rating of 3/5. It was nice but it was too sweet for us. Service:Services was good overall.Overall: It was a good try out.
3
Love the decor and the cafe vibe. Very old school and nostalgic. We booked for early dinner but nearly half of the food menu was out of stock. Service was pleasant but not very professional.
3
The food is not bad but price is on the high side. However the waiting time for the dinner is simply too long, I was there at 7pm but waited till after 8pm before I get to have my dinner served.
5
Recommend to make a reservation, walk in maybe not able to get a seat, to avoid any disappointment, make online reservation please! =)
5
How refreshing to be greeted with an enthusiastic smile! Wonderful service & delicious food at this delightfully decorated old school cafe/restaurant.
3
Generally the place decorated in a retro theme so ambience is good. However the serving time is very long. Food presentation is creative but taste wise is more to the salty side.
4
Did a take away of desserts - gula Melaka and sugee cake were incredibly tasty. Cannot comment on other food on menu or dine in but I hear from friends the food is good. Definitely keen to try again. It's something different to tantalise the tastebuds.

We stayed at Hotel Indigo on East Coast Road this time and its just 3 mins walk to Sinpopo. We had the donuts with gula melaka and affogato, gula melaka jelly and sour plum pop. All of them tasted so incredibly nice. Unfortunately it was our last meal before heading home to Sydney, will definitely come back to try other dishes in our next trip to the merlion city.
4
we ordered the nasi lemak set, char grilled pork chop and har cheong kai burger, then gula melaka jelly and orange kaya pisang creme brulee for dessert. overall, food was very nice. just that we had too much har cheong kai and so we didn't finish the wings in the nasi lemak set. our favourite was still the nasi lemak set because of the luncheon chips, sambal and rojak salad. we wish there were more sambal and rice served each time (free flow) so we don't have to keep stopping to ask for more. staff were very informative and helpful, definitely will go visit again :)

Ordered the nasi lemak set with free flow sambal and rice! I think nasi lemak was quite ordinary, not worth the price tag but worth the try I guess. Crab beehoon was flavourful and I thought it was much better than the nasi lemak! Didn't get a chance to try the desserts though..
1
Patronized Sinpopo for the first time as we have heard some good things about them. Several items were not available on the menu. Food was great but male service staff was less than gracious. Pulled a long face with every small request like ice and extra rice for Nasi lemak.
4
I enjoyed how the dishes were local yet with a bit of a twist. The food was fresh and delicious, and retains local flavors.
5
A nice vintage decor and the most delicious desserts with a local twist. I highly recommend the gula melaka jelly, pandan and durian desserts.
3
I like the creativity, atmosphere to catch up over the weekend. Staffs are attentive. However, the food were only average.
4
I planned to go with my better half however we are too excited to try most of the food at Sinpopo, hence we have get my sister to join us. We had Sambal fishball, Har Jeong Kai Wings, Baked Salmon as our main. For Desserts, we had Durian pengat, Doughnuts & Gula and Orange Kaya pisang cream brulee. As for Drinks, we had Longan and pineapple slushie and katong jelly. Thumbs up for the food. For Durian pengat, the rich creamy durian give you the warm feeling in your throat although the dessert is cold. And you need to be patient as is quite short handed when the whole place is fully booked. You definitely need to reserve seats to avoid disappointment.
2
Food wise, their food are tasty but too salty and sweet, even for sweet tooth like me. Service staff are bad, except for a guy who is very courteous and friendly. The place was less than half filled when we were here and they just blocked the whole place for reservation, backward services, just like the place. Come here for food and not for service, low rating due to service. Lastly, place is not toddler friendly.
4
My friends and I made reservations and when we arrived, we were given a table at the back of the shop. The waiter took the time to explain this gave us more privacy for our conversations and that there would be a service attender to check in on us occasionally. Indeed the service was prompt and very thoughtful. The food also did not disappoint. Our favorites were the Har Cheong Kai Burger and the durian pengat dessert.Overall, it's a quiet location for a good chat over good food

Sinpopo Brand was a pretty nice place to catch up with friends especially the 'Old School' concept brings us back when we were students. Table was a little too small for the amount of food we ordered. Wanted to try Nasi Lemak for two but it was not available. Instead ordered Crab Bee Hoon and Grilled Pork Chop and many other sides. Though a little too pricey but enjoyed the food nonetheless. The staffs were very friendly and one lady even advised us not to order that extra Gula Melaka Cake as the Durian dessert's gonna be really huge, indeed. Overall, I enjoyed very much but really wanted to try the Nasi Lemak.
1
Have come here on a few occasions and have always found the food to be too oily as most of it is fried and salty. Nonetheless, desserts are good. Especially the gula Melaka cake. The salted egg cookies are yummy too. Unfortunately, I must say the service was ridiculous at this last visit. The near empty restaurant at the end of lunch hour (only 1 other person here) and the waitress was insistent that we sit at a small table and not the one we picked as she was expecting a large crowd. Seriously? After lunch hour? In a totally empty restaurant? Where there are plenty of available tables since there's only one other soul here apart from us? Service lacks thinking.

Nice atmosphere with lots of space between tables, don’t feel cramped at all.Service:- Went on a Public holiday and it seemed like they were shorthanded. 1 guy at the bar (doing drinks) and 2 other gals, service crew- Guy at the bar is not the friendliest service crew ever. Was ignored when I told him that we have a reservation. 1 other gal came and showed me to my table.- Observed him when we were leaving and still had the “black” face. Perhaps he was too overwhelmed by the crowd??Food:(1) Nasi lemak for 2 - basically it’s like a sampling platter of the items offered in the appetizers menu. Rice was “free flow” , max of 2 bowls/ pax. But really, the serving of 2 bowls combined is just 1 bowl. $3 for an additional bowl of rice.(2) Crab wanton and crab mee hoon was not available. That really leaves us with nothing much to order as menu is very condensed. (3) Wagyu Beef Crispy Hor Fun – tasty but the crispy hor fun felt too oily and "jelat". Ate the beef slices but didn’t finish the hor fun. My Sis enjoyed it though and finished hers.(4) Waited near 15 mins for our Nutella tart and English breakfast tea. Reminded them and was later informed that the bar was too jammed up with orders to serve us
5
An ambience that takes you back to the early days. Was a little turned off by the stainless steel share plates which reminded me of the Dentist... Staff was friendly and attentive. They are also child friendly.Food pairing was unusual and a little on the salty side
5
A nostalgic cafe at Joo Chiat.. Glad to find this cafe.. The crisp Luncheon meat, Sambal Fishball and the Crab Beehoon are really Yummy! Lack of stomach space to try the cakes.. Will definitely be back for more!
5
Ambience is excellent. Food is special!!! Fried Ma Ling fries was simply awesome..... Will go again....
4
the ambiance was very nice. the food is good. we had the nasi lemak for 2. Portion was big, the luncheon crisps could be better if it wasn't stuck together as a big lump. The sambal was to die for.
5
Really wanted to try the Pandan tart but it was sold out
Tried the Pandan soufflé instead, it was really good.
Overall pretty good food. Will go back for dessert again
3
Food was okay, but waiting time was quite long. We waited 20-30mins before our drinks and food was served.
3
Our 1st visit to the hip retro cafe which served simple nostalgic food. We were particularly drawn to the menu design! We ordered FrisÃ©e Salad with Crispy Muah Chee (S$10), Crab Bee Hoon ($16), Har Jeong Kai Burger ($16), Gula Melaka Cake ($7), Sng Muay Pop ($5), Fake Bird's Nest ($5
4
It was the salted egg yolk cookies that got our attention and stirred our curiosities initially. Entering Sinpopo felt like a travel back in time, the restaurant is nostalgically curated bringing back many fond memories for us! Amongst the staffs' recommendations we enjoyed the Har Jeong wings, pork chops (perfectly grilled!) and Gula Melaka cake. We also had Ma Ling Luncheon Crisps and the Har Jeong Kai burger*, both tasted abit salty. The refreshing Sng Muay Pop hydrated us, completing our meal.*Odd that the chicken cutlet in the burger tasted saltier than the wings despite being prepared with identical recipes
4
Restaurant decoration is interesting - a tinge of the old days of Singapore.Serving is prompt but staff could have provided more info.We have to request for water.Also, we didn't know the nasi lemak comes with free flow of rice until we read the review after our visit.Food is nice and tasty but portion a bit small
4
nasi lemak set for 2 is good with free flow of rice. crab bee hoon is good too! and har cheong gai burger was abit salty but still okay. overall was nice but waiting time might be abit too long thou. finished my burger and my friend's crab bee hoon still not served.
5
Nestled in the heart of joo chiat, Sinpopo serves up decadent food, with an interior that houses power to transport you back to that push pop era. Kids from the 80s can except your local nasi lemak served in the most interesting concept - a sampler of dishes that will make Malaysians want to eat this for lunch and supper as well. The prawn paste chicken wings were ACE. In total there were 7 side dishes and who knew luncheon meat chips could be a thing?Will be back to try other stuff!
5
The staff were prompt and courteous and the food was served quickly. I love the Ha Cheong Kai burger and the coconut jelly dessert.
5
The service staff were very friendly. They were well versed in the menu. The ambience was nice. The place brought back a lot of fond memories of our past. The food deserves two thumbs up. Will definitely come back again.
4
You have to order their signature Ha Jiong Gai burger. It is worth the money. We also ordered Singapore Crab Mee Hoon and unexpectedly it was also yummylicious! You should go and try. My boyfriend wondered why is there no queue for this restaurant though.
4
Food was fantastic & very creative. Strongly recommend the Crab bee hoon & their desserts. Crab wanton is excellent too !
5
Went to Singpopo twice within 2 weeks. Once as dinner (where my reservation was missing from Chope) and once was lunch.Both times was good and fun for my friends and I.We have a great and wonderful time reminiscing the good old times we had in the past while enjoying the food. My order for Crab Bee Hoon was slightly slower than usual, but this doesn't deter me from enjoying the bee hoon when it came. Overall, a nice and good chilling places with friends, couple and family.
4
Sinpopo is a great idea. I wasn't born in Singapore but the menu and feel of the place creates a good "old-school" illusion. The food is excellent and presented well and is reasonably priced. There's a good mix of items and all with a nice twist. Service is good when asking for recommendations but (and I have found this having visited the place on several occasions) the team are slow to clear the plates at the end of the meal and follow-up with dessert orders, the bill etc. This is a minor point but it contrasts with the approach in most other restaurants in Singapore where attentiveness appears to the be the number one priority. Overall though, Sinpopo is well worth a look. I have been a number of times and will be going back again
3
Interesting old school, nostalgia-themed restaurant-menu disguised as students' attendance book, metal tray, mugs, etc. Tried the Nasi Lemak for two, Crab Bee Hoon & Wagyu Beef Crispy Hor Fun, Gula Melaka Cake & Nutella Tart only to find that they tasted average. Looking at my bills, I'll have expected more.
4
This fusion restaurant brought back the concept of either Singaporean food with western influences or vice versa. Everything we ordered was tasty and brilliantly presented. Drinks (local design) were also incredibly good and great fun. All in all a good experience. However, the service was lacking. When they were present, very good, but the problem was they were never present. Due to the design of the restaurant they could not see us when we were at our table. Had to get up and go to attract their attention whenever i wanted something

Interesting way of making the Nasi Lemak - Combination of Sambal, curry potatoes, deep fried crispy lancheon meat, deep fried pork, rojak, prawn paste chicken wings and sambal fish balls. It costs $25++ (Total of$29.43 after adding 10% Service Charge and 7% GST). So sambal is unlimited and my friend said so does the rice, we both didn't finish them all. I wouldn't say it was an authentic nasi lemak as that was not traditional nasi lemak, it's more like a food platter of deep fried and with sweet chili paste asian dishes combination. It was an interesting dish combination but not particularly impressive.We actually ordered main dish (Nasi Lemak) and the Chilled Pandan Soufflie, the waitress served the Pandan Souffle first and absolutely didn't take the order of our main. Despite such mistake, the dessert was good - DEFINITELY NOT Souffle though, it was more like Pandan Ice Cream with crumbles. It tasted refreshing full of pandan flavour. It costs $9++ (Total $10.59) for a small portion.Drinks wise we ordered ice-teh tarik (They charge additonal $1++ for ice so it's $7.06 total) and Sng Muay Pop ($5.89), drinks were okay - not particularly unique. One thing to mention was the chair, not comfortable at all. I wore short pant and ended up with lines marks on it because of the pressure of sitting on it in an awkward position. Didn't take a photo of the chair but you will see when you visit the restaurant.So the total bill for two lady dinner of Nasi Lemak + dessert + 2 drinks = $52.95I will go back to try other desserts that friend said taste good but we didn't have room to try that night

Staff are in great in explaining menu including popular dishes. The menu is well laid out and whimsical which got me all excited at the prospect of trying something different (har chong kai burger, pandan soufflÃ©, durian penyat with coconut ice cream) I love the retro feel of Sinpopo but truly wish their food was better. Small portions aside, Sinpopo's take on beef hor fun or crab bee hoon is disappointing. While the crab bee hoon was generous with crab and roe, the crab didn't taste fresh just salty. The promise of 'wok hei' was not delivered. The wagyu beef hor fun tried too hard to be different but it too, failed to deliver on taste. The har chong kai (deep fried chicken) was too salty. Probably better in a burger? The durian penyat did not have enough durian for my liking. The texture lacked the rich pulpiness of real durian. The coconut ice cream while pleasant on its own lacked the flavour of coconut. Probably not intentional but I was reminded of kaya (coconut pandan jam) with each spoonful. Enough said
3
Friendly and excellent service but food was too salty and oily to our liking. Drinks was too sweet too. However, worth a visit if you want the experience.
5
Had a lovely dinner with family. Good atmosphere and very friendly staff. Food was uniquely good and Signature Gula Melaka cake was awesome!
5
I probably had one of the best burgers in my life here and it was made of chicken! Amazing desserts with a beautiful, 50/60s Singapore theme. Love Sinpopo!
3
The staff were friendly to explain the menu best seller's and what were sold out and were attentive!
4
This place has some reinvented old Asian coffee shop favourites in a chic retro schoolroom environment.
The coffee and cakes are also very nice, and it is all situated in the lively Katong area.
3
Went here for dinner, ambience and service were nice and and the food was quite good also, just a little over priced. But the pork chop I had tasted nice and the pandan cake was also quite tasty.

Every time we're in Singapore we head to Sinpopo for an unusual take on the traditional Ais Kacang. Ais Kacang or Ice Kacang is basically shaved ice with seaweed jelly and red beans in the bottom and flavourings of rose syrup and gula melaka aka palm sugar. There's usually attap chees which is a fruit from the Nipa palm in the bottom too and traditionally it comes with a sort of cream of corn on top.When going to hawker centres in Singapore you can choose whatever ingredients go into the Ais Kacang like lychees, fruit, chendol and agar agar which are types of jelly. I usually don't like the "kacang" bit which is the red beans nor do I like the corn so I just ask for it without them.The Sinpopo one is always awesome and it's amazing how high they stack the ice some times. The twist that they have in their version is that there are these tiny balls that when you bite into them, they explode a sweet lychee flavour.If you like sweets and are looking for a nice refreshing break from the Singaporean humidity, duck into Sinpopo and cool down with an Ais Kacang.Cheers!Dave

I'm surprised by the distinctly average views of this place (maybe it is because of the huge choice in Singapore and the Katong area) but personally I had a really great meal here. The chicken burger was succulent, perfectly crispy on the outside and just downright tasty. The service was good, and the staff friendly and attentive. My wife had the short rib hor fun and that was also excellent. We also tried the roasted curry potatoes - an Asian twist on tapas patatas bravas, also excellent. I will definitely be coming back for more
4
Wasn't overly thrilled with the rather expensive deconstructed nasi lemak set for 2 when I first visited, not long after Sinpopo opened, but a recent repeat visit changed my mind about this place. The desserts were thoughtfully wrought, the coffee strong, and my delicate gula melaka jelly, quivering on a lozenge of a plate, was completely moreish. Two of my true-blue Baba (Peranakan) mates pronounced the food acceptable, which meant it was pretty darn good
3
Liked the deco. Retro and clean appearance. Friendly staff, interesting menu on old style attendance book, but no pictures, so we couldn't picture what we were ordering. Ended up with the Nasi lemak for two and baked salmon. Food took 55 minutes to come. Portion was small. Not that you would want to eat more because it's the same taste throughout the dish. I don't understand how the glass noodles and salmon can taste the same- burnt and salty. Argh.The Nasi lemak was served as six small dishes - har cheong chicken wings x 2, sambal Ikan bilis, curry potato, sambal with onion, air fried luncheon crisps, and roast pork/fish cake. The sambal was flat and not spicy, chicken wings ok but not spectacular, roast pork was burnt, luncheon crisps also. Small portion of rice. All finished in 15-20 minutes. Cost us $75 with tax. Only one drink - katong jelly, which again wasn't something worth the $7 we paid.
5
Unlike the more popular hangouts like Clarke Quay, this is a lovely place to chill. The service is also great, with the manager coming around to talk to the guests too. The food is also amazing, enjoyed the nasi lemak and gula melaka cake especially
1
Nice place to hang out but the service is really slow. The food is not gourmet but coffee goes well. Ordered a pork chop with potatoes and the meet was good but there was only a few small potato wedges.
4
Loved the gula melaka jelly as well as the curry chicken. The overall feel of the restaurant was also perfect for some quite afternoon time.

Waited over 40 mins for our food with no staff being observant enough to notice that we seemed to be the only table not serve despite being one of the earlier ones. We had Har Cheong Kai Burger and the Beef Hor Fun. The burger came, look massive but otherwise toooooooo salty. I felt so sorry for my partner who couldn't down another bite so suggested if he would like to check with the staff if a chunk of salt or something might have been unintentionally added to the batter. To our horror, we were told "You are just not used to it" By then, I didn't bother to comment that my Hor Fun gravy was too salty too. I had to squeeze all the gravy out to eat. They could have garnish the Hor Fun with Bak Choi but instead it was rather plain with 2 slices of beef. Called for bill and the young lady acknowledged but continued to lay table with utensils instead. I let her off thinking she would get the bill after. But instead she moved on doing other stuff. I had to signal her to remind her that I have asked for the bill from her earlier. She looked rather anxious when she realized she forgotten for a good 15 minutes. Not going back ever again

Turned up with a group of friends at 12 noon- time it was slated to open and was told by a young and charming waitress to give them another 2 minutes. When the doors opened in 2 minutes, we were met by cheery smiles and were promptly seated. We were told - we needed to wait for 20 minutes if you want nasi lemak, other items would be quicker and then - as we began to order, stark realisation was that many items on the menu at the start of a business day were not available.Well we decided to wait for the signature nasi lemak though we should have known better. 20minutes was what it took to get the first drink out - a simple cappuccino. The Nasi Lemak took an hour and 20 mintes. Taste wise - absolutely not worth the wait and not worth he $25 for 2 persons.Conceptually, Sin Popo has got it right in ambience and even in menu choices, but really - the most unauthentic fare and the erroneous impression that opening time of a restaurant does not mean the kitchen needs to be ready adds up to the worst dining experience in a long long while.Met some friends as we walked back to our car - on hearing that we had gone to Sinpopo their spontaneous response was "Oh no!" That said it all
5
Excellent restaurant .Absolutely delicious food.Our kind hosts, Fook and Mabel, who are residents of Singapore took us to this super restaurant for dinner and to experience the best of Singapore cuisine. Fook and Mabel requested half portions of everything for us all so that we could experience as many different dishes as possible.If you are visiting Singapore do yourselves a favor and eat where the locals eat when they want a gourmet dining experience.Service was impeccable and every course was of superb quality
2
Well, the revamped Sinpopo is all about deep fried and oily food. Surprisingly, even the short rib beef noodles saw the noodles deep fried then soaked in broth. Hmm. It was just oily, oily, oily. The Ma Ling Luncheon Meat Crisps were oily as was the Babi Toast. Other than it being oily, it was salty. What saved this place is the lovely service and quaint set up.
3
The retro design and colors attracted our attention so we tried this restaurant at Joo Chiat. We had Chicken Curry Rice, Lo Gai Yik and Ngoh Hiang. The chicken curry was not spicy and has the home cooked taste. The Lo Gai Yik is a Cantonese stew with chicken wings, meat and tau pok. It was too salty and the chicken wings could have been more tender. Ngoh Hiang was ordinary. For desserts, we had Bubur Cha Cha and Tau Suan. As we requested desserts to be served later, the tau suan arrived very hot maybe just out of the microwave after reheating. Service was poor. The waitress dropped our cultery twice and did not even apologise. They served the wrong dishes more than once. They served the tau suan and then took it back when they realised we wanted it after mains. Overall, the prices are a tad higher, the service level can be improved, the food is alright. The saving grace is the atmosphere it offers with the decor and the oldie melodies, it was still an interesting trip down memory lane. Try it for yourself.
4
Nostalgia. The songs played could have been more retro and they should update the variety of songs. Food wise, the scissor cut rice tasted pretty good for me - the curry sauce wasn't spicy, good enough for young kids. Desserts is definitely the main attraction (other than the nostalgic decor). Try the durian pengat. But be warned - it is very rich and filling, so you might want to share that bowl with a friend
3
I had seen photos of this theme cafe and knew I had to check it out. It had a steady crowd for a Friday evening, so good for them. Personally, what nailed it for me was the fact that dining here brought back fond memories of a era gone by.Sinpopo Brand, along Joo Chiat Road, is not difficult to locate. With its open concept and bright red grilled gates taking centre stage, one cannot miss it. Wait staff also stood at the front of the cafe beckoning customers in. This cafe employs the 'placing orders yourself' tactic, very wise considering the labour crunch these days.It serves comfort food, e.g. nasi lemak, roti john, cheng tng, etc, everything that we Singaporeans have eaten one time or other. Add to that the cosy ambience, and the mandarin songs of yesteryear, this cafe is a must-try for the nostalgia it brings
