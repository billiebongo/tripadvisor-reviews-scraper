We come here very often and all we cansay is the food is very love and surely amazing...only downside wqs the washroom..
1
Book for 7.30 until 8+ no seats yet. Walk in 8 ppl jump Q. All staff can only speak Chinese. WTF. What's the point of booking!!!! HORRENDOUS SERVICE
5
Very yummy and at a reasonable price. Three of us ordered three different flavor of crabs. Don't forget to order sour plum juice to go with it

We went there for dinner at around 7 pm midweek without reservation and had to wait in line for about 30 minutes. There were four of us and we ordered their chilli crab, black pepper crab, shrimp cooked in creamy sauce, a vegetable dish called civa something (that turned out to be chives stir fried with garlic) and chinese tea.The food came relatively fast and the star of our meal was the black pepper crab. It was spicy but not overwhelmingly so and the crab was succulent and delicious! I'm not a big fan of chili crab as it's too sweet for my taste but my husband loved it. The shrimp was fresh but none of us liked the creamy sauce. It was just too creamy for our taste. The stir fry chives dish was just average. The entire meal cost around SGD 170. Pretty expensive, especially since we only really liked maybe 2 of the 4 dishes we ordered.Overall it was okay

My family & I wanted to start the New Year happy, at our favorite seafood place at Melben’s in Ang Mo Kio. Where we always go for our crab cravings. Sadly, the service has deteriorated as its popularity has risen. We’ve been eating here since it was in a coffee shop in Serangoon. That means we go a long way back with this restaurant. This New Year evening as we queued at 5.30 pm, we were hurried through our orders. Spoken to in condescending manner by both the young man who spoke Malaysian-accented Mandarin as well as by the impatient female Supervisor who refused to give eye contact because we were slow. We couldn’t understand their confusing “ procedure” of orders in order to get seated at a Table, or waiting til our party is complete before having our orders sent to the kitchen. They were both too impatient to explain . They kept moving on to other customers while we were trying to clarify. Our food order took several attempts. I felt sneered at when we explain our smaller portion order of pork etc was because while our table was for 8 adults, the two Muslim Helpers can only eat non-pork dishes. I’ve never felt so insulted before in any other same price restaurant in better venues. As a point of interest, the two crabs we ordered cost $165. The two stars I’ve given is only for the food. Nothing else for rude service. It will be the last time I’m fulfilling my crab cravings at Melben. For the price we paid for the entire meal, we could have eaten at an air conditioned restaurant served by professional servers. We didn’t even bother to give Mr Boon Chuan the feedback. Yes, he was there but oblivious to his staff’s lack of service. Because it is a very POPULAR restaurant where you queue and wait an hour to be seated and another hour to be served with food. Really sad to see a good quality restaurant deteriorates because it’s become too popular

We were there with my mother. I called to reserve a table but they did not take reservation. When they know I have an old mother who cannot just stand to wait for a table, they advised me to arrive earlier before 6pm. Yes, when we got there, they offer us the first position to have a table. We had both chilly crab and creamy crab, all delicious.
4
We took a bus from AMK hub there for a night of feast.Due to its popularity, all diners need to be present before you can get a table and you are only allowed to order once (no subsequent add-on orders).5 of us ordered one crab vermicelli soup and one butter crab plus 5 bamboo clams. The dishes are really full of flavor and really finger-licking good.Certainly a place worth coming back in the future (but not too often for our health's sake)
4
The hotel concierge recommended this place and actually walked us across to it as it was so hidden away. It's not much to look at, pretty basic and partially outside but was busy with plenty of locals. We got seated straight away but the service was a little slow. The food was outstanding, Chilli crab was great and the ribs were out of this world. I would definitely come here again when in Singapore next time.
5
This sure is a very busy restaurant. Please bear in mind that they do not take reservations and you have to come and stand in the queue. Great atmosphere even though it is on the ground floor of the Apartment block. Their signature dishes are the Crab with beehoon or rice vermichelli and the butter crab. But I find their Chilli crab very good. The chicken that is cooked in Chinese herbal sauce is very good too. I rate this place much better than many of those over rated place. Service was friendly and good

I was visiting Melben Seafood @Ang Mo Kio. The location is quite far from Orchard. We've tried to make reservation a day before but the said they don't take reservation, first come first serve. They open at 5-10 pm. We get there at 6.30 the queuing is quite take times. Around 30 people stands in line and have to waited up to 1 hour before we can be seated, but meanwhile we stand queuing, they asked what menu do want to order. I order crab with bee hoon, ribs and mushroom with scallop. Actually I prefer Chilly Crab.Taste of the food is so so. But the price is quite expensive.Nice to know the taste of the famous Melben Seafood, but that's enough
5
Best plump juicy fresh crabs I've tasted in a Long time. Succulent meat comes off easily from the pincers and the crab bee Hoon is a delicious blend. Only complaint is the Long queue (almost 1 hour).
4
Probably the best crab in singapore. Good range of sizes. Service is quite good. The only downside is the price. If it was only slightly cheaper i would come here everyday!
5
Chilly crab at Mellben is the best dish in Singapore. We like it very much. It is a must-east food every time when we visit Singapore.
4
Great dinner with family as dishes ordered were tasty & Chilli crabs were very fresh & meaty. Abit pricey but worth trying. Comfortable environment with nice Coffeeshop setting. Weekdays reservation is acceptable but wkend need to Q.
5
One of the best crab noodle place you must come to try if you visit singapore. Located at Ang Mo Kio beach that I have visited is the best. Weekdays can take reservations but not weekend. No aircon but is not hot at all. Butter crab, salted egg crab are the few must try food there!
3
Mellben crab regardless of Chilli black pepper, butter, spring onion and ginger or with bee hoon soup are always finger licking good but be prepared to burn a hole. A medium size 1.2kg crab will cost you anything close to 100bucks. Certainly not for weekly weekend dinner affair.
4
We had our dinner at the Tanjong Pagar branch which offers the same menu as at the Ang Mo Kio location. Ordered the chef recommended of crab mee hoon, and side dishes of garlic clams, yum bird nest, salted egg prawns. These dishes tasted exceptionally good, suitable for anyone who wants to try the crab dish other than the popular Singapore curry crabs. Seek advice from the waitress on the order size of the crab mee hoon according to number of guests, to have capacity to try other side dishes
5
Our only regret about Mellben Seafood is that we waited till our last night in Singapore to eat here. We wish that we had a few more days in order to try their different styles of crab. We got a table straight away although they were almost at capacity and people started to queue after we arrived. Prices are not super cheap, but quality is there and menu is extensive. Can be a bit tricky to find as during the day other food vendors use the foodcourt area, but at night is is only Mellben Seafood
5
good place for crabs!wide selection of cooking methods. You name it, they have it.the ordering of crabs was very civilized, the restaurant listed out different crab size with their estimated weight and price. Expectation was well-managed.with this local, no-frills style kind of restaurant, do not expect fancy seating or overwhelming service, you get what you pay for. Fair deal.highly recommended!noticed they charged only SGD$5 for corkage, good to BYOB
5
This 'void deck' restaurant offers a uniquely singaporean dining experience. Mellben is a well known for their butter crabs and crab bee hoon, though I often see people ordering their black pepper crabs as well (they offer chillie crabs too, which is not too bad.. try it here if you have limited time in singapore). Please try thus at their Ang Mo Kio branch (short bus ride from AMK mrt) as I've heard they are not consistent between branches.
3
We tried the outlet in tanjong pagar, it always long wait for the food, the queue isn't that bad compare to the Toa Payoh but there's still waiting time for your crab dishes.
4
Yummilicious & huge Sri Lankan crabs! Tried Chilli, salted egg and black pepper! Enjoyed it. Do make a reservation if u r going in a big group.
4
Brought a few tourist friends to this local restaurant for chilli crabs, and all rave over it. Their Guinness stout pork ribs is also very flavourful! You just have to try it!

When in Singapore........When you visit a country there are the regulation Must-Do, Must-See and Must-Go things to do. For me it was not to eat but to 'experience' the very famous Singaporean Chili Crabs. There are many must-go to Chili crab places there and we were spared this stressful decision-making task when our cousins, who live there recommended we go to Mellben. To my delight, Mellben was just walking distance from where they live in Ang Mok Kio, an area I fell in love with because of the proximity of great restaurants and the main attraction which is ta da....a 24-hour fully stocked grocery called ShenShong with the freshest produce, meat and vegetables! A Disneyeland for food and grocery lovers. That's another story.I'm digressing-Mellben is an open-air no-frills restaurant. The place is big and airy. I don't know if it's comfortable at lunch because we went there for dinner. There is a line...or a queu and food attendants taking advance orders. My cousin told me it was like that at any given day. The food attendants were fast-talking, fast acting but polite so be prepared with your order when they ask what your order is. We were seated and given pink melaware bowls and plates. The place is simply laid out. Monobloc chairs, tables. A bar with a chiller displaying what beverages were available. The menu was filled with pictures-this is a place that's used to catering to locals and tourists. The highlight it seems were the display of framed crab shells and claws all over the place and the two artificial potted plants by the entrance of the wash rooms blooming with crab-shell 'flowers.' The wall facing the washrooms have also framed pictures of Mellben diners caught on CCTV who committed 'Eat and Run' I don't know what to make of this except I felt that the ambience brought me back to the 1970's. I totally adored its' kitschiness.Our orders came and it was very well worth the wait. We ordered in order which they were served: Scallops and Asparagus with dried Shimp Sprinkles, Stir Fried Kuchai and Mushrooms, Salted Egg Prawns and the piece de resistance....Chili Crab. It was huge. We were 6 and our majestic-looking crab weighed 1 kilo. All the dishes we ordered were enough to fully satisfy and fill us up without feeling bloated. Everything was perfectly cooked. The temperature just right. Seasoned with finesse, The dishes were simply and cleanly presented. I love the scallops and asparagues stir fry. The dried shrimp sprinkles made the seafood and vegetable stand out. The kuchai and mushrooms were sheer perfection. Lightly seasone, it brought out the smoky, earthy taste of mushrooms and the crisp-tender kuchai gave it a kick and a crunch that made the dish truly delectable. The crab was soooooo succulent!!!! We ordered a female crab and its' fat was oozing and plentiful, highly recommended! We could've used more mantou bread to sop up the thick, sweet and spicy sauce. Somehow, the mantou bread is never enough. We ate all these with rice and we felt like we wanted to sleep afterwards. No more room for dessert! I was glad that the night was cool and the walk back to my cousins' flat was pleasant. All in all, dining at Mellben is truly memorable. It's comfortable, it's a bit noisy, being filled with families and tourists, so don't expect fine dining here, just good old pleasurable eating - and who eats crabs using utensils anyway? It's fun!!! Just be prepared because the dishes can be a bit pricey, especially if you order crabs and other seafood.What Mellben lacks in ambience sure made up for its' indescribably fresh and delicious food and all-over cleanliness. Service is brisk too! I'd eat here over and over again

This is a very local restaurant situated in an housing estate in the heartland of Singapore. Had both the crab mee hoon and the chili crab. I prefer the former one because you can taste the sweet freshness of the crab, but the sauce for the chili crab was equally delicious! However the waiting time was very very long. We managed to get a table, ordered the crabs, only then to discover that we had to wait an hour for them ... ah well, the anticipation just made them that more more tastier I guess But crabs are def not a cheap meal though. But worth it because they are THE thing to eat here.
5
Went to this place with a group of friends; we called up and made a reservation, you still need to wait but not as long as if you hadn't made a reservation. It's undercover but open air; we were seated under fans so not very hot. It's great for a typical Singaporean eating experience with a loud and lively atmosphere and yummy food. my favourite was the crab bee hoon. Also good was the steamed crab. Pricing was OK but not cheap -may have been due to the fact that we ordered five huge crabs (the pincers were almost as big as my fist
4
We have enjoyed the various dishes of Mellben with friends and family. They have been consistent in quality and they have always impressed the overseas guests with their crab dishes, which they are famous for.Our favorites are:1. The clay pot crab bee hoon, with the soup so succulent and an explosion of crab flavor, reaching the state of umami. We often went for a second serve of bee hoon; and2. The salted egg yolk crab, the taste was intense and the combination with the crab was spot on.They also have the butter crab, chilli crab, pepper crab, and the Cantonese style shallot ginger crab, to satisfy different dinners' tastes. We found the size and quality of the crabs they cooked are of high quality consistently.Service was average but do expect a long queue.There is also another outlet at Toa Payoh that takes booking and has an air conditioned area upstairs.We enjoyed the food very much
1
The crabs are so so and paid 70 for 1 average crab. The scallop and veg are 30 dollar...8 piece prawns are 30... even a a coffee shop restaurant and selling at a restaurant prices is totally not worth.customer also need to queue before order and going to seat n table. Drinks are over price also. Please go else where and u can have better service,food and value for money
4
If you are craving for Chilli Crab or any other crab dish. The best place to head to is Melben Seafood Restaurant. One of the best crabs that I've tried in a long time! Had to wait in the queue for about 15-30 mins as the restaurant does not accept reservations, only does walk-ins. But was worth the wait when the food came. Chilli Crab is my favourite !
4
Ate at the one at Toa Payoh. Love that they open at 16h00, and not at 18h00 like most restaurants. Went here specifically for the chilli crab. Am sure this was the most expensive meal I'd have on my trip, but had to give it a try. Food was good, service was good. Locals eat here too, so that's always a good sign... At first I felt sliiiightly self-conscious, digging into my perfectly presented and tasty chilli crab, fingers & all... But then I realized that everyone around me seemed to be eating some sort of crab preparation or another...some albeit very "neatly" with chopsticks even :) Didn't stop me :) Good for a one-time "experience-splurge" for my Singapore travels
5
I used to go to No Signboard restaurant every time I visited Singapore. That stopped when I tried the crab at Mellben Seafood. This place is simply AMAZING!! This is the one restaurant every visitor should try when in Singapore. Enough said!
5
I was there on a Saturday evening. Though we made a reservation online, we had to wait for a little more than half an hour before seated. This place was full and very crowded. Having said that, the service over there was efficient. Our order was taken when we were waiting for the table. Everything has to be ordered before seating even the drinks. The food was tasty. The dish we like most was the clay pot crab vermicelli soup. Fresh and yummy.For those Duran lovers, there was a fruit store next door where you can sit down and enjoy various types of Duran and other fresh fruits on site

~unassuming Mellben is right under a block of flats with HDB parking right in front of it's row of shophouses, it was easy to find parking at about 5.30pm back in 2016May~invited by Angela for the first time, I expected a good seafood zi zhar place but had no idea it's real difference~I'd left it to my host to order the best dishes being unfamiliar with this seafood restaurant but upon looking at the menu I discovered this was a place where communication with the auntie order taker is key = the difference between good to GREAT~this is that kinda place where they tell you what style they can cook your fresh food choices so it's a TASTE place, you decide what's the taste you want today and it's cooked with the food, not in such a LONG long time have I been at a place such as this :)~I watched as Angela made choices by discussing what would the best way to cook an item nuanced by it's freshness, it's availability, it's Taste!WOWFried Bean Curd - surprisingly YUMzCrab Extra Vermicelli with Soup - simply 3x YUMz surely must try before you die! rich delicious soup, with more soup served up to top off the dish...! :)Creamy Butter Prawn - YUMzMongolian Style Pork Ribs - unexpected a bit rubbery yet delicious!Rojak Sauce Chicken - WOW YUMzSweet Potato Leaf - omG good vGood~and I was amazed not by the food but by the toilet (u just gotta see the photos)~my first Dyson supersonic air dryer tooThis is a one place that's worth the time to visit and savor tastes of anything cooked, you decide what you want to taste, not eat... I'd go again for the taste

I and my husband arrived at the Tao Pa Yoh Mellben at almost 5 pm (Thursday). We were the first customer, so there was no queue at all.We ordered Crab Bee Hoon and bean with salted egg. Both was delicious, especially the crab. We asked for 800 gr crab and it was big enough for us to satisfy our stomach. The crab was tasted like black pepper dishes; the crab meat was fresh, juicy and dense. The crab itself was costed around SGD 65. And they charged you anything you eat (side dishes such as nuts or sweetened fruit) and what you wear (wet tissue)
3
We went there for chilli crab as I had read rave reviews, The taste was above average but still can't beat others I have tried. For the price I paid, I did not feel it was good value given the coffeeshop ambience and the quality of service I received. We are unlikely to return when there are so many other established competitors that are more conveniently located and provide a nicer environment
4
I came here a day after I arrived in Singapore, for a lunch invitation and was not disappointed. Their chilli crab was superb and of good quality. Not sure what the bread that came with the dish is called, but they were a perfect combination. Apart from the crab we have some vegetable dishes, chicken dish and fried rice-all were good but the Chilli crab is a must to try if you ever come here. We came there on a weekend and was not very busy when we arrived, service was good and quick
5
Mellben Seafood is and outdoor setting on the bottom level of an office building. While the decor and atmosphere is nothing special, the food was absolutely fantastic. I tried chili crab in several locations and this was by far the best. My native Singaporean friends who were dining with me agreed that the food was definitely amongst the best they had experienced on the island. The queue for this place seems to get rather long. I arrived just a few minutes after opening time and had only a minor wait in the no reservation queue, but by the time I was leaving, the no reservation queue was at least 40 people long
4
First time to this restaurant by a Singaporean friend recommendation, quite big restaurant. We order an Original MUST TRY menu, Clay pot crab, it also come with noodles, very very good. Followed by another popular menu, Chilly crab. I found it a bit too sweet for my taste but I also finish it all. It came with Man Tou, Fried chinese bun. When you dip the man toh into chilly crab sause, it's TOO DIE FOR!!
4
We timed ourselves to arrive here on a Sunday night after 8pm to avoid the long queue and was successful. No wait, immediately got a table.The signature dishes are all crabs and we were not too hungry, so ordered the crab rice noodles in a rich broth, it was tasty.The stir fried veggies was excellent, the rest I can't quite remember.In Singapore you can eat dirt cheap (6SGD=roughly US $4.25) for a meal or expensive. This dinner for 3 was 150 SGD= about US $107) is slightly on the expensive side (for Singaporean standards) because the dishes were on the small portion side.The crab indeed was excellent and the yolk inside was huge.Hawker style settings so under hot and humid condition it can be uncomfortable
5
They are master in cooking crab. Be it the chili crab, pepper crab or their legendary been hoon crab, they always managed to bring out he best of its crab meat: flavorful and maintaining its firm and moist texture. It also offers some of the best quality and largest Sri Lankan I had seen - average 1kg and above. Amazing consistency food standard - after at least 10 trips here, I was never disappointed. If you find the queue not tolerable, can always use their very well managed take out service. This is a non-aircon restaurant and service was okay
2
We had our dinner there. The food was reasonably good. However, when we had to pay our bill the cashier was very unprofessional. In terms of service, i wouldnt recommend if you are looking for good service.
5
We were recommended this place by our hotel and it was amazing. The chilli crab was to die for. It was reasonably priced as well. Would defiantly go back.
5
We found this place after some research on the net, recommended by a European who lives in the area. It was a little tricky to find but a helpful bus driver put us right. I notice other people complain about queues, but I thought the queuing was slightly funny as the staff rushed around trying their best to accommodate everyone. (And that was at 8.15). We found the helpful and kind, especially as between the two of us we only speak English and Thai and they mainly seem to speak only Chinese. Food was superb, service was every bit as good as I would expect in a place like this and the price was reasonable, in fact cheaper than I expected. I would love to go back there when we have time to visit Singapore again
4
If you dun know what is mee hoon...come try MellbenMellben's crab mee hoon is a classicSouth east asia's rice vermicelli in white crab soup rivals the likes of noodles all over the worldServe in a giant claypotRanges from USD 50 to USD 100 a pot of white gold
4
Amazing crabs! Mouthwatering, tasty and simply the best. Spent 5 nights in Singapore and was eating here for 2 nights. On the first night, we had the crabs with rice noodles in soup. On 2nd night, tried their pepper crab and duck eggs crabs. Both meals were so delicious, it has left me craving for more as I type this review. Price is mid range...alot cheaper than the crabs we had at the Jumbo Restaurant in Clarke Quay. It's worth it...be rest assure. (BTW many top Asian actors, singers and foodies have their signature on the wall)Be prepare to wait if you go in after 7pm. Recommend going before 6:30pm or towards 9pm to miss the long queue
5
There are multiple locations and we ended up going to the northern location more towards residential. Worked out well because we had the local vibe, but also a nice spacious table upstairs and not a wait. Ordered black pepper crab, of course the bee hoon crab (soup style), salt and pepper prawns and razor clams. This place was amazing. Some of the best razor clams I have had, the S&P prawns were perfectly fried, not greasy, a little bit. The winners were the two crab dishes. You come here to eat sweet crab and this is it. Must go back again. We didn't even order the iconic chili crab, might not need to
5
Highly recommended by all my friends, I went there with full expectation and left with full stomach. Located at the basement in a low cost housing estate, everyone knows their name and its famous crab cuisine. Many people like their chili crab but I highly recommended their Crab Soup with rice noodle. Great taste on the soup that the noodle has absorbed will bring you a wonderful taste that you may not find elsewhere. To me, chili crab is available in many places) Be there before 5:30pm to order your crab (get the big one if possible because they are scarce) n take the seat. Otherwise, you will just waste time for long queue. They work daily from 5:00pm-10:00pm only. Be prepared to pay at mid-range pricing but it is really worth the price
3
There is a long line up after 5:30 pmand turnover of table very slow .Portably a lot of people come for the crab specialty , plus prawns .Will recommend this restaurant for seafood restaurant but not for friends and family gathering - way too noisy and you can hardly understand each other's. Hope you find this review helpful and vote for me
4
came on a monday night at 5pm. restaurant only had a few other tables with people so there was no wait time. we ordered the crab bee hoon, chilli crab, fried mantou, salted egg ribs, cereal prawns. cereal prawns here the shell wasnt very crispy like ive had at jumbo where the shell is so crispy that you can eat the prawn whole without peeling. the bee hoon was great! our fav of the night. the chilli crab was good. salted yolk ribs were delicious flavour but not the most tender ribs but wasnt dry/tough. the crab that night was $70SGD/kg. expensive but we would come back especially for the bee hoo
4
Good place for big group of friends who want to enjoy a nice dinner.Place is quite big and can accomodate prity big tables. We were 12 and no issue to book a table.Food is also quite good, mainly seafood. Overall good experience but found the overall price was quite expensive for a hawker center..
5
This restaurant give me a specific taste of Chili Crabs with competive price. highly recommend you should try:)
4
If you come here, make sure you order crab, especially the creamy butter crab and chilli crab. Other menu is quite standard. The place is crowded, so come early.
4
Went with family for dinner. The food not bad especially the crabs but do be there early as there will be long queue.
3
It's our usual Sunday out for dinner and we decided to give Mellben a try. We arrived around 6:45 pm and there was already a queu snaking around the shop. I had protests from the kids about the long queue but we persisted. Eventually, we got our table at 7:45. Our food was order before we got our table and we're told to expect 1 hr of waiting time for the food to arrive. Food finally arrived about 30 minutes after we sat down. The Chilli crab was good and the crab bee hoon was great but I don't really think I will want to wait so long standing in a queue for this level of food and this level if pricing. Don't think I will come again unless I happened to be around the area. For the same price, I can easily have the same of food in an aircon room and no waiting in line. But for what it's worth, the food is good , above average
5
Fantastic Singapore food experience. Genuine local cuisine & atmosphere with great quality & fresh ingredients. Signature dish is crab & you can have it served a variety of ways but be careful as a small crab is more than plenty for one. Let the staff guide you with recommendations - they are friendly & know what's popular. We also had the salted egg yolk pork ribs - wow . I love crab but these pork ribs as a side dish almost stole the show. Busy local atmosphere. Casual dining. But great food @ a reasonable price. Very popular - remember to make a reservation.
5
It was a rainy Monday night. My honey and I arrived around 6:30p.m. Not too many patrons and we got a small table right away.The signature dish is the mud crab. But the menu will not tell you how much a crab cost, it only tells you different ways of cooking. We ordered a pepper crab about 1 kg., a small size Mongolian pork ribs and braised bak choy with fresh lily bulb and deep fried soy bean sheet. The crab was big, in particular the claws, and the smell of pepper was definitely a turn-on. The onion slices absorbed the flavor of the crab and pepper which made it so tasty. The ribs were very similar to sweet and sour ribs except that the sweetness and sourness were very light. The meat was very tender and juicy. However, I doubted that was authentic Mongolian dish. The bak choy was crisp, fresh and sweet. The lily bulb was chewy yet soft. The deep fried soy bean sheets were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. And a fresh coconut drink certainly helped cooling down the heat. The cost for the sumptuous dinner was around S$110 (including 7% tax).

Portions are on the big side, so more group/family style rather than for solo or even 2. Location may not be known to all taxi drivers from the train station (if you're not arriving by bus) so make sure the driver knows before hitting off. The first taxi driver honestly told us he's not sure so we decided to go with another cab (no attitude either). This was our first visit so I kind of expected a more closed restaurant atmosphere, but it's more hawker/da pai dong 大排檔 style. The line moves fairly quickly since it's a big place. The waitresses are ready on hand when you're on line - they give you the menu and take your orders on a mini handheld. Do not expect air conditioner, there are some fans but they're not dysons, so dress accordingly if you don't want to sweat your way through the meal.The chili crab was a bit of a letdown personally, found the sauce to be on the 'wet' syrupy side rather than a dry rub kind of chili mix. Heat level isn't really hot either, maybe jalapenos are actually more spicy. However, I finished the plate of salt egg rubbed ribs. A pretty unique dish that's sweet and savory at the same time. Fried mantou seems to be a popular dish too for groups, it's easy choice for a bit of carbs to pick up the leftover sauce/soup from the crab you order.Prices are not that cheap considering it's not a typical tourist destination area. Certainly not hawker cheap but a good place for a catch-up with friends or family
3
Just visited this seafood restaurant with my group of friends.From my point of view as local,so so.Food is expensive,an portion are small even we order medium.That famous bee hoon crab,was a turn off.Too milky and hardy any favour,except milk taste and watery.And the que is not worth...estimate 1hr to 2hrs.depend of the days.Staffs service were quick,like want you faster order and eat and go type.Parking plenty but also depend on luck if you go 7pm to 9pm.And worth on weekend/holiday.Last word,this place are more for tourists
4
My first trip to Singapore and my Singaporean friend brings me here to try the crabs. Delicious ! We shared a chilli crab and a crab beehoon. My preference was definitely the chilli (but always is). Fresh and a good size it was plenty of food to leave me satisfied. The service is good, but yhe restaurant is not cheap....however it is definitely worth it.
3
Had dinner here with about 20 people. Ordered quite a few dishes but the only nice ones were the salted egg Long beans and crab bee Hoon. The rest were just mediocre. Crab bee Hoon was really good with a rich seafood stock and nice thick rice noodles. The crabs were very fresh as well. Do make reservation as the queues are extremely Long.
5
This restaurant operates between 5 to 10pm. To get a table we need to queue for over an hour. The mud crabs were excellent and customers kept coming back to eat. There were other delicious foods on the menu. Staff were friendly.
3
Good food, but hard to enjoy food alone. most of dishes not for solo.
Crab noodle is exceed expectation. Topu as well. not easy to find but you can rely on taxi driver. Really a local food. In the midst of walls of aprtments.
5
The beehoon crab tastes so good, prices are reasonable. Services are good and quick respond. Cookings are also fast served as well. Kids love all the menus. Never forget to eat at mellben seafood while visits singapore.

If u are a visitor in Singapore n have tried allSorts of seafood, especially crabs, n if u had yet to visit Mellben, u would have missed out the best crab dishes in Asia.The queue to get a seat is v long n no booking or reservation can be made. No air conditioning but the range of seafood is great though I only go for its famous salty egg crab, black pepper crabs n bamboo clams! U will go away happy n satisfied but maybe a couple of hundred dollars lighter

My whole family love the chilli crab and the fried mantou. However the queue is super long. Waited 1.5 hours to be seated and another 15 minutes for the food to be served. Further more, you can only choose either 2 of the small size crab or 1 medium size crab to be cooked in your choice (like chilli crab). The staff is friendly. They brought out the actual crab to explain through size differen

Went to this crab restaurant on recommendation from locals. Have tried Mama kings and Jumbo seafood many times as benchmarks.Food felt more authentic and local and taste was great for all dishes, but the main attraction should be the crab.Ordered 3 types but the must signature order was crab in soup noddles. It tastes good. Maybe my expectation was too high as it wasn't awesome.Overall was tasty food but a couple of things let it down. Price, it's not cheap, I'm not expecting hawker food prices but the restaurant was hawker for the environment. it's not worth it. It's plastic table and chair open restaurant no air conditioning located in a middle of a HDB precinct.Food was good to very good but you can get the same in a much more comfortable setting for equal price.Worth at least a try as the locals say it's great but I feel better choices around for same price, similar food quality but significant more comfortable environment and location.Food: 4/5Service: 3/5Location: 2/5Ambiance: 2/5Price: 2/

We reached at 5:30pm on Sunday but already a long queue there. We had to queue for about 40 mins to get a seat, but definitely worth for it! The soup base is so rich, creamy and addictive! Crab meat is fresh and chunky. This restaurant is always on my must-go list whenever I come to Singapore.
2
Went here for dinner with my wife and long time friend. We made a booking and confirmed it by phone. When we arrived we had to order out in the street area, we had a 10 month old with us but hey who cares.The English is poor on everyone, in fact they speak better English in mainland China.The food was just ok. For the price I expected a lot better. Razor clams were cold, rice poorly cooked.We spent around $290 best thing going for this place is the cheap beer
5
absolutely loved their crab noodle in claypot, always so rich and sweet and the crabs are giangtic and firm. the dishes are consistently good throughout my last 5 visits. the tofu and spareribs in salty eggyolk was good but need big group to share as portion is huge.tried all their other crabs preparation and all good so really if you only have one evening for crabs i would go mellben instead of nsb or jb for better value and quality food...
4
A great place to go for crabs- where the locals go. Went down early at around 5pm - 5:30pm to ensure we get a seat and avoid the long queue. We were here again after so many times dining at Mellben Seafood Ang Mo Kio. The butter creamy crabs and crabs with noodles soup are my two favorite dishes here, but all crab dishes are soo yuummy.. They have 4 size of crab. The biggest one is 2-2.5kg each. The crab price was explained and agreed upon and our food and drinks orders takenThe atmosphere of the restaurant is only so so. Simple chair, table and no air con.The restaurant is quite far away from CBD. The nearest MRT station is Ang Mo Kio station, then change to bus line 166 or 169 to reach the place
5
No reservation. The crab noodles is a must for everyone. You can order noodles with soup extra. Cereal shrimp is also a nice try.
5
Very good food. The only thing is that there is no reservation. Need to have a friend to start queuing before the rest arrived.
4
My Singaporean friend brought us to this place by making reservation .We order Chilli crab with fried mantou, this was very good!! Chilli crab was flavorful and its sauce is delight taste when eating with mantou.And another one favorite dish is Salty egg yolk fried pork ribs. Salt &n sweet taste, fantastic dinner in Singapore. Now i'm craving for that 2 dishes already

Recommended by all my local singaporean friends. I went out to try mellben's famous crab in noodle soup.Quite nice. Worth a try. Side dishes were authentic and nice tasting. Also had the black pepper and Chilli crab. The setting was non aircond undercover. A bit hawker Like. This is what brought it back to 3 star rather than 4 star was with the price. It wasn't cheap and comparable to other famous Chilli crab restaurants like jumbo, and moma Kongs which give you indoor air cond proper table chair setting service.Price: 2 starsFood: 4 starsLocation: 2 starsService: 3 starsAs I said, worth a try but I don't see a desparate need to return again
5
Before leaving Singapore, my friend told my must try some chili crab! He was right! We ordered the traditional Singapore Chili Crab and a Garlic Ginger Crab. Both were outstanding. The entire meal was delicious. The service was fast, but we were on the early side - arrive before 6PM
5
After receiving a recommendation from a friend, we ventured out to the suburbs to sample Chilli Crab and we were not disappointed. After a short wait for a table, we were enthusiastically greeted and welcomed by a very helpful young lady. The crab price was explained and agreed upon and our food and drinks orders taken. After watching the fresh crabs being taken into the kitchen, our dishes arrived quickly and they were excellent. Chilli crab, special fried rice with dried fish, and a four treasures tofu and greens. Finished with a couple of large Tiger beers to round out a great night
4
We headed to Mellben Seafood using a taxi from the hotel. About $$12. Make sure to hand over to the driver the address.We order three crabs with some vegs. Chilli, Butter and Black Pepper. The Black Pepper won the table vote for the best crab.Great window at Mellben with several cooks at work. Would return
4
Went to the Ang Mo Kio Mellben Seafood Restaurant and had crabs cooked 3 ways; the chili crab, white pepper crab, and butter cream crab. They were all delicious, but we thought the white pepper crab had the best flavor. There were 6 of us and we had the crabs (two "normal sized" and one "medium sized" along with two vegetable dishes, 3 bowls of rice, a pork dish, and the fried chicken wings and it came to $60 SGD per person, which isn't too bad. The cost included a beer, two bottles of water, and two soft drinks, too. The fried chicken wings were really great; I highly recommend them! The only negative part of the meal was the waitress's attitude; she was surly and gave us attitude when we asked for a second menu (c'mon, there are SIX people at the table and you only want us to have ONE menu??). Anyway, maybe the crabs have gotten to her!If you go, get there early. They opened at 4:30 and we were there at 5:00; there was no line, but by 5:30, the line had about 20 people. By the time we left, there was a line around the corner of the building!Another thing is to be sure to take a peek at all the cooks as they're preparing the food. There's a big plate glass window where you can watch them at work and it's amazing to see them
4
We were here again after so many times dining here. The butter creamy crabs and crabs with noodles soup are my two favorite dishes here. Tonight they don't have big one, so have to go with the small one and cooked butter creamy. However, the taste was so good as we expected.Come before 5.30pm or after 8.30pm otherwise long queues even to get the table and another hour to get the crabs on the table
4
Best crabs in Singapore. They have regular and jumbo crabs, if you're here for crabs then splurge on the jumbo crabs albeit pricier. We had clay pot crab with bee hon and creamy butter shrimps, frogs, spare ribs and greens. All the dishes were very good. My favorite was the creamy butter shrimps and never tasted something like this before it's a balance of sweet, cheesy, buttery and savory all at the same time, we practically licked the dish clean. Be prepared for looonnnnggg queue and poor service but I'll still come back for the food.
3
Used to be a nice local, affordable place. It had a major facelift and now charges an arm and a leg for the same food. Sentimental value for me, but too crowded and overpriced now. Everything in Singapore seems to be.
5
The first time that you come here you will surprise with a big crab!!!!. OMG it born to be a big crab. They have 4 size of crab. The biggest one is 2-2.5kg each. The recommended menu is Chili crab for people who like a spicy, Creamy butter that perfect also. Chili sauce is perfect dipping with fired bun. It a perfect combination between hot&spicy and sweet&crispy&fluffy inside a bun. Tasty!!!!. You will not forget a taste of sauce that it didn't cover a taste of fresh crab. If you try a creamy butter, you will got a natural sweet from a crab with a good smell of butter. So hungry!!!, do you want to go like me?
5
we decided to come to this restaurant (we had read about it on TripAdvisor) as our usual Singapore seafood restaurant had, since our last visit a few years ago, become extremely expensive. This one, we'd heard would be half the price with good food. We weren't disappointed. Firstly, the clientele are mostly locale which was a good sign. The restaurant itself is quite traditional, open air with big round tables and stools. The food was fantastic. The chili crab excellent as was the steamed fish. Also, the price was very reasonableDefinitely worth a visit if you want something 'authentic'
4
A great place to go for crabs- where the locals go. Our favorites were the steamed fish, salt egg pork ribs, crab mee hon and white pepper crab. The fish and crabs were fresh, sweet and well prepared. Crabs can be ordered in different sizes to suit your appetite. Come early, especially during weekends to avoid a long wait. Service was good. We did not feel rushed, although there was a long line of people waiting to be seated. This place is worth a visit
5
No frills place but staff are helpful and polite. The crab bee hoon claypot is divine. Soup is sweet without being sickly. The chilli crab is tasty and the texture of the sauce is just right. The crabs are fresh with the meat falling off easily. Other dishes were ok. Been twice in two weeks with the family and planning another trip soon
5
Unlike the big chain seafood joints, Mellben is more of a secret to those who haven't grown up in Singapore. But I would rate their chilli crab as better than most others, and it's not even their strong point. The bee hoon crab and the butter crab are their specialities and well worth the long queues and the trek to AMK. Highly recommended for an authentic Singaporean experience

We went to the Toa Payoh Lor 8 branch on a Saturday night and we ordered chilli crabs. Service was bad enough as we waited very long for our tables despite making a reservation before. Finally we were led to our table and placed orders. Our chilli crabs were served, there was hardly any meat in that bowl of crabs. We searched and searched and ate a little, most of us didn't even had our own share of the crab meat. We called for the lady boss, who came out and argued that we should have asked for another serving and refused our request for refund. We only ate a few mouthfuls and there was already hardly any flesh left. The crabs were the problem, not us. The lady boss was pushing all blames to us. Excuse me, you are supposed to make sure every crab you serve are up to standard. In the end the lady boss even asked us: "Then how much do you think these crabs are worth?" In the end they gave us 30% off our meal. Service is bad, lady boss is rude. Don't ever waste your time visiting them. The crabs and the gravy were not even up to standard. No Signboard Seafood is so much way better
4
Mellben Seafood is well known for Bee hoon and chili crab. Been to this place several but it is always packed with long queue. Avoid weekend. Better make your way on weekdays.Must try! Despite a bit pricey but I would say worth it. Easy to reach this place by cab. If you like chicken. There is a Boon Tong Kee outlet on the opposite block

Brought my father to celebrate his birthday in this restaurant due to its good review. Reserved seats for 10 pax. And have to wait for 30 mins for food to serve. Not a issue. But what surprise us is, we have to go to counter to place our order. Then when food came, we are all shocked. We ordered big portion of salted egg prawn, came out to have 10 pathetic small-mid size of prawn. On top of that, the spring onion deer meat was a disappointment as well. Again, ordered big portion, and it came out to be very small portion that is enough for 5 pax to eat. Overall bill was very expensive. Will not come back again at all. Just my 2 cents comment from a local.
4
We dined at Mellben Seafood at 232 Ang Mo Kio HDB complex. Very famous with the locals. Long queues to get a table (took 1 hour plus) and long wait for the crabs reached our table (45 minutes). We ordered the signature crab dishes of this restaurant, the Crab Claypot Bee Hoon Soup and the Creamy Butter Crab. Both were very delicious. To get a lot faster service better arrived at 5pm or after 9.30pm. Anyway, those dishes are worth the wait.
4
Love the crab bee hoon soup. It's really tasty.
But the chilli crab is so so. Overall it's still good.
5
We tried the salted egg crab and it certainly didn't disappoint. I still crave it now and wish I could eat it all the time! Try and get down early otherwise you will have to queue for a while
3
2 large crabs at 276$. Good food but not exceptional. Nothing to 'Wow' about. Location not near mrt nor near any shopping, sightseeing sites.
4
When we arrived at 6:30pm on a Monday the place was full and the queue already sizeable. Diners are almost entirely local people, families and groups. We only waited 30-40 minutes before being led to a table, order already taken while we were queuing. We ordered two of Mellben's signature dishes, the Bee Hoon Crab Soup (very good) and deep fried tofu/bean curd (excellent).A little pricey but good food and a unique experience
4
My department decided to do a pre-cny dinner. Since the organiser has a craving for crab, we decided to go to Melbourne seafood, as it has the "best" crab (soup).We had a lot of people, and thus a lot of food. :)13 people, 8 crabs and miscellaneous others. So, of the 8 crabs, 2 are cooked with the bee hoon soup, which is really really good. The soup is good, the crab is tender and flavorful, and mixed with the noodles it is almost paradise on earth.The next best crab is butter crab. It's hot, rich, creamy and spiced with chills. It is also tender and flavored perfectly. We barbarians pretty much scooped the cream to dip our crab meat into.. We also had the chilli crab, which is not so fabulous in my books, as it is quite normal. It is quite spicy, so beware of the kick. The meat taste good when stripped of shells and mixed with the sauce. The least appetizing part for me, is the salted egg version. Our two were way over fried, with old, dry and stringy meat. The sauce is also pretty dry, and stuck onto the shell, which was disappointing. On the plus side, out of the 8 crabs, 4 had roe. Which is superb for us.The other food we had were tofu, vegetables - (I dont know what it is), fried sambal kangkong, as well as some pork ribs. I don't know if the food is worth the price, but I will not be willing to wait for the 2 hours for the food.. so my suggestion for people who love soup and crab and noodles.. book the place for a weekday dinner maybe 2 weeks earlier, and you will have a guaranteed seat
5
I did not see many tourists here like Jumbo but long queue of locals always. I read in some reviews that this place is expensive and the food is so so. If this is the case, why so many local people queuing up for it? One dish that you can't miss is their Crab Bee Hoon. It is the best in the World.I came last night with my friends from England, China and Taiwan. All of them loved it and this is their must come whenever they come to Singapore
5
The restaurant is quite far away from CBD. You have to take the MRT to Ang Mo Kio station and change to bus line to reach the place. But it is worthy of the effort. I love the signature chili crab here, especially with the buns. The place is crowded at night so be prepared to wait for a table
3
This place dines off its reputation, and prices don't seem in line with the food and experience. $180 for 2 crabs rice and a green, seems very excessive for a hawker environment.We ate at Jaan the day before for lunch with a 3 course fine dining lunch for around the same price. On what planet can these two experience be in the same price range.Don't get me wrong, food is ok, but not at that price
5
2nd time eating here, this time we Q here at around 6pm, still have a way to wait.Find something different for this restaurant, when I first came 2years ago, the staff are still using pencil and note to deal with the customer order, this time, they upgraded to IPAD to deal with every order, a good step.Back the point, we ordered 2 crabs, one for chili, one for creamy, Kang Kong, tofu, after we sat in our seats, we waited another 45 mins to be served the course. The flavour is still the same as we ate last time. It worth for a coming
4
Will go here every time when we visit Singapore. Their hot pot crab noodle is the best....the soup so yummy yummy so as the crab very sweet & tasty.We tried chili crab & very nice especially with the buns. We also tried their home made tofu, quite nice. Oatmeal shrimp....so so! Their fu Kwai chicken not very special, sauce too thick & salty. Overall, good to tr
5
Great service! Great food! Well worth the short wait. Staff are very friendly, quick, observant, and smiles on all. The food quality is excellent as usual.
5
Go early to avoid the queue and can get bigger crab with roe. Was given ticket to let u know the estimated wait time. Food is good! Especially the bee hoon crab soup. Order extra bee hoon...only 3 sgd.
4
Went there around 5pm to avoid dinner crowds. Had crab bee hoon and cereal prawns. Very fresh and meaty seafood. Quick service and reasonable price compares with other popular seafood restaurants. One down thing is too many flies if you eating outside.
4
long queue and waiting time but people are still going back. why? no doubt it is a little pricey but people still willing to patronise! not for the void deck seatings but for the great food they serve. highly recommend crab beehoon soup! love!
4
Was there with my family for dinner. Best is to reserve a table if you are planning to have dinner there. Or you may want to arrive as early as 5pm to queue so as to avoid the peak dinner crowd. We didn't try their crab dishes but other dishes. Not the best we have tried but still good. The staffs were friendly and nice too! Good service
5
Forget about calling to pre order. Just head down to order and wait to collect as the waitress candidly says they switch off the phone to avoid being overworked and overwhelmed. If you prefer to dine there go by 5pm to avoid huge crowd in the queque. Enjoy
5
This place already have so many reviews so I am just reviewing some of the dishes you should try while at Mellben. A must try is the Crabs noodle soup! This is the only place that have the dish. The soup is rich, the noodle texture is amazing, too!!! The chili crabs is great! Their other dishes are OK, not so excellent, but the crabs are great!! BTW, try to arrive early to avoid the long queue. Sometimes, you have to wait almost 2 hours to eat (1hrs in line, 30-45mins to prepare
4
Yes it is pricey. You're not paying for ambience but for the food.We tried the deep fried prawns, crab noodle, salted egg crab, the pork on ice, some veggies and beer. Everything tasted good. I usually don't like eating too much crab since its a lot of work but these crabs were meaty and yummy. 4 adults, all that food = about $300 US. We tried to make reso's but they weren't accepting reservations so we went around 6pm with our fingers crossed on a Monday and got a table right away. Location isn't convenient if your staying downtown (city centre) but with a taxi its about 15 min away
5
Every time I visit Singapore, I always wanna try crabs in this restaurant. Traditional chilli crabs, butter crabs, claypot crab bee hoon... are all very delicious. There was just a little concern that most of staff here use Chinese and we had a bit difficulty ordering in English. Anyway, we do not mind the long line waiting just for such amazing crabs
5
My first visit was more than 10 years ago, the whole place is now renovated and like the current ambience better. Like many reviewers have mentioned, we went down early at around 5pm - 5:30pm to ensure we get a seat and avoid the long queue.First time for me having Crab Beehoon Soup, very nice and gives you the heavenly feeling of total satisfaction. Also have the milky butter crab, there is also a must try.This is the only place that I visited twice during my month long trip back in Singapore July 2015. Thumbs up and literally finger licking good!!
5
The place is huge and clean. The crabs here are very mouth-watering. One of my favourite dishes is the butter crab. If i stay in spore always come here to get the crabs.
5
Great place for local fare in Singapore. You know it is good when locals stand outside in the heat for 1 hour in queue. Many versions of crab including Chili, Pepper and Butter. I will definitely return on my next trip! Worth the wait!!!
3
A friend recommended this restaurant in addition to the style of crab we should order; creamy butter, but unfortunately we left feeling underwhelmed and regretting not trying either one of the most popular choices (I.e. Bee hoon, salted egg, classic chilli).The crab itself was fresh and tasty but the butter sauce was too sweet for our liking and it was though we were eating some form of dessert crab.Will have to try one of the other sauces next time.Arrive by or before 6pm to ensure you get a table immediately and avoid the potentially long queues.Taxi fare was $14 from Marina Bay Sands but you could also take public transportation which will consist of one train and one bus fare
4
Went to the restaurant early at 5pm to avoid to the long queue. People were already arriving then. They do not accept reservation on weekends.The staffs were attentive and friendly. As my family were waiting for my in-laws to arrive, the staff politely took my order first and advise me to submit my order when my in-laws are due to reach, so that the food will be piping hot when everyone arrives.We waited a short while before the food were served. We were primarily there for the famous crab beehoon soup, but were pleasantly surprised by the pork ribs with salted egg yolks. These were not the puny ribs, but rather long and big ribs with tender and flavoursome meat. Fingers licking good. Quite shiok to eat the ribs using your hands.The crab beehoon soup was pricey as expected ($91 for a medium crab with 2 huge meaty pincers. Ordered extra soup $5 and extra beehoon $3). The soup is highly addictive and goes well with the beehoon. The crab is meaty and satisfying. I always order bigger portions than necessary because I know the restaurant will help to pack the left-overs - Great for supper while watching football
5
My friend recommended this place. We ordered the Chili crab and milky butter crab. It was very fresh, tasty and spicy (chill crab)! We ate with fried mantau and I have to say, this is the best place to eat crab in Singapore. We arrived at around 5:30 and got seated right away; but I noticed there is a very long queue after 6PM.
5
It's the best crab noodle in Singapore. For the last 3 years , when i am in Singapore , this will be my first restaurant. Soup crab noodle is top of the chart. Also there is cheesy crab and this time i tried their Mongolian pork chop ... it's delicious..But prepare for the wait.. and it's worth i
4
These are hands down the best crabs that we had tried in singapore. The styles were chosen by our local friend. We had the chilli crab, the salted egg crab and also the crab with noodles. The salted egg was my favourite style although the soup was amazing even if the crab did not have much taste. We waited for quite a while and the service is not the best. They also had an open kitchen where we could see the chefs whipping up the crabs which is awesome. May come back again if there is a shorter waiting time. 4 stars
4
Went on a weekday and we had a table almost immediately when we got there.Although the waiting time was mentioned to be an hour, the actual time was pretty fast even when we ordered the signature dishes.The crispy beancurd was pretty mediocre and so was the shark's fin soup.The venison did not taste anything like venison, instead it was close to beef. This came from someone who ate and love venison meat, and could easily differentiate the meat easily.The crab vermicelli soup was actually pretty good. The soup had the sweetness that came from the crab meat.The crab was really fresh.However, the dish could definitely tasted better if they had put in more vegetables in it.The milky buttery crab wasn't special and so was the deep fried buns(mantou) that came along with it.Had definitely tasted better elsewhere, but if you need and love the freshness of crabs, then this is the place due to their wide variety of cooking styles for crabs.Would definitely come again to try their other crab dishes and for the rice vermicelli crab soup which tasted really heavenly.Price was really costly, considering the location of the place and the non-air conditionED seating.But in view of the freshness of their crabs, this is often overlooked
3
Ordered 1 size crab bee hoon soup, one veg, one sweet and sour pork, one fried beancurd and drinks for 4 adults, total bill is $120+Queue for one hour and waited about 30mins for food. The crab bee hoon soup is too salty and the veg is overcook. Suggest to go their other outlets to eat rather than this
4
If you want to try all the different types of crab, you'd be hard pressed to locate one better with price point than Mellben as well as freshness admittedly the price has been going up but it remains competitive. Firstly if you have a chance to come with a mandarin speaker then bring them along for the ride as they only have maybe one or two in their ranks who can speak english. Personal must try is the butter crab which does a good job as well as adding some mantao to dip in the sauce, another one if you like soup then give the Crab bee hoon soup a go but the crab doesnt have any special flavour like the butter... Remember if you come around 5:30pm then you should be good for a table but any later then expect a queue as well as the food to table time takes a bit of time also..
5
Place is really spartan but the crabs are amazing!
Everytime i pass in singapore for sure i will eat crab here!
4
What you have to do here is wait, wait for a table (even if you book) and wait for your food. When the food comes it's good, but I've had far better in Singapore. We had a mixture of crabs and some other dishes. I wouldn't go out of my way to return to this restaurant
5
Mellben is located inside a public housing in a location called Ang Mo Kio which took us about 20mins to come from the town centre, but it's worth the hassle to come over as this is the best crab you could get. We ordered couple other meat dishes but nothing could compare with the 3 crab dishes we ordered. We ordered the chili crab, crab soup with noodle and black pepper crab. OMG. We ordered medium size for all 3 dishes and they were all meaty and cooked just right. Then the star of the show was the sauce, the chili sauce was super delicious, it's like a sweet and soup sauce but with a just right amount of chili in it, you could just eat the sauce with bowl after bowl of rice. It's just that good. Then the crab with soup noodle. My parent fell in love with the soup, it's creamy and full of the crab flavor. The rice noodle absorbs the savory soup and nobody could stop. This is just how good the crab dishes. Must come if you want good seafood in Singapore
4
If you come to Singapore and don't try all the crab dishes (Chili Crab, Noodle Crab Soup, Black Pepper Crab....) I am afraid you are not reached Singapore :) I tried Noodle Crab Soup at Mellben twice and would love to go back again. I love the crab smell and mild milky soup base. The restaurant is quite famous among local so reach there around 5:30pm on weekend and you won't regret... :)
5
Crabs were fantastic!! Had crabs in 2 different ways, white pepper and the bee hoon.White pepper was very flavourful, great combination of spiciness and flavourful crab. Crab was very meaty. We had a large one and it was about $90, which is pretty expensive (compared to having it at hawker center - like East Coast Lagoon), but definitely very tasty.the Crab Bee Hoon was really really special. The soup was fantastic!! very very rich in crab flavour! Definitely a must try!Adding a note on the service. The waitress was awesome, she keeps telling us to order less because the portions were quite large! And she was right! Very good service.Location is a bit out of the way! We took the MRT to Ang Mo Kio, then took the taxi which was about a $5 ride. But on the way home, it turns out there's a bus directly back to our hotel (IBIS bencoolen) with a stop right in front of hotel. Making it very very convenient
3
We had a nice mean of 2 crabs, one in curry and one in chilli. Both were nice (curry nicer) but we didn't found them very succulent, taste past the thick sauce was blend and not very exciting, besides we felt they also cost too much for the flavour. Never the less they went down with a couple of cold beers and overall we had a nice meal. Service level was good and although we were warned to wait up to an hour for our crab it arrived fairly quick
5
Be prepared to wait before you can enjoy yummy chili crab! Get there at least one hour earlier than your expected meal time. We waited total 2 hours including Q in the line and cooking time for our food. However it's really worth it. Thor those who like spicy, definitely you must order the chili crab, don't forget the "mantou" fried bun dip in the red spicy sauce, yum yu
4
This is one of my favourite places for a crab meal. The signature dish is claypot crab soup with vermicelli. The soup broth is very rich and tasty. My personal favourites are the signature dish and the salty egg crab.Salty egg crab is a fried dish and has great flavours. However, one should not expect perfect service. This is a place where one has to queue for 30mins to 1 hour before being able to get a seat and another 30 mins to 1hour to be served with the crabs. Personally, I feel that the queue is worthwhile. However, I will usually go pretty early (around 5 plus) to avoid the long queues. The main store at AMK has both air conditioned as well as outdoor seats
4
Instead of going for dinner to the East Coast I was redirect by a very nice lady from Singapore to this restaurant where locals go to enjoy famous chili crab.Simple and clean place, owner very nice suggesting the right size crab for our group without overloading us with food and $$$!!Very pleasant experience to be repeated with friends and guests coming to Singapore!Thank you Irene

After two times of failure in Singaporean signature dish-Chilly crab in Jumbo, I deicide to explore more local restaurant. (Not bc they provide bad food but pepper crab and chilly crab they provide were just not my style. I love more Thai-Korean kind of spiciness) To cut the chase, Mellben Seafood is a local hawker center. No view, no good service. We had to wait for 1hr (no exaggeration) and another 1hr until our foods came out. The table was not that clean. I kind regretted that I decided to have dinner here. But, when the food was served...I was so satisfied and thought it was so worth of my time. Crab was smaller, but the price was generous. (Half price) we ordered Pepper crab with noodle and some other 3-4 dishes such as veges, PP...etc. the pepper crab was not greasy, the pepper+oyster sauce was appetizing. The other dishes were all pretty good too. We destroyed everything and walked out so satisfied.I wont recommend if you look for a place for special occasions that are clean and provide good services. This place is recommendable for those who look for more local delight at a very reasonable price. Just don't forget to book a week before to save up ur time!

I used to love to go to mellben seafood but their food quality and service standards especially have declined over the years. The staff were extremely rude.
1
The china waitresses have very terrible attitude and service. They keep letting the singaporeans wait and let all the china people behind us in the queue go first. When we asked why they just ignored us. Melben seafood get it together and fire these imbeciles.
4
The price would be nicer than other famous restaurants, and the quality of crab is such good! One tips, if you forget booking, don't worry, you can choose to take-away.

What makes a good day end? To have a good crab meal with close friends... loved their salted egg and chilli crab.. i will travel from raffles to satisfy my crab cravings

Went to Mellben Seafood with my family on last Sat. Ordered their signature crab bee hoon soup, chilli crab and butter crab. Besides these, also had Hong Kong style steam soon hock fish, stir fried broccoli, deep fried toufu, sweet and sour pork rib. The PRC waiter who took the order was very attentive to our needs. He would ask how many pax we had and recommend the quantity of the food. He also informed us of the estimated size of each big and small crab so that we can decide the type we want for each crab dish. The crab never fail to satisfy our craving. They were very fresh and meaty. My son who loves chilli crab had an enjoyable dinner. It was definitely value for money
5
The signature crab bee hoon dish never fail to delight. Only drawback is that the re filled soup which we have to pay for, isn't as good as the first round. Other ways of cooking worth trying : The crab with salted egg yolk, butter crab which is rich and cream and the curry crab is yummy to go with hot buns!
5
We ordered the crab bee hoon with extra noodles and extra soup. Best for kids who are not used to the spicy crabs (chilli and pepper). The fried dough balls are excellent as is the fried tofu. SGD80 - SGD100 per crab. But worth every penny
5
Booked the restaurant earlier in the week otherwise the queue is crazy. Mainly locals go here, place ain't fancy, Chinese waiters who can't speak English but food was amazing. Ordered, 1 chilli crab, 1 black pepper crab, 1 crab noodle in clay pot and prawns. Together with 2 beers and 2 soft drinks, came to $210. Highly recommended.
4
The 2 things that are good about restaurant is the price and quality of the food, especially Chili Crab.The place is less expensive, comparing to other restaurant who served Chili Crab. Whle the crab is very big, thick, spicy and slightly sweet chilli sauce is awesome. You can eat it with rice or mantau. Be ready to get your hands dirty. It's like in KFC, finger lickin' good :).Beside the chilli crab, the marbled goby is also good.The atmosphere of the restaurant is only so so. Simple chair, table and no air con.There're no MRT station near the restaurant, so you can take bus or taxi to get here.The servants speak little English, but fortunately the menu is supported by picture and in English, so you can point the dishes that you want

This is the restaurant we chose for Singapore chili crab, and we weren't disappointed. We went on a Friday night and the que looked long, but we ordered in the que and were seated pretty quickly. We were the only tourists in the place, which was a good sign. The servers don't speak English. We asked for water, and our server couldn't understand. After he left our table, we found Dasani on the menu, so pointed to it when he returned. We ordered Crab Bee Hoon Soup, Mantou, and Chili Crab. It was plenty for 3 of us. Our female crabs didn't have much meat, so I might suggest ordering male. As others have stated, the food takes awhile (more than 30 minutes), and it is EXTREMELY messy to eat. However, it was so so good! Authentic experience
5
The 2 kg butter crab is awesome. The crab is fresh, meat is sweet and tender. Better come early to avoid long queue. Price is quite expensive. 2 kg butter crab is about sing $200,-

Wanted to give overseas relatives who came to visit a taste of Singapore famous chilli crab. The wife decided on Mellben after reading the online reviews. (Our first time too).We went on Thursday evening around 6:30 pm. We were worried that we will have to queue but our worry was unfounded. We immediately got a table for our group of 7. We only saw a queue after 7 pm but turnover rate is quite fast since most people will leave once they are done with their feast.Below is our order:1. Their special beancurd (nothing special)2. Crab bee hoon soup (their signature dish. Not spicy. Simply delicious. Suitable for kids. A must order)3. Chilli crab (strong ketchup taste, slightly sweet & spicy. Lots of sauce for the mantou/rice. Kinda boring actually)4. Butter crab (absolutely delicious. The wife fav dish. Not spicy and the curry leaves add the extra oomph. Taste remind me of cereal prawn)5. Mantou & white rice to mop up the sauces.The damage is $216 which is quite reasonable. (Crabs are expensive in Singapore).The crabs are huge & meaty but a tad overcooked. We made the mistake of ordering all female crabs. Too much crab roe is not a good thing (some people dont like the strong taste). I heard the male crab has more meat so we will mix it up next time.There are restrooms/hand wash station available so dont be afraid to eat with your hands (best way to eat crab really).Tips:- Go early & on weekday if you wish to avoid the crowd/queue.- expect at least 30 mins wait for the food.- order extra soup for the crab beehoon soup.- eat with your hand.- due to time consuming nature of eating crab, may want to finish up the soup first before it turn cold.- dont wear white clothing. Eating crab is a messy affair.Enjoy your feast :-

Ordered the crab beehoon with soup. It was ..oh my god yummy-li-cious. The taste of the wonderful soup and the juicy yet tender crab and the gentle laksa noodles with lots lots of ref chillies make it a worthwhile wait for the food.Coming to waiting, I went there with my wife at 5 pm on a Saturday. We were seated by 5.30, and food only arrived at 6.15. By then the queue was so long I really pity those at the back...will probably have to wait till 9 to makan. My advice - go and queue at 4.15pm. The place opens at 4.3
5
First time to dine at this restaurant that was highly recommended by my Singaporean friends. Though they have some other branches, this branch at Ang Mo Kio is still the best - as per my friends. We're lucky to be able to book a table there at 6pm. :)As planned, we ordered 'must eat' dishes:' crab' in soup and 'rice noodles'; chilli crab + deep fried buns, prawns in salted egg yolk, spicy fried morning glories vegetables, deep fried squid, steamed fish, fried noodles (for my friend's birthday), all so yummy, and must come back again!!! Price is not expensive at all, of course it's far more cheaper than Newton Square or No signboard ..etc.Must try
4
Thanks to my fren for bringing us to this crab restaurant. Although we have to wait for more than 1 hour (inc queeing n waiting the crab to b served), but the waiting is worth because the crab is super delicious, you will eat non stop until you feel full. The crab bee Hoon n chilli crab ( must order the bun also) are the must try food here...
5
Some locals took us here and it was an excellent dinner unlike a traditional restaurant that caters to western visitors. First, it is an informal open-air restaurant with plastic chairs and cheap utensils and no napkins to wipe your mouth or hands. It looked like most guests were local Chinese families – that’s what I mean by “authentic local.” The chili crab, which apparently one of their specialties, was outstanding. We had a number of other dishes that our host ordered that were also excellent, especially the one that was like a crab soup with noodles. Highly recommended even though it is a 30-40 min drive from the heart of the city. 200 SGD for 4 people
5
When we reach there about 6pm and there already a long-Q. This really surprise me and luckily my another gang of friends get the table before we arrived. We have ordered 3 different taste of crabs, BeeHoon Crab-the soup really tasty, Salted-Egg Crab-is my favorite and never disappoint me, Butter Crab-still tasty. Those crabs really big and fresh.From what my friends told me, you must reach there before 5pm to queue up, then you manage to eat the 1st batch and get to eat the big crabs
5
One word to describe this restaurant: awesome. Thanks to a local on CS, he took us to this amazing place and enjoy all the best food in this word. We tried many dishes but my most favorite dish was Chilli Crab, it was delectable and tasty. This will be in my must-try food list in Singapore and if someone ask me for advices I would recommend this restaurant immediately
4
We arrived at the restaurant about 8pm and there was a super long queue that went around the restaurant. We queued for an hour before we got a table and waited for another half an hour before the food arrived. While queueing, the waiter came around giving everyone menus and took our orders after that. There were many varieties of crab dishes, but we were told that the minimum number of crab per dish is two pieces. We only managed to try one dish since there were only 5 of us. We ordered the chilli crab with some side dishes and deep fried buns. It was awesome and we all loved it. If you intend to try this seafood restaurant, I would advice you to have a late lunch or afternoon snack and arrive there after 9:30pm for a late dinner. There was no queue after 9:30pm and you could get serve almost immediately
5
To start with I am not a big fan of crabs. But I can't help giving a big thumbs up to this restaurant. Not only were the crabs extremely delicious (my family of 5 can't take much spicy hot stuff so for crab dishes we only ordered crab beehoon and butter crab, which were both excellent even for non-spicy food consumers), the pricing was also very reasonable (at around S$60 per kg) and service efficient. We went there at 6:15pm on a Monday and there was no queue, but then it really started getting crowded by around 7pm. Order was placed almost immediately after I chose the crabs, and they showed me the exact amount (less drinks) I was going to pay - a good way to avoid argument over the size and portion. Pls also note they only take food order once, i.e. can't add dishes (I think to avoid people lingering at the table pondering about what to order next). So you'd better make up your mind early. Highly recommended
4
The main star are the crabs, whether it chilli, claypot or butter.
Crabs are big ans fresh.
Queue are crazily long and service not fast enough.
4
definitely one of the best chili crab in singapore... The chili crab was great, the crab was really fresh, the shell are soft enough to break by hand, the soup one i think too much seasoning... A little bit pricey but worth it...
5
the Crab Been Hoon is a must try in this restaurant, the best in singapore. Order a Medium Crab, around 60SGD, it is big and fresh. If you have more than 2 person, you can order addtional Been Hoon and soup, so that you can refill the claypot. If you want to avoid the Quene, please arrive before 5pm, so that you will be at the first batch. The easier way to go is take MRT to Ang Mo Kio then take a cab for 5 mins ride. I go there just for the crab, other dishes are normal only. Must try if you come to singapore
5
Had dinner with my family ... First time for us all. We ordered butter crab, crab with soup noodles, deep fried rib with salty egg, prawns and veg. We were all very impressed by the food served. its the best among the famous seafood restaurants in Singapore! :
5
If you don't come here around 16:30 to queue up, sometimes you'd need to wait for 30-45 minutes. The dishes here will not let you down, especially the crab beehoon and butter crab, these two are the must-try dishes. Will always come back and dine here whenever I am back to Singapore
5
We were taken to this restaurant by local Singaporean friends for chilli crab as it was on my "must eat" while in Singapore list. It was THE BEST chilli crab I have ever had. I would go back to Singapore just to eat this again. Definitly get there early though if you don't have a reservation as the word is out about this place and you'll wait a while for a table otherwise. Suggest you get a local Tiger beer to go with the crab. Heaven
4
My first bite into the "salted egg deep fried crab" was heavenly. I never had tasted such a delight. Definitely worth the visit, but for me probably not too often, because it's kind of expensive. We paid about $90 $ing for a dish. My friends in Singapore said that this place is so famous, that they can charge that kind of prices. I recommend you to go and taste the Chilli Crab and the Butter Crab....yummmm....doused it with tiger beer. Enjo
4
We came early to miss the wait. Crab was large and full of meat. Very busy restaurant with lots of locals. You pay extra for AC and extra for less ice in drinks. And you have to pay for the items that they put on your table
3
Be prepared to wait if you want to eat their crabs. also, to be in queue at least before 6pm if you going for dinner to avoid aching your poor legs for too long. i realise they have VIP arrangements, probably you gotta patronise frequently until they recognise you so that you can skip the queue(at least 30 mins) and food are served in less than 30mins(the usual waiting time for food is est 45mins and above)
4
Being allergic to shellfish, I usually stay sway from prawns/crabs/oysters alike. Offlate I found out that I could eat crab, without a big allergy backfire.The place was a pleasant surprise. We were taken here by a local colleague who sweared by the crabs at the place. We were a mixed group of koreans/singaporeans/indonesians/indian/australian. The mix ensured that we get a big order and variety, spanning across the menu.The place does not have AC, but has both inside and outside seating. There are no bibs provided but has tongs to break crabs. The crabs (both red and white curry) are excellent in quality and quantity and taste. We also ate chicken, prawns and 2 veg salads (spice and moderate) - both were excellent. Restaurant also serves a decent collection of beers, fruit juices and mixes.Overall a must visit for crab lovers and I will definitely visit again
4
Nothing much to say. Good food. No regret. Nothing much to say. Good food. No regret. Nothing much to say. Good food. No regret.
5
My son loves the soup and beehoon! The bad thing is that you have to always queue and avg waiting time of 40 minutes. Try to arrive early and order first! Crab Beehoon, their playboy chicken is worth the time!
5
Make sure you book for this super popular Chili Crab restaurant in a very out of the way place!
Calamansi lime juice and Chili Crab and wow it was good!
The wall of Crabs is cooll for a pic or two also!

I was at the restaurant this evening at about 23 Feb, 5:20 pm. By 5:30 pm, we had gotten a table and gave our orders. We waited till 6:25 pm before being served. We ordered chilli crab, fried bun, steamed herbal chicken, yam basket, mongolian ribs, claypot mixed veg with bean curd and some seafood/roast pork. Was most disappointed that the food were not hot when served. Worst is the steamed herbal chicken. When served, the bottom was warm but the top of alum foil is simply cold. We told the waiter who told us that it is 'hot' touching the bottom of course. The rice also was not too hot. I could see that it is was turned over as if from one bowl to another. The claypot came with 2 pieces of fatty roast pork with mostly white cabbage. Mongolian ribs has only meat not ribs. The bun came first before 10 minutes later of the crabs. I asked for a change of the bun as they were cold then. The crab was good but very expensive considering for a medium sized crab at $71.50. During settling of bill, informed the boss but he said we should have feedback to him personally. He opened up the steamer and said very hot. Of course after we have finished our meal and more than 45 minutes later. Looks like they could have the food cooked ready but not served to us until all together at 6:25pm.It is not worth the visit for the arrogant staff and such indifferent boss
4
Went for dinner in December at 5pm when it was not busy yet. The crab beehoon with thick noodles tasted delicious- the broth was cooked nicely. The prawn mango cocktails was also very nicely presented in glasses and crunchy at the right texture.The drinks could do with improvement though. The "homemade barley" definitely from a can and way too sweet and overpriced.Will definitely go back again
4
headed over to the restaurant at 7pm, was seated by 7.20pm. food was to arrive within 1 hour. it was quite a wait (esp if you're hungry!) but the wait was worth it. we had chilli crab (medium), crab bee hoon soup (small) and 1 serving of mantous (10 mantous in 1 serving) for 3 person. we were all so full after the meal!! the crabs were fresh and juicy. the soup was so flavourful! love the mantous when dipped into the chilli gravy.. enjoyed my experience and definitely lived up to the hype. the staff were also friendly, helpful and efficient
4
Recently had the chance to eat at Mellben on a Sunday night and the wait was about an hour long when my group arrived at around 7:30pm. The staff tried its best to speed along the experience by taking orders in line. My group ordered the crab beehoon, mongolian shrimp, kangkong, stewed tofu, and the playboy chicken. Dishes trickled in as soon as we sat down with the crab served as the final dish. The wait staff checked up on the table multiple times and followed-up on drink orders (even reasonably priced beers!). The food quality was excellent and service was good for a casual outdoor dining spot. The value here is price compared to its competitors (Jumbo, Long Beach, and No Signboard). Granted the other establishments are more formal and business friendly (e.g. reservations accepted), if you have the time to wait in line for an authentic Singaporean crab meal, you'll only pay about half of what they charge at the other places. I'll be coming back
4
This was my second time there and the Mongolian ribs were still as good. Of course, it wouldn't be a complete meal without crabs at Mellben, so we just had to order some. Actually, it was just one this time, as the creamy butter crab we got was really fat and juicy with loads of roe. It's $55/kg, and I thought it was reasonable. The ribs were well worth their $15 price tag (small serving). I thought it's always customary to have a bowl of lemon juice at the table for the washing of hands, but that tradition might have died aeons ago, since it really had been a long time. The washrooms are convenient and clean, so there's no worrying about messy hands. Wet wipes (pay as you use) helped, but I guess there is nothing like lemon to dissipate the smell/aroma.It is true that the service might be a little strange to the uninitiated, and we wonder why we had to go to the counter to place our orders while they did take the trouble to take our drink orders. The food servers were interestingly emotionless, but that's fine. We're not here for the show. Anyhow, the cleaners at the tables were really quick at the end of the whole meal. Full marks for efficiency here
4
It was my first time to Mellben and definitely not my last. When we arrived at 5.50pm on a Sunday evening there was already a queue in front. However, before long we were seated. But while we were still on queue, we were given the menu and orders were taken. The restaurant was packed. The seafood was very good. The crab in beehoon soup, butter crab, chili crab, salted egg yoke shrimps, steamed asem garoupa, fried tofu and kangkung belacan were all very good. The crabs have a lot of meat in them and were very fresh. The garoupa and shrimps were also very fresh. However, we were surprised at the "playboy chicken" which we ordered for our young kids. The picture in the menu which my son picked out shows a plate of fried chicken cutlet. When the dish came, there was a tangy spicy sauce smothered over the fried chicken. For adults it would not be an issue and in fact tasted great when we dipped the fried tofu into it. But our kids could not eat the spicy chicken. Mellben should be more careful with the photos on its menu and should not deviate from what is shown. It became a dilemma for us because to order another "playboy chicken" would be too long of a wait and yet our kids, which were hungry by now, could not eat it. We thought of a solution and that was to dunk the chicken into a cup of hot water to remove the spicy sauce. We asked for a glass of hot water but it took them at least ten minutes to bring it!!Service was very bad. The waiters and waitresses are constantly too busy to serve guests other then to take orders. So one can forget about asking for anything besides ordering food or drinks. One good point Mellben has is when one finishes with the food order, they will write down the approximate time the food will served. Price is reasonable and maybe cheaper then Eastcoast seafood restaurants. The Ang Mo Kio restaurant has no aircon.Suggestion: Come for the food but not the service and go before 6pm before the queue gets too long. Communication could be an issue when ordering if one does not speak Mandarin. Very few waiters/waitresses speak English. The restaurant do not take reservation on weekends and public holidays
2
We went as a group of university students of around 10. As we didn't book the table we had to wait around 45 minutes for a table to become available - In the queue we had to place the order in advance. The menu does not show any prices, and when asked the server said it depends.Once we did get a table the food arrived pretty quickly, and is of the standard expected. Serving sizes are okay, as is the service.The surprise came at the end, when the bill arrived. We were told that it would be around $25 per person, but the bill arrived at closer to $35. On that basis, even though the food was not too bad, the wait and the price made it a 2 out of 5.Would be suited to tourists, but is a bit out of place - if you are looking for chilli crab there are better quality restaurants (with better food/service for a similar price) at Clarke Qua
4
Crabs are firm with bite. Sauce are great. Price is in the middle of resturants/hotels and other coffeeshop/hawker food. The shimmery crabs are a must try. Can see hdb (typical housing of the average Singaporean) if you are a tourist.
4
Just love the crab bee-hoon and black pepper crabs. A bit difficult to find parking but worth the 1hr45mins wait for table and food to be served;)
4
we had a booking for 6pm on a Friday night and our table was ready but by 7pm the queue was at least fifty long and that was only for taking orders! It can be a long wait.The food however is very good and lives up to its reputation. It is best, however, to stick to the seafood as the spare ribs were fatty and oily. The crab bee hoon is excellent and the fried prawns were succulent and juicy.The restaurant can get very noisy and with a large crowd it is also quite stuffy. Parking can also be problematic as the nearby car park fills up quickly
4
Located at the corner of the HDB estate in Ang Mo Kio Ave 3, this seafood restaurant has some of the best business in Singapore. There is always a long queue and at least a 40 min to an hour's waiting time to get your food, so be sure to know exactly what you want and the amount you want. The last time I was here, I ordered the pork ribs with salted egg, chili crab, butter sauce crab, black pepper crab with tanghoon and the crab beehoon soup; all of which were really tasty and pretty satisfying. I would return again but not so quickly because the waiting time is really a turn off, but if you're willing to wait, this place can be quite a trea
5
must try, but a long wait - must eat the crab bee hoon soup (not sure if this name is correct) but its the crab soup noodle thing. super good..this is the only thing i miss the most from singapore that i can't have anywhere else. no air con so it may be a bit hot..but its worth it.
4
Only complain is the accessibility of the place otherwise would be perfect! The consistency is always there even though I have been there for many times over the years. That is something quite admirable.Ordered the usual suspects - Chill Crab (small) and Crab Beehoon (small). Total was $104 for both dishes. I like the chilli gravy, enough spicy kick and egg that made you want to drink everything up.Had also the kangkong sambal ($10), claypot beancurd ($12) which the gravy was nicely flavoured and Soon Hock with Chye Po ($55) which was really fresh.Service was fast and polite. We reached at 5.30pm and there was a queue just because they take your order first before you seat. As long as you are in their first dinner seating, you dont need to wait that long
4
Our family recently was taken by some friends to the Ave 3 location for dinner. The Mellben is known for their pepper and chili crabs and we were fortunate that our hosts had made dinner reservations in advance. The atmosphere was something that one would expect as the majority of guests were locals from the surrounding government housing complex. Great local food and I would definitely come back again
4
Better than No Reservation or Long Beach. Need I say more? Worth the 1.5 hours wait. It Akers another 45 minutes to wait or your order to be served. Didn't get to try their crab in claypot since there were only 3 of us but if you're a group of 5 should be a must
4
If you love crab... ESP bee hoon claypotwith crab. Then this is the place.Price is not cheap but I still go there because I will miss it.Before I travel overseas or when I return from a trip. I will date my friends for a crab session.Recommendation1 bee hoon claypot with crab2 chilli crabDon't go for salted egg crab, they are not good in that.If u don't want to queue too long, go there before 5.30pm. Or just call to order takeaway.At the moment per kg crab is around $48. Go for size/weight around 1.2-1.5kg male crab for fatter meat
3
We had to wait in line for about an hour to get a table as they do not take reservations. The food was good when it came. We ordered steamed soon hock fish with fried salted vegetables, and it was very fresh and good. This was followed by tofu with floss, pork ribs fried with salted egg, chilli kangkong, and fried buns with chilli crab. The service was quick and attentive, even with the crowds
1
We were looking forward to having our dinner at Mellben Seafood after reading much good reviews. We ordered a deep fried beancurd dish and to our horror our 7 yr old discovered a worm in it. We alerted the waitress and she took the dish away without any apology.. She came back and said will cancel off this dish from our order. Dissatisfied I again feedback our dismay to the cashier upon payment. What was shocking was her reply... She angrily replied 'we already cancelled off this dish from your order what more you want??' We were really disappointed with her attitude and service! We feel that this restaurant is indeed over rated and the prices exhorbitant. Will never patronized this terrible food outlet again
4
Yes, the crabs were juicy, fresh and big. Fall in love with their crabs but too lazy to queue, ya I have queue for almost 45mins and waited for another 45mins for our dishes, but worth the queue and was told that the reservation needs to be made 1 week in advance. I drove there and parking not too hard to find since there is a open air car park just in front of it, and it was not too hard to be found by my cousin from Hong Kong by taxi from the nearest MRT station , Ang Mo Kio
5
I'm a seafood + crabs lover. Been to this restaurant few times and in loves with it every time. Love the big crabs size, love the preparation. Expect a super long Que if you plan to have your dinner there over the weekend. A must try for everyone
5
in all my life so far i had never tasted such a big juicy tasty big crab,for the first time that i had tried it back in 2 years ago.every around four to five months ,i will go back there with my friends to eat it again.as far as crab concern,this is the best crab and fast service hereof course the price here might be kinda more expensive,but it really offer-able compare with the size you eating with the size that you had paidyou will never regret about i

We took our local friends advice to go to this restaurant when we visited Singapore. The first impression wasn't that good because they didn't let us sit down at our table even when the restaurant was still quite empty in the early hours. We were asked to order food first before they allowed us to sit down. The food was good and with the local setting, the price is not too expensive. However service wasn't that good especially when the place was busy, we simply didn't get much service after all our order of food was served. The staff who was responsible for taking order of drinks often missed our order and wasn't very polite. Overall the food was fresh and the flavors were pretty good. However given the location which is quite far away from the center of the city and no reservation accepted, we probably would not choose to go back again in the future. There are many more other good restaurants sever as good food at similar price in other more convenient locations
4
We didn't have to wait that long a Q, but the wait for food ordering took awhile and the food came in 45 mins later. We order the Chilli Crab with some fried buns. It was very delicious. We also order the Clay Pot Bee Hoon Soup, it was Awesome.... as we left, there were still people queueing.
2
Been here twice....both times I have found the fare here over-rated and definitely over priced. The food is decent but nothing to rave about, definitely not worth the inflated prices and not worth having to queue up for, especially in the hot humid weather. Think it all comes down to the herd mentality..if there's a queue, it must be good way of thinking. If really needs be, go to No Signboard Seafood in Geylang. Or better still, board a taxi at random, and ask the driver...cab drivers are the best to ask for food recommendations. Anyway, if you are in the queue here at Melben and get fed up of waiting, traipse to the coffee shop at the other end of the block...and try the kwai chap....stewed pig innards...excellent, especially go in the mornings, when the scrawny ancient Chinese man is there...he's the boss and would have been there since midnight to prepare the day's kwa chap

After a long day of theme park hopping, my family and i decided to try the very popular Mellben Seafood restaurant at Ang Mo Kio. It was a weekday and yet the line was still so long even at 830 in the evening. We waited for an hour and a half and were told that as soon as we sit down, we would have to wait for another hour for our order. Since that was the only night that we had available for that restaurant, we patiently just waited. To make the long line story short, we ordered thir butter crabs and beehoon crab soup. Both were really good but the butter crab stood out especially when you dip your fried mantou in it. Service was actually good as soon as you sit down. Fortunately we only waited for our foor to arrive for about 20 minutes. Will I still line up for an hour and a half for it? NO. I'd rather order take away, pick it up and eat it at the nearby hawker center :P It's just crazy to line up that long for a crab. It was really good but the line is not worth it. REALLY
4
My local friend suggested this place. No regret with the long Q as the food is awesome. We ordered the Big Sri Lankan crab to be cooked in Buttercream and Claypot Meehoon soup. Thumbs up....Must tried their fried bun, goes well with the buttercream sauce. Go early to avoid long Q especially during weekend
4
Unbeatable crab with solid meat, as well as other impressive dishes. We two ordered Crab(stirred fried with Salty egg and cheese), Curry Pork Chop and Golden Bean Curd. Can't say anything on the crab, coz we both are busy with eating. Surprisingly the Curry Pork chop is awesome: Tender as chicken, with rich and tasty gravy. OMG, we paid SGD45 per person for all this that we can't finish and we are so satisfied. The quality and taste is impressive. Proper dollar value.BTW, the crab is SGD55 per KG in my visit

Check out some blogs on Singapore food and you'll be bewildered. Melben Seafood is good for its price. Love the fried buns.
4
Love how the flavours seep in to the soup, and how savoury it is. Only drawback: the noodles are slippery and always want to escape the scoop.
5
Went to their branch at Toa Payoh area. The Claypot Crab with Beehoon and Guinness Pork Ribs are highly recommended. Do come early as it gets really crowded
4
My friends came to visit me so we went to Mellben since it's very famous to the locals. The must taste dish is Chilli crab and Black pepper crab and some other crab but i didnt remember. We order the 2 mentioned crab above for 3 ppl and the food was very delicious. Though everyone says Chilli crab but I prefer Black pepper crab since the chilli crab is too sweet for m

Exceptional freshness of crabs with solid meat and different sizes! The Butter crab and crab claypot bee hoon are definitely the best dishes. Also available are other seafood, meats and vegetables, but you would be better off saving space for the crabs.The waitress informs you the estimate price after you place the order. Perhaps to prepare you in advance because the prices are not cheap (especially for the location) and you might be a little surprised. Do arrive before 6pm to beat the crowds. And make sure that the majority of your party have arrived otherwise you won't get seated till they do! Staff are mainly PRC who don't speak English so non-mandarin speakers could have a harder time

If you like crab noodle then this is it. The crab taste perfect when taken with the noodle & coconut milk. Beside, you can also try their signature dish which is not on their menu. It's the salted egg yoke pork ribs and the steam fish with preserved radish. It sure worth the money you spend even though its in a coffee shop setting. Oh, don't bother the other branch in Toa Payoh. This one at Ang Mo Kio beat it hands down!!

I have been to this restaurant for many years and the crab is definitely among the best in Singapore. The husband & wife owners initially rented a stall in this coffee-shop. They moved from another location and the crowd simply followed. Subsequently they bought over the whole property and converted it into a non-air-conditioned seafood restaurant. Many contributors complained about the long queue but isn’t that expected of a hugely popular crab restaurant? Also, the service isn’t tip-top but it is adequate. Having said that, there are some strategies to fully enjoy Mellben.Firstly, you can actually call to make reservation from Monday to Thursday so you don't have to wait. These are also the less crowded days but still, don’t be surprised to see a long queue. Unsurprisingly, the crowd is worst on Friday, Saturday and Sunday but if you really want to, plan to go early before 5:45pm or after 8:30pm otherwise be prepared to wait hours! Another option is to order take-away. Just call to place your order & they will call you to collect your food. Then enjoy at home.Secondly, as you wait in line, the staff will take your order and you need to get it right as you cannot order additional items later. The staff is mainly Mandarin-speaking but if you need translation, simply ask the people next to you in line. People in Singapore are generally helpful, just ask politely. Moreover, the menu has photographs.Thirdly, once you have ordered, wait till you are ushered to your table to... wait again for the food to be served. You can now order the drinks, corkage applies for BYOs and the bill is added to the food. All payable by cash or credit card. Lastly, the dishes I would highly recommend are: (1) appetizer – Sea Asparagus in Thai sauce; (2) bamboo clams; (3) steamed fish & of course (4) crab with beehoon. The crab comes in 3 sizes (Small, Medium & Large), do check the price with the staff. Male crabs are usually larger but females come with roe. The waiter/waitress is very good at estimating the quantity for the number of your party so trust their recommendation with regards to the size and number of crabs. He/she will also advise additional beehoon & soup if required. The other ‘unauthorised’ Mellben outlet is located at Blk 211 Lorong 8, Toa Payoh which is less crowded, probably due to lower food quality. As this outlet belongs to the owners' brother, they do not bother to shut it down. I have posted some photographs. Enjoy

Lines are always long and they rarely accept reservations. We were there 6pm and the place is already full. But definitely worth the wait! Crab beehon! Crab beehon! Crab beehon! Our visit to singapore is never complete without eating at this resto. The place is a bit off the urban area and might be difficult for the taxis to find so its best to bring your own map and address. The place is not air conditioned as it is just under a housing unit
2
Sometimes you may wonder "is it the business is so good that the customer service dont matter anymore?". Honestly, it is only the crabs that are good, other dishes are of no special mention needed. AS no reservation is accepted during weekend, be expected to wait at least 30 mins for the Queue.
5
I've eaten there for 3 times in a year. I've had their chili crab, curry paste crab, and claypot crab bee hoon soup. Their claypot crab bee hoon soup is the best, and definitely a must try! That's the dish I'd give an excellent comment! Myself like crab roe, so I always order female crabs there. One thing needs to bear in mind is this store is well known by locals, and there's always a long queue, and waiting time after ordering may take an hour or longer. So come early or make reservations beforehand
3
Food is overpriced, queues are long and staff are rude. There is a queue every evening , however I feel there are far better choices more value for money. Think twice before going there
4
butter crab is a must! even my frens from italy love it! great service at the east coast park outlet too! love it! :)
5
East Coast branch
(-) Location is rather secluded and quite on a weekday. No tissues provided.
(+) Attentive staff. Huge crabs, very fresh and tasty. Such a feast! We had the claypot beehoon crab, chilli crab and pork ribs with egg yolk. Yum!
4
this place is well patronized by locals and celebrities .. very fragrant crabs .. check out their chilli, pepper and salt egg yolk crabs
5
The best Creamy Butter Crab, Chilli Crab I had so far and Black Pepper Crab! Definately finger licking good. Just writing this comment makes me salivate! Need I say more? hehe..
4
This is a local restaurant and is a little out of the way but has the best crab in all of Singapore, we had 9 crab between 12 of us 3 Chilli, 3 Butter and 3 Pepper, and they were sensational, I was with 11 locals who were also really surprised by the quality and flavour. The guys thought the Chilli was supreme but the ladies favoured the Butter version, they are all fresh and cooked to order so you have to wait a while but it is worth it. all up with drinks it cos was only $600 SGD which was very reasonable. It is very casual laid back and local, go and have fun
4
This is an extremely busy restaurant very much in a Singapore style - the food is great, we had both the butter crab and black pepper crab, both were very tasty but the black pepper crab was defintly the stand out and was amazing. I ate far too much but loved every minute of it
5
I have been there with family for a number of times for the past few months. Every time we tried to order something different. Every time we are very satisfied with the dishes. Highly recommend the carb bee hoon soup. Ask for extra serving of bee hoon
5
The best best crab bee hoon & butter crab in Singapore!! Have to go early to queue! Extremely long queues everyday so be prepared to wait at least 45 mins for a table. Food takes alittle long to arrive so do not go hungry, eat something light before going there. Absolutely worth the long queue & waiting time
5
They have the best crab dishes which I have tasted. I am a soup person; therefore, I love the Crab Beehon Noodle. Try order Crab cooked in salted egg. The butter crab is awesome as well; the dish comes with buns which one uses to dip the sauce...yummy. Also, around the restaurant, one can try out the best durian, if he or she can stand the smell. Really, it smells like methane gas, but once it is in your mouth, it tastes different totally. There are true hawkers across the crab restaurant. We found this place as we have relatives who live in Singapore. Do not go to Lau Pa Sal unless you have an iron stomach. The Chicken satay is a must to avoid. My children had diarrhea after ingesting the Chicken Satay on the sticks. It is a tourist trap. Please be-careful
4
try the butter crab! it is a winner! be prepared to queue if you are dining there. otherwise call in advance for takeaway
4
Excellent food at a very reasonable price - if you don't mind the environment. Book a table or come early as the place is very popular for a reason.
5
We had the chilli crab which was really good. The salted egg pork ribs were unusual but surprisingly delicious. Ordered it both times we were there. Had the usual vegetable dishes etc and they were done well, nicely flavoured.
4
gives serious run for the money to the East Coast seafood places, this is a nice neighbourhood hangout for pepper crab, fresh fish at reasonable prices.
5
My fav seafiid joint. Crabs are huge - i had a 1.8kg crab with claws bigger than my face. Very yummy!!
call to reserve as this place is super popular
2
Ingredients not so fresh during my last try. Standard not consistent, mths ago before this, the same dish tasted so yummy.
3
Was recommended by friends who swear by its pepper crab. But I wasn't impressed. Find nothing outstanding about the food here except that its pricing is more moderate than other similar outlets.
3
Went in the middle of the week with my colleagues and luckily we were early because till about 8.30pm, the queue is still long. Tried their card bee hoon soup as well as the chili crab but nothing special. In fact I find that the crab been hoon soup has a strong fishy smell. At the end we order the yam paste as a dessert and as they promised, it arrived more than 30 mins later as they warned us that they need to heat the re-cook the dish. So do order your dessert early, else you gonna wait for some time before it's to be served
5
We often go there for just the Crab Beehoon Soup. I have brought many friends from overseas and all of them love it. The other dish worth trying is Butter Crab. Getting there is not easy because its quite out of the city centre. Some claims that they put a lot of evaporated milk in the soup ... but its delicious anyway
5
We've been to SG every year in past years and tried many restaurant for crabs. In general, crabs in SG are all freshly, just the method of cooking for food quality. In Mellben, u can order diff cooking for crab, but clay pot is must try or will be regret. Other dishes are good too and ask them for recommendation. Value for money but transportation is an issue. Be sure your taxi driven take you to the front door. Never hesitate to recommend for everyone visiting SG
4
The crab bee hoon soup is awesome and one of the not to be miss item on the menu. Beside that, the stout pork rib is another thumbs up dish :)
4
The food is actually excellent, the atmosphere nice and noisy but what a queu...50-60 minutes wait!
5
Excellent butter crab, vermicelli crab and seafood bencurd are also a must try!
5
LOVE THE CRABS!!! Never Tasted crab better than Melben!
4
The crabs are yummy and worth a try! Be prepared to wait!
4
The food taste amazing, one of the best. The queue in ang mo kio is amazingly long perhaps could try at toa payoh, same food less queue
4
Had the crab beehoon in creamy soup, butter crab and black pepper crab, 2 veg, 1 fried rice and 6 bottles of beer. It was 38 per pax (there were 6 of us). My fav was the black pepper crab, fragrant and stir fried with glass noodles (my fav!) it was very well done. Crab was very flavourful. The crab beehoon (in my opinion) was a bit of a letdown. A bit too creamy for my liking. By the way, I heard prices have shot up since I last went, so don't take my prices for real. Also, reservations are a must. We called to book for a Thurs night and thankfully we did that! There was a really long queue
4
This place is perenially crowded and if you don't get there early, be prepared for a long queue and waiting time of half an hour to an hour and a half especially if you are ordering their specialities - the crab dishes. But its worth the wait - not cheap but good quality food and well cooked.
4
No! While it is good tasting of its Sri lanka crab based milky white soup bee hoon - the service staff needs lessons of grace n realized it is the customers that flock to this place that made it famous. Food great, service with sour pruned face, fiery cashier/boss suckz with a capital 
4
People who come to Singapore are always looking for good local food. One of the food not to be missed I suppose is the Singapore Chili Crab. Take a trip to Mellben and you will find that apart from Chili Crab there are lots of other crab preparation that is yummy and value for money.
4
Awesome Crab bee hoon soup.. heavenly!
The queues are quite long every evening!
4
different variations of crab.. made things special. the queue was long though but all else made the wait worth it.
5
a bit pricey, but you will not be disappointed! the other dishes are quite nice as well.
2
No parking and the queue was 60 people in front of us. So we left.
1
I've always visited this restaurant each time I visited Singapore but this time I was extremely dissapointed and never going back again. I knew the queue is usually long, so I went early as I was bringing 2 elderly people with me. Despite reaching at 6pm, the queue is already long. That is fine with me as it is famous for a reason, the food is really good. However, as I did not want my 2 elderly to be waiting too long, I checked with the boss if it would be quicker if i ordered, "take-away". He told me it would take 1 hour for take-away, and it wouldn;t make a difference to queue, it would be about 1 hour too. So i queued. 1 hour to reach the entrance, I asked the waitress how long till food arrives, she says another 1 and half hour. So i queued pointlessly for 1 hour and left. He could have just told me it would take longer to queue, despite asking him 4 times if he is sure take-away wont be any faster, I felt cheated and guilty for making my grandma wait so long.. never going bac

This place definitely serves one of the freshest and most tasty seafood - especially crabs. But the price is also quite high, especially to eat in an environment which is not air-conditioned and under HDB flats. There's a very long queue as well, even on weekdays which may take up to more than an hour of waiting. We ordered 2 crabs, Oatmeal Prawns and toufu. On another occasion, ordered the bamboo clam as well. Overall as stated earlier the food didn't disappoint but prices are rather steep. But for those who don't like to wait, this isn't the place for you
4
Nice white linnen, good wines. Pretty sophisticated chinese dinning in a busy yet classy environment. You must try the various dimsim (some of which I had not tasted before ), the bebe ( rice porridge ) & the tantan ( custard cakes ) that are so light and fluffy and served in great bit size.Diners on the Sunday that we went there for Dimsim were 95% asian and all very nicely dressed; not a place to go with sandals and shorts but rather in a nice pair of slacks or a pretty dress. Apparently a place to meet local celebrities, but since we are not so up to date wih the movers and he shakers in Singapore, we just really enjoyed our lunch

We heard about Mellben Seafood when we ask some local Singaporeans on where to find nice crabs in Singapore. So, we did google and ask the TA forumer on how to reach the restaurant on my last visit in Nov 2011.We took the MRT (red line) and stop at Ang Mo Kio Station. Took a cab to the restaurant from the station and it cost us SGD6.20 for 4 pax. Be prepare to show the address of the restaurant as the cab driver wouldn't know the restaurant.We reached the restaurant at 5.30pm and the queue was already so long....this is mainly due to their inefficient seating system. They do have many tables unoccupied but you will have to be in the exact number of guest e.g. 9-10 pax for the big tables, 7-8 pax for the table for 8 pax and etc. They were many of us in group of 2,4 or 6 and were not given any tables (although they have some big table not occupied) until the guest at the smaller tables leave. Overall, we Q for 1 hour for a table and another 1 hour for the food!Price is not cheap either. Crab cost SGD45/kg. Each crab is about 1 kg+-. We ordered the crab in meehoon soup (very tasty), chilly crab (too spicy for me), mongolian pork rib (nice), 1 vegetable + 1 fried taufu (nothing special) + 4 drinks (tea etc). Total bill is SGD150 for 4 pax. The restaurant is quite nice but located at ground floor of the HDB flats area.Overall, although I like the crab in meehoon soup, I don't think I will return for a 2nd time due to the super long wait for a table & food
4
A very busy local restaurant in an HDB block.Come early or book if you can as it starts to fill up fast by 7pm. By the time we left the queue was extremely long.We came for Chilli Crab but our taxi driver thankfully recommended the butter crab. We tried both and although the Chilli crab is one of the best I've had, we all loved the butter crab-creamy goodness with a light and tasty sauce. I'll be bringing all my overseas vistors back there, it was well worth venturing away from the more commercial restaurant areas to try this place.Prices were good, around $100 for 4 people including beer, for 2 crab dishes, clam entree, vege and rice dish
4
My title sums it all up. The crab beehoon at Mellben is awesome, the tastiest, sweetest, richest broth you can imagine combined with the juiciest, fleshiest crabs is so good, it is almost worth queuing up for a good hour or so.It would be a much better idea to go during weekdays when reservations are allowed though (mon to thurs only if I remember correctly), to avoid those crazy queues.Every thing on the menu is pretty good but the one dish that really stands out is the crab beehoon, which is a must to order
4
The crab noodle soup is absolutely delicious. The soup has immense flavour, crab meat is very fresh - a must try!
5
Just ask Mr Boon Chuan to surprise u, and whatever they bring, we all love it, the different crabs, clams, as well as Playboy chicken, and Mongolian ribs. We will be back!!!
3
Very nice local setting. Good food, good value. The chili crab, while good, was a bit of a letdown - I guess my expectations were set too high by all the rave reviews I got before going there.
4
used to be better, but its still good :)
4
Love the crab noodle soup
4
I don't take seafood but my frens love this place! So Iguess it is worth the long queue to eat fresh crabbies...
2
Only if you have the patience to wait.
3
This place is a coffee shop and therefore, don't expect much service and ambience. The crab bee hoon is tasty but very expensive for that kind of environment. Though one can argue that the crabs are frsh, but for crabs, they have to be alive before killing them and cooking them as it will taste aweful if the crab has been dead for some time. By the way, don't think any seafood eateries in singapore used dead crabs.This place is very crowded and thus, expect to wait for seats. Very noisy environment too (coffee shop style)I would suggest maybe to try it once during those odd hours to avoid the crowd
2
I'm very disappointed with the seating arrangement of this restaurant! I am here waited for 2 hours in the queue because there'n no table for 7 person. Table available for group with 9 person above. All those that just came not long ago get a table! What is this stupid arrangement! I can't believe that Singapore focus so much on service and yet this restaurant survive with this kind of attitude
5
Everyone in my family is a crab junkie and this is our all time favorite place to go for crabs. The crabs here are big in size yet juicy, firm to the bite and succulent.Their signature butter crabs is the recommended dishes that you have to try. If you have no clue what butter crabs are, picture this – whole Sri Lankan crustaceans deep fried with butter and more butter. The butter taste was not overwhelming but it was sweet, thick, rich and creamy. In short: super nice! It is best eaten with deep friend mini buns to soak up and savour the buttery sauce. The crab bee hoon (vermicelli) is a white creamy soup-based dish but despite all the rave, it didn’t hit the spot for me.Cospicuous long queue of hungry customers tend to formoutside it’s premises during dinner time (as early as 6pm). Here’s the tip: avoid the waiting time by calling up to make a booking in advance. Alternatively I highly recommend going in early to avoid the crowd and really… the line outside is worth the hype and wait!The butter crab here is mouth-watering, finger-licking, must-check-out-immediately GOOD!(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

Crab Bee Hoon Soup and Butter Crab simply delicious
5
Tried it and it's yummy. Love the claypot crab a lot more than the others. the 1 star off is becos the other dishes are quite average. Oh yes, the queue is at least 1 hr on weekend.
3
Long queue during the weekend and waiting time can be up to 45 mins for the crab. Butter crab is ok for the portion but slightly expensive.
1
Overrated and not value for money

Their Famous dish are Bee Hoon Soup with Crab and Butter Crab. It's really nice and tasty, of course some times you will faced with some disappointment with some crab, but this is a place you must try if you like Crab...
