Both cocktail and bar food are nice. The bar is very quiet even on a Friday night. In general, a good hideout place.

Quietly tucked next to the swimming pool. Ideal if you wish to avoid the crowd. Lackluster drinks for the special deal.

Ladies night out. Perfect place thats secluded yet great atmosphere for chill out. Bar tender was friendly and honest in his recommendations for drinks. Would definitely visit again!

The place is a like a furnace around sunset. Not very comfortable seats and food is average. Would not return.

Best new bar in Alexandra area. It is good to visit both day and night with different charming theme!

I enjoy going at sunset to sip a glass of wine by the poolside bar and enjoy a steak with fries. It is swanky bar concept ...modern contemporary furnishing is easy to relax.

If you want to have a beer or 2 here bring a bucket of cash, $15+ for a tiger, wow, I dont even think they charge that at Raffles hotel. The bar itself is relaxing and comfortable but only the prices kept me away.

This is on the 7th floor and is really a type of pool bar or a swim up bar, looks great at night as it is well lit and laid out, prices are quite high and never very busy so lacks atmosphere

We visited the aqua Luna bar and thoroughly enjoyed the cocktails and beer etc and thought we were in a beautiful paradise it was so amazing,but not for the people that , but not for the people that could not afford it but still lovely!

Location: 7F of the Park Hotel Alexandra. By the infinity pool. Drinks: Decent. Good mix of alcohol in the cocktails. Pricey. Food: The flatbreads (which actually are just thin crust pizzas) were surprisingly good!Service: Good but can be improved to be even better. Key Takeaway: If you are a guest at the hotel, by all means come down for a drink to enjoy the environment
