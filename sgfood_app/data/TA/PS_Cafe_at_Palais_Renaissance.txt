It's possible to have a taste of old times Singapore without having High tea at the Raffles : Ps cafe was decorated in style. Good food and pleasant service make the experience complete.

Ordered the Suzy' Spaghetti Crab New Goreng described as comprising wok fried fresh crab and king prawns. There was only one tiny pinch of crab meat. The prawns were not "king" but average size.
The service was well below expectation.
5
Lovely location to relax with a coffee and a piece of delicious (seriously it’s crazy good) carrot cake!

Visit on a Sat morning and see more family having brunch. Wholesome food, not pretentious, consistently good. I found the staff to be friendly, asked the right questions and know when to leave you along. This outlet is a little out of the way.

Wife and I were at Palais Shopping Center to collect a repaired watch when we stumble on this place for lunch. It played nice jazz music, the staff was very attentive, and the food, yummy!

Heard much about P.S. Cafe from local bloggers and 'Grammers, and since I was staying at Yotel nearby, decided to check it out.Verdict, not worth 80$S for a sandwich, Superfood and two juices.The turkey club was cheesy and tasty. The lemon juice was a pure gyp. The Superfood was mostly lettuce to be honest. There were pumpkin bits, goji berries, but not enough to justify the 26$S price

In my opinion, this is once of the more aesthetically pleasing PS Cafeâ€™s. The menu is good, the feel of the restaurant is luscious. However, in my opinion the staff could be more on the ball, a lot of them are rather tardy. The exception to the rule are two little stars...who should, in my opinion should be recognised for their service. Each time we go they never fail to impress, remembering who we are, where we sat last time, but more importantly which wine both my husband and I drink. I would like to send out a huge thank you to, Jae and Nato! You two guys are the reason we will be back!

This one top's the list of my son's favorite restaurants especially if truffle fries is on his mind. And in fact he introduced us to this hidden gem, tucked away in a shopping destination on Orchard Road. Usually our order comprises of the famed truffle fries (huge portion!) along with the green pesto penne (very good) and the husband goes in for the Thai Chicken ('quite good'). We tried the crisps with homemade dips and that was a bit of the letdown. The hummus could have been better, the beet based dip was nothing great and one more dip too was average. We ordered for the sticky date pudding which was okay. The drinks menu is elaborate and the vanilla milkshake is to die for. We generally spend a minimum of 2-3 hours over dinner here as the ambience as well as the staff is conducive for a long relaxed meal. Comfortable seating, good music, friendly staff and good food is al it takes for a lovely evening

This restaurant has been around for a long time , 10-15 years. It's been years since i was last here. This time for dinner, but the garden setting lends itself well during the daytimeJunior staff at the front was clueless. Manager is betterTruffle fries is their signature starter, which we had. Main of cod is average. Sticky date pudding also another signature, which is very good, best dish of the nigh

I arrived at the PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance and was awed by the setting of the restuarant. It's like a cafe in the forest but in a shopping mall. I simply love the fact that they used natural pandan leaves and lily flowers to give a scent to the air in the cafe. It was all good but I was rather disappointed that the staff decided to greet me as what reviews said: with a bad service. I was standing at the door and waited to be serve. 3 staff saw me: 1 ignored cos she was the bar staff, the other told me to wait cos she is new and bringing customers to their seats doesn't seem to be her job scope, and the manager halted me and asked me to wait while he settled some other stuff at the cashier. Oh wells.. so i waited.I was led to this small little corner of the cafe cos I asked for a quiet and cosy corner. The table was dark coloured but I could see that it was not thoroughly wiped clean. The table was shaky too. While deciding our orders, a pair of Caucasian diners came in to sit near us and was rather uncomfortable with their seats. Thus, they requested to change to the inner hall and that's when my mum highlighted to me "hey, did you realise that we locals and other Asian diners are sitting here and the Caucasians are all seated at the inner hall?" And that's when I realised how much I was being judged, just by where I sit.I ordered the truffle fries, crab tart and croque monsieur. The food was nothing to be criticised. Everything was fresh, tasty and perfect. Will definitely go back to the cafe for the food!But I just couldn't help to realise how much their staff doesn't smile to their customers even when you smiled at them (or just cos I'm a local). I was only thankful to the newbie who served us (though she could not lead us to our seats earlier) and the Filipino staff who sent us off. They made the dining experience friendlier and more comfortable. Rule of thumb for those who are easily affected by poor service staff: just do not get too bothered by them. Cos the food at PS cafe is too good to be missed and it's not worth it to sacrifice good food cos of bad service. =

Totally not satisfied with the service.
My dessert was served with no cutleries. I have requested for a spoon and nothing has been given to me for a very long time.
It took ages for my glass of water to be served.
4
Good choice of food, cozy and relaxing with a colonial charm - good selection of food and great service - friendly and competent personal
4
This particular outlet has beautiful & cosy setting. Love the black & white decor theme. Menu slightly less compared to Dempsy outlet but quality usually just as good. Always a delight to come back.
5
This is an impressive and beautiful cafe. My friend and I had a girl's day out and came here for lunch. It was elegant, but relaxing. The food was fresh and very nice and the service was professional and very good. I would most definitely wish to return here next time I visit Singapore
4
We did not have a lot of time as we needed to get to the airport after a quick dinner. The service was excellent, as was the Singapore Sling! I can recommend the seared tuna salad, delicious. Very handy if staying at the Hilton which is directly across the road from the PS CafÃ©
4
The cafe is decorated very nicely and is located in a central part of town (towards one end of Orchard road). I'd recommend the Wagyu beef burger and the truffle fries are delicious. You can replace the regular fries on your main course with the truffle fries for only $5 extra. Also, don't be afraid to sit outside because the al fresco area has fans to cool you down (and the views of the next door Thai embassy and their gardens are quite nice)
4
PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance is my favourite within the chain (there is one just across the street from my house) as it offers fantastic ambience set in the midst of Orchard Road. Staffs are attentive, wide selection of food and beverages. My personal favourite is the "Spicy Prawn Pasta in garlic oil". Top marks
4
Had dinner here tonight and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Staff and the group's concierge were all so caring and attentive and the food was delicious!! We had the crispy calamari with a wonderful cream lime dressing....yummy. The prawn Thai salad as a main dish was also very good with a huge portion of fat crispy chips!! Do try it - you really won't be disappointed!Oh, and the banana and mango crumble with vanilla ice cream was to die for. Only difficulty is trying to find it as it's in a shopping mall on the 2nd floor opposite the Hilton hotel who kindly directed us!
4
First visit to this outlet and it is definitely the nicest of all. Even the al fresco sitting was comfortable as they had fans. In line with its "green" theme were pots of huge plants well placed at various spots of the cafe. At the other outlets, the plants caused the place to feel rather cluttered - sometimes invasive of your dining space especially when you're trying to eat and the leaves are poking your face. Quality of the food was decent, albeit slightly pricey, but you have to remember that you're also paying for the ambience
4
A few of us came here for some desserts and drinks on Christmas Day. It was cozy and they have available on their menu. Christmas Pudding, specially made for the festive season. It contained brandy, which was house made. As usual, we ordered the Truffle Fries, which was one of our favourites. Good ambience and good service.
4
Came here after dinner at the Hilton. Ordered the Pecan Pie + Vanilla ice cream, and the Boozy Black Forest. Very Very good. Definitely will return for a 2nd helping.
5
Lovely cafe on Orchard Rd, I higlhy recommend for either a lunch or dinner. I always enjoy the linguine with prawns and agile olio. Mid range
4
A great place to grab a quiet breakfast. Try the prawn and crab laksa it's very nice and tasty. The PS Cafe is located on the 2nd floor within the Palais Renaissance Mall is located opposite the Hilton Hotel on Orchard Road.
3
Place is great, ambience is nice. What I like is the outdoor, they keep the fan on full blast so it's not hot. I think the truffle fries is overrated and the food was so so.
4
It was my first visit to the Palais Renaissance branch though I have frequented the Dempsey Road and Paragon branches in the past.We had lunch earlier so we opted for a flourless orange cake and a latte to share. Which turned out to be a very wise choice, because the latte came in a receptacle as big as a soup bowl and the cake was too huge for two of us to finish. We got a table without reservations, surprisingly. We were seated in the outdoors section overlooking the Thai embassy premises next door. It had rained earlier so the weather was rather cool. The owners were very thoughtful to have installed giant ceiling fans in the outdoor section, complemented by portable fans on the floor. I was very impressed with the decor and the ambience of the restaurant. The decor is tastefully done, and with the infusion of many plants and greens throughout, the cafe is transformed into a beautiful oasis
4
PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance is a good place to unwind at Orchard road. What i like the most about the cafe is the ambience and quick & good service. They have a very good cafe au lait and their coconut bake tart is good if you like "medium-sweet" desserts
2
The banana chocolate cheesecake was sold out. What a pity. Hence we ordered carrot cake and double chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream. The staff forgot to add candles on the cakes as we were planning for our friends' birthday celebration dessert. Hopefully management will ensure staff are well paid and sufficient manpower, cakes are well stocked on a weekend and then customer experience will be good.
4
We sat ouside in the evening as the inside was full and it was surprisingly not too hot. The crab tart was nice, full of crab flavour. The lamb chops was OK, seemed cold by the time it got to us, so perhaps not so tender. We finished with the chocolate cake for dessert, which was huge - the 2 of us could not finish it. The server was very helpful with his suggestions and service was good. Overall, had a pleasant meal for Western-type food for the area
3
Can you recall how you were embarrassed when you highly recommended your friend to a restaurant, and he/ she only took a few bites and left the rest untouched? Well, that was what happened to me here whereas my beef burger was dry as charcoal. Yet, the chef did not care at all when the server mentioned the poor quality to her. How disgraceful ! I do hope others might be more fortunate than me but I am seriously reconsidering if I will ever recommend this place again
5
My family and I went this Palais outlet for a family outing. Great food and service. Wanna compliment the staff Alicia for helping me making the reservation and also to the service staff Dan and Marvin. Keep up the good work and see you guys soon

Mrs Grunt and I were in Singapore for a week or so at the end of March and the beginning of April this year. Staying at the Pan Pacific Orchard, we ventured out in the cool of the evening and almost fell over this PS Cafe. We were made welcome, almost like old friends (well, WE'RE old anyway!).The food was exquisite and imaginative and we visited again on our last night before flying home to where the temperature was rather less than 30 degrees! It's not cheap, but is very well worth the money we spent. I can recommend their version of the Singapore Sling and could still find our hotel afterwards!We are thinking of visiting Singapore again next Easter and will certainly make for the PS Cafe, assuming that Brexit doesn't keep playing silly b's with the exchange rate. The staff presented us with a couple of china mugs - super to drink from. The handle fell off one of them last week, but I'm still giving them five stars
3
Went there a few days ago to celebrate my friend's birthday. We were given a table at the corner with very little light so its not suitable for bday celebrations with friends but it is an ideal place for couple looking for romantic settings. The food is good and the service is above average
5
Their Aglio, Olio and Tiger Prawn dish is to die for. My most recommended option, though not recommended on a first date unless you carry a bag of peppermint sweets! Ambience is cozy, feels like the interior of a Black and White house. Fast and efficient service, brilliant food
5
Not to mention their delicious warm ginger pudding with earl grey creme anglais & the key lime pie which we will not miss - even if we are full on their always perfectly cooked eggs florentine and THE best truffle fries ... Also enjoy their rose sangria, not just pretty but light & refreshing too. Coffee good. Service excellent.Modern elegant yet warm casual feel. Love the black & white, "machuca" tiles, beams & glass ...They don't take reservations for brunch so unless you come at 11 (or before) or after 1, expect to wait. This is on my always eat at when in Singapore list
3
Dined between busy times in order to get a seat. Waiter confirmed the tenders were breast meat...& they weren't so had to wait for a new order...no apologies. Was never checked on after food was corrected for more water or another drink. Sandwich was great but wanted some salt for my steak fries...again no service after food drop. Sandwich was good but you need to be aggressive here to get taken care of...not my style for such expensive food
4
I have been coming here several times during the past few years. Nice place, with nice atmosphere; aircon and non-aircon seating. Good service and discreet but pleasant staff. The food is good... but I have the feeling that it used to be better. It is my impression that they lost a bit of the finesse that was typical for their dishes a few years ago, and that they compensate that by... volume. Large servings indeed. Good news is that they added an Asian fusion menu. The wine list is good, albeit rather expensive (but this is Singapore).So all in all, still a good place to go for dinner in a nice, quiet atmosphere. And indeed... the truffle fries are a classic !!
4
I had drinks and dessert . It has a much better ambience than their branches at Dempsey and Paragon . The air-conditioners were cool and comfortable . I chose the indoor seating . From my couch seat, I was able to see the outdoor view . A nice place to hang out with friends on a quiet afternoon .

Was here for dinner 3 times in the past week as my first two visits were fantastic. After the third, however, I felt like I had to reduce the rating a little. Firstly I really must say that my first two visits were amazing except for a reservation mix-up, but we were accommodated nonetheless. I'm a vegetarian, and had the green goddess pasta both times as I loved it the first time round. There're so much veggies inside, and the Parmesan shavings add a burst of flavor that vegetarian food usually lacks. I also had the sticky date pudding both times - which I absolutely love and have every time I visit. The flavor of the dates is very prominent, and goes really well with the ice cream and toffee. I was also pretty impressed with their drinks menu, and really enjoyed my drinks (white sangria and vodka Cheng Teng). Coupled with great service, my first two visits were thoroughly enjoyable. Things were slightly off on my third visit, however. I decided to try a different vegetarian main on the menu (the only other one, in fact, other than a salad), and at $26/27 it was a hugely disappointing mushroom wellington. Many things went wrong - the bed of roasted vegetables were cold when served, there was grit on a piece of mushroom, the carrots were undercooked, the sauced was tasteless and without umami, and worst of all the mushroom wellington tastes overwhelmingly of dried parsley and lacked any noticeable mushroom flavors. I may actually go so far as to say that it should be taken off the menu...as it really does not comply with the standards of their other items. At this point I also have to wonder if it was a main that was added to the menu as an afterthought, to cater to the vegetarians. The service was below their usual standards during the third visit too. During the first two visits all the mains were served at the same time so no one was left awkwardly waiting while their food got cold, and I really liked that they made the effort to do this. This didn't happen the third time although I do hope it was a one-off incident. Otherwise everything else was lovely. I thoroughly enjoyed the sticky date pudding as usual, and the yuzu daiquiri was equally fantastic. TL;DR: sticky date pudding is the best, fruity cocktails are delicious, service is generally very good, but please whatever you do - do not get the mushroom wellington.
3
It might just have been a one-off, but my recent visit was a bit disappointing. Two things were unfortunate, I thought: most important, the service was a bit off. Normally, service here is very good, so, again, might have just been an off day. But I arrived around 5:30pm for an early dinner with my toddler daughter. Had trouble finding a place to sit. The server wanted to seat us initially at a two-person table, each of us across from the other, as if my one year old daughter could manage without me being right next to her. When we finally got a table that worked for us, where my daughter and I could sit side by side and we could rest our bag in a chair on the other side, the server appeared annoyed, such that I asked her if she was o.k. She said she was fine and was normally that way, which struck me as odd, since she had a definitely unfriendly look and tone with me. So I asked for a different server, who happened to be a trainee, and was very pleasant and efficient. I noticed there were several other trainees on duty, too.The short ribs were o.k., if not so beautifully presented. Kind of surprising to me, because one of the things I had come to enjoy about PS.Cafe was the presentation of the food items, in addition to the delicious flavor and casually upscale setting.As tends to happen, the portion size was so ample that I had no room for the desserts, which as always looked amazing
3
Have my first dinner at this famous chain. It is quite packed, considering it is about 6ish in the early evening when we arrive. The service staff are courteous and fairly prompt in their attention. I am slightly let down by the choice in the menu. Expected a lot more. I must say the food is okay. We have the ribs, steak sandwich, aglio olio and fish & chips. Overall experience? Pretty decent but not outstanding. Price wise fairly reasonable. Would I come again? Hmmm maybe.
2
Ive visited PS Cafe twice, and both visits have left an unpleasant taste in my mouth. Once, I went - they were so busy, we waited for a long time. We were only there for dessert but the waiter said we had to order more as they have some policy of no sharing, and each person must eat one dish. My next visit, I was shown to a nice seat and it was relatively empty as I went around 3pm. However, the food wasn't fantastic, and the service crew were quarrelling at the bar area. I don't know why, but basically no one wanted to show me to my seat for a long time, and I almost left.
5
What I always go back for - Truffle fries. The portion is amazing and the taste of truffle is simply perfect. PS Cafe used to have another dish called the poutine fries but now has been taken off their menu which was also my favourite. I hope they never remove truffle fries from their menu and keep the size & parmesan cheese generous!
2
We decided to have breakfast at this cafe after searching for a suitable cafe after our recent arrival into Singapore.To begin, our coffee order came out incorrectly after requesting 2 piccolo lattes we received 2 full size lattes. The chef came out to correct our understanding by explaining this is how the Singaporean's make lattes which is completely not true.When the meals arrived, the big breakfast plate had to be sent back to the kitchen as the food was stone cold, the poached eggs completely full of water, and the bacon looked like it had been cooked 3 hours earlier and re-heated. The other, an egg white omelette, came out with toast you you bounce off the floor.After the 1st meal was taken back and redone, it still came out with watery eggs and re-heated bacon.They did refund the cost of this meal, but overall it was a complete disappointment and will never be back. Very expensive cafe charging well above what they should for the quality of meals being served
4
The brunch menu is really "complete" (pancakes, eggs benedict, muesli...) and the food awesome - I had eggs "royale", which is egg benedict with salmon, avocado and spinach (see picture).The decor is very beautiful, we were sitting in a veranda with a lot of plants - really "tropical".Service is not efficient and slow, and prices are a bit expensive (50sgd per person for brunch - one main dish, one juice - not even fresh, coffee). We didn't make a reservation and didn't have to wait for too much (we arrived at 12pm on a Sunday)
4
The decor of this cafe is esthetically pleasing with nostalgic floor tiles and high ceiling evoking a tropical plantation guest house. The food or rather the desserts is absolutely yummy,the profiteroles,the coconut baked well cake,and the carrot cake. I have yet to find any better elsewhere in Singapore. Service wise,though we were served by two trainees(from their name badge),there is nothing to fault. The only regret was that we jumped right into dessert,oblivious to some interesting offering like the baby beef Wellington. Oh there's always a next time
5
When I couldn't find many reviews on this restaurant, I was quite sceptical about this place. I was so pleasant surprised because everything was just perfect for my last dinner during Singapore Holiday.From service to food to drinks to ambience: full marks to them.Ordered for veg Quinoa salad: Completely polished it off till the last grain of quinoa. The quantity was enough for for 2 people but since I was hungry, I didn't share it with anyone else.Also ordered for "Truffle oil" French Fries. These were just insane. I was told later that Truffle Oil French Fries is a Singapore thins and many restaurants serve the same. Well, this was just awesome because the portion and taste of French Fries was very good. I usually stay away from Fries but these I couldn't resist. In drinks, we ordered for White wine Sangria: this came with lychee, elder flower etc. Good concoction and easy on taste.Mind you, this is not your typical VFM or Mid range restaurant so go on a special occasion and you won't be disappointed.
5
After a less than thrilling experience at Wild Honey (see previous review), we made our way to P.S. Cafe for a make-up cocktail. The list is extensive, and the cocktail of the day light and appealing. While we were too full of rich food to eat, previous dining experiences have been top notch. We had attentive service, did not feel rushed or hassled, and enjoyed the vintage music on the outdoor balcony during a tropical rain storm.
3
A very average café. Lunch menu is limited and service is average. It is expensive given the quality provided
5
dropped in for a coffee with my husband to see what all the hype was about--this is a very nice place, beautiful setting, on orchard road but hidden from the traffic since it is inside a mall. Irish & white coffees were excellent. its pricey but I am sure very fun for brunch or drinks with friends, will surely come back. Went to the petit (takeaway) location near toing bahru with work colleagues on another day, pizzas were yummy--Bianca funghi was the best (we were seated since there were seats available, but this is place for take away only apparently)
3
Love the ambiance of this café, drastically let down by really poor service (even by Singapore standards!) . Food when you finally get it is good, coffee fab
5
Cool place to chill out with friends or maybe couple. Good desserts and staff was super attentive. Thumbs up.
5
a very quite restaurant cafe in a mall , very quite with good food. I came for a lunch meeting and we had a very good time with good food and very polite service. i would recommend this restaurant to my friends.
5
Mostly Western food. The food is always delicious. Interesting variety, some healthy choice. Staff alway friendly. I like to sit outside, but at times it can be a bit too hot. Make a reservation as at times the wait can be very lonh
4
All is well in this place next to Orchard Towers, except that we leave with mosquito bites - each time. This of course because we prefer to eat outdoors and apparently there are some mosquitos who like the place as well. I had a good burger and my wife a great salad. After that we -luckily- shared the banana and mango crumble with a scoop of ice cream. The crumble is huge and fantastic, and I don't think you can eat this alone after having had a main course. The prosecco is also nice there. So again a good experience, definitely something to recommend
3
First time visiting this cafe and thought they might have a wide range of desserts but turn out they have limited choices of desserts. Atmosphere is good and the Banana Mango Crumble was not too bad. It would help if they can add more items on the desserts menu
4
I've been here a total of 5 times during my last 3 visits to Singapore over the past 18 months. I love the atmosphere here, it's busy, lively and shoulder to shoulder when full. It has a real buzz and the food is great. The Green Goddess pasta is awesome. Best to book in advance as it is very popular, and you can eat in or outdoors
3
The decor speaks volumes here and it is obvious the owners chose style over substance, favouring black as its primary colour. The cafe seemed to be perpetually full and chairs are lined up on one side of the wall after one enters the cafe, for weary patrons waiting to be seated at their tables.Indoor and outdoor tables are available. Dinner for us was the creamy soup of the day (carrot, cumin and paprika), so tasty and served with a generous piece of toasted bread and two pasta mains (Green Goddess Pesto Penne and Spicy King Prawn Aglio Olio). Both portions are large, but also proportionate to their prices. The penne was served with heaps of greens (broccoli, French beans, asparagus, etc.) but the Aglio Olio could do with a bit more spice. Luckily for me, it was just right but for those expecting a fiery pasta dish, it is disappointing.The meal ended on a sweet note (Flourless Orange Cake and Double Chocolate Blackout Cake). For diners, just a tip; share the cake because they are huge and we truly struggled to finish ours without success. A pity though as both cakes are delicious.A note on this cafe's service, more attention could be paid to the patrons and a little banter would not hurt. The service staff seemed all too eager to complete their work and appeared too task-focused. Try to have a little fun
5
Ambiance is cozy and romantic. Good place for couples for conversations. Staff are friendly and accomodating. The food choices, not much too choose from, but they've got variety, and the servings are HUGE! Cakes, you have so many to choose from and are good. They serve the best truffle fries here! The food are priced reasonably. It's a bit pricey than usual Cafe's, but they have compensated it with good/large portions good enough for 2-3 persons to share!I can't get over with the truffle fries! Would be coming back again and again for this
3
We've been regular lunch/brunch visitors here and the food is always good but the service is deteriorating. There are not enough wait staff and those they have give the impression that waiting tables is slightly beneath them - watching your food going cold in the kitchen as no one seems to feel the need to carry it over is a little annoying, particularly as this is not a cheap place to eat. We were not the only table who had to spend some time waving at staff in order to get any kind of service
5
In my view, this is the best PS Cafe in Singapore. The decor belies its location whcih is in a shopping mall. You feel like you have just stepped into a greenhouse or someone's tropical garden. The array of cakes that line the entrance are enough to make you want to skip straight to desserts. It is a busy place so be sure to book ahead. Recommended for all day dining and if you are after a great looking venue
4
Great location on Orchard Road and really lovely food in a very convivial atmosphere, especially if you eat outside and enjoy the scenery.
The tuna salads was refreshing, service good, great place to discuss business and have good food.
2
Food is good or slightly above average. Pricey but with good ambience. However, ruined by frontline staff who lack the service attitude and aptitude.
Go only if you wanna experience the feeling of owing someone a million bucks.
The other PS Cafes are better.
5
Loved the range of pasta dishes - interesting fusion styles as well as traditional spaghetti bolognaise! Salads are also varied and interesting. Portions are generous.
Only thing I wasn't so keen on was the packed seating which meant you were listening in on adjacent conversation.
4
was recommended by a local to go here. Had a lovely dinner in quiet surrounds. Loved the look and layout and staff very knowledgeable and friendly.
4
Simple, but good food is what you get here. They have also a decent list of drinks. Most remarkably: the very friendly staff.
4
1) Location : Easy to find! Situated right at the heart of Orchard road. Search for TCC - The Connoisseur Concerto which should be on your left and walk all the way straight passing by Royal Thai Embassy until you will see Palais Renaissance Mall and Ps Cafe is inside the building. 2) Environment : Cosy with background jazz music!There is indoor and outdoor sitting. Furnished with old style colonial furniture. Service is good and friendly.3) Food : Serves western eg Italian and Burgers*The truffle fries is a must! Big portion and good amount of white truffle oil! Burgers are huge which you might wanna share with one or two person. Pastas are good enough for one person share. The double chocolate cake with ice cream and melted chocolate is gooooodddd! 4) Price : Ranges from sgd$10-30 per dishOn average about sgd$30-40 per person with drinks and super satisfying tummy! 5) FYI : You have to queue for your seat. And the queue takes up to 30-45min or even 1 hour. That's the downfall
3
Went to PS cafe with friends on a Saturday afternoon and were kept waiting for 15 minutes even though we had a booking. Not a good start, but once seated we tucked into the truffle fries and bread with dips. The 3 small dips came with a mountain of bread, which was slowly devoured by our group. The cocktails were strong and delightfully presented. The one with vodka, lychee and grapefruit juice was a standout. The prices are a little steep, even for Singapore, but it's a gorgeous place to hang out with friends if you don't mind spotty service
4
The food was good especially the fries.. the taste is really nice that you can't stop eating it!!!I had Tiger prawn Aglio Olio, however it was a bit dry and the prawn was a little bitter , not sure if that was normal or just the ingredient makes it taste that way. My friend had the Wellington mushroom and guess it was nice since he finished the food and did not comment anythingOverall beautiful place, nice place to eat. Indoor sitting and outdoor.. reservation would be best...
3
My 14-yr old was raving about the fries. It was quite a large serving for just 3 people and was well worth it. I did not enjoy the lasagna but can order the Angus burger anytime. The shrimp aglio olio was, hands down, the best dish we ordered. Highly recommended. Service was exceptional and the ambience very good for causal dining. My over all experience was 3/
4
I don't at all write reviews online about the places I go but I had such a wonderful time here with my friends that I had to sign up and write about it.So I haven't really heard about this particular outlet because I always go to the one at Dempsey and that one I know is equally good. The ambience here is much better, I believe (at least for my taste). It feels fine dining but still casual/easy-going at the same time.The food, although I have had better somewhere else I feel is good enough to make you come back again. I had the Prawn Aglio Oglio and it was superb. My friends and I also shared a plate of Truffle Fries which was massive! But we couldn't stop eating it because it was so good. And the desserts! The Banana Butterscotch Cake is to die for!Service was very friendly from the moment they greet us at the door. We made a prior reservation to keep us from the hassle of waiting for a table because my friend said it gets quite busy here sometimes and I am glad we did because it was almost full when we came in. I can see that the waiters are trying their best to attend to everybody's needs and for me that is always better than just seeing them chit chat or do nothing as you waive frantically for attention. The waiter that served us, in particular was very bubbly but also knowledgeable at the same time.I can only recommend this place but of course you don't come to a restaurant and expect everyday is gonna be the same but I will definitely come back

the decoration is elegant, we took some meat dishes but the menu is not very elaborated or innovative.The cakesw are very nice.The price is normal for Orchard

PS. Café offers a great and different venue. I had a delicious Portobello mushroom soup and then the pork and apple sandwich. The lemon and mint juice is lovely too - like a fruity non-alcoholic mojito!

I always love going to PS Cafe, either this one or the one in Dempsey. Its not upmarket and great if you have kids. I took my family there for dinner on Friday night, thinking 'OK a dinner out but not too expensive' but unfortunately I was wrong. I dont know what happened--if they put their prices up but for 3 adults and a child we spent $320 which I thought was way too much and the food very average. We all split a calamari starter, 4 main courses (mine was the soba salad, horrible!) bottle of wine and two desserts. Need to scratch this off the 'dont pay through the nose' dinner places for the family now

I came here with my friend just to enjoy the dessert. The restaurant is elegantly designed, yet the atmosphere is still relaxing. Most of the cakes we tried were wonderful.The service is very good. Although we only ordered dessert in a peak dinner hour, we were still served and waited politely. My sister and her friends later joined us and we moved to a bigger table with no hassle at all. They ordered salmon salad and steak, and they liked it very much.Overall, we highly recommend this restaurant

PS Cafe is close to us and serves a variety of menu options that we enjoy, which might lead you to believe that we are frequent patrons of the restaurant. We are not. I was reminded why we usually "just say no" to PS Cafe just this past weekend, when we decided to try it again after a long absence. The service is HORRENDOUS! We waited for 15 to 20 minutes for someone to greet us at our table and hand us menus. I had to stand up and try to flag someone over to us as did another couple who were seated at about the same time as us, since nobody even gave us a passing glance. When a waiter ultimately showed up at our table, he never smiled, never greeted us in any way...he just handed us menus, took our drink orders and walked away. Very rude.The waiter only returned to deliver our meals (someone else brought us our drinks) and that was it. He never checked on us, asked how our food was, if we needed something, etc. I actually needed some ketchup for my French fries (was supposed to have been served with my meal but wasn't) and I had to get up and go to the wait staff's service area to request some, from a completely different waiter. I had to do so the same thing when it was time for our bill, as did another couple sitting next to us. Just ridiculous. PS Cafe is quite pricey. If they want to charge high-end prices they need to create a culture of high-end service. Instead, currently, they act as if they are doing you a favor to stop by your table and present you with an inflated bill. It's an insulting experience and one we won't be repeating any time soon

Excellent food prepared with a delicate hand. Relaxed decor. My first time but not my hosts' who were clearly delighted that the server remembered them and even where they had been seated! Their cakes and desserts are apparently legendary in Singapore but one of ours was ever so slightly undercooked. So 4 stars but might easily have been 5

Had a wonderful breakfast here. Crab cakes eggs benedict yummy. Our friend Chris is the executive chef of 8 PS. restaurants in Singapore. All ckaes and deserts are made on the premises.Try the fries with truffle oil and fresh parmesan cheese a taste sensation! The flowers in these restaurant are amazing

I never write about my experiences in restaurants but I am doing so now because great food and great service normally don't come together in most restaurants in Singapore (unfortunately). But I find this restaurant a gem.I have read some reviews online about this restaurant and heard it from some expat friends of mine too. I went in with no reservations and thought it might be easy to get a table because it's a weekday after all and I am all by myself. When I arrived, I saw there were a lot of empty seats but the receptionist mentioned that everything inside was reserved and that if I do want to be seated in the main dining area, I will have to be given a "timing" unfortunately. I didn't mind sitting out at the terrace bit because I checked and saw that it was lovely and fair enough, I didn't make a reservation.So I went, got seated and was given the menu. There were definitely a lot of good choices but I opted to try their Prawn Pasta as recommended by the waiter who took my order. I find him very professional and was all smiles when he was talking to me. He was very charming and seems to know what he was talking about. He also recommended a nice drink with mint in it which was very refreshing. The food came out longer than I expected but it was definitely worth the wait.Though I saw some really nice cakes as I was walking in, I gave it a pass because they were pretty huge.Overall I was very delighted with my experience and will definitely come back

We love this place. But it's not so much the place or the food, it's about the great service you get her and I must protest against the two posts I just read that indicate the different view. It simply cannot be true, we have eaten here for many years and we have been fortunate to have Derek as our servant. He is very friendly, smile a lot, have complete control over it and as I said the reason we come here almost 4-5 days a week. We have never in the many hours seen just one single customer who is not thrilled by his behaviour and attitude; all is served kindly and with a smile. And he looks at you. So I have to be honest the last two “not so nice” reviews can quite honestly not be right. Even when there are very many people he is present and engaged, a strong and solid service icon for this restaurant, imagine if others were like him.So see this as a tribute to their ever-present and service-minded servant Derek, definitely the best and worth seeing just for that reason. The food is OK, it 's a lovely place, always-fresh flowers and beautiful displays, but it's the service that matters most here. Absolutely fantastic, I hope the management know how much the customers love him. Thanks Derek, All the best Henrik

we arrived at 10 minutes to 12pm. They told me to wait to be seated. Then a phillipino waiter comes to tell me the only available seating they have is outside in the hot sun but seeing as i was pregnant(heavily) he had the cheek to add that he doubted I would want that table in the hot sun. I said "the cafe is empty surely you are not fully booked at this instant" to which he coyly replied "oh not now but we expect to be between 12.15 to 12.30pm so unless you can finish your meal by then we do not have a seat for you". to which I declined politely at his low class condescending arrogant manner. Since my custom/patronage/money isn't good enough for them I shall take my business elsewhere never to return. I am pretty sure they will go bankrupt if they think they can be selective and exclusive in Singapore- wake up! you are only p.s. cafe not fortnum and masons and even they don't have walk -in customer discrimination

Decent food, nice balcony/terrace that is quite unique for the Orchard area. One of my favourite places on Orchard, suitable for everything from a business lunch to family meal.

My wife and daughters enjoyed brunch at PS Cafe in Palai Renaissance. The soup-of-the-day, Pumpkin soup, was rich and creamy. My Caesar salad with prawn was both generous and delicious. My wife introduced us to their house specialty, truffle french fires...yum. My daughter's croque monsieur was fresh, melted inside and crispy outside (how do they do that??). The two desserts we ordered, flour-less orange cake and sweet and sour lemon pie were incredible. Good service and a high-ceiling's urban atmosphere with nice, low music in the background made this a relaxing and enjoyable outing

My latest visit to PS Cafe was disappointing and it ended our 2013 on a bad note. Bad service or should I say, no service and service with discrimination that is really seriously unpleasant!!My friend arrived first at around 5pm in the evening only to be told that dinner reservations are full and we can only stay till 6.45pm. It is bizarre since we had wanted to make reservations beforehand but was told reservations are not allowed for small groups so we had to walk in. Anyway, since another friend had wanted to try the food at PS Cafe, we just stick to our plans and went in. After I reached, both of us wanted to order something first while waiting for the other friend to come. We were given the Tea Menu as according to them it wasnt dinner time yet. We repeatedly asked for the Dinner Menu after looking through the Tea Menu for quite a long time as there was nothing we wanted to order from the Tea Menu. Because we were there for dinner not tea, but they refused to give us the dinner menu. They want us to leave by 6.45pm yet didnt want to give us the dinner menu, so what's that crap? I understand it is not dinner time yet, but the kitchen is there, the chef is there, would it kill to give us the dinner menu before dinner time! And we had to leave by 645pm, if you dont want to give us the menu first, how are we supposed to finish our meal within such a short period of time. Mind you, we are paying customers in a restaurant, why do we need to rush and gobble our meal down just because it isnt your so-called dinner time yet!!!So we had no choice but to order something from the Tea Menu first as we were hungry. Ordered the Truffle Shoestring Fries and the waitress gave us a irritated look and reminded us haughtily of the minimum spending policy that each customer MUST order an item from the menu. We told her we are waiting for a friend and we have yet to decide on what to eat on the limited Tea Menu, so cant we just order one item first while waiting! Maybe we were not as well dressed (we were in casual tee and jeans) as the obviously rich looking guests at the other tables donning their best suits and frocks, so such discrimination from them. The attitude really made us pissed off and uncomfortable.When our friend finally arrived, she asked why we wasnt given the dinner menu. Suddenly a male waiter appeared (he never served us when two of us were sitting there for the past 40 minutes). Maybe our friend presented herself better than us or maybe she look richer than us, so he suddenly sprang to life and gave enthusiastic recommendations AND GAVE US THE DINNER MENU, and lo and behold, we were told we didnt have to leave at 6.45pm anymore when I asked as a matter of factly: "So now then u give us the dinner menu, but how can we finish our meal in only 40 minutes since we have to leave by 6.45pm?" He zoomed off to ask his manager and came back happily telling us "Yeah, u guys can stay for dinner, dont need to leave by 6.45pm anymore!" So what's with the full house for dinner time and tea time no dinner menu issue!!! And throughout the night when we looked around, there were a number of empty tables and not a full house like we were first told.That was not the end. We were asked by another waiter to move tables when we finished our food and was chatting over drinks. He asked if he could move us to another table as there are new customers who have arrived and are waiting for a table. I totally do not understand the logic. The restaurant is not full and there are still empty tables around. Isn't it more logical for the waiter to give the new customers any empty table instead of moving us to another table and giving them our table?? If this was a tactic to make us leave (because I cannot find any reason why they have to move us to accomodate new customers when there are still many empty tables), then the waiter have succeeded. Nobody likes to be moved around when we are already seated and settled down, and all the more for a ridiculous reason! So we asked for the bill and left!Food was very good, I must say, we enjoyed the two main dishes and the two delish cakes. We had the Truffle Shoestring Fries (from the Tea Menu), King Prawn Aglio Olio, the Catch of the Day (salmon with creamy mushroom sphagetti), Double Chocolate Blackout Cake, Dark Choc Banana Cheesecake and two drinks. Three of us spent a total of close to $160.I have no qualms about their standard of food, BUT good food is not everything, with such discriminatory service and attitude, there is no way I will be back again. We did not pay such money to be insulted and look down upon and treated like idiots when we repeatedly asked for the Dinner Menu but was refused with no valid reason. Furthermore, the food there although good, are seriously expensive and overpriced! For that kind of price, I could easily find other places with equally good food and better service

Arriving at the Palais Renaissance building's rear entrance by taxi, I was not immediately reminded though soon realised that I had been to this very same PS Cafe some years ago. And indeed it was to meet with the same childhood friend, one of who's favourite venues I recall it probably is.We lunched at one of the alfresco tables which this PS Cafe has on the 1st floor, a sort of extended wide open terrace which used to be idyllically surrounded by the unique jungle greenery rarely found in as central a venue as this, just immediately off the Orchard Road. It is now much less forested, as the Thai Embassy next door who's garden it was that provided such an environment has cleared it somewhat for its extension, though not making it any less pleasant as there is now space as it were instead of deep greenery.We had light lunch fare starting with a seafood broth followed with cod for main course. We also stayed late into the lunch hour, engrossed in conversation catching up with both old and recent times but were overall well taken care of by the staff who did not rush us.Exiting from the restaurant, the mature decor of cafe cum Asian airiness works well and one feels somehow fulfilled in more ways than one in having had a sanctuarial break from the bustle of Singapore's Orchard Road

PS Palais is one of our favorite and most comfortable restaurants in Singapore. The manager, Derek, is charming and knowledgeable, and his staff is wonderful! We are never disappointed. The carb & avocado salad is divine and the steak sandwich is always a hit! Our server, Paul is especially gracious. His quiet and gentle approach is refreshing
4
Always enjoyed meals at P.S Cafe. You could almost try anything in the menu and it will turn out well. The burgers are really huge and comes with that thick juicy patty. The ratatouille is also one of our favorites, nice and well balanced flavors. The truffle fries are excellent! We tried going to the one at Ann Siang Hill but the staff told us that no kids were allowed in that restaurant.
4
love the casual but classic feeling when i walk in the PS cafe. down to the menu and you can find a wide selection of dishes from categories starters to dessert. i have ordered a pot of ginger tea, surprisingly they put almost a full pot of ginger in there! it was impressive!! i used to be served the ginger tea bag if i ordered the same drinks from other cafe.the food are not bad.the only comments from my experience is the sofa seat near the window side was too packed. i can feel every movement the kids who sit by my back
4
Celebrated my bday here with my family and food was excellent. Ambience was great for families and couples.Ordered the fillet mignon with mash, lamb with couscous, spicy salmon with salad and steak sandwich - all excellent and worth ordering. The cakes on display looks fantastic but we were too full to succumb to dessert.Realised that each outlet has a slightly different menu as I have visited the Harding Rd and Paragon previously.Will definitely visit again, probably for brunch! :
5
Recommened by my friend. The portion of the food is big, so big that you can share with your friends. And it was super delicious to be honest, abit pricy range from $18 to $30.The fries is nice with cheese on top. I tried their brownie pie with pecan, cant really rmb whats the name, not so good though, it feels like the cake was there for a week and the taste of pecan is weird.But the overall experience is good
3
I was given a seat outdoors as I turned up without a reservation. Seating inside looked very nice, with dim lighting and plush couches. The outdoor terrace has a high ceiling and is very airy.The food presentation was rather unique, The Portobello mushroom soup was lumpy, with a consistency more that of a paste, but it was very flavourful and the accompanying slice of sourdough bread complemented the soup/paste well. The 'broken' lasagne had pieces of slightly undercooked vegetables embedded in it, and looked like a misshapen mess. It had an odd mix of texture, as I wasn't used to having a 'crunchy' lasagne.The service staff was scurrying about and it was difficult to get their attention
5
Conveniently located on Orchard Rd next to the Thai embassy. Great for lunch and dinner. We enjoyed their outdoor terrace. Don't miss their chili crab appetizer.
4
I like the cosy bright ambience. A great place to catch up with friends or be on your own, with a good selection of salads, sandwiches, and desserts. There is also an outdoor section.
Prices are not cheap, but this is Singapore, Strongly recommended
4
Met friends over late lunch and I have nothing bad to say about this place. It's been a very nice experience and the staff were graceful and smiling all the time. The food was tasty and good choices on the menu.

Before visiting the restaurant, I checked out the dinner menu first and thought that there was a limited selection of food. I read multiple reviews online and some food bloggers were not recommending this place. However, my friend had made a reservation and I wanted to try PS. Cafe at a different branch.The ambience definitely did not fall below my expectations. Although it was a little dark and dim, it was a good place to chill out with friends or couples. We tried the King Prawn Aglio Olio and PS. Crispy Onion Burger. The pasta was as good as it sounds - pasta was al dente and full of garlic. It was flavorful and the prawns were crunchy. We were given a choice of the doneness of the wagyu of the burger and I chose medium well. It was too tough for my liking and tasted like it was well done instead. The shoestring fries was a little bit too salty as well. The Aglio Olio was a better main. We ordered the Double Chocolate Blackout Cake as our dessert and boy, that was fantastic! Loved the moist chocolate cake drizzled with chocolate sauce and fragrant scoop of vanilla ice cream! It was definitely one of the best chocolate cakes that I have ever eaten.Service was mediocre. I expected better and more prompt service from them. I'm not sure if it was because we were sitting behind this huge vase of leaves that blocked us from the view of the waiters or it was too dark for them to see us signaling to them. We had to walk up to a waiter after 8 minutes of waiting for someone to notice us to take our order. Not only that; every time we needed someone to help us clear our plates, get the dessert menu or call for the bill, we had to wait several minutes to get the attention of the waiters. There were about 4 of them but they were always standing in one spot, gathered together.Will definitely recommend this place just to chill with friends and have desserts. The main courses were average, not too fantastic. Service is a little sloppy but can be improved. Overall, I will still return to this place but maybe just for desserts
4
Visited PS Cafe Palais for dinner recently. Mushroom soup was fantastic and coffee as good as always, but this was the second time i've ordered a salad as a main and was disappointed. When a salad is called a kofte or chicken salad, you do expect to receive a good portion of meat, but what appeared to be a half serving of kofte hidden amongst the salad mix was a bit of a let-down - which is a shame, as i really do enjoy coming to PS Cafe when in Singapore. Perhaps on my next visit I'll stick to standard mains instead.Service is always efficient and friendly. Bigger menu selection at Palais versus the Paragon location, but both a good choice for casual dining
4
Even if the menu selection seems very limited, it make up for it in it's deserts and coffee. Food is excellent however, you just don't have much to choose from. The desserts and coffee are awesome. Portions are for sharing so it makes it a great place to bring the family. Go with the double chocolate cake. Served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, you'll be rolling out in delight
4
On a night where I want consistency, I know the PS Cafe at Palais will deliver. The menu is fresh, the chalk board dailies tempting and the drink lists give a good variety. The service is one of the most friendliest in Singapore, plus the staff know their product and offer very good 'table service'. I love sitting outside on the small balcony, the large flower vases, the mirrors and the lightening at night I feel as if I am transported back to some bygone era. For a quick meal or a full menu or just dropping in for coffee and cake (I love PS Cafes display of their cakes) its ideal. A great place to also be when dining alone with the ample supply of magazines and newspapers on offer
3
The title of this review says it all. The cafe is average in food and atmosphere. I have been to the PS Cafe at Demsey and it has a much better atmosphere. The service was good and the wine pour is generous. Seats are comfortable. Overall, good for lunch but I wouldn't make it a dinner destination. I wouldn't return....not when there are so many other great restaurants to choose from. It's didn't offer me anything that would cause me to return
4
I had dinner here with a friend that I hadn't seen in 20 years! It was peaceful, quiet - I think we were the only ones there that night. It was the perfect spot for us to talk and catch up. Service was great. Food was American style basics, nothing too fancy. Dessert was really good. If you are looking for nice ambience, this is the place to go
4
Went there for dinner with friends. We were seated outside on the terrace - peaceful setting away from busy Orchard Road, overlooking the Thai embassy. Food portions are generous and well prepared. Shared some desserts, quiet generous as well and delicious. Would definitely recommend for a relaxed, casual dinner in a nice setting. One thing that could be improved is reception - confusion over our reservation and we were handed off from one person to another to yet another until they finally seated us
4
enjoyed lunch at the p.s cafe , paragon , good coffee , very nice burgers and my caesar salad was very good
3
Very comfortable lovely surrounds and the food is pleasant but far from the best that Singapore has to offer and over priced for what it is. A nice break from the hubbub of Orchard Rd but that's about it.
3
Food has always been good at PS. This location is particularly relaxing when you sit 'outdoors'Reception on this visit was decidedly focused on chatting with collegues instead of showing us to our seats. The wait staff didnt seem particularly knowlesgeable about the menu/specials. Yes we can read but we have questionsThank goodness the food was satisfactory.
5
The one think I like about this PS Cafe is, the place is nice and it's reliable. Food is good so is the service. One thing even better is when the service or food isn't up to par (it happens) the staff bend over to fix it or make it better. My tip a- get in before 11 am on Subdays!
4
I've walked past PS Cafe numerous times and peered at their cakes, but had never got round to trying them out. I had been missing out - the cakes are terrific. They're also enormous, and probably stuffed full of fat and sugar to the point where you might burst if you ate a whole one. What I'm saying is, don't go there alone - reinforcements may be a necessity.Particularly recommended is the 3G - ginger, green apple and something else beginning with G that escapes me in my sugar-frazzled frame of mind. Goulash? Gnocci? Guava? Gorgonzola? None of those seem tenable choices. Still the 3G comes hot and with delicious sticky icing on top; definitely one to try

My friend celebrated my birthday at PS Cafe. Its was hi-tea period and we do have the chance to have their dinner.They serve brunch, lunch, hi-tea and dinner.Food3 choices for main course during hi tea. Various of cakes and bites. We ordered Green Goddess Pesto Pasta, PS Chicken in the basket and Truffle shoestrings fries.We were very surprised that the portion of the fries is more than we expected. We couldn't finish it. I love the chicky in the basket, crispy and tender not too much batter. For ladies we are on diet Green Goddess Pesto Pasta is the choice; healthy and not-so-much-calories?AmbientThe server asked we prefer indoor or outdoor. I was kinda puzzled, it was an enclosed cafe, why outdoor seats are available. They showed us the 'outdoor seat' it actually another area without air condition with ceiling fans. And that called 'outdoor' (:Anyhow, i liked the environment. Classic and relax.ServiceNothing much to comment. It was a pleasant service i would say.OverallNice food. Worth the price even thou it's slightly overpriced. I will return for dinner.P/S: Tourist: Do come PS cafe to have a cup of tea or a piece of cake during hi tea after much shopping (

If I want a nice respite from crowded Orchard Road, this one in Palais Renaissance is a winner! Everytime I walk into this cafe, on their tiles flooring, high ceilings, beautiful flowers, I will forget that I am actually in a mall. Yes, it reminds me of Agnes B pain grille in IFC, Hong Kong. Different ambience from the PS Cafe in Dempsey Hill. The servings are huge but excellent. The pricing is as expensive as a hotel cafe but I prefer the independence of PS Cafe. The downside is that they will never go all the way out to bend their backs for a tailored request.  I ordered their Crispy soft-shell crab sandwich for lunch and it is out of this world. I also rate their carrot cake the BEST ever...moist and rich. No where else can I find carrot cake to rival PS Cafe's!I will return to PS Cafe again and again
4
PS has been a hit from day one. Designed to fit into the natural settings, the subtle interior and the great verandah seatings..facing the beautiful tropical tree ..no wonder this restaurant has become so popular and it is always full ..Best for 2 or max 4, you need to book , unless you come early and get a good spot and stay for the rest of the evening. This is not a 5star food joint ..you go there for casual meals and chill-out drinks ..in a very natural setting . I like to be there just before the sun sets and enjoy the wonderful colours of a later afternoon turning to evening with a cool drink in my hand getting ready for dinner
4
This location of P.S. Cafe (the others are in Dempsey Hill and in Paragon Mall) is my favorite so far. I understand they've just opened another location, in Chinatown, which I intend to try as well.One complaint I've seen repeatedly about the chain is its high prices. Yes, P.S. Cafe is expensive. No doubt about that. But this location, in the second floor of the Palais Renaissance building, overlooking the Thai Embassy, is wonderfully decorated. I love the fresh flowers, arranged in exquisite bouquets, including in the small but adequate bathrooms. The service is very good, too.I'm not a big fan of their savory items, which I mostly find to be bland, though the portions are large. The truffle fries are wonderful. Have them with mayonnaise. Marvelous. Also, the mushroom soup is perfect in texture and taste, as is the Chicken Ceasar Salad.But, besides the decor, the main reason to come here is for the desserts, which are divine. Special favorites are the coconut bakewell tart (wow!) and the double-chocolate cake (yum!). Also really good is the steamed ginger pudding, which is really like a moist mini bundt cake, with ice cream. Out of this world delicious.They are doing some construction over at the Thai Embassy, which appears as though it will continue for another month or so. We heard the clanging of the work while dining inside. It wasn't terrible, but not ideal, either

After hearing much, I finally had brunch at PS Cafe, Palais Renaissance, yesterday (sat). Small seating area meant an inevitable wait for a table, but I was rewarded with a lovely "outdoor" table. Brunch menu was pretty pricy but portion was huge. Would definitely recommend sharing an order among 2 small appetites. The big breakfast, breakfast burger and salad (with chicken) were tasty but I have tasted better. Truffle fries was very visually attractive but normal to the taste. Good place for catchup with friends..
