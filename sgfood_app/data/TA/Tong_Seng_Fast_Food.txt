Laksa at Tong Seng is very popular among Sinagpreans. I was invited by my Singaporean friend to try the Laksa. Soup is rich in flavour, and noodle is just perfect. Beware if you are not a spicy fans.

This place has a fantastic Chicken Rice! Very tasty. I am coming to Tong Seng every time I came to Singapore. Very good!
