This cafe doesn't provide free tap water, which is ok. However, they do provide bottled water (330ml) at US$3.60 ++. That's the same price for a can of 330ml coke. We tried the roast chicken with fries. The roast chicken was pretty average, if not a tad bit on the dry side. The fries were ok, of lower standard compared to MacDonald's.Toilets in this particular branch are very small, with unfilled liquid soap throughout our 90-min stay in the cafe

For the DC fans for sure! Food-wise, portions were huge, tasty and presented very well. Rather instagram-worthy I have to say. Service-wise, we had the most attentive server .Who made sure we had ample supply of napkins and was on hand to clean the table. Very friendly and extremely polite

All in all, my boyfriend and I enjoyed dining here especially me since I am a Wonder Woman fan. Our experience makes us decide to visit again soon. Also, the staffs (Specially Staff Phylis) are friendly and fast. Will recommend to our family and friends too. ☺
