The food wasn't great although it was affordable. The seats were hard and uncomfortable but the setting was well done. Would try a different dish if I went again.

Offerings include macaroni with cheese, risottos, pastas and pastries. Nice place to chill out on weekends - cosy and relaxed ambience.

I had lunch here with a bunch of colleagues and it was a most satisfactory experience. I had the Barn Burger and mango and guava smoothie. Both excellent. And the service was super fast. And the decor of the place is a very welcome addition.

The place for breakfast if like us you like the full english.we had dinner a couple of times Philly Cheese steak, was a good feed as were other offerings on the menu we did not sample list but it was cooked in front of us and with a smile

This place is good for a quick and light lunch - having eaten here for over 30 times just this year. They have burgers, sandwiches, wraps, soups and even ravioli (pasta).If you are on the go and need a quick and a bit healthier option, The Food Barn is great.Their Veggie Wrap is surprisingly good (and I don't like vegetables much myself), as well as the Beef & Arugula sandwich.They also have quite a number of choices for drinks, including soy milk and bottles juices. And of course, they serve proper coffee :
