Really good service, fast and easy. Staffs are all well-trained. Food is a hit or miss but most of the time is okay...they gave so much guacamole and I love it. Food are reasonably priced.

This was a very impromptu visit, but it's quite a nice discovery as it's one of the nicer Mexican food in Singapore. Had the fish tacos, which I would recommend tif you're unsure of what to order.

Healthy mexican fast food is the first thing that comes to mind. Chicken in burritto was tasty add on the guacamaloe, that was perfect! Not that cheap - at sgd8 each

Ordered a burrito bowl, chips, and guacamole from here via Uber Eats. Order took almost 2 hours, delivery guy went the wrong direction, food showed up ice cold, and guacamole was brown (pic attached).

I often order food in this restaurant in Melbourne, and decided to try something in Singapore, food is really delicious. Especially I like a fajita bowl with grilled chicken.

We are vegetarians and got some decent dishes here. Tried the nachos and hard shell tacos. they were good esp for a food court outlet. the ice tea left a bit to be desired. cost us about 24$ for these 3 items, thats decent by SG standards in a food cour

Love their burrito bowl and burritos! Especially the spicy chicken, steak and barramundi flavor. However I always asked for half cheese but the staff assumed half cheese = half UNMELTED cheese LOL. Not sure if they are lazy or just confused. I said half cheese NOT don't melt the cheese...Serving of burritos is huge, always felt full. Tacos however were small, barely enough for a meal, probably just a snack. Consistency of burritos can be better though, sometimes is lesser sometimes is more, differences is pretty obvious. Their website consist of calories count and macros BUT with inconsistency in portions, how will that be accurate? Service of staff is not up to standard of normal F&B eateries. Not attentive nor friendly. Should be better.

Unfortunately for me, Muchachos, which is by far the best burrito place in Singapore, does not deliver to my apartment, so from time to time, when I am craving a burrito and am too lazy to leave the condo, I order from Guzman and Gomez. The quality is ok, but nothing particularly special, which is perhaps not surprising for an Australian Mexican restaurant chain. Much better idea is to call an Uber and go to Muchachos, in my opinion

The food is pretty good and tasty. No complains about it. The churros are great and you should really try them. My experience on a Sunday afternoon was like this: we ordered food to eat there. The place was crowded and we couldn't get a seat either inside or outside. Then the waitress brings our food to us and we were standing there and told her we couldn't find a seat and she just said "I pack for you to take away" when we didn't even want to take away. Another old lady after us had the same predicament: they passed her her order and she was left standing there helpless with nowhere to sit. The staff just did not bother to do any kind of crowd control at all; it felt like they just wanted to collect our $, dish out the food and leave the customers to their own devices

I don't know why i crave Mexican food when I'm in Asia. I did it in Japan too, and it didn't turn out well (why should I be surprised). But this time, the food was good. Very authentic little Taqueria here. The location is good. It's in the Star Mall at street level and quick. The only odd thing about it is that they don't take credit cards which makes eating there less desirable for business travelers, so remember that

Excellent! My favorite is the Spicy shredded pork.
One warning - over many times here, I have notices that they tend to reduce the quantity in each item if you place a large order (4+). Less meat and fillings.
Delivery is available through Uber eats.

Better than I expected. Had a burrito basket with spicy chicken and a Mexicali beer. Wasn't expecting great things, but plenty of pieces of chicken, reasonably spicy and served up quickly. All this for about 20 SGD. I wouldn't come every day, but a decent fast food option.

Tried this place as I like Mexican and there is a very similar joint called MadMex in Australia. Ordered the Nachos with spicy pulled pork. Must say that it was a disappointment with the pulled pork being bland and not spicy. Had to douse the dish with hot sauce and jalapeÃ±os to get some kick out of it. Can't say I'll be trying this place anytime soon.

Came here to order take outs on a Saturday afternoon before dinner time.The guy serving at the ordering counter did not even offer a basic smile. His facial expression was that of "I don't even know why I'm serving you. I'm not happy at all."I thought perhaps he has had a bad day. But when another guy who later brought the food out to me also basically did not smile or offer any greeting, I realize that perhaps they were all lacking in basic service attitude.Along with the food, I ordered two drinks, and the guy at the counter didn't even offer me any bag to carry the drinks in; he just handed the two drinks to me. I had to ask for a bag before he was willing to give me one.While we have eaten here before and found the food to be acceptable, this current experience really made me not want to eat here any more. I would have expected that a smile, greeting, and being friendly are basic expectation of a restaurant service.Terrible service

My sister and I actually wanted their frozen lemonade but their machine was still making it, a disappointment as the last time I tried it, it was a really refreshing drink. We decided to get ice lemon tea instead.I ordered the spicy chicken quesadilla. As there was melted cheese in the quesadilla, it was quite soggy and hard to hold. One of it actually broke (the skin) while I was trying to eat it :PTo share, we ordered extra chips and guacamole. The portion of guacamole was quite sufficient. They served the food quite fast too!Will definitely come back again! Wish the prices were slightly lowered though

Guzman Y Gomez Mexican Food omg it's a very unique experience! First ate it at my birthday. Love it immediately, Strong Favours Very Healthy Very filling !! I Highly recommend it to those looking for a new unique flavours or Mexican food !!Price: Abit expensive but affordable by totally worth it .

It has been years since I had Mexican cuisine, so I visited this place in hopes of satisfying my taste buds. I'm glad that everything was what I expected. The enchilada I ordered (with spicy chicken) was excellent, though it was too filling for me as it was stuffed with rice and beans. The beef used tasted like corned beef, so if you had corned beef before, try something else.

My family of four had a bill of close to $80 at this fast food outlet which included 4 mains, a beer and a non alcoholic drink. So this is not cheap mexican fast food. Portions are decent except for the vegetarian quesadillas. Tasted better nachos elsewhere

Staff was very friendly and took my order promptly before giving me a number sign to place at the table. Finding a seat can be slightly difficult during lunch time but the Star Vista shopping mall has many outdoor seating areas.I had the pan-seared barramundi burrito bowl ($10.90). The fish was fresh, tasty and perfectly cooked. Soft and flakey, slightly spiced with the garlic and lime sauce which went well with the fish. Added the guacamole to the burrito bowl (additional $2) which was excellent, creamy and fresh!Will definitely visit again in the future. It's great for takeaway too

Finally we have one taqueria joint worthy of praise! Congrats on the new Tanjong Pagar opening! on the weekend though i like to have it from Star Vista branch. For the first timer, it could be confusing but simply look at the Step 123 fro the menu. so far tried your Burrito bowl, enchiladas with meats pork and barramundi churos is nice tooand jarritos.. the taste is like.. cola, root beer and medicine lolsauces are nice too.. habanero is too spicy for me though

I've been here twice. The food is good, and should remind one of american mexican fast food such as Moe's or Chipotle. I don't think you choose your fillings, but I enjoyed the burritos.
3
half-hearted fillings and crappy industrial tortillas. if you want good tacos get yourself down to clarke quay and hit senor taco. only saving grace here: they have jarritos sodas, authentic mexican import - try the guava.
4
This place is a terrific choice for those craving a Mexican bite. The prices are honest, you can tailor-made them to you liking and the location is great, with MRT access and free parking at lunch time.I totally recommend it.

I've been to these in Australia and was curious to see if there was any difference in Singapore so went in for lunch. If you are a fun, the service quality and options are the same as Australia and makes a decent fast food option.

I would rate this as one of the best value for money mexican restaurants in singapore.
I like their Burrito bowls with beef...and i recommend it.
They have a nice outdoor sit out as well...a good weekend lunch place with family

Music was too loud for our order to be heard. I asked for beans and rice in soft tacos and got cheese and salsa fresca. Had to order beans and rice on the side for about $$. As is often the case in Singapore it's better not to order off menu. The vegetarian black beans are excellent and much appreciated. However, putting grilled vegetables inside a burrito is not traditional or particularly good, in my opionon. Just bean/rice/cheese & a splash of salsa fresca please! Still, it's nice to sit outside, casual, fresh and good. There's nothing like a cold beer with a slice of lime and tacos outside on a hot night

My mom and I ordered the Grilled Chicken Burrito bowl, Slow roasted beef with hard tacos. Ice lemon tea and lemonade. Overall, I would say that it was very affordable, the portions were decent and quite filling too. If I were to go there again, I would just order the burrito bowl to share with another person. That would be enough. The burrito bowl was a little sour though, hard to eat after a while as it was too rich. (the taste

Though crowded during lunch time, we were able to find a table after 10-15 minutes wait. The food we ordered, nachos, burritos, tacos and mexican rice, was so good and came out hot and spicy!The sauces that they came with ranged from tangy to mild to spicy. Love the selection of the mexican sauces

We are a family of three and don't eat meat. GYG is healthy, has good variety of food for grown ups and kids and is a fast non fancy lunch or dinner option. Has outdoor seating for those tired of air con and indoor for those liking it. Prices are reasonable too

We went on a Saturday at about 2:30 pm and the place was quite quiet with only two other tables occupied. We ordered the spicy chicken in soft tacos as well as a bowl of chips and tomatillos salsa. The tacos were soggy from the red salsa and the chicken, which was cold tasted rather sad and certainly wasn't spicy! Chips were not fresh, some were quite stale. The frozen margarita was also tasteless. All in all it was a complete disappointment
