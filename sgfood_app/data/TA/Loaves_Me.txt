Loaves Me Cafe which is located near Bras Basah MRT Station and inside SMU Campus is a good place to try some Japanese-Thai Fusion food. Their Thai dishes taste good at affordable price. Must try also their Japanese desserts!

Tried this outlet for the first time today w a muslim colleague while on training at SMU. Was intrigued by the photo of Hazel Shibuya toast (can't recall if it's the exact term) and settled for quick lunch.The toast is rather palatable w vanilla ice cream on super thick toast smeared w nutella hazelnuts. It's Loaves Thai Tea is also thick and nice, and only cost $1 (usu. hot tea at $2.20) when ordered w a main course
