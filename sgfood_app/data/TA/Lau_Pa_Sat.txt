The ventilation was extremely bad and the whole place didn't look to hygienic as a whole, hence i did not have a comfortable dining experience here
5
What a place Lau Pa Sat!! Such diverse food and such vibe, the atmosphere is absolutely gastronomic.
3
Wanted to eat satay so went to this place. Ordered a set which include prawns. We love the prawns kore than satay. The satay taste is not that good, average i think compared to years ago. Price reasonable except for the mutton chop which cost $10! Unexpected. However this place is good for group to gather and eat/drin

It's basically a food court with great food selection, there's Indian, Philippines, Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, and what seems to be everybody's favourite: the satay.Singaporean satay, to me, is influenced by Indian taste. The peanut sauce is spicy with herbs. It's a good variation from the Indonesian satay that I'm accustomed to
4
The food is still good as compared to my visit many years ago but it seems pricey compared to the other hawker centres. I went for the chicken wing and satay which was barbecued quite well and beer of course. My colleagues went for the chicken rice which he mentioned there were better at other places
4
This is one of the must visit hawker Centers in Singapore! There are many variety of delicious Soups, mains & deserts.Satay Stations are located outside Lau Pa Sat.Pork Satay are not available as satay stations are run by the Malaysians Generally service is good and prices are also not expensiv
3
Seriously annoying hawkers trying to push their satay in front of your face. BUTThe store that says "Best Satay 7" and "Best satay 8" is the one you MUST try.As a Malaysian, I would say that the satay is quite average, but if you are a foreigner who havent had satay before. I BEG YOU PLEASE TRY.Oh and , the prawn satay is not something you can find in Malaysia. Not to mention the unique blend of skyscrapers and the lau pa sat building itself. Go there at night, really, and be amaze
4
A fun hawker center with many options to choose from - almost too many! We had Indian, Chicken Rice and blackened stingray (a first for me!). We went early and it was not overly busy - I am sure there is a much larger crowd later in the evening. Definitely an experience
4
I got here at about 11.45pm on a Friday night, straight from the airport with a serious hunger for char kway teow. Unfortunately, only about a third of the stalls were open (which surprised me given its all day, all night rep) so I had to settle for some butter chicken and paratha...which was absolutely delicious, one of the best I have had outside India. A decent price too, given how expensive food can be in Singapore
5
In the back of Lau Pa Sat, they close the street at night (I think around 6 or 7 pm) and serve amazing food such as Satay. It is a wonderful experience to sit in the middle of the street and eat satay while overlooking the city skyline. Must do on your trip to Singapore
3
24hours food available at touristy price. Good place if u get hunger attack in the wee hours. A sight while tourists to singapore may consider to go for slightly over price food since one get many variety here.
5
Best Satay sticks in town! Informal, very nice environment, good Tiger beer to have fun and to relax.
4
When in Singapore you need to make a visit here to try the food especially the satays. Quality of the food was very good.
5
What a great place. After dark it turns into Satay Street and the place gets insanely busy. Smoky satay grills and touts everywhere trying to push the point that their satay is best. We went looking for and found Satay Power 6. And so pleased we did. 10 prawn, 10 chicken and 10 beef satay sticks, a plate of fried rice and a jug of Tiger beer. Doesn't get much better. The culinary highlight of our time in Singapore
4
This place has a ton of offerings, is fairly clean and after 7pm on the week days and all day Saturday, the street on one side is blocked off for satay. You can eat at the tables in the street, however, be forewarned that the station workers are fairly aggressive. I'm not a huge fan of satay, but it is a fun experience. Bring wet wipes for your hands and napkins to hold your table. Also, no outside drinks; not even water. My favorite station is the Thai food, followed by the Indian place next to it. Meals are between S$5 - S$10, which is about $3.50USD-$7USD. The place is also close to Marina Bay Sands if you don't mind a walk. It's a pretty nice walk in the evening.
4
A personal favourite and a great atmosphere- satay sticks of chicken, lamb , beef and prawn, murtabak, vegetables, custard prawns and mee goreng washed down with a jug of Tiger Beer. Great stuff. Cash only. Basic seating and expect people selling you a variety of other stuff. I have yet to be disappointed but I do think they are starting to get expensive
4
It is a good one stop place for tourists and local to try not to bad local food. I won't say that every dish is nice and should try but it would not go too wrong if you just look at the length of the queue during lunch time and that site is definitely a must try for tourist. Price wise I would say is reasonable for tourists given that it is really challenging too look for best of the best food usually located in heartland of who Singaporeans stay.Worth a visit if you are looking for local food
5
Lau Pa Sat has been around for ages. Has undergone several facelifts and restoration. If you want to experience a semblance of British architecture and history, this is a great eating place to come in the evening. The satays in my opinion are the best in Singapore. There are several stalls important to know which stalls to frequent there are stalls # 7, # 8 and # 10 among the standouts. The meat are very tender and the peanut sauce is equally tasty not too seeet. The barbequed shrimps are juicy as well. Took our out-of-town visitors who enjoyed the food as well as and ambience very much. The seafoods are equally nice. Try the fried baby squids, sambal string rays and garlic kailan. Best of all I find the prices are reasonable unlike the prices you would have to pay eating at air conditioned and popular seafood restaurants. The pitcher of beer is cheaper here than as well. Casual outdoor dinining with plenty of options (Indian, Vegetarian, Chinese, Thais, etc). If the heat bothers you, you also have the option to eat indoor under a giant fan. I don't see why would'nt any tourist want to try this old charm of Singaporeâ€™s loveliest food court
3
Sometimes I am a bit surprised about the reviews on tripadvisor but I suppose we all want different things. The place is a bit scruffy and has many different foods offered. at 19:30 the side street is closed and the Satay stalls are set up. I had some from stall 7, 10 sticks for $7. To be honest the flavour was very average and the chicken a bit chewy and fatty. So I was disappointed considering the reviews and being advised to go to this stall. There are a number of girls around the outside seating area hassling you to buy beer. Remember to take a knife (if you want to use one with your food) as they were not on offer inside. No serviettes either so take some or wet wipes. My Wife had Chicken and rice with soup in the inside seating area. Not a lot of meat on the chicken which is why its cheap. Its OK for the experience but I wouldn't recommend you go there for a great meal. Tourist tat (Trap) and I was caught. :-

As an attraction, this place rates fairly well, as a dining opportunity, Lau Pa Sat falls somewhat short of the benchmark set by many of Singapore's hawker markets, like Newton Circus, East Coast, and Maxwell's in Chinatown, just a few blocks away. There are some good outlets here, but the not so many outstanding ones. Even the famous satay market is not so popular as others, with the knowledgeable local community.Popular with the coaches of tourists that drop by daily, that may not be quite so fussy, one can eat well for as little as S$4 per head, or as much as $30 per head, so it's worth looking around and seeing what's available, before being hustled on to a table by one of the many hawkers keen to ply their trade.Either head inside and order from one of the many stalls, or take a seat and choose from a menu, the beer aunties will take care of your drink orders separately, and everything is paid for as it's brought to the table, pitchers of beer, under $20, is as cheap as you'll find on the island, but credit cards are not so popular, so bring your cash. Although much of the place closes late in he evening, some stay open until around 2am at the weekends.Extensively refurbished in 2014, it includes a variety of predictable cuisines, Chinese, Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Vietnamese and Filipino are all catered for, with the odd western outlet for the homesick expat. It also plays host to the Satay Market, in Boon Tat Street, the road down one side, which is blocked to traffic every single evening (from 7pm business days, 3pm weekends and hols), allowing the satay specialists to serve at the street tables, and is one of the few places in the business district that remains popular at the weekends
5
This is my first time here after long time ago. We go here for dinner. And we find 2 place that have halal food and that's very relieve. It has a lot of kind of food with the well priced.
4
We had indian food and it was really good! Although the naan was not that great. Also had beer and spent a really good time in here.
4
Pretty much anything you could possibly want. Not as cheap as other hawkers markets, but still cheap compared with SG prices. The satay is outside- stall 7/8 were the best with sticks at .70c each. Absolutely delicious.
5
It is the quintessential Singaporean place: varied and cheap Asian food, cosmopolitan crowd, in a street food setting. The whole place surrounded by swanky high rises.
Strongly recommended for a short stop when visiting the CBD and the ba.

I came here a number of years ago before the latest refurbishment and thought it full of character. Not so much now. The modern tile roof doesn’t fit the character of the Victorian building. Though the ceilings and fans are still there on the inside, it has the feeling of just another food court. The food was good, as at so many of the food courts in Singapore
2
Since my dad is one of those check the boxes type of traveller, we had to come to one of the famous hawker centres to eat. I was here over 5 years ago and to be honest, I still found this place to be underwhelming and touristy. Also found this place to be dirtier than expected (cockroaches all over the trays at one of the stalls I visited). Everything that we ordered was lacking in flavour, wok hei and effort from the hawkers. Was surprised how highly rated this place was! Maybe it was the time of day or the food that we chose but I couldn't see how it got such high ratings. So my recommendation is to avoid as it is worth the distance to go to a better hawker center for better food.
5
Best Satay ... yes! it was the best satay. The Prawn Skewers are also top!On another night we had Singapore noodles and the hottest but freshest Tom Yum Soup I have ever had. Zingy fresh chillies broth... with clams, shrimps, fish, squid and lemon grass.Low cost beer ...The hawkers can be trusted... do say what you want and dont want
5
As you have many food courts in SIN this is one that is really good. So much choice in food. The Indian food is amazing, well organized. Depending on what you select there can be a long line of waiting but it’s typically worthwhile to wait. Toilets are on the outside and really clean.It’s close to the marina so just go and check it ou
5
If you are a foodie, this is the place to visit. It has pretty much all kinds of food you can imagine. From local favorites to well known international cuisines. The atmosphere and architecture add to the experience. All this right in the middle of a city!The prices are very reasonable - atleast that is what it looks like when you visit from USA. The food quality is good to great depending on which particular restaurant or vendor. Instead of eating one big meal from a single vendor, sampling is the way to go. I don;t know how I missed this on my previous trips. But will definitely be back here when I am in Singapore next time
3
once they close off boon tat street at 7.oopm its a scurry of workers then put up the tables and chairs for visitors.numbers 7 and 8 satay stalls are by far the busiest . The satays are fantastic the chicken a little dry but the beef is fantastic.great atmosphere and a seven eleven across the street for ciders et
5
This place is great! Authentic Asian and especially Singaporean food at good prices and very clean. Must try: Chili crab (this is a little on the expensive side compared to other dishes, but soooo worth it!) and chicken rice!
5
The smell of Asia: Fresh food, fruits, fish, ... You can eat Singapore, Asian, Japanese style and everything tastes very good. Perfect if you are hungry and like to have food for little money in a very good quality with plastic plates.
4
You just go and sit down, someone comes with menus, someone comes and asks if you want drinks. Lots of places do “soft drinks”, we spotted lots of staff in Tiger Beer t shirts, so ordered from them. Your order gets taken, your food arrives. We had “Singapore “ noodles, they call them vermicelli here, still with the chicken,pork,prawns and all the ingredients you know from eating them in UK. We ordered a medium portion.To go with this we ordered a small portion of sweet & sour chicken.........not very adventurous but flying to Australia next day .......Think the bill was around £27 GBP for 4 large beers and the food. Fantastic value when you consider the prices in Singapore. Cash only, no cards.The whole restaurant area looked very clean and tidy, it is located right next to Satay Street. We would certainly visit again
5
Came here based on recommendations and the food did not disappoint. While I was expecting a more chaotic experience of ordering and finding a seat, we did not have any issues. We had two delicious bowls of ramen and a pitcher of Tiger beer. Really enjoyed the architecture and all of the history of the building. A real gem of history and Singapore culture. Definitely go
5
Another great hawker dining experience in Singapore. Plenty of options available all for at a reasonable price. The beer here is even pretty cheap for Singapore standards. Check out the chicken feet if your feeling adventurous. Disclaimer: Visit this place if you're willing to risk trying local delicacies
5
A large range of food, very well priced and located not too far from some tourist attractions such as Marina Bay. This hawker centre is also very clean, looks great and is a wonderful place and atmosphere to sit with your friends and enjoy food. You can certainly buy a lot of food here as your money goes far.I visit Singapore reasonably often - around once or twice a year - and I always come here every time. Highly recommended
3
I was craving some hawker food for breakfast and we were staying close by. It is definitely well priced but not the best I have had. Not all the stalls were open at 11.30am. Give it a go if the location is handy for you but don't go out of your way.
4
This is a hawker center eating area in the heart of the financial district. It is pricier than something you'll find in the residential areas, but serves as good of food as anything else. A lot of people will swam here during lunch time b/c the workers and people working in the tall buildings around will come down here for lunch. Avoid during 11-1 pm is my opinion if you don't want to wait long lines. The food here is excellent and prices are affordable compared to sitting at a sit down restaurant and ordering. You're only paying 3-4 USD$ a plate and if you're in a group of friends, can order a lot of plates to try amongst yourselves. I won't write too much of what to get here, b/c it's all good and other reviewers have spoken out what is good, but as someone who is 1/2 Singaporean, I can say it's all solid stuff! Definitely have someone sit down and hold a seat for you b/c it can get crowded. Some cool history is that this used to be a church and thus you'll hear the large bell still chime the hour as you sit and enjoy your food. The inside is spacious and grand and you can see the tracings of past historical structures- this makes this place enjoyable for food with its historical flavor and location. When you walk out, you are right in the middle of the busiest part of Singapore. And just a few mins within walking distance of the other exciting parts of Singapore like the Marina Bay area and the Chinatown and the Merlion and other places. Highly recommend coming here if you have not hit a hawker center yet and tried out local foods
5
Having great memories of the old Satay Club outdoor satay park, we sought out Lau Pa Sat as the best rated satay street food environment in Singapore. Whilst not as cheap as you might think, the satays are wonderful and even better when washed down with a few beers! All provided on a street that is closed off each evening, Lau P Sat is worth a visit for those partial to quickly served feed of charcoal grilled meat and seafood on a stick
5
Great food and wide range of options, it is not the cheapest hawker markets, but the food is great and I do recommend going there after 6:30 when they block off a section of the road so that the market can spill out onto it and the charcoal skewers stands start their business which is definitely an experience you would want to try
3
Crowded, expensive, not especially delicious. If you like eating in the middle of a chaos, I strongly recommend.
5
We loved this place. Go after 7pm as that’s when the street satay stalls open. You can enjoy awesome atmosphere, table service, good food and beer selection with the friendly locals. Coming from Australia we found the food and drink to be cheaper than home and way more fun than any night markets in Brisbane. Strongly recommend to visitors or Singapore
5
We made a beeline for this place having read reviews online. WOW!I loved every single meal I eat here, particularly the Indian food but really there was every cuisine you could want. I can’t remember how many times we ate here, there were so many visits. Yes, it is crowded so time your visit to avoid peak meal times but the atmosphere is amazing. We did Satay Street on a couple of evenings but I found it rather touristy and not the same as eating inside the hawker centre even though the satay was excellent.
5
Singapore can be quite expensive for food and drinks but the hawker halls are a nice escape from that. There is something for everyone here but i would recommend the black carrot cake and chilli crab. The satays are also great. We ended up coming here twice, well worth a visit. If you want to avoid the crowds i would suggest going there early evening or for a late lunch to avoid the work crowds
4
The prices are a little more expensive and it’s more touristy than other hawker centers. The satay was great, there was even grilled prawn on sticks. We had sting ray, squid and Kang Kong vegetables from the Chinese stir fry and it’s all good. We sat outside on the open air road and It’s good to come late at night. A short walk from the train station.
5
Unlike other hawker centers, this one is a little cuter, a little less claustrophobic (although that’s part of the charm of the experience too), and it boasts food from all over Asia in one place. It’s centrally locates, next to my hotel - SO Sofitel - so I’ve been almost every day to try something new. They have Satay street outside lined with different vendors fanning their grills. I recommend the Hokkien noodles from Seng Kee stall, and make your own soup from Loy Kee Yong Tau Foo.
3
I like that there are tons of options and I like that it is generally clean. They even have Costa Rican and Turkish; cuisines that you dont typically see. There is something here for everyone. We tried out 6 different stalls and some were "eh" and others were good. Your experience is going to depend on what you get. We did think Food Republic had consistently better food across stalls
4
Certainly worth a visit for great cheap food.Generally quite clean for a hawker market. Take your own serviettes as they’ll charge you to buy them or give you toilet paper to use. Beer not ice cold, but dearer than most meals. Still very good value for money. Worth a visit at least once
4
We ordered a small combo satay set for SGD $35, a medium size chili crab for $50, a stir fried Chinese broccoli and 3 plates of Rice’s for $15. The taste is ok and the atmosphere is nice. Not too busy when we arrived at 6:30pm on a Sunday night
3
Located near the financial district, this is a quick, cheap, and clean locale for a fast lunch or very, very casual dinner. Lots of office workers during the week and the dishes are typically $5 to $10. Cuisines are largely Chinese with many variants, Indian, some other Asian such as Malay and Thai, and a representation non Asian including pizza. There are a few healthier choices such as a juice bar and so called healthy carbs but do not expect gluten free or organic options. Popular dishes include noodle soups and curries with rice. Not a great place if you crave a steak or burger. There is a dichotomy between popular and not so popular places but even the busiest serve you within 10 minutes. Worth trying. Evenings have satay skewers
5
Out of all the Hawkers centres in Singapore this one was my favourite. From the old charm to the number of vendors, this is a great place to eat. We enjoyed Indian and Vietnamese food while we were there and both were great.
5
This is the only hawker center that has good food is clean and that is not a hell when it comes to ambience temperature.
All kinds of good food from all over asia at good price.
5
This is my favorite spot in singapore. I go here every 3 months and I order the same food. Consistent and great taste
4
The dish is simple: salmon/chicken + green salad + soba, but it is delicious and price reasonable. Must try.
4
Is a nice place to visit when 1st time travelling to Singapore. Here got a lot of local food with reasonable price.
5
If your looking for something good to eat and cheap in down town Singapore, Lau Pa Sat is hard to pass up. It's clean, cool and well laid out. Probably the cleanest hawker centre we've ever seen. Make sure you have some idea of what you would like to eat before you walk in as there's so much choice it can be overwhelming on your first visit.Try it out. I can almost guarantee you'll want more
4
Go there after 7pm, the evening satay stalls open up. The satays are good, every stall taste the same in my view. The prawn satay is excellent. The beef and chicken are classic must try. The chicken wings are awesome too! Great street market experience! Food is mostly brought to you.
4
Typically local food, with BBQ stingray or other kind of fish. Satay is the most popular in this hawker and you may need to order from outside. Price of the food consider pricey but it is located in the CBD district. Majority of them are self-service except few stalls like satay.Would recommend those who are having a short stay nearby the CBD, and intend to taste the local satay
5
It is very easy to find in downtown and there is option for every taste. The food corners are so many that were wondering which one to try.There is a sitting area as well and the prices are very reasonable. For Singapore which is expensive and for the location it was actually cheap and food was tasty. Me and my partner tried Vietnamese and Japanese
5
WOW! What an experience... I absolutely loved going here, it’s a bustle of various different types of street food all there on little stalls cooked fresh and you just grab a table and go to any stall you like or a number of different stalls, there is so much to choose from. We had amazing steamed prawn and pork dim sum, Kway teow with seafood and various bits and pieces including the famous satay from the outside stalls. The guys selling the satay wander around to drum up business and they’ll bring it straight to you, otherwise you just go to the stall you like the look of, which was all of them... with the possible exception of the stall entitled ‘Pig Organ Soup’. Otherwise you just go to a stall, hand over your money (not much money needed around here, everything was a really good price) and get something very fresh and very tasty. I wasn’t in Singapore for long but I wouldn’t think a visit was complete without experiencing this place, if I lived here I’d probably be here every night and next time I visit, I will definitely be back
5
Loved this place. The food is good and it's great for people watching. It is very clean as well and very central - 5 min from the bay. The best satay.
5
Very nice and clean hawker, lots of delicious food to be found here. Brilliant place and the prices are also not too bad. Also great atmosphere from afternoon to night when most people seem to go here.
5
Been here in Singapore for 10 days and eaten at many places this was the best by far
Get small portions of everything as they come very big in size
Mixed Satay were amazing

A regular visitor to Singapore, dinner at Lau Pa Sat is a fixture on every itinerary.Located in the business district, it’s essentially a hawker centre, popular with locals, ex pats and tourists alike. I believe it’s been there since the late 1800s. I While there are plenty of hawker centres, this one is famous for its bbq satay, for which they close the road each night and set up as a makeshift restaurant. Between the smoky bbq, eclectic crowd, Singapore heat and some over zealous beer waitresses, it’s the ingredients for an experience, not just a meal.As for the food, there is choice. There must be 50 vendors, which sometimes makes it a little hard to pick. However, no matter the choice, I’ve always enjoyed my meal here. For newcomers, it can be a little overwhelming. A lot of the action is outside. You’ll probably want to sit at the street tables. Before you do though, grab whatever you like from inside. Some noodles, rice, laksa... whatever. While the satay stalls don’t restrict what you bring to the outside tables, the only stalls outside are the satay ones. As soon as you walk outside, you’ll be greeted by each stall’s ‘maître de’ (for want of a better description) to show you to a table, give your THEIR menu and take your order. The menus and pricing are pretty much all the same, but for some reason, we generally end up ordering from stalls 7&8 (there might be about 10 in total) Satay chicken, mutton, beef or prawns. All cooked over charcoal and fire, served with a beautiful satay sauce. Last night I had prawns. Peeled in the middle, head and tail on for flavour. Big, fresh and delicious. At only $2 ea, 4 was enough. Side serve of rice $1. Beer $5.50 (almost essential here, it’s soooo hot and washes down the satay perfectly) Tip, bring some tissues or baby wipes. You’ll need them! This is finger licking good stuff. Location : 7/10 easy to get to from anywhere Style : 8/10 casual and clean Price : 9/10 tonight’s meal $9. Plenty of options from about $4 (yes for a meal) Menu: 9/10 : something for everyoneAmbience : 9/10 makes the place. The crowd, the smoke, the heat. A little grungy, but good! Satisfaction : 9/1
5
Whilst visiting with work one evening after we finished around 11pm we popped down to the street food market here. They basically close off a street and bring out tables and chairs and create an outdoor dining experience. There are several hawker stands all selling different varieties of food but I recommend very highly stand 8 and there satay, we had ours with Chicken, Beef and prawns. The prawns tasted so fresh they just melted in the mouth. They also have a stand selling beer by the jug. The main part of this market I believe open 24/7 is an old Victorian iron building and is the oldest in Singapore. This place is a must for any travellers for some proper street food
5
This is a brilliant place - full of choice and bustle, really great prices and wonderful flavours. The Satay is legendary, but so is the Dim Sum and all the other incredible Asian cuisine. It’s a bustling place, great atmosphere and above all the best food around. A must visit in our book and if we live here we would visit at least once a week!
5
I will admit that I went here because the characters in the book Crazy Rich Asians took their U.S. visitors here first. While we were there only for lunch, I can see how this amazing old building would be the wildest at night. Still, you will have a ton of different foods to try here and you cannot go wrong. Inexpensive and tasty, this spot is easy to find and right in the middle of the CBD. Treat yourself to an evening here
4
Tried the satay (beef and chicken) at stall number 6 and they were quite good. We ate where they close off the street and put tables out on the closed off road. A festive type atmosphere and cheerful people cooking. Only downside was hawkers trying to sell you a meal before you have time to look around and make a choice. Would have spent more time there but really wanted to get away from the hawkers
5
I ate here 20 years ago on my first visit to Singapore and decided to revisit on this trip. I took a US colleague who (I guess) wouldn't normally eat in a food court. I bought us a feast of Indian dishes for under $30 which he really enjoyed. The curries, naan and rice were all excellent, although sadly the paratha from the stall next door was terrible - doughy and chewy instead of light and flaky.I loved going back there, it is still such a beautiful structure and great fun to eat there
4
Lau Pa Sat was not far from MRT, only 3 minutes from Exit F of Raffles Place MRT on East West Line. There were so many options to choose. We ordered bak kuh teh, chili crab, satay and beer. All the dishes were very tasty, particularly the satay which was extremely delicious - maybe one the of best in Singapore we have ever tasted! And of course, the price was inexpensive! Really loved it
5
Location is Victorian open air covered market. Delicious Asian and other food under the the sun delivered quickly and for great prices. Especially liked the Satay dishes...No 6 was best.
4
A must visit if you like hawker centers. lots of choices. be carefull of the satay tho. Got served some spoiled shrimp
3
In general Lau Pa Sat tends to be more expensive and smaller portions than the local places.
But there is a Chinese kitchen at one end, on towards the outside of the building, which is great. Really extensive menu, friendly chef and good value
3
They have a lot of food variety to choose from. Indian, chinese, japanese, singapore, indonesian, thai, korean.. So if you are a foodie then Lau Pa Sat is a must go in Singapore.
5
Took a taxi there from our hotel. Easy - it seems everybody knows where it is. There are so many choices of local dishes here. Feels like eating them all. We went there at night when they closed the street and put up tables outside. This is much more fun eating outside. We had delicious satay & variety of seafood.The food is delicious.We'll definitely will come here again for our future Singapore trip.For Muslims - not all stall sells halal food. You need to ask around. Some of the hawkers have menus that says "Halal Food"
5
This place is massive and has tons of options all at cheap prices. I must have walked around at least 4 times before deciding on what to have. The area outside also turns into a food court with vendors selling satay. Well worth a visit for an evening meal
5
There are many venders selling a whole variety of food. It is cooked to order, hot, delicious and very reasonable. We loved wandering around and choosing what we wanted. After a delicious chicken rice dish we shared a mango milk ice. So good we had to go back for another the night after
5
AMAZING is the least I can say. Endless variety, hygienic in general and wholesome, tasty food. Love the Indian stalls. Highly recommend it as there is so much to choose from with multiple Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Malaysian, Korean and Western stalls and the place is affordable. Altogether a steal for sure and offers something for everyone
5
Hadn’t been to Singapore for years & was desperate to eat all my favourite foods, at once. Ordered chicken rice, satay, wonton mee & roti prata. Wolfed the lot down with a nice cold Tiger beer. Service is FAST, food just as delicious and just as I’d remembered it. Only negative for me was the plastic cutlery.
4
Irrespective of the stall patronized, the satay at Lau Pa Sat are grilled perfectly with tasty peanut gravy to accompany. The grilled Tiger prawns are fresh, grilled to perfection, and absolutely succulent. At $2 a piece, it beats the price at many other places and are value for money
5
All the special and traditional Singapore dishes are available every night.
The food is great and safe. Not just tourists. Locals eat here too.
5
My favourite spot for satay, the variety of food is superb, the place is great and public transport is nearby to get to this area.
5
The unforgettable chicken rice. I am hoping to come back to singapore to try it again. It was well seasoned and so good
5
It's very big food court in the old building . You can get all types of food from Singapore . They close the beside Street at the evening . So, you can sit outside and enjoy the BBQ with Beer .
5
Visited many times when I was in Singapore,dinner or supper in the wee hours after night club, alone or with friends. Every time I visited Lau Pa Sat never failed to provide great food & drink. Preferred to seat outside as inside can be a bit crowded but seating in open air bring you BBQ prawn,fish or stingray. Highly recommended and spend your time if you are in Singapore
5
Staying at the SO Sofitel, Lau Pa Sat was right on our doorstep. So convenient for late night snacks and drinks after returning from our travels.Some of the food was a bit average but for the price you cant argue and a great late night atmosphere
5
Went here at my last day in Singapore. At first I want to try Chili Crab but the portion is too big for me. Instead I went to Indian food booth and ordered a portion of Biryani rice with chicken tandoori. Turns out the portion is huge, and it costs only 10.5 SGD. It is also delicious. Recommended if you’re very hungry.You can reach Lau Pa Sat by riding the MRT Downtown Line (the blue one) to Telok Ayer station

We visited this place three times during our visit to Singapore. Every cab driver will know it. If you are lucky enough to stay near it at the Westin its a great way to end a busy day of touring or work. It was the most satisfying meal for even our pickiest eaters. We could get enough and there is so much to choose from. It's located in the most charming historical buildings and houses some of the most unique and spectacular versions of every kind of asian ethnic food you can imagine. The value of money is a sin...so we just ended up tipping everyone we could. It was so good. It's not glamorous and even a bit too hot at times, but it doesn't get much more cultural than this. Super clean for street food too! DO NOT MISS IT!
5
Even on a.rainy Tuesday night in October this place was alive and buzzing. It's a fabulous selection of food stalls so.would fit the palate of everyone in your party. Grab a table, put down your tissue packet and venture off to pick up amazing satay from the outside satay stalls before getting a main course elsewhere and dessert later too if you fancy it. We love it here amd were very impressed with the cleanliness. Price wise it is a bargain and we loved it!

One of the most awesome and climax food experience in my life will definitely be the Lau Pa Sat. Simply mouthwatering food, melt your tastebud, and finger licking good as some goers might say.Lau Pa Sat offers a variety of Asian specialities and a combination of Malay, Indian, Chinese and a mixed fusion of western and Asian touch. Food like spicy Indian Mee Goreng, Rojak and beef Martabak is a must order dish. They are spicy and colorful but taste great. Try the grilled charcoal Satay (beef and chicken) which are being skewed in elongated wooden sticks, grilled on ancient barbecue pits. The aroma of the satay while it was been fanned by the Satayman gave a tantalizing effect and do consume the satay meat by dipping it in a bowl of authentic homemade peanut gravy. The satay is also served with soft tender ketupat (rice glutinous), chopped onions and cucumbers. Fabulous experience I promise you so don’t hesitate to give it a try. For those who aren’t fans of spicy food, the Chinese Hainanese Chicken Rice, Hongkong noodles and Char Kway served with tamarind sauce mixed with peanut gravy can be an amazing food taste as well. For drinks, try the freshly quashed sugarcane or coconut juices. Great combination with your food. After a delightful food bonanza, leave some space for Singapore’s favorite sweet dessert like the Ice Kacang(Mixed beans and herbs served with blended ice, topped with rose syrup and condensed milk). The prices of these food are pretty reasonable. A family of five with all the food mentioned above including drinks and dessert could cost you around S$100-S$150. The best time to dine in would be dinner time where you and your family or friends can choose to be seated outside while enjoying the skyscrapers of Singapore’s CBD scenery. To get there, public transportation is highly recommended like the MRT trains, public buses or taxis. Self parking vehicles are a bit restrictive as parking spaces are all snapped up very quickly by LPS’s customers

Ok lah. Good location, just near Raffles place. Cheap food and very casual environment. We can have many different types of local food.
4
The food provided many choices, suitable for tourists, and for you Muslims don't worry because here is available halal food and comfortable place
2
The food quality is not as great as Amoy st center, portion smaller and slightly higher. Although great location and does look cleaner. Cash only
4
Lovely food, decently priced and centrally located. There are many food centers the food is good in most of the places. It’s open till late night.
4
Satay was great- many stalls there but think they are as good as another - prawn satay is recommended - carrot cake was good - hokkien mie was great as well- many selections for seafood too - can get practically anything, some halal options too!!
4
A great location and a fabulous building which has enjoyed a decent renovation a year or two ago. worth visiting if your on a trip to sample the different flavours. May not be the best at every thing but there is something for everyone in a convenient and historical settin
2
I was there for lunch and the place is extremely hot. Food is overpriced relatively to other hawker centres. The noodles I ordered was soggy and bland. Looks like a typical tourist trap to me. The tables were dirty and the cleaning staff work slowly to clean the place.Not recommended
3
Bought our overseas friends to this place to showcase Singapore food culture. Ordered the satays and other local dishes like chilli stingrays, sambal kangkong, roasted chicken wings and seafood. It was a stuffy night with all the smoke from the grilling. Food was normal except the special satay of beef organs which is only available there. Bring a handheld fan if you plan on visiting there. Only open at night from 7pm onwards
5
You can get excellent local and international food at very reasonable prices from the places here. This is a perfect place to try Singapore's speciality foods... Chilli crab and satay chicken. It is quite incredible how many stalls there are for satay chicken alone. This is situated right next to the financial district of Singapore and is extremely popular with the city workers and tourists alike.The service is adequate for what it is. It is after all meant to be a street food experience rather than fine dining. Many of the places will only accept cash
5
We got a taxi to lau pa sat and we really enjoyed the food. We sat outside and had delicious satay and noodles. Remember to take wipes or tissues with you or you can buy some for a couple of dollars from the sellers walking past you
4
Great location for good food. Plenty of choice. Fast but good quality. Good place to meet friends. Enjoyed the experience.
4
Many stalls at Lau Pasat but if you want to eat noodles do not miss "Budding Chef". Very good noodles well cooked, nice receipe and the price is very reasonable. Definitely a place to go if you are in Lau Pasat.
4
Great hawkers in a great location! Good food at a good price! Out the back they have satay vendors cooking along the street and inside can get a great selection of multicultural dishes
5
On a conference of about 40 people, we managed to book a table at Lau Pa Sat street food stalls, what an absolute pleasure, the food was outstanding, the service was excellent, I cannot wait to go back.
3
Its an ordinary food court just like any other in singapore. you get good street food at a nominal price. There are variety of options available like Chinese, Japanese, Indian cuisines,The building is well maintained looks like a heritage corner between long commercial towers. Visit if you want to try local food and ok with eating food at non fancy places. At dinner you may not find lot of food joints open so be early to enjoy food ther
4
Very basic table and chairs but made up for by some of the best satay in Singapore at very good prices, recommend satay stall numbers 7&8 , find a table and order your food from the guys who come to your table, pay when food and beer is delivered to your table, chicken and beef satay fried rice singapore noodles and a jug of tiger beer
4
Whether you want to stick to the normal old satay sticks outside on the temporary tables they put up every night, or indulge in something more exotic like fish eyeball laksa, you'll find it here. Outside just seemed to be satay stick after satay stick, but inside pretty much most asian and Indian foods are catered for somewhere. Amazing amount of variety for what seemed like such a small place.Only down side was the horrendous pseudo Octoberfest "music" that was blaring at me outside - certainly cut my visit shorter than it would have been otherwise
4
My husband and I and our two teenage children were in Singapore for 5 nights. This is an excellent Hawker food hall offering every Asian cuisine. It is very inexpensive and we were spoilt for choice of so many delicious dishes. Always choose the A or B rated stalls. They have large square hygiene certificates on the wall. Singapore is very strict on hygiene, so you are very safe eating from an A or B rated vendors.As most restaurants in Singapore are expensive, this was an excellent option for our children to get lunch and dinner. The real fun begins after 7pm, when the Street is closed off and all the Satay vendors set up their BBQ stalls and the area is flooded with locals buzzing with atmosphere! You can get a cold Beer but no wine.The best Satay is from. "Best Satay 7 and 8"Slightly smaller portions but tasty and trust worthy.They do not provide napkins so always carry packets of tissues with you.Lau Pa Sat is walking distance to Merlion Park, The Fullerton Hotel and The Fullerton Bay Hotel
5
Simply the best food we ate whilst in Singapore.Street food , of every variety . Cooked fresh , super tasty .Cheap and plentiful.Spicy skate wing , chicken & prawn satay , mixed rice , clams & oriental sauce , oyster omelette........ the list goes on and onTake a seat , soak up the atmosphere and watch the theatrical like show
5
What a night with my office colleagues. They close the road in from of Lau pa sat and lay table on the road.Sit closer to stall 7&8. They're the best satays. Waiters from all the stalls storm in once you sit at a table. Drinks orders taken by one. Satays by another. Rice and noodles by another. Finally the wet wipes seller 
4
Ate here twice during recent visit. Exciting place to eat at very reasonable prices BUT come in the evening and try the satay and beer during happy hour!
4
Larger than Maxwell offers more variety at similarly good prices. Portions are on the small side, but you do get to try a bit of everything.
5
neat and clean hawker center( very organised more like a food court).
plenty of vegetarian options available. lots of satay vendors on the outer edge. I preferred the satay from Satay power than Satay stall 6&7 though they were more reviewed.
5
If u seek local food... street food... head here for the first shot in sgp. Bang in central business district... this is normally swarmed mostly for lunch and a bit during dinner. Covered mall with numerous shops with affordable but pretty tasty fare. I tried the steamed prawn dumpling, followed by prawn wanton noodles and a few beers. A great starting point to Singaporean food

This is a tourist attraction for its iconic century old clock tower and Victorian architecture amazingly preserved over time and multiple renovations. It was an incredible feat to have it dismantled back in the mid 80s and then reassembled. The hawker food there is actually not that bad but if you are looking to eat 'where the locals eat', this is not the place. At one time back in mid 70's and the mid 80's this hawker center was on par with places like Newton Hawker Center, Maxwell, Old Airport etc but sadly not anymore after renovations in the 90's. If you are looking for examples of where the locals eat, take a 10-15 minute walk from Lau Pa Sat to Maxwell Road Food Center or Hong Lim Food Center - the stalls in these hawker centers are much less fancy, the interior climate more humid and muggy, tables and chairs are more archaic, yet they are more frequented and revered by all walks of life in Singapore, and the food there are of much higher quality in terms of taste and even quantity
5
Certainly a "must do" , I visit every time i am in Singapore. Located in an old heritage listed building in the middle of the CBD. An amazing array of cuisines to choose from and goes to another level at night when they close off Boon Tat street and the Satay vendors fire up their charcoal grills. Its an experience to be sitting outside at night with hundreds of other patrons enjoying some freshly cooked satays and a cold beer or two
4
So far have called in twice for dinner and after deciding on what to have have I have not been disappointed itâ€™s just deciding that takes the time and is cheap and yum. It is a must to try the white carrot cake & the chicken wonton soup
4
A bit overwhelmed by choice but after checking out the whole foodcourt, decided on satay and were not disappointed. Ignore all the calls from all the stands and decide what you want on your own, and you will not go wrong. It is a bit annoying that initially you are almost run over with guys trying to sell their stuff, but once you get into the swing of things it becomes part of the (food) adventure. Know what prices are average in other stalls, because our choice stall first wanted to charge us double for what the dish actually cost for locals. When we said what we thought was a better price and almost decided to walk away, the guys reluctantly gave in. It is all part of the pantomime
3
Nice satay and cheap beernis a bonus. Had just arrived in singapore so wanted to test the hawkers center asap. Hot up lau pa sat as a friend suggested it was the place to go. Over the holiday visiting other centres I feel this is very tourist friendly so if you like sticking to the safe side of food go here but if you like to experience like locals try elsewhere. This place is very central area so prices are expensive to some of the other areas you will find hawker centres. The outdoor satay bbq was good at lau pa sat but was pricey I felt for the amount you get

...And by that, I mean it's really important to get it right. You can get yourself an amazing satay experience, or something really dry, and awful. By that I mean you need to be pretty careful of what you do when you come here to visit the satay market.As usual, most places can be easy tourist traps waiting for the stupid white people to come by so they can sit them down and milk their wallets dry. No, I do not apologize for such a politically incorrect statement, because if it weren't true - then I'd not have said so.The prices for the satay aren't cheap, by any means. You're looking around $30 and up if you come here. Forget getting yourself a beer, too, because they seem to rather forget what you ordered, or forget you altogether. Outside drinks also are not allowed here at Lau Pa Sat, unfortunately, because there's a 7 Eleven right opposite that which I could easily procure such a beverage, but it was not permitted.With the stalls, stick around stalls 7 and 8 and you'll get something truly amazing. We dined there the first night and it all tasted phenomenal! The second time over, we ended up at stall 3, and the satay was dry, bland and rather craptacular, if I may say so.When you arrive, there will be people there waiting to greet you and lead you to their tables, to eat at their stalls. Be wary of this, friends, because if you pick the wrong one, you might as well flush your money down the drain. Either way, none of them are cheap, but if you pick the right one, that won't matter. I would rather rate stall 7 as a full 5 stars and the other one only 2 stars. Therefore, my score at 3 stars between them is roughly where I sit here. It's largely inconsistent to say the least.Would I come here again? Probably not, because I won't be coming back to Singapore again most likely, as I've been here six times already. But if I were to find myself in Singapore again for whatever reason, I probably would come back here. But in saying that, it would be for one last hoorah.As with the majority of places in Singapore, I honestly don't know why they rate the food in this city so ridiculously high... I can get a million times better on the streets in Bangkok, and for a lot less on my hip pocket. The only place you'll find cheap food here is the hawker centres or food courts. Most of the stuff (chilli crab etc) is insanely expensive and the majority of it, rather boring and dull. Prices in Singapore will only increase over time as hoards of hungry idiots make their way to the tiny island state. It seems that food is the new black these days, and I am certain that it's only going to worsen the experience for everybody
5
A just amazing building in between all the very impresive skyscrapers.. so damn cheap there.. an oroginal place to have very different style of food. Very uncomplicated and really real life there.
5
Was great to sit and enjoy some of the nice food and atmosphere. The lady at number 7 was soooo nice. Couldn't of helped us any more.
5
This js the best hawker center in whole singapore. Asian multi cusin center with wide variety of choices. Its the best place for have satay. Foods were tasty. Prices are reasonable and had a tantalizing ambience. We 'll definitely revisit this place
5
Spacious and airy eating area with beautiful architecture. Good range of food choices at inexpensive prices. We really enjoyed the variety and quality of food. Would love to go back!
5
all sorts of singaporese food to be found here. Malay, Chinese, Indian... it is ALL GOOD. Good prices, you will not be dissapointed.
5
Loved this place. Stalls 7 & 8 serve up lovely satay and are very friendly. They can also amend their sets so for example, standard set had 15 chicken 15 beef and 10 prawn skewers for $41. We changed to 10 chicken and 20 beef. No problem! Someone came to our table to offer vegetables and noodles. We took them up on vegetables and Singapore noodles which were the best we've all ever had. Shame I don't know which stall she was from. But we sat right in front of stalls 7&8.Beer is good value especially jugs. Atmosphere is buzzing and really must be experienced. Theatre of cooking satay adds to the experience. Wonderful. Yes it's a tad touristy but hey we're tourists after all and loved it!
1
Was there with my friends on 26 Sep 17 cos we wanted satay. We ordered chicken satay from stall 3; taste was acceptable but satay was cold. Then we ordered mutton satay from stall 6. Not only it was cold, it was uncooked! Even the mee goreng, fried prawn mee and bbq stingray were no good. And the prices weren't exactly hawker price. If you want better satay or better local fare, go to East Coast Lagoon Food Village. Near the beach and yummy offering.
5
You want great street food at night --- you want food served on skewers --- you want food with flavor and spice -- Lau Pa Sat will not disappoint. Don't ask me how many skewers we ate. Every vendor adds their own personal flavor to their foods. The place does get crowded, but the food never runs out. Take me back to Lau Pa Sat -- NOW
5
Based at the bottom or river end of China Town, this market is situated in an old building shipped out from Glasgow. This is a real experience, shared tables, reserve your place with tissues or something. Many different types of food available, some things that should never be eaten, food to suit any palate. very busy at lunch time with all the office workers, 12 - 1.30, avoid then but this keeps the food standard high. We kept going back as it was the best hawker place we found. Food is very cheap, as with all of Singapore drinking is more expensive. Our drinks cost twice the food
3
We decided to try this hawker food centre after being told about it by friends, it's probably not something we would normally do. The rating given reflects the food we ate from a particular vendor, another vendor might get a different one, my food was better than my wife's! If you like the hustle and bustle of street food, with a choice of food styles, this might be for you but be prepared to ignore the hawkers. Look for the busy stalls, usually a good sign. An experience, but would not wish to repeat it
5
Went here for dinner at about 7 pm and got seated without a problem. Ordered a pitcher of Tiger Beer and some Sate ' fantastic place to eat - if you are in Singapore you reslly must try it. Nearest MRT is Telok Ayer.
4
Arrived early evening at the hotel and advised to try. Very busy but no problem with seating as in the evening the road is closed. Good and quick service
4
Visited on a Monday night. Was not very busy with plenty of available seating. Great selection of food stalls to choose from, all at very reasonable prices. Was my favourite place in Singapore to eat.
5
You cannot go past Satay street without stopping in at least 3-5 times per trip. The food is delicious and the people are amazing making the atmosphere incredible. A must do while in Singapore.
4
Great setup with plenty of variety and very good prices, would definitely recommend, great food on a budget, give it a go.
1
The Wife loves this sort of thing - stall after stall of offal stewed in unappetising goo, with delicacies whose very name is stomach churning - pigs ogan soup, anyone? - all served up on plastic plates. The satay hawkers are pushy, the Tiger Beer sellers descend on you like carrion crows as soon as you sit, and when you do, finally, find something that looks vaguely like real food, the served up mess bears as much resemblance to the photo above the stall as the Korean bloke with the sideburns does to Elvis.Oh god, please don't ever make me eat at another of these places.
4
We ate there in the evening when they close off the street and set up tables. All the satay stands set out there. And as is said many times on TripAdvisor, stall 7 and 8 has best satay. Also had a carrot cake from a stall inside. This not the dessert we westerners know, it is a savory dish similar to a potato cake. It was very good
4
If you're in Singapore for a week or so, this should be on your list. It's not the cheapest of hawkers, neither is it my favorite - that would be Tiong Bahru Market - but it is quintessentially Singapore, as in that special blend of old and new, of charming and heavily regulated at the same time. Food runs the gamut - try the Vietnamese stall and, of course, some Satay, sit outside and meet someone new any night of the week. It's a little too loud, a little too hectic, pricier than it should be, but who cares. For whether old-time Singaporeans like it or not, this is one scenic hawker.
4
This hawker centre is in the heart of the financial district, there is a huge array of stalls to choose from. We tried a Vietnamaese noodle dish, a mutton biryani and a vegetable dosa all washed down with a tiger beer. Good value for money and clea
3
Lunch at the Lau Pa Sat Pavilions is interesting. There are lots of hawker stalls here with a wide variety of cuisine, from Singapore, Chinese, Thai, Malay, Indian etc. Each dish costs around S$5 to S$6. There are stalls for dessert and ice cream too. Locals and tourists alike all eat here
4
DELICIOUS CHEAP FOOD. Typical local ambience - loud & busy. Super quick, too-eager service. Don't be rushed into seating choice. Watch out for pushy tissue sellers. Hot atmosphere - no fans, so be ready to keep wiping your perspiration away.
4
Loved our evening here.
Fantastic selection of food in a liveley and vibrant setting.
Prawn and chicken skewers are excellent as was the roti.
3
a cousin insist we go to this place as this is famous. i can say just go there once. not worth to visit again. i prefer the the satay .the rest are ordinary and expensive.
4
Got to try the Hawker style food. so many different stalls, each with their own unique foods - including some that as a Westener you probably wouldn't go for. Satay Street is great - sights and smells everywhere.
5
Nice place with lots of different food huts. Good quality and low prices. It stays in the middle of the business district.
5
Each time I find myself in Singapore I go here, the satay madness in the street or the fantastic choice inside. Old meets new, nestled under the skyscrapers of Singapore's CBD this place is not to be missed. LOVE IT
5
Great atmosphere, great variety. The Siopao (Steamed Buns) are something else and the satay chicken delicious. Sometimes it's the simpler things in life that are the most pleasurable. Will certainly be returning on my next trip.
4
A low, Victorian structure in the middle of high rise glass office buildings, this was a fun place to meet up with friends. There is any kind of Asian food you could imagine available at the various hawker stands. I enjoyed the satay and the ice kaching for dessert. Bring your own hand napkins as there are none available, But the food was delicious and the setting great fun
1
Went to try the satay. Sat at the non smoking place. Unfortunately, a waitress was smoking openly and holding on to a menu. I told her it is a non smoking area and she said to me bluntly , every body smokes there, referring to the other waiting staff. I repeatedly said to her to stop smoking and she laughed at me and even told the rest of of waiters of my complain.This totally disgusted me and hopefully the authorities will take action against such rude staff. I will not go there again . I think she belongs to Satay stall 7 & 8.
3
Getting hassled as soon as you walk through the food center is annoying. Everyone is looking for stall 7 & 8, so the other stalls are itching for business. The meal is a set, no rice, just how many people you want to feed. the cheapest set is $26. The beer is double standard price. Food is better in the hall and only $4-$6 a meal and more choice. So yeah the satay, it's a tourist trap, and you can easily make it the same at home on your bar-b
4
This place to ideal to grab a quick, cheap lunch. There is a huge variation so everyone will be able to find something to eat. It is also the cleanest one I visited and the nicest.
5
Lau Pa Sat is becoming a little touristy these days, however Shree Ganga is still the best India veggie food I've had - just love it... the Onion Rava Masala Dosa is amazing! :-)
Definitely a recommend!
4
Lau Pa Sat is an incredible food market between Telok Ayer Station and Downtown, in Cross St.You can try and smell thousands of different flavours around the world. You can choose your meal from a huge number of little restaurants. You can order drinks too, specially Tiger beer.I recommend to you Satay made of chicken, beef or prawns.Enjoy!!!
4
Our taxi driver suggested we try Lau Pa Sat (which apparently translates to 'old market') and I'm glad we did. The food was good, but the atmosphere was amazing. I love how they close the street and set up tables under the stars. It was great to see all the stalls working together, it meant we got to try multiple food stalls and eat as much a possible!! Make sure you try the stall labeled 'Best Satay', it's actually really good!!
5
We visited Lau Pa Sat twice whilst in Singapore. The First time we sat on the tables out on the street. The first time we got first night fever and ordered way too much. We got a small mixed satay set which was great but we could not finish it. We also ordered a murtabak which started my murtabak addiction whilst in Singapore. The markets are a great place to enjoy some recent food, a few beers whilst taking on Singapore. Sitting near the Satay stalls is a bit more hectic but you get the bonus of smelling all the satay cooking around you. It's not the cheapest Hawker centre but one worth visiting.
3
The sate here is only average, and at tourist prices. Beer very expensive. You would be better off going into the adjacent hawker's market, which also serves sate and all sorts of other food. From the look of the hundreds of locals eating inside, it was much better food and much better value
4
$20 Tiger jugs; average quality satay on the closed off street after 7pm; cool ambience; same listing as for Lau Pa Sat Festival Pavillion I guess.It's not really expensive compared to a nice restaurant or eating in Australia or Europe, but for Singapore it really is. If you are a tourist then go for it. Be warned that for an authentic experience, you will mostly be eating with tourists. But you aren't going out to Redhill for the real deal though, are you? Redhill: where everyday is Skol promotion day
4
I hadn't been to Lau Pa Sat since i left Singapore a few years ago. We met up with a few friends and had a few dishes - satay, beef away teow, various indian fried nibbles. I love satay and found the satay from stall 08 (i think) to be pretty good - well charred and the gravy was a good standard and not oily. The other foods were quite good.FYI - My friends and i are winos and traditionally bring wine along to hawker stalls to enjoy with our food. Previously this was OK at Lau Pa Sat but now management don't allow it. Why local Indian friend said this was BS and we seated ourselves in a remote corner away from the main crowds and managed to drink 3 very good bottles between 4 of us 
4
A convenient place to visit and sample a wide selection of local dishes. A stand out for us was the satay from stall 6. Its quite difficult to find quality satay these days but these guys have worked it out. Their ingredients and meat are skewed and marinated at "home" not in some commercial establishment. The chicken and beef satay we had was well sized and tender. The flavours of their satay sauce was old style and original dating back to the days of the Satay Club along Elizabeth Walk all those years ago before the emergence of the new Marina precinct. These guys are second generation Satay vendors. As original satay vendors from the old satay club they have retained the old recipe, rich and full bodied - mouth watering. Try it - stall 6. We certainly have been back and will be back again.
4
Lau Pa Sat is an interesting Hawkers' Market and worth a visit. As you'd expect, the prices are very good and the choices are many (although several stalls were closed on our Saturday evening visit). The satay stalls are quite a sight and provide intense competition. Great value
5
Their oyster omellet is supeeerrrbbb. Will Definitely come back for this. The taste is awsome, make you want more and more!
4
Review by Dr Sim. Good variety of food. Quality of food depends on what you pick. No service. Self service. Good place for eating satay. Satay is only sold in the evenings. Try Fatman. Tourists can visit if they have the time. Regards Dr Sim
4
So much to choose from here runs all the time. In the evening Boon Tat St is closed off and the satay stalls spring into action. All very inexpensive and delicious
5
So many places to eat under one roof. There's 50-60 stalls, Malay, Chinese, Indian, vegetarian and a really good place to get fresh squeezed cane juice lemonade. In the business district downtown. Always crowded.
4
We were brought here by my friend when we asked her to bring us to hawker stalls, as it is famed for being a foodie's paradise. And we were not disappointed. Stall after stall offer sumptuous dishes. I also like the vibe of the place, with that bell that rings every 15 minutes. Definitely will come back and taste those dishes which we haven't tried yet
5
Singapore is great, but it can be priceyIf you fancy a change try a hawker type food hall.One of our party had a selection of dumplingsI had vegetable curry with rice, poppadoms and pickles, $5!!Rest of our party shared a massive plate of satay sticks. Would strongly recommend.
3
This indoor/outdoor Asia food court offers a wide assortment of Asia fare featuring "hawker" food prepared outside and inside with self service being the order of the day. Eating on picnic tables for big groups to couples. Fast/speedy service with collective menus having a wide selection of the traditional Asian food. Prices are reasonable and in keeping with the service and food. Food is good and the facility is open daily for your convenience for lunch and dinner. If you like "hawker' food and like to sit down while eating, you might want to give this food court a try
4
Went here as we walked past it one night after they had shut the street and put the tables out. Grabbed a table and instantly three different vendors arrived with menus. The satay guy (number 7) was great as was the roti guy from the end of the street. Also ordered some noodles and beer. Satays not cheap at 70c per satay or $2 per prawn satay but well worth it (prawns were super spicy with chilli salt). Plenty of other food options too in the main area. I like Newton food market better but Lau Passat is a great experience and well worth a visit
5
Lau Pa Sat means "Old Market". Housed in a preserve market structure in the very heart of the business and banking district of Singapore, this structure houses dozens of hawker stalls which are derivatives of the old road side food stalls serving delicious local Chinese, Malay and Indian food. My favourite time is early hours of the morning for loads of satay-delicious charcoal grilled sticks of chicken or beef meat eaten with a chili peanut sauce, cucumbers, onions and ketupat (rice cakes). The laksa (coconut based curry gravy with rice noodles and seafood) is also fabulous. Highly recommended

Came here to grab some dinner and drinks with a friend and we were not disappointed. The food was good, and the beers were pretty cheap by Singapore standards.We did a little research before we arrived and had already decided on a few of the stalls we wanted to try. We wanted to try the dim sum at Bao Luo Wan Xiang, which was fantastic and cheap ($1 for char skew bao!!). We also wanted to try the katsu curry from Yakitori and Teppan Azmaya but it was unfortunately closed. We decided to go for some satay from just outside on Satay St (a little row of satay stalls, we went for stall 7) and it was pretty good. You can buy a variety of drinks from the central stall, but we stuck with beers.The stall owners aren't particularly pushy, but I'd recommend having an idea of what you want to try before getting there. That being said, having a wander round to see what's available lets you take in all the sights, sounds, and most importantly, the smells

Great experience and close to CBD.
Evening satays are an event.
Inside the Pavilion are a range of hawker style shops.
Great introduction to Singapore style makan.
5
Awesome street food location walking distance from MerLion. You can get any food you want here. It's almost overwhelming. Great experience! Must see! Great food, very reasonable.
5
Probably the best hawker centre in Singapore. We went to hong lim & maxwell before Lau pa sat & this is definitely the best of all three.
5
Has to be one of the most delicious noodle sets I have eaten, not in a soup but a sauce instead. Can't wait to go back !!
5
This place does not open until 7 pm (street does not get closed off before then) but what a great place to go and enjoy the food and atmosphere. We arrived early and had a few drinks in the tapas bar before they opened. Then they offered for us to get out satay and come back and drink with them. Great idea
5
As night draws, Lau Pa Sat truly comes alive with the smells of amazing food being made. There are a number of options from Indian, Chinese, Malay, Singaporean and Western food. My personal favorite was the satay stalls that can be found outside on the closed off street. One of the best I tried and would recommend is Stall 7 & 8. You can't miss it as it located just as you leave and it is always packed with people. They have various option such as chicken, beef, mutton and shrimp. I got 10 chicken, 6 beef and 6 mutton which come with a peanut sauce and chili sauce for S$14. They only offer the food, there are also people and stalls nearby selling drinks, wipes etc. While in Singapore you should definitely visit a hawker centre and experience some of the local favorite. While there are many to choose from, Lau Pa Sat is worth the visit and try something new
5
This little gem is tucked away and surrounded by high rise buildings. This is street food at its finest. There are a myriad of modern hawker stalls selling all types of meals. Wander around at leisure and simply chose what you want to eat. The prices are cheap and there is ample chairs and tables for everyone. We went on a Wednesday night and it wasn't crowded. All under cover unless you chose to sit outside. And if travelling by taxi remember to ask for Lau Pa Sat. Everyone knows where that is
5
Not only that this building looks really nice in the evening, but when you sit outside in the warm air with the smell of deliscious satays you will forget everything else.We picked up naan bread from the inside and a chestnut drink before we ordered the incredible satays with mixed meat.I can not say any more than this was the perfect dinner
5
Heaps of variety, bustling little place especially after 6pm when the street turns in Satay Road. You can get a cheap satay fix here and the price is good. Don't bother with the prawns, still has head and shell on, so I can't be bothered getting shell off once they are cooked and stuck on a stick. Mutton & Beef satay is great. Heaps of variety foods to choose from and cheap prices. Kid friendly as well and Tiger beer is $20 by the jug
5
Make sure you head out here for dinner as it's an amazing experience. As soon as you arrive your senses are hit by the aroma of satays cooking out in the open air...lots of smoke and lots of people but that's all part of the experience. Take a seat outdoors to take in all that there is to offer here. Prepare to feast on the best satays I have ever had in my life! Went here for dinner many, many times. Take a stroll inside and feast on some of the delights on offer here as well. You will surely find something to tantalise your taste buds. What a treat this was!
5
The amount of choice can be daunting but we didnt get hassled. Eating at a Hawker centre is a must in Singapore and this is a great choice. Clean, airy, super cheap with a good choice of meals.
4
Maybe we expected a bit too much due to previous reviews. We thought meat was a tiny bit chewy, maybe a touch over cooked. It just didn't blow us away.
5
We ate at best satay 7-8 which was by far the busiest stall. The food was tasty and quickly cooked..
3
It was located near Raffles MRT, and closed with Ascott Raffles. The building is old but still providing a lot of food variety (chinese, indian, italian, etc).
But the place is too hot (no AC, only electric fan).
3
Good place to try many kind of local food. The quality is just fine and we can say we got what we paid. However it is fun to try.
5
We love this place. It was recommend by local lady.
Food was fantastic and too many choice and we will be back
4
We visited with some ex pat friends who live in Singapore and eat here regularly.Good fun experience- felt chaotic but our friends know the routine well.Chinese food is served from various stalls. Stalls 7/8 outside on the closed road are our friends favourites.We had lots of different satays, veg and a funny quiche/ bread/ pastry thing that was hot and tasty.You buy different dishes from different stalls- or rather, they come to you, as do the Tiger Aunties selling jugs of Tiger beer.Fab night
4
The Lau Pa Sat is one of those hawker markets in Singapore where food is everywhere and no-one stays hungry for long. I go to this market for satay. Just outside the building is a short street with three different vendors of satay - the best one is not "best satay", but the one next to it, called Power Satay. Ran by a family (father prepares the satays, son BBQ them, and daughter is the pitcher), Power Satay is buzling with activity, and prepares great meat-on-stick. The secret is in the sauce (or gravy as it is called in Singapore). Since the market's location and popularity amongst tourists, you have to ask for "spicy" if you want a bit of a spiff. Even the spicy is not particularly hot, which is a bit of a disappointment
4
When i entered this building i was amazed at the architecture - high ceilings and fans. Though there are so many stalls, it didn't feel hot at all. My husband had the chicken rice from fragrant and I did a dumpling noodle soup. The spicy sauce which you can serve yourselves is tasty and flavourful if you are a lover of spice
3
Went to experience as heard great things, the set price meals located in the building a very good value and tasty. Watch out for the satay sales men who must be on commission. Ended up paying $25 for 15 tiny satay sticks, absolute rip off for street food, considering the full size meals inside range between $5-$10
5
Brilliant; $95 for a mountain of satay, beer and bread. Fantastic value and great tasting food. Really swift and friendly service
5
So much variety of traditional Singapore food. If I can say an "upmarket" hawker food center. Nice vibe with everything for anyone's taste!
5
All manner of Asian food can be found here. So many Satay sticks! Its a modern style hawker centre, open air, but under cover. Its always busy with locals and tourists. I honestly can't pick a favourite stall. I could eat here every day.
4
We dined here a couple of times during our stay. Loved the chilli mud crabs! Lots of variety to choose from.
3
The food center is placed in an old lovely colonial building. Different stalls offer local food, the place is often crowded especially for lunch when the employees get down from offices to get their food. I noticed that quality is slowly getting lower and more and more stalls are getting into global food and offering now also Mexican and pinoy food.Satay are the most suggested food. To be frank ... it was better a few years ago,,
5
In the recent years, Vegetarian Cuisine is gaining popularity and becoming a norm in today world. If Bugis in Singapore is a Vegetarian Haven, then I would say, Lau Pa Sat, Singapore’s most resplendent hawker centre in a historical building dating back 1894, is a Vegetarian Friendly Haven!Non-vegetarian stalls even have one or more vegetarian options on their menu. Indeed, vegetarian friendly. Also there are Chinese and Indian Vegetarian Stalls.A great place for tourists to experience and enjoy the local favourites meal at a hawker centre environment at the Central Business District (CBD), which is easily accessible by public transport. Also to feel and experience the rush lunch hour on weekday in the CBD
4
This place is a good 10 min walk from The Fullerton Hotel but we visited here for breakfast and dinner numerous times since it was much cheaper, and tastier than the hotel breakfast fare. Highlights were the condensed milk coffee, Kayu toast and the chicken rice!! The satay from stall #8 was very good and locals concurred suggesting this one was also the best of all the stalls offering satay in the evenings
2
The city must have decided some years ago to consolidate the local street food stalls at this one location. The result is poorly executed. The venue is an attractive pavilion and we had high hopes for choosing among the various food vendors.We chose three different food vendors and all three meals were sorely disappointing and not well prepared with quality ingredients.You can do better elsewhere! The vendors seem to be generalizing their dishes and menus so as to be very similar to their competitors with few exceptions
4
The Hainanese chicken rice is good (not boneless though), but I think it’s more known for satay. Among the food centers I tried, this is the most beautiful because of the sophisticated colonial architecture, like the ornate British columns. It's open til late night, and TIP: They sell a pitcher of Tiger for only S$20, perfect for a cheap pre-game
4
After traveling all day & arriving at our hotel around 9pm it was great to know we could head down to lau pa sat & grab a late dinner rather than having to have room service in the hotel. Very casual so was perfect for us to just head down there after checking in. We didn't eat in the building but ventured out onto the street & had satay out there. Once you get past the guys promoting "worlds best satay" and you take a seat it really is pretty good satay. We didn't have high expectations but found ourselves ordering more after demolishing the first plate quite quickly. It's easy to order a drink, food is quick, people are friendly & it's the perfect space to soak up the atmosphere. If you are after a nice romantic sit down dinner this isn't your place. Perfect place to immerse yourself, people watch & enjoy.
5
Great place for cheap foods, you are bound to find something that satisfies your palette eventually.
4
I have eaten here a few times now always leaving satisfied. Vast range of stalls to choose from - majority cooked in front of you with fresh ingredients. Recommended.
3
This is a great venue and an amazing variety of food available. We had the Satay and it was expensive and not very good.The Chinese food we paired was also expensive and not very good.There are MUCH better places that are way cheaper but this is a nice venue.I won't rush back
5
This was a unique hawker experience - great atmosphere as they close down the streets and have a line of stalls of great barbecue. We had some awesome satays and cereal prawns! Only downside was that there were no baby chairs so it was a bit of a challenge with a toddler.
5
This was on our to do list and we were certainly not disappointed! Not the cheapest of places to eat street food but the satay is to die for! Top tip, don't eat inside. Walk through the covered area to the outside where you will find lots of satay stalls. Pick a table and they will then come to you with menus for both food and drink. Also a very good roti stall there too. Definitely worth a visit (after 7pm), fab view of the skyscrapers and MRT not far
4
I stayed at the sofitel across the street for a week so I came here quite often. The lunch and dinner options I tried were all good but some of the dim sum tasted off by dinner time so I recommend getting the satay if going for dinner. I always went to stall 8 for the satay. The Japanese bakeries were also quite good and worth a stop in the mornings for melon buns
1
Came with some overseas friends to show them this iconic place. I have not been here myself for 20 years. As a local we know this isn't the best place to get local food. This place is known for the Satay. The stalls moved over from the then well known satay club 30 years back. We order some satay set, chicken and mutton at $28 for 20 sticks. At $1.40 per stick, it's pricy. It was served luke warm. My friend went back to the servicing staff and was told to bring the plate back ourselves. They heat it up but reheating had some meat burnt. Yet I must say the satay is one of the tastier ones on the island. There are many different stalls servicing different cuisines from around the region and large selection - Tim Sum, beef noodle, fried prawn mee, chicken rice, Japanese, Thai, Viet, Philippines, carrot cake, barbecue seafood and the list goes on. However, sad to say, the dishes and drinks we had were over priced and really very average. You can get much better elsewhere. We order a jug of beer at $20 from this drink stall near the satay alfresco street. When my Thai friend went back to ask for some ice, the servicing staff was very unfriendly, refused and told her to buy more beer. When I went, she quietly gave me a cup of ice. I feel shy that my overseas friend were treated so badly. I will not bring my friends from overseas there anymore nor go back myself. Not recommended
5
Great place to eat in Singapore. Very clean, organized and with a huge variety of food and budget. Most of the places are very cheap to eat, and at all the stalls that I have eaten the food were GREAT! Outside you can find a liquor store (still expensive to buy alcohol, but less expensive than in other places) and some attractions are nearby
4
Great food court, so much more fun then the one in the shopping malls, although those too are a must see especially if you never been in Singapore.If you go with friends of family, grab a chair and table first and then pick what you want to eat
4
We took the MRT from Changi Airport to Raffles Place so we could visit this food hall on an overnight stop here in Singapore on our way to Australia. An easy 30 minute train ride from terminal 3 (change to westbound train at Tanah Merah sation) for $5. A 5 minute walk from the station to this vibrant foodcourt. Large choice of eateries inside, plus an out side area where the say hawkers are. This area was packed and a great atmosphere. We chose a vietmanese place where for $6 each we had a large bowl of chicken and noodles and smoked duck and noodles, both delicious. Also bough a half pint of beer, which wasn't a half once all the froth had subsided for $5.50, so not good value. But certainly recommend the food hall
5
This food is simply amazing for it's price. Perfect option to get some Asian food right in the heart of the business district!
5
Plenty of Hawker Stalls to choose from, offering a wide range of food. This is the kind of place "locals" go (not very touristy) and the food is excellent. Sampled dishes from several stall and enjoyed them all.
5
It's architecturally a beautiful place. Many stalls with a wide variety of food choices. It was a bit confusing for us first timers. A regular would know where to go and which dish is good from which stall.
Would recommend one visit definitely.
5
Great food with plenty of choice at a low price. We went there with the family and friends and found it extremely good.
4
Well worth a visit to see this food market. Well regulated. Food especially the satay very nice. Check and compare prices before you order. Sellers work hard to have your custom. Great variety of dishes.
4
Lau Pau Sat is very convenient to Chinatown and Marine Bay and what a range a food choices! Fantastic food selection range with quality food. Plenty of seating even on a Saturday night. Clean and hygenic.Be aware of prices, as not always obvious, and can be mislead and pay too much.
5
Lau Pa Sat is one of Singapore's famous hawker markets. The range of food available and the prices are absolutely excellent. Though it is extremely popular with locals as well as tourists around lunch and dinner times. In addition of an evening the best satay's in Singapore can be found at the footpath out the front
4
so there are lots of different stalls undercover and also outside stalls.Take the time to walk around and see what each vendor has to offer.If you are adventurous in tasting local foods then you will be able to eat here.But if you are more of a clean restaurant kind of person then dont come here.Its basically a range of street vendors really that have a cheap food.The outside area has alot of different satay places. They are cheap and they are tasy so dont be afraid to choose a variety. Eat like a local and the food is tasty .Just dont do the indian stall as the only person from our group who ate there ended up with really bad food posioning.The rest of us try malay style food and tried the satay sticks and seafood and we were all fine
5
My family wanted to experience as much local food as we could so we stopped at Lau Pa Sat for lunch on a Saturday. It wasn't very busy so not all of the stalls were open but I heard they are very busy during the week at lunch because they are in the financial district. The food was great there was so much to choose from. It was also very clean. A warning about the bathrooms, they are free to use but you have to pay for toilet paper. We were out of spare change so we ended up skipping it and finding a very clean one at the closest MRT station
4
Great and cheap. Can have eggs, toast and coffee $4SD. Lunch and dinner has great range of foods to eat. Beer available, fruit juices etc but if you want a wine go to the Seven 11 at the back of the centre and buy little bottles.At night the road closes for a Satay extravaganza. Tissue pack needed to reserve your table as you wander around trying to decide what you want to eat
4
Place comes alive after 6:30 at night. Satay stalls, seafood and Indian. Locals eat here and street beside get closed off for tables. Well worth the experience.
5
This place has a wonderful atmosphere combined with lots of food great and beer. Every time we have friends or family visiting, we spend at least one evening here. Try the tasty bbq prawns at stall 7&8!
4
i work near this place and often come there to eat at lunch. The difference is wonderfull. You can eat dishes from every country you want for not big money!
5
This place is really good, tourists can try many food here, I love satay so much, you can also enjoy sea food, local food, and special drinks here, the price of dishes are cheap, the atmosphere here is hot.
5
Incredibly beautiful architecture in this glorious old building which houses a great hawker market. Arrive before 10pm to ensure maximum selection of open stalls. The roast pork and duck were execellent.
4
On 28/6, we went to Lau Pa Sat, looking for the famous satay there. We were offered by a Chinese-man waiter, from the "Best Satay 8" stall. We ordered 5 beef satay + 5 chicken satay + 5 prawns satay, we paid SGD 41. But, when we ordered at the sate stall to take away, at â€œThe Best Satay 8", the correct price is SGD 26 for 10 beef satay + 10 chicken satay + 6 shrimp satay. We have been deceived! You must be careful
4
Easy taxi ride , area filled with food stalls. Outdoor and indoor seating. Met and greeted by vendors trying to sell you their food. Menus placed in your hands or on table . Not overly pushy which is nice. Wonderful aromas ...We found a table outside , sat down to have a drink and soak up the atmosphere ...Ended up with roti at $20 which was a little overpriced but delicious.. extremely wary trying the satays as one of our group is allergic to prawns. However after watching and then reassured by stall holder that prawn satays were cooked at a seperate stall.Chicken and beef satays enjoyable and satay sauce to die for! Street closed at 7 pm .. more tables and chairs placed in the street and the crowds flock in for more food.Enjoyable evening...
4
Only had one night transfer in Singapore and wanted some market food.Caught a cab there, the food stalls are well known so easy for the taxi driver to find. I had an oyster omelette and carrot cake thus satisfying my tastebuds .It also re visited memories of other Singapore visits and it was a good choice for our short stay
3
The place is in the middle of the business district. It's unique to see this old market in an ultra modern point of Singapore. We were there for dinner ordered satay from a stall 3, satays came cold! Too sweet (like eating caramel) and the meat quality was poor, S$28, I wouldn't call that an offer! They did reheat it for us. The rest, mini fried squids (also too sweet), cereal prawns was all right, the vegees too. Pretty disappointed in all. Will go there again because I like the place, but just for a drink
5
The best satay and chicken dishes noodles, rice and more. This is a real gem. You can try many different dishes and easily find somewhere to sit. We had a couple of pushy men trying to sell us stuff but they soon backed off. We got several different dishes to share and loved it. We returned a few nights later. It was good.
5
Lovely architecture, great food, and open all night long. We went there close to midnight and a lot of stalls were still open, giving us plenty of choices. Some food are a bit expensive, but all in all, it's a great place to visit.
5
Best satay is mutton satay and beef, but I think the price of $36 for small size is a bit expensive. For us it is Ok for once in a lifetime
5
Great hawker with many choices near our hotel! We walked over and ate at least 2 or 3 times. We had a breakfast/bakery spot one morning and Thai food one evening. I would recommend it.
4
The hawker centre has a very wide variety of stalls and foods on offer. Was recommended to eat the Chilli Crab and it didn't disappoint.
4
Very nice food from all far east: thailand, china, india, corea...and plus is very cheap. You can have a very good meal for 7/8 euros. Absolutely to try satay and chiken rice!Very nice location, an island of food sorrounded by skycrapers. Just a little walk from subway station Telok Ayer
4
Great hawker centre in the middle of the city. Many choices available from numerous food stalls. Some of my favourites are the beef ball noodle, pigs organ soup, thunder tea rice and dumpling stalls. In the evenings they close of boon tat street and put tables out for the satay stalls. Only downside is that it has lost a bit of character since the renovation.
3
Nearly every local recommended Lau Pa Sat for a satay experience, apparently the best in Singapore. It is great to dine outside on the closed off street, watching everything go down, and if we were to visit again I feel we would do better by ordering something else besides the satay. The food certainly was not cheap, by Hawker food centre standards, as our 10 chicken, 10 beef and 10 prawn skewers set us back $40.00. The satay skewers were all overcooked and the beef ones were so tough and chewy they were almost inedible. To top it all off, we purchased from stall 7&8, supposedly the best of the satay traders.An experience nonetheless, and I would definitely return to sample some of the many other dishes from the other traders - I would however not bother with the satay again, as we had much better satay sticks from a stall holder in Chinatown. Also, we were dudded with our lime juice drinks, which were only sickly cordials, certainly not freshly squeezed juices as they were touted to be.Bring your own serviettes
3
This is one of the famous Singapore Hawker centers, been here for years. Was here 10 years ago.But I feel that now due to tourist demands it lost some of its touch.Went there for some satay and lord it was expensive, 42 SGD for a small set. Maybe because it is because of what I had in mind before I went but that price is a bit steep for me and my girlfriend.Tip: When you get there, different food stall seller will come up to your face and "throw" their food stall's menu at you when you sit down and sometimes they follow you until you get a seat. Food maybe all look tempting to buy but wait and think about if the price is worth it for what you will get. Don't feel bad to tell them No sorry for not buying anything from their food stall
4
Lau Pa Sat is one of Singapore's great landmarks in the heart of the city. Lau Pa Sat is a Hawker market or food center boasting a wide variety of local delicacies from Chicken rice, char siu bao, and my personal favourite char siew wonton noodles.At night the street behind Lau Pa Sat closes to become 'Satay Street', full of local satay vendors firing up their grills and setting tables and chairs in the street. Local tip: Best Stay 7&8 is our favourite of the Satay vendors. The stay sauce also goes well with roti prata which can be ordered from the Indian stall at one of the road - but order this first as it takes quite a while to be prepared and delivered to your table. For Chicken Rice I head to Chicky Fun
5
Been here several times ever since my friend moved nearby. tried the BBQ fish just outside the stalls right on the street terrace but found it VERY EXPENSIVE and overrated, actually a hoax, so please avoid. 48 Singapore Dollar (30 Euro) for a 4 giant shrimp garlic dish is TERRIBLE! It was good, but heavy overpriced. For example, an average full meal dish in the stalls inside costs approx 5 Singapore Dollar!You can try a variety of cuisines, they are all good, and often spicy, I personally prefer the indian vegetarian dishes in the middle of this market, they were all very good and sooo delicious as well as spicy.If you go for Omelette, may I suggest you avoid Oyster Omelette. It's not the taste Europeans would expect and it was not a delight experience, other than that go for all you like. Prices, except for that fish BBQ are quite moderate and worth eating here. Noons gets very very busy due to offices around
5
You will find majority of Asian food here.
Filled with food stalls of chinese, korean, Indian etc food.
food is quite cheap. you can have Indian food for around 6-8 sgd.
Loved delhi express and swaad.
4
Food variety is unbeatable and cheap; place is very clean....(and I must say the cleanliness of the Singaporean hawker centres really impress me). While you are enjoying your meals here, look up and admire the green cast iron frame ...very pleasant experience indeed.
4
good upper class hawker near the cbd. went here for lunch for a business friend reasonable prices, quick services and good Singaporean food.
5
Variety of food and drink offerings. Visited on a Saturday and it was not busy at all. Prices reasonable, the Indian food and fruit juices were very tasty.
5
This is the Hawker Centre we eat at most whilst visiting Singapore. It is in an easy location next to Telok Ayer MRT station (about 5 min walk) and is set in a really nice building with quite a bit of history! Have a read online if you fancy! It is very noticeable, on the corner of the street (turn right out of telok ayer and walk until you see it!)it is very clean with a variation of food to choose from; including Indian, Chinese, English, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Japanese and many more. There are also drinks stalls selling iced and canned drinks. Of an evening the street nearby (Boon tat street) converts into 'Satay Street' which is a must if you like Satay! there are several stalls cooking and selling satay and the street is closed off and tables are put out. (see separate review)We eat at Mama Thai several times- my partner couldnt get enough of the Green Thai Curry and i had Pad Thai several times and Chicken Pineapple Rice too. We also had the Indian to the right of Mama Thai which did a really godd Biriyan (sp)!meals were around $5-6 SGD and drinks were $1-$1.50 each. really do recommend this place and i wish i could go back now and eat there!
5
Nestled with its history against amazing skyscrapers, this place is the best of Singapore, a fusion of old and new. The meals are cheap and the variety is vast. It is one of those must see places, too busy during business lunch hour but at other times are great. A great living piece of history and culture
5
On my visit to Singapore, this was my favorite of the hawkers centers. It seemed the newest and the cleanest, we came for lunch on a Saturday and it was pretty dead though we arrived pretty early, maybe around 11am. There were tons of stalls and options were endless, we found this place on the last day before we were leaving which is unfortunate, I would have returned here had i known about it sooner. It was pretty close to some shopping malls, so after overeating I took a walk around to help digest. I will be coming back here when i return to Singapore for sure
4
If you want local food, local experience hawker center this is the place. Situated in the heart of CBD the location is very convinient. But because of its location, lunch time in the weekdays can be really crowded with working professionals. Prepare some cash they dont accept cards.
5
Take the blue line to Telok Ayer MRT and take the Cross street exit and walk about 5mins to the food hall (Near Sofitel), from the station.There is a wide variety to choose from (Indian to Japanese). We had Indian, great good, cheap, and tasty! Went back again and couple of nights later, and had more! Enjoy
4
Went with family and friends on a Friday night and do go quite regularly to Lau Pa Sat. A must visit establishment in downtown Singapore. It is best to go in the week, not all the stalls are open at the weekend and it is not very busy then.Tried all kinds of classic Singapore dishes ... hokkien mee prawn noodle, oyster omelette, fish ball noodles, cockles and sambal. Washed down with some watermelon juice and green apple juice freshly blended.Great atmosphere lots of hustle and bustle. Relatively clean. Got chatting to an Irish chap who was in Singapore for the first time and sampling all the local dishes. Good way to spend an evening
5
As in any hawker center you cand find a great variety of food but the great location and the quality of food, make Lau Pa Sat a must see spot for tourists. Also the satay stalls are amazing.
5
Here is the place that you can have a lot of variety of food. You can try local food, japanese, asian food, indian, bbq, seafood and in the end I recomend to try the deserts, cold or hot, as you wish
4
What at first seems chaotic, proves to be a well-oiled machine in practice. Great for satay including wonderful prawns. A large variety of ethnic foods available for lunch, dinner and late night. Great for groups!
5
Great experience as this hawker offers both indoor and outdoor dining areas. So much variety... from local dishes to other Asian cuisines (dimsum, Viet, Indian, Turkish...)! Sometimes vendors very persuasive in approaching visitors, but other than that 10/10
4
This is the place where I tend to bring my tourist friends all the time for a good singaporean lunch/dinner feel. Its a hawker center but it still has a different ambience that makes it a good tourist attraction.
3
There are many food courts in Singapore and while this one is very pretty, it also feels very tourist and slightly overpriced. If you want the authentic experience go somewhere else.Having said that, stop by here for a snack, maybe a milk tea, while you take in downtown Singa. Its a nice spot nonetheless and gets quite busy in the evenings. There are some good dumplings and bao'
2
We first visited Lau Pa Sat Markets in 2015 and were very excited with the buz, food and atmosphere. This time around we were disappointed. Satay sticks were over cooked, Prawns were burnt and it just didn't have the same feel. There was no love put into the food. Very tired and over rated. We were recommended Maxwell Food Centre (refer separate review) which was amazin

We went here for a late dinner after work. This worked out really well because it's so hot and humid and the market is open so you wouldn't want to eat in the sun. At night they close some of the streets and place tables out there as well which is where we sat. We had chicken, prawn and beef satay. All three were great. The portions are very generous and the prices were reasonable. If you want the satay make sure to tell the people who are serving tables and they will bring over a menu where you can order it from. I don't believe the satay can be ordered in the main food hall but I don't know.

First time i go this place with my family... Many food at here. We choose : - rice with pork from philipenes ( nice pork)-laksa noodle -roti dosa from india-noodle with fish (special from singapore) I thinks all good. Price little bit higher. But we can find alot of food different with other food court. Cheers..

In the day , a stroll through this historic iron beautiful building will leave you with photographic opportunities besides having a taste of local delicacies in this largely a large food hall. At night , this area converts into a street food mall with the many more food stalls. A great way to see and eat through local specialties
4
Great place in the center to enjoy great food with friends!
Diverse food and great location are the best things this offers and while none will be the best of your life it does make for a great night in town.
5
Finally went to Lau Pasat for Satays and it was awesome. The food variety is extremely extensive and reasonably inexpensive.
4
Pretty clean, lots of choices, and on an Sunday night it was easy to get a table. We had the Satay sticks from Number 8 stall, some Chicken rice, Pork Char Siew, and some sesame icecream, All of it was good value.
5
Had the satays from 3/4 place been going here past few years I come to Singapore mainly for them the best and friendly service
4
Good spot for a snack, the food is ok, but the ambience is great! proper singapore in here :) Eat the gyoza.

Singapore has a number of great hawker centres selling various local delicacies. The Lau Pa Sat hawker centre was recommended to us by several taxi drivers. We had told them we were looking for great satay and were going to Satay on the Bay. They all told us that satay there was more expensive and not as good as that at the Lau Pa Sat centre, corner Boon Tat Street and Robinson Road.First impressions were that it is a huge centre selling a vast array of food at very cheap prices (by Western standards). The building itself is quite historic. It is 120 years old made from cast iron frames once imported from Scotland.We were there on a weekend and as night began to fall, nearby secondary roads were closed off and even more tables and chairs placed in the extra space.While we were tempted by many different foods, we were there for the satay: sticks of marinated chicken or meat skewered on sticks, cooked over charcoal fires and served with a spicy peanut sauce and pieces of onion and cucumber.Both Indonesian and Malaysian satay styles are available. If you have a preference, make sure you're buying from the right stall owner (you don't go to the stall, the stall owners and workers come to you where you are seating).We bought too much and consequently ate too much. I thought the satay I used to buy on roadsides in Malaysia back in the 1960s was better, but that may be because my jaded taste buds are getting older.Having said that, we really enjoyed the meal.Cost? Our 50 sticks of mutton and chicken satay cost us $35 Singapore. A glass of Tiger beer to wash it down cost an additional $5.50 (beer sellers come from different stalls to the satay)
4
In my view, no better or worse than any other hawker center in Singapore. Well located in the CBD though so, if it's your closest hawker center, then go for it and enjoy. On weekends and public holidays, part of adjacent Boon Tat Street is closed to traffic and the satay sellers set up their stalls, which adds another dimension to the Lau Pa Sat experience. The range of food available in the center is huge and, almost invariably, the prices are ridiculously low. Perversely, the best food is available when the center is at its busiest. When the crowds die down, some of the food on offer can be a little tired. No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to a hawker center and Lau Pa Sat is as good as any
4
Had a delicious plate of Singapore chilli crab at one of the seafood vendors on the outside of the market facing Sofitel So hotel. Ordering the fluffy rolls to dip into the sauce is a must, as is buying or bringing your own wipes from the people roaming the markets as we discovered after getting elbow deep in crab! The public toilets in the centre also do not have toilet paper so handy for that also
5
So many options, it blows your mind. Had lunch here, I went for the dim sum and buns while the wife had thai noodles. Food was very nice, service is quick, its a bit crowded especially at lunch time. Make sure to carry your own serviettes. Well priced and easy to find. Will go again
5
It was amazing day today that I manage to get some decent and tasty Vegetarian at 1.30pm today at Vegetarian stall, Lau pa sat. Despite the odd timing for lunch, I can get some juicy, savoury vegetarian food with huge portion and reasonable price. They also offer free soup Is really great to learn and having a hearty meal today since I was late with no breakfast and filled to handle all the complaint cases
4
Great location in the middle of downtown, also much better atmosphere than other similar food courts in the area. The food itself at most places is just about good.
4
This place is a very typical place to feel the multicultural spirit of Singapore. During the lunchtime and after the working day, all the employees in the skyscrapers around come there.
3
Can try different local food here, satay, Hainan chicken, laksa and Bak Kut Teh. Prices are also reasonable.
3
Went there as a group of 8 at lunch-time. Managed to get seating together after some time. Quite a lot of choice so everyone could get what they preferred but no roti canai and the sugar cane juice was very watery. Caters to office workers in the area so not as cheap as other hawker centres in local market
4
An interesting experience to eat among the locals. Certainly there are a lot of food to experience. We ordered the satay which was delicious. My wife ordered their local noodle which was very good and our children had some toasts. A good mix of food choices at a very cheap price. We are glad we took the effort to come
3
Take time to read the history and admire the frieze work just under the roof. Great location and interesting shape and architecture. I'm glad they saved this lovely market and convereted it to this food court or hawker center. Large selection of local and regional food, from Japanese bakery to Korean and Thai food, local seafood. I've not tried the satay here! It is mostly not airconditioned and it is hot
3
We had yong tau foo and wanton noodles, cha siu and roast pork rice. Only the roast pork is worth writing about.Then we went to delicius for dessert - pricey with pleasant service. It's airconditioned which helps as hawker centre is warm, even though huge fans are working
5
My wife and I visited Lau Pa Sat on a Friday evening around 8.30pm. We found a Japanese and Korean stall within Lau Pa Sat hawker market and both ordered the chicken katsu curry. It was very tasty. For dessert we initially shared some shaved ice from a stall in the middle of the complex with red ruby sago which was delicious, so much so we went back and got another one. We met friendly locals who also gave us some of their homemade banana bread. Overall, excellent and very cheap. We would definitely return.
5
During my stay in Singapore I pretty much ate exclusively at hawker centres. It's cheap, huge selection of food variety, and there's always one near you where you are. I think this is my favourite one out of all the ones I visited because it's a huge place with lots to choose from. The price is also extremely affordable
5
Went with some friends visiting on last Saturday. Always use the stalls between 6-8 because the prawns and the satay sauce is the best. Best to sit near the end as the smoke from the BBQ s can be a little smoky at times. The beef, chicken and prawn set is the best. It is a great venue to show the Singapore city at its best,eating in the middle of skyscrapers is a great view and it is where we always take our visitors. There are some people that always are going to have a say about smokers smoking at the table, but hey it is an outside venue so suck it up and stop whining or go elsewhere, plenty of choice!Bring your own wet wipes and tissues as stalls do not provide them. It do get messy. The tiger aunties selling Tiger Beer at $20 a jug, plastic cups provided. Have a pleasant evening
5
This is a place that you can eat and eat. Sate, Fried chicken, BBQ stingray, wantan noodle, chicken rice, western food, cha kway tiao, fruit juice, ..... come here, eat!
5
Visiting a country without testing local atmospheres is a pity.
The food choice is huge. The prices are unbeatable and the quality was pretty good.
Must seat on the street to really feel the atmosphere.
This is a must give a try in Singapore
4
This place is close to work and I like going there at lunchtime as it is a welcome escape from the air conditioned office and everyone can pick their preferred meal from their hawker of choice while still sitting together in the shared space.
3
There are much more options available but unlike a regular hawker centre, touts are present here albeit very restrained. Lots of local cuisines like satay, fried kwey tiao, various seafood dishes, western, korean, indian, chinese etc etc. The place also operates differently in the day time vs the night time. If one is a 1st time visitor, the night-time version being more vibrant would be the recommended time to visit if time is limited. Ample seating spaces available too
4
This is my 5th visit to Kau Pa Sat and it has allways been a great experience with visitors from outside Singapore. Our favourite is satey's from 7 or 8. On Saturday we had a table of smokers smoking while they were even eating.....no consideration for others. Check you are not sitting near smokers and to the organisers you need to great separate zones. The heckling from other stall owners is getting out of hand to. Suggest if you go only order from those associated with a stall. T-shirts are a good at identifying them. Enjoy
4
After seeing television programmes showing Lau Pa Sat, we were a little bit apprehensive as to whether the food court still has the same atmosphere as before the renovations. I am glad to report this it does ,which is one of the main reasons for eating here.Everything is cooked to order, as is the same for most food courts. The prices are unbeatable, as is the quality of food
5
Great satay!!! This hawker food center closes a side street and sets up Satay stalls only at night. We ordered the Satay shrimp, chicken beef from section 7 & 8- great flavors the shrimp was my favorite, served with a very nice peanut sauce. You have to remember to bring your own wipes because the hawker centers do not provide napkins. However, guys walk around trying to sell them to you.We also ordered carrot cake - not at all what u would think carrot cake should look , or taste like - it is made out of white radish and eggs! They add a garlic red sauce on top it was AWSOME!!! Very nice flavors totally recommend trying!
2
If you are a bit sensitive in the tum I wouldn't risk this spot. It is interesting to see but I like to understand what is in my meal. The description and pictures left me wondering. As I can't have spicy food, trying to determine a good meal was impossible.I really did try to find something .. even watching the popular stalls to see what others were ordering but the more I observed, the more I saw of the poor hygiene and handling of the ingredients and it put me off. In the end I sat with my partner while he had Indian from the market. I tried a bit of his chicken but after the first bite I realised it was completely raw in the middle. Ahh well. It was a very cheap and low calorie evening for me.
4
Some people who are quite some time in Singapore now told me that Lau Pa Sat was even better back in the days but I like it a lot just the way it is. It might be a dollar or two more expensive than other hawker centers but nevertheless, I like to come here especially with guests who are lot used to Asia yet. You've a wide variety of food (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Turkish, Costa Rican, Indian etc.) and the food court itself looks quite nice. You should definitely check this one out (amongst others).
4
The grand dame of hawker centers is also the "prettiest". It has a Victorian look and feel - and after her renovation, is now much cleaner. Situated just across our office building, we have bought our lunch here several times (we find it too warm and lacking of ventilation to enjoy our meals onsite). Aside from the usual Chinese, Singaporean and Indian fares, they provide varieties in their Filipino and Thai food, too. Price for regular lunch meal is around SGD6++ but expect to pay more for more premium items (prawns, etc). Lau Pa Sat can be reached via MRT with exits at Downtown and Raffles. Try to beat the lunch crowd and enjoy
3
A food court with lots of local food choice, from satay to seafood, bak kut teh, momochacha, kaya toast... a one stop for all of you have limited time but want to taste more.
5
Great choice of restaurants, good food at budget prices and always seems popular. For me one of the best Hawker's market in Singapore and my favourite for Indian food.
5
Your going to love this, lots of food shops all together with hundreds of tables... Most foods were around $4 to $5....Great variety & very good quality...Opens at 6am...Take the train to Telok Ayer station...
4
Its a must do while in Singapore.
Don't miss it👌👌👌
Food incredible good and prices than are very good!
3
While the satay stalls and general ambience are still good, it used to be so much better. A jug of tiger and a selection of dishes from the various stalls was always the first thing on the list of must dos's on a visit to singapore. then they cleaned it up. and added retail outlets. and ruined it. the food is good, but, except for the been there done that aspect, most of the other hawker stalls you come across are better, more authentic and more enjoyable. there was an element of perceived danger, the stalls looked like they hadn't been cleaned in 100years, when ordering food but the taste was unbeatable. now it is clean, tidy, sanitied and lacking the realism. worth a visit, between 10 & 11 pm are good times to go, but a mere shadow of its former sel
3
We have visited Las Pa Sat on every visit to Singapore, I really don't know why we return, probably more for the atmosphere than the food. We went this time for a purpose, to get Satay. The Satay stalls are situated all at one end of the complex, and at 7pm the adjacent road is closed off. The smell and the atmosphere is amazing, smoky frantic satay cooking for a number of outlets. But that is as good as it gets. We waited around 35 minutes for our satay order. When it arrived it was cold, tough and much too sweet; as was the peanut satay sauce. Having thought we'd just been unlucky, we ordered again from another stall. This one was promoted by an Australian TV Chanel 7 food show, the stall had advertised this and displayed a screen shot of the show on a poster. Again, we waited 30 minutes, and again, the satays were cold, chewy and far too sweet. The sauce was sickly sticky sweet, and both orders came with a couple of old dry slices of onion and cucumber. Looking around, many others did not look like they were enjoying their satays either.We also had a dish of chicken rice which was pleasant enough, but nothing different to many of the food courts around the island. When we spoke to our relatives who live in Singapore about where to get good Satay, they also said ah no, not Lau Pa Sat, or Newton Hawker centre, just for the tourists...So as a tourist with a short stay in Singapore, It is worth a visit, but I would not order Satay from here
5
This is the Old Dame of Hawkers in Singapore and is amazing. Recently renovated it is clean and very well kept.There is every kind of food you can imagine here and not just Asian (as good as that is).There is also an outside row of Satay Stick 'Shacks' and they are sensational.It's right in the heart of the Financial District so is a little more price than Ines that aren't but still very cheap!Enjoy
3
Not the best hawker food in Singapore. We tried several dishes from different stalls, but have to say there are many better places to grab some good hawker food. Much better selection at Newton for example or any food republic in Singapore. Seating is nice though and not too hot with lots of fans throughout. Didn't try the satay but it is certainly a nice set-up outside and makes for a holiday atmosphere. Won't rush back soon though
2
I had a feeling this place is not authentic at all! Are any locals actually eating there? When we were there, only tourists were around. And we thought we'd be so much better off eating at any of the Food Republics than this place! We tried food at 3 different stalls and we weren't impressed regarding the quality and flavours. Service also was not helpful at all
4
Really great hawker food market, choices on the inside are brilliant. The Indian classic stall inside is brilliant but u need to get the chicken & meat sticks from outside this is a must, number 7 stand was great & u can smell the charcoal flavor in the air it is fantastic.Recommend this place for dinne
5
Great location right in the middle of city and close to an MRT. This place offers a huge selection of excellent cheap food, massive range and very good quality. Whole place is nicely set up and clean. Worth visiting a few times.
4
Affordable
Variety
Continental, Italian , American,
Indian , Singaporean , Thai , Korean , Japanese , Chinese
4
The Satay at 'Best Satay' was tasty and reasonably priced. The market itself was busy & had a great atmosphere. Only problem was that it was quite messy & people were trying to sell you things while eating, which was quite annoying. Stalls 7&8 for Satay are outside!!
5
Came across this by accident when visiting the Marina Bay Sands . We took the bus from Orchard Road which stopped right outside the hotel. We wandered through the shopping mall and followed the signs for food. What a lovely surprise, we were like kids in a sweet shop. We found our table and left someone in charge, then had a wander around to see what we fancied. We chose freshly made Pad Thai and were given a pager to let us know when it was ready. Had not heard of the Hawker Centres before but would definitely go back. Great to share your table with other people, apart from the food envy
5
This venue is a must for all visitors who enjoy one style of cuisine or all styles of cuisine! Under one roof, there are so many different choices. Central rendezvous for drinks. Tables galore which are kept clean and clear by a small army of workers who work tirelessly. It is used by many locals and tourists alike. Good value for money and one way to enjoy the Singaporean cosmopolitan culture in one place. If you visit once, you will go back again ...and probably again !
4
We headed here for lunch and the experience of eating at a hawker market, having been recommended this one over all the others by a European local. Sunday is not the best day to go. Not all the stalls were open, and more importantly the satay ones were all closed. There's a wide range of cuisine available from Italian through to Japanese, and the building is the original Victorian structure which is worth seeing as part of the area's history. We need to return to try the satay as this is what, I believe, this particular market is well known for.
4
I loved this food market. We got ramen and kway teow noodles and the food was delicious. It's always nice to watch your food get made in front of you. Prices were around $6-8 per dish and you can score some pretty cheap beers here too.No air-con so prepare to sweat whilst eating but it's all part of the Singapore experience
5
At night the area around the central food court is closed off and a basic, but cool street eat scene appears. Guys buzz around trying to get you to sit near their stall and sample there food and as your butt hits the chair, ladies arrive with beers on tap to get you started. It's a great place to sit and sample some more amazing food (is there a bad place to eat in Singapore?!) and whilst busy, it's not overwhelming. The satay here is fabulous. Whether it be beef (my favourite), chicken, pork belly or prawn; it's excellent. Head inside to order up some more and again all that comes your way is good. You're walking distance to Club Street for those great roof top bars and good options in Boon Tat Street.Cool place; give it a try.
5
We had read that Stalls 7 & 8 were the best in Lau Pa Sat. Last week my wife Kate and I visited Lau Pa Sat and as we walked in to the building we were surprised at how empty it was. Then a chap asked us if we would sit at his tables and we told him that we had heard that stalls 7 & 8 were good. Immediately, he led us out of the building and in to the street where it was HEAVING with people. Men in Red shirts were directing custom to tables and they were taking orders (not what we expected as we were led to believe we would have to order at the stall ourselves). My wife doesn't like fish so we opted for 10 Mutton, 10 Beef and 10 Chicken, each with a Satay Peanut sauce and all for $22 Singapore dollars. Then for another $2 dollars, a man sold us some wet wipes. Then one of the many ladies dressed in Blue Tiger Beer shirts sold us drinks - I had a Tiger Beer and my wife had water at around $10 for both drinks. Unbelievably cheap and really good food. The people serving were excellent and I promised them a review, so here it is. We will be back when next in Singapore
5
Have always loved the satay here. This time we sat right outside stall 6 where I think they have the best satay! The ambience was great and watching them work was an experience in itself! He was in the zone while they served hundreds and hundreds of different satays. The prawns were amazing! You must go
5
This is the pace in Singapore to kick back and relax. A ton of various food stalls serving up every cuisine imaginable.
Quiet a few stalls close over the weekends as the food court caters to the working office crowds too.
5
Great food in a very clean and busy location. The range of food was good and reasonably priced. Plenty of seating and clean toilets. Not as big as Newtons Circus but still had that 'locals' feel.
5
Great selection of local fare, including Chinese Thai Malay Indian Vegetarian Seafood. Local beers & soft drinks available plus tasty desserts
Must do when visiting
4
i enjoyed the street food scene at night that I went there 3 times in a week. Food is good. Enjoyed the food selection very much.
4
They had everything here, even Coast Rican food. When we were there there was a satay competition outside as well. This place is not air conditioned but there are fans. The food was great.
5
I have been to a few hawker centres including Maxwell and Newton. This is my favourite one. Food is a bit more up market and slightly dearer as well and cleaner environment. Peak hours are during lunch times on weekdays. Can be hard to find seating.
4
Tug away in the middle of the business district.this iconic building housed food from all over. You will be surprised at the site & at the same time satisfy your cravings. Just take a taxi & ask for Lau Pa Sat ( old market) or just take the train to Raffles Place & take a slow walk to this iconic building. Definitely worth visiting for food lovers. Be it Day or night. Highly recommended
5
We loved this place. The food is sooo good and so cheap. Satays were amazing and the smell of the cooking is divine. There are lots of stalls to choose from and they all looked fairly busy. It's a pretty crowded, hectic place but a really positive atmosphere. There are lots of tourists here, but there seems to be many locals too. The satay hawkers will try to entice you to their stalls but it is lighthearted. We had the satay from 7 and 8 and the people who ran it were amazing. Thy brought huge smile to our faces. I would eat every meal at this hawker market if I could. Highly, highly recommend.
4
41sgd for prawn beef lamb and chicken satay Food was nice from STALL 7/8 There are a few touts but go straight and order from the stall. The road closes and the BBQs are set up around 7pm Take your own tissues and wipes as non are provided and there are people trying to sell you tissues. There is also a great food court next to this road and the food looked lovely Enjoy
3
The closed street Satay area at Lau Pa Sat evolved from the old Satay Club on the corner of the Padang. It might be a tourist area not needing repeat busines. We dined at the more famous stalls and found that the satays were all overcooked and dry. It seems that this is the norm.Having visited the place for many years I have no desire to return.Maybe I will try the new area in the Gardens, Satay by the Bay
4
We asked our taxi driver for a food area which was popular with the ordinary Singaporean and he took us to Lau PaSat. The experience was great food at a very affordable price, and we enjoyed a selection of food which was very tasty.
4
Excellent range of the usual hawker foods - bonus is the Satay Street adjacent which opens at nights. Quite clean and well-serviced, with plenty of seating under good fans.
5
Most visited place for Asian Culinary Experience in Singapore. Surrounded by many business offices and commercial buildings. Nearest hawker centre from SGX Building, Price Waterhouse Coopers Building, SGX Tower I and Tower II...
3
An open air food court with a great variety of food. Gets crowded during lunch hours on weekdays since its in the business district.
4
Enjoy good food and a lot to choose from.Don't let behind the satay, shrimp, beef, chiken.A 26 combo is about $26 dollars not to cheap but affordable.I found is one of the best hawker centers in Singapore as well clean.
4
Interesting to have a lunch or dinner there, a lot of choice and reasonable prices.Admire the old construction made in Glasow long time ago.It was used as a market long time ago. try the satays they start as from 18.30 street will be closed for traffic as from 19.00 hrs. Enjoy the mix of people certainly not only tourists who are enjoying their food in this historical place. Easy to reach by MRT stop Raffles city. A short walk to the Lau Pa sat
5
I ate my my across Singapore and found this place in the Heart of the City. Such a variety of tasty cuisine from all over the region.I highly recommend at stop here for anyone visiting Singapore.I think I went here 3 times during my stay.Too much to try to go just once
4
Lau Pa Sat is the only restaurant open on weekends near our hotel at Asia Square. There are plenty of food stalls around with variety of cuisines to choose from. On weekends, the street near the Pavillion is closed to give extra sitting for the crowd. The place is clean and smells good. For those who cannot stand the heat, there are some stalls that have airconditioners. I see many come here to order cold beer and satay. Most come in groups of 5 or more to enjoy good and affordable local and other international cuisines. I think this is one of the local food spots that tourists must try. If you liked Makan Sutra Food Street. You will definitely enjoy Lau Pa Sat as well.
4
On a warm steamy Sunday evening as we arrived in Singapore for a week of work, what better way to start than by chowing down with the locals.A 5 min walk from The Westin was the Telok Ayer Market where out on the streets, the famous Chinatown stallholders set up tables, fire up the fires and serve sizzling hot spicy food with refreshingly cold beer.Or you can sit inside under the ornate pergola that covers the market which is very popular for the working day lunch crowd seeking local cuisine.Great location and great fun
4
Right in the heart of CBD, this is a colonial building which serves as a giant food center. There are dozens of stalls to choose from all with different cuisines. Living in Singapore we go there all the time.Avoid weekday lunchtimes as it can get very busy from the office workers. Also on Sundays some of the stalls are not open, although there is still a good amount of choice. There are coffee stalls, fresh juice stalls and beer stalls as well. Simply look around, identify what you want to try, order, pay and collect from the stall.This place is not as cheap as some food courts in Singapore, but I find the quality is better and the ambience of the building with its fabulous architecture is not to be missed.On our last visit I had Hokkien prawn noodles, a kind of Singapore classic while my daughter has a Japanese miso ramen
5
Try the bbq prawns and meat skewers. They are quite good. Too cool down try a sugarcane drink or some shaved ice dessert.
5
Quoted as the biggest hawker in SG u can have a variety of cuisine in here weather chinese indian you name it its here and good news is aforadable and sumptous! My fave in particular is their satay!!.
5
Lots of great food here - crab, fish soup, sea food soup and excellent deserts at very affordable prices.
5
Spoilt for food choice in Singapore, but this multi-restaurant food court in an historic building gives you a great choice. However, like us, you'll probably opt for Satay Street next door. Stall 7&8 best option for your satay meal with the necessary roti prata. Great fun and valu. Buzzing
5
Great food market with about 30 different stalls around the edges doing good cheap food with seating in the middle. best to visit at night when they close off one of the adjoining streets where satay vendors produce food to be eaten at tables in the road, Great experience
4
Fantastic place to go, where the street is closed so the tables are set out to allow eveyone to experience the outdoor meal. You do get some locals selling you various bits which include hand wipes! However as there is a lot of finger food you may be happy to have them. The main food is the delicious satay. Very cheap at 70 cents per satay stick
4
This place was so memorial as before this is a bus station. This building architecture was so british gothic with the clock tower in the middle. The sound of clock bell still on till today. This building was so iconic because stand in the middle of the singapore busiest street with a lot of high rise building. The food so local but the price keep was cheap before but now already quiet high
4
There's nothing like dining or drinking at Lau Pa Sat that can give you a taste of true Singaporean gastronomic experience. Look for Auntie Alice by the traffic light post and she'll help you through the maze of hawkers. Be sure to ask for the smaller options otherwise you'll be served with the family sizes
4
We arrived at the Lau Pa Sat Hawker Centre right on lunchtime and found it difficult to get a table for 4 as it was extremely busy and filled with office workers from the surrounding financial district offices but we persevered and were rewarded with cheap and delicious food. We tried the Hainanese chicken rice, laksa, along with other Singaporean favourites. We were searching for satays but later found that satay street opens after 7pm. Would recommend avoiding the lunchtime rush if you are a tourist but overall a pleasant experience
5
I dropped in one evening and had Chicken Wanton Noodle at stall 14. It was really good and the lady behind the counter really friendly, seemed genuinely interested that I would enjoy my meal. Couple of days later returned with BF for satay which we had from stall 6. Again, the food and hospitality was great and a pretty inexpensive option. I would happily eat here every night!
4
This place has a variety of food at great prices. Best to stick to the stalls that have longer lines as the food is generally better.
5
This place was our favorite destination for having lunch or dinner during our short trip/transit visit to Singapore last February. You can found various culinary with delicious taste at one roof. I like that Singaporean Rice the most.
3
The place is recommended in all guides. It is interesting to go and eat some satay, but nothing special nonetheless and quite expensive. For the same price you find other interesting places with better views and where you dont get that smell in your clothes!!
5
Was there to meet a friend. Best satay set. Stall 7 and 8. Consists of prawns, chicken and mutton. Yummy. Mutton is so tender.
4
Lots to enjoy and all at very reasonable prices. Great, central location. Just don't try the dumplings from Bao Lumo Wan Xiang. Most of ours came cold, not a great start for prawn or scallop dumplings! Spring rolls aren't great either. Be sure to try Sunny Viet Vietnamese. Great pho and salads. Lau Pa Sat is definitely a market worth visiting when in Singers.
5
I am sure there are many many tourists who arrive in Singapore and have great dining experiences. Food is not cheap in Singapore but the quality I would say is very good. However if you are a lover of really great street food cooked freshly in front of you and at a fraction of the cost of a restaurant meal then this is the place for you, and Me !! The Hawker has been recently revamped at a cost of millions so sadly it has lost a lot of the 'authentic' hawkers who used to frequent this market. However the choice is still great and the value superb. I may just be lucky but this is our second trip to Singapore and I have eaten lunch many a time at this Hawker and never had a bad meal. Love it. It you want a real traditional Hawker then pop to Holland village. It's where our daughter and her husband used to be and the food in there is also great.

We enjoyed several different meals here during our stay and the atmosphere, culinary choices and people we met at the various stalls added to the enjoyment of our stay in Singapore. The food is very cheap comp[ared to many restaurants in Singapore and is absolutely delicious. The people preparing the food in the various stalls have a wonderful passion and verve about their food and enjoyed the positive feedback. Worth the visi

Telok Ayer, or Lau Pa Sat has been a SiNgapore eating icon for more than fifty years. Over that period it has changed little. The only adddition has really been more substatial shop fronts.In the old days stall owners employed runners who, after you had ordered from the stall, would find you and deliver your food.These days the 'runners' are touts who hold a hand full of picture cards depicting the foods of various stalls and the prices. BEWARE!....THE PRICES ARE DIFFERENT THAN IF YOU BUY FROM THE STALL YOURSELF! SOMETIMES THEY WILL BE DOUBLE....OFTEN IF YOU ORDER ONE SERVE, SAY OF 10 SATAY STICKS, AND THERE ARE TWO OF YOU, A DOUBLE ORDER WILL ARRIVE AND THE PRICE WILL BE HIGHLY INFLATED!You will not see locals buying from these touts. They know the scam and the touts don't even bother trying it on. If you are a tourist and look it, you are the perfect mark! The person who sold you the food will never be the one to deliver it. Then, if they are called out on the inflated cost, the original tout will come and claim there was a mistake.Tourists caught in this scam are often feeling intimidated, and simply pay the inflated cost. DON'T FALL FOR THIS SCAM. BUY DIRECTLY FROM THE STALL OWNER, AND THEN ONLY WHEN THE PRICES ARE DISPLAYED! IF THEY ARE NOT WRITTEN UP YOU WILL LIKELY PAY MORE THAN LOCALS WHO KNOW THE PRICES WELL.Stall owners accept the touts pulling this scam because at the end of the day the touts sell more product for them. The customers who are solicited some distance from the stall might never come close enough to buy. If you are solicited by a tout, he will sit you down and walk off. He / she does not want you to see the stall as you may notice the vast price difference to the one you have been shown on the picture card they offer you to order from.....DON'T GET SCAMMED BY THESE CHEATS. ORDER DIRECTLY FROM THE STALL AND GET A GOOD MEAL FOR A GOOD PRICE. That aftercall is what Lau PaSat is famous for

The food is good here. About $3 SGD for a meal! And very tasty! This was our local eatery, so we were going there often over the week that we stayed. The only problem is most of the staff are extremely rude (maybe they all go to 'rude' training?). If you can get past that, its great value
5
This place has an almost mythical quality to it, and deservedly so. The food choices are incredible, the architecture has a nostalgic feel, and one leaves feeling like one has truly experienced Singaporean cuisine.Arrive before "rush hour" when people go here for dinner and you'll easily find seats
4
This is a street food market in the financial district of Singapore. There is a huge variety of Asian food at very reasonable prices.
4
We eat at Lau Pesat every time we visit Singapore (which is often). Great variety of inexpensive food but we usually wind up back at satay. Stand 3/4 this time and the prawns were great. Excellent family dinner spot.
4
Definitely eat at Stall 8. The chicken satay is very nice and my parents has the prawns. Good value for money
4
Set in a beautiful building this food market is well worth a visit, with many Asian authenticity cooked dining options available at low prices. Purchase your drinks from separate outlet on site.
5
Fantastic place to go, was there just before 7pm where the satay "huts" are and watched the vendors close the street and set up their outdoor eating area. Ladies came to our table to sell beer, a gentleman was selling hand wipes, which were much needed when eating the delicious satay. Very cheap at 70 cents per satay stick
5
Is the biggest food market in Singapore, right in down town center. We were taken by a local and had dinner, 3 days after we return for lunch. All kind of Asian food. Low prices and great quality. This is were locals go. Is a must to eat or just to see
5
Very beautiful and clean hawker centre. Not many stalls are open maybe because I went there too early on a Sunday morning (9.30am) but breakfast are meant to be early for tourists as not to waste our limited precious time. But overall, I'm satisfied with the food I ordered.
5
Very unique food market. You can find all kids of food here and nicely cooked. The special part of Lau Pa Sat is that you can have the best dinner in open area with modest tables and sits but surrounded by Singapore skyscrapers .The beef, lamb and chicken satay is amazing here and also seafood as well is great and very tasty. Service is excellent and friendly. Dont miss this place during your visit in Singapore.March 18.3.201

If you can't find something to eat here, you would have to be really picky. The stalls have cuisines such as Chinese, Malaysian, Japanese, Indian, Western, and Singaporean. Everything is incredibly cheap and the portions are generous. There is a center area that you can purchase drinks at with again, a lot of variety. The calamansi juice is "Filipino lemonade" and is tart but really delicious. I ate at the Seng Kee Local Delights stall and had Char kway teow while my husband had the laksa. The Laksa is a spicy, coconut like broth with seafood and is comforting and delicious. The char kway teow was rich and flavorful with lots of bits of meat and veggies in it. Both were great and I'd totally recommend them
4
Located in the financial heart its very popular with the people who work in the offices around it. Therefore avoid it during lunch time of 12-2PM when it's going to be horribly crowded. Otherwise it's a great place to find quality food of different kinds to indulge in. Personally if I was working there I will either brunch or have a late lunch to avoid the crowds in the mid day heat sticking their elbows into my face. Staff are therefore unfriendly and in a hurry to serve and get rid of you. Not for tourists but a cheap and cheerful place if you are looking for food in the area.
4
We enjoyed a number of meals here. Great selection of menus and not too expensive. Great prata and curry.
5
Very cheap, excellent quality food and a real buzz about the place at night. Had stays from number 8 stall as well as stingray and cereal prawns. All washed down with tiger beer.
Awesome venue.

Lau Pa Sat remains to be a food icon in the midst of downtown SG. Prices are a bit higher than the common roadside restos but the difference is the convenience for the working public, near the offices, and the evening ambiance when they close adjacent roads to accommodate the appreciating crowd. One caveat for beer drinkers : it's pay upon service, but to maximize happy hour prices, mind the time, and make sure to follow up with your orders otherwise there might be a "misunderstanding" something like "see lah this is already sgd20 because no more happy hour okeh?" even when you clearly made the order much earlier but service was made much later.For satay lovers : you may want to choose from various selections. Otherwise you might be surprised of the smallish serving sizes.Give me a like! :) Cheers
5
This location is for me one of the best recommendations for Satay. And you can sit and eat on the street which normally has much traffic. Every evening at 7:00 pm it is closed and 5mins later it has been converted to a huge restaurant. You will love it
4
one of the famous place that serve great taste food with great price as well, i was hardly able to chose what shall i eat at lau pa sat. it's so hard because it was all looks delicious and cheap. and then me and my partner decide to buy laksa and some indian food (i forgot what was it called) the indian food were taste unique and good, the laksa was really really tasty. we were very satisfy and cant stop to spend our money there to buy some food and snack! absolulety a must to visit and taste if you visiting singapor
5
This is a difficult place to visit as it is a hawker market that houses a large number of tiny stalls serving all kinds of food that you are dying to try (and some that you aren't) and so it's difficult in that even if you buy the smallest portions, you still aren't even going to make a dent! You will need to go a few times; that's all!! Some tips. Have a walk around first so that you can see everything before you buy and that includes walking around the outside where you will find the satay stalls. I'm not sure that you can visit there without trying some. THe beer girls walk around and ensure that you are kept hydrated....... It's all very well done, it al very cheap and all very delicious
4
Decided to have some cold beers and satay for supper. Love this place. The satay is really yummy, i cant stop myself from eating. Service is also not bad. We're straight away attended by the guy from best satay 7&8. The feeling of being in an open air street dining is also awesome. Me and my bf really enjoyed it. Such a good place to go.
2
Been frequenting this satay place, in particularly Stall 8, for years. Either the owner had a bad day or something has changed that makes the dining experience here extremely unpleasant.I had to literally beg for the satay gravy as there were four of us and we had wanted four separate bowls of gravy. When I am done with mine, had wanted a top up of the gravy and the lady at the stall adamantly refused to give more gravy! Some begging helps but certainly I cannot imagine trying to eat fish head curry without the curry. What is supposedly an icon of Singapore's alfresco dining has to be marred by such unpleasant service attitude. It will not be my part of my dining experience for a long time to come
5
We found the recommendation on Trip Advisor - another winner!!!! Singapore is so expensive but the market was fab!! Great satay at no.7/8 washed down with Tiger beer. We then did dim sum inside the market. Can't wait to go back. Great value and sooo good
5
Every evening as of 6:00 pm, the smell of satay food being grilled attracts you from a fair distance away. Every taxi driver knows about it. The smoke tells you where it is. The choice of food being "satayed" is great. Don't want satay? Don't worry; there are plenty of other local delicacies to enjoy too. An experience to enjoy for sure. Cost: moderate.
4
This place has many food kiosks to chose from but it can be hit or miss, some are great others are average, good place to go if you are hungry and not sure what you want to have.
5
Great food in great prices. A lot of different meals from Asian kitchen. Very good location - near Marina Bay. I was very satisfied and hope to visit this place once again in the nearest future.
5
Great market! so many food choices and each looks better then the other. Definitely a feel of the local cuisine. Not a fancy place, but good food in a great busy and lively atmosphere.
5
We ate here often, as they are also open at lunch time. The satays in the evening are great especially from Stall 6, they close the road off and so we all sat at chairs and tables in the street, a great spectacle. Very inexpensive too. Some much choice and all so fresh.
4
Although the food is not the best out of all the hawker centre in singapore, the building itself looks great and in the evenings they shut off a road next to it and tons of satay stalls set up - a great place to hang out in the evening. - the food at lau pa sat can also be a bit more expensive than at other hawkers - don't bother going during the day, it only really gets going at nightApart from the satay there's good indian food, japanese, chicken rice (chicky fun) and di
5
Go at night, a bit underwhelming during the day. We visited for dinner to try local street food. The satay vendors line the street that is filled with smoke and the smell of delicious food. They tout for business and shout they are the best!! $14 for 20 assorted satay with the best sauce I have ever tasted. We enjoyed our meal here more than the very expensive options at Clark Quay....Highly recommend this as a 'must do' experience while in Singapore, the atmosphere and cultural aspect is priceless
5
We visited here after having a few in Level 33, a must do venue for beer, wine, and great views.This place is great, if you Want it they have it!Great place, and considering most patrons are business people at their lunch time, don't worry about any aspect.Great food, very quick to be served, it's a must if your Downtown
5
My husband and I loved this authentic Singaporean experience. Being from New York, we are used to street food, but Hawker Centers bring it to a whole new level. Lau Pa Sat was right near our hotel, The Westin, and was about a 5 minute walk. We actually came here for breakfast and lunch since we liked it so much. There were many local business professional people eating lunch here. The food was delicious and seemed clean despite being an outdoor dining/street food situation
4
This place have been kept very clean by the locals. The choice of food is plenty. There is a lot of local delights, do try out the tasty satay, its only made to order so that the food is fresh and delicious. Do try out the sugar cane juice it goes well with oily food
4
Very clean. Lots of food to choose from. You can go for satay and eat outside while they grill your order, or you can choose to eat inside and select from all of the cuisines. A nice place to visit when you're in Singapore looking for an authentic hawker stall experience
4
A bit smokey air, but lovely food varieties and really good atmosphere. Make sure you try their indian food. For drinks my favorite was the sugar cane juice, which you can get again in a huge variety of flavours.
4
Love this place...food at the hawkers are still good after so many years.
The buzz is crazy chaotic - just right!!!
You can est lots for a reasonable price here.
5
Excellent, many stalls with a lot of choice of food, the best food in Singapore, clean, delicious and good prices
4
A food center I would likely recommend when you visit Singapore. You can find a variety of food from different countries. If you love to eat and like to tastes different then this is the place for you. Expect a lot of people during friday night
5
On a weekend in the city which was empty we found this little treasure. Amazing range of food offerings. This classic hawkers market offers great food at cheap prices and, for what I ate, great quality. Even just walking around this quaint hexagonal building opens your eyes to such an array of cuisines. I would recommend to all but don't expect a 5 star restaurant ambiance. It is a food court style with five star food offerings
4
After about 10 trips to Singapore we finally found our way here and now wish we had been earlier. Plenty of choices of cuisine under cover and lots of booths selling sticks of satays in 'Satay Street'. We bought 5 chicken and 5 beef from Best Satays No 8 and a Pad Thai from an inside vendor and shared these with a pint of Tiger beer. Great atmosphere outside as long as you sit upwind of the smoke from the wood and coal fired BBQ's.
4
Agree with others that other hawker centers are cheaper but given the location it is a great value, tons of options, and delicious.I much prefer to come here for dinner when in Singapore on business then fancier restaurants that dot CBD but are not unique to Sing

“Lau Pa Sat” literally means “old market” in the Hokkien Chinese dialect and this historical landmark was built during the nineteenth century but was shifted once from its original waterfront location. The Victorian architecture of the building remains till today and despite its single-storey structure it has never felt threatened by all the surrounding tall buildings and skyscrapers. This market has actually been transformed into a large hawker centre since a long time ago and it is definitely one of Singapore’s proudest, open 24/7 and serving almost A to Z of Singapore’s diverse hawker cuisine. The atmosphere here seems to liven up even more after sunset, as more stalls are set up and the road behind the building is closed to traffic to allow the mostly satay sellers to set up stall and also to increase the seating space with this additional alfresco area.Most of the food stalls are operating within the confines of the open-sided building while satay stalls are outside and it’s free seating anywhere. Food can be ordered from anywhere you like and they would be brought to your table, the old style of service, unlike at most newer food courts where you would have to queue in line for your own food. There’s a wide variety of food ranging from Chinese dishes like chicken rice, fried oysters, fried noodles & stir-fried dishes to Indian, Western and Malay food like satay. Many stalls have their own runners canvassing for business and they walk around everywhere with picture menus and order chits in hand and promoting their food, but it’s always best not to order without visiting their kiosk or stall lest you don’t get what you really yearn for.For locals and tourists alike, Lau Pa Sat is a food haven where you can get hold of various ethnic food at affordable prices and above average quality. It only takes a five minute walk from the Raffles City MRT station and a definitely worthwhile food place to visit while in Singapore
4
The setting is not glamourous, but food is delicious. You sit on plastic stools and choose your food and drinks from various vendors who come around. We ate satay, which was delicious, stingray ( interesting new experience) , fried noodles, fried rice and beers. Very casual , food comes quickly. No provision for rain. A good experienc
5
What ever you want it's here, you can get a good meal for under 5SGD and many will match a 5* for quality of the food. Try the Sate and tell me you have had better, the Indian food is also great and Hugh portions... I go every week and look forward to it, so many different styles and has a great buzz.
4
Local hawker type food. Satay is the main dish. Reasonably priced but do check prices before ordering your food.
3
There are many hawker stores here. Some of them are good and some very bad. Fish ball noodle and Indonesian food here is good. Selected satay stores are also good.
4
It is definitely one of the less glamorous markets in Singapore, but in my opinion certainly one of the best. You have all kinds of cuisines to choose from, but the seating is very simple. You "get what you pay", but on your plastic plate. No table cloth, no waiter service. It is a market! Recommend you first walk through the market to see the diversity of food offered, then sit down and order your food from the hawkers. Delicious! My memory makes my mouth water....
4
Open for lunch and till late especially on weekends. However not sure if it's still Chinese New Year period or it's normal for some stalls to be closed. We got there before 11pm on Saturday night. This is a high end hawker center with a big varieties of food. So expect to pay more than regular neighborhood hawker. They have both inside and open seating area. Open seating area can be smoky as that's where the satay stalls and seafood BBQ stalls are located. Good to go in a group so you can order different stuff to try out.
3
Upon entering you are immediately swarmed by vendors, so far so South East Asia and not really the rules and regulations of Singapore. All good. The beers are incredibly expensive, but this is Singapore. The skewers of beef, lamb and pork were really tasty and the peanut sauce very moreish - apparently a minimum order of 10 is required. We liked it enough to order 20. I preferred other hawker markets that were cheaper and seemed to be less focused on tourists.
4
Situated in the city, easy to get there by MRT. Place is in a quaint old building, can be quite warm but pleasant in the evenings. Obviously a place for people to catch up and also popular with the tourists. It's a mixture of cuisines but I stuck to the local ones. Had the Oyster omelet, ice cacang and satay, all fairly good prices and deliciou
5
cheap nice roadside stall to try for malay, indian, Chinese even foreigner can pay the price. alots of choice to get from this old pasar from a century before. Must visit and love the food was so fresh and culturist.suit for family and loving couple
3
Last night I was here with friends for some Popiah and ended up with Popiah, Pie Tee (hard to explain but look at the pic), Hokkien Mie or Hokkien noodles, and Singapore Carrot Cake which made from raddish cake and eggs, very different than western carrot cake! Very affordable and the rule of thumb to choose where to order here is by looking at the most crowded place if you're not familiar with this place.
3
Selling large varieties of foods at Lau Pa Sat. The sitting capacity is huge as well. The lunch crowd during the weekdays are terrible. You can't find sitting space. Some of their foods like, duck rice, hokkien mee, fried carrot cake and etc are delicious. The price that they are selling are at premium. You would be about to get 2 serving at other hawker centers
5
Lau Pa Sat is a must do if visiting Singapore or living in the country and wanting to sample local fare. 9 of us at dinner at Lau Pa Sat and "hung out" for a few hours. All of the Hawkers are good, many provide table service, there is a great variety (although it is known for Satay) and the food is all well priced fresh and served hot
4
Four of us ate one evening.
Great place for a warm friendly meal with friends.
Satay prawns were great from stall No7-8
5
Lau Pa Sat is an experience from A-Z. It starts with the architecture, over the variety of food to the people you meet from all over the world. Must do when you are in Singapore!
5
This food market was located just outside our hotel.
It is a buzzing place with a lot of food options to choose from.
You definitely need to go there and see for yourself.
4
This is only a short walk from the waterfront area and is full of all sorts of street food outlets. Great food if very basic and incredibly cheap. Our chicken with noodles and veg cost $4.50 or Â£2.50 each! It was very tasty and well cooked and no problems. Well worth going as it will save you a lot and you will see a typical local stall area
4
A friend brought me here last time I came to Singapore on a business trip. We sat outdoors. It's noisy, everyone's screaming, there's smoke everywhere, but loved every minute of it! In addition to the hawker center, it's great that they dedicated a street outside for this. The food was great - affordable - and the atmosphere was popping. Will definitely come back and bring friends
4
You can pay a fortune in Singapore for food and drinks if you don't know your way around. China Town is the spot to go for cheap good food and when a little further afield towards the city head to this place. We were put into it by a tack driver and did not disappoint. Only a 5 minute walk from where we were staying at the Fullerton.Filled with many different food and drink stalls and very authentic and cheap.If you are wanting your bacon and eggs however don't head here. This is the real deal and serve great local food so give it a try - you may just like it. We certainly did and tried a few different dishes which were amazing, breakfast, lunch and dinner. Open till late and breakfast starts around 8:309'ish with not all opening but still enough to give you a choice other than Starbucks.
4
Eating at hawker centers in Singapore is the best way if you are on a budget. Lunch Lau PA SAT is the biggest hawker center and by far the busiest. Try it at dinner time since at lunch all the employees nearby are there so very difficult to get a seat. I liked the satay at night, live cooking and 70 cents for a stick
5
From day till dusk You have more than 60 stalls to sample food. after 10 p.m. also Satay street starts to work on one of the sides of this wonderful eateries market. Seafood and local dishes, anything You wish, You can try here. Clean stalls, efficient and friendly service. Very much recommended
2
Great location and atmosphere but 4 of us seasoned Singapore food hall lovers all had disappointing meals compared to every other food hall we have eaten at. We all had varied meals - beef noodles, chicken rice, Indian and seafood noodles. Later told by someone we should have had the satay sticks which seemed to be very popular when we there so guess we should have realised that before we ordered
4
We went to Lau Pa Sat for one reason - Satay, and it did not disappoint. This place has a great atmosphere and smell of the satay is fantastic. Many of the sellers have food packages where you can try different types of meats (beef, chicken, lamb or prawn). The sticks are small so make sure you get enough. Also they don't start serving until around 7pm. It is a an actual road before then.Make sure when you arrive you don't get taken in by the large number of stall holders trying to get you to come to your stall. Head outside and speak directly to satay stall holders. Number 7&8 have great reviews on trip advisor so we went there. There are also drink waitresses, so order up some beer and enjoy the stay
3
Pure Vegiteranian food is available on 1 or 2 joints say SWADS and KOMALS(south indian). Otherwise all sorts of non veg food is available. We can also have cut fruits for vegiteranian people.
4
Great fun out in the street and this is predominantly Satay (other foods if you don't like satay). Hawkers are a fun part. It's cheap fun eats!
4
Had a great evening eating all sorts of food off of satay sticks and drinking beer from jugs. Had a really good vibe, bustling with locals and decent food. Perfect catch up with friends.
4
Stopped by for a meal on a brief visit to Singapore. It was bustling and good value as before. It now incorporates the Satay Club
4
We visited twice on the same day. First we had a tea inside a cake shop. Just cake, drinks and ice-cream. Lovely.
Then we go back at night for dinner. Simply randomly order food from different shops and eat. Nice.
5
The place is an open dining area and it gets a real crowd during the weekends. A variety of satay to choose from! Personally, I like the beef satay best. Take note that they only serve satay in the evenings. You can find a whole lot of other cuisines as well. It's worth a visit. I would come back if I'm free.
4
Ate here inside and the food was ok - typical Asian food court but decent enough! Had a smoothie, charged extra for no ice but I didn't mind. Then went outside and got dragged to a table didn't even get to see the menu was told to order satay - he said half portion and I was ok.. then he disappeared for half an hour and some guy brought over tonnes of chicken satay and other meats. Then asked for $21 I was shocked. When he said half I thought it would be more like a snack but nope! Delicious as they were I couldn't finish them! Definitely go because the atmosphere was amazing and the food was good but just don't let them pressure you into ordering what they want - I sat outside as night feel and it was great
4
Conveniently located near to Raffles Place MRT, this food centre is popular amongst the working class in the financial district and hence can be crowded during lunch time. There are a wide variety of local food such as carrot cake, chicken rice, fried Kway Teow, fried oyster omelette, poh piah, BBQ sting ray, fish soup, etc. Prices are relatively reasonable.
5
Lau Pa Sat is a more sanitised version of a hawker market, primarily due to being in the affluent financial district and the prices are probably higher than in more local hawker places however the food is good! We had sambal stingray along with some chicken noodles. The stingray is a favourite of mine! Very tasty food.There is seating under a covered area with fans as well as an outdoor area too. At night they alos have some barbeques running on the pavement where they cook their satays!RegardsOma
5
We have visited Lau Pa Sat many times & love the atmosphere & foods enjoyed there, the food handling ratings are a great idea & true to form. Very popular with tourists & the variety of foods is amazing. Don't be put off if first you go to the closed off street at the side where the people cooking satay stickers are located & people rush up to greet you spruiking their satay sellers, be polite & after you have looked around the other food stalls inside to check what they sell, you can always go back to the tables & chairs the satay sellers put out. Don't ignore the few elderly sellers that sell small packets of tissues & wet wipes they are great to clean up your face & hands afterwards. Go to Lau Pa Sat with an open mind & you will enjoy the experience as you will the whole of visiting beautiful Singapore
4
Some of the best Satay's can be found on the street side. The food is great value for money. Is a very lively place especially when busy.
5
Somehow my review from last year didn't get posted! An absolutely incredible collection of restaurants to suit every possible taste! Loved it! Ate here virtually every meal!
5
When visiting Singapore you have to eat in the food markets, and this place is a great place to eat most kinds of asian food you could wish for. The food is plentiful cheap and good quality. You can try little bits from different parts of Asia to make up your own meal, and share a jug of Tiger beer to wash it down. I could give up meat eating in this place as the vegetarian food on offer is the best anywhere. It's warm in here, sit under one of the fans
4
We had visited this food court when we were in Singapore previously and so wanted to go back. Love the architecture of the building and the choice of food. We decided to do Vietnamese food stall and the food was very good although our duck dish was more like a soup but this was our fault for ordering the wrong dish. The food is so reasonably priced and there is such a choice of food stalls to choose from
5
This was right outside our hotel. The variety of food is enormous and everything we tried was delicious. $30 would feed two of us including a jug of Tiger beer. Can't be beaten for value, flavour and a great opportunity to eat with the locals (including some of our hotel staff!!
5
whatever kind of food you hanker for: it's here. I even seem to remember Italian but we wanted regional so I wasn't paying that much attention. I was on a personal quest for something called "Carrot Cake Black" or "Red." This dish has nothing to do with western carrot cake. The squarish chunks are really a Chinese radish, way cooked. It's combined with other stuff; tumbled into a wok with an egg or two; stirred a bit and yum. The 'black' or 'red' is because it IS dark (maybe soy sauce?) opposed to various other kinds of "carrot cake."You can get it hot (flavor) or not.I developed a taste for this dish on a Chinatown food tour. (Excellent food and city overview. And we managed it our first lagged day on the ground after 24-hour transit).I didn't see this carrot cake a lot in hawker centers etc. so was delighted to find it here.We were there mid-day: it was packed.Really great building with a truly amazing octagonal plan, roof supported by 1894 cast iron trusses. Don't get your hopes up about a historic building: only the cast iron is. Cast iron framing saved from the 1894 market when it was demo'd in1986. Current building (reconstruction) is from the late 1980s and now thrives as a super hawker center, also known as Telak Ayer Market.Conveniently located in heart of downtown on the way, here to there
5
My wife and I stayed across the road from Lau Pa Sat. The convenience and quality kept us coming back. It's not just about Satays at night (we prefer Power 6 satay but don't know the difference between them all) - we come and have congee for breakfast at Zao Wu Wan Can and local coffee as well.A lot nice and cheaper than the local western coffee shops and cafes for breakfast.Many different options inside the hall with cuisines from all around Asia.A bit touristy but locals do come here for dinner and at breakfast it is pretty much exclusively locals
5
This place is unbelievable there is that much delicious food to choose from we often found ourself grabbing a beer first and then siting down at for or 5 different places to eat a course from each !! From Japanese to Indian to chicken rice whatever your hearts desire is here all under one roof and it's CHEAP like super cheap #Winning highly recommend
4
This place is definitly nothing for peoples who love to enjoy a quite and relaxed dinner. Tons of peoples fight about their food. The food experience itself if amazing and also the satai street just behind the markethall is amazing. If you want a cheap and crazy food experience come here, it's a must on a Singapore trip for sur

I wasn't expecting much as I heard the satay weren't as good as the satay street when I was a kid. But I loved it. I visited store no 7&8 and ordered satay and we also got a menu from a local store and the food was excellent.We stayed at the hotel right next door but it was raining the second day so there wasn't anyone there but I would love to go again if I lived nearby but I wouldn't go especially for it

Came back here for some festive barbecue meal. Eating outside surrounded by tall buildings is actually a nice experience. Food is good as well but a little expensive.
5
In this lively lovely place you will find any type of Asian food you can think of: Murtabak, Indian curries (Delicious) and the best sate you will ever eat! and open till late
4
Fantastic food market with tons of tasty morsels to enjoy, have something small from as many stalls as you can to get maximum effect and sit under a fan!
4
Many international Indian, Korean, Japanese, Mexican and Chinese food choices
Value for money
Convenient location and at heart of the CBD.
Don't miss it

Had lunch and dinner there and had great meals each time. The satay especially nice and the prawns were great. Indian last night was really good. Could have been a bit hotter but good. Drinks are not what Australians call cold
5
I LOVE the concept of a hawker market so was really keen to visit one whilst on holiday in Singapore. Our friends who live there took us to Lau Pa Sat for dinner and to their favourite indian stall. There are lots of stalls all offering different cuisines - and there's also Satay street which spills out into the road and has the best satay in Singapore...or so I've heard.The food was incredible, lots of delicious options and really flavoursome sauces. All at a very bargain price of about Â£15 for two people. Probably the cheapest way to eat in Singapore.The only downside would be the lack of aircon - we were visiting in September and it was extremely humid and so be prepared to be hot and bothered
5
A hawker complex for the business district by day they then close the street around it at around 7.00pm and like magic tables, chairs and pop up satay stalls appear to delight everyone. Satayed out? ...no problem there are plenty of other wonderful cuisine to add to the table and the atmosphere is wonderfully vibrant. If travelling with children there is a lovely park with swings etc for them to run off some energy. A fabulous local experience with some of the best Satay and street food
5
Dived in here as it was raining for quick lunch. A great place to sit amongst the locals and try something from a myriad of options. There has to be something to everyone's taste and at S$5-6 if there isn't how bad can it be!? We were told it is even better to visit at night when the food tables are put in the street. Will try this next time we return.
5
We ate here after a recommendation from a taxi driver and he was right. We ate the best satay sticks. We had chicken, beef, duck & prawn satays and they were all delicious. After 7pm they block off Boon Tat Road and set up share table and chairs and the stalls cook the satay sticks fresh in front of you. There are also waiters selling jugs of beer. Not only great tasting but a cheap way especially for Singapore and you are with the locals
3
This is the oldest hawker center in Singapore. While I dont know it is very famous I think this is only regular hawker center. Most of hawker center in Singapore is just exactly like Lau Pa Sat. The stalls are not spectacular either. For me the experience is just average. I rather eat in hawker center in Mall that have air conditiner
4
A great place to go if you want to eat authentic local food. The locals eat there with their families and friends and there is a large number of food stalls to choose from for your meal.
4
Had some great dim sum late in the evening. Cheap and delicious. Recommend Bao Luo wan Xiang for the pork bau and prawn dumplings. The old Victorian building with the clock tower is a curiosity and interesting to wander around.

Lau Pa Sat is rather over-rated. In fact, I'm not exactly sure where the hype is coming from, and why this place is known to so many people.Personally, I only come here if I'm around the area, because it is the most convenient place to go to. There are some food stalls that give this place a bad name, because they are so ridiculously overpriced it actually makes the whole experience a big turn-off. For one, ordering kway chap can chalk up a huge bill for you, so stay away from that. Also, there are a lot of stall owners trying to get you to eat satay. I have never ordered from them, so buy from them at your own discretion. It is easy for them to overcharge.If you do come here though, you could try the Fried Hokkien Mee or Fried Carrot Cake from Seng Kee Local Delights. At least these are decently priced and actually taste good.If you do decide to give this place a shot, it is a short walk away from Raffles Place MRT Station exit F, or Telok Ayer MRT Station (the exit on the right)
3
I have done short stays In the Marina Bay Area on many occasions but this time, I have 10 days to kill. Lau Pa Sat is closest to me for a quick and cheap meal. To my somewhat jaded tastebuds, I must say the food here is good thought none is great. For visitors like me staying in the Bay Area, this is the only food court I knew about, til now. With more time, I quickly got tired of the same old things at LPS and started to venture further afield. If you have the time, 15 minutes slow walk will get you to Maxwell Food Centre (google to locate this place). To me, the food is better, more of the local flavour rather then the tailored dishes served at LPS and they are about half the price charged. If you want to go where the locals go, try Amoy food court (<10 mins walk from Bay Area. You may walk pass this place on your way to Maxwell. This is where the locals go. I will put up reviews of some of the dishes I have tried here. Price wise, they are even cheaper than Maxwell. Amoy may not have been renovated recently but you can be sure the food served here is clean and wholesome

I have been going to Singapore for over 30 years and never had such a dreadful experience as I had last evening in the company of 2 guests. The service was poor, especially the Tiger beer waitress who took so long after order was placed that I had to go and fetch the beers myself! The food was hugely disappointing, expensive and poorly served + the tables were not clean and the general atmosphere grim. What a shame that such a lovely old building does not have better food vendors and atmosphere, shame on you Lau Pa Sat, I have had better satays in the UK and the price we paid was equal to dinner at the Fullerton!!!!!!
5
We visited Lau Pa Sat many times during our visit to Singapore and still would like to go many more times because theres so many things to try!! We particularly enjoyed the Satay which is located just outside on the edge and is served from lots of different coloured huts. Beef chicken and prawn are all good would also really recommend the chicken fried rice too. Inside the hawker you go and get your own meal from whichever place you choose however, at the Satay stalks they will come to you and will get your goods food and drinks too. Would really recommend the Indian food there and if you can find a Rota Prata then you should definitely try it
5
It's days of being a wet market are long gone ... my grandfather used to buy fresh fish here in the 50s. Still Lau Pa Sat is an institution in the city and is worth a visit not just for food but because it is a true heritage building. Very wide selection of hawker food, and also the street next to it (Boon Tat Street) becomes a mini-Satay Club in the evenings. Good atmosphere that reminds me of the old Satay club days of the 70s
5
Was unaware of this location until told by our taxi driver on way to Gardens by the Bay, called in on return trip. It is a large cast iron building, housing dozens of different food stalls, mainly asian but you can also purchase some western dishes such a pizza, asian iced deserts such as cendol, kachang and peeled and sliced fresh fruits. Unfortunately no satay for lunch, only served in the evenings. I would not class this location as being in a tourist area. During our stay we visited twice, interestingly our local friends didn't recommend this location but we found it good, reasonably priced and Singapore clean. From here it took around 30 minutes to walk to Chinatow
5
After visiting china town and experiencing a hawkers market I was dissuaded to visit another, but decided to check out Lau pa sat as it was just up the road from the hotel. I was very pleasantly surprised. It was clean and tidy with people employed to clear table etc when vacated. There was many restaurants surrounding the eatery and as we found it on our penultimate day we visited again the next day before leaving. The chicken and rice was definitely the best. Don't bother splashing out on satay and seafood, just try something simply delicious
3
An experience one should never miss-out is a visit to the various hawkers market in Singapore. We tried the hawkers market at Lau Pa Sat and we were welcomed by the many delicacies from different cultures. It took as awhile to decide what to select from the many gastronomic feasts available, from Indian, Malaysian, Singaporean, Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Western and even Latin America but at the end, our personal preference was the deciding factor. I went for my favorite wanton noodles! The place is quite accessible and it's a short walk from the Raffles Place MRT Station. The place is huge but it gets crowded during lunch and dinner, so better come early. The cost is quite cheap compared to a meal from McDonalds. Don't expect an airconditioned venue so be ready to sweat it out especially if you are eating something hot and spicy.I could have stayed all day at Lau Pa Sat and delighted my tummy more at the expense of my diet. Of course, there's always a next time..
5
To say that Singapore is an expensive city, is an understatement...... For cheap eats and drinks, no better than to recommend Lau Pa Sat! Many options, great food!
5
We came here as two couples and ate masses of Satay and drank beers. It was brilliant and we had great fun. Highly recommended!
4
There is so much to choose from but it can be a bit of a guess as English is not always a strong suit in this food hall type environment. The beer was a tad warm but was drinkable, the food was great. There were4 of us and we all went for something different and all enjoyed. Will go back next time in Singapore
5
Situated within what appears to be the business district of the city is this excellent, modern hawker centre serving an array of food from different nations across Asia. From sushi to masala dosa, this food court had it all, and with quality to match.Whilst prices were slightly more than some of the older hawker centres in Singapore, the dishes were still affordable.Great dessert choices too, especially for bingsu lovers.We went back the following day
5
It's hard to believe there are only 4 reviews for this place. It has an excellent selection of restaurants at very reasonable prices. I had a chicken tikka masala with side vegetables for $11 and it was very good, much better value than many other places around. I have to confess I have been coming here for 35 years since it was actually on the water. Now the only trace of water is in the "quay" in Raffles Quay. It is a beautiful old Victorian iron lace building which I am glad to see has been preserved
3
Though its been renovated and refurbished a couple of times to make it a tourist attraction for foreigners, the food served here by the local hawkers are no match for those hawker fare at Maxwell Food Center.Prices of the food here are quite exorbitant and pricey for the quality and quantity of the food being served. Maxwell Food Center is still much better.Usually crowded during peak times and hard to find seating
4
Nice ambiance and location with many food selections at affordable prices. The touting hawkers really destroys the beauty of the place. They are very persistent and sometimes can be rather aggressive to the point that it gets very annoying when you have to be aggressive back for them to leave you alone. Ordered several dishes all were very delicious. Open air and close to MRT
4
Lau Pa Sat is a great place for sampling the variety of foods in Singapore. Its a relatively comfortable hawker center, very use to tourists and locals alike. A real mix of foods and qualities too. One of the most expensive hawker centers, and not consistent with the quality but still good value. A good way to break into the culture.
5
If you are new to Singapore and it's Hawker food scene; this location can be a great introduction to the food culture. Set in a beautiful refurbished colonial building, the location is clean and the variety of food is diverse. This place is enjoyed by locals working in the area and tourists. It's open 24 hrs, but best times are usually lunch and dinner time where all hawker stalls are open for business. Go try the mutton briyani, the oyster omelette, and the satays! There's lots to choose
5
Lau Pa Sat has been fully refurbished a few years ago and is probably one of the nicest hawker centers in town. Very clean and nice and airy to sit down for lunch. I have tried food on both an Indonesian stand as well as Chicky Fun and both were fresh and really good. Definitely shop around and also try the fresh fruit juices.
4
They have a lot of choices. If you want to know which one the good one is, then you should watch the queue. The longer the queue shows the better the food.
4
Has Mutton Briyani at Briyani house. Taste and quantity served was good. So many choice of food counters. Each one serving delicacies from various parts of the world. Definitely worth a visit.
5
Great place to bring visitors, or to visit! Not too busy for Friday night late dinner. Wave away the guys wandering around with menus and get the following:from Store 8: satay ("the best satay")from store 10: oyster omelette and hokkien mee (seafood fried noodles)from store 55-56: small stingray (grilled stingray with chilli
4
I always visit Lau Pa Sat once during each of my visits to Singapore. I've eaten in loads of places, but this is one of the ones I keep coming back to with my colleagues. It is very relaxed with outside seating. Food and Service are excellent. True, this really is a bit of a tourist trap, so prices are a little higher than you'd prefer, but this place is important in the history of Singapore. The smell of the satay cooking on the barbecues in the streets mixed with the hustle & bustle of traders and diners makes a great atmosphere. Everyone visiting should really pay it a visit
4
This is one of the best place for trying Singapore awesome culinary. The location is very close to Raffles Place. It is a large food court, with no air con but it has many big ceiling fans so you don't have to worry about overheat. There is a lot of choices of foods and drinks with reasonable price and you must try chicken satay with peanut sauce and dim sum
4
If you are in Singapore you have to stop at Lau Pa Sat. I tried a variety of Satay located outside the food court and loved it all. Prices were reasonable. Being in a large group caught attention of many businesses and we did get frustrated with people trying to lure us in to try different cuisines. There is a lot of variety here but hard to find an alcoholic drink if you don't feel like beer. There is a seven eleven very close by where you can purchase alcohol (pretty expensive) if you want to sit down and have a few drinks. I highly recommend this food market as I visited numerous times during my stay
5
If you ever visit the Raffles Place, please visit Lau Pa Sat. Its only a short walking distance from the Raffle Place MRT station.We just arrived at Singapore and looking for a late lunch. I was thinking of taking a bus, but a nice local told me how to get there by foot (honestly, the bus system is difficult to understand for me).There are a lot of varieties of food with sort of affordable prices. I went there with two of my friends. We bought Char Kway Teow ($4), Roasted Pork Noodle ($5), and some Special Noodle set ($5.8). The portion is rather big for us but it tastes delicious! We saw some sandwiches sold for $4-$8, so I think we had a good deal.I really wanted to try the Kaya Toast! Its only around $2 complete with coffee. Unfortunately, it was lunch time and I don't think Kaya Toast will be enough for me. Another thing I want to try is the Chili Crab, the price depends on seasonal price
5
This is basically a giant local food court - but the food is cheap and tasty. Find yourself a table, put down a business card in your seat to reserve it (it does work - and don't sit in a seat with a card already there), and then head out and find what you want. They have all sorts of everything there. The only think that can get expensive is dim sum, but I had vietnamese chicken rice of SG$6. Drinks are sold separately
4
The variety of foods available at this place is mind boggling. The prices are reasonable. You do not have to wait a long time for the food. But you will have a tough time finding a place to sit down with your entire party. It is very busy. We had some Indian, Indonesian, Singaporean and Chinese stuff. Reasonably clean surroundings
3
Lau Pa Sat is one of the popular tourist area but it has gotten a little overpriced recently. In addition, satay stores and stalls now tends to target tourist to over order. My advise: be extra specific and precise when making an order. Tell them exactly what you want as they like to throw extra things here and there causing the bill to explode
3
It's a lovely building. Food quality is so so, value can be quite bad. Satay stalls are very overrated. Try almost any other suburban food court to see the difference. Singapore certainly has better food than here.
4
Great choises of food in this modern food court under an old roof. All different Asian cuisines are represented but also some western takes on food. Really loved the naan set, very good taste and spicy in just the right way.
5
...in one place. Really good price and great quality "fast food" restaurants in the centre of financial district, really nice and clean and very good value. We had indian food, really good.
4
Best chicken rice in Singapore! Could Eat there almost every freaking day! Proud to be a Singaporean!
3
It's nice place, so many food variety from asian until western cuisine. The price is good but the taste is so so but not bad. If you looking for the taste, try other places.
5
Super clean and they have wifi. A lot of choices too, there are different cuisines being offered and the range of prices are affordable.
5
A wide range of cuisines are provided in this big food market - Singaporean, Thai, Indonesian, Indian, Chinese, Hainanese...you name it! A great variety of drinks are also available. Grilled satay sticks on the charcoal stove served in the street stall is a MUST TRY!
4
Asian food galore....from pretty much all countries, to suit all tastes. Informal dining area, under cover in a former railway station, so a bit quirky and certainly not pretentious in any way.....just good street food for very reasonable prices. Good atmosphere makes this an enjoyable evening
5
Had Lai Heng chai tow kway, the black version. Coffee black at $1.20.Both were ok edible and drinkable at 3.5 stars. Its a nice place from 1500 out, after the maddenning lunch time crowd.Choice of seats under them humongous fans to while maybe an hour away is nice! Nice intro to tourists to our street food culture in a nice setting
4
We have often travelled on the metro to Newton Circus but our hotel recommended we could walk to Lau Pa Sat. It is quite near the river and financial district, also Chinatown; an easy walk for us.The building, or perhaps roof is a better term, is quaint. A wide range of local food is available and, from our sampling of satay, stingray, char kwai teow, fried rice and lime juice, all pretty good. Affordable, but perhaps not the cheapest anywhere in town
4
Good variety of food choices. Slightly expensive than same type of food else where. Ambience is ok.new look.kind of lose the old touch. but still a famous spot for food.
5
A "must do" in Singapore. Street food all in one large area with most tastes catered for at great prices.
You have missed out on an experience if you don't pay Lau Pa Sat a visit.
4
If you are short of time and want to try local Singapore foods after 6pm then come to Lau Pa Sat. There are a lot of local street foods stalls in this place.
5
Satay 6 is the best satay there. Great place and always fun watching the satay being cooked. Can't go wrong here!
4
In Singapore on business and decided I wanted to try some traditional food. I was advised to check out the Lau Pa Sat. Excellent 'made for you' fast food the Singapore way. Lots of small traders with their own twist on various soups and skewered platter, and of course noodles! Had a chicken dish which came with a miso soup side for $4 SG. Be weary of the many people trying to take your order and get you to sit at their tables. Be firm and they will, politely move on
5
If you are a foodie, a fan of asian street food and asian home style cookes food you will find this place a food haven! Moat asian cuisines are served here, bbqs - pork, chicken, beef and prawns, tom yum and nasi lemak, make sure you have empty tummies coming here. A must if you are in Singapore. I love this place! Note if youre not from here: carry your own tissues/wipes. Food centres in Singapore dont offer these. There will be a couple of individuals who will go around and sell you individually packed tissues and wipes for $2.
4
Singapore is known for its hawker centers, and Lau Pa Sat takes this concept several notches higher.Key words include affordable prices, super wide variety of cuisines, good quality and quick service. I haven't come across a center that offers as many cuisines as LPS - Singaporean, Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Indonesian, Malay, Vietnamese, Korean, Italian, Indian, Turkish, etc. They have all of the major cuisines and much more. Satays are even offered in many varieties at night, when one street is closed to traffic and transformed into Satay Street - al fresco dining concept. You couldn't ask for anything else at Lau Pa Sat. A few stalls, though, need to be educated on the true meaning of service. Their staff need training on hospitality, courtesy and the value of a simple smile. Perhaps too many customers and too little hands in the kitchen ?These shouldn't deter you from going to Lau Pa Sat though, as its biggest draw is the food selection itself. Diverse and inexpensive. I've been to LPS almost 10 times, and will keep coming back to try other dishes.
4
We first didn't know what a "Hawker Centre" is and decided to go to Lau Pa Sat for a first try. The restored steel hall construction caters for a fantastic atmosphere and gives the place a very unique setting (totally different to other food markets we visited). Though the place could be pimped with a broader variety of vegetarian and vegan dishes we found something to eat. Prices are fair. No air conditioning only fans
5
Always come here when in Singapore, it's a "must do" when visiting. Such a hive of activity at dinner time with the many food stalls to choose from but i usually always go and sit outside, get a beer and a plateful of Satays. A great atmosphere with all the sights and smells of satays cooking over hot coals, cant wait go back again
5
If you are not sure what you want to have for lunch or dinner, then head off to Lau Pa Sat. You will find Chinese, Indian, Thai and all manner of foods under one room. There are numerous restaurants offering various kinds of foods and one common sitting area. Not ideal if you want to have a quiet dinner date. But ideal for the free-living spirit who wants to mingle with people from all walks of life.
5
Great food market, with all sorts of hawker shops.
Plenty of choices from many different cuisines.
Fun place to have a beer too.
Beware, the place is not air conditioned, it can get quite hot despite the fans.
4
Located in the heart of CBD. a must visit place especially for dinner. more seats and more option. lunch period for those working around there so avoid going for lunch there. Must try: satay, seafood.
4
I love this place!
It has food from all over Asia which just makes me happy from head to stomach, but it's also in a lovely building!
The one down-side is that it's quite warm in there, so be sure to sit by a fan!
3
Nice street food in the center of Singapore. I tasted chicken and shrimps. shrimps was excellent but the chicken it was not good. Generally it is over moderate.
5
This is a must do. This street market only opens on Weekends. The whole street is a bunch of Satay vendors. Its is super cool and has amazing food at reasonable prices. Higly recommend.
4
Lau Pa Sat is full of hawker food of all kinds!I lived in Singapore for years and I still visit Lau Pa Sat every time I go to Singapore, to get my fix of Singaporean food.It's a relaxed atmosphere. It's outdoors so be prepared for the heat and humidity! And bring your own tissues to save your table spot as well as wiping your fingers (as they don't provide serviettes).My favourite foods are: satays, spicy sting ray, baby kailan, Hokkien mee (noodles), otah otah, Yong Tau fu, chicken rice of course. They also have a great selection of other foods: vegetarian, Indian, Turkish, Japanese, and others.Enjoy
5
this street food market is located right in the heart of CBD. thy variety of dishes served ar large and awesome.the service is extremely quick. you will be able to enjoy a tasty meal and still make it for your meetings with ample of time to spare. if you are in singapore, this is the place to stuff yourself.unagi in pepper sauce is the best thing to eat her
4
This is a must- try venue for a satay experience in Singapore. Lots of reasonably priced stalls cooking in the street area and can also eat inside . Great at night when the open cooking flames and aroma light up the place. Delicious satay and noodle dishes.
5
This is a must-see/experience for a visitor, even if you are not a fan of street food. There are about 50 vendors serving all kinds of Asian dishes in a $4-5 range, and there is definitely something for everyone!As a bonus, one of the side streets next to it also becomes a satay heaven after 7pm every night (go to stalls #7 & 8)
4
Every time I come to Singapore, I will visit Lau Pa Sat! It has great local Singaporean food at decent price! My favorite food there are the satay (there are many stands outside of the food court, on the street! To me they all taste similar, just choose one that you think is good is fine). Hokkien mee, Chinese BBQ pork noodle are also good as well!The place is fairly clean considering it is a hawker center, but of course as it is not an indoor restaurant (i.e., no AC) it can be hot and humid while eating. Remember to bring some napkin with you, as I don't recall they provide any at each food stand 
5
An amazing collection of authentic and amazing street food from across Asia... A must when in Singapore !!!
5
nice satay cheap food nice environment poor toilets very near my hotel tourist spot but quiet during weekends nice to see during night time very near top places in singapore
5
it was a fun trip to this food court. The visitors from US and Uk were happy to taste a wide variety of cuisines and the ice kacang and cendol and ice delights and the various fruits were really fascinating . The ambience was very casual and the life of the place was palpabl
4
If you visit Lau Pa Sat, you will leave hungry. Carrying on an old school tradition of Singaporean street food, here you can enjoy very authentic - and very inexpensive - covering many asian cuisines - Vietnamese, Singaporean, Indian, Chinese... all delicious. Recommend sitting outside near the satay grills with a pitcher of Tiger beer
3
Love the building and the whole atmosphere. We found the food to be a little over-priced but its probably due to the location.Satay area was really interesting but we were slightly annoyed at the hawkers who kept persisting to sit us at a table and to order from them
4
For Satay lovers or those wanting to try nice good satay with local pricing. try the stalls from 7 & 8 . after 1 try I felt in love with it and have never change to any stall since. Do try out their BBQ prawns as well. goes perfectly with Beer (*sorry to the Muslims friends) Warning: those with Nuts allergy do give it a miss or try taking it without the sauce. the stall serves extra nutty sauce to go with their satay. which is just heavenly.Wonder when is my next satay craving. this review is making me hungry again
3
The best time to come here is the evening, coz the satay stalls only open at night, and the weather is more permissiveMy first impression was crowded, instantly we feel annoyed when surrounded by the hawkers who disturbed us by swinging with their menus on our faces, also can't decided where to sit, because it seems each hawker have their own special arranged table. At last we decide to eat satay, as their famous speciality here, we order from stall 7&8, the food is good and came so fast. Other than the unique eating location where we can eat on the middle of the road and surrounding by the tall building, and their famous satay, the rest is nothing better than the rest local food court in Singapor
4
Lau Pa Sat was the location for good local street food in Singapore and people from all walks of life would flock there during weekends to engage in Singaporeans favourite past time of eating. Now newly renovated it still retains the basic structure of the past installed with modern amenities
2
Went there because of satay. The satay was a total disappointment. It was tough. And the price was a tad higher than elsewhere.There were also cooked food stores near the seating area for satay. And they were not good either.They closed off the road after 7 pm to allow the stalls to set up tables for diners there
5
This hawkers market has got you covered. So many choices that it gets hard to decide what and where to eat. The food is fresh, flavorful and cheap. In the evening the satay vendors take over the side street and approximately ten different satay shops open up. The hawkers come to your table and offer their menus to you. The deliver your selections and then you pay them. Cash only trade here. Watch out for the man selling tissues, as the hawkers don't have napkins. There is a place to wash your hand out the back near the bathrooms which is very handy. A must to visit in Singapore.
5
I really like the taste of the satay from this stall. Very reasonable price. They have chicken, mutton and prawn satay. The staff are all very pleasant and friendly. Come and try the street food from the busy business district of Singapore.
4
We went there at 11:30am & the lunch crowd started to trickle in a little before noon.
You have so much variety to select from. Just imagine a Mall FoodCourt but without air conditioning
5
everything is available at affordable rates. shuts at 10pm. lunchtime gets crowded wont get place to sit
5
The perfect place to get some satay also at a late hour. The stall number 8 is outside grilling them on the BBQ, giving lots of smoke, and they taste great. Price wise it is a bit expensive for a food court, 30 satays for 42 dollars, and for me it seems that the food court at Newton is cheaper and better for the seafood
5
There are many great restaurants in Singapore but if you want to go somewhere with a ton of different choices, then visit Lau Pa Sat. It is right downtown and is in the style of a food court with numerous small food stalls. Although the choices are primarily Asian and Indian, they come is a wide variety of styles. There are also a smattering of western stalls as well. We tried food from four different stalls and they were all tasty and very reasonably priced, and far cheaper than the typical tourist restaurants.
4
La Pau Sat is the best Hawker in Singapore. It is a little bit of culture in the heart of the city. Inside the main building you can get a huge range of foods and they are always busy, so you know they are good. Personally, I am a lover of the Satay. I have been there a number of times and this dish is the one I go for. Outside you have the BBQ section with all the Satay stalls. I like the way down the far right corner, the chicken and beef is slightly more cooked. You must try all- Chicken, beef and prawns. It is a really nice vibe and great food. They only thing that is a little annoying is people are hustling to buy stuff (tissues) the whole time
4
I saw the 20 skewers of Satay to be too little so I got the next level for another 8 USD (total of 30 USD). The taste is more than amazing. You get 20 of Beef, Chicken, and Duck. The only downside is there are bits of fat in the skewers which adds a ton of flavor but If you are health conscious, you should take it of
5
Used to be an "Old Market", and now is a famous Local Food Court.it's located in between high-rise financial-hub building, due to their historical and unique it's became famous. it's for local office man/ladies to caught up a quick lunch and place to gather friends after work. Their famous food is the satay (like bbq meat), hot spicy grill seafood and with Sugar Cane Juice drink. High-rise Building view of coz~ it's noisy and clouded as expected. Price is slightly higher than a normal food court. if you visit after 7pm, the street is close to traffic and served as dining area. so imagine that you just sit at the center of road with high-rise building view, yummy local food and charming old-bell ring hourly

The experience of walking into this enormous space with a wide array of food stalls was interesting. The central area has beverages for sale and each counter displays a different kind such as hot beverages, cold beverages (non alcoholic), beer, desserts and fresh fruit juices. Above the beverage stalls is a space used for performances by bands. The building which was a church that has been converted into this iconic foodie paradise has tables and chairs that seemed to be constantly full. At night the place is beautifully lit up with color changes. What's more is that the satay served in the stalls on the outside of the building are a must.....available from 7 pm. So get there with enough time to spare so that you can check out the food options before settling on your choice. It's easily accessible on the green line (north east line). Check it out

Perfect place to have your satays, with the office skyscrapers in the backdrop as night falls and the mixture of burnt smell n cool wind breezes cross your face. Colleagues and I bought dishes to share. We had 50 satays for S$38. Typically satays can cost $0.80 per stick. Variety of chicken, beef, mutton available.Lookout for over-friendly staff who assists you to your seat n be prepared to purchase food and drinks with them. At times, tissues sellers peddles wet or dry tissues for $1
4
Great food but beware the stallholders on the road are ruthless and persistent..we ended up with far too many options and wasted food.Must do experience all the same
5
Best place to go to eat different Asian food in a very affordable price... If you are a food lover or simple on a budget this is the place you want to be on your first day in Singapore...
4
Great place to eat with family and friends. Many satay stalls to choose from. Delicious mixed sticks and plenty of sauce. Enjoyed with cold Tiger, garlic fried rice and greens. We also took along a bottle of wine.
4
Very reasonable priced prawns and mixed meat dishes with a sensational satay sauce.
A couple of jugs of Tiger beer too.
Worth an evening visit.
4
This is one hawker centre that must be visited....very upend and stylish and clean and huge choices......and most of all....so many vegetarian stalls....from chinese to south indian to north indian to gujarati.....was impressed by the size too...!
4
Great food outlet for authentic street cooking . Must try the satay BBQ. Opens till late . Best place to drink on the cheap after midnight .jug of local draft beer is 18 -20 sing dollars
5
1st time in Singapore, we thought "we can go to a standard restaurant everywhere, let's try here something more authentic". The result? UAU! Fantastic. The atmosphere is authentic, you pick up what you want from different stands, and you bring your stuff at your table. Feeling thirsty? Magic... a nice lady appears and asks you if you want a cold beer. You find whatever you would dream of in asiatic/indian style. There are stands inside the "market" and other outside the market. We have LOVED the satay-sticks outside the market (see picture) and the bao/dim sum (dumplings) stand inside. A must do in Singapore (better than Chinatown Street food market)
3
I was recommended to visit this place after 7pm to have dinner. And amazingly after 7pm the street was closed and they make way for food peddler to set up their business there. I was spoilt for choices as most of the stall sell the same food menu. I spent closed to $40 and it was a good experience. The taste of the food was average. The fried noodles kind of salty to me and the cockles was not properly cooked. Satay was fantastic! Should try them whenever you visit Lau Pa Sat
4
Located in the center of business area, it's one of many hawker center that's a must visit for food lover. It's huge with lots of options of food, and it's open 24hr. We went there twice. First at midnite, the second one at lunch time. We could find many stalls open even at midnite. Food was great and with a reasonable price as well
4
Good Asian food from around the world and many variety of choice...but a bit expensive for local and international visit.. So if you looking for bargain don't go here just go to local shop... They are more cheaper then this place.. Beside the price the place was great ..
5
Good place to have your all day dining experience. breakfast lunch or dinner, you name it. Price is reasonable consider its place in the business area. Tried the char kwee tiau or satay, didn't disappointed.
2
Kway Chap was overpriced and very salty. Ordered intestines, egg, fishcake and pig's skin with a bowl of kway(rice noodles) for 1 person, this 4 ingredients cost a whopping $7.20.
Taste and quality disappointing.
Do not recommend.
5
I think the food are affordable and tasty. Went there with some friends and we tried brani, oyster omelette, and kwetiau and they are all good and we got it for 5sgd each. Will definitely come again
4
We stayed in a hotel near the area and went to Lau Pa Sat on a Sunday morning for breakfast. There were quite a few stalls that opened. We chose the dim sum stall and a Laksa stall. It was not crowded in the morning, although by 11am when all the stalls are opened, we expect the area to be full of people
4
That food court has its uniqueness from the building, a renovated market place that finds its origin in the 19th century. Like all other food courts, a variety of cuisine can be found, and it is mostly the atmosphere and the opened air that can be enjoyed ther
5
This place is near my office and was my favourite place for lunch/ dinner until I have been to other hawker store. I found the foods (other than satay) are not as good as other hawker store. For instance the oyster omelette they sell there is full of flour but no eggs or oyster. And same goes for other dishes. But if you have been out for a drink at night and need some foods, do visit for the satay at night and beers Best place for mid night snack
5
We never miss the opportunity to have dinner at lau pa sat every time we visit singapore. This hawker center offers a wide range of food and cuisine and is famous for its satays. A visit here is a must and this is accessible by taxi as well as mrt which is a few minutes walks from across. A wide range of food including Indian, Japanese, Vietnamese as well as many types of barbecued meat is available. If you do not eat pork you must make sure to ask the vendors as many include pork in their dishes. The food here can be expensive especially if you buy sea food such as chilli crabs, lobster etc...but is well work the money spent. A satay( chicken , beef or pork) is priced at 70 cents with a minimum order but a prawn satay is about sing $2 per stick with a minimum order of 5. Best is to order a few different dishes and some steamed rice and a vegetable and share
4
Went straight to 7/8 satay. The guy found us a table even though it was very busy. The satay came very quick and freshly cooked. There are a wide variety of food to choose from as well as ice creams and other deserts. Had to spend two dollars on a tiny packet of wet wipes. Worth a visit for a traditional singapore dish with so many to choose from
4
This is a a nice and also bit touristy place to visit. If you like Satay, BBQ seafood, Beer and Tea Tarik this a a must go place. Great food and great vibe. As for the food inside the Food center i find it average better food at the shopping malls
5
My friends and I had one night in Singapore and we decided to check out this downtown hawker center for lunch. Overall this was a pretty good experience. Out of all of the other hawker centers I have been to this one was definitely the biggest and busiest as we went around noon on a weekday. The tables were pretty clean for the amount of people there.What I was really impressed by was the vast selection of foods. There was local, Japanese, Turkish, Korean, Chinese, western, Indian, Malaysian, Indonesian, Vietnamese among many others. We decided to split several dishes including a Turkish lamb/chicken kebab, a plate of spicy Asian noodles, and carrot cake. The kebab was honestly one of the best kebabs I have ever had in my life. If I am ever in downtown Singapore again I'd definitely check this place out again
4
Nice place, much better than many other food centers of Singapore.
Centrally located in an elegant area.
Great variety of Asian and local food.
Good prices, not higher than the other food centers.
I can say is my favourite food center
5
Lau pa sat has one of the most varieties as a hawker centre in Singapore. You can find Thai, Indian, Turkish, Chinese at a very reasonable price
1
We took friends who had not eaten much Asian foods to the Hawker centre n was most disappointed by the level of the meal . We ordered Satay chicken n beef ' sting ray wings 'prawns in salted egg yolk ' crispy baby squid 'Sambal Kang Kong and fried rice . The dishes were small 'tasteless 'and to make things worse it was overpriced. We know this as the day before we went to Newton hawker centre n had a bigger meal and the price was reasonable. And the stall that is in the middle selling fruit n juices they need to teach the person talking the other should learn to be a bit more friendly I don't want him to be my bff but just not so grumpy . I also work with the public I know it can get tiring but u grin n bear it
4
I live in Singapore for 2 years now and I just live 20 metres far from Lao Pa Sat. Since I'm Italian and I'm quite picky I don't go there often because the food is a bit heavy and oily but I have to say quality is nice and the meals are tasty . Moreover you can find 20 or more different type of food . Buon Appetito 
3
Lots of choices, and you want to try them all! Can't remember the names of the eateries, shrimp noodle, satay were tasty. The satay shop waiter offered me a mini portion, and I got 8 skewers (usually it comes in 20 or more skewers, and can choose from chicken, beef and lamb) to sample this famous dish from Lau Pa Sat
4
Great selection of stalls serving all kinds of food, for the more nervous travelers - the stalls by/on Satay street offer table service - the food isn't as good but for bigger groups and those with kids it might be easier. On satay street - the stall with the red tshirts is definitely the best and all offer sticky rice cubes on the sid
3
I've been to Singapore a number of times and I come to LPS for satay every time. But I found it's starting to lose it charm in recent years. It's still a great outdoor dining experience for tourists. Not many places you can sit in the middle of the street and having beer and bbq. But have moderate expectation and enjoy the night. Satay street opens from 7pm every night. Don't come too early if you're there for satay
4
I only tried two food outlets here, one serving Satay food, and one Thai. The Thai was really great (green curry chicken soup). Satay was also good, but to a lesser extent. Some friends tried a Japanese outlet and liked it as well. Great variety, quick service, good prices, and from what I tried, good quality. Bear mugs for 5.50$, a bargain in Singapore
2
If it comes to selection of foods, this local food festival offers a wide range of cookings, from Costa-rican to sea foods, from India to Indonesia, and in a cheap price.However when it comes to taste, it may be disappointing. I tried the sea food, it was not extraordinary, even not well done. The Indian dishes is a bit better. The Chinese dishes are bit overwhelming
4
There are so many styles of food being served from the individual kiosk's inside a beautiful old building. Some food is cooked as you wait, others are already cooked and just served when ordered but all is fresh and cheap. It is very lively and noisy, has inside and outside seating and is one of the best hawker centres. Beer is also available. Nearby is Satay Street - also worth visitin
5
Try the satay. Don't miss it. Moreover, so many food choices. From japanese, to chinese, korean, indian, thai and other cuisine. Normally, the food servings are good for two people so don't hesitate to buy for the price.
5
Best hawker market in Singapore. Food from all over the globe. I could eat there once a fortnight without it being repetitious. Satay stalls are set up on one of the surrounding streets. Short walk from multiple MRTs.
5
You can find any kind of food do you want here! It's cheaper.
And the building is sooo georgeus!
U must visit this foodcourt!
4
Sample a bit of everything here. The building is very pretty and you can get all the usual wonderful Singaporean fare.
5
There are so many hawker centres in Singapore, but this one was my favourite. It had a great selection of cuisines and plenty of options within them. The food is typically reasonably priced and all very good quality. The centre itself is also quite striking as a building, so take in the surroundings while you are there.Also go out to Satay Street or the back of the centre. It is a street which they close from 7pm and let the satay vendors operate seating. The selecting of vendors, and ordering food and drink can be a bit manic, and the whole street can be chaotic at times, but the atmosphere is still kind of fun. Ultimately the most important part is that the food tastes great and again, there is quite a range of options of satay
5
Daily, at sharp 7:00pm the traffic policemen jump onto Boon Tat Street (at the Lau Pa Sat Hawker Center) in the middle of the business district, in order to close down the street. The last car has not yet passed the traffic light, when buzzing people push plastic tables and chairs onto the street. Cook shops are dragged onto the sidewalks and charcoal grills are inflamed. Only a few minutes later, you can enjoy Singaporeâ€™s best satay.The Hawker Center itself is one of the best preserved centers in town. The Victorian architecture shows elaborate cast-iron pillars, which were once imported from Glasgow. You can even find an old clock tower
4
Love Lau Pa Sat Food Markets - especially sitting out on the street and eating the best Satays.There are other food varieties available, such as Crab, Japanese, Indian etc. but the Satays are fantastic, especially if accompanied by a cold Tiger Beer.The streets surrounding the Hawker Centre are closed off from approx 7.00pm and it is a great atmosphere. Don't miss it on your next visit to Singapor
2
This "hawker center" is conveniently located for tourists who wants to enjoy rooftop bar in the city afterward and the choices are multiples. I have also worked nearby and ate there multiples with my colleagues but I don't remember being satisfied by any dishes i ordered. No stall is good and all the dishes are over priced compared to other real hawker cente
5
Also known as Telok Ayer, this is a great destination in itself for the fine cast-iron structure. As well, it's the most convenient hawker centre right in the middle of Singapore - easy to walk to. There is a great selection of Malay and Chinese food of all kinds, and helpful attendants wandering around happy to sell you a beer or get you satay sticks, noodles, dumplings, seafood or anything - or choose your own by wandering around the stalls. Plenty of places to sit down and eat your discoveries. It's not haute cuisine but it's clean, it's pleasant, it's cheap, it's relaxed and it's very authentic and lots of fun to visit and dine
5
This hawker center is different from others. This one is big, clean, and spacy. Lot of food stalls. Variety of foods from different country.We want to try everything but limited to my stomach. So we tried Char Kway Teow and wonton noodle. It taste delicious and not expensive like those food court in shopping mall. After eating, we walked to the back and there are satay stalls line up at the side of the road. Smells delicious and tempting but too bad we are so full. so we will come back next time for those satay
4
Lots of choice, maybe a little too much. Very cheap food inside the hall. Clean and busy after work hours. Easy access on the SMRT. Beer and juice also available.
5
I can't love this place enough! Full of culture and a huge range of different foods. Vegetarian curries, delicious noodles, delectable rice dishes! A must do while in Singapore!
The desserts are awesome and super cheap!
5
This food court has something for everyone! There is literally every type of food you can imagine and everything is delicious! Another pro is that the air circulation through here is amazing! Even on a really hot day it will be nice to sit and enjoy a meal or snack.
4
This place has many small food outlets serving you variety of Asian cuisineThey also have a satay (meat on skewers,grilled with special sauce) marketThe food is cheap but clean and tasty. Select from any of the outlets and enjoy the food sitting in the common area.It's crowded at lunch time but you will enjoy it for a quick and variety mea
4
We went for lunch here and found there is every option you could imagine with food from all over the world. We had some duck noodles which were good but i suspect there are better options if you are in the know. It seemed there were a lot of people eating Indian food which looked really good. Take your time to look around at the stalls and what people are eating before making a choice. Make sure you are carrying cash to pay
5
One place where you will find multiple cuisine. American fast-food, Chinese, Indian, Italian and more. The only issue is it's almost impossible to find a place during peak lunch hours as corporates from across frequent this place. I personally loved one of the Indian food joints over there - very homely south Indian non vegetarian food. If you went there blind folded it's hard to say it's "hotel" food. And it's cost 5/6 SGD! Komalas was good for a hot evening samosa and masala tea. Also loved the shop that has fresh cut fruits
4
There are many stalls to choose but like only 4 types of food: fish ball, indian, chicken rice and wok. If you looking for halal food, there was only a few choices.Personally, I prefer food court like seah Im in front of harbour front. More choices and cheaper :)
3
A place for us to reminisce about the old time hawker foods of Singapore. Was disappointed as we sampled favourites from Satay, Wantan Mee, Char Kway Teow, Chicken Rice and Iced Desserts; it simply does not taste the same as it used to be and no longer value for money. May be a great place for foreign tourists to sample a variety of local fare at one location, but talking to elderly returning locals, it just does not satisfy anymore
3
Visited this venue for dinner tonight. It was so well organised and clean. Lots of tables and chairs and not a problem to find a seat. I don't think I have ever seen so many nationalities of food. Unfortunately we chose an Indian place and it was quite mediocre. After we ate our food and couldn't wait to leave, we noticed many more Indian stalls which looked like they were better than the one we chose. I would suggest you walk around and check out all the stalls before placing your order. We were too quick to chose and made a mistake. I would go back as I liked the fact that it was clean and there were so many choices. As we were leaving we passed the satay stalls and there was an outside sitting section near these. This was where the atmosphere was and I would go back and sit there next time. The satay looked lovely
5
Lau Pa Sat was just only few minutes from my accommodation so even I was visiting lot of different hawker centers, I visited LPS few times. I was really enjoying food there: laksa, black carrot cake (delicious), thundertea rice (ok), mix of Indian food (love it)... Place clean, refurbished not long time ago. During evening time small street around are closed and You can see barbecues and eat satay. I love it every time when I was there
4
If you enjoy eating seafood this is the best place to eat Chilli Crabs. Cooked fresh as you order, fast and friendly staff.
5
My favorite eating place in a long time. Excellent to sample so much Asian food from all over. Cheap. Great outdoor satay.
5
Great selection of local delights, and on every evening, one side of the street will be closed for placing tables and chairs. And various of fantastic satay can be ordered.
5
Best hawker food in Singapore. Great atmosphere. Either walk around and choose from the many food stalls or take a seat and wait to be offered food from s menu. One of the specialities of the market are the satays, choose from chicken, mutton and even prawn. Most of all it's delicious.
5
When you miss chicken and mutton in Singapore, you must definitely head to Lau Pa Sat (a.k.a.) Telok Ayer Market. This is the place for best Malaysian satays.If you are looking for satays, then you should seat in the outdoor area known as "satay street". Beware of competition between local hawkers. We've tried satays from the one with number 10 and really enjoyed them
3
This is just a glorified food court. Can get uncomfortable on a hot day. A street along Lau Pa Sat is closed at 7 pm for dinning on the streets, where there are many stalls selling satay. Satay is meat on skewers and then BBQ. It is expensive. You can get tastier satay at lower prices at other places. I would not recommend specially taking a trip there
5
Despite the location which might suggest a place full of turists and therefore providing low quality food, this food court is instead the best place to go to for a tasty and informal dinner. The variaty of food is unbelivable, you can really find whatever you like here for an extremely cheap price. Outside bbq is also served (both fish and meat).Absolutly a must in Singapore
4
If you are a foodie and would like to try out local food then Lau Pat Sat food court is a not miss place. This is like a large food court with over 50 stalls selling various kinds of local food (Singaporean, Chinese, Malay, Thai, Indonesian and Indian), and you also have some western options as well. This is the real fast food, but it is fresh fast food and most stores cook it fresh for each person (esp the soups, porridges, dim-sum). Best time to visit is at night and you might find it tough to find a spot at times. The special here is Satay with so many satay stalls.The food is authentic as it can get, fresh, hot and tasty. You have a lot of options to choose from. If you want to know the more popular joints in there just look at the crowd in front of each store. The pricing is so reasonable, you can have 3 satisfying meals a day for well under 10 USD. Dont miss the Satay, Dim-sum and the Conjee her
5
You have to try the Satay Nights when they close of the street and set up their open air dining, love it like us or hate it you have to experience the local flavour and mix with locals, tourists and expats. Everybody loves the value for money experience. We have now eaten there at leas 6 times and will go back
4
A whole range of food choices from local to international. Personally I go there for the BBQ seafood and satay not the rest. To me, the prices are slightly overrated on the rest of the food selection. Satay is sold on the adjacent street. The whole street of choices. They are about the same actually. Not much difference
5
A huge variety of food at this market which is open late. The Satay sticks are delicious and so is the chicken rice. All the food was great and so cheap. A must see when in Singapore.
5
So much choice of food and a great busy local atmosphere. The chicken, beef and prawn satay sticks are a must to try cooked fresh over a BBQ!
4
Really like this place, always find ourselves at Satay numbers 6 or 7. Quick food and lots of it. Good value for money and for some reason we always bump into someone we know from home. Chicken, mutton and prawn combo best.
4
Took the subway here as heard this was a place to try . So much to choose from its quite difficult. Decided to try Singapore noodles, and they were very tasty, with 3 vegetables and chicken , once you've got your meal you just have to find a table . Our other choice was an Indian meal which also was tasty . Full of families enjoying the ambiance of this place
4
Lau Pa Sat has a wide selections of local hawker food such as chicken rice, pork noodles, duck rice, dim sum, etc. There are many stalls here but not all the food served are delicious. There is a row of vendors selling satay in the evening. One of the side street in front of the satay vendors will be closed after 7pm and converted to outdoor street dining area
3
This place used to be good before the latest renovation... Food was nicer and cheaper. Since the re-opening only few stall really stands over other but nothing different from any other Food Court. It's just more comfortable to eat there now as it's no longer as hot as it used to be and the night time satay side food is still good.Should try at least one time but no need to try all the stalls
4
This busy Food Hawker is opposite from SofitelSo Hotel. This place is also known as the most famous Satay Street. There are a lot of Satay Restaurants on the street. We had such a pleasant meal that day. The Satay was very delicious.Can't wait to visit this place again
5
This is the Singapore that I used to love back in the 90's, cheap food, cheap beers, locals mixing with tourists, a variety of foods from the globe, the smell of satay wafting in the air. It makes a perfect change from the sterile mega mall food courts that have replaced the hawker type food centers from years ago. This is worth its weight in gold as a venue for me & if I get back to Singapore, it is a must
4
Located at a prime location of Raffels quay and Robinson Road, this place house amazing variety of cuisines. It is an upmarket food court with all kind of Asian cuisines. A must if are around that area for the variety and definitely the price. We had lunch at Shri Ganga. Mysore Masala Dosa, Samosa, Chapati set - all good in taste and cheap
5
This place is full of delicious food cooked right in front of you. I found it quite hard to find stalls that did chicken rice and noodles though but eventually found some. Then I went outside to the satay stalls and ordered a mix of chicken, beef and lamb satay sticks. All of the food was so yummy and only cost $20 all up! I highly recommend this place for tourists as you can sample some of the finest Singapore dishes.
5
It has everything. It's beautiful and clean. Everyone is polite. Staff cleans up after you. Prices are reasonable. it's downtown. Wow. Don't miss it for an endless selection of southeast asian cuisines. You won't know what to do once you're there - so many choices.
5
This is one thing you must do if you want to experience local food delicacies. Amazing ambience and great quality.
4
We visited Lau Pa Sat an "Eat street". Approx 60 inside food vendors in market setting as well as adjoining street which was closed to traffic and tables and chairs erected plus many more food venders. Great at night for variety and cheap eats
1
Very commercial. Quite expensive and very bad food. Lowest value for money. Avoid by all means, especially when you are after authentic Asian cuisine.
5
In the heart of the financial district, surrounded by the tallest buildings in Singapore you will find Lau Pa Sat, one of the most popular food markets in the city. Come here to try the local delicacies, chicken rice, satay and kaya toast, as well as the other dishes that make up the varied cuisine on offer in Singapore. Although there are plenty of places to try these dishes, Lau Pa Sat is the ideal location to find them all under one roof, and the setting is far more romantic than most hawker centres, especially at night when the satay vendors set up stalls outside
3
This is the long standing grilled seafood stall... Once again my friend wants to try the sambal chilli stingray. On a friday night, la pa sat is filled with locals and tourists. The satay stalls had endless queues.. This place is truely a hawker food haven for both local and tourist
5
Great variety of food stalls in one location. We ate here several times and were very happy with every meal. Some were extremely economical. Something that will be please everyone here and there is a divine little patisserie where you can get great cakes and puddings, and I highly recommend the ice cream
5
Lau Pa Sat is the place to go for authentic, fresh satay. The whole huge laneway comes alive at about 4.00pm. There are numerous satay vendors, bbqing their satays in the open air, smoke is everywhere in the air, and the smell is to die for. Tiger beer is plentiful , The atmosphere is fantastic, with hundreds of tables and stools available to sit and eat and take in what's going on around you
4
One would be spoilt for choice on the food front here. Variety of cuisines from different parts of the world at low prices makes it a great place to have your meal!May get crowded during lunch time, as the place is accessible from a good number of offices nearby
3
It is located near Downtown MRT and I strongly recommend tourists to not get there during lunch time since it'll be crowded and everything will get a little overwhelming. There are tons of food options there (Indian, Chinese, Turkish, Japanese, etc) so everyone could taste as much cuisines as possible! Definitely will visit there again but at night
3
The Dim Sum stall name is called "Bao Luo Wan Xiang Dim Sum", and not just Lau Pa Sat. Because Lau Pa Sat has many stalls. It's exact location is Lau Pa Sat Festival Market #01-94, 18 Raffles Quay, 048582.
Tel: 62209767
5
Such a vast array of options for food. we went for a mix of grilled shrimp, grilled chicken, soups and dumplings all amazing. I really enjoyed how easy it was for each member of our party to order from a different stall and eat all together
5
Went for dinner - love this place.Go to stall Best Satays 7 & 8Their chicken, beef & mostly prawns are the best because they are shelled & a delicious flavour They come over and sell beer by the jug. Get the Roti bread too - that is so good - cheese, garlic & plain.Chinese broccoli also good.Not a cheap night.Plastic tables & chairs.Take your own tissues and wipes - it's messy.
4
My husband is very non adventurous when it comes to food but the recommendation from our driver from the airport convinced him to have a look. We walked from the Fullerton hoping we would remember where exactly it was after having it pointed out to us in the daytime...everything looks different at night!!! Well we had no trouble finding it and there was definitely a buzz from the huge numbers of locals and tourists eating here. Its always a good sign when you see the locals patronising certain places. Well my non adventurous husband got carried away and actually decided that everything looked clean, fresh and inviting so he ordered a chicken noodle dish for $5 which was more than enough for the both of us to share. Lovely food! We were disappointed that this was our last night in Singapore as we would have definitely returned!!
5
I have been here so many times just for the Satays! Ive tried out so many stalls and I would highly recommend this place for tourists, friends and relatives. The only thing I find irritating are the tissue vendors that have been a bit pesky but I know they are also trying to make a living so sometimes I would buy yet other times I would just be polite and say no. Overall I have a great experience at this place like always
4
So, a trip to Singapore would not be complete without a stop at Lau Pa Sat! We trekked over to this location from Gardens by the Bay just one train stop away. We went after 7 PM as they close the street behind the market and set up lots of tables for everyone to sit and eat. As you walk through the location, you will find all kinds of food (Korean, Chinese, Indian, etc). We eventually stopped and ate at stalls 7 and 8. We ordered 10 beef aticks, 10 chicken sticks, and 6 shrimp sticks for approximately $20. They all tasted very good. One item to note is that napkins are almost non-existant. They have some locals selling napkins and wet-naps to clean your hands. You can clearly tell who has and hasn't been there before as they bring napkins :) Great experience in my opinion. Would definitely return
4
A good place for centralised local food, catered specially for tourists. Might be slightly pricey, but still reasonable. Touting by respective food stall owners is NOT allowed, so do not be obliged to buy from any stall, esp if they are aggressive in touting. Can be rather hot and humid so do dress casually for those who do not like hot and humid eating places. (non-airconditioned place!)Easiest way: walk from Raffles Place MRT (Red Line

We had 3 visits to Lau Pa Sat this holiday. Our favorite stall was No.8 Satay. This is family does a brilliant job. We were welcomed in a most friendly way. The Satay was great. I was taking photos of the cook. They invited me to be in the photos. Me and cook cooking the satay. They provided anything we asked for. The hardest part was saying goodbye to these great people on our last visit. Will go to this stall again without hesitation. Thanks Guys

Food tells a lot about culture and that can be witnessed at Lau Pa Sat.A confluence of ethnic diversity can be seen by the Indian food stand, next to Malaysian curry next to Chinese soup noodles.You can try a variety of local delicacies at a fraction of the cost in the confines of a clean and hygienic seating area.Try the sugarcane juice, Indian curries, with hainan chicken rice and satays here

Lau Pa Sat, a slang which means old market is Singapore's prime destination for fast, cheap hawker fare. Located in a busy part of Singapore, one needs to walk here, or hail a cab and get off fast, as it is quite hard to find parking. There's plenty of choices here so my suggestion is walk around, and check out its stalls. It's best to order after you have walked around and taste differ from stall to stall.I had the chance to try Hakka food and the famous satay. Taste is average and I find their prices close to those in the food galleries in Takashimaya and also Ion. The place is hot and humid so best to visit the place wearing lightweight clothing

Great local food selection, reasonable prices, relatively clean and tidy for this type of venue in southeast Asia. At night, the satay vendors setup right outside on the street. Wonderful.
5
What a great venue! We popped in for dinner around 8pm and the place was busy but not heaving. The beef balls special and Thai papaya salad were the best dishes of the 4 or 5 we tried. Well worth a visit.
5
Lau Pat Sat is a must-do for any traveller in Singapore. It offers an incredible variety of foods from all over South East Asia, from local satay specials to Japanese and Indian. Upon recommendation from a local, we had food from stalls 6 & 7, and we fed 8 people with the equivalent of Â£60, tasting a range of satay chicken, beef and prawn skewers. Cannot miss it

Price & QualityThe food was surprisingly cheap! We ordered from a seafood provider opposite to a Korean food stall near one of the entrances and it only cost S$20 for 4 dish of noodles. However, mind that they weren't of large sizes so perhaps males will need to order some sides as well. Nonetheless, it was quite enough to keep me away from hunger:)P.S. I highly recommend to compare prices before ordering the food as I saw some stalls were calling for S$18 for just a bowl of noodles:(ServicesThe services were generally good. They actually brought the dishes you ordered to your table. However, some of them are actually quite annoying that at the beginning when we are circling around to look for foods we would like to try, there was a guy that keep chasing after us. I understand that perhaps he was only trying to get us ordering his food. Still, that was way too over and it made me felt uncomfortable.Environment & Seats availabilityI cannot say it was super clean, but it was acceptable. The good thing is there were a large amount of seats available, however, I do recommend to sit underneath a fan as it was super hot inside.P.S. I found that when you search on Google, "Lau Pa Sat", on the right side, it actually display whether the place is busy. You can cross check with the data before you decide whether to go or not.LocationAnother bad side of it was that it was quite far away from the MRT station. If you are not a fan of walking in hot air, be sure to check out other transportation like bus or taxi:

I came here because the cab driver kept raving about the halal satay. The satay is pricey @ S$0.70 a stick vs S$0.40 elsewhere. Taste is very average and is easily dominated by Samuri Kajang Satay in Malaysia. Even the sauce is too sweet. I went to stall 7/8 which was supposed to be the best. The owner was boasting she goes to Italy once a year! This really is a touristy hawker area and not many lacks around. The satay hawkers (10-15 stalls) try to push sets of 20sticks but you can but just 1 if you want. Don't be cheated. Inside the Lau Pa Sat food court, it's much more comfortable and a lot more quiet.
4
Over last 15 years seems to have become a bit blander and more sanitised but still offers a wide range of hawker food at reasonable prices plus Tiger Beer ladies eager to ply you with jugs of the stuff. Still a good place to go after work for local food and local beer. Pick a stall with at least a small queue and you can't go wrong. Had a good oyster omelette, black and white carrot cake, kang kong etc. Standard hawker fare that Singapore does so well. Choice is enormous, catering to most tastes
4
We went here around 10am on a Saturday. A lot of stalls were still closed so we had to wait until around 11am for some of the stalls to open. There a lot of Asian food choices and some western as well. We had a good meal but do not expect prices to be too cheap. A decent meal would be around SGD $10-12 per person which is a normal meal in Singapore.
5
A good place for breakfast, lunch and dinner, as the price in the city is cheap, location is few mins walk from the nearest MRT, lots of food to choose from, e.g. pizza, rice , noodles and so on, drinks (cold or hot) is not a problem. And is a nice place to get together. And the food is frashly cook when you order.P.S. that using a food-card will be cheape

Lau Pa Sat has been a haunt for most the tourists in Singapore, but as a local I do not strongly recommend the food there do represent Singapore local fav food. May be to us local, we too spoilt for choice when it comes to eating local fav. My recent visit with my family there, I had a surprise finding to see a Brazilian food stall in there. Has some similarity with Mexican but not the spicy fav type like their Cousi

This was a place my wife wanted to go, not really my thing as I am a bit of a germaphobe! I have to say the atmosphere was great, and when you go in the evening, the street is pedestrianised, and all the traders put out tables and stools.Well, it's the typical free for all of sales here, everyone trying to tell you their Satay is good, better and the best. Reality of it is they are all pretty much of a muchness, so you'll enjoy it which ever one you go to.The do try and push set menus, selling 20 Satay sticks minimum etc. Make sure you know that you can buy 1, 2 or 3 at time, as we ended up buying the set menu and it was far too many. The beer is pretty good, again, be careful, they'll try and sell you a pitcher, only ask for a glass if that is all you want, and be prepared to be asked if you want another as soon as your glass reaches half.It's great eat out in the street, amidst all the skyscrapers, and the food hygiene is meant to be good, as they are strictly controlled. If you like street food this is a must
5
Cooked fresh and very reasonable in terms of price. Fun watching them set up for the satay stalls and the tables at 7 pm when the road gets blocked off. Loved the meals we ate there.
4
If the 3 hawker food market centres we visited in Singapore this would be our favourite. Easy to find, great old building loved the wonton noodle soup we had.
4
Very nice place to choices of a reasonable price and tasty asian eats. Satay--Chinese food--Japanese food. Easy to find. Very good meal.
4
Great place to find descent food in downtown for a readable price. A choice and virtually any Asian style you could be looking for.
It's like a giant mall food court with a local flare.
Facilities are clean as well.
4
Great Ambience..many food options and cool place. The best thing is the bell that is rung every 30mins :)
1
Not good at all.The food quality is poor. When it's busy you will struggle to find a seat. The beer IS NOT COLD. Plastic eating utensils add to the cheap and nasty atmosphere and it's not that cheap. Pay a few dollars more and go else where
4
You can find many kind of food here. First look around to make sure what food you really want. But overall,the food look and I think taste yummy too Don't forget to try squid bbq and satay 34. Yummy!! I suggest you order food without rice,so you can try some different kind of foo
5
We had a few days in Singapore and it didn't take long to find what we think is the best 'hawker' type food. No matter how many times we got a taxi there - there was always a chuckle from the driver - 'good eating like a local'. There is a massive array of food to choose from and the street at the rear is just alive after 7pm when 'satay street' kicks in. Chilli crab just great and a fraction of the price of true restaurants and quite frankly better in a lot of cases. Do yourselves a favour eat here like royalty on a paupers pay.....
4
It's like visiting 100 restaurants all in one. The building is the only colonial survival in the glass canyons of the central business district, surrounded by banks and corporates. But the local are friendly - were were guided from the metro by a banker who wouldn't even stay for a beer when we arrived.The building is like a larger version of London's Covent Garden, with food stalls all through - Indian, Chinese, Thai, Malay, Japanese, Italian, duck, fish, noodles of all shapes and sizes, cakes, fruit and plenty more. But the satay stall on the steps on the east side are where the action is. You can mix and match meals among the stalls, and eat at the communal tables.Not all the stalls are great, but the ones we used (for duck, curry and chicken noodle) were fine. And the satay giant prawns were a bit expensive ... but delicious
4
The 1st time I came to Singapore, friend brought me here. Is still the best food court I ever like, although the price is slightly higher. The architecture & the atmosphere that I really enjoy each time I visit. Must try the famous satay here but come after 6pm to stay away from the heat .
5
So much cheaper than the restaurants and so much nicer. Whatever you want you'll find it here. Don't expect a fancy setting, just enjoy the food.
4
It is nice to check out where the locals eat and for me this was the best dim sum I have ever eaten.
I would definitely recommend it.
4
It was our 2nd time to visit here and famous for their wide variety of food. No matter elders, youngster, foreigners or asians can find what they want here in a reasonable price. What's more, free wi-fi is available for you to share the pictures via internet immediately. Last time, we went there after visiting Gardens by the Bay light show ordering 4 dishes and 3 cups of drinks and worth SGD25.00 only.If you think it's too hot inside for no airconditioner is provided. You may go at night to enjoy the dinner instead.
3
Lau Pa Sat is a food center in the Central Business District. It has a diverse array of food choices - from local stuff to Doner Kebabs and burritos. The architecture is much more interesting than the food, although the stalls I've been to haven't been bad, just not impressive. If you're in the area, it's worth a stop. But if you're closer to one of the other famous hawker centers it's probably a better choice just to go there
4
A must visit place to get the real feel of Singapore , the satay stalls in Boon Tan street next door is our first port of call with stalls 7 & 8 being the pick , satay for two will cost around twenty five dollars two tiger beers twenty dollars . You sit on plastic seat in the open air which adds to the atmosphere , just enjoy the food 
4
We tried this food centre, the first time for us, on this visit to Singapore.The building is pure victorian, with cast iron decorations and open sides.It is surrounded by tall office bulidings in the CBD.There are lots of stalls and plenty of choice. The prices are somewhere between Maxwells and Newton centre. Early evening they set up stalls down one side of the buildings, all serving satay only, there is great competition for your $.We took the MRT to Telok Ayer station, turned right and walked over 3 roads and it is on the right.Worth a visit
3
Lau Pa Sat is food court located in Central Business District in Singapore.There are many kind of food stall in here.So you may find food what you want.This place is famous so many tourists come here.But to tell the truth food quality is food court level and no air conditioner, so if you are not stay in near here I don't recommend to come here.Also there are many food court with air conditioner near Lau Pa Sat.Actually we go here once a week or less
4
If you are after satay the stalls 7 & 8 are the best AND MAKE SURE YOU EITHER ORDER STRAIGHT FROM THE STALL OR THE STAFFS WITH RED T-SHIRT WITH 7 & 8 ON IT because there are lots staffs around with the same red t-shirt but no number ion it and they will say the satay is from 7&8 And definitely is not (not nice at all I must say taste and colour of the satay) so just be aware and enjoy this lively place where locals, tourists and ex-pats are there for a bite to eat in the evening
5
I can't come to Singapore and not come here. This place makes me smile. I love to sit on the closed off street and watch the traffic lights still change, the people squash together on plastic tables and chairs, and sweat the night away eating satay sticks and drinking beer, it's lots of fun. I love the little man who walks around selling wet wipes and tissues (make sure you have $2) and watching the guys try to sell their stall to the newcomers. Come hungry.. eat lots... you'll love it
3
Lau Pa Sat for me is more about historical values than what's offered on each stalls. After the latest renovation, this food court is cleaner and more modern. It was a short walk from Marina Bay Sands, even though hidden in between tall buildings. Food are varied, from the standard Kopi-O to vegetarian Indian. I tried Pho and Vietnamese Spring Rolls which are quite tasty.The place was popular at dinner time on weekdays because it's located in the business district, and people would visit the place on their way back to bus/MRT. I came in for dinner, so the weather isn't that hot and humid. There are no AC, but several fans are on. Nevertheless, get a cold/iced drink. It's quite fancy for a food court although the prices are still reasonable. Just don't compare them to the ones you find under HDB or nearby market
5
Is not expensive and the food is all good. What ever you want to eat is pretty much here. Worth visiting.
3
The charming 19th century structure was revamped in 2014 and is a must when visiting Singapore. There are all kinds of Asian & western stalls. Good food, good price. During lunch time it's very crowded with people from the financial district.
4
Famous food court, quite hot during daytime. The satay is very attractive, with prawn, beef, chicken at your choice. We tried the mixed satay set for couple at SD36, not cheap at all for food court price,. But the satay taste fabulous, must try!
5
You can't visit Singapore without coming here
Satay in the street is just sensational
I was also keen on mud crab in the pavilion but didn't have the time
Next time
5
Singapore is famous for the local dishes and seriously it will be boring to come here and just eat at those European restaurant.Here's there's lot of selection and I will recommend the following:-Fried carrot cake /fried Hokkien mee and fried kway tiao / fried oyster egg- these are from the same stall and they are 24 hours.Chicken riceSatay - only at night timeFish soup with beehoon or riceHakka thunder tea rice - not every will like this but I love itTom yum ban mian or their other type of ban mia
4
if your in Sing, come and have dinner here, during the weekdays, they block the street and do satays and beers! I use this place for lunch everyday, it works! For lunch go early to avoid the rush, otherwise dinner is a good option, although dont dress up, go with as little clothing as possible, cause with the bbq steam and weather, you will probably feel fried
4
Hmmmm..... after expensive drinks on top of Marina Bay we headed off for great food.... perhaps too late in the evening as most of the counters were closed. The building was lovely and set up well but the food was disappointing. Also the place only sold beer and soft drinks BUT the tiny 7/11 sold cold wine and bubbles ;
3
Felt stress eating there as you stepped into the area too many people approached you with different types of menu. The Mee Goreng was bad! The prices are too expensive as compare to East Coast Food Centre. They have divided the seating zone. If you ordered from stall 1 you must sit around the area and can't sit too far from them. You will be chased by other stall owner. Don't enjoy the experienc

Lau Pa Sat, also known as Telok Ayer, is the best of the hawker big food court/eateries in our opinion, for food flavour, choices and the venue, when compared to Maxwells, Tanjung Pagar Plaza, 100AM mall -food court Koufu.It is located on Anson rd, and not far from Telok Ayer station. Whilst open all the time the evening meal is the time to go. Outside are the satay stalls. Cooks sweating over their grills with foot high flames. The satays are cheap (70c) and you can individually or in any size bundle you wish. From there you wander inside to all the stalls. This is where the hard part starts. There are so many choices you will spend some time searching for what you wish to eat. We recommend buying a dish and sharing one at a time, and trying as many as you can eat. The budget will not suffer, as food is cheap. The Dim Sum stall has prawn dumplings to die for. The Indian curry and naan bread also was great. Really all the food is good, and you canâ€™t go wrong. Most meals are about the $4 mark, Dim Sum cheaper.The building is about 100 years old and has been renovated, and the ambience is great.Definitely recommend eating here
5
Hello,I visit this food court almost daily during luncgbas it's just few metres away from my office. This place has every possible cuisine and at a very reasonable price. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone working near Raffles or Telok Ayer to visit this food court once
5
Have a great tasty of local food at this place, Cheap and fun to try many kinds of food here. Don't miss to visit this.
4
Went here twice for lunch and dinner. Lunch was packed with CBD workers grabbing a quick lunch, dinner more tourists. Many delicious choices. Satay Street has very inflated prices so we have that a miss!
4
There's a lot of food stalls to choose from and plenty of space during the day. A good place for decent lunch for an affordable price, in the middle of the business district.
4
We never failed to visit this place everytime we go to singapore :) hokers are the best, lots of food choices, bbq chicken wings are the best :) I also loved the meh goreng noodles and the sugar cane juice is very refreshing. This place is recommended for those who loved real finger food *-*. Should try this whenever you visit singapore..
3
I have been a few times to LPS before and after its long renovation. It's on the tourist map and maybe with good reason, it will give you an experience to eat like a local working in the city and it does have some history to it.The selection and variety of differing cuisines should entice all but it is cheap food for a reason. Not all the places are clean and the food is pretty low quality in my opinion hence paying S$3 for a meal. Worth a look as a tourist but on the other hand what are you doing in the CBD as a tourist
3
Took my mum and aunt for street food tonight. Ate Satay, Stingray, Scallops and Baby Kailan. Food was good but pricy the out door seating ok as it was not to hot tonight. Worth the experience if you want to try simple outdoor food but turn up after 7:00pm. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant. Ambience ⭐️⭐️⭐️Menu Selection ⭐️⭐️⭐️Service ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Food Quality ⭐️⭐️⭐️Portion Size ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Value for Money ⭐️⭐️Average Rating: 3.1 
3
An interesting experience. So much choice, even though not all stalls operating the night we visited. They close off the side street for the Satay bbqs - a busy scene with a number of Satay stalls to choose from. Unfortunately ours were a little dry and chewy but still enjoyed the atmosphere. Worth a visit
4
My first time back in Singapore for 3 years and I always make a point of stopping at Lau Pa Sat for a lunchtime snack & a Tiger Beer - so many foods to choose from! Mind you I did not try the "Pig Organ Soup" as advertised at one of the stall
5
Do you like lots of food options? Want a nice mix of locals and tourists? Want amazing thai, indian, vietnamese, malay, and indonesian food under one roof. Look no further. Don't forget to try the Lhaksa and the Char Kwai Teao from the local favorites stall. Also beers ar $5 SG
4
Although Im Singaporean, I took a long time going to Lau Pa Sat after its make over. The weekday parking issues and crowds had kept us away. The visit last saturday was ideal! Loads of space and no queues. The only problem was it took quite a bit of time to choose where to eat considering the variety of choices available from Costa Rican to Japanese pastries....not to mention the usual (and unusual!) South East Asian fare.A must, I definitely reccommend it
4
Lau Pa Sat is one of most famous for every citizen in Singapore.
Newly build and maintenanced well, then we can choose every asian food as we like with the bottom price.
Quite reasonble for everybody!
4
Honestly I only go there for my all time favourite satay stall called SATAY POWER. Power indeed. Tender chicken meat, flavourful mutton and very nicely chargrilled. They are at stall no.6 once the street closes at 7pm. Ask for Lisa or Ibrahim. No regrets.
5
love the spread of different cuisines & the food was tasty, must visit for people who are travelling
5
Went to Lau Pa Sat nightly Hawkers for Satay!! They close off the street at 7:00pm and grill satay for hours!! It had been years since I had been able to eat it because I have not found a place in the states! This place was great!! Stalls 7&8 called "Best Satay", the best!!! Definitely worth your while if in Singapore!!
4
A must do in Singapore! Perfect way to enjoy a variety of Singaporean food whilst getting the most culture. Have been several times during my four month stay in Singapore and enjoyed something different each time. The satay is a must do also - Stall 8!! Would keep going back.
4
Ambience is really nice at night. The satay resteraunts are good. They shut a street down next to lau pa sat and serve it there. The seating is nicer inside Lau pa dat though. The selection inside is mind boggling! The Turkish food inside really sucked though....avoid!!
5
Be there by 7pm. The road wil be closed up for stalls. You can smell and taste all delicious snack such as fried big prawn, chili soto, and others wonderfull snack.Be mindfull.. only order the package meal which give you the most valuable worthMust try..
4
This a great place near many of the hotels to get cheap, good food and a beer in a pretty pavilion. The pad thai I had was half the price I could get it in the US. Don't miss the satay vendors out front. Be sure to walk around before choosing, there are a ton of stands and different cuisines
4
found the place very huge and have lots of food, drinks and desserts choices. Went there late at night and the place was still busy. The breaded shrimp and sauteed kangkong were delicious! Also ordered corn and redbean dessert with shaved ice and milk. The sour lime with plum was the best
5
The food here is quick, tasty and just yum!! Tried Stingray for the first time and it was just beautiful!! To locals, it's expensive street food. But as a traveler it's great. Not as cheap as you can get in other places, but well worth the experience.
4
We had all the family here for a satay night. It is a little overwhelming for novice travellers but our restaurant seemed to be good value and had tasty satay. I suspect it is hard to go wrong with so much competition around.
5
Great Satay with peanut sauce, i chose the first one on the street. Various kind of food that you can find. The most annoying part is the sellers who always attack you or even almost force you to order their restaurant.
5
Fantastic tasty food in a great central location. Lau pa sat offers you every variety of south East Asian food, at reasonable prices, and the cold beer is delivered to your table. This is where I take visitors to Singapore.
5
We love this hawker market and we usually stay at the Sofitel So which is directly across the road! Lots of stalls to choose from and the place particularly comes alive at night. Definitely recommended for a cheap night out!
5
Very good hawker centre in the middle of the financial district. Great variety of food. Really liked the "carrot cake".
4
There is a decent variety indoors throughout the lunch/dinner hour, but come a bit later in the evening for the satays! We tried Stand 8 and it was very delicious.
5
We were told of this place by a cab driver and were so glad we did not miss out on this experience. Wonderful assortment of food stalls! Very clean and fun atmosphere. This place is a must visit for people looking to try out Singapore's food scene
5
Having lived in Singapore for years we finally got around to experiencing the legend that is Lau Pa Sat. It definitely exceeded expectation with the rapid delivery of cold beer and perfectly cooked satay of every variety you could imagine. I can't wait to go again
4
Today I get my lunch at lau pa sat singapore, when I saw indonesian spice my eyEs really like woowww.. this the one indonesian food down here, "Indonesian Spice" I love food the name of the stall, I have try the ayam panggang set, oh my God really tasty, really nice, and I saw on the menu have a Gado gado this the one also nice purely like indonesian food, this stall really nice have a good taste, good enough clean, the seller also good and kind, they said just open this stall about 2 weeks, but surely I really love this indonesian food, and tomorrow promise I want to try the soto medan for my lunch, maybe for the day after tomorrow I will try mie gulai, wahhh really thank God for this stall, "indonesian spice" I love food, beside lily's wok, in front of briyani poin
4
Out of all the hawker markets I've been to on my Singapore visit this was the tidiest, with many European visitors. That's not to say that the food was the best but if surroundings matter to you lau pa sat will probably be less intimidating than others. The food was decent overall, the highlight for me was the satays from the Best Satay 7&8 stall outside. The mutton satays were outstanding
3
This place is serving local Asian food at a very decent price. Late afternoon you can eat very nice grilled stingray and satay. Food court to visit for tourist and locals.
4
My wife and I had a meal here during our holiday. The food was tasty and prices were reasonable.
As can be seen from the attached photos, it is a food court with no air conditioning (in case anyone is wondering).
4
Lau Pa Sat is inside central business district and a walking distance from raffels place MRT station. In the evening one of the by roads is closed for vendor to place their stalls. This is mostly all local food fair at one place. Only thing is that this is open air with no aircon. Nice place to have dinner if the party members want variet
3
There is a good selection of market food here, especially the from different countries.Our food was at best average, we chose a Japanese ramen stall and a Chinese chicken rice stall.We have been to Tiong Bahru Market and found this to be much less touristy and full of locals and we had fantastic food here a few times
3
I was excited to visit this old hawker centre (amongst six food centres in my trip to Singapore), knowing it had been around for over a hundred years. However, it's been renovated, and obviously plenty of money has been rolled into it, so now it's just a food court like you could find in any major city. Unlike Singapore's other hawker centres, the stalls are staffed by teenagers who obviously don't care about the food as much as the owners would, the prices are expensive for Singapore, and the cuisines are not local - there's Korean, Japanese, and even Costa Rican. Skip this place and head to Tiong Bahru, People's Park, or buy your food at 7-11 - it's just as Singaporean as this place
3
I visit the Food Court, bcos my friehd suggest me to try the oyster omlette and bbq stingray. For me The taste is so standart, But you should try it, this is the hang out place for the local citizen of singapore. so the experince you will get it when you came into this food court is you feel like singporean .
5
Our taxi driver recommended this place and it really was the best! So much choice, such a lovely atmosphere sitting with the locals, what a choice of food. You simply find a table and order from whichever eatery you fancy. Lovely to eat real local food and nice to get away from up market Singapore. Also the beer here is not as overpriced lol! Took a bit of finding (not the best map reader) I think we walked in the wrong direction from the station but is a lot of other bars and i think some temples nearby too so don't worry if you go a tad wrong
5
Ate here for lunch and then for dinner - great place to eat.For lunch we had a mix of prawn, prawn and vegetable and bean curd dumplings.. All amazing! Also had Indian the vegetarian chapati plate (the lentil and eggplant dishes were yum) look for the one served with brown paper on the tray only downside chapati was cold For dinner we went for the satay and had chicken and prawn satays from Best Satay. As the name suggests the satay were great, add to this the friendly service and good atmosphere and it makes for a great treat. You can go to fancy restaurants anywhere in the world but while you have the opportunity to experience this I think it's worth it.Tip - ask for cold water as often warm sat out on the benchesThere is a man selling packets of hand wipes about $2 which I found well worthwhile investment after eating the prawns
5
We ate here at Lau Pa Sat every day of our stay in Singapore. Our hotel was just across the road so therefore very handy. There are so many different stalls to choose from Chinese, Indian, Malay and more. The satay club takes over a road each evening adding more options. Plenty of clean tables/chairs make for a pleasant cheap very good eating option. Not sure why anyone would eat in a expensive restaurant while in Singapore when there are so many good eating options here and other Hawker centres. One thing I did notice from our last visit here some years back is that you can no longer order at a stall then have the meal brought to your table other than during the satay nights. So grab a table first, reserve it with a packet of tissues then go get what you fancy. The place gets very busy in the afternoon lunch hour with office staff, this to me proves how good the food is. Evenings are more of a tourist thing but still loads of locals eating out. Great place give it a try when in Singapore.
4
This place is recommended for satay, let's go through the market inside to the opened area behind, you can find an interesting place with full of people around. We ordered satay set 1 (for 1 people) from Satay No.7&8, as recommended. The beef and chicken is ok, but the shrimp is not fresh. The taste is not as what we expected. If you want to try the satay just for reference, let's choose the smallest set. Sitting there, you will be approached by other restaurants around, let's choose the food you want. We ordered baby squid, samba vegetable and fried tofu from BBQ seafood. The veg and tofu is good, the squid is dry, no fresh, S$10 for each squid and tofu, S$15 for veg, overpriced, I think. Inside the hawker, there are lots of choices for other dishes.
4
Lot of eating options ranging from Chinese, Asean, Indian food. You need to reserve the table and then get the food as it is very crowded during week day lunch hours.
4
Great satay and the Thai food is awesome. Take your time choosing your food, ignore the touts and go inside and do a lap first.
4
If you visiting Singapore and looking to try the local hawker / street food then this is a great option. Plenty of variety, good quality and easy to navigate. It's very popular so you'll be among the crowds and feel part of the action!
5
Ask for Bobo. Best service there!!! The satay is amazing. Love that crowdy melting pot! Should try fish next time! hope to come back!

We visited a few hawker centre and found this one the best. We visited twice, one for lunch and one for dinner.Since it is located in a business area, you have to go before 12:00 for lunch. We arrived at 11:30 and was empty but after we ordered and started to eat, found out that was full of people from the offices by noon time. The food and variety was amazing and very cheap as all the hawkers in Singapore
5
This hawker centre was beautiful inside and the air con was great. We first ate outside at best satay 7&8 and then came indoors for more food. There were a number of stalls for satay and we noticed the less popular ones came inside to grab customers. They would deliver the satay indoors but only if they could remember where you were sitting - it's a big place after all, and we were approached with other people's food
5
Upon arrival in Singapore I told my taxi driver I was keen to have some good satay whilst here, he recommended the best place was Lau Pa Sat, and he was spot on. On my last night here I dropped by Lau Pa Sat for my satay hit, arriving at six as I wasn't terribly sure when things kicked off. The street actually doesn't close off till 7pm, so you're best arrive closer to this time or later. As I was by myself I got a small set for $35, my god there was nothing small about it, there was ten sticks of meat, and ten prawns, plus some white stuff I had no idea what it was but was mild in taste. The satay sauce was to die for it was so good, slightly spicy, I was in heaven, I would return to Singapore for this alone. This is a must visit when holidaying in Singapore, you won't be disappointed.
5
Found this on our last night, wish we found it on our first. Lots of great food stalls and very cheap. Cost us $9 for two main meals. Out the back is the Satay Street so you can have your satay hit. Also very cheap beer (by Singapore standards) $19 a jug. Definitely worth a visit to taste it for yourself.
5
Finally had a chance to have satay and grilled seafood at Lau Pa Sat (it has been closed for several years for refurbishment). The atmosphere is unbeatable. Very very delicious. Also try noodle and other food inside, not as impressive as the grilled items. Sitting outside close to the satay stalls is too smoky and we prefer to sit inside. Just ask the staff to bring the satay inside and pay
5
My husband and I visited here one night and I was keen to try some dumplings (dim sum?) So I found a place, and they were honestly amazing! Plus the price was excellent, maybe $1 or $2 for 2. Next time Im in Singapore I will be making a special trip! Store name: Bao Luo Wan Xiang - Dim Su
5
Loved sitting out in the street as we watched the numerous satay being prepared. Absolutely delicious. Highly recommend No. 7&8 fantastic service and food.
5
Over the last year, I have literally gone around and eaten at every single stall in Lau Pa Sat and can say that it's a great experience. You see hundreds of tourists and locals every day and the food is amazing.
5
This is a great place to eat Chinese, Malay, Indian food. What you need to know is when you sit down many people will give you menus - each one is a different vendor. So order what you want off each menu..they will deliver it to your table and you will receive one bill. Drinks are limited to sodas and beer. Food is delicious
4
It's an experience that assaults the senses, loud, smokey and you hope the satay is of a temperature that won't blow your mind. Bring your wet wipes and tissues, be prepared this is no fine dining experience but it's fun and great as a tourist we ate from stall number 3. Bring a camera, locals say avoid the seafood
5
Not a place to eat when you are pregnant as you don't know where many of the street hawkers have sourced their meat from. But for travellers on a budget or local office workers alike, this is an ideal place to pick up cheap eats. I particularly recommend the local satay teams outside who hawk and deliver directly to your table. Be sure to take your packet of tissues to secure your table on a busy day and as your serviette as none are provided. Great local food options from across south east asia.

Lau Pau Sat had something for everyone in our travelling group, even 1 very fussy 12 year old eater. The style of foods were many & varied from authentic Singapore Malay, Japanese, Indian, Thai, Italian, Seafood, Western to fish & chips. 2 large plates of Kway Teoh cost $12 Singapore dollars & a jug of Tiger Beer (5 large glasses $19. At nighttime the street behind the food hall is closed off, plastic tables & chairs come out & the street becomes satay street. Many vendors & satay carts line the street but we found some were better than others. Go where the crowds are & you won't go wrong. 1 vendor provided no plates or napkins & told us to throw our rubbish on the ground. We weren't happy with that or his food to be honest so we didn't go back to him. Tried a different are the next time & food, service (plates, napkins ect) was much better. Best advice there is so much to choose from, take your time, walk around see what's on offer & where the locals are eating. Kids enjoyed the variety of food & it was a great way of getting them to try different things
4
We really enjoyed the satay, quality was great, peanut satay sauce was extremely tasty. Will plan on going again if we can fit it in. It was getting old the same guy asking us to buy tissues by the tenth time in under 10 minutes. Few other pushy touts, but still worth doing, just be prepared for it and get what you came for
5
Newton Circus is under restoration and won't be completed until April 2016. For street style food We were re-directed to Lau Po Sat and it turned out to be one of the highlights of the trip. Excellent food, ambience and facilities. We were able to sit outside at dusk and enjoy our food selection while being connection to all the action going on inside. Clean, neat, enjoyable
5
Lau pa sat was close to my hotel and office and were it not for a desire to explore more of Singapore I could have eaten here for breakfast, lunch and dinner.The choice of restaurants is fantastic with all of Singapore's cuisines available and every meal I had there was delicious, especially given that most dishes are no more than 10-15 dollars are most.In addition every night the road alongside is closed and turned in to satay street with hawkers selling delicious satay, which you can sit outside and enjoy, taking in the aromas and the views of the skyline
5
Anyone who heads to Lau Pa Sat food court from morning till midnight will not be disappointed because from breakfast, lunch and dinner variety of food available. Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian, India food, Malaysian food, Singaporean food. Night time it is a heaven place to seat by the road side to have seafood fish grill and satay. Delicious Indian Chicken Briyani, Hot and Cold Drink also Coconut Water. Bakery and Western Food such as Pasta, Pizza
5
Immaculate, freshly cooked food, low prices for large portions, and way too many things to chose from!
4
be a tourist or a local, this food spot is a great hit. with it's diversified choices and reasonably affordable prices. probably the reason why it's always packed especially on weekends... until the wee hours of the morning.
4
One of the best place to get excellent satay. Keep in mind it is still a hawker centre. But the food and especially the satay is great.
3
Went there by net. Walk around market and decide order Tim sum for dinner and add 10 sticks of satay. The food is now average.
3
This Vietnamese stall could be a 'miss' on your list. The broth for the Pho is watery and lacks depth of flavor. Try something else.
4
I went here after work with my boyfriend for a quick bite to eat. IT's a lot cleaner than many other hawkers in the area and has a HUGE selection of different local and international food to try out for a very affordable price. Would recommend anyone in the area to try it out for a quick lunch or dinner
1
I hate to write a review like this but it is my obligation to warn others. Absolutely the worse meal I've ever had in singapore. That's 38 yrs of food experience in a country known for food. It's almost criminal how bad the food is, and the prices they were over charging was obscene. I was showing a friend from out of town and thought it would be great to show her one of singapore's great historical structure. We were shown a table when we first arrived and seeing how my friend wanted to try the black pepper crab, we sat down and ordered from the Boon Tat seafood. A medium black pepper crab $48Small sting ray $10Small dish of vegetables $10If this was jumbos, the crab would have been size XS. Didn't taste anything like black pepper or any pepper at all. They used some black sauce which was slightly sweet. The stingray fish wasn't wry fresh. Small in proportions and questionable. Hope I don't get food poisoning. Vegetables were so gross my friend didn't even bother trying after her first bite.  It's such a disgrace especially since this is a tourist spot where unsuspecting tourists are here to indulge in our cruising but instead get such a horrible experience. I've had bad food but this is by far the worse.
3
If you're after a hawkers market experience in Singapore then this is great. If you're after great hawkers market food then I suspect you can do heaps better than Lau Pa Sat. They close a city street down at night and put tables and chairs in what would be the middle of the road by day. We got plants of satay sticks with chicken, mutton and prawns. The prawns were best by far. We also have Chinese broccoli which was close to the best tasting dish on the night. Add to this a jug of beer and a hot night and the experience is still a good one. Add great friends and this is still a good night
1
Went over for a really late dinner. We placed our order of 20 sticks of satay and grilled prawns and a jug of Tiger beer. We waited for an hour, finished a whole jug of beer between 2 people and the food still never came. We were watching how the guys would swarm over tourists and their food came within 15 minutes or so. How do I know this for sure? We came, sat down and were attended to by the same guy, only thing was that right next to us were two Korean ladies. They received their food really quick while we waited, reminded them, finished our jug of beers and decided to quit waiting. I guess this must be some tourist trap or something with the touts swarming around the tourists while us locals seem to get a shoddy deal.
5
OMG!!!! Foodies Heaven...... Never seen anything like this before. Some many to choose from. Honestly they all look good. Worth coming here to check it out. Pick and choose whatever you like to try. We had satay, chicken rice and fok kin noodles. All of them amazing We Will Be Back..........
4
Street food in a semi-organized way, what I was looking for was the traditional Sati (beef, chicken, and shrimp) barbecued in front of you with tasty peanuts sauce and rice cakes.
3
Not the best food we had, there are more places around that serve better food, was a little disappointed after all the other food we had sampled.
5
What a place this is!! They close the road after all the offices have closed and set up street food outlets in the road. Prawns, chicken satay and Tiger Beer!! If you come to Singapore you MUST come here!!!
4
If you can't find food of your liking at this place your too fussy! We went there at the lunchtime peak and it was a great experience. We wondered around the place and checked out what the locals where eating and then chose what to have. Plenty of variety to choose from, fresh food, fast service and cheap
5
We turned up here after a few drinks with friends and not knowing where to eat on our first night in Singapore. Lau Pa Sat is situated in the middle of the high-rise, well lit, modernistic buildings of Singapore. We arrived at around 10.30pm and the place was buzzing for all of locals, tourists and expats. It truly was a fantastic atmosphere to be apart of. The food's great and the prices are greater! An absolute must
5
Well it seemed like it as we excitedly walked in on a rainy Friday night. The place was already full at 6.30 pm , despite the rain and business was booming.The clientele were a mix of Singaporeans, expats and tourists, all of whom were ticking in and having the time of their lives at this extraordinary dining experience.The food is varied and plentiful. We found a seat and walked around to see what was available , settling for satay, dim sum, whole fried fish with beer and barley water to wash it down.No visitor to Singapore should miss this.Just one request for the management to consider -- please improve service at the taxi stand: it was very slow
4
This is a nice place and is open till late hours of the day. In downtown area, this is a very good cheap food option available late night. The satay here are good. The seafood restaurants are a must visit. This is a nice place to take your friends and family, have some beer and eat fresh seafood
4
Lau Pa Sat is a good food court/hawker center in Downtown Singapore. It has more international foods (Japanese, Korean, Middle Eastern, even Costa Rican) than most food courts, and a good selection of Singaporean and Chinese classics. It is weak on Malay and Indonesian food. Popular, but prices are still reasonable, and can always find a table. No air con, but if you get too hot, you can escape to the air conditioned dessert shop. Most stalls are open on Sunday, which is unusual in downtown
4
All kinds of Asian food is available at a very reasonable price. You can infact find multiple shops serving same cuisine so choice is not a problem. There was one joint selling Indian chaat as well! Recommended over the eateries around the bay unless you want to have food while enjoying the bay. Expect huge crowd in noon as people working in cbd descend to this place in groups of all sizes,even at 12.00pm. Fast service so less queue. This is one place you can find food at 1.00am in night as well. After 7pm the road next to it is occupied by street food vendors so even more options.
5
This is a fantastic way to experience food like the locals. Really good food at amazing prices! Select what you want and when it's put on a tray, go and find a table, inside or out. If you buy a fruit juice at the fruit juice counter this will set you back more than the meal! Loads of ice in the juice but in the heat, this soon melted, watering down the flavours quite a bit. Do go though, you will be amazed. Never thought we would eat so cheaply and well in a city like Singapore
4
This is a place where you can a taste of Singapore. Chinese, Malay and Indian foods. I've brought friends from overseas here and they love it. Be ready to have lots of tissues though to wipe your sweats.
4
Went there with husband and son, my son had pizza, I had pho and my husband had noodle soup, all $4-$5 which I think is great value in Singapore. It's clean, with heaps of seating
5
A fun place to eat, and very cheap. Stakeholders outside sell satay prawn and chicken. Stalls inside sell Indian, Chinese and Singaporean food. Try buying a selection from different stalls. Central stall sells drinks. Very good, cheap food.
5
Was very impressed at how modern and clean this food centre is! We also came back late one evening (after 11pm) and sat outside on the street, and ordered from the No.8 satay stall which is one of the local favourites.
5
It can be very confusing when you first arrive at the hawker market. There is so much choice and many of the stall owners are asking you to sit down. We decided to sit away from the smoke of the satay stalls but outside where it was cooler. We had THE BEST satay and peanut sauce ever. The beer was cold but not cheap (which is expected in Singapore). Don't use the toilets! All in all a great place for great food. We loved the atmosphere and buzz of people even later in the evening
5
If you missed the local (Singapore) food, this is one of the best place for dinner and so much choices like fresh grilled seafood, hong kong mee, mee siam, rujak, vegetarian, fresh sugar cane juice with an array of Singaporean deserts, of course the cold beer while seated in the open or at covered space. My family enjoyed all the foods we ordered and it's inexpensive. I will be back again. . .my best bet is grilled sting ray with balachan (Malay chili paste)
5
This beautiful old hawker building in the middle of the financial center sky scrapers is really a special place. Great variety of food from barbecue scewers, to excellent Dim Sum, various Chinese food and also a great Turkish food stall. Pricier than other hawker places but not terribly so. Good fun to see all the worried bankers rushing past on the way from (or too?) work
5
Six of us went to this food center near Chinatown area in Singapore. It is huge & the choices are many. It is very clean & there are a wide variety of dishes, soups & desserts. Chinese, Korean, Indian & more. The prices are very reasonable, too. We enjoyed it so much! The only problem was trying to decide what to have. We didn't have time to go back or we would have eaten there every day
4
Satey street. Great place to taste the local cuisine. Amazing sate at stall nr 7&8, called best sate. Friendly people and not a tourist trap. You order your Satey at stall 7&8 and other side dishes you can order from different waitress who come by. You pay everything separate. It's a must to try when you visit Singapore.
4
This place offers a huge variety of cuisine. From dumplings to noodles to ramen. The Satay area outdoors is tremendous. With hawkers inviting you in to try food in every direction it can be a little crazy but definitely good crazy! I liked the satay prawns and there was other food on offer too like steamed veg and clams etc. There were a few dessert places and beers served in jugs. A nice place to try authentic cuisine. Give it a go
4
Great variety good food. Cheap. Visited with 9 friends so everyone can have a large variety to choose from. I went for the satay. Delicious
5
Hands down, this was the best, biggest, cleanest Hawker Centre of any of the numerous we visited on our recent Singapore holiday. There are many different varieties of food, including the famous satay. Heaps and heaps of tables meant we did not have to wait around to find a seat, and we were here at the busy after work time. You could eat here every day easily - offers such a huge range of different cuisines. Awesome place!
5
Always fresh and a great quality for 15 SGD (usually had a laksa or dim sums + salad followed by fresh fruit and a sugar cane juice). Open until approx. 9 pm evening.Eat there 3 weeks in 2015 at different stores and never had any issue or disapppointmen
3
Positiv is that the place is open air and that it offers all kind of local Singaporean food. If you do self service and order directly from the small stalls, the price will be ok, if you get served directly at your table, be careful and have the prices confirmed before ordering. The chicken with dried chilles is delicious and the best satees are made at stall 3/4!
4
In my reading prior to coming to Singapore, there were several hawker markets which were repeatedly mentioned, and this was not one of them. I went to (those) other hawker markets and subsequently realized that they were more 'tourist' markets - Lau Pa Sat is the real thing! Much bigger than the other markets with a larger variety of types of food, good quality, better prices and easier seating, a much more attractive option to experience street food
5
In my previous review, I complained about poor cleaning. I’m glad to say, that’s been sorted out.The toilets are splendid (and free). There are no dirty tables. In short, it’s as clean as any other food court.It would be worth coming here to enjoy the building, which is a beautiful pre-war cast iron market. But in addition there’s a fantastic range of food, from all over the earth! It’s all about the great diversity of people who now make up Singapore.It gets very busy at lunchtimes Monday to Friday, as a lot of office workers come here. However we have visited on cloudy days, and easily found a table at the edge (without shade), an added bonus is the fantastic view of the financial district; also tables around the edge are cooler. When we have visited outside the busy lunchtime, it’s been easy to find spaces.Our favourite stalls are the Costa Rica stall for its delicious salad, and also the Dim Sum stall. The latter never has a queue, even at busy times, because they are very fast at serving.This food court is a great asset to the city, and a splendid place to enjoy food. Don’t miss it
4
For those who want a taste of the famous satay, this is the place to be. You'll be spoilt for choices- from mutton, beef, chicken to prawn satay. There are also other local cuisines to choose from like barbecued stingray, Chilli crabs and char kway teow. It's better to go for dinner before 7.00pm as the place gets crowded after that. The nearest MRT station is Raffles Place.
4
If you like to experience Singapore and their outdoor food stalls this is a great place to visit. Can be really busy but worth a visit when you are in Singapore. The Satay is lovelly. Just park yourself at a table and the food stall teams will find out
2
Definitely a place to visit, we've been there twice and both times experienced: lack of free tables, personnel unable to speak word of English, the entire concept of hurrying between food stalls while carrying your tray is just not me. Food it cheap, but poor quality, large portions, but greasy and difficult to eat with plasticky soft cutlery. If you enjoy eating while you walk, don't mind heat, noise and crowd then it might be the place for you. Please observe the working conditions for the poor people working there. Unbelievable ..
5
Went last night to try the satay sticks which I had read on previous reviews before coming here. My partner and I shared the smallest number of Satays on the menu at stall 8 which was about $26 Singapore dollars in total. You get a mix of prawns, chicken and beef. Service was great and food was delicious! Definitely an experience not to be missed when visiting Singapore
4
Always coming back to launpa sat for a quick dinner and SATAY definitely... The food is a little pricey given its location... But it's worth the try... Highly recommended...
5
The street between Lau Pa Sat and Sofitel is closed each day from 7 PM to 2AM and is filled with tables and you can taste excellent satay and other street food. A must do in Singapore!
4
I visited Lau Pa Sat (Telok Ayer Market) on the 2nd day of Chinese New Year with my family and most of the stalls were closed. When we were there, there were workers from the Satay Club asking us if we want to eat satay. As we wanted to walk around to see what other varieties of food there were, we kindly rejected them.In the end, we ate satay from a particular stall which send their staff surveying the market to sell their satay to customers. The menu comes in different set. We ordered Set A which has 10 chicken satays, 10 mutton satays, 10 beef satay and 10 tiger prawns. You can mix and match the satay even though it comes in a set. So we ordered 20 chicken satays, 10 turkey satays and 10 tiger prawns. YES TURKEY SATAYS! It didn't taste like turkey though... Oh and the shell of the tiger prawns were removed, so it was easy to eat. Next time when I visit there, I want to try the Costa Rican cuisine!How to get there?Lau Pa Sat is a short 5-minute walk from Downtown MRT Station. If you happen to be at Marina Bay Sands or Esplanade Bridge to see the Merlion, you may want to settle a meal at Lau Pa Sat. It is about 10-15 minutes walk only
5
I absolutely love to come here to Lau Pa Sat. Perhaps it's because of the sentimentality of being here on my very first visit to Singapore (and all subsequent ones), perhaps it's the old Victorian architecture and open air market or the wonderful smells that fill the hall. Maybe it's the spectacle of watching the food hustlers bringing menus and beer and Satay and watching confused newbies trying to figure out the system, but all I can say is if you want to have a uniquely fun dining experience and delicious Satay (Stand Number 6!!!) you must come here. Try the blackened stingray, too! After one or two visits, you will have your favourite vendors and be welcomed back with smiles of remembrance
4
Was surprised to find more than half the stalls closed, but I suppose some have to have a break. Found the satay stands outside most inviting and had a couple plates of satay sticks and (large) prawns. Bit more expensive than inside, but still very good value at $36. Haven't eaten a whole prawn for quite a while; a good experience
3
If you're looking for legendary and historical food court of S'pore, this is the place. There is a sign tells the history of this place.Lau Pa Sat represents the culture of Singapore, food from Chinese cuisine, Malays specialties, Indian delights and even Turkish signatures. Yes they have food stall that provide for halal food/ vegetarian. Just look for the halal sign.The surrounding was OK but we hate the public restroom. It was dirty and crowded. Even it was not comfy just to wash our hands
5
This gigantic sprawling foodcourt in the middle of the financial district offers every Asian cuisine available. At lunch time it is packed with business people grabbing lunch, so finding a table can be tricky. At night the close off the street behind it and it becomes a wonderful satay street food market. Vendors try and lure you to their tables. Friends who live in SG took me here for dinner on my first night. Chicken and beef are recommended, lamb is not as it tends to be a bit chewy. I also tried Sting ray and 'carrot cake' which is actually veggie side dish. A fun way to experience Singapore at night
5
After reading great reviews for Lau Pa Sat we knew we had to visit. We initially walked into the market and walked around but it wasn't until we went outside that we were taken away. The street is closed off and is filled with stalls and tables and chairs and the amazing smell of satay. I had read about number 7 satay being great. Every stall outside is a satay skewer store, all numbered. Number 7 and 8 is where we chose and it was delicious. We got 10 chicken, 10 beef and 6 prawn satay skewers for $26 SGD, which was all delicious and a great price (and delivered to your table). There were also larger serves to choose from. The stalls inside were also very good, heaps of variety of asian foods and plenty of places to sit. There is also a few drink stalls with soft drinks or juices. Ladies in Tiger beer uniforms come around and take your order for a Tiger beer ($5) or a soft drink. As soon as you walk past a stall you will be approached by workers trying to grab you a table and show you their menus. A polite no thank you or we're still looking will send them away. Also, good idea to bring your own tissues or wet ones to wipe your hands as there is no napkins. There were some people selling tissues for $1.Make sure you bring cash and try a few different things, it was a great experience
5
Food court in the middle of business Area of Singapore . Nice place to try some delicious dishes like satay and oyster omelette or chilly crab (not most delicious ) . So many choices of food and cuisines . Indian , Thai , west , Chinese and local dishes .
4
This Food Hall is generally rated to be among the top five or six ''Hawker'' food places to visit in Singapore , and it most probably deserves the distinction . Since the site of the late much-lamented Satay Club was buried under concrete and asphalt those many years ago , the tradition of grilling satay over coals seems to have moved to the pedestrianised street outside Lau Pa Sat . The satay seems to be as good , but the ambiance is now sadly diminished . You'll be offered satay at 20 sticks at a time ( which obviously reduces your ability to ingest the other food styles available ) but one can easily persuade the vendors to reduce the order to 10, if there are just two of you ,,,, unless you just want to gorge on satay alone .There'll probably be a longish wait for the order to be served , as the place is popular , and generally crowded . The price for satay is 70 cents a stick , which now seems to be the going rate in Singapore .Inside , the ''ethnic'' choice is large and varied , whether eating or drinking . Most of the dishes are at least good , and occasionally are excellent . There's a bit of luck involved , as well as one's personal tastes . Prices are usually under $10 per dish . Being under cover ( and the architecture of this old market building is an attraction in itself ) there is full protection from bad weather . In fact , it's possible ( given the general noise and bustle inside) for one to be quite unaware a major thunderstorm is raging outside . Go for the experience , as well as the food 
5
If you like Asian food, you will love the Lau Pa Sat. Chinese, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Indian...here everybody will find something.
And for a drink you obviously have a sugar cane juice.
4
So many food stalls, there are 3 Filipino food in here.
Everytime that I'm missing home I always eat here. This is also home to my favorite chicken biryani.
4
While this is a hawkers market for street food, the setting is very British, down to the big bell in the center which chimes out the time.
There is not that much of variety, mainly Chinese oriented with a few Indian places.
4
I was staying in Sofitel So and it is located in front of the hotel, there are many kind of food selections, also open 24/7.
5
We arrived early into Singapore and were just going to grab a coffee here but got swayed by the fruit stall, then the hainan chicken stall etc etc. There's a great satay market outside at night too. It's open air but surprisingly cool.
4
If you like kebabs and a just a casual quick visit , please to go. I found the food is good but not great where you count the days to go again. You're looking to pay around S$9/- per person w/o starter or drinks, with starter to share w/o drinks you will have to pay around S$11/- per person
5
What a place !!! Eat till you drop with traditional local and international food. delicious, cheap, friendly and right in the heart of Singapore. A must visit for everyone ! Love it. Oh and do yourself a favour- Get your satay from stall 7 or 8 !!
5
A must when visiting ...one of the best food halls with an extensive array of taste sensations and cheap !The satays are cheap and incredibly tasty.The chilli crab whilst being one of the more items available is still cheap compared to home and should not be passed over.Jugs of beer are a perfect compliment to the food.Visited twice in the few days in the city
5
Always spend my first night here when I come to Singapore. Great variety of local food. Just pick a table and order a variety of different things from the many stalls. Seafood is great especially satay prawns. Make sure you find the satay king. Always good fun and atmosphere
5
Known for it's SATAY... however Lau Pa Sat has a great variety of choices for all... a perfect spot to start the evening.... Great Food, Great Value, Centrally located....You cannot go wrong.... been there on a few visit to Singapore for work... this time was Holiday....it's just always great spot to kick start the evening.... or eat and retire if your tired.... :
3
Its location is very convenient but it is nothing special quality wise. I tried Turkish dish and chinese dish. They were so so....
4
Great variety of food in this hawker centre at very reasonable prices. Plenty of seating available mid-week although the sate area around the backs gets very busy. Always a good stop for good food when in Singapore.
4
Really nice pavilion selling street food / hawker food. Lots of cuisine options - Chinese, Thai, Indian, Malay, ... Everything!! Very cheap. Very crowded. And very good! Incredible to see something like this in the Marina business district.
4
Not much more one can add here. The building itself is what I bring friends to see. Wonderful Scottish workmanship, and if you get a chance to look up into the bell tower as the clock strikes the hour...The satay outside is great and inside you are spoilt for choice, though it's geared for the ex-pat/tourist market, they do good food. For example I got a naan platter, with 3 veggie dishes and some chicken tikka for S$7, so the value is there.It's a good introduction to the real hawker centres which are outside of the central area
5
Need I say more? Lau Pa Sat is famous for its Satay, coated across either Beef, Chicken or the slightly more expensive Shelled King Prawns. If you like Satay, a vibrant atmosphere and sitting in the middle of a commercial street in the evening, then you've found it.Lau Pa Sat is split into two distinct areas - Indoors/Outdoors. The Indoor option, built by the British when they colonized Singapore many years ago, is retrofitted to be a large Hawker station with a huge variety of cheap but very tasty small meals. You'll be surprised by some of the things on offer here, so be warned! The Outdoor option is where the real experience begins - closing the main adjacent street in the evening and decking it out plastic chairs and tables, it becomes and outdoor eatery serving fresh, hot and amazing satay dishes. Sitting in the middle of the street, surrounded by towering sky scrapers is an experience in itself.You'll be seated as you approach - often by one of the local hawker owners, who will give you their menu first - and asked to order. Most menus are roughly the same, with the occasional western burger menu thrown in. Once you've ordered, you'll be bombarded with a number of other hawker stall owners offering their additional range - a polite No Thank-You will send them on their way.One of the best foodie experiences you will have in Singapore, no doubt

The building was decidedly maintained its original look. It's interesting as the whole area were all modern buildings. You'll want to come early or late,as in 12:00 - 13.00 you'd likely cannot get empty seat.Inside you'll find many food stall which offer Singaporean, Indonesian, India, Thai, and if I remember correctly - Costa Rica!. Expect to spend SGD 10-15 per person.Tips: wear something comfortable. There was no air-conditioner here
4
A huge food court where you can find different cuisines to your liking. There's chinese, malaysian, indonesian, indian, american and filipino food. You just need to have the patience to locate where it is on this large place. Since this place closely resembles hawkers style food, expect that it will suit your budget.However, this can be found at the heart of their business district; this is not a very accessible to all

Feels like the modern version of the old Satay Club! Lots of satay sellers cook their sticks in a row at the back of the pavilion. Great food. Clean. Easy to get around but very popular with locals and tourists. Will definitely be a return visitor!
4
This food court is the closest place to my hotel, so I stumbled upon it my first day in town. It has an open market feel with plenty of food vendors offering up lots of Asian food, juices, drinks, and sweets. I wasn't too adventurous and opted for chicken and rice. The chicken had some grisly parts so I'm not giving it 5 stars, but the flavor was great. I'll likely go back to try another vendor or two while I'm here. Worth a visit.
5
Great hawkers food - plenty of stalls to choose from. We ate fairly early, around 7, was getting busier all the time. Lovely satay from stall 7&8 - S$21 for 30 chicken/beef satays, prawn options are S$2 a skewer. Take a seat on the roadside tables where the satay stalls are in the open and everything else comes to you - vendors selling drinks, including beer, and also delicious roti. There are plenty of other food vendors under the main roof of Lau pa sat with all food options covered.
4
- perennial favourite with tourists and the locals
- in the heart of the Central Business District
- excellent range of local and international cuisine
- visit in the evenings for the satay (many stalls originate from the famous, now-defunct Esplanade Satay Club)
4
I have been to Lau Pa Sat many times and really like it. It is comparatively clean, the food s very good and it simply looks nice. However, it is very touristy, sometimes you get the feelings it is more foreigners than locals eating here.
5
There were 5 of us on our group and there was plenty of choice for everyone. Delicious satay, stingray, noodles, vegetarian dishes. Well worth a visit.
5
I could stay in Singapore a year and eat something different here every night. Actually, I pretty much did that when I did live in Singapore. There's a fantastic choice of food, really competitively priced - what's not to like?
2
Very touristy and poor food. More expensive than other centres. Go elsewhere, don't waste your time or money.
5
We have been here all the time during our stay in Singapore. It has over 100 foods in this market with cheap price. The foods are awesome and we gotta try lots of different local foods.recommend to sit outside during night time, it gives you a nice breeze in such a hot place
5
Best place to find great hawkers style food in Singapore, great selection, spacious and yet can be dauntingly packed during lunch and after office. Come with friends and don't forget to find table first, once you do, don't forget to put those paper tissues you just bought and place them on the table, this is to tell others that the table is yours. You'll see these blocks of paper tissues on every table during lunch time, never ever take any table with them on it, you'll get some people furious.Each time I go to Singapore for an affordable lunch and dinner, I to to Lau Pa Sat. Recommende
5
This place has something for everyones palate. We came early but it was getting crowded when we left. The food is cheap and good. The chilli crab is something you have to try. And if you are going out this is an excellent place to grab something good to eat while having some beers
5
On a 5-day, pre-cruise, stopover in Singapore we were not especially looking for fine-dining (as that would come on the cruise). We had read of the hawker centres and included Lau Pa Sat for its city convenience and for the Victorian architecture.In the event we ate there every day; not because it was inexpensive (which it certainly is), but for the wide range of foods on offer (all depicted in picture form at each of the providers), all great-tasting and in generous portions.The place is humming with activity, both from locals - city workers and tourists - but is big enough to cope with plenty of diners at the same time. While you look for your choice of food from the many on offer, you can 'reserve' your table by placing upon it a packet of tissues. This convention seems to be acceptable all round and works very well.Lau Pa Sat is well worth a visit (or two)
4
Went there with my friends searching for affordable food. According to my friend alot of nice food here as there are many stalls and food to choose from. Price ranging from maybe around 4 dollar and above. Mostly are price above 5 or 6 dollar not as cheap as places like chinatown but still a great place to eat â˜
5
Meals around $5 SDG. This place has great variety and all very cheap. There's Indian food, Chinese stir fry, satay skewers, dumplings, and even pizza. Great atmosphere as well and easy to find a table. I didn't get sick either (bonus). Highly recommended!
4
nice atmosphere, not very fresh shrimps. Often go there when i visit singapore, after renovation it's much more spacious. Try out the packages, the bbq is not bad. Have to purchase drinks yourselves at a seperate, centralised store. The atmosphere is nit bad.
5
We spend our last day here just trying different kind of foods. So much variaty and for a good price. Most of the dishes around 5dollars so good!!!!
5
Historical food court - I was there first in 1992! Still great food done on the spot at best possible price. Highly recommended to enjoy
4
Numerous stalls with a great variety of food, the satay was especially good,they have chicken/mutton/beef/& even turkey satay stalls open till late
4
Best place for cheap street food. There are a variety of stalls, Indian, Turkish, Thai. You must try the signature Singaporean Chilli Crab from Aiman BBQ Seafood as well as the BBQ prawns. My family and I loved it!
5
Probably the coolest of the food courts in Singapore. All the stalls have been renovated since my last visit some years ago, but the food served from them needed no renovation. Great food all around, and for me the highlight was the places serving some really tasty and authentic Indian street food. Hearthy, warming and spicy enough for most people. Really worth a visit
4
We had our best Indian food in this food court. The court is nice and more "upscale" than the food court in Chinatown, and the prices are also slightly higher but still very cheep. What I love the most with this food court is the variety of food that is available here: Japanese, Vietnamese, Indian, Turkish to mention a few. It is certainly worth a visit if you are in Singapore!
4
We went multiple times because it was a few steps of our hotel. So many different food styles! A bit touristy and pricy but worth the experience. Just pic a table and go to the food stands and take your favorite dishes. We tried dumplings, stingrays and of course sate chicken. Gorgeous! 100% recommendation
4
On a Sunday, there were tables set up on the road where all the satay stalls are based. We had the satay and chat kuey teow here. The satay was really good, and they were accommodating to change the combo when we wanted to replace the prawn with chicken and mutton. It averages to about $1 per stick, making it triple the price of the same thing in Malaysia. However, it was good and they used less fats than what you would find in Malaysia. The char kuey teow on the other hand did not taste like one.Recommended for the open air atmosphere and the satay
5
It's located in CBD , and you have a lots of choices that what are you going to eat ! Such as ,fired oyster, fired noodles , Hainan chicken rice
4
So far have been twice, will visit at least two more times before i go. Great variety, fast service and everything is very good. Its crowded, its an institution, if you don't go well then you have not been to Singapore
2
Probably one of my least favourite hawker centre. I only go there with visitors who prefer a sanitized version of hawker food or if I am in the vicinity. But seriously not worth going any distance to eat here. Overpriced and average food. Nothing in particular to recommend. There used to be a good porridge stall, but it has shut down
5
I got a surprise invitation by my close Singaporean Muslim friend and his family just two days ago. They took me to Lau Pa Sat, a street that is busy during the day but closed off at night. There are many halal food stalls you can choose from. I had satay, sweet and sour chicken, some rice and dessert. It was amazing. If you are visiting Muslims, you got to visit this place
4
This very large iconic hawker food centre in Singapore is well worth a visit for any foodie visiting Singapore. The building is iconic and there are so many food stalls to choose from with a vast range of food to choose from.I read about Lau Pa Sat before coming to Singapore and made sure I visited. I visited at Lunchtime when it was quite hot but very busy with many different people including people from the nearby offices. Bit hot for me in here so make sure you get a nice refreshing cold drink as soon as you can1I decided to be a little different and decided to have a Turkish Kebab! This was fairly nice and value for money. I decided to walk around and choose the stall myself. I did not have any tissues however one of the ladies cleaning up was kind enough to pass me her pack of tissues from which I took one.My only regret is not being able to come here more than once to sample the food from the many other stalls! This is something I need to do next time I am fortunate enough to visit SIngapor
4
Been to Lau Pa Sat many times and still love it. Yes people say it is touristy and a bit more expensive than other food courts, but others are not as nice (in terms of architecture) and right in the centre and don't have as much history. If you fancy some satay, just sit outside on the side street and order a portion (min 10 sticks). I always go to stalls numbers 7&8. You can buy other things from any stalls and eat them at the same table as the satay. If you can't find the side street, do not worry, there are loads of people within the market waiting for your business to bring you at their area as there seems to be a lot of competition between satay stalls :
4
Somewhat a must visit food court. It has interesting architecture and great choices of Singaporean food. I came specifically for the stingray, which I found delicious although quite pricey. Anyway all the food here were more expensive than the common food court. It could also be confusing to pick which vendor, but I guess most of the seafood stalls who serve the stingray will provide similar quality. There are sales representatives for the seafood stalls that can will advertise some food for you. The positive thing is that they will take your order and bring the food with you sitting down in your table. So you don't have to walk to a certain stall. The seafood stalls mostly labelled 'halal' so for Muslims it is a good choice. Other specialty of this place was the satay which can be found in the outdoor area but unfortunately I did not buy it because of the limited cash I had that night. But the satay vendors were super busy and crowded I guess it has a really great taste. Will have them next time
4
A hawker center can be compared to an American food court. There are many stalls with different vendors selling different types of ready-to-eat or quickly made food for an inexpensive price. Lau Pa Sat has been redone in the last several years, so it provides a fairly clean, if not completely authentic, hawker center experience. The biggest problem is making up your mind what to eat- you will find traditional Singapore dishes like Chicken Rice along side many other Asian cuisines.Going close to sundown provides a fun experience as the satay stalls right outside Lau Pa Sat (Satay Street) turn on their lights and you get more of a street food experience.Tip: be sure to bring your own napkins/tissues, so you can shoo away the wandering napkin sellers and not have to pay to clean your hands
5
Ok, foodies...If you love to try different foods or if you love food period, you must visit Lau Pa Sat next time you are in Singapore. They have pretty much everything your heart desires. From Sushi to Satay to Seafood they have it all. We ordered from one stall, Chili crab which was $35S. We also ordered Roast Chicken on rice which was $5S.Last but not least XS size satay which was $14S for 20 sticks (10 chicken, 5 beef, and 5 mutton) they were all deliciously prepared and piping hot when it arrives at your table. You can order direct at the stall or flag down the people with menus, they will take your order and deliver it to your table. It is absolutely heaven on earth. Fast food redefined
2
Singaporeans claim to be foodies, but the island nation has some of the worst food in all of South East Asia. The fact that they have to tell you how good the food is, just confirms the opposite. Singapore is all about hype. The reality is that the island is nothing more than an Asian version of Disney World. Everything is fake and the food is about the same quality as what is found in the Magic Kingdom. The Mecca of the Singaporean foodie scene is Lau Pa Sat. It recently had a makeover and it is now somewhat hygienic. Nevertheless, the food is bland and flaccid. Fortunately, it is also dirt cheap. No need to linger around. Order something, pick at it, take a couple of pics and leave. You got your check in the box and make way for Changi Airport--the best thing the island has to offer
5
Asian food? There's so much to choose from here, and it's amazing , great food and very cheap . Nothing better than sitting here with a tray of Asian food and a pitcher of beer of the evening. Gets packed lunchtimes.
4
This hawker centre has many stalls, satays outside on the street! Inside there is a variety of Asian, indian fresh fruit juice & desserts! Prices average around $6!
3
If you unsure about the food cult of Asian, it would be a great place as it has it all under one roof.
4
This was an eye opener to your typical Gaijin, we were sat down on a table and thrust upon with a few menus to choose from, primarily satay sticks of beef, chicken and prawn in varying amounts, we started with an order of those and added as we went along, the atmosphere is electric with people scattered all along in a makeshift outdoor restaurant bustling with activity, quite surreal considering the earlier quiet sidewalk we came across in the day, this is one to see, taste and experience. from my limited experience you shouldn't expect much quality of service in singapore, well certainly from food providers of this ilk, its fast food, reasonably priced and pretty good quality, they aren't into smily faces and have nice day, but if your looking for that go to the states... this is rough and ready food in the east, quality is good, price is reasonable and the atmosphere is electri
3
one of many food courts in singapore. attracks tourists. food quality varies on which stable foid is ordered. up ro individual taste.we go there for only one item: chicken sateh with peanut sauce. there are many stables serving that. just walk by, select the one you like
5
Covered international food court at great prices. plenty of food styles to choose from, we tryed the beef & chicken satay these were excellent also cold beer is available. At night stalls are set up in the steet outside the market food is cooked on charcoal BBQ's the smell is mouth watering. great place for inexpensive and authentic asian food
4
Great food, cold beer & atmosphere. Students, business people, locals & tourists all come together to eat delicious food. There were 5 of us ranging from 7 years to 70 years & there was something for everyone. Satay sticks took a while to be cooked & delivered but worth the wait. The tandoori chicken, clay pot & pork buns were yummy
3
This is a lovely old building, I think the old market place.However , now it seems to me that it could be an international food court anywhere in the world.For us, it didn't have that exciting and authentic feeling of the other hawker centres.However I understand that in the evening the satay stalls are set up outside and that seems like it would feel more like the genuine article
4
The Lau Pa Sat Satay market is located near the CBD of Singapore.At night a satay street is set up at the outdoor area of the food market The barbecue smoke from the charcoal fires is an enticement to come and sample the satays available from the many stalls Prices start about 60 cents per satay stick We were with a group of 8 which made it easy to sample a variety of satays available all very goodA must do thing while in Singapor
4
I spent the majority of the week working in close proximity, and only discovered through colleagues on my last evening. The outdoor seating and casual satay was both overwhelming and enjoyable. Highly recommend Best Satay stall 7 and 8. Be aware that vendors may approach from any stall and offer accompaniments. Extremely authentic - you will go home smelling of the charcoal grills!b Excellent value for mone
4
My local cousin took us here. Amazing enormous food court in the middle of town with a huge variety of fares. I could eat here everyday.
5
Go!
So much choice, such good value, a great option for all to sit down and eat Thai...Indian...Greek... All on a shared table.
From kebabs to 'pig organ soup'!
5
I love this hawker center. Extremely clean and the choice of food is fantastic. Maybe you get cheaper food somewhere else, but the quality here is great.
5
Three generations gathered for an evening meal and the feast went on for 2 hours. There was plenty of options available direct to your table or collected yourself. We had satay, a clay pot, pork buns and tandoori chicken all from different places. The tiger beer was well priced as was the food. The smells from all the stalls was a highlight. Looking forward to returning.
4
Visited this Hawker Center after mid night for some late night food so it didn't have the hustle and bustle of the earlier hours i imagine. Still would recommend this as a must see venue when visiting Singapore.I ordered a portion of chicken satay and deep fried chicken wings which arrived quickly, were tasty and succulent. Although I still enjoyed my visit, I was slightly annoyed the mass congregation of vendors pestering me for my business when i was walking around
5
If you're after a good hawker centre under cover but not in a shopping mall, this is the place. Countless stalls have been set up in an old food market. Apparently this place is open 24 hours. There is a great selection of food from around the region. Quality is high, prices are low. Hustle and bustle of a traditional hawker centre with locals, ex-pats and tourists all enjoying the variety. Large fans in the ceiling help deal with the heat. There is also a chiming bell that rings loudly on the quarter hour so you can easily keep track of your visit. This place is easy to get to using the MRT station at Raffles Place followed by a signposted walk of less than five minutes

Having heard much about the nightime satay street stalls at Lau Pa Sat (the Old Teluk Ayer Market), my wife and I made it a point to have a satay feast here in the evening of Wednesday 4th November 2015 on our Singapore holiday.We got there fairly early by taxi, and looked around the market and explored the surrounds before the normal commencement time of 6:30 p.m. for the satay stalls. We sized up each of the stalls and eventually opted for Asli Satay (Stall 9), since the old Malay man running it seemed personable and pleasantly persuasive. We ordered thirty sticks - ten sticks each of chicken, mutton and beef. These came with the usual peanut dipping sauce, diced compressed rice cakes (ketupat), and sliced onions and cucumber.The pieces of meat were tender, juicy well-marinated and perfectly grilled. The dipping peanut sauce had the right amount of spiciness, nuttiness and sweetness to complement the tasty satay. This was an absolutely delicious satay treat for us. We were very glad to have settled for this stall (Stall 9). Incidentally, Stalls 9 & 10 were both Asli Satay and seemed to be owned by the same people.Having read rave reviews about Stalls 7 and 8 (trading as Best Satay), we then decided to sample ten sticks of chicken satay from Stall 8. Alas, theirs turned out to be a let-down - over-grilled, burnt, hardish and dry. The peanut dipping sauce was bland in comparison
5
Also known as LPS or Telok Ayer Market sits in an historic building amongst the skyscrapers in the Central Business District (CBD). Like other hawker fares, there's a good selection and variety of predominantly Asian food stands. Head outside to the tables along satay row, but only sit there if you're ordering satay, otherwise take a seat inside. The satay sellers in particular actively compete for your business and it can be entertaining watching them one up each other
2
I had read a lot about Lau Pa Sat but felt it was not as authentic as expected. We sat outside to soak in the atmosphere but were smoked out by the grills and ended up with overcooked Satay. one good thing the beer was cold
5
Always go there to eat when I'm free , this is the place I start go when I am secondary student . Now after renovation , the place became more popular , food very tasty and more chair . Must try satay ( at night ) , BBQ seafood and dim sum there
2
We have been there 4 people for a late dinner. They have taken bill from all of us one by one as same amount different people. Be very careful with your order they are trying to rip you off!
4
Try the satay platter which is an assortment of all meats. YOU MUST ORDER THE CHILI CRABS + MANTAO!!
3
This center seemed the most mall-like and homogenized of the hawker centers we visited. Didn't find much that really appealed to us and was only impressed with the quality of food and service at the Korean stall. The seating was clean and plentiful, but the beverage center workers yelled at people and we were disappointed in the variety of dining choices.
4
Lau Pa Sat is a ready-to-eat food market in the city area that takes up roughly an entire city block. Within this, there are a plethora of different types of food and drink stalls with ample tables and seating available for their customers.However, the atmosphere totally changes at night (From 7pm on weekdays and 3pm on weekends) when one of Lau Pa Sat's bordering streets (Boon Tat Rd.) is closed to traffic and becomes the venue for numerous Satay vendors to set up their barbeques and their tables and stools. They sell a variety of different meat (chicken, beef, prawn, mutton, duck, etc. to name but a few) satay skewers from about SG$0.70 each with beer at about SG$5.I found it surreal to be sitting at our table on a warm balmy night in the middle of Boon Tat Rd., looking up and realising we were surrounded by the CBD's office buildings.An experience not-to-be-missed when in Singapore
4
We went here past midnight there are still food stalls open and the place offers foods from different countries . Beers are served too.You can eat Al Fresco or in the covered place. The food is not expensive.The food is delicious. In the afternoon the road beside it is closed and tables are place in the middle of the road to accommodate the people
5
Staying adjacent to Lau Pa Sat, we visited the market and satay stalls on an almost daily basis. The food range is extensive and inexpensive, the atmosphere so much fun. During the day there is a quieter business crowd, but in the evening the place buzzes. We purchased food from a variety of internal stalls over the five days were we in Singapore, and also thoroughly enjoyed the Satay stands outside in Boon Tat Street. If visiting Singapore, Lau Pa Sat is a must
4
we had seen this place on a travel show - and as it was just around the corner from our accomodation, so we decided to give it a go. We wanted the street satay experience and that was what we got. The street outside one of the entrances to the main food centre closes each evening, and out come the tables and chairs. Very basic but alive! The stay vendors seem to go by numbers along the closed part of the street and were saw that numbers 7 and 8 seemed the busiest so we headed to that spot and were ushered to a table very quickly . Lots of food vendors hover around and you just tell them what you want - there is a guy for noodles, and guy for satay and a guy for beer - you just order as you go. They are pretty good at recommending and you don't get ripped off here (unlike boat quay) . You will need the little packets of towels that the old guys come around selling, so the couple of $$ is worth it to wipe hands etc after the messy but yum prawn satays. Im sure this isn't the true 'local" food experience, but it is fun and cheap. It was bustling and full of life and what better than to sit out on a street in the humid air enjoying some delicious food. We had a simple noodle dish as well as the satays and with a few beers , it came to about $60 AUS for two. rough and ready, yes . but jeez it was fun. the food centre itself is filled with all types of different offerings so next time I will be back to try something else. Loved it .
5
Lau Pa Sat Food Centre is close to China Town on Boon-Tat Street. The food is high quality and inexpensive. Boon-Tat Street is closed every late afternoon for vendors to cook marvellous satay meals on charcoal grills, enabling customers to sit and relax on the actual street and enjoy some of the best quality food in Singapore at the best prices.Don't miss this wonderful treat
4
There is quite a wide variety of food here at a good value. The highlight for my colleagues and I was enjoying some great satay in an open air street fair environment. My advice is to get there early before the crowds. We went around 5 PM on a Sunday and the timing was perfect.
4
Wide variety of Indian, Malay, Chinese dishes to suit all tastes - including some western dishes (but why would you!). Very cheap, but excellent quality. Finding a seat can be fun at lunchtime, but just put something down on a chosen spot and it will be there waiting for you when you get your food. Lovely street food in a buzzing environment
5
great Hawker centre, I'd say the best in Singapore!
Great selection of food - my husband and i ate here 3 out of the 5 nights we were in Singapore.
A MUST TRY - the satay!!! It's amazing!!!
4
Excellent range and choice of food. We have been eating at different food markets in Singapore this trip and this place equal to the best. We had the satay sticks at stall 7 & 8. Slightly dearer than we expected when compared to other markets.....but the quality was excellent. Beer comes in a glass as against a bottle. I would prefer a bottle as first glass had perhaps been poured too long and a little warm /flat but next glass ok...really being a bit picky on that perhaps. We would /will eat here again for sure. Throughly recomend you try.
5
I was here with family and friends for lunch. It was like we were spoilt for choices. We had our choice of food from various different asian cuisines.We were full but couldn't stop eating :)We came back in the evening for dinner as well.in the evening the lau pa sat food stalls spill over to the street. With Satay counters giving out mouth watering aromas, tempting you to eat everything from the prawn satays to grilled sting ray, it was the one of the yummiest dinner I had
5
Set at a 120 yr old iconic market, Lau Pa Sat houses some really good but very affordable food. It serves signature Singaporean favorites as well as some international (pizza, pastries, Japanese, and Korean) alternatives all served hawker style. It gets pretty crowded, but it is all worth it.
4
Singapore is full of Food Courts or Hawker Stalls.I love Singapore's Hawker Stalls and the food that they offer. I have been known to manoeuvre a stop over in Singapore, just so I can enjoy its 'street food' offerings.I never eat in restaurants in Singapore, why would you when hawker food is so damn good, so fresh and so cheap?Lau Pa Sat is located in an historical multi-sided pavilion (that was renovated a few years ago. It is now surrounded by office buildings and so gets busy at lunch time. At night time they close off one of the adjacent side streets and turn it into a street full of satay vendors - lots of atmosphere.Apart from the satays (only at night), I don't think that there is anything that particularly stands out with the food offerings. However, it is a beautiful building and worth a visit (and you might as well grab something to eat whilst you there to tide you over to the next hawker stall visit)
4
Boon Tat street south of Lau Pa Sat is shut in the evenings and the street is filled with tables and chairs so you can enjoy the satay and BBQ food from one of the hawker stands that line the streets edge. We were there early and it was pretty quiet, but I’m sure the smoke haze from Indonesia was a contributing factor. The smell of the food cooking over charcoal fires makes your mouth water. We had a satay mixture – chicken, lamb and beef and delicious BBQ prawns, we also ordered cooked greens and indulged in copious quantities of beer (the lady comes around with beer in a jug, fills your glass up and then you pay). This was the only hawker market where the food was bought to our table. It was a fantastic experience and delicious food. There is also other food available
4
This is Singapore's most famous Hawker place, and it deserves a visit. The old food hall structure is still beautiful, the place is well organized and clean, and the selections are terrific. For $20 you can certainly get your fill and choose from many different Asian delicacies. The satay stalls are directly in front of the food hall, so Yu need to step out to order your variety of satay sticks (beef, chicken, pork, shrimp, lamb - stall #7 comes highly recommended, and you don't have to take the large quantities they try to push on you).
4
This place is famous in Singapore, mostly to the younger generation, eventhough this place has quite an old design structure in the middle of tall buildings. But hey, the foods alright, and they got music played too, sometimes the local radio put on the speakers. You can find Indian, Malay, Singapore, Chinese, even some central American food? But most of all, you should try their satay, located outdoor, there's a lot of stall selling satay, most of them taste similar I think. $7 for 10 pcs of chicken satay. Their satay is kinda sweet compared to the satay from Indonesia and Malaysia. Overall enjoy the visit here
5
One great building/venue to stuff a face.Every Asian dish you van imagine (plus more you would never have imagined)A true cornucopia of Asian Ambrosia.Many say it is is a tourist rip off. Maybe/maybe not. No idea what Singapore street food venue/food should be (as a total tourist). But this place was just fine by me (tourist trap or not). Great bustling atmosphere, locals and fellow travellers alike happily troughing away.Loved it
5
This place was recommended to me by a friend and it didn't disappoint. In the peak lunch and dinner times, there are an overwhelming number of people, but it is a fun experience and there is a lot of food choices for everyone! It's just difficult to make a choice with all the options, but great, cheap food
5
Little gem right next to our hotel. Had spicy chicken noodles and fresh pineapple juice
cheap and excellent quality. Made right in front of me so I know that the food was fresh.
Many other outlets in the market as well.
Highly recommended!!!
4
Have been a few times groups of friends. Lots of tasty choices! Bring wet wipes through as there never seems to be napkins anymore!
5
Lovely place to stop and sample local and other cuisines. So much to chose from whether breakfast, lunch or supper. Stopped here a few times and soaked up the atmosphere, the buzz and the delicious smells. Recommend this to you.
5
You want to know where the locals go for their chilli crab and dinner grub- Lau Pa Sat is the place. No frills outdoor dining, this is the best place for you to sample some of the local as well as great SE Asian dishes.

Went there for lunch. You willNotice straightaway that all utensils have the Lau Pa Sat logos. Had the fish head beehoon and chendol. Not bad but not very inspiring either. At $6 a bowl this is definitely about 20%+ dearer than any other hawker centres in Singapore other than the one inside the Changi Airport transit area. Noted that it is not very crowded any time during the day plus 80% of customers are foreign tourists. Good to experience local dishes if you don't know where to find and near Merlion, plus it is an attraction in it's own right but not much more. It has a very sterile or sanitised feel compared with the hustle and bustle of hawker centres that cater primarily for locals. Going there once is enough to make you darting towards places like Maxwell or Old Airport Road where you do meet locals dining
4
It's not difficult to find better satay places than those stands in Lau Pa Sat, but only here you get to eat satay in the middle of dozens of skyscrapers.I've tried most of the stalls (number 1 - 10 or so), and most of them taste very similar
3
A good choice of food from, singaporean (chilli crab too), malaysian, indonesian, thai, chinese, japanese ,korean chile and india.plus a few othersAverage price SGD $5-9. Right in the cbd next to novotel by memory. For the price, portions are smaller by western standards but thats everywhere in singapore.At night they block off Boon Tat street i think it was called and turned it into a smoky haze for the numerous satay vendors to ply their trade. They have spruikers at each vendor boasting the best satay stick ranging from 80-90cents per stick for beef and chicken maybe more for prawns. Tables are everywhere but with the smoke and the heat already in singapore best to sit inside under a fan. And enjoy SGS$5 jugs of local tiger beer. Whilst it was the only hawker centre i went to it was at least a tourist must try- food was ok. the centre isnt hospital clean but long clean tables to eat at which you might end up sharing. I couldnt go past the yum cha stand as it was cheap and tasty by australian standards. and try the local chow kway teo (stir fried rice noodle) . Cute little packaging was a surprise
5
Nestled in the core of Downtown Singapore you will find the Telok Ayer Market also known as Lau Pa Sat. You will be able to dine in the Hawker's centre in the the beautiful historic building. The soaring arches, fretted eaves and slender Victorian columns topped with intricate filigree work, make this a very atmospheric dinning place. This is a great place to try the local Hainanese chicken rice
5
You will find most cuisine here. You will be spoilt for choice and it is really cheap. Open from breakfast to early morning. At night they close down the street on one side and sell satay sticks all night. Down the road from my hotel so I was a regular the whole week. Cash only transactions though so be prepared
4
Went there last month wile I was in Singapore to try out the local Hawker Style food. Was not disappointed at all. The food cooked in the open air was delicious and especially the Sate - beef and chicken ones - prepared and grilled by people in Malaysian dress. It is not the chapest of the Hawker Centers but it is a must when you are in Singapore
5
Recently refurbished hawker centre. Huge selection of food from all over the world available. We went for some Chicken Rice (local specialty). Very reasonably priced.
5
We really enjoyed both the food and the great historic feel of the building. A very wide variety of food. Recommended for all travellers including families.
4
A very local special food stalls in town. The variety of food from bbq wings to dim sum, noodle to Indian pancake. Whatever you want can be found here. The price is a bit high. All are self serve. Best spot for traditional local food.
4
It has the best seafood satay! The place is quite crowded especially in the afternoon. You can find any kind of food in here.
4
Located in the financial area, you might think that you have come to the right place, however, from about 7pm the street is closed off and tables and chairs provide ample space for you to try the variety of street foods available.It's worth taking a wonder around to see what the various stalls have to offer
4
Ate here many times, if you love oriental food ........and I guess you wont be in Singapore if you didnt.......this is the place to go.The hawker stalls are modern and set out like spokes of a wheel in this old victorian building. At the hub is cold deserts and beverages- Tiger can S$4.50 Tiger jug 2 litres S$19.If you want Korean , or Vietnamese - Indian the list goes on.Great Pho Bo at Sunny Vietnamese S$6 or spicy Korean beef for S$4 everything was fresh and tasty. In the evening they shut off one of the streets and it is called Satay Street.....now stay with me.......all the stalls serve ........Satay! We ate at stall 8. Set menu A was 10 beef, 10 chicken and 6 prawns- S$26. Really fresh and tasty.....best satay sauce i have tasted. Top Tip bring some wipes or tissues- or buy them from the street sellers that go round the tables. Tiger beer is served to you at the table by glass or Jug S$19 for 4 glassses. Great atmosphere loads of people and the smell of BBQ and satay.Best place to eat for atmosphere and value and can provide a welcome wallet break from eating in the Marina Bay Sands complex
4
Satay Power Stall all time favourite to get my satay for dinner or supper. Atmosphere great for family n friends gathering. However touting has to stop for some stall. Pestering us to order and even place few menus even before we sit down. Forcing to order from them. (Im not referring to Satay Power Stall,but other stalls.) To tourist or any locals having dinner at Lau Pa Sat choose your stall wisely and check pricing properly to avoid overcharging. My recommendations will be definitely satay,mutton/chicken chop from the Indian stall right at other corner. And drinks i would prefer an Indian guy that will sell drinks alone. Homemade not readymade. His sugar cane,bandung . Rest assured ill come back to same stall each time. No regret. Better than Makansutra Satay 
2
Sadly, Lau Pau Sat has been ruined by the aggressive touts that hang around Satay Street, trying to encourage you to buy expensive 'set' meals rather than getting the great value food directly from the stalls themselves. It's a shame as it really detracts from the experience and I'm disappointed that the authorities have done nothing to reign this in. Every few years I visit Singapore and every time it gets worse. I don't think i'll be going back on my next visit - will have to hunt out a more authentic hawker experience. If you do go, ignore the touts or sit inside rather than at one of the tables on Satay Street
5
We ventured to Lau Pa Sat in search of satays. We emerged from the MRT in the heart of the business centre. We walked through the Hawkers Centre to the most amazing scene of outdoor barbeques and people enjoying the glorious food. We sat at a table and were swiftly served. The waiter helped us to make our selection of lamb, chicken and prawn satays. Whilst we waited we watched the sights and enjoyed the aromas. The prawn satays arrived first, closely followed by the lamb and chicken. They were all delicious but I especially enjoyed the lamb. It was a great experience and one which we thoroughly enjoyed
4
Food in Singapore is really well managed, so don't be afraid to eat in the food centres, and Lau pa sat is one of the best. It's disorganised, and crowded, but worth the effort. Just buy some beers and sates, try some of the other treats on offer. It's a cheap night out but excellent food in a great atmosphere
5
So cool. Went for lunch during the day a meal for five bucks then at nite to satay street . 26 mixed satays for $14. Amazing value. Cold beer. Definitely going back. Fruit and desserts available too
2
I visit this place only because of their satay. Indonesian and Philippine stalls are good too. The rest are very poor. Service staff especially from mainland China are 5 levels below par.
5
Had a great meal here, have a good look round before you choose there's a vast choice of different cuisines. The iron work was cast in Glasgow and shipped over around 1900
5
We've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed! The satay is wonderful and the skate wings so tasty. We always have 1 visit here for our fill of street food and love it. Nice to pay a very reasonable price for Singapore too

The hawker centre at Lau Pa Sat(old market) in the middle of Singapore's CBD is situated in the original wet market building featuring beautiful colonial architecture. The original structure was relocated to this spot at 18 Raffles Quay from the waterfront in 1894 and a stunning clock tower, which still chimes on the hour, was added.Now the building is home to a thriving hawker's centre filled to the brim with stalls featuring cuisines from all over Asia and other parts of the world. Apparently at lunchtime all the local office workers flock to the centre for lunch. Each evening the street in front of the Centre transforms hastily into what is know as Singapore's Satay Street with stall after stall specialising in different styles of satay. The smoke from the charcoal fires fills the air with the it restive bbq aroma of satys cooking and plastic tables and chairs quickly become occupied with diners - locals and tourists alike! A good tip is to sit towards the back of the street away from the cooking fires to avoid rhe smoke getting in your eyes and clothes. Also take wet wipes or extra napkins to avoid getting harassed by passing salespeople. We chose to eat at Stalls #7&8 which comes highly recommended. Table service is provided by waiters attached to each of the stalls. Servings are chosen by the number of sticks of satay and the mix of types you would like. We went for the mix of prawn, chicken, beef and mutton. Menus from other stalls in the hawker's centre are also available so we ordered some rice and klankung to add a bit of green to our dinner.Jugs of cold Tiger beer are $GD20 and the way to go if there are a few of you The satays arrive without fanfare but are some of the most delicious I have tasted. The spice mix on the prawn satays is especially good. The taste of the charcoal grilled meat With a delicious satay sauce is quintessially south-East asia. A great way to get a quick, tasty and atmospheric dinner, in the midst of downtown Singapore, maybe before a visit to some of the amazing rooftop bars like One Altitude nearby
5
Go to stall 7/8 great Satays. Chicken and mutton 70c each. Don't allow the hawkers to bully you in to eating unless you want to eat at that stall. You don't have to buy there packages, buy what you want. Tiger or lime juice finishes it off. the butter chicken was also nice but beware of the whole spices mixed in.Go early if you want a tabl

We were reccomended by our taxi driver to visit Lau Pa Sat to experience good traditional food of Asia/Malaysia and we weren't dissapointed.The building itself is quite colonial looking, with options to sit and eat either inside or outside. On entering you are met with a variety of tastes to choose from. Stalls upon stalls offering Chinese, Indian, Indonesian, Phillipino, Malay, Vegetarian etc. What is nice is if you are in a group you can all choose different types of food and meet in the middle to eat at one of the tables. We both went for one of the Indian Curry stalls and both had different dishes (i went for a lovely Biryani Chicken which fell off the bone on cutting whilst my husband went for the feast of several different currys and Chicken Tikka off the bone) we also went and got a Jug of Tiger (holding around 4-5 pints) Food and Drink came to around the equivalent of Â£15 total!!It is a lovely setting to enjoy the hustle and bustle of Singapore as the locals come and enjoy their evening food and get together s with friends, its set in the heart of the financial district surrounded by the hugely impressive skyscrapers. Highly reccomended, we just wish we'd had more time to sample the different cuisines over multiple evenings
5
The old pavilion that Lau Pa Sat food market is located in is surrounded by the soaring towers of Singapore-- at night, it is stunning to look at, with the market a remnant from another time in one of the most modern cities in the world. In side the building are lots of interesting takeaway stands, with some you wouldn't expect- Costa Rican for instance. The prices are very good, and you don't get hassled by hawkers. Outside are the famous satay stalls- great smells, lots of activity, generating terrific satays. The meat ones are the best-- the big prawns have a bit of a soggy texture which detracts from the great flavour. The beer vendors come to your table with jugs of beer-- $5 a mug is one of the cheaper beers you'll find eating out. Best way to get to the market is from Downtown MRT-- it's about 150 metres. Lau Pa Sat is a must do in Singapore-- you'll love i
4
If you are alone or in a group it's a nice place to eat. Half indoors half outside within the colonial building is a great start into a weekends night out. Prices for SIN extremely low. Food great. Never had a diorreah or similar after this food. I really recommend the plac
4
Fantastic food court serving fare from SE Asia and beyond. The choice is bewildering and the quality of the food is superb. The market has a real buzz and always seems to be busy. Must be a real boon for the thousands of office workers who work in the area. I'd definitely recommend it as an experience. As an aside, Boon Tat St on the western side of the food hall closes in the evening and becomes the seated eating area for the numerous satay stalls which ply their trade - another thing worth trying!!
5
I tried a few satay hawker stalls in Singapore and this was the best, but none were bad. The atmosphere at night with the closed street and hundreds of people is great
4
Street by day market by night. Wide variety of satays, curries and other street food. Can be busy in evenings need to get a table early. Reasonably priced. A great way to spend an evening in Singapore
5
Oldest hawkers food center in Singapore ! Don't miss and love the hawkers food, like chicken rice, satay, coconut....
5
Market style food. Fun, chaotic environment with wonderful fresh
Food choices - food to suit every need and culture. Very cheap. A must experience.
5
I had a great time eating international food! They have great Laksa, chicken, different satay... Chicken, Beef and Pork! Plus off-course the Sting Ray! Good food with great friends and fellowship... Awesome time!
4
the seafood really nice,i choose chili crab,mussels,kangkong sambal and sting ray for only 79 sing dollar.cheap and tasty compare to seafood resto.but you have to bring wet tissue coz they dont give you water or wet tissue to clean your hands.
4
This place is super. So many choices under one roof and such a bargain. My boyfriend and I were really pleased to find both vegetarian food for me and Indian curry for him and all for a great price about 7SGD each. Really close to the main marina area. We had been at Gardens by the Bay for most of the day and it was a great place to stop off at before heading home via MTR. Well worth a visit when you get hungry around this area
5
Great place & great fun to eat here, sure sometimes the satay is overcooked & a bit burnt, but it's so good to sit in the middle of the & eat.there is the Hawker centre right next to the street so there is also plenty of other types of food availiable
3
We went to the night time sitting of Lau Pa Sat, and you need to get there fairly early to get a table outside.I had a mix of chicken and beef skewers and my friend had prawn from Rahimi, and she also got a pork dumpling from a stall inside.I liked the chicken although the beef satay sticks were the best. My friend didn't end up eating the dumpling because she said it wasn't nice, and she said the prawns were tasteless. The prawns were also difficult to eat because they still had their shell on the skewer.All in all, it was ok, chicken and beef satay sticks at $.70 each and the prawns at $2 each, and they encourage you to buy 5 sticks at a time.Tried it once, don't need to try it again
5
This place was amazing. The architecture is beautiful and really adds to the atmosphere. We tried 4 different stalls and none of them disappointed. It was busy but we were still able to find a space and eat and it seemed clean. We tried a satay stall outside-divine, but slightly manic way of serving!2 Thai stalls which were lush, although not spicy enough for me and an Indian stall- the food was served on a piece of baking paper on your tray. The food was lush. We'd been to Maxwell Road food centre and left as we felt it was very dirty. This place was fab. Fab food at a really good price. Don't forget your wet wipes
4
You can eat authentic food at this wonderful hawker's market which has just been renovated. I had the satay, and some Indian, and new to the market, the South American Chicken rice was brilliant.
5
I can only recommend this hawker. The food is nice and the Hawker looks really cool. The only thing is you will not have an AC there.
2
Sorry but this filthy over-crowded excuse for a Hawker Centre is not very appetising at all.The only nice thing was the sugar cane juice & ask for it without ice.Hot humid, dark & dingy side street.Very poor quality meat- god knows what animal it is?And it's not cheap.Long gone are the famous clean Hawker Centres with proper Chicken Satay- small bites that are well cooked.Only worth it for people watching
5
This is where the locals eat. At 7pm, the street is closed off and more tables and chairs set up. We had the chilli crab and black pepper crab and both were excellent. No fancy trimmings - just great food. Take wet ones and don't wear white - you're going to make a mess. Expect to spent $40 - $50 for a crab depending on the size. You choose the crab you want and then it is killed and cooked.
4
This time i stayed at the satay street. Friends of mine told the taxi driver they are using for the last 2 weeks about Satay street.So his advice is to go to Rahim Satay stall NO.3-4.And stay with the meat.(no duck or prawns) .We tried the chicken and beef(my friends don't like to experiment with food)The Satay is really good. Be careful when you order a jar of beer with the ladies walking around. Order with one person and don't be persuaded to order to much.Something to do when you're in Singapore
4
we wanted our Australian visitors to experience street dinning and they were not disappointed. The place is a must for all visitors to singapore and the experience of street dinning is something they must have on their bucket list. The variety is endless and every taste is catered for
4
We went to have satay and recreate a dinner date my wife and I had nearly 20 years ago in Singapore when a similar venue was the satay club. Settle in upwind and enjoy satay and a beer, take some wet ones or buy from a seller at $2 a packet, you'll need them. Food will be about $20 for a good serving and beer $5, we did miss the big bowl of cold cucumber you used to get though, opens at 7pm. Afterwards stroll down to the harbour and have a look
3
Food is OK, beer cheaper than hotels but nowhere near the same price as a neighbourhood hawker centre, where the food also tends to be much better value. Toilets were described by my wife as "the worst in Singapore" when we popped in yesterday. It's a shame - when it was called Telok Ayer before "upgrading" it was much nicer
5
A ate dinner a couple of times at the Lau Pa Sat during my stay in Singapore. The place is very relaxed. You have everything from Vegetarian, Chinese, Indian, Authentic Singapore dishes, Malay, Japanese, Phillipine, Bangladeshi, and many more, even Burgers and pastries . I developed the habit of always taking some cupcakes with me back to the Hotel.Lau Pa Sat is very cheap. If you have to keep an eye on your expenses, this is the right place to go. It is for everyone, even your kids will love it.And for Beer lovers, beer is very expensive in Singapore. This was the only location with reasonable prices for beer in Singapore
5
If your are in Singapore and want to try some of Singapore's best Satay this is the place to go. Its a far cry from the stall that Singapore used to have selling satay in the streets. There is also a lot a choice foods from all over the world can be found here to try. It is definitely worth a visit and very cheap and clean
3
Food are ok..nothing special. But drink stall uncle / auntie are rude..I saw uncle at teh tarik drink stall scold customers, just because miscommunication arose while she ordered drink...I just felt that it shouldnt happen as they are tourist. The attitude can give bad image
5
Big place with a big variation of food. Here you can choose whatever you feel like to have. Dim Sum, Rice, Japanese, Chinese, Traditional dishes, desserts, Indian; whaterver you want! Take a turn into this place - hungry or not!!
5
If you have a craving for satays then there is only one place to go to at night... Satay StreetThe food stalls there are fantastic and the atmosphere electric and the prices are cheapDon't like satays, no problem. Go inside to the various food stalls and choose a meal from ther
4
We were a family group of six adults, one in a wheelchair with a broken foot. We found we were able to manoeuvre the wheelchair from the taxi to a table no worries.This is a fun, busy place. I think kids would love it. Basic tables and chairs no napkins. Take tissues or wet wipes this is messy eating!Very tasty, especially the satay sticks. Lots of locals having dinner; authentic flavours, my husband says he can still taste the prawns
5
I love food in Singapore and what better place than Lau Pa Sat to taste a variety of authentic, local food at cheap prices. The variety is mind boggling and the satay street and the kopitiams right across the road at night make for a brilliant food experience if you're visiting Singapore. Please bear in mind that you will need to have cash. Nobody in Lau Pa Sat (or in other hawker centers in Singapore) accepts cards
5
This is a food court, not a restaurant nor a dining oasis. Do not expect wait-staff, silverware, cushy seats, classy ambience or air-conditioning. There are basic tables & chairs, plastic utensils, ceiling fans, and the sights & sounds & smells of food being cooked. The health & cleanliness is strictly monitored & enforced by government agencies & all hygienic complaints are taken very seriously.I don't know how many actual "stalls" there are here but if all the food-dishes were counted, it would easily number in the hundreds. You only need to browse each vendor's pictured dishes (prices listed) & point to your choices. A typical meal is usually less than $10/person. Cold drinks, fresh fruit, juices from fresh-squeezed fruit. Food available "to go" (take-out)In the evening, the street is blocked off (traffic diverted) and additional seating set up for diners, where "competing" satay vendors furiously fan hot coals to keep up with the orders. Some stalls open in the morning to serve breakfast; some stay open till midnight or later
2
Expensive hawker food of mediocre quality.Crowded, a lot of variety, but for all the dishes we tried (satay, fried hokkien mee, prawn noodle, grill fish), they were all just mediocre, the best dish was probably the fried oyster egg.Food Opera in Ion beats this place anytime. Not coming again
4
Lau Pa Sat is situated right next to Cross Street, near Telok Ayer subway station (address: 18 Raffles Quay). It’s also in walking distance if you’re in Chinatown. A favorite haunt of expats and tourist alike. Housed in a heritage-listed building, this vast hawker centre s host more than 100 different stalls of multicultural cuisine each specializing in one thing. But if you are looking for the most typical and enjoyable dish for your trip in Singapore, it is hard to look past Chilli Crab. Basically, Chilli Crab is a seafood dish in which stir-fried crab is coated with sweet, savoury and spicy tomato based sauce. This Singaporean iconic seafood dish is a must try for any traveler. But there’s more than just the chilli crab. Black pepper crab and butter crab are also delicious alternatives.I had here a succulent red chili crab for 40 sgd
5
Been here a few times to eat, trying different specialities each time and I have never been disappointed with the quality of food! the best time to head to Lau pa sat is from 7pm onwards this is when the atmosphere is at its best. If you enjoy satay they close off a while street and serve up some of the best satay around!
4
We arrived for an early dinner and saw the stall holders setting up on the street. Soon the air filled with the delicious smokey scent of satay sticks cooking.Not long after that the street filled with and luckily we had easily found a table to base ourselves on and ordered an array of satay sticks.We also ordered chicken rice and found it was nicer than the one at Newton Market. Enjoyed by all the family, including 7 year old daughter
5
You can find everything here, this market hidden among skyscrapers offers a wide selection of (mostly) asian food.
5
The sights, the sounds and tastes of street food at its best.
Satay's of all variety along with Indian, Malay and Singporean food.
Great on a budget
4
Have eat here several times on my way to home. Nice crowdy food center in central business area. Quite pricey compared with other food centers in city. A lot of choices of good fresh food.
Nice for chit chat after long work day.
5
For lunch all the office people stream in here like ants :-)When the sun is down and offices closed - part of the street is converted to dining area with open barbecues etc.You can get all kinds of food here served from the variety of stalls at the table you choose.The Lau Pa Sat pavilion itself is very extraordinary - having survived with the highrise office buildings all around ..........A must for local dining in Singapor
4
We wanted to experience a 'hawker center' and this came recommended. It was nice with huge selection of things to eat. Some of us had better experience than others. All in all a good experience if you want to mingle with locals. But it doesnt get hot and crowded during the day
5
This was an amazing place to eat with food from all over Asia on offer, Balinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Mayasian, Chinese, Thai and tons more. Wide choice for vegetarians to pork blood sausages for the meat eaters. There was even a version of fish and chips although the fish on offer that day was swordfish. Loved this place, there was a real buzz to it and found prices more than reasonable. If you want noodles or rice with curried vegetables and a modest dessert, price comes at under 10 SD. Freshly squeezed fruit juice on offer and an abundant variety of fruit and other desserts available. Deffo worth a visit
5
We ate here 4 out of 5 evenings. They close the road at the front and sell satay which is out of this world. You get beef, lamb chicken and the biggest prawns amazing, a large plate for 2 is $24. I enjoyed the Indian food but some of the other stalls were quiet average
1
the place wil be consider cheap for rich tourists but not that great once you have tried other satay places in town... a piece of advice , stay away from stall number 9 as it has the most rude staff in that area. a simple asking of extra sauce and you will be given a sharp look and will tell you "thats not how to eat satay and if people will keep asking for extra sauce.....". it snaps my patience and didnt let him finish his sermon and told him if you want to charge for extra sauce go ahead, im here to eat and not to hear a sermon
5
Had such a great night here tonight. Started off outside with chicken satay sticks and $5 mug of Tiger beer. Decided to move inside to try something else and couldn't go past the Indian Classic Cuisine A5 stall. We had the Naan Set for $7 with various meat and vege choices to choose from. This was the BEST Indian food I have ever eaten, although I am weak to spices it certainly still delivers in taste and quality. From a couple of well travelled Aussies who love a good eat, Lau Pa Sat and especially the Indian stall cannot be missed if you come to Singapore!
4
Apparently skewers use to cost 60c each but we found it to be a set menu with each skewer being 1 dollar, still cheap, the meat ones were a bit small but I suppose that gets them cooked quickly. The prawns were nice and big, all with an amazing satay sauce too. Attentive service, you can get all kinds of food in the same place, 5 bucks for a tiger beer and 2 bucks for a coke, definitely a cool experience to try, and only 10 minutes from the marina. We were trying to budget as it was our last evening but ended up having to get another 50 dollars out as that is what the cash machines in the area had, so unless your buying a huge skewer platter remember to bring enough dosh!
5
More expensive than it used to be. Great place to sit outside with a cold jug of Tiger and have satay. Location makes is so good. Sat outside looking up at the skyscrapers in the heart of the city.
4
Satay and Beer after a long hot day is nice here. Although, the price of Satay is for tourists at night. But was delicious.
4
Food here is awesome, tried a different stall every night for dinner and wasn't disappointed with any of the meals. If you like satay - try stall 7/8 for lovely satay sticks
4
Must try: Seng Kee Hokien Mee and Fried Oyster Omelet
Satay Stall 7 and 8.
Better if you bring your own drinks and tissue as both are expensive here.
4
Love the satay there! Always ordered from stall number 6. People say all the satays taste the same there but no! There is a difference. But please be prepared to be sweaty and smelly for the smoke!
4
Plenty of choice so go on an empty stomach!!! U got stalls inside selling various cuisines then the street outside selling satay. However do be aware when ordering satay we got the smallest set for two pax and there were lotssss and lotsss of satay. We couldnt finish it. Was pricey also at 35 dollars!!!
4
At 7pm every evening, the street between the Sofitel So Hotel (Robinson Street) and Lau Pa Sat is closed off and becomes a food mall. The satay stalls are set up and the smell of delicious food wafts along the street. Inside the market you will also find a variety of foods like Singaporian, Indian, Chinese, vegetarian, Italian, noodles, rice, juices, desserts, etc. You could eat there every day and still find something different. Cheap and cheerful and you can sit either inside or outside enjoying a satay and beer while watching the world go by
3
Went here to relieve my time I spent in Singapore about 10 years back and unfortunately the old Satay Club moved some of it's stalls to this location. I have to say I'm not really impressed with the quality of the Satay and other items such as Fried Rice and Char Kway Teo, It was the usual hustle and bustle. Worth the visit if you are tourist but much better places for local food
3
We made the mistake of coming here on a Sunday afternoon. Maybe some might say that since this is the CBD area, it's to be expected that more than half the stalls would be shut on a weekend. That said, it is one of the more famous tourist attractions in Singapore! We were rather disappointed. Still managed to enjoy the building, but it really lacked the atmosphere
4
You get what you pay for! This place is awesome for having so many choices to peruse, but I found the quality lacking a bit. Everything is pretty good, but nothing really stands out like in a real restaurant, or so I felt.Everything is also so streamlined to provide you with the food quickly. A great place to go to though for the real hawker centre experience! A cab driver suggested this on as the one locals go to.I didn't like that most of the restaurants inside weren't open at certain times of the day. The building I think is open 24 hours but not the individual stalls. Before lunch (11 am) and maybe around 3-4 it is pretty quiet. Not sure the exact hours when stalls are closed.
5
Not just because of the variety of authentic mouth-watering food stalls, but it's because of the unforgettable culinary experience! Prepare your belly everybody! :)
5
love this classic, comfy place. you can sit for long and won't be bored. in fact you'll forget what time it is and how long have you been sitting there. lots of options available, too.
2
Although the exterior looks really beautiful after a major renovation, the price of the food also went up as the vendors are now managed by third party vendor - Kopitiam. Recommend to go other hawker centres for better food at a lower price.
4
Awesome Satay here, had the chicken beef and prawn combo from "Best Satay" out the back. Great atmosphere, was very hot but enjoyable. A few beers as well and the rest of the table enjoyed their meals. I recommend anyone visiting Singapore to eat here for a meal and experience it.
3
Ok for a bite to eat if you are in the area,plenty of stalls to choose from,Chinese,Indian,Vietnamese etc also some Western style food stalls.Lunchtime it gets very busy with the local workers so avoid this time,unless you dont mind crowds and waiting for food or a table.Food is reasonably priced and the portions are good sized but I have eaten better at other food courts

Lau Pa Sat a place for eating some of the tastiest food around.Lau Pa Sat is over a hundred years old and will keep going for ever.There are so many varieties of dishes From seafood ,with the incredibly large prawns,to satay cooked on open bbq style grills.The smells of all this food wafts over you dragging you every which way,but no matter where you stop the food is gooood.Plus it is really inexpensive,even the beer is only S$10 a mug.There is another place similar to this called Newton's Circus,just ask anyone and they will point you the way...my mouth is watering
1
Most tourists head to this place to sample 'authentic ' local cuisine. As a local, i am sad to say but this is not a proper representation of our local cuisine. First of all, the cooks are not of singaporean origin, mostly hired by franchises at a low price to cook food which is not really up to standard. Secondly, the stalls all sell the same food, fishball noodles, satay, all have more than one store. If you're looking for local food look elsewhere
2
Strongly advised to not order the Char Kuay Teow if possible. Affordable food. There must be better alternatives compared to the 1 dish I had ordered. Clean area.Natural warm temperature of Singapore. Pavillion-style layout. Lots of repetitive types of stalls.Opinion may improve if I tried some other dish
5
Decided to walk to Lau Pa Sat whilst waiting to check in to our hotel and WOW the variety of food, prices, quality and atmosphere was amazing.We managed to get a filling meal from different food stalls for under S$15 for two people. (Mi goreng, pork buns, steamed prawn dumplings and spring rolls) Remember to bring a packet of tissues along to place on the table to reserve it
5
Mum and I found this place to be great. We hit lunchtime so very, very busy...tip: make sure you have a little bag of tissues to reserve a seat. This is the way reserving seats are done and it is well respected. Our meals including a drink was approx $6....value for mone
5
Good cheap eats with cuisine from Singapore and more. Come dusk, the main road shuts to traffic and more stalls come to life! Must try the infamous satay!!
2
satay ok but other food is poor quality and overpriced but popular with foreign tourists as food sold out by 10 pm
4
Wide variety of Asian foods, all freshly made to order. Desert available. New stall opening soon. Roof fans help with cooling.
5
As a satay liver I was in heaven here....so many great satay stalls & food stalls in general. If you can't find anything to eat here that you like I'd be very surprised. Queue with the locals for the best foods & deals.
4
We went here as we wanted to try the local street food in Singapore. Tried local beer and chicken and Prawn satays which are famous here. They were unique in taste.There is a minimum order of 30 sticks in all the stalls. So had a filling dinner here. Then we had Ice Kachang a local dessert which was quite good. All in all a good place with good cheap food. Cleanliness can take a hit if you compare the city as a whole. I would recommend thi
4
After a number of trips to Singapore we promised ourselves to finally get to Lau Pa Sat and well its nothing to special. Lots of different eateries demanding your attention with Hawkers gathering business. We had chicken to start as we arrived 1 hour before the Satay Hawkers starting cooking like I keep saying nothing to special. We order our Satay sticks from one vendor and yep nothing to special. In fact I had better at Gluttons Bay. We I go again NO. I will stick to Gluttons by the Marina Bay
4
Fight off the touters as you enter the satay-arena and make a beeline for Satay 6-7 Good value to be had in the combo 6 x prawn/10 x chicken/10 x beef satay @ $S24 and washed down with a jug of Tiger draft beer @ $S19If still hungry go the spicy fried rice @ $s4 or Banana Murtabak @ $S
3
Quite expensive and not the kind of hawker i had imagined it to be. The place has different stalls with food choices not only native to sg but also from other countries. The food was great though, with varieties. Recommended: cereal prawns, chicken & beef satay, mutton biryani, ice kachang and water chestnut for drink.
5
The street markets here of a night are set up in the street outside the Sofitel SO and are masters at Satay Sticks. The drinks are cheap and the meals available are just as cheap. Even though this place is open 24hrs, the street is only closed at night and the place comes alive
3
We tried multiple hawker markets in Singapore...Maxwell, Newton, Lau Pa Sat, Gluttons Bay. Unfortunately we did not come to this one at the right time. We got there at 12 pm after reading they have a great lunch crowd. Even when we left around 1:00, most stalls were still closed. They do offer more western fares for those travelers with kids that do not want to try or continue eating all the local fare. For instance, they have a pizza/chicken nugget and fry place. The vietnamese stall had great pho. And we tried the chicken rice at the "chicky" stall which I compared to the famous tian tian stall at Maxwell. I thought it was just as good. The place was empty at lunch and I wish we had gone in the evening. It seemed more modern and clean than Maxwell hawker center. However, it ranked third for me, with Newton food centre being first
2
No more a hawker market. Price is very high now, likely serve tourist only. Not worth to go anymore.
I just been there is a ice much sour orange juicy cost me S3!! What the hell??
4
A great way to experience hawker markets in Singapore, highly recommend Satay 7 & 8. Busy but worth it to escape the expensive restaurants.
1
Too much touting; a real turn-off. Worse of all, the touts turn rude when your brush them off. the real bad experience was at the so-called famous satay street. Frankly speaking, it is way over-hyped and over-priced. It is just another tourist trap.
4
Loved the food here.....satay and bbq tiger prawns....fish cakes...noodles and rice....alll amazing...great sitvout market feel....quick service walking distance from raffles place mrt. Or merlion park. Must trybat night.
4
We loved the variety we got when we visited the food court. The food was very tasty and worth the visit. Would love to go again.
5
Fab atmosphere, friendly and vibrant. Enjoyed a great mix of chicken, beef and lamb skewers washed down with a pint of tiger beer. Loved the fact you can order from any stall and still sit on the middle of road and eat together, would highly recommend for the experience and wonder around the delights of all the food stalls as much as the food
4
Since the refurbishment locals may be put off this food court as the bigger chain eating stalls are here now, however for a visitor to singapore it is still a interesting thing to do to dine out on satays/chilli stingray sitting in the st. There are lots of other food options from India, Chinese, Malay to western inside at the individual food stalls
4
Get there before 5pm on a Sunday and watch them set up for the night. We went two times the first for the sate which was great. The next time for some naan which was served with a curry sauce. The naan was ok but the curry sauce was not
4
Was staying in the neighborhood on business and ate here for breakfast lunch and dinner regularly. The satay at night is fun as well! I didn't have anything that wasn't delicious and there is even a juice bar in the center that will make fresh juice, which hits the spot on a hot day. Laksa, Indian, Chicken rice, noddles bowls galore...everything it good. Just make sure you bring cash...it's all cash only, not that you need much. Most things are $3-$5...unless you want a lot of food, the max I saw was around $10 for a stall and $30 for satay
4
This food court has everything for everybody. And to top it they have a street closed off where you can sit down and eat from different stands saté.If you just go for the saté,just have a look around and try the place where the most locals are sitting. Or just try a few places. The place where I have been eating I ordered the famous chilly crab,not that great. Probably not the right place and I will try it somewhere else another time.Lau Pesat is a nice place to sit,enjoy the food and look at all the people eating and walk by.Not to expensive, there are cheaper places.All taxi drivers now the place.Just try it
4
A lovely hawker centre to eat at. Many different stalls selling Chinese, Indian, Italian, dishes so many stalls to choose from. Also there is a drinks stall selling juices and Tiger beer. A must visit place.
4
good food, nice place to hang out with friends, open around 6-7pm, famous for their satay ( duck satay )
3
Had the Hokies noodles, fried carrot cake (white), chicken and beef satay. Everything is just average...have eaten better in Newton circus.
4
Restored open hexagonal pavilion worth a visit, great variety of food and not as expensive as expected given its location in the financial district, seemingly primarily populated with
5
First time here, highly recommended by friends and they are right! Great Satay!!!! Love the peanuts souce! Tried the mixed satay! Reasonable price. Great food selection inside and we will be back! The red shirts Staff for satay is the one recommended by our friends and they are friendly and good satay! Thank you guys! We will be back
5
Have followed these street food hawkers from 20 odd years ago before the government shifted them to Lau pa sat area, at 7pm the street next to the food hall area closes to traffic and out come the satay stalls and table and chairs set up on the road way, best satays in Singapore, my husband and I had beef and chicken peanut satays, fried rice and Singapore noodles and a jug of beer, was to die for, highly reccommend, it gets very busy very quickly so if you are hungry and dont want to wait for a table to be free, get there just before 7pm. Cant wait to go back
4
Dropped by here for dinner one evening and was not disappointed at all. Look for where the locals are eating and don't get pushed into having a meal somewhere. The proof of the pudding is where the locals eat. If there is a queue for the tucker, then it must be good.Got two main courses for less than $10 and drink prices were reasonable; they have to eat and make a quid too. Besides, we are there on holiday. Chill out. Will always come back for a quick meal
5
A must-visit in Singapore if you want to try hawker food this city is famous for. So many food choices from former street hawkers that were moved by the government into this new building. Great place to try Singaporean food. At night the street next to the building is closed to traffic and transformed into an outdoor eating area with tables and chairs. Satay is the main dish served here but you can still order other dishes from the restaurants next door. Absolutely enjoyed that evening
4
We were recommended to eat at this place whilst we were staying at Marina Bay Sands. We decided to make the trip (only fifteen mins or so walk) and were totally glad we did...on the more than one occasion we did! The food was excellent as was the choice. It's also in a lovely building. Would totally recommend.
5
What an amazing atmosphere this was to experience! There was so much variety of food (which we most definitely took advantage of!) but the real hero was certainly those satay sticks!!!! Absolutely amazing and so quick from when we ordered to when we received them. This is a MUST when in Singapore
4
We were staying across the road at Sofitel and went there for dinner. Good atmosphere, good and cheap Food.
3
We went here at lunch time and was a little disappointing considering all the great reviews. Probably better to go at night when the Satay is on.
4
This hawker centre is housed in an historic old building with lots of ambience.
A wide selection of food types from various countries are available to choose from.
If hawker style dining appeals to you this is a place to try.
4
the satay club is something we do every time we go to s/pore.prices are reasonable & for 4 people we spent $100 including drinks.unfortunately the satay club has to share toilets with lau pasat and these amenities would have been the worse we have ever had to use. Considering lau pasat has only just been refurbished we expected a higher standar
5
Difficult to say which was our favourite dish as they were all very good. Indian, Japanese as well as Singapore staples were all excellent and very cheap. No wonder locals eat there often. Some stalls were crowded but worth waitng for a table spot as they are ususally the best. Highly recommended
4
This is a great place in the business district area and easy to get to.The selection is wide and you will likely find something that fancies you. The price is of course a little pricier since it is in such a central location but it is not overpriced like Newton Food Center. There are also alot of local office workers eating there. The food center is in an old remodeled market (the name in chinese) and it is bright, clean and airy
5
We decided to visit Lau Pa Sat after reading the reviews. We caught the train which was easy, quick and cheap! Felt a bit overwhelmed when we first entered the centre as it was so big and busy! We didn't know what to choose!! After doing a few laps I ordered a Laksa and my husband ordered a Hokkien Noodle dish. We really enjoyed ourselves, the food was great, it was cheap and plentiful. It was fun to people watch and look at the large varieties of food on offer. Will definitely visit again if we are lucky enough to return to Singapore
4
There's a few tricks to this place. One is go after dark for the best feel and sense of authenticity to the experience. Another is order the sate from the sate stall in areas 6/7. The last is, keep in mind where you are and what Lau Pa Sat is all about. This is not a fancy restaurant, with table cloths, heavy silverware and fine china. This is traditional street food and as that it's very good. I ordered stingray, and beef and chicken sate. Washed down with some Tiger beer, this is a fun night out, all the more so with its relaxed nature and great prices. There's a terrific sense of informality and the food comes in a flurry. It's tasty and very moorish. Enjoy and go with the flow. It's all great fun and good food.

Visiting the hawker centres in singapore is an wonderful gastronomic experience. Our hotel was 3 bus stops away from lau pa sat and hence visited it a couple of times. The architecture of the place is amazing and it is the huge huge fans which keep the place cool in the evenings. Am not sure if it would be as comfortable in the afternoons .In any case visiting for dinner is an awesome experience as you get to sample the satays on the adjoining boon la street which is closed to traffic after 7 pm every day and becomes a satay lane . There are hordes of people relishing the satay with beer and just being on this street is a unique experience. The prawn satays are for 2 $ each and the chicken & mutton satays for 0.70 each. Stall number 7 & 8 are the ones known to have the best sataysThe food in the hawker centre is amazing too and you will surely be spoilt for choice. There are local food stalls , stalls serving western , Indonesian, Malaysian, indian and even Costa Rican food. As in other hawker centres and food malls there are stalls exclusively devoted to drinks ,juices and dessertAll in all a lovely experience. Go there in d evenings ..
4
Hawker Centre (outdoor food court) that's a historic landmark with wide array of cuisines to choose from. They have fans but no air con since it's outdoors. Do not sit next to a stall that steams its food or you will feel like you're sitting in a sauna. I liked the tea rice; my dad ordered everything he could get his hands on: chicken rice, fried oysters, kway teow, gai-lan and more
5
I was with a local so that helped. Satay is the classis dish so you can't go wrong with that, similarly the Tiger beer. A great mix of locals, ex pats and tourists
4
Best arrive before 8:30 although a few shops open till very late at night.
My choice would be Malaysian food and Indian.
4
there are some satay stands right in front of this amazing food court. you have to try them! really delicious food. i went there the fifth time now and everytime was worth it!
5
There's so much to choose from! The food and atmosphere is great! Prices are good and gives you a good introduction to local food.
5
Came here on May 3rd. Was starving from a playful day in USS. Really2 impressed by the selection of food although some stalls already close by the time we get there around 7pm. This place has a very high ceiling and lots of jumbo fan. For the price it's slightly more expensive than any other food centre but it's still make sense price in Singapore. If you come at night, make sure you try their satay of course accompany by tiger beer it's a very good meal to close your day.
5
This place is the Ultimate for awesome Singapore Satay, went there on one night and was hooked, went back every night that we were in Singapore, Fantastic food, from Satay to the ever popular Singapore Chilli Crab, La-La, and Noodles, don't do this...you're nuts. All washed down with cold Tiger Beer, pure bliss
4
Not necessarily a traditional hawker market but still a great stop to taste the full variety of Singapore tastes. I am partial to the satay vendors who are outside the main building. There are several options of vendors, all of which will try to get you to come to theirs. I have been to "best satay stall 7&8" and it was very good. I haven't don't a proper taste test of the others but that could be an idea for next time! FYI that they people taking your food order are different than those selling beverages. All good once you know the deal. Worth the stop.
4
We saw an ad for this place on our hotel TV and loved it! It was such a fun experience rather than going to a restaurant or cafe. We went for lunch so not sure what it is like at dinner but I hear its great. Beware it is in the Business Centre area so if you go at lunch time it is very busy but still good and easy to get a seat. Hot Tip: Look for this place with the biggest line!!
4
As a number of previous reviews have observed, this is more of a food court than a hawker market. It is more upmarket than most hawker centres, and more expensive (although still reasonably priced). I note a previous review says it is the oldest food market in Singapore. I can’t comment on the accuracy of this, but if it is then it has been totally rebuilt as it is more modern, better kept and cleaner than others so don’t expect an historical or old fashioned food market. It therefore lacks a bit of the Singaporean ‘hawker centre’ atmosphere, although during the day it’s position adjacent to Raffles Quay and the finance/business district means that it is full of Singaporean office workers smartly attired with collar and tie (and a few in business suits despite the heat) having their lunch, which gives an indication of the type of place it is. Whether it is ‘the best hawker market’ in Singapore depends on your requirements. If you want a more modern, smarter, cleaner and more airy atmosphere with probably slightly better food than other hawkers markets but at slightly higher prices, then this is fine. But it you want a more down to earth local experience then you may prefer one of the others (and if you want a really basic experience in a hot and stuffy atmosphere with very few tourists, then try the Peoples Park indoor centre in Upper Cross Street! As the saying goes, it’s chalk and cheese!
3
IT is a food market the oldest one in Singapore you can ea what you want with the best Price , if BBQ items if Fish items any sweets maybe to dring the best or Turkish Food or Japanan food or any other kind of food this is the place
5
Best thing in Singapore is this food market - wide variety of foods, delicious and well priced. Authentic dishes from Singapore, HK, Japan, India, Malaysia etc. Delicious.
5
Magnificent building, multiple choice cuisine options, great atmosphere. Ever so cost effective. Food we had was fab, basic and it was great to get away from the normal tourist style restaurants. Cheap and great. Could easily eat there multiple times.
3
It's cheap and you'll get a decent feed but really all it is is an open air shopping centre style food court. I had some dumplings which came from a prepackaged, supermarket style frozen pack. I can do that at home! Partner had some noodles and reported that it was good. The food courts around town do a better job I think
4
We walked through the market to the back where several satay stalls were touting for your trade. It is quite a simple set up and we ate from stall 7/8 and the satay were lovely. The tables are basic but the price and service were good. Take your own wipes or buy them from the hawkers doing the rounds
3
Satay from stalls 6, 7/8 is awesome.Those from stall 6 has sliver of fat with each piece of beef, which makes it so fragrant, and tender.Those from stall 7/8 is well done without being overcooked. The meat is tasty, and slides off the satay stick easily.The peanut sauce from 7/8 is better than that from 6, being thicker in its consistency, and there is more peanut. They were also great in giving out complimentary napkins, which is rarely done in Singapore.Beer comes in mugs or jugs, prices are high, but what do you expect in a tourist area.Cautionary note for anyone thinking of getting some BBQ seafood with their satay from the other stalls in the main hawker centre complex. DO NOT BUY from a stall called BBQ seafood facing the street with the satay stalls. Not only are the prices exorbitant, but the portion of the food is so little that it bears no resemblance whatsoever from their pictures. I understand that pictures are meant as reference and most times they look better than actual food served. But this stall takes the cake in misrepresentation. I really wonder how they survive in their business, unless the stream of first timers like us is so high as to be able to sustain them. I wish to spread the message about this stall as I believe they deliberately misrepresented because when the server came with our orders, and we looked disbelievingly at the food, he dared not look at us and basically scurried away.I have been to Lau Pa Sat twice, and the satays from the 2 stalls were always good. The other satay stalls are of average standard
4
Lau Pa Sat is huge (seats 2000), clean, has a great variety of dishes and is relatively cheap. During our visit we ate at quite a few hawker markets but this is the only one we came back to twice. A main meal would set you back between $3 and $5SGD unless you wanted seafood. Every Asian cuisine is covered as well and you can buy lovely fresh fruit and great ice kachangs. This is the best Hawker market in Singapore and well worth a visit
3
I love night markets.. But this was more like a food court. They have a variety of food but the food was really average. We had the bbq seafood place and the satay sticks. The bakery place was expensive and it wasn't good. Stop by the dessert place for a durian milk shaved ice or mango milk shaved ice yummm those saved the day :
5
We had heard a lot about the “street food” in Singapore and were really looking forward to it. Lau Pa Sat was recommended to us by a couple we met in the Shangri La hotel in Sydney earlier in our trip. Thanks John because it certainly lived up to my expectations ! We usually took a seat in the satay area of the cordoned off Boon Tat Street as it was bustlingly busy and loud with chatter. The hawkers then come to you and you make your various selections from their menus. You could of course go into the market itself and just choose something from the dazzling array there is on offer but so many options would leave me undecided for hours . Beer/drinks you purchase from inside the market. We usually opted for mixed satay of beef, lamb and chicken and a noodle dish. The portions are enormous when they come and utterly delicious washed down with a jug of Tiger beer. Great value for money when compared with “restaurant” dining in Singapore but still more expensive than the myriad of kerbside venues where you can often get an enormous sharing platter of mixed dishes for two for 12 Singapore dollars ( about £6 ) or individual dishes for 4 Singapore dollars ( about £2). Some people may be wary of the hawkers gathering round you when you take a seat and in some other cities I would agree ( especially when one of them starts asking questions about your Tag Heuer watch ) but this is Singapore and you are perfectly safe. The hawkers ( while they may be curious about your watch ! ) are invariably polite and respectful and simply trying to earn a living. Some people may also be concerned about the hygiene aspects of eating “street food” but there is absolutely no need to worry when you are in Singapore. Everything is licensed, well regulated and safe there unlike other places in the region. Food styles from all over Asia are available here and it is a fantastic opportunity to try them without being concerned about any after effects. Go and enjoy this dazzling and unique experience. You won’t be disappointed. I know I will be heading straight to Lau Pa Sat as soon as I have checked in to my hotel next time I am in Singapore 
4
If you want to get a taste of local dining, go to Lau Pa Sat. There are a lot of stalls offering different dishes - local, Indian, Chinese, etc. You can grab a table on the street and the servers will come to you with their menus. Just tell them what you want and they will bring you your order in a few minutes. We had satay, cereal prawns, prata, etc. Good value for money
5
If you have not yet been in a hawker place, you must have a meal here. It's a food court with a wide variety of foods, excellent quality for a good price. On the outside you 'll find the satay vendors. Not too miss. You can eat at any table and get food from different vendors, they will bring it to the table. payment is cash
5
When in Singapore, you must try the hawker food. We went to 5 different hawker malls and Lau Pa Sat was easily the best. Amazing Laksa. Everything is so affordable! Just try what looks good!
2
Not really a good experience for me as the the seller will all come to you and make you order & if you don't want to order from their stall. They will says nasty things. No I'll not come back.
4
A place with lots of local food, and taste good.
Please don't go during lunch hour and dinner time, there are no seat for you and very crowded. or maybe you can make yourself earlier to the place and grab a nice seat.
5
This place is an experience. Lots of great stools with stuff not seen other places. A must go on Singapore.
Don't miss the satay outside but avoid the tourist traps.
5
This is a great example of a hawker food centre - a wide variety of food for any time of the day.Our hotel (So Sofitel) was adjacent to Lau Pa Sat. We had fresh fruit juice and cut fruit every morning for about $7. There is a fantastic bakery - look out for their chocolate croissants.Every evening the road is closed and tables erected for Satay - $26 for a plateful of chicken, beef, lamb & prawn. Worth a try
5
We visited this venue 2 years ago and I said I'd never go back. Fairly grotty, with only average food.Saw advertisement in our hotel that said it had been refurbished recently. Thought we would give it another go, on our last night in Singapore. WOW. What an improvement! Really great, very clean, good signage, excellent selection, not too busy even at 7.30pm Saturday evening. After a couple of Tigers, wandered around to make a selection and happened upon the Satay Club in Boon Tat Street at the back of the building. The whole street was blocked off, with stalls, cooking fires and tables and chairs all along the roadway. Chicken, prawns and beef satay sticks with rice and condiments, with a side of seafood fried rice was just fabulous. Pity it was our last night on this trip, as we would definitely have gone again.Thoroughly recommend it. Thoroughly local and thoroughly authentic
5
We ate here on 3 separate occasions over a 10 night holiday and enjoyed every visit.We had satay, chilli crab and kway teoh on each occasion and also had katsu curry and naan breads on different occasions.Very enjoyable and we would happily return next time we're in Singapore. Good value for money too
4
We visited Lau Pa Sat market at around 8:30pm on a Thursday evening. At this time, streets around La Pa Sat market had been cordoned off and stands had put up tables in the street. Our friends proceeded to suggest & order tasty satay, as well as some noodle dishes and Tiger beer. Perfect location for enjoying local foods and having a conversation with friends. Probably not so much recommended for families with small children, as it can be quite crowded
4
This is a great night out in Singapore one of the better hawkers markets and the food selections are fantastic and should please every palate. The only downside is try not to use the toilets they were by far the most disgusting I have seen in Singapore which usually is not a problem, as the amenities are constantly been refreshed in most of the places we have been. It was disappointing as it forced us to leave early. Lau Pa Sat management need to improve their game in this area
4
We'd just arrived in Singapore following a long flight and after checking into our hotel, the hotel porter recommended Lau Pa Sat to us.It is certainly worth a visit for the experience. Lots of stalls and food counters with a huge selection of dishes. We found a table and were quickly served an amazing selection of satay, salads and some Tiger beer.Not inexpensive, but worth a visit
4
Many tasty food choices all under the "hat" of Victorian cast iron arches and filigree trusses set out in an octagonal shape. It is a lovely historic eating place without paying a premium to enjoy it. For example, masala dosai for 3 SGD. Yum. Cheap!
5
位于CBD地带，交通十分便利，我们是在这里享受了下午茶，然后再慢步Marina Bay，十分惬意。而且，这里的店员都十分热情，服务也比其他Local food court要好。
3
Pity the place has beeen refurbished over the years and is now more touristy.
Food choice in abundance... still have the street hawkers selling Stay. good for a tick in the box.
4
Great market place with many food outlets. I would suggest rice dumplings. Sometimes it can be too hot to sit and eat.
5
Just great! This is somewhere that was recommended to us by our taxi driver (and then by just about everyone else we talked to) and we went twice in three days. It is a place that is good for tourists but very popular with locals. There is a bewildering array of food outlets serving a good variety of cuisine types and dishes, although the main foods represented are chinese, indian, korean, seafood and satay, as well as the more acquired taste of pig organ soup... We went once for dinner - great atmosphere - bustling, busy, lively, noisy - and once for lunch (which was on a Sunday and so a quieter affair when not everything was open, but we had more space and time to be able to look around and make our minds up). The toilet facilities and understandably a bit basic and I think everyone takes cash only, but the prices are so reasonable you can pig out (no pun intended) for well under a tenner ($15 US)
4
Hot and smelly, packed and noisy, bare tables and no frills - I love this place. Good for tourists as an introduction to hawker style food but popular with locals too. Cheap food, plenty of variety - you can't really go wrong at any of the stands
4
We went to Lau Pa Sat twice...once during the day to take advantage of some of the venue's various hawker food. Prices are extremely affordable, and the space is very quiet on weekends. Make sure you make a return trip during the evenings, as the street outside is blocked off and filled with traditional hawker stands serving up seafood and skewers at very reasonable prices. The seafood stalls at Lau Pa Sat around the perimeter remain open during the evening hours, but I believe the inside stalls close down at an earlier time.Definitely worth checking out
4
Hello Guys, If you're in singapore and If you're looking for big range of different types of food to try? Here's the place which called Lau Pa Sat which just nearby from the MRT Interchange Raffles Place Station. It takes around 10mins by walk from there. It always get busy in Breakfast and Lunch time Because all the working staff get back here to take their Meal. Don't ever forget to try Chinese Rice Bowls. ;) Hope you enjoy your food. Happy Trave
5
I can't even tell you how delicious this Laksa was. My Malaysian friend made me promise to get some malay food and so we stopped in specifically to try some. The Lakso was so good I don't ever need to eat another thing in my life. I'm going to have to find a recipe when we get home.
5
What a place ..my mouth waters at the mention of LAU PA SAT. This is a Singapore landmark - and a must visit for food lovers. Lau Pa Sat is conveniently located in the heart of the city's Central Business District - very close to Raffles MRT station. This is a food court with a difference where traditional hawkers cook their ware in small stalls. As you walk towards this outdoor dining food court with a difference, the irresistible satay aroma of barbecue smoke welcomes you. The place is known for their delicious sizzling satays with yummy peanut sauce.A mug of chilled beer makes the combo truly deadly!!! You can have your pick of satay skewers of chicken, lamb, beef , pork and even sea food. But I liked the lamb the best. At night as the place fills up, the bustling atmosphere is a true reflection of Singapore's night "food" life

We ate at Stall No.7. The food was terriable. The vegi was very very salty; the clams were 80% un-opened(dead); the pawns were not fresh; the sati were dry and over cooked. Overall a bed experance.
5
Ate some satay and garlic oysters outside, which were amazing. Then ventured inside to thoroughly stuff myself with a pork bau and some dim sum. All this around 10pm. Except for the Singapore prices, it was great!

First night in singapore after a long flight, we were lucky to have Lau Pa Say within walking distance from the hotel. The "Satay street" area is definitely the highlight - delicious food, busy, bustling atmosphere and the smell of charcoal and smoke filling the air. Grab a table and be served satays, beer and other options without even leaving your seat! Very clean and well organised. We had a $500 dinner at a high-end restaurant the next night but I'll remember satays at Lau Pa Sat much more fondly

We visited Lau Pa Sat on New Years Eve and as you can imagine it was very busy. There is lots of action and literally hundreds of stalls to buy your food from. Would recommend trying bits and pieces from various stalls, as the quality varies, as you would expect. The katsu curry don we bought was a hit. The hainanese chicken rice was not. The best part is the ambience, there are so many different hawkers yelling and buzzing around, the aromas and sights are delicious and interesting. Come prepared to to try many different things and be prepared to leave your comfort zone if you want, or stick with traditional favourites.Fair warning, however, as other reviews have mentioned, in the notoriously clean Singapore, the toilets are putriiiid. They should be avoided.Nonetheless, enjoy

We enjoyed an evening dinner at Lau Pa Sat. We felt like a local eating outside under the stars. We had a variety of satay (chicken, lamb, beef and shrimp). The shrimp was overcooked and mushy but the rest of the meat was fantastic. We also had a pitcher of Tiger beer for $20. Additionally, we had some kind of stuffed bread which was fantastic as well. They don't have napkins but no worries someone will come along and sell you a package of tissues and wet wipes for $2
5
Remember, know the place your ordered from. Satay. There's so many restaurants that serve this dish. Many wait staff will walk up to you to see you their combos. There's room to negotiate. remember. They only accept CASH! Wish I could spend more time to try more places in Lau Pa Sat. Definitely recommend the Indian place right across from Wendys. Don't look at them cook because they use their bare hands to touch everything. If you can put away that vision, thought, their food actually tastes really good. Sorry to disgust some of your readers, but again, if you don't see it, you don't know it
3
Had a quick working lunch at the Turkish Food Stall No. 70 at Lau Pa Sat. We ordered a Eggplant Dip, Hummus & a Chicken Doner Kabap. The Eggplant Dip & Hummus were average. The Chicken Doner Kebab was good. Stick to the non vegetarian in this place - looked better than the vegetarian food
5
It's a huge octagon with an endless number of stalls inside catering for every single type of cuisine. All stalls have pictures which makes it easy to choose and they are all cheap - roughly SGD 4 to 8 for a main dish or set meal. Drinks come from a couple of stalls where you get warm cans but a large cup filled with ice for SGD 1.80. They also do iced teas and smoothies along with (cold) beer in pitchers along with hot drinks. It can get warm inside but if you want satay then go outside where the street is closed off at night for hawkers selling the stuff which is awesome. Top tip is take tissues or napkins as they don't exist from these vendors!
2
We visited Lau Pa Sat a few years ago and the chilli crab and satay was to die for. We returned last year and found the place run down very dirty and most of the restaurants selling Chilli Crab had closed not a good start to the night. The satay was vey ordinary and to top it off the toilets were blocked and disgustingly putrid. Looks like they had not been cleaned i a week. Food tasted ok but the next day filching out to Perth was as sick as can't blame anything else as the was all i had had to eat in the 12hrs leading up to the flight. Sorry won't be back will got to East Coast Rd hawkers instead
2
Visited on 2/20/2105 during the Chinese New Year and only about a third of the vendors were open, but there were many, many folks walking around and eating. Walked around the entire place, read menus, and our party sampled teas, juices, pork, chicken, rice and noodles. Reminded me a bit of the truck/trailer/tent food vendors at county fairs. The prices were very reasonable ($2-$5 for a meal) and the food was tasty. Be prepared for the lack of US standard sanitary conditions (make sure your vendor has an “A” rating showing), handling of food (often 2-3 people hand prepare your meal), bones in your food (the bone in signifies a better tasting portion), and no napkins (locals bring their own, some vendors will give you a napkin if you ask for it)
4
Fantastic selection of everything Asia food.
From dim sum to chicken rice to fish head curry to satay and icy desserts, it's all here and for not much money at all. Absolutely great
4
I ate Smoke Duck Pho -soup and my wife satay with rice etc. I like to mention especially the duck soup, it was simply tasty!
5
Lau Pa Sat also known as Telok Ayer is a nicely renovated old market building made into a fancier form of hawker place. Great place to test many (mainly) Asian cuisines and dishes as well as some Mexican, Turnish, etc - in an affordable way. Just queue up and buy what you want from the different stalls and have a seat at one of the many tables. Must try is Bau Luo Wan Xiang Dim Sums and also their egg tart (best ever). Enjoy
4
Singapore is known for its modern high-rise buildings and fancy malls. Lau Pa Sat was more like a place you expect in Thailand or Indonesia. The service was good and friendly. We had cold beer and some Satay and was lovely, it was good value for money as well
3
Lau pa sat is contained in an ornate covered food court, seem to be more luxurious than other hawker centres, however food stalls are varied and all looked appetising. We chose an Indian vegetarian stall, and had a chapatti veg meal at $6.50 filling tasty and freshly made. Well worth visiting if you are looking for a cheap evening meal
4
this place locates in the middle of the concrete buildings which caught my eyes from the first place from its unique look. There are many types of food serving there from Satay to Indian. In case you want to try different things this is a place for you.
4
Wow, so this was so much fun. I had the indian and there were lots of options! my friends had the satay and OMG, their eyes rolled at how good it was. If you are in Singapore, you must try this place and if you are not a vegitarian or vegan go get the satay
4
Happen to be on business near the place, so patronized this place for four days, lunch and dinner.....choice abundant, prices reasonable, very orderly and controlled for a crowd of this magnitude. Indian food was available in plenty with some leading chains like Anjappar, Komala's, etc. there were other indian outlets which were equally good and cheaper too. Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, Malay, indonesian, western, etc, all making the choice very difficult to choose from! A place worth to visit to have a feel of the life of a singapore white collared

Lau Pa Sa hawkers was passable and here’s why. We went there twice, first time late, so only about half of the stalls were still opened. We tried some carrot cake, some noodle, some chicken rice and some satay. The first and the last dishes were good, the others were average. We also tried some sugar cane juice which was ok.The satay we bought directly from a stall outside the building. All satay stalls were cooked outside along a short track of road which was blocked off for the purpose. The satay were very good helped by the excellent sauce. It was the second stall counting from the edge of the road at the further end.On approaching the satay area just outside Lau Pa Sat, you would be solicited by dealer-like people into taking up their deals of satay dishes. We had a look at one of the menu on offer (including chicken, mutton, beef and prawn), asking a few questions, were agreed on some and refused on others, and felt we were being pressure into taking up deals that we were not sure too quick too fast. So we declined and left getting back inside the complex. On leaving they showed signs of their unhappiness. We eventually ventured out again and bought directly from a stall holder avoiding the dealers.On our second visit to Lau Pa Sat, we were earlier so there were plenty more stalls available. We ordered a variety of dishes including more satay from a different stall to the first one. The stall, which looked even more attractive, was the second one counting from the middle of the satay ‘road’. Contrary to its look, the satay this time was so dry and the sauce was also a non-event. The other dishes were average but overall however, we were filled up after our day trip, so no complain there.From the receipts we realized they were linked somehow to Kopitiam foodcourt chain. We did try twice at a Kopitiam foodcourt near our hotel. Their food were average so was Lau Pa Sat. Nevertheless, you would enjoy the atmosphere at Lau Pa Sat, very crowded, noisy, fun and smell wonderfully
3
We visited on a Sunday lunchtime therefore understand it would be quiet but it truly was deadly quiet.We opted for some Indian food & was basically rushed in to making a decision on what to order & when I refused to be rushed I was simply ignored!The food I did eventually order was tasty & great value for money; the portion size was enormous.With the vast choice of restaurants in Singapore, I would perhaps ensure you visit Lau Pa Sat on a buzzy Saturday night
4
Had dinner here last night. We were a little surprised at the amount of western food available but over all it was good food done cheap. If you see the little man passing out satay menus say yes. They were the highlight of our dinner.
5
Buzzing atmosphere and amazing food in the satay stalls, it's a must. The food is cheap and much tastier than what you would get in a restaurant.
5
Pick and choose between top Singaporean dishes! Try the Singapore noodles, red curry fish head, stingray, etc. Pick the longest line for the best food
3
The food was reasonable, but expensive for street food. A plate of satays for $23???
There is a lot to choose from, but I wouldn't say that this place is good value for money.
4
Our taxi driver recommended this covered area where a variety of different foods from China, Vietnam, Thailand and others are on offer. All the food we tried was good and very tasty (and ridiculously cheap - this is where the locals eat). in particular the Dim Sum stall was fantastic and you could purchase a couple as a starter or more if you want more. The term "street food" might conjure up worries about dodgy tummies, but we had no problems whatsoever. We would eat here again, no question
3
Went to the new refurbished Lau Pa Sat for dinner tonight. It was very disappointing to see Pizza,Turkish,Patisserie & Burger stalls? Who wants that at a hawker centre? The satay guy came around and took our orders for 20 of the $0.70 satay sticks,and never came back. The food we did try was the worst in 5 days of eating in Singapore so we left(very hungry). Only 18 months ago I ate there & it was great,this new set up is Lau Pa Crap!!
3
For a tourist it is a must to visit, however the food is overpriced and taste only average. I would actually recommend for Chinatown Maxwell hawker centre instead of Lau Pa Sat. Not recommended but can go there for the atmosphere, ambiance and photo taking of the CBD
4
We absolutely loved Lau Pa Sat... it's a hawker centre, so don't expect frills, and has recently been refurbed...The food is simply amazing here - you can pretty much get whatever you want... we opted for Indian Vegeterian some fresh juices and some amazing pastries...All fabulous - highly recommended... ignore the drivel that people have posted saying it's a tourist trap - it just isn't! - you will love it..
5
This is a Singapore special. From 7pm to late, the street closes and the satay sellers move in. Stalls 7 and 8 are the best. Get a seat, order the mixed satays (the prawns came ready to eat) and wait for the Tiger Ladies to come and ask you whether you want a jug of beer. Great value and entertainment
4
This is a food market with every possible type of asian food stall/restaurant you can think of. Pick a country and someone's selling the favourite dishes of that country here. This isn't presented as 'street food', if you're picturing that. More like a low end mall food court for aesthetics. But the food is good. Lots of pictures, lots to see, easy to order, easy to sample. Go ahead and be adventurous. Isn't that the reason you came to Singapore in the first place
4
lots of choices, from vegetarian to meaty, pork to halal, cold to hot desserts.... and the price is right! =)
and yes, we visited the place two days in a row! :D
5
Terrific variety to choose from, i had Indian and my daughter chose Chinese food. We went about 6 pm and it was easy to find a table. Easy to find from the Raffles Place MRT as it is listed on the exits.
3
Nice and clean place. Have various international cuisine for you to select from. Nice ventilation too. Worth a try =)
5
Had been trying all sorts of different eastern foods in Singapore but all of it culminated in this place. This place has tons of hawkers selling all varieties of eastern cuisine. The spread is just insane. I had some great Kway Teow here.
3
A very decent little place with cheap food. I would recommended the satay sticks that were a bargain at $0.70 each. Good taste of all variety of Singaporean food.
5
Renovated and reopened Lau Pa Sat is one of the best food centres in Singapore. All the hawker staples are here along with some more global choices. After 6.00pm Boon Tat st is closed off and the Satay stalls come to life, a must do.
5
An amazing range of hawker food ranging from Chinese, Malay, Indian and Vietnamese through to western style food. The main focus is on Singaporean foods with a Satay Club outside in the style of the old Satay club of old (ie. The one that used to be on the Esplanade). The food is spectacular and great fun to watch being made. Satay skewers are about $0.70 each, minimum of 10.
4
We stopped by here for dinner on the night of our arrival with a friend who recommended it to us. We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of choice and variety of food and how cheap everything is. We tried out some satay, an extremely spicy sting ray, cold drinks and other delicious selections of food. The staff are very persuasive, so make sure you look around first and don't end up with something you'll regret ordering. As mentioned nearly everywhere, the food centre is located in a building which was formerly used as a market, and the architecture and atmosphere are quite pleasant. The only issue we encountered was an incorrect order, but otherwise, this food market is a must visit while you're in Singapore
4
Kinda forced hawkers area with central area rebuilt recently but outside in street are loads of Satay stalls. We REALLY wanted satay and a stall owner walking around the inside bit obviously realised and guided us outside in the nicest way possible -didn't feel pressured at all! What seemed like a huge portion of thirty chicken sticks and ten prawns was soon demolished by the two of us. Absolutely delicious and we didn’t feel blown out. Bought a jug of Tiger beer off the Tiger girls for $19, and food total $54 seemed really good value –stall no. 9 BTW!! Oh, take your own wet wipes or buy them off a hawker –everybody seems to benefit here!Pudding was black sesame seed ice cream -er, different. Wide range of ice's and wicked cakes available
4
I like many of the local foods that you're able to taste at Lau Pa Sat (the Old Market) : Chicken rice, Bak Kut Teh, Fish Ball & Soup, Laksa, Curry Fish Head, Tou Fu. Last but not the least, the Chillie Crab and the famous Satay. Less choice and difficult to get taxi back if you come close to mid-night
5
We went there on recommendation from a friend. The food was great. It was a hive of activity. People running everywhere delivering food and drinks. Huge fans overhead cooled us down a tad. We loved the atmosphere there and we will return.
4
Here is the commercial and financial center, surrounded by high-rise buildings. Many white collar solve breakfast, lunch and dinner in here.
3
So went here quite often after drunk. So basically good midnight and late night hawker Center. Various satay choices from prawn to chicken. Never tried for lunch.
So after you guys went clubbing, this one could be your choices
4
Great hawker centre with epic selection to choose from. Authentic cuisines served fresh. Had satays and beer and wasn't disappointed.
4
Good, cheap food eat in or take away. Stalls arranged by food type and ethnicity.
Don't expect something fancy, just hawker food and ceiling fans.
5
This is another hawker center, It's specialized in sate. We had chicken and prawn sate. Very good. You can sit down inside and servers with menus will come up to you. Make your choice and pay when they deliver.
1
Fell for advertising on local TV from a hotel room. Took a taxi especially Was very disappointed. Total rubbish food. Went around in a few circles, trying to find anything edible and got a range of dishes from a few places. Nothing tasty at all. Wife and daughter ended up being hungry as could not eat it. So many nice places in Singapore to eat. Do not go there unless you want just something cheap and tasteless.
3
We enjoy sampling the local cuisine and this certainly is the place to do that. A huge variety of stalls and vibrant atmosphere. We watched as a number of tourists fell into the trap of sitting at a table, and then when presented with a menu from some far away stall, thinking that they had to go with that option. Just smile and say no thank you, and then go and discover the various options. We tend to be very careful about where we eat, but I didn't feel concerned too much here, as I think the general hygiene standards are probably ok. All in all an enjoyable experience. We found the food fairly basic, but very cheap. It certainly isn't gourmet but never the less tasty and satisfying
4
Apart from Singapore local food, it also has some Chinese, Indian, Korean and even Japanese dishes. Some of shop keepers are very friendly. They explained the way to taste the food from their countries. The cost is very reasonable. Recommended to go in the evening because BBQ food hawkers only start their business outside the market after 7pm
4
Here I often bring friends and groups of people. Usually they decide that they like to sit outside in the nice evening warmth of Singapore next to the satay street. We are looking up at the skyscrapers while enjoying our satay and a variety of other street food. Here, everyone finds something enjoyable for his or her taste buds. Many tables are available for big groups. When you sit down to reserve a table, do not be taken in by those who want to sell you immediately their food, but take your time, look around until you find what you like. At times, I just sit their and watch the many comings and goings – very entertaining, especially the many Satay street hawkers and their customers. This old building, a former wet market is great for shelter and its construction
4
To eat cheap with some quality and variety go to Lau Pa Sat. Situated in the middle of skyscrapers and in the financial city it´s a good place to rest a little and start to discover new places of Singapure. Near we can visit Chinatown.
2
don't be cheated by all adverstisement..... there is very quite there compare to satay clyn street which ia just beside the food court.... just finished renovation but the food still awful.... really sorry for too honest comment cause i don't want people being dissappointed
4
Love this place. Various choices of different cuisines. I had delicious dim sum, bah kuh the singapore style and chicken. The place is always packed. Finally finished with an excellent espresso :-). It's a place to come back to.
4
Choose from different hawker stalls. Excellent sateh!!!
Sitting outside on a closed street under skyscrapers.
Not the cheapest location around but good food.
5
I don't eat in the newly renovated inside section, but when they close the street at 7pm (6 on weekends). I've eaten at mist of the stalls over the years and think they are all good. If you love your satay, you will love LaunPa Sat
5
Lau Pa sat is nor a restaurant, is an ancient food court plenty of small business with dishes from almost all Asia. You can taste food from India, local from Singapore, Chinese, etc.The best think is that this market is from 19 century and was upgraded preserving the structure and the spirit of the place and you are transported to the past on your visit. It is a must on Singapore
4
Lau Pa Sat has a bit of everything. There is food of every description, and plenty of choice of outlets. The main section is under a roof top but at night there is also the outside option under the warmth of a Singapore evening. This is very casual but lots of character and fun, and is a very authentic asian dining experience
5
If you are staying anywhere close to the Marina Bay area of Singapore, you have to try the food centre (hawker market) at Lau Pa Sat!! We spent 7 days in Singapore, and we ate here at least once a day, just to sample the wide variety of foods available to eat in this foodies heaven!! Do some research on the types of food that you can expect to find in a hawkers market, it can be a little daunting, or just dive into the deep end and try something completely out of your comfort zone!! The centre is clean, recently been updated, and there are foods from all the ethnic groups that live in Singapore. And for breakfast, try the Kiah Toast, $2.50!! The coffee that is served with this is uniquely Singaporean, hot, sweet, strong, milky and oh so addictive! You can get this breakfast just about anywhere in Singapore, but if you are nearby to this centre, why not try it
4
Went here for some late dinner around 11pm. The satay is so good, you can actually smell the aroma of food when you get out of the mrt stop. I tried the chicken beef and shrimp satay. Then went Inside and got dim sum and roast duck rice. There's so many food choices in this laid back dining experience. I really loved eating here and will come back again for sure
5
I used to go to the Satay Club at Clarke Quay but it disappeared. Found Lau Pa Sat and it is the same. Lots of men running at you to get your order - first the number and type of satay, then someone else for seafood orders, then rice or noodles then drinks. Then they all come running back with your orders.The satay is spicy and sweet, the sauce is amazing - I just like to dip the cucumber and rice cake in it, would lick the bowl if I did not have manners.Definitely a go to place to eat in Singapore
5
It is z must. This place have any imaginable street food from all over the world. It is cheap very good street food and it has just been renewed so super clean. With 5 /6 dollars u have plenty of food!!! Racommended!
4
We decided on the chicken rice and carrot cake, black and white. I forget the name of the stall, but there are lots to choose from. Both dishes were good.
I would try another hawker center in the city before returning to this one.
5
The best time to go to Lau Pa Sat is in the evening around 7 pm when a side road is closed and the tables and chairs are laid out for diners, and the satay stalls start grilling their meat. The aroma of meat grilling and the al fresco dining experience are defining experience for any visitors to Singapore. A popular satay stall is Number 8. As there are many other stalls selling other Singapore food, it is best to order not too much satay in order to try other local food. For a party of 4, I would recommend their Set B which comprises of 10 skewers of beef, chicken, mutton and prawns. This could then be supplemented by the kambing/mutton soup which is served pieces of bread. Other food to try include the fried squid or calamari and sambas chilli stingray. The prices of the food are reasonable and almost the same as elsewhere in Singapore despite the fact that Lau Pa Sat being a tourist attraction. To quench your thirst, beers by the jugs are reasonably priced. Else, try the sugar cane juice drink. Dress comfortably as it can be quite humid. After dinner, you can walk around and explore the market and its other stalls too or look at the bells which are housed in the middle of the market.
4
There's a lovely range of food, most is excellent quality; in particular we've enjoyed the dim sum, which is an unusual find in a food court. I reckon this market has about the best range of hawker food we've ever seen.The building looks splendid again. It's such an unusual place in Singapore, I'm so glad to see it preserved, and once more looking better than ever.When the centre is quiet, in the evenings, the cleaning staff (possibly less on duty) cannot clear tables within a reasonable time. I don't like seeing dirty trays left on tables, as it encourages vermin. A cockroach ran over my wife's foot! This shows the importance of cleanliness.It's hard to believe this building only re-opened a few months ago when you visit the toilets. In the gents, only a few cubicles have a toilet seat, and while the toilets were acceptable, they really do need a thorough clean.In the evening one side is a satay zone, and full of smoke. There's plenty of other places to sit with clean air, and we never had problems finding a table at the edge, where we could enjoy a great view of the city skyscrapers. Inside many tables were occupied, but there were plenty of places around the edge. The toilets are right by the satay zone, so asthmatics may with to avoid them.Will we still use it? Yes, but if possible we'll use toilets elsewhere. The food is great, and superb value right in the city centre
5
This large large food hall has been around since the 19th century but has been renovated and is clean and inviting. There is no air con which in Singapore is something to consider, but along with a huge variety of food stands there are nice cold beverages and overhead fans. It's in a downtown area close to many interesting areas. We walked over to Chinatown, which in itself has plenty to see
4
It took us some time to find this place after seeing two less than attractive places.So much beautiful food to choose from and not enough days to try the different menus.Don't get there too early because the satay street vendors aren't around until after 6pm. Who closes a street to sell satay skewers - SINGAPORE
5
We ate really well here on both occasions, looked clean and tables were cleared quickly - which is important, as it gets rammed at lunchtime being right in the middle of the CBD. Share tiny tables with business men and women slurping up noodles. Sit outside for a slightly less humid environment, tables with small packets of tissues on are reserved
3
The hawker centre has re opened a few months ago. The place is more airy and added more seats to cater to lunch time crowd. However the cleanliness of the hawker centre is a big problem.Reason being the washing plates area has turned into an open concept place. A few pots of plants has been placed alongside the washing area to block off the ugly view of the area. It should have done better to do up a portion to block off the washing area completely from the street view. The plates does not seem to be clean properly too.All food prices including the stays sold at the hawker centre have increased a lot as all food vendors have to pay high rental for their stall and thus have to pass onto to their customers. It's not a place I would want to go to if I have a choice
3
Its one of the famous Hawkers and we proceeded there to check whats new and something distinct. It has lots of stalls and it has even stage for shows while enjoying full meal. We order Satay Platter of chicken, beef and pork. The surroundings was not clean, trashes everywhere. But if one prefers Filipino and Indian food, aside from the Malay food, troop here
4
I went to Lau Pa Sat on July 2013 (the date of visit option don't have option before Dec 2013). I went there at 2 pm not knowing that it was fully open after 5pm. However, there were several stalls which had already open. There were sooooo many stalls. They even had a lane closed for the satay section - yes, there were that many satay stalls. I tried Andra Curry. The portion was HUGE.
4
Great place when travelling with the family and everyone wants something different to eat. It's not a gourmet place but the food is good and not expensive
5
Great food and so much variety. Food all of a great quality.
Boon Tat street which opens at 7 and sells the best satay is just outside.
5
This is an amazing location with tables set on the street and serving great satay and other asian dishes like noodles and indian roti. Its a hawkers center and very reasonably priced. recommend to avery tourist visiting singapore
4
The satay are scrumptious and what's a better feeling than better sitting on a closed road, sweating it out and feasting on some real good sticks of satay.
4
Grabbing a large table on Satay street and ordering a barrage of jugs of Tiger beer, drinking the night away in the humidity while devouring tiny Satay skewers and delicious grilled seafood. This has to be the best way to spend an evening with friends in Singapore, experiencing a bit of the old amongst the new. Pray for clear skies and hustle your way to a table. Be sure to get the attention of the Beer ladies and be nice or you could be waiting a while for beers on a busy night. Also, make sure you select wisely the menu's, as once you have one, that hawker almost owns you and you won't be able to order from anyone else. Don't be rushed by the hawkers, take your time to peruse other menu's available before you choose the food you want. Don't be afraid to say No, and you will have a fantastic and cheap evening
4
Lau Pa Sat seems to have improved significantly as a result of the recent renovations. I do, however, remain confused as to why it took so long to carry out the work. The interior is certainly looking a lot better and there seems to be substantially more seating available. Prices seem to have increased a little, but that is to be expected: no doubt the rent has also been raised. Good selection of places to eat
4
A very well organized hawker center, Lau Pa Sat has a little bit of everything- across Malaysian/Singaporean, Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian options. The quality of the offerings was very good- i had a bit of delicious Char Kway Teow cooked fresh, and then some Laksa but there were many more things on offer - one could easily eat here for a month and not get to everything in the stalls. As we had gone for lunch it was a bit steamy, the fans helping a little bit to cool things off. Value was quite good as well. A very easy choice , and everyone will find something they will like
5
For those new to Singapore, this is a cheap and cheerful dinner market place with a wide variety of food to choose from. It's in an older colonial style pavillion that has been restored and has many established food stalls and eateries inside with tables and chairs plus a large outdoor area with cheap satay and beer in abundance
4
The food here, and especially the variety is just amazing. There's something for everyone and the value for money you get here is good. Okay, it's not all as authentic as the traditional Singaporean hawker centers, but still it's good. During weekdays the satay street opens at 7pm. Definitely go and sample that
5
I visited Lau Pa Sat once when I first visited Singapore, and then when I visited recently it was closed down for renovation. I got the chance to visit again this October and the new look Lau Pa Sat is great - still excellent street food set in an unpretentious open-air kopitiam
4
First, go to Cicky Fun and order A Chicken Wanton Noodle, then to Seng Kee for a Carrot Cake Combo and finally to Kway Chap for some Braised Duck!
And don't miss Tiger's happy hour at 7pm!!!
5
This Foodcourt offers a wide variety of Singaporean and Asian food, but is cleaner and nicer than most foodcourts. Prices are a little bit higher but still competitive.
4
We visited the newly refurbished Lau Pa Sat which is a delightful old Victorian building. There are loads of different outlets selling a wide range of cuisines. I had Indian and it was delicious. Great building great food

It's the oldest food court that's recently undergone a renovation so it was buzzy, clean and very reasonably priced food (the city can get quite pricey) and you can try many different cuisines. It is very busy though so nab a table fast by putting down a business card on the table to save a seat.
5
We were told of this place by a member of staff at our hotel so we duly took the train to Raffles Place and found this large pagoda style building completely dwarfed by the office blocks all around it. It has a history and apparently was once a wet market but now it is a terrific place in which to soak up the surroundings and the constant comings-and-goings as you enjoy your choice of food from just about every Asian kitchen you could imagine. We had a mix of Chinese and Vietnamese snacks and a beer for a very reasonable price (you order and pay at the stall of your choice and then find a table). Some great food and so much choice it really has to be seen.You must try and get there - it is impressive
5
It's a big food fest market with heritage building. Any kind of Asian food, name it, and you can find it all in here with reasonable price. Even this place is big and full, but not feel crowded because the heritage building has a high ceiling. Take a picture in some spots in here. It's cute
5
One of the essential 'Must do' attractions in Singapore. Cowering beneath an encirclement of massive tower blocks is this delightful period building resembling a British provincial Victorian railway station.One can eat either on the street or indoors, the ordering system is straightforward and the selection and quality of the food is fabulous. After filling yourself with goodies, stroll down to marina bay for a drink over the water
5
When I'm in CBD area, I love this location for the massive selection of options here: Chinese, Indian, Veggie, Malay, Indonesian, Satay, Noodles, Seafood, Middle Eastern/Mediterranean, Western, Mexican, Korean, Japanese, Dim Sum, Kaya Toast, Desserts. It's open air, so no AC so it can get a bit sticky for visitors.Best time to come is at 7pm on Fridays when they block off the street and have the satay options where you can order a set of 10 or so sticks (beef, chicken, pork) and some veggie options. You can also get mugs of Tiger beer (other options if you don't like Tiger).If I have visitors who aren't too fickle, I take them here at least once. It's cheap and easy option, just avoid weekday lunch when it can get seriously packed (unless you come early 11:15am or late 1:30pm).This place is a Singapore tradition
5
this is a very cool place to have some food and a nice cold beer. the atmosphere is very unique \and vibrant as you sit on the street and eat your delicious Satay.. and no one makes the best other than the happy people at stall 7 & 8.. great satays.. given with a smile and a lot of fun.. its the only place I go in Lau Pa Sat.
4
As a single female traveller who loves street food it's always a varied experience when going out to eat alone! The place was bustling with limited seats and only a few lone dinners. As I wondered around I was politely offered a table a variety of menus plus a cold beer! And if i said no to anything it was politely accepted. Food was good, not the best I've had but I would go back. A little too touristy for my liking, but that only ever becomes a real problem when they start adapting the food to 'western tastes'! Would go back and would recommend. If your new to Hawker street food give it a go I'm sure you'll enjoy the experience.
5
What can I say....brought here by friends to try out their satays. It was the best I have ever eaten. The people work hard at Number 8, are friendly and their food is excellent. Highly recommended!
2
Since it re-opened following an extensive renovation it offers very pleasant surroundings, and clearly a major tourist attraction. However when compared to other similar "tourist food courts" such as Newton Circus I found the food to be very average on quality and very expensive.
4
One of the best hawkers i have been to herein singapore. Clean and well maintained. And the food range is so awesome
5
...to eat Satay! Don't be afraid of the noise, the very low budget food stalls or the really screaming and running waiters trying to get you as a customer. It is great and that at a very good price as a bonus!And DO NOT get distracted from the "real" food court that is just in front of it, this is not what you have to look for! ;o
3
We were walking towards the Lau Pa Sat , the newly reopened food court when we were met with several hawkers "touting" satay. We were told to sit outside and they can help us find a seat where it is not so smokey. Inside the food court, the hawkers were moving around promoting their satay. We saw some tourists visibly irritated by the persistent hard sell

Lau Pa Sat or previously known as Telok Ayer Market in the nineteenth century is now a bustling food centre day and night. In the day, it serves lunches to thousands of people around the central business district offices. At night, tourists pour in the food centre for a taste of the local delicacies.Of all the local food, the Satay Club which serve BBQ meat on stick outdoor after 7pm over the weekend is the main attraction. But i find the quality of the satay is dropping after every renovation/upgrading of the food centre. But it is still the place where you can find many varieties of local food from Chinese, Malay, Peranakan to Indian in one place.You must not be confused or feel threatened when swamp over by the touters. Basically they are helpful and friendly. You should get a seat and settle down before looking for your favourite food.You can dine comfortably and safely known that you will not be overcharge here. Unlike other food centre in other part of Singapore. You will be expecting to spend average $40/person for a hearty meal with beer. So if you're a tourist and wanted to try out good local food in one place, Lau Pa Sat is it
5
Loved this place! Bustling hawker centre with amazing food! The set up is simple; there are about 30 or 40 'stalls' serving different cuisines (mostly Asian- singaporean, chinese, vietnamese, korean, japanese, malaysian, indonesian etc) and you order what you want. From then it is a very short wait. You can buy a drink from the central station and then its a matter of finding a seat! I had fried black carrot cake (a Singaporean special) which was delicious! It is a more upmarket hawker centre (good for tourists) but still good value for money! Fabulous
4
We went there after a recommendation from a friend who had been there before. We were all very satisfied with that choice. Lovely satay and a wonderful atmosphere. The smoke was thick from all the barbecuing and it was very crowded but we loved it. I can really recommend it
5
i really love to come here for satay.. on the day time its busy road because its around high office building area... but at night they close the road and put the table on the road... there is satay stall name, best satay 7 & 8... i think tneir chicken satay is best in town... too bad they dont sell 'babat satay' the beef tribe.... so whenever i go there i order from their stall the chicken satay, as for the beef tribe, i order from other stalls around it...

If you don't have time to go around Singapore and sample the best food the island has to offer, Lau Pa Sat is an okay compromise. Almost all of Singapore's cuisines and dishes are available here - the famous Chicken Rice, Char Kway Teow, Bah Kut Teh, Chili Crab, Satays, Sambal Stingrays, etc. There are also Indian, Malay, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese, Turkish, Costa Rican stall and a Wendy's outlet. And perhaps an indicator of the growing Filipino population, 3 Filipino food stalls. These may not be the best according to the locals and foodies, but it is still delicious and conveniently under one roof. The famous Boon Tat BBQ Seafood is in Lau Pa Sat but I've had better BBQ Stingray somewhere else. However, it's still passable. Most seafood stalls open in the evening, along with the rows of satay stalls outside, so time your visit around dinner time. Lunchtime isn't as packed with locals like Maxwell but getting tables is still a challenge. And just like in other hawker places, a tissue pack on the table means that table is already taken.Lau Pa Sat is a must visit especially if you don't have time to explore the other hawker centers or if it's your first time to experience a hawker center. There are surprisingly less touts here than in Newton. If you're after seafood, you'll be disappointed by the choices since there are only 3 stalls that offer it (excluding the airconditioned Chinese seafood restaurant). You might be better off at Newton, just try to ward off the rather pushy touts. If you're after Chicken Rice and a feel of the local lunchtime crowd, go to nearby Maxwell and head straight to Tian Tian
4
This is a great place to have food in CBD in singapore. Large and open air food center very busy in lunch time.We can find almost all the cousines here.Indian,chinese,turkish,malaysian,singapore local food and also all varieties of sea food is also there.
4
Great food at a very cheap price for singapore.This is a large open air food court,no airconditioning but plenty of ceiling fans.we had drinks and a great lunch for $35 singapore.
5
I loved Lau Pa Sat. It's a large hawker center in Singapore's cbd and one of the oldest as well. I recently read somewhere that it has around 80 stalls.Lot of variety available - it has local, western, malay, thai, middle-eastern, indian etc. available along with fruit, juice and dessert places. Plenty of vegetarian options available here!Prices are low too.For those who enjoy satay, there is a large open air satay section. I think it opens only in the evenings, most likely on weekends. But it's always crowded suggesting people like what they get here. Apparently, satay and beer makes a very good combination. One satay stick is 60 cents here!I suggest a visit here to experience local food court / hawker center experience. If you are a tourist, avoid weekday lunch time as the place will be super busy. Weekend evening would be nice
4
The hawker is located close to my company, and I go for lunch sometime. There are so many stores you can choose from. When you cannot decide the food or store, then find store which has a long queue. I like Singapore famous chicken rice in Lau Pa Sat. If you plan to go here for lunch, then recommend to order food by 11:30 unless you will be end up with a long queue
5
Telok Ayer Market, also known colloquially as Lau Pa Sat ("old market";), is a historic building in Singapore, and is located in Downtown Core within the Central Area, Singapore's central business district. It is currently a food center. There are several shops inside the market such as a 24 hours Cheers Store, a shoe repair shop, a tailor and a laundry store. In the evenings on the weekend a live band plays at the stage in the middle of the market.I tried all the things I can some of them like Black pepper Carb, Satay, Oyster Carrot Omelette, Squid Fry, Fried Rice and to end with the Ice Cream.In a true scene a Sunday Brunch. I loved it...
4
Lau pa sat offers quite a lof of food, which mainly are local.We went there at late night yet it was quite crowded. Although might seem a bit touristy, we enjoyed the atmosphere, surrounded by concrete jungle and the business of the area. Food are reasonable and cheap
4
Although a little touristy, food quality was great and reasonably priced. Went home happy!Had some of the satay brought in from one of the stalls outside. Extremely tasty and nice satay sauce. Would also recommend the Char Kway Teow and some of the grilled prawns. Beer is also pretty cheap
2
It used to have a lot of good & cheap local foods that attract both local & tourists but sadly those good local foods are slowly gone during the last 10 years and especially after latest round of renovation most of the stalls are taken by new owners that selling common foods that can be found in shopping mall yet their price are ridiculous expensive than the shopping mall!!! For those keen to try Singapore local food my advice is to head to any of the Hawker Centre where you can find good & cheap local food
5
It is a fantastic place, traditional food in a traditional market pavilion but fully refurbished with ample selection of food.We where six persons and got food from 8 restaurant, all good and at acceptable price.Tiger on Tap and custom plates and so on makes an even better experience.We where expecting something like Newton Hawker centre so we where positively surprised
5
Nicely converted hawker centre with an excellent selection of restaurants offering very good value food and drinks. Generally kept cleaner than many hawker centres and with indoor and outdoor seating available. Features many satay restaurants too each competing to offer the best satay. Jugs of Tiger beer were reasonable value for money. As someone who still enjoys Newton Circus, LPS offers better value for money, cleaner conditions but not quite the same atmosphere overall. If you are staying in the city then LPS is the one to choose. Highly recommended in a city with too many overpriced restaurants!!After your meal head take a stroll along Shenton Way to the bay area for one of the nicest, and safest city walks availabl
5
Great meals, good prices, loads of good Asian variety and at night, outdoor smokey charcoal bbq. Very authentic.
5
I travel to Singapore regularly am done must do is always, satay at Lau Pa Sat. Extreme good value, great atmosphere, great food. My favourite stall is Satay stall nr 8 for the best satay and prawns.
5
We visited this place on a weekend and we were amazed to see that it was so crowded. No wonder tje food selections are wide and the place is nice and presentable
5
We were really pleased when we discovered this hawker centre. We had some great food here and it was really cheap!! We had to queue at popular places but it was worth the wait and only a short walk to the marina as well.
5
The satay street in the evening is a must! great satay and cheap beer. we loved the atmosphere as well!
5
came across this whilst randomly walking around on the first night and you really have to visit during your stay. It is such a welcome break from the normal hotel /restaurant food. You have a HUGE variety of stalls /cuisine to choose from at a fraction of the price of restaurants. There is always a buzz around and you are getting somewhat more authentic food.
5
Best food court in the world bar none. Every taste is covered though you can find making the decision too hard.... Long queue for beers and soft drinks though so better to take it with you.A wonderful Asian experience that is always busy and fun
5
Arrived just after a storm, but the guys out in the satay market are used to it and very efficient. Great value satays - shared some prawns, mutton and chicken satays and came to S$22 for 25 sticks.Then went inside for some very reasonably priced dim sum and cold Tiger beer.Best to arrive after say 7:30PM and avoid the initial crush
5
Everything here is amazing. There are TONS of food options for you to choose from. The food is so cheap. My plate was S$3,90 and my husband's was S$6. The food was so good. The place was so clean. The stalls have to live up to health code standards, so you won't have to worry about the quality of your food. We went at lunchtime during the week and there were TONS of locals eating there, which is always a good sign. Great food, good experience, go here when you visit Singapore
1
LPS (that's the short for Lau Pau Sat) has a great location and a great architecture. Especially after the renovation. But please !!! It's the worse local food in town at expensive prices. All these stalls have somehow westernised their taste and practice prices that make you feel they make the food out of golden bars.Just got forced to eat there again. Had the worse dim sum I have had in SG - been here for years - at the most expensive rate.Disaster!!!For a more genuine experience with better food, try maxwell food court in front of the Buddha tooth temple.Still touristy but miles above LPS.
4
Searched for sate and didn't find it until after I paid $15 for a giant shrimp. Grrr. We are learning that no one wants to give napkins so bring facial tissue with you in this county. Love it here so far though!
5
amazing place with all kinds of different dishes from different countries from around in hawker style. Outside is sate place.
5
Very good way to taste different foods at a low price. From soups to satay to deconstructed sushi! Really enjoyed the experience!!
5
A huge choice of cuisines and meals.Crowded at lunchtime but really a MUST if you like hawker`s centers.I really loved the food, it was cheap and there was very clean
5
WE came here once just before the renovations were done and returned this month with the renovations complete. After a long wait it didn't disappoint us. If you love hawker food like we do this is place you should visit. Great options, delicious food and a great Singapore atmosphere
5
Cheap, simple and delicious! After 7 pm on weekdays and 5 pm in weekends Boon Tat Street at Lau pa sat foodmarket in the business district turns into a satay street. Fresh food. You eat at simple tables and plastic chairs. The ambiance is execellent! Enjoy the authentic food while you sit there between the skyscrapers. From fried rice to crazy deserts with typical Asian fruits like Durian.They have it all!This place is not mentioned in Lonely Panet. For directions: go to Lau Pa Sat food market (signs in town)
4
Lau Pa Sat is the first hawker market area in Singapore. Now it's been over shadowed by places like Makansutra Gluttons Bay. Recently Lau Pa Sat underwent renovation and for me it's become a better place to eat in. Why?- More food choices (and try to canvass around as price differs from restaurant)- Better ventilation (they have fans around)- Choice of indoor or outdoor.- Its well lit.However, i think Makansutra has a better location and better view (Marina Bay)
5
We were meant to have dinner at marina bay sands. However taxi we hop into suggested for this food market. Went there we were a little over dress but hell we spent the whole night sampling all the amazing foods. Satay sticks, Chicken rice, carrot rice just to name a few of the food we ate. Great, clean place. With a vibe of frenzy foodie local and tourist
4
The Lau Pa Sat food markets have recently reopened after a major refit which saw it closed for 6 months or so. The place is looking nice and tidy and, thank goodness, the food quality and prices seem to have been unaffected. This was our third visit to the markets in 10 years. We started in Boon Tat Street for satays. These are the best and cheap as chips. Our favourite is Best Satays in shops 7&8. Satays are 60c each and come with a great satay sauce. We reckon 10 make a good entree for two. If a street guy offers you a pack of towelettes for $1 - buy them. You won't be sorry.Boon Tat Street only opens at 7.00 pm and tables fill up very fast. Queues also form quickly..Next we ordered Chilli Mud Crab from BBQ Seafood just inside from the street. The service here is pretty crazy but it kinda works. Crab is sold by weight so the medium crab we were told would be $25 ended up more like $30 once weighed and taxes added. Worth every cent though. Getting a beer to with it was harder. The queues are long and slow. By luck I got to the top of the just as the crab arrived.
5
If you visit Singapore and want to try some street-food - literally - try the satay in Boon Tat street. The street (on the front doorstep of the Singapore Exchange) closes from 7PM to 3AM and the satay stales opens up. The merchants will pester you to choose their stalls - my favorite is 3/4 at the Robinson Road end of the street. Just sit down. The menus and beer lady will arrive promptly and enjoy some great satay
3
Lau Pa Sat has long been a favourite food market for downtown workers. It had been closed for the better part of a year, and has now re-opened as a Kopitiam market.While the traditional roof structure remains, all shops have been remodelled. While there's a wide variety of food on offer, it's a little hard to tell them apart since all stalls look very similar.The nighttime satay market still runs each night from 7pm
3
Clean place... have a lot of food. I buy ice strawbery milk the taste is so so...... for 2.70 $. Better I buy chatime or gong cha. U must try dimsum taste was good. There another option korean/Japanese food sound awesome. .. if u from indonesia, there is rumah makan padang authentic. .... kesannya gimana gitu tp belom coba. Soooo try go here and find ur fav food
5
This hawker centre has recently been renovated and the new establishment is first rate. We came here last year and it was ok but now it is extremely good. The choice of dishes was amazing, the prices good and very fresh and hygienic. You can sit at your table and a lady will get your Tiger Beer for you.Food was delicious. A must for any visitor
3
This was my second visit to Lau Pa Sat and I remembered it as a true Singapore institution. I still enjoyed the Satays but I remembered them being tastier. The food court inside is very nice but I thought the few dishes I took (Singapore noodles,mango and papaya salad, and spring tools) were a bit of a let down, a bit tasteless and bland. Whilst the building and outdoor dining is still amazing, the food isn't what I remembered. I would still recommend people go and visit and experience, but perhaps not expect the culinary happening I was hoping for
5
Got to go. This hawker centre is a must do. It has a satay street open at 7pm outside if you prefer. We ate everything for $5 per meal $5 beer. Great value best flavours vietnamese korean indian you name it yum. The building is very high ceiling with huge fans. Beautiful if you look up
2
I truly miss the old Lao Pa Sat. The renovated location looks very nice of course, but the food selection and quality has direly suffered from this face lift. And I am not even talking about the price hikes! I recently paid $11.3 for a mixed char siew/roasted pork rice, about twice as much as at a food stall on Phillip Street or at Amoy food centre...Sad to see all the good traditional hawker centers disappear from Singapore..
5
No visit to Singapore is complete without a visit to the satay stalls just outside the recently refurbished Lau Pa Sat. How can you beat 30 sticks of satay for $18? We devoured two plates and also 10 prawns. We arrived about 4pm so only a few of the satay stalls were set up, ate at No 10 from memory because he was not pushy than No 6. Everything under the sun inside from noodles to radish cake
5
The place has recently re-opened after a renovation. Had eaten there during my first trip to Singapore, thirty years ago. The food is still great quality with plenty of variety to choose from. Also very reasonably priced. I always enjoy eating where the "locals" eat.It was just a block away from the Westin, Singapore, where I was staying, so very convenient as well
4
This location houses a whole range of restaurants and outdoor satay vendors. Everything asian you can think of is available. However, the beer is pricey and once you order your food it can take some time.Satay vendors can only start at 7PM so if you go earlier you will wait. However it is popular and getting there a little early can secure you a table.The satays are delicious
4
Yum is the word. One of the hawkers on the road at lau pa sat is shop 7 and 8 for the best satay. We were given, chicken, beef, mutton and prawn satay. Was lovely soaking up the atmosphere of everything going on around us. Was very reasonably priced for food stalls. Been here a number of times when visiting Singapore and never been disappointed
3
There's a new Costa Rican food stall that is worth the try! Warning: Long queue!
You should try the Thunder Tea Rice if you'd like some Chinese Hakka traditional healthy cuisine.
1
We ordered satays and they all tasted of kerosene. Must have picked the wrong place. Beers were expensive.
2
Tourist trap with asian style fast food, anyone who likes asian food and knows what genuine asian food tastes like would be very disappointed, supposed to be famous for Satay but the Satay sauce was weak and bland lacking the flavour it should have, there are so many better food options in Singapore and less crowded too
5
Ate here more than once - the best satay in Singapore, but you can eat virtually anything, and the surroundings are very nice. Drinks can be ordered, and with a high turnover of patrons, you easily just people-watch for as long as you want - good atmosphere. A must-visit are in Singapore
2
Second visit to the newly renovated Lau Pa Sat. It's still a major disappointment. Many stalls run out of food before 9pm. And the with new seating configuration, less space and more people bumping into you. The old Lau Pa Sat also had better good choices. Give this place a miss. Huge opportunity missed with a renovation that retracted value and choice
3
Our first visit since the re-opening of Lau Pa Sat and we were disappointed. We always like to sit outside but not possible on this occasion (very busy) so we took a table on the inside. I guess we were fortunate because it then started to rain resulting in a mad scramble for under cover tables.The satay from Stall 6 was iffy, the first pitcher of beer was 'flat' but the girls exchanged without any fuss. The BBQ stingray was excellent as always. All things considered we will be back due to past experiences. I would still recommend this place to any visitor....the Satay Club has to be tried at least once
4
Went to the newly refurbished La Pau Sat for evening eating experience. Not as many traders but the food was just as good as I remembered from my last visit. The ultimate outdoor dining in Singapore a must for all visitors. We will be back again next yea
5
We went here in late June, two days prior to the new complex openIng. We ate here twice in the street stalls.our family of 5 enjoyed satays and drinks, rice etc for around $25. Second visit was better- we ate at the Satay Club stall - very good service and food.
5
There are many varieties of food choice and the prices are pretty reasonable. The satay club which is situated along the side street, beside the food court is a must go. There are satay chicken, mutton, beef and prawns to choose and not forgetting the rice cakes and the yummy satay gravy dip *drools
4
Revisited this place as I heard that it is refurnished. The interior and tables and better than before. More stalls are open even thou some are repeated but with some differences. The famous ones are the fried kway teow as usual and of course the satay club at the side of Lau pa sat. The variety has also increase which included a lot of European cuisine that ordinary food courts do not have. The bell chime reminds me of being in Europe. A must not miss if you are around the region. Try it as the interior still looks fresh and new
5
Amazing variety of food/cuisines you can find here. It has just re-opened after a gap of few months. More seating area, better ventillation. Must visit when in Singapore.
4
After many months of renovation, finally it opens for business again on 30 Jun 2014, with many more exiting food stalls ......
5
The satay of shrimp, beef, mutton is so good. The satay of chickedn is just fine. For two persons, I would suggest to have Set B (10 shrimp, 30 satays) and some chicken wings at the end of the street.
3
I was there after attending pinkdotsg , so hungry , and i tried to see what to eat, so finally I chose the seafood corner, which sell stingray, mussels, veggies, fish, etc , and I must say, it wasnt bad, some more this lau pa sat just next to the hotel I stay, so I tried something else in the next day, It's a good thing!! The price was ok, reasonable price , i didnt say I love it, but smthng that we can try to dip in when we walk around there , easy , very casual and pretty fast... Suitable for traveller who need somthng fast during their travel ..
4
We will always have a place in our hearts for La Pau Sat. It was where we had our first meal 'straight off the plane' as they say. So ok, it's full of tourists, but there are locals too. Yes it's not as well priced as other hawker markets but it's cheaper than most of the restaurants in the CBD area...but, it's got the original clock tower, the wrought iron frames and it's just been fully renovated. I love it here.I'm here on the opening night post-renovations and the place is pumping.The unique food here is the satays. The street at the back of the centre is closed off at night and the satays are cooked outdoor, like the original hawker stalls, over coals. The real flames and charcoal gives the satays a smokey flavour. As you approach the back area, you will have keen waiters approach you offering to find you a table and shoving menus at you. Don't worry, just take your time and look around first. They all take it well and it's all friendly. Each satay stall has a number on it, I like stall 8 the best. You can choose from chicken mutton and prawn. My favorite is the prawn, then the chicken. The mutton is a bit tough.Make sure you get some rice or noodles to go with them, you'll need to get that from another stall. Bring your own tissues or serviettes. The Tiger beer is cheaper by the jug.Enjoy
2
Went to try stall 7&8 presented with the special tourist price menu. When queried why their price was $1.20 per stick instead of 60 cents. Mmmm can't speak English anymore... Went to stall 3 tried 10 sticks, pretty ordinary chicken satay and a nice warm draft beer....Very disappointed was looking forward to enjoying a feed of satay and some beers.. Left pretty quickly.Hopefully it will improve once the renovation has finished.
1
The Stall owners keep trying to get you to sit in their area.The menu is not self explanatoryTheir prices are good but the quality is Bad...Not Bad sorry very Bad or even terrible.If you ask for Singapore chilli crab they haggle on the price and spoil it for you....most unlike singpore...feels like bangkok...haggling for price.If you ask for paper tissue you must pay.The drinks are also bad and a rip off.Once you order they just dish something even if its not what you ordered no one pays attention.if you want to enjoy street food AVOID LAU PA SAT hawkers street.when I was there it looked like ghost town...just a few locals from around the place.The satay was not so good , ,The pepper crab was just about ok , the fried rice was awful and the service pathetic.I would strongly reccomend the hawkers Food Village in East Coast parade...its much better. yes you may pay a dollar more for each dish but they dish out quality and dont try to cheat
4
While Lau Pa Sat itself seems to be under construction, presumably a renovation, it is the evening Satay stalls behind the pavilion that we enjoy. In the true tradition of Hawker Stalls, there are a number of vendors offering satay and other side dishes. As you enter the area, you are offered seats in 'their' section, but a quick browse of the other diners and you'll see that many of them are seated at the stall labeled "Best Satay" stall number 8 (in the past we've always eaten there but it looks like they and stall 7 and the same people)As you sit down, you will be given one of their menus for satay and other dishes. We've only tried their satays and love them. Immediately, you will be descending upon by others wanting to sell their side dishes and soft drinks and beers. It may seem daunting, but a polite "No Thank You" is sufficient but we've tried some of those dishes and found them to be tasty.You can order chicken, mutton (lamb), beef and/or prawns by the quantities of 'sticks'. We typically get an order of 20 sticks (10 each of chicken, mutton, or lamb) which is $12 SGD which is about $10 USD. It comes with a bowl of peanut sauce (wish I enjoy) and a side of raw onion and cucumber pieces.You might want to bring some paper towels or tissue with you as they don't provide a formal 'restaurant setup' but on this latest trip we did notice they do have towels available on some of the tables.It's a short walk from the MRT train (5 minutes) at the Raffles Place stop (#14 on the east/west or #26 on the north/south lines), just follow the walk through the train station following the directions to Lau Pa Sat. As you approach, you're going to think it's closed, which the pavilion is (during the construction), but as you get closer to the street behind it it comes to life with diners.Hope you enjoy it
2
This place was one big dissapointment....As it´s currently being renovated, the stalls are in a nearby street. The service is rude and only thing they care about are their money - at least the lady from the Tiger stall and the one we ate at were like this. We asked for the rice with sate, it was cold. I asked for chicken sweet and sour and was expecting something really good as there was a sign saying they received some culinary award. The chicken was fried and swimming in the spicy sauce from the bottle. Well, I guess everyone can cook like this. Also the food was expensive comparing to food in China town or Bugis, where the food was half price and delicious. Not worth going
