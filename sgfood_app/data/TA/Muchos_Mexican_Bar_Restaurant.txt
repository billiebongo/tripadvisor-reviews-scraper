This was one of the few restaurants open on a Sunday at Clarke Quay. My partner enjoyed the calamari with fries. I had the fish tacos which were average. The service was nice and friendly so there is that. The serving sizes were generous.
1
Very bad service with me telling the waiters what to do and asking them for the service. There were very few customers. Food is not Mexican, portions are inadequate.
Not worth the money and the time
5
The food was great and it was very reasonably priced. Food package with soup , main course , drink & dessert for only $15!! The staff were rlly nice and sweet too! Rlly worth coming down :-)

Clarke Quay by the river. Windy, busy and noisy. View to the river nice, probably means more in the daylight than in the evening when it is dark. Area very busy with bars and night clubs, fortunately Muchos not right at the center of buzz. Muchos is one of the restaurants in the string of restaurants by the river which means there’s always customers and leads to the service not being too great, rather indifferent and hasty. Customer in and out, quick. On the other hand understandable being very touristic. In our case service was ok. I mean ok. Food is mexican or a version of it. Nothing too spectacular but pretty much what we expected.

I recently visited this restaurant with my wife and baby daughter. The food is amazing, service is great and the location on Clarke Quay is fantastic. It's so good we went back the following evening for more ! Highly recommended if you're looking for a brilliant Mexican meal
5
Visited on a quiet Sunday. Food was delicious, staff was friendly and attentive. Ambience was nice. Usually miss the location on crowded weekends, but was able to spot it on Sunday. Not many good places at Clarke Quay so this one is definitely on our repeat list
4
The food at this place is a bit hit and miss. The quality is great but quantity varies depending on what you order. As with most places in Singapore alcohol is expensive so make sure you go during happy hours which generally start after 6pm although these do not apply to all forms of alcohol
4
Ate here on New Year’s Day ! Great fajita trio and good sangria . I got the pitcher . Right in the river so you can see boats passing this is in The quay so near shopping as well if you want to do some before dinner .
5
Visited on our stopover in Singapore in early November after being disappointed previously in a restaurant in this area we had no great expectations but we were very pleasantly surprised.We did not have starters but ordered a Chilli con Carne and the Spicy Pork stew (this did not sound particularly exotic but was great)The food was excellent and the service was very good. I couldn't fault it and if I am back in Singapore it will be my first choice restauran
3
We went there for the first time. Food was just ok - we have had much better Mexican food at other places. One of our dishes was a bit too salty. Prices were reasonable though. Staff and service stood out. Amandeep especially did a great job. If they improved the food quality a couple of notches, it would be a great place to go
3
Me and my boyfriend went there as we were really hungry and they had vegetarian options for me. Fajitas were ok, salad was awful.
1
I was in mood for Mexican food. I did take the quesadillas, they were thrown on a plate, not even a salad with them. They were dry, clearly microwaved.
Service was rude close to be impolite
Prices are very high due to the area.
4
Good food and friendly staff. Eat at the outside terrace next to Singapore River and enjoy
all the people passing by and the bumboats. At night the whole area is lit with changing
colours and the bumboats have lights on as well.
2
Disappointing in cuisine and atmosphere. On the other hand, there is some creativity: the nachos feature chili & beans (not much cheese). Margaritas made with a mix. Quesadillas not quite "pesadillas" (=nightmares)...more like sleepy. Also: expensive for what you get
3
The Muchos' food was just like of any other usual eateries. A happening river front walkway adds to its appeal. Staff was very courteous. Overall, it was an OK experience.
2
If you wanna enjoy the view and chill it's a good place. Otherwise food quality really low. Nice to enjoy few hours but don't except good food
4
Our first dining experience at Clarke Quay’s riverside was in Muchos Bar. This Mexican resto serves a good selection of food and drinks including many cocktail options. Ambience is really good. You can enjoy your meal while watching the slow moving boats and various river crafts. Highly recommended are the ff:- shredded chicken tostadas- vegetarian quesadillas - grilled seasoned prawnsYou can pair those with rocky margarita, mojito and Singapore sling. Best for me is the mojito. Good food with warm service on a lazy afternoon. Awesome first time experience at Clarke Quay riverside dining, especially at Muchos. Will definitely be back.
2
Nice setting by the river,we just walked up on the off chance as there were already quite a few people sitting eating. Big mistake, I ordered enchiladas when they arrived they were small flat and tasteless,expensive too although most food and drink in Singapore is. I don't mind paying for expensive food if the service and food is good neither of these were at this place!
5
As we wanted some other style of tastes for dinner we decided to walk to Clarke Quay and look around for some other choice for our taste buds to saviour. We came across Muchos Mexican restaurant and bar, and sat down overlooking the river and I have to say, it was a great choice. First of all, the staff were friendly and they all were smiling, secondly the choice of dishes available was quite extensive, for a Mexican restaurant, and when ordering there was never a problem with asking questions about ingredients in certain dishes as I have a cheese allergy. My husband ordered the prawn burrito and he commented how light and fluffy the burrito shell was. The spinach and rice mixed with the large amount ofPrawns with their special sauce and cheese topping was sensational my husband said, while I decided to have the chicken taco salad with mango dressing which came out in the biggest taco shell I’ve ever seen. It was so delicious and tasty. The desserts were also really good, just easy sweets that were absolutely terrific in taste and price. I had the apple tortilla while my husband had the chocolate brownie. Yummy. The service 10/10 and the food was also 10/10. There was never a problem. Thank again. Great location
5
Brought my Girlfriend for a dinner by the river and my did Amand make sure it was all the more special. He took care to Ensure we had everything we need, and when we wanted a glass of Moscato, he whipped up a mix that was even better!
4
Muchos has a great location on Clarke Quay - the atmosphere is super and the choice of food was good. Service was quick and efficient and the dishes we chose were excellent. The view and vibe is great.
1
Very expensive for its quality...i had a chicken wrap & I was trying to find the chicken (the wrap was full of tomato and lettuce)...moreover the wrap was like it was uncooked...i don't think it worths to visit it.
3
The location at Clarkes quay was good but the food was a bit pricey for what u get! We got nachos and fajitas which were ok but would probably not recommend it!
2
Poor food, hidden charges and patchy service. I was disappointed. It is always a gamble with Mexican.
4
Muchos has a great location on the river at Clarke quay. The food is tasty and filling, if not the most authentic. However given the setting it remains a good option for Mexican style food in Singapore.
3
Just stopped for a snack at Muchos in Clarke Quay. Ordered Chimichanga and a burrito. The chimichanga was superb; crisp with jalapeños. The burrito was so-so; to be honest a bit bland. Prices were top end for the quality of food.
1
It is not a mexican restaurant its just a bad imitation. We ordered vegetable tacos, The thing they served us not tacos it was just tortilla and grilled vegetables then We ordered fajitas which tastes not good. When we wanted extra tortillas they said that we have to pay for it. This is ridicilous if you order fajitas every restaurant free fajitas as many as you want. This mexican restaurant dont even make tacos and fajitas, dont go there. Don't waste your money and time
3
We decided to enter this place noticing they had some vegetarian options for my wife. The snacks came pretty fast. The food was decent too. The chicken wings come with 10 pieces which is nice for a group of friends.However we were disappointed with the attitude of their staff - Aman. We got our first rounds of drinks quite quickly and i was enjoying my drink and conversation when i decided to order another drink which i did to this gentleman at the cash register. He acknowledged the order and also seemed to pass the message to the his colleague.However the second drink never came and we too became engrossed in our chat. By the time we realized the absent second drink, it was time to leave. When we asked for the bill, it had a second drink charged too. When i got this to the notice of Aman, he said "let me check". I was surprised at this statement. First they did not serve the drink, then added it to the bill and then they question me by saying they will check. Not a word of apology. Just a question whether i needed the drink once he checked and confirmed that they indeed did not serve the second drink.When i mentioned to Aman that the least i deserved was a sorry from him, he started arguing that he did say sorry which he never did.Guys - if you have this attitude run a fast food joint somewhere instead of being on Clarke Quay riverfront.There is nothing wrong in missing an order but putting it on the bill is cheating and not accepting your mistake or apologizing is the cardinal sin.Train your people in how to deal with clients. Come to India and understand what is service. you are not a cheap restaurant but have no sense of customer service
3
The Mexican food is mediocre, although the views and vibe if you get a table outside is nice. Some things are a total rip-off, like not serving any tap water or even local bottled water. Paying $8.30 for an imported bottle of water in a country with the highest tap water quality is terrible, and we won't be returning here.
1
Either I got served on an off night or the good reviews for this place are written with bias or by people who have no idea what good Mexican food tastes like.I'll start with the positives: The staff are kind and helpful. The location on the water is great.Now for the food: The cheese dip was served lukewarm and cold in the middle. It tasted like it came straight out of a can you'd buy at 7-11. For the price, it's also a small serving. The enchiladas were tough and dry (even with sauce on top). The meat tasted like it was cooked a day before, refrigerated, and reheated. It was bland. Taco Bell on it's worst day is better than what I had at Muchos. Reheated Taco Bell the next day is better than what I had at Muchos.Finally, there is no restaurant bathroom. Want to use one? Go to the public one around the corner. I'm sure on a busy weekend night it will be clean and pleasant
4
haven't had a mexican meal in years so was pleased with the lunch I had on a Sunday (restaurants don't open until 12.00 noon) this area is a popular night place which attracts huge crowds- hence the daytime visit
5
Excellent food with excellent service. Mr Amandeep was really helpful and cooperative. Wish him all the best.
4
It's a long way from Mexico so we didn't expect perfection - but the food and drinks were solid and the service was great. Nice location right on the Quay.
5
Roaming around singapore with hungry tummy? alight at clark quay and find muchos mexican bar and restaurant they have the best service with quality and delicious food, very friendly crew and the price is reasonable for there big orders for a heavy dinner.
4
Really nice staff (Aman) and legit food. Drinks expensive but so is all Singapore. I'd recommend as a nice mexican eat on the river.
5
Good Mexican food in Singapore is at muchos. Good canal side sitting. Good service n yummy food. Amandeep service was very good.
5
Ambience is lovely and amazing. Food served is hot n delicious.
Hospitality is good..On the whole it was a wonderful experience. Had a nicetime. 😁
5
My boyfriend and I spent our nights in Clarke Quay while in Singapore and got to know Muchos when we were looking for a place to have dinner. Staff is nice, location couldn't be better, you always get a table even on Friday nights. Several options for dining from Nachos to salads to tacos. We ordered chicken nachos, watermelon salad and tacos. Everything was delicious!!!
5
We visited Clark Quay on a rainy day in May and found this gem of a restaurant. Set lunch for $15 included 3 courses and a softdrink, and the food was delicious. Our host, Amondeep Singh, was courteous, efficient and very friendly. We were totally impressed with the service and with the food
5
That was our best meal in 5 days in Singapore! Infact this is the best Mexican meal I've ever had. The service is excellent... Very friendly staff. Aman from the staff (adorable fellow) made it so special for my 14 year old daughter by celebrating her birthday :) Must visit when in Singapore!! <3 Chef do take a bow :
5
Had a couple of hours to fill before catching flights home. Saw Clarke Quay on a city tour and decided to visit. Not disappointed. Lovely and cool right on the river. Fantastic service and wonderful smiles. Highly recommend Cheryl and Amandeep. Thank you.
5
First time in Singapore and found this restaurant right infront of our hotel, very nice, clean and the food was amazing! The salsa was very good and the quesadillas almost like my Mexican grandma used to make them, I highly recommend it :)
5
Had the veggie fajitas, soft shell tacos and enchiladas and all 3 were outstanding. A special mention for their freshly made guacamole. The bartender did a great job with the lime margheritas too. Great food and really helpful staff. A bit over priced though.
4
we had an early flight, this place was open ,clean fresh food overlooking the water it is located on the quay strip so would be a bit busy at night time. friendly, margaritas are ok don't get excited but the location is great.
5
Not only was the food very good, and the view great but the staff were amazing, they entertained our 6 month old while we ate our dinner
5
Tosh Zhang is a Singaporean actor and singer.Â last week he dine in Muchos . He enjoy Mexican food . He say he never try Mexican food before this is his first Time n Now he is fan of Mexican food . Thanks Mr tosh Zhang for dining in Muchos .
5
Singapore is notorious about its poor service in F&B. We went to muchos this afternoon and were shocked by great service that was offered there. The staff, Amandeep, was very courteous to change our order even though we ordered lunch fixed set meal. We will definitely go there as many times as possible as food was great and service was exceptional. Thanks, Niti
3
This was the second time we have eaten at Muchos but we were a little disappointed especially with the price of the dishes. The cost of the meals had increased somewhat which made what was only average food overpriced. I ordered the Mexican Spare Ribs which were nothing special, but the tortilla dish was far better. That riverside location is very nice, and it is a lovely way to finish off the day
2
The ambiance of the restaurant is nice and there was a good buzzy atmosphere but the food is just over priced and not good at all. The only half decent part of the meal were the nachos. We ordered numerous items off the sharing items such as tacos, quesadillas etc. They were all tasteless and the tortillas seemed stale. I wouldn't rave about the service either. They are very quick to clear up dishes even though I was still eating. After the second time the waiter picked up one of the plates to ask if we were done with the dish I just let them take it as it was the second time
3
The setting was pleasant, but sadly the meal was quite expensive and quite small.We chose a sharing platter and by Australian standards the meal equaled what we would expect for one person, but it's probably as we needed! It was tasty and perhaps a bad choice on our part. Would we go back - possibly not as there is so many options in the area.
5
Muchos on Clarke Quay, Singapore serves excellent Mexican food by the riverside. The reviews are varied, but we have no complaints, enjoying lovely evening meals here on two occasions.
Our favourites were the Ribs, the Mexican Steak, and the Apple Wraps dessert.
3
We walked in because of the view and happy hours (bucket of 4 corona - 48SGD Plus taxes) which was apparently cheaper than the near by bars & restaurants.
Good variety for vegetarians. Small portions with average taste.
1
Terrible food... not much taste. Chilli poppers seemed like they were defrosted and served up. Don't waste your time or money. Clarke quay has many other places you could enjoy.
4
We visited Clarke Quay on a Saturday evening. The neigborhood was packed with lots of people.Some from our group wants to try mexican food, so we opted to go to Muchos.The restaurant has two seating areas, indoor where the bar is, or outdoor with the river view.When we arrived, there was no seating available at the outdoor area, so we wsited inside.The waiter then moved us outside when the seating becomes available.From their menu we ordered chicken quesadillas, chicken tacos, and chicken enchilladas. I was actually quite skeptical to eat mexican food outside of continental America, because there are many Mexicans throughout the continent, generally Mexican food are pretty decent in the continent, besides that we lived in Los Angeles for some time, where we can find great authentic Mexican food every where.But to my surprise, the quesadillas are quite good, and decent portion.The enchilladas can be opted with red or green sauce of course, and this is the best dish from what we chose. Size was decent, it has plenty of chicken, and good sauce.The chicken tacos come in decent size, has a lot of chicken, goid in flavor, however the tortilla is flour tortilla. It degrades the quality of the tacos. Great tacos usually starts with great tortilla, and usually if it is corn tortilla.Service at this establishment was pretty standard, nothing to complain but also nothing special.In general, I can say it is a pretty decent Mexican restaurant in the area
3
One of our group wanted something non Asian in Singapore! So we ended up at this Mexican restaurant. We wanted a seat outside but it was packed on a Friday night. The service staff were friendly but one of our number didnt get her order until 20 minutes after everyone else. We felt it was a bit disorganized. The food itself was OK but not great. But we had recently been in Mexico so maybe our standards were a bit high. The tacos were a bit dissapointing.I probably would not go back because there are so many other choices close by
2
Had a dinner meal here with the family. The overall outside Clarke Quay area and ambiance is very nice. We decided to sit inside since it was quite hot and humid outside. The tables were found to be very dirty, not cleaned properly and had a sticky texture to them (even the paper napkins stuck to the tables). The wooden tables are not ideal for a restaurant, they are untreated and difficult to clean properly. The inside atmosphere wasn't particularly good and the staff were not very friendly or helpful. To be fair, some of the dishes were ok (Fahitas) but the ribs and tachos were disappointing. They offer a 'happy hour' but the prices are still excessively high, only a couple of dollars knocked off the price with most alcoholic drinks running in at SGD12-14. The total bill for meal and drinks was very high and considered not worth the money
4
We were dead tired after a full day of shopping on orchard road, bugis and couple of malls. Really wanted to go out for an area which is lively, buzzing plus relaxing. Clarke Quay fit into the bill as it had a live show in the main piazza running.. Almost all of the restaurants were lively and was picked because our taste buds were calling for some mexican food that day. Started with cheesy Nachos and Beer which was just so perfect. Main course was summed up by enchiladas and I relished it so much so to order another round of same dish. River side was pleasant too and added to the moment.Well done Mucho
3
I was there for an early lunch. (I was the only diner) After telling the server that I needed a gluten-free option. I choose the flajitas (U$20) These were not exactly like the flajitas in So. California, (and a bit greasy) but tasty, I was happy to have a safe meal
1
The staff need some training on basic manners1) don't bang the plate on the table 2) used plates are not placed but are just thrown into plastic bucket in front of guests.Regarding quality of food substandard at best , not sure they have a Chef, may be one of the waiters also does the cooking . Ordered veg burritos they served with meat - when asked the waiter just took the plate away not much of an apology just 'oh we will replace '.. Regarding cleanliness the chairs were covered with droppings from a lizZard .. Decided to cut my losses and head some where else to have a decent meal .not cmg back here agai

In the states we have tons of great Mexican restaurants. Great Mexican food, for us, is common. After a couple of months traveling in SE Asia, some Mexican food sounded great when we arrived in Singapore, and we found this place in Clarke Quay. We wanted to love it. We wanted to like it. But the food...was pretty average at best. Perhaps we had unrealistic expectations because we get such great Mexican food back home, but overall we were just disappointed with the food. The margaritas, however, though pricey were surprisingly good--but could have done with an extra half-shot of tequila. Our suggestion is go for drinks and appetizers for snacks, enjoy the river view, and save your Mexican food cravings for North America
2
The service was good but sadly the food quality was disappointing. Expensive for poor quality Mexican food. Very little meat in all of the dishes.
2
To start, any place in Singapore that charges you for water, and gives bottled as the only option (and charges $4.50 for the pleasure!) is taken down at least one notch. The margaritas were surprisingly good (rocks...frozen were horrid). Food was poor, no real idea of what constitutes good Mexican food...yeah, keep dumping that local spice on. Service was very average. Kind of odd to have one drink brought out, and then a couple of minutes later my wife's drink manages to find its way to the table. Much better options around
2
Service was good, but the food was totally disapointment. After starters I was planning to collect money to send chef to Mexico, donÂ´t waste your money to nachos or fillet jalapenos.The tortillas were a little bit better, but similar or better you get from every buffet
4
If you like Mexican cuisine and are in Clarke Quay then this is for you. Of course the area dictates higher prices so don't expect to get off lightly. A happy hour promotion can help with drinks prices. We had fajitas and the service was quick and the meal was very tasty.
3
I visit Singapore often for work and this is my second time to eat here. If there were a category for overpriced, mediocre food, this restaurant would be #1. The food is fine but it's certainly nothing special and, considering the cost, isn't the best choice. Singapore has amazing restaurants and is overall very expensive, but you could find better food elsewhere for the same. Cost. I had a quesadilla - it comes with salsa and sour cream. For the cost I would expect a side salad as well. It's right along the river, and location is great!
4
Mexican restaurant on Clark Quay in Singapore. They have a terrace with a view on the river. Very good Mexican food for a reasonable price compare to the other restaurants of Clark Quay. We were 4 persons and we tried the Quesadillas, the Nachos and the Fajitas. Every plate was tasty. Good service. The beer was expensive but it is the same everywhere in Singapore
2
Was wondering around this area looking for some place to eat as there was a lot of restaurants around. Would have to say we made the wrong choice, the food wasn't the worst i have eaten but not the greatest either, i had the enchilada and the portion size was very small and didn't even have salad with it or any vegetables inside it. They don't even have a toilet, so if you need to go you will have to walk 5 minutes down the street to the public toilet. My advice is to find some good street food, the price is better and so is the food and portion size ( China town was the best in my opinion)
1
I visited the place for dinner in the week of December with my wife and son. The place has two areas one the elevated more happening non smoking area and the other area on the side which is the smoking area. When we went there there were tables just for two available in the non smoking zone which I believe could have been made into for 3 by adding a chair. But I was offered the smoking zone which I was initially surprised with (given we were accompanied by our child) but I thought may be they are just trying to accommodate. I later realised that all Indians were usually offered that area to sit as on subsequent days when i passed by I realised that despite tables being available in the elevated area all Indians were always sitting in the smoking area.The food was anyways pretty average and with this experience I ain't going there again
2
This restaurant is located in Clark Quay.This is a so called Mexican restaurant.Service is very poor.The staff are indifferent.Orders taken were not served.After 30 minutes when reminded they say the dishes are not available.Quality of food is very poor.Not worth visiting.Better options close by
4
My family and I are an early dinner at Muchos in Clarke Quay. Can't beat the location overlooking the water in Clarke Quay, but you definitely pay for it! Our meal for two adults and three kids with a margarita and beer for the adults and mocktails for the kids + nachos appetizer topped out at SGD150 (including 10% service charge). Good quality was good, nothing stratospheric. Service was good but not many patrons in the early dinner timeframe. All in all a nice place to eat and the kids liked it (a win) but you definitely pay for the location/view! We'd go back
5
This was very good Mexican food loved it, lovely staff great cocktail we were early as we were doing a river cruise so for us oldies it was lovely and quite
5
Located rivers side in clarke quay . Reasonable price. Very good and fast service. Food very tasty and various menu.
5
Grabbed a couple of drinks and great Mexican food at Muchos late last Sat night. The place keeps up with the pace of Clark Quay...staff is prompt with service and food is quick and good. Outdoor seating is nice, breezy and comfortable.
3
We stopped in here for lunch mainly because an approaching storm meant that there was no time to look for other options.I really liked the food which was fresh, delicous and based on this small sample authentic.However the margaritas were frankly terrible. Made with a maragrita mix instead of fresh ingredigents and even then made poorly. I highly doubt there was a standard pour of tequilla in the whole drink. Seriously stick to the softdrinks here.It was lunchtime so in terms of atmosphere the place gets a zero and the staff were efficient but indifferent.I wouldn't recommend it but i also wouldn't say to avoid it
1
Texan family of 5 visited in December 2016. Let me clarify, family with roots in Texas that lives in Southeast Asia. I'm here to tell you, it's not even close. I've tried this place a couple of time to rule out a one bad stop. Nope. It's just not there. Chips and salsa is a joke. Meals are "seasoned" with spice that is a one-stop add, not the real deal. Go top shelf on the rocks for a decent margarita (the 1 star) but beyond that... nope
3
The best that can be said about this place is its location in Clarke Quay by the river. It is an apology for Mexican cuisine. We just had a huge margarita that was for sharing. The chips and salsa that came with it were supermarket quality. And of course, like everything in Singapore, the prices are stratospheric including the ubiquitous 10% service charge
3
Dinner at Clarke Quay is a must for any visit to Singapore. As we strolled along looking at options, mexican looked good so we went to Muchos. The staff were friendly and attentive. My husband and I shared some tacos and nachos. Both meals were tasty, though could have been a bit bigger especially for the price
4
Located in Clarke quay along the river , you can eat different Mexican food , both street food than other choices.I enjoyed the dinner with Mexican chicken wings, enchiladas with roasted beef and mixed sauces, and tiger beers . Service is fast and perfect, food is good with a well balanced spicy . A little bit high the bill ....but we are in Clarke quay. Definitively I enjoyed the dinner and I suggest to go in this restaurant if you like Mexican food 
1
Fast service, great location next to the river and the positives 100% end there. Muchos platter for two was a muchos let down, with cold wings, tasteless corn chips and a chewy calamari. The prawns where drenched in oil and the casedilla although not good the only nice part on the platter.
3
Visited late last night with my husband and son. My son had the fish nuggets and chips that he really enjoyed. My husband and I shared the Muchos platter that was nice to have some variety, it was just lacking something. The service was great, nice and friendly. Singapore food is expensive after they add on the GST and service taxes. The meal wasn't worth $85 with non alcoholic drinks.
4
I thought the mexican was great and the staff were helpful, attentive and pleasant. Having the option to sit inside in the cool or out by the Quay is great and the spicy salsa, very tasty
3
Decent food and drink and it all came out fairly quickly, although it was early in the evening and not very busy. Staff were friendly and professional.
5
we had some Mexican food which I always thought was spicy. But to our surprise, we had very good food with was not spicy and, in fact, was vert tasty
3
We visited Muchos Mexican Bar & Restaurant in Singapore in September 2016. Great location; right on the water. However, that's what you're paying for, not the quality of the food. Overpriced food and extremely high drink prices for average quality. Edible but nothing to write home about. There are many other places in the area to visit unless you must absolutely have Mexican! Great atmosphere though; music playing, but, would we visit again...sadly no!!
4
While exploring Clarke Quay we stopped here for dinner. Muchos has both an indoor seating area and an outdoor one overlooking the water. The outdoor seating area had fans, so it was nice and cool. I got the chicken tacos and although it only came with two it filled me up.As a side note, I can't take much spice in my food so I found these tacos pretty hot. I ended up having to order a drink half way through the meal. Despite this, I thought the tacos were still pretty good. In Summary: Not a bad stop for some good Mexican food, just make sure you order some water with your meal
2
Food wasn't that expensive for the area, but pretty poor Mexican food. Consistent with previous reviews, no flavour, stale, bland and I can make better Mexican at home. Nice view along the river, but many other places at Clarke quay have the same view so don't waste your time here
5
We were a little sceptical to visit a Mexican Restaurant in Singapore, but it was recommended by a family member. It sits right on the river at Clarke Quay next door to Hooters (which I will not be reviewing for various reasons).The food was great, it was quick, authentic and tasted great. The best parts of this eatery is location and the staff. The staff were so attentive, refilling water and even gave our kids free ice cream because of the spicy tastes of one of the meals. It's not cheap though, our quick easy meal with cocktails came to $130. Good atmosphere though. Worth a visit
5
My family and I had a difficult time finding gluten free meals in Singapore. When we walked up to Muchos, the waitress immediately said how great of a place it is for gluten free eaters! We sat near the water, ate yummy tacos and enjoyed ourselves. The service was excellent and the staff was so friendly, answering all of our dietary questions. Highly recommend
3
The food is average and somewhat bland. Besides, not being very flavorful, the portions were on the small side. I usually take pics of all my dishes to show off but it wasn’t even worth it. When one can make better Mexican food than the restaurant’s cook, one is not impressed and I wasn’t impressed. However, the scenery and the setting is what you are paying for and is the only reason why we stuck around for so long. If not for the river, I would have given it 2 stars
4
Clarke Quay restaurants are usually pricey, but Muchos has a set menu for lunch with good value. Nothing out of the ordinary in terms of mexican food, but we enjoyed our quesadillas and chili con carne. A soup, choice of 3 main courses, ice cream and a soft drink for $15 while sitting by the river is a good deal
5
The best Mexican food I ever had. Nice ambience and fast service go go and try this hotel worth a visit!!!
4
Good Mexican food with a great outdoor location by the river. Portions were adequate but not large and prices were ok. Service was great. Get there early for dinner if you can.
5
Came here for dinner ... I don't really expect a place in SE Asia to really get Mexican food right on. But these guys did pretty good! I had a burrito which could have been a bit bigger but it was good. The chips and salsa was good and the margarita was pretty good. The views along the river were excellent and the service was not bad. Overall it was pretty good experience

Muchos on Clark Quay looked inviting, but service, on a Monday night, was very bad. After getting quickly seated and served, it was 15 minutes before I saw another wait staff. I then ordered an additional drink (a margarita with a side shot of tequila, as I wasn't sure my first margarita actually had any tequilla), and after another 15 minutes of nobody showing up to my table or with my drink, I gave up and just flagged someone for the check. I could even excuse this on a typical Saturday night at Clark Quay, but really, no excuses. Also, for a Mexican restaurant, they don't offer complimentary chips and salsa? I usually don't compare the US favorably to Singapore, but in this case, Muchos has mucho to lear

Located on the Clarke Quay, the environment is perfect. Quiet, no car traffic, along the water. We stopped there for a drink in the afternoon. Wine was ok however the snacks (nachos and salsa) came straight out of the supermarket/can. Not sure about the rest of the food in that place. For drinks, surely a good spot

We tried this on our last afternoon in Singapore and left without feeling any wow factor unfortunately.The location is great, and there is no shortage of places to eat. During the afternoon, a lot of the places are closed so choice is a bit limited.We were there about 3 pm and liked the look of the place so sat down. The service was good, and food was ok, but only average in taste, quality and appearance.Not any real complaints and other people seemed to be enjoying their meals, but maybe our expectations were higher.We would probably go back but considering the alternatives, they would need to up their game a bit

It was my first time in Singapore and I'd have to say, my night-out in this place made it so much more fun being there. The food was nice and they serve in massive proportions. Still can't believe me and my friend managed to finish 4 dishes with that amount. The atmosphere was amazing. You have the river view to enjoy while having cocktails. They had a lot of customers but the service was still spot on. You get what you pay for (maybe more). Would definitely visit again if I go back to SG

On a hot Singapore afternoon, my family and I stopped at Muchos for a snack and drink. The nachos were excellent, as were the Margaritas. Watching the river traffic this way is the perfect way to enjoy the city in the hot part of the day. We will be back

Muchos had a great happy hour promotion and there were loads of people enjoying drinks with an awesome river view. We ordered some meals and were extremely disappointed. The food was just pre-manufactured food, heated and served. I had the Chicken Burritto and I could not tell that it was chicken, it was tasteless, brown sludge drowning in bottled sauce. Extremely disappointing experience. Good to get a beer and enjoy the view, but the food is a let down

Me and my friends had dinner here and it was nice experience. They had a very friendly staffs and the food was really great. I loved their beef nachos and fajitas trio. And really did amazed me to their coronarita drink. It was very refreshing. Same goes with my friends they loved it here. We will surely comeback here again. Kudos to you guys

Cool place to have drinks n Mexican dinner. They even have very good options in veg. Must try.Nice mocktails for non drinkers too.

Wy husband and i dined here this evening. We were lucky enough to get a riverside table and the ambience was fantastic. We ordered our meals and the food was quite nice. Nothing to rave about but nice enough. The issue appeared when we paid our bill which totalled $137.10- we placed 2 x $100 bills in the bill pay and it was taken away by a staff member who returned a short time later to say we had only paid $100. We explained we had paid $200 and she agreed to go and look again...this was then sorted and she returned saying the $100 had been found. Shortly after, our change was returned and should have been $62.90 but there was $10 missing. I asked the staff for the extra $10 and this was also fixed. I can explain away 1 money mistake but not 2. I believe they tried to steal from us tonight and whilst they were apologetic i feel they were also dishonest. A real shame as we had a good evening until the

Dined here tonight for dinner. Ordered the fajitas - they were okay but the tortillas were a bit stale. Reasonably priced and service was good
5
We had a dinner with a friend from Singapore on our stopover in our favorite city, where we have now our new favorite place.We are Mexican food lovers and this was really really really good!The service was outstanding. We had our little daughter from almost 3 years old with us and she kept the waitress, who did a amazing job, quite busy because she wanted to play with her all the time. They gave my daughter some extra maraschino cherries and a lot of spoons and plastic plates to play with.I had a Coronita which is so delicious, but also very heavy haha. We ordered a mix of dishes and it tasted all absolutely Mexican and really fresh.Next time when we are in Singapore we will definitely go back
3
I have eaten here a few times. Staff is always very nice. This visit I had the fajitas trio. It was too spicy. But I still like the restaurant and will return. Just choose a different on-tray.

TOURISTS beware of RIP OFF STALE FOOD!!!Went for a weekend dinner with my wife and few of my guests visiting Singapore. Major embarrassment had to walk away mid meal!First of all came in 2 hour earlier and booked a table clearly requesting a Riverside view from the hostess, coming back in the hostess casually seats us in at a corner no where close to the river side saying no tables are empty, then what is the whole purpose of advance booking.Anyways we took our seats no one came to serve us for the next 15 mins, finally after calling the hostess again she sent someone.Order was taken and the worst part here you have to shell out for water, which is not even chilled.Onto food quesadillas veggies option were bought in with sour cream and tomato salsa. Salsa was stale and the quesadillas dry clearly microwaved. Still this was better than what was to come.Next in tostadas veggies option again, onions and the capsicum were stale as if they were cooked and kept in the open for too long. Clearly fermented, at this point one of my guests spat back the food in the plate.Nachos veggies option a dish so simple, yet even this was stale. Disappointing presentations nachos were thrown in the plate with veggies and three blobs of sour cream, guacomole and something else. The capsicum, onions and zucinni all stale clearly cooked in the morning stored outside and thrown on the plate.Called the server and he was very apologetic clearly not surprised, i guess as he promptly asked to replace the dish and remove the charge seems he has seen and done this a lot.Anyways worst part we settled the bill minus nachos no manager approached us, we ended up paying for the tostadas, quesadillas and warm water. No chef to speak to no management nothing... Not sure how and why the health Department even lets them serve such food and get away ripping honest customer out for a meal, serving low quality stale food. Any food court serves much better and heathier food than this place. Definitely not worth the price and service. And just hope no one falls sick tmrw, even though we hardly consumed a few spoons ...No point going here esp when the best Mexican restaurant in town is just across from this place
3
In the riverside area of Singapore, the location is nice, even if its hot you can sit outside. The enchilada is weird, a lot of sauce. The shrimps are good and the chicken is nice. They should have more drought beers.
4
Efficient service with a smile from the busy staff. We visited on a Saturday night and although it was extremely busy, we weren't hurried. Alcohol was reasonably priced for Singapore and the food was value for money. It tasted good too and there was plenty of choice too! A nice atmosphere alongside the Singapore river.
4
Went there for a quick bite with my wife before we leave to go to the airport and our flight home. Service was quick and efficient. The food was very good for Mexican. Price was of good value. I would go again if I felt like this type of food.
3
Wonderful view from the outside sitting, Vegetarian food was average... Not much options to chose from... We ordered 3 dishes and stuffing in all were same.. Service a bit average at the outside sitting. Overall if someone is looking for vegetarian food, this is not the right place I suppose
4
We visit this restaurant on Saturday evening, and it was quite busy with diners.
Staff were very attentive and try to provide their best service.
Food was okay but nothing remarkable.

Located at Clark Quay Riverside next to the swings ball games. It's a out door restaurant with very nice view looking to the rivers, sometimes boats passing brings tourism. Waiters are very friendly and warm, professional in her job. We are not familiar with Mexican food she suggest view for us and we are happy with it. The muchos plater, chicken and rice, seafood nachos, beef steak all are yummy. Most of the visitors here are western and some Indian. The restaurant is side by side with others restaurant the crowd , the music and people's walking around make it really relaxing and fun to hang out with friends, couple, families and business partners.

Visited this place with my brother's family,with my little nephew in a pram,a d we were welcomed right from the first step onwards.The service was quick,kudos to the hostess and the servers.All my apprehensions about the food being truly vegetarian were set aside by them and I enjoyed my sumptuous, delicious vegetarian fajitas. Good job.Congratulations team Muchos!!
1
Definitely disappointing. Full of spices to cover the lack of taste. TripAdvisor sorry for not reading the reviews and going to this place. It could be easily be almost as good as the worst fast food restaurant meal you ever had. I trust that you can find better ways to spend your money than eating ther
3
Nice place to have Mexican but one would expect to have true Mexican dishes with authentic taste. Location is superb down at the Singapore river.
4
Set along side the river in Clarke Quay, this place is in a good location, serving tasty Mexican food. The staff were friendly and attentive and the food came out very quickly, however it was good and very well presented and reasonably priced
3
Our family dines at this restaurant and were alas quite disappointed. We frequent Mexican places and this one didn't rate with us. There was no rice with the enchiladas which were overcooked. There was no water on the table. We had to pay for bottles water. The wine and beer was outrageously expensive. i.e. $17 for a glass of wine. Only one of us enjoyed the food which was the Frijitos trio
4
Have not taken such delicious Mexican food for long time. The food we ordered were outstanding, tasty, hot, delicious and mouthwatering. It was the usual heavy crowd at riverside Clarke Quay at the beginning of weekends. There were hardly any places to walk or sit at any restaurant. We managed to get a table of four. The helpful friendly waitor came and took the order and cleaned the table. The food was served very quickly. We started eating the hot sumptuous meal immediately. It was just delicious in perfect weather. Lovely fresh breeze from the riverside made our outdoor sitting very pleasant. The heavily packed street and the restaurants and loud music all around did not bother us and we chatted and enjoyed the food. We ordered 4/5 types of dishes with non alcoholic Margarita and mock-tails and Bill pace was SG dollar 177. It was reasonable I guess
4
Good food, great view and place to sit by the river..Have a wide menu to choose from, the portion size is great. Authentic mexican food
5
We popped in for a quick drink while wandering around one Sunday afternoon. Had the Happy Hour beers. Service was excellent and very quick and friendly. Did not eat but would be keen to return and try the food
1
The service is very very bad. Dirty tables, unfriendly, unflexible. The food was very delicious. If you want to order something after you get the dishes, forget it.
4
Location is good to enjoy Clarke Quay night view and the food is tasty. My wife said her best Mexican food ever.
4
The food was ok, the service I am not impressed but relatively fine. I don't deny that I do have fun luncheon with my friends. Individual prefer different view and taste. Try and you will find out.

Just came out of this place for the first and last time.I had beef enchiladas. Before ordering I was told there were three enchiladas so thought the meal would be substantial. I asked whether it was served with rice & beans. Yes for beans, no for rice, so ordered a side of rice. $21.95 for the enchiladas, $3 for the rice. $24.95 total + tips & tax added to the bill.Whilst tasty enough, the enchiladas were 0.5 cm in diameter & about 6 cm long - like a tiny, mushy spring roll. The refried beans were in a sauce container, roughly 1 cm square or a maximum of 1 tablespoon in volume.My wife, not being hungry, ordered nacho chips & dips. Two dips with the same volume as my bean serving (1 tbsp in each) and a bowl of nacho chips (medium sized) - all for $10.95 - What a steal!Two 330ml cans of Tiger beer at $11 each (1/2 price due to happy hour) bought the total to just over $55 SGD - happy days.We told our server about this 'rip off' and he apologised and spoke to a person whom we presumed was the owner.He never came near us so all we can do is say do not go to this restaurant. It should be out of business shortly and hopefully something good will take its place

We were looking for a lunch spot along Clarke Quay after walking down from Fort Canning Park and decided to try Muchos.Our food was tasty, the beer cold and service prompt and friendly. A cool stop on the Singapore River after a long walk
4
We arrived at Clarke Quay after 10pm & we were happy to get a nice mexican meal here. It wasn't cheap being right on the riverfront but we all enjoyed our meal
3
Came here with my wife, child and mother tonight, we were in the mood for Mexican so decided to hit up the Clarke quay area. We had a decent meal, wife had chicken taco salad, mother had a chicken rice dish and I had the trio fajitas which was good. We all liked our meals, wasn't the greatest but decent for a Mexican spot. Also had the jalapeño poppers which were good and hot and the chips and guacamole for apps. We all had a drink as well. Only complaint would be the service was kind of slow but can't complain to much when you have at least a nice view of the water.
1
Food is industrial, doesn't look like on the menu and names are misleading (for example chipolata are not chipolata), no iced water but only expensive bottled water, etc... Avoid this place ! I should have guessed it was a tourist trap.
3
We visited this place last night after finished dinner. We just wanna stay out a little longer here on a clear sky without Haze. It was a mistake. We ordered a jug of frosty lime and chips to share. The Margarita was good. The chips came with 2 tablespoons of salsa. After 15 chips salsa is gone. We call one of waitress ask for more salsa. She said it will needed an extra charge. My hubby said to her that it's fine if the quantity is suitable and not 2 tbsp. A minute after waiter came and gave us 2.5 tbsp cup of salsa. My hubby said to him if you want to do this just bring the whole basket back.The same waiter came back with the proper size cup of salsa later. He slammed the cup on the table and walk away. All the tables around us turn their head to see this too. It was a big noisy slammed. My night was completely ruin by this guy. He definitely had a zero emotional intelligence. The rest of Phillipines staffs were good. But it had to be this guy to serve us at the time. To management : If you can't live with the price you charge us. Then increase the price with proper amount of sauce. Add EQ test before recruiting staffs too.
1
The food quality has gone down and the service is still as bad as it was earlier. So no more Muchos for me - I hope they do better as the customers deserve mor

Dinner with some colleagues at Mucho. Seating near the waterfront is nice, especially the water taxis passing by is lovely to watch. You can do this however from almost all restaurants near Clarke quay. Service overall is good, staff is attentive, food is what you can expect from a Mexican restaurant and okay.
3
Very agreeable Mexican restaurant in Clarke Quay. Food very good and service excellent. Might be picking on them for what may be a Singapore thing (oneupmanship?) but they only serve French mineral water. Not only awful for the Environment but also tasted terrible. And of course expensive.
5
When in Singapore my wife and I like to try different foods from different cultures and on our recent long weekend we were lucky to try out Muchos. Both of us had lovely meals and we will definitely be back for more on our next holiday
4
We tried the Nachos, Quesadillas and Fries at Muchos that night. The food was just great! Situated right at the heart of Clarke Quay, the ambience was just perfect. We chose to sit by river, and thankfully got a seat right at the edge. There was an offer on a magarita pitcher and we thoroughly enjoyed it! A pitcher was shared between 4 people, and made about 5-6 glasses
4
Service was really great. Food was good and come out fast and great location. Def worth a try if you're I'm the mood for Mexica
4
This is a great little place for a good meal well situated with some fantastic dishes. Great place to just relax have a beer or a glass of wine. The staff are friendly and the food is delicious, we were there on a Saturday and it was perfect. Enjo

Visited Muchos in early September whilst staying in Clarke Quay.Great location in Clarke Quay with both indoor seating and outside seating overlooking the river.Quite an extensive menu - I also noticed a children's menu was available. Pretty reasonably priced too for the area.The food was very good, and they adapted a dish for me do it wasn't too spicy! Reasonable portion sizes too - certainly no room for desert! Well worth a visit if Mexican is your thing!
5
Staff really fast, and service was very prof. The have a kids menu here, and all in all good mexi food for a fair pric
3
The food was Ok, however, for the serving sizes it is expensive. defintely tourist palce. Good service however
3
Conveniently located on Clark Quay and good for watching the tourists. Inside and outside seating available. Casual. Moderately priced for Singapore. Plenty of options and what I had was flavorful. Margarita taste great, so had two. Service was a little slow and had to walk to bar to get my bill so I could move on to my next venue
3
Good food and great location by the riverside. We ordered nachos but the salsa was too less. When we requested for more salsa, again the portion was less. Felt that this was overpriced and charging premium for the location.
5
Wow dine here really a very gud experience. Gud attitude sttaf. very tasty food ..sure come again..I like enchiladas .very tasty food. I love this place .
4
Enjoyed our arrival lunch here. This restaurant doesn't have any closing timings in the afternoon (main benefit for us) and the food was quite good, had flavour.. Especially the grilled chicken fajitas and enchiladas
5
We were in Singapore for a 2 days one night. ........... This is the restaurant at Clarke quay to have one of the best Mexican food .........staff was courtieous ..........service was quick if looking for good food .......... This is the place
4
On my own on a Sunday afternoon in Singapore. Stopped in around 5pm for a drink and to cool off after a long walk on a hot day, and stayed for dinner. Nice, cool place with good margaritas and nice people. Good ambience. Food was just OK. Not bad but not really very Mexican. Instead, it was an Asian version by someone that has never been to or near Mexico.Good for drinks and appetisers but I would pass on a meal next time...too many excellent places close by on Clarks Quay
1
A nice location on the bustling waterfront at Clark Quay, but our experience this week on our first visit was pretty awful. Our orders were taken quite quickly but it took about 30 minutes before the first of our orders were delivered to the table - a couple of diet cokes, and then food and drink for our group of 7 arrived at random intervals over a further 30 minutes so nobody got to eat together and some drinks didn't even arrive until after the food was finished. The quality of the food was poor, burritos that were mostly filled with flavourless rice and looked as though they had been wrapped by a monkey. Limp bits of leaf masquerading as a salad, etc. The french fries someone ordered looked quite nice and the portion was huge, but not sure you'd go to a Mexican restaurant for that. The combination of an over-stretched staff and inept kitchen and bar adds up to a terrible rating. We won't be going back to see if we were unlucky
1
Went there for lunch with my girlfriend. Was priced for $15 each, bill was $35,20. Shame about the false advertisement regarding prices. They also tried to overcharge by presenting the evening menu instead of the lunch menu. Had to get the other menu myself. The portions were tiny, the dessert was not even one full scope of ice a person. The dishes were okay in taste, not worth the money though.Note: even though it's a bar, there's no toilet around, the nearest public toilet is two blocks over.
2
Right on the river. Lovely views of the boats. Then there was the food. Typical chain, take the money but don't expect good service or food. Tiny portions and very indifferent staff. I am still at a loss to understand why we chose this place
4
Arrived very busy, was still seated in a timely manner, service was good but did struggle slightly with the crowded service.Food was very good, we decided to order a few smaller dishes for a bit of everything, that was thanks to the menu which had a lot of options.Overall was good, & will return when next in Singapor
3
Not a good place. Very average. We asked for veg burrito and were served something with chicken or prawn in it, which was replaced. This was on a day where we were one of only two tables occupied for lunch on a working day !! Was that an overworked chef!! And to boot we were charged the full amount - no discount or concessions for the goof up that happened. Don't think I will be going here willingly again
3
Descent Mexican food. Had chili corn with tortillas. It was good. But next time would rather go places with asian food since it is better and more authentic.
3
The food was a tad too oily for Mexican fare. The location is great and the seating options are nice too with great ambiance but the food was average.
5
Fabulous food. Lots of choice - especially for those who aren't' familiar with Mexican. For those who are, enjoy. Could have gone back more than once!
3
with the many food choices, not sure why I stepped into Muchos. The staff was efficient and polite however the food was a disappointment. There was just something lacking in the taste. Unfortunate as the location and staff were really nice.
4
We relished the excellently made Taco Salad & Quesadillas with drinks from amongst a varied range of cocktails & mocktails. Alongside the river sitting next to the railing at night is a pleasurable feeling.
3
set in a busy tourist area, we were hugry and this looked good. we shared a chicken nachos, which was fine. burrittos were not so good, hastily put together and lacking real flavour. this place seems to trade on the tourist market and doesn't want to try to entice anyone back. i had the strawberry cooler soft drink which cost over 10 dollars and was disgusting. needless to say we wont be back. feel sorry for the waiter though as he tried very hard to be attentive and friendly, but the food and drinks let this place down
2
Went to this place tonight. Had the chile con queso for entree......certainly was not creamy and cheesy like others I have had. I had chicken enchilada for main......what a mistake. Firstly, it wasn't hit enough, hadn't been microwaved long enough, there was minimal at best cheese on it and it was so very, very bland tasting. My partner had chicken fajitas and these were reasonable. The good thing was ice cold beer, and the staff were friendly. Do yourself a favour and eat at the other Mexican restaurants on the quay. I won't be back
3
We stopped on a whim at Muchos recently. It was mid week and we actually had a reservation elsewhere in Clarke Quay. The riverside table enticed us to stop in and it turned out very well. The customers we were entertaining enjoyed trying a "new" cuisine and even those who do not like spicy food were satisfied. Don't expect authentic Mexican dishes but you will get good atmosphere, decent service (we went mid week tho) buckets of cold beer and (if you keep your culinary expectations in check,) food that may feed your craving for Mexican food
5
This is one of the many restaurants that sits along the Singapore River, it is a bonus to secure a table close to the river and just enjoy the soothing sights and water. We enjoy this restaurant, good food, great ambiance and the margarita's are excellent. Highly recommen
5
It's become a real thing for me to try Mexican food whenever I go for holidays to compare, done that in Paris, Seoul, Dublin, England, Australia, Toronto, and a few more. I have to say that I was very impressed by the effort made by this place to capture the Mexican flavours. Nachos had real cheese, not that saucy orange plastic like thing called cheese sometimes. Guacamole made with real chunky pieces of avocado, sour cream and spicy mince beef. Tortillas were crunchy and absolute perfect in colour
3
food was ok but a bit over priced was a little crazy with loud music and customers everywhere, more like a bar than Resto. Service was friendly but hard to find. Nothing special just ok
1
Visited Muchos for dinner with family
Really stingy small meals, worst nachos we've ever had
Not sure the weird tasting "chicken" on Nachos was even meat
Expensive for size/ quality of meals
Give it a miss
3
We went to muchos last night.
Nice place and view, there are tables for smokers.
Service was good
Nice frozen margaritas
Food was average-good though it was a little pricy..
3
We stopped here for a drink before getting on the river boats. We decided to try their nachos because they looked good on the menu. They were very good. Try to get a table where there is a fan overhead. Ask the waiter to turn it on and they will be happy to do so. We are from a part of the U.S. where we have excellent Mexican food. The nachos did not disappoint us.
3
As with all of Singapore it seems you pay a lot and get whatever. Muchos was a comfortable, had tasty food but little customer service and was crazy expensive. It is in an area that is catering to a nightlife and at 5:30 the wait staff wasn't very attentive
3
I think we dined here twice for the location and price vs how great it was. The food and drinks here seemed to us to be a bit lower than most of the restaurants in the area, especially in happy hour… plus they have a large outdoor area with great views of the Quay. It's nothing personal but we found alcoholic drinks to be high everywhere in Singapore, including the liquor stores. Yikes! A half pint of beer averaged $14.50!Service was rather slow but friendly. There were large areas for each server to cover and there must have been too few servers. Our dinners here were good, but nothing to write home about. So for price, this restaurant offered good value and we'd return
4
We visited this with some young kids. The food was reasonable but not brilliant. Good for Mexican, prices reasonable and staff very friendly. Also they were happy to split meals between two for sharing, including soup. Nice location next to river. You can sit in air conditioned room if you like.
4
I agree with previous comments, we were delighted with our food.Nachos were plenty big enough to share between 2 & very spicy.My husband had food envy at the chicken burrito's, which looked amazing!The chicken quesadilla was fab.We managed 2 jugs of sangria & could have stayed longer for more had we not have been so tired on our first night in Singapore.River seats hard to get during the evening but great views across the river if you do get close
4
One of the waterside restaurants in Clark Quay so the view is outstanding. Their food was really tasty too. Good size portions. Staff was friendly and helpful. Only downside to watch...with this one or any other restaurant in Singapore, is beer or liquor is insanely priced. Not the restaurant's fault. Taxes.We had a chicken tostada, taco salad, and ONE half price "Happy Hour" pitcher of Margaritas. $86. $50 of that was the booze....and it was half off to boot. Clearly the govt doesn't like people drinking or perhaps they're just making a ton on the tax
5
Probably one of the best chicken burritos I've had, very big and very tasty - with jalapeños and cheese as extras. Staff were friendly. Cocktails were $18 - but it's Clarke Quay, so expect to be ripped off with drinks....one comment, the wifi password for outside was not for customers....but after asking a few waiters one of them gave me 'the restaurants' password (when the manager turned his back) weird that a restaurant in a major tourist area doesn't have wifi for its customers. Otherwise excellent :
5
Based in Clarke Quay by the riverside, very friendly staff and the food was really delicious. They have happy hours and regular promos. If you like hot spicy Mexican food, you won't fall short here.
3
A group of eleven of us visited Muchos for dinner. The waitstaff were helpful and friendly and more than happy to welcome our group. The portion sizes were small but the prices were well priced for Clarke Quays. The drinks are ok priced.My partner and I ordered the Beef enchilada (very small size for price, nice tasting beef) and beef nachos (tasty, ok size to share). As a couple we probably wouldn't go again if we wanted real Mexican, but is a good choice for large groups with fussy eaters
5
Really surprised to read all the scathing reviews about this place! We stopped in today for a late lunch around 2pm. We sat outside right by the water which was lovely with a cool breeze. Most places were completely dead at this time but there were a handful of busy tables at Muchos so that caused it to catch our attention amongst the plethora of options in the vicinity. I had a frozen mango margarita which was delicious although I couldn't taste the tequila at all. I ordered chicken tacos and my partner had the chicken fajitas. The food was so good, really fresh and spicy. The service was fast and polite and the prices really reasonable
2
We had lunch here in late December. Food was very forgettable. We had eaten at Iguanas (other side of the river) a couple of days before and the food there was absolutely miles better than Muchos - presentation, flavour, freshness, lack of greasiness, size of meal, just everything really.We had two kids with us - the kids meals that arrived were poor, I felt guilty letting them eat them they were just piles of thin gooey cheese with ZERO vegetables.Avoid

Arrived late on a saturday afternoon. Order a chilled SOL beer ....had a sip only to find out that the beer was not chilled. Told the staff to replace and they said they couldn't. ...but gave me an ice Bucket to chill it.Order chicken minced nachos and chicken fajitas.....food was bland and not tasty at all.Would not recommend this place to anyone.....

This was surely one of the worst ever experience I have had in Singapore and it clearly ruined my birthday dinner. My wife and I wanted some nice mexican food and ended up at Muchos, Clarke quay. We had just one bite of our starters, when one of their careless waiters, after clearing out the dishes from another table, dropped the tray right next to our table, with the entire bowl of salsa sauce splattering onto my wife's dress. I do understand these things happen, but the way the waiters handled it appalled me. My wife clearly wanted to clean herself first and got up to go the restroom. But Muchos doesn't have one and the nearest public restroom was around 200m away. So I gathered our things to accompany my wife to the restroom and told them we would return shortly. But still the waiter in charge demanded me to leave my credit card. Who does that? In spite of all that happened, they were not one bit sorry, instead was wanting some deposit. Remember only one of our dishes was served and we had just started to eat. We refused to present our credit cards and started to walk towards the restroom. And you won't believe what happened next. One of their waiters followed us all the way to the restroom, claiming to be sorry, but just to be sure that we return back to the restaurant. He even waited outside the restroom along with me, until my wife cleaned herself up. We didn't want to create any scene and thought we will just finish our dinner and leave quickly. On returning back, we found our table and food exactly the way it was just before we left. No sorry again and no efforts to make up for their mistake. The food had turned cold and we did not enjoy it one bit. We had no other option but force ourselves to finish the food. (We really try not to waste food.) We had ordered the chimichangas and the outer covering was too oily. Anyways, we quickly finished the dishes, called for the bill and quickly ran out of the place. The worst service quality and careless attitude of the waiters' (even when the mistake was on their part) is what really forced me to write this review. Advice for management if you are reading this:Please ensure your staff is well trained to handle such situations. Mistakes can happen, but one has to own up and do what is right to ensure the customers feels better at the end of the day.Your staff was acting very cold and indifferent to us and I will never forget this experience. I for sure won't recommend this place to anyone and will in fact try to persuade them not to go to any of the Muchos restaurants, in case they plan to

I love asian food but after eating it for 10 days we needed a change. We were staying in Orchard rd and found it really difficult to find a restaurant only food courts.We had passed Clarke Quay on the hop on hop off bus so thought we would give it a try for dinner as the selection of bars & restaurants was amazing.We walked up and down the quay a few times and kept coming back to Mucho's. We were not disappointed the food was really good, atmosphere excellent being right on the river watching the sights. Service was great and the corona's were cold. Would defiantly return

Greeted with an almost dizzying array of food, if you appreciate the differences between your burrito, tortilla, quesadilla, fajita or chimichanga, then I think this might be the place for you.Otherwise, trying to determine which type of wrap to eat may be a little confusing.Understandably with a big party (of about 10 of us), the food came at different times, but sadly no attempt at all was made to try and some of the food was cold or eaten by the time the last order arrived.The food itself was tasty, but nothing mind blowing

On Thursday October 23rd my family (2 nieces, sister-in-law, husband and 9months old daughter) and I went for lunch to Plaza Singapura and decided to try mexican food at Muchos. Our biggest mistake ever!!!!Already while entering the restaurant we found the 3 waiters on the bar looking at their mobiles and took them some minutes to decide who should stop that and take us to a table.After being seated we waited for a while but nobody was coming so I stood up and asked for the menu... We should have left then straight away!!We ordered the lunch menu starter+main dish although before getting my salad I was surprised to get my main dish, fajitas. The waiter placed the fajita table with the pan with the meat in front of me without saying anything and before I knew my 9 month old daughter that was sitting next to me in a high chair grab the plate. Worst moment of my life ever!!! I quickly stood up and took her little hand inside my icetea as was the only cold thing i had next to me. She was crying so loud.Despite of all of that nobody came to us.I ran to the bar tender that was the only one around and asked for ice and cream for burns and he looked at me puzzled as if I was crazy. He did not even moved from where he was and just looked at other waiters that were going out from the kitchen.I asked my husband to run to the shops and get some medicine while I added Sudocrem to her hand.When I saw the waiter that placed the hot plate without warning in front of me i told her what she did and then another waiter came with ice and a cream.It took more than 30 min till i calmed down my baby and she felt sleep.In all that time only one of they waiters was there for us and gave us the details of the restaurant manager and so on.The day after I got a phone call from the manager of the restaurant checking if they could do anything for us. No, nothing could be done for us anymore as I could already see the blisters of my babies hand but I requested her to get her staff trained. I would imagine that is natural in human beings to worry when you hear a baby crying in pain but this was not the case for the staff in that restaurant. While i was putting my babies burnt hand in ice the waitress was behind us asking for who had the rest of the orders!!! Really crazy!!!I am now just worried about other babies going to this restaurant and having the same thing.... Hot plates placed in front of them without warning and no reaction when first aids are really needed. I really hope the manager takes control of her staff and trains them accordingly

As a regular visitor to Singapore, by regular I mean 100 business trips in the last 7 years. I had always walked past this restaurant in Clarke Quay. However on an extended stay I was tiring of my usual eating establishments and thought I'll try something different. In short I should have walked past Muchos!! Very unimpressed with food and the staff. Will not eat here again!
3
Food was great. Spicy as it should be. Service was a bit unfocused though. I can definitely recommend this restaurant if you like Mexican food. The atmosphere in the evening are great.
5
Food and drink is awesome.
Bit pricey but so worth it. Next time I am in Singapore definitely going back.
4
Didn't have my hopes up but it was the only decently prices place near the water with mexican food. We had two excellently cooked steaks and nachos with coke, adding up to about S$120. Very friendly staff and over all a plesant experience.

Located in an enviable position (next to the river and Hooters!) in Clarke Quay, we visited Muchos on a Sunday evening and sat outside next to the river (nice seating area).All of the menu sounded good and we ended up ordering veggie quesadillas and beef tostados - and based on the the previous reviews and our food tonight, I think how you rate this place comes down to the luck of the draw and what you actually ordered. My companion's Beef tostados looked & tasted really good (although they could have done with more spice / flavour). However my veggie quesadillas were the worst I have ever had in any Mexican restaurant anywhere- so greasy, thin and generally nasty, with the minimal cheese pretty much liquidified - pic enclosedSo I had a bad meal, my companion had a good meal - all in all, an average place (service was good though and the meals came out quick) - these two dishes, one coke and a side of rice came to Â£23 / 46 SGP, including service & ta
2
Based on our experience.. everything about this place is "so-so" only. From service to food. Food serve was not fresh. Nachos we bought from supermarket tasted much better. Restaurant was full.. we were seated in front of the bar for 15 mins while waiting for our table and nobody asked if we would like a drink ..Waiters/Waiteresses.. walking like they are in cloud nine.. not looking around. As we were at a corner.. it was difficult to get their attention. Definitely will not go there again.

Terrible restaurant, don't go here! It was a nice night and we wanted to have some dinner. We were in for some Mexican food, so chose Muchos. We were seated outside, on the platform near the water. So far, so good.It took a while before a waiter came to take our drink orders and bring the menus. After this we had to wait 30 minutes (!), before we were able to get a waiter to our table again. We hadn't received our drinks yet, and had to order them again. We also ordered our food. The drinks came after another 15 minutes, but the food didn't. After 45 minutes we asked for the status of our food, and apparently our order didn't come through. This was the second time in one night! We ordered again and this time the food came about 10 minutes later.The quality of the food was poor. The portions were small and it didn't taste that good.When the check came, they had the guts to automatically add the service charge. It wasn't possible to remove it from the bill, so I had to pay for 'service' I didn't receive. It was awefull.Summary: awful service, pricy and poor food. If you somehow want to go here, be prepared for a long evening with ordering your food multiple times before getting some

We went to Muchos for a late lunch/early dinner so we were there before the crowds and it was very quiet. Sitting on the river was very pleasant and relaxing. The seating was comfortable The staff were friendly, polite and helpful. Our food arrived promptly and was delicious
1
I had a taco salad that cost quite a lot, was very small, had a tiny sprinkling of cheese. Less than ordinary. Didn't even taste very fresh. I remarked to the staff and they were dismissive. The guacamole did not taste homemade and was an unnatural green color that made me think it was brightened with preservatives and coloring. Margarita was so-so. I see everyone raves about their burritos on tripadvisor, so maybe I just had the wrong thing. However, a good guacamole is basic necessity for Mexican restaurants
1
Second-third rate Mexican food that doesn't really taste Mexican.There's really no reason to go here, especially as just across the way is one the best Mexican places in Singapore.We wouldn't have been this down on the fact that they charge for water if the food was ok, but it's just not.Strictly a tourist trap
4
Its actually in Plaza Singapura (Dhoby Ghaut MRT). I went here for lunch on a weekday. I guess we are the first customer during that time. We ordered nachos (for share) and 3 orders of their lunch combo meals. It goes with a soup, drinks, and an option of either burrito, quesadillas, or chili con carne w/ spinach rice (not so sure with the last one).It just cost us 49sgd overall. It is probably cheap, but its because we ordered the combo meals.But if you go for ala carte, it is definitely too pricey. I will have to compare it with Chillis (my all time fave), and just as for a glass of margarita, Muchos is much expensive. The food taste good- it is comparable to Chillis and Baja Fresh. Serving size is a little less though. Bottom line, its my Top 3. Top 1 remains Chillis and Baja Fresh on 2nd spot
4
Even if it is not an authentic mexican restaurant the food is quite good. It's very cheap compared to the Singapore average. The service is efficient.
3
The seating outside is great due to the fanstastic view of water under lights.
The Mexican food was good and the staff was polite. However not too sure about the scost....
2
Visited this restaurant with friends. We just wanted a snack so order a sharing platter. The quality of the food was poor everything covered in batter or breadcrumbs. Not very tasty and not very inspiring.
1
Overpriced, over spiced and a poor attempt at Mexican food. We have eaten Mexican food all over the world, even in Mexico and nowhere have we been so totally disappointed. To be positive, at least they can only improve. As for the pricing, two partially eaten dishes, a Corona, a Pina colada and no change out of $85, a total let down
1
I love Mexican food, but I generally avoid Clarke Quay. As such, somehow I had never ended up at Mucho's but after a recent recommendation, I decided to give it a try (furthermore, Margarita's on Dempsey was booked solid). I should have stayed away. Mucho's was a mucho disappointment. First the servers try to hustle you. When our frozen margaritas arrived, I actually had to call the waiter to check if by mistake he had brought us some non-alcoholic margaritas, as I could not taste any alcohol in it. I was further alarmed when our fajita orders arrived within a minute of ordering. It wasn't great but the biggest disappointment was the chicken chimichanga - always my gold standard in judging Mexican restaurants. Mucho's does a slight variant where they cut the burritos into smaller pieces before refrying and the cheese is just at the edges - rather than covering the whole burrito. I thought that this innovation meant that I have an innovative chef and the chimichanga was going to be great. However, it turned out to be one of the worst I have ever had - with completely dry fillings of chicken. A must to avoid
3
Family of four (a toddler and a baby) had dinner here. Pretty much the only place at Clark quay where you didn't have to wait in line (it was a Friday though so not sure if it's always like this). Food was good. Decent servings. Don't forget about all the extra service charges and tax etc when ordering cos it may suprise you when you get the bill.
2
We were hungry… So we picked up this place, hoping that we will be served a great meal. Not lucky ! It was not the case ! It was not very good, quiet simple, too spicy and not very tasty. And on the top ? Very pricy - 100$ per 2 (3 plates to share, two coke and 1 bottle of water ?!?). Definitively to avoid..
1
The food here is the worst we came across in Singapore. Mostly deep fried tasteless muck. We had the platter for two and the stuffed jalapeños. Clarke quay is your complete throat trap when it comes to dining. Looks nice on the outside but food isn't up to standards. Avoid at all costs unless your into the touristy stuff and don't really care about what your eating.
2
The only plus point of Muchos is it's location, it's got great outdoor seating by the river. But that's about it - the food is tasteless, they even manage to mess up Nachos - the cheese sauce tastes like it's been squeezed out of a can, and the roasted vegetables are greasy. Add to this, the prices here and it's pretty much a lose-lose situation. The food here leaves much to be desired
2
Tourist location. Cheap and fried food - we had the sharing platter. For those Brits who read this, it was like the poorer end 2F1 chain public house food. Service pleasant - I don't the the staff for the lack of food quality. Owners / management need to step up. There's a massive choice of better quality cheaper food in the neighbourhood. We won't return
2
If you are after barely mediocre Mexican food in a nice location, then this is your place. Prices were consistent with the area, so you don't feel entirely ripped off ... but if you miss Mexican food, your stomach won't thank you.
4
I went to Muchos with my friends recently.Food was good.Yummy and worth the price. I really loved the ambience.Staff was very friendly.
Must-go place
4
enjoyed a meal at the quay overlooking the river. Service was excellent, meals came out within 10 minutes, meals were of good quality, little expensive overall for food and beverages but this is Singapore in general. Would go their again.
2
The place is convenient but nothing more. The food is a bland imitation of real Mexican food and overpriced at that.
4
Unlike previous reviewers we thought the food here (typical Mexican fare) was good. Clarke Quay is a touristy area and the prices are on the high side, but we enjoyed our meal, liked the riverside location and had a delightful waitress who could not have been more helpful
2
I was hoping for a nice Mexican dinner - especially at a restaurant in Clarke Quay where prices are higher and there is a lot of competition.The food came out fast - faster than my drink! But to be honest the food was very bland and overall the service was friendly, but very slow.Definitely won't be going back
3
32 SD for a chilli con carne and small beer (and that at supposedly happy hour prices) is just taking the Mickey. I'll give them 3 stars for the quality of the food, but won't be returning. Even if they chucked in some fresh chopped chillies to up the heat. Contrary to some previous posts, the wifi works fine outdoors, and there are at least 12 tables where you can smoke
3
We were looking for a late night dinner, while walking along Orchards... This place was open and looked nice.The setting was ok (We dined outside on one of the only 3 smoking allowed tables), soi was the service (no mistake in the orders, fast and attentive but not very warm) and little overpriced but this I can't really confirm... I stayed only 3 days in Singapore and it was the 1st time.The Deep Fried Squid rings were cold on arrival and smoochy... The Mexican steak was good and properly cooked and the wine was ok but a expensive for the average grade (once again, it might be the rule in Singapore)So yes, if you're looking for a casual dinner on the way and late at night (10.15) it's not a bad choice
1
I was really disappointed with Muchos. The view is amazing however the food and service are awful. We ordered Nachos to start with but considering the size of the plate they were a bit stingy with the toppings. The main dishes were even worse. I ordered the veggie burrito and as soon as I started cutting into it, it was really watery. It seems the chef did not drain the water from the vegetables. The food was bland and tasted of nothing. We ordered a side dish ($8/9) of chilli chips and the portion size of this was for four people and there were only two of us so most of this went to waste. So only order this if there are more than two of you as the staff do not tell customers about strange portion sizes for side dishes.The staff seem to stand around talking so when we were trying to leave it was difficult to get their attention to pay the bill. Note service charge and tax are included in the bill. We asked for the WiFi password but one of the waitresses said it only works inside the restaurant... we were sitting outside. There are so many places to eat in Clarke Quay that I wouldn't bother with Muchos. Muchos does not offer good quality food and is definitely not value for money.
4
We celebrated a big birthday and enjoyed the food and the Marguaritas very much. It was hot even though we were right by the river.It was expensive but we misread the price of the wine when we ordered it, so watch out for that. A good night was had by all
2
This place is very well located in the heart of Clarke Quay, one of the most popular and lively places in Singapore for late evening fun. It hosts plethora of bars & restaurants to dine at by the bay. So, we discovered this bar, with descent ambiance, overlooking the quiet waters. We were happy to find a place, in the mid of all fun-fair, with no waiting queue and decided to give it a try. We soon had another discovery to make, as to why there wasn't queue, when all other bars in the are are so packed up. The service standards are poor. We had to wait for 10 mins to locate somebody who can share the menu and pick the order. We ordered a few beers, nachos and burritos, which would follow good 20 mins after that. Thanks to the beers, our day was saved. Nachos were tasteless, and burritos were too dry and chewy. I hate wasting food, but this time it was test of my patience and I lost it soon. We left the place soon, to never visit again
1
This was the worst Mexican restaraunt I have been to across the Globe. I would never go there again. It's hard to screw up Nachos but they did. Service was poor and they ran out of the beer we were drinking. They also think their food is a premium by the prices they were charging. I understand it is in a tourist area and the ambiance is nice but I don't think they even know how to spell Mexican much less make the food. Very disappointe
3
We went to Muchos last night and had an enjoyable time although very little of that had to do with the restaurant. A very nice location and some of the servers were friendly while others were pretty much rude.We ordered frozen margaritas (which were great), nachos (which were small and uninspiring) and burritos (which were decent enough although they got my order wrong) and paid a pretty penny. I don't think I'd go back here unless I was dying for frozen margarita
4
Return visit, Sunday lunchtime, 2 -3 table in useExcellent frozen lime margarita but they have stopped the pitcher of cocktail offer at lunchtimes which is a shame.Also no longer get free chips/dip on arrivalGood food, not quite what orderedLarge portions.Typical service for Singapore standard
4
Good food, at reasonable cost. If you would want to take a break from local Asian cuisine, I guess this is the right place. I enjoyed the chimichanga I had here. Tasty and the serving is quite generous. What adds more to this place is it being situated by the river. The right place to chill out on a Friday night after a week long business trip
1
Went to the Plaza Singapura outlet with a friend. Since this was a pre-dinner snack, we ordered a Muchos platter and 2 beers. Service was quick but serving size was small considering that the platter was advertised to be for 2 persons. For $30, we got 2 small drum sticks, 2 small mid-joints, a small handful of tortilla chips, 6-8 calamari rings and 4 pieces of beef quesadilla and 3 mid-sized shrimp on a skewer! The wings were colder than room temperature and only slighter warmer than the beer. The beef in the quesadilla tasted like bland rubber and probably was just taken out from the fridge and the shrimp was tasteless as well. Fortunately, we had the beer to wash everything down but I'm definitely not going back again
2
I came here for dinner and I got a lime margarita (do not take it, it is really 99% of lime and only one or two drops of tequila, so it is a waste of money), nachos and some tacos. I love mexican food, but this was not really mexican, it was something else and not really good. Plus it was quite expensive
1
We'd been past this restaurant at Plaza Singapura a few times and it looked good, so we enquired about the vegetarian selection - they provided a long list. So, last Friday evening we headed over for a family meal.Our waiter was vey good, he explained that most of the vegetarian dishes were NOT suitable for vegetarians as they had been / or were going to be cooked with / side by side or in the same oils as the meat and fish etc. BIG disappointment.He suggested three dishes that were suitable - veg fajitas, veg nachos and veg quesadilla. SO we ordered one of each and some drinks.Every dish had the same veg, a few slices peppers, a few chunky slices of what looked like courgettes and loads and loads of onions! The fajitas came with three sauces/dips - a tomato salsa, sour cream and about half a tea spoon of guacamole - none of it resembled the pictures on the menu! When we asked about the miserly amount of guacamole - we were told that is it - but we could pay for more...eventually they agreed to give us at least enough to fill the very small sauce dish. Drinks were OK.The food was not good, have had better nachos at the cinema! The veg fajitas were truly awful, unless you love onions!Would not recommend this place to eat. But maybe a good place, given its location, for a drinks and a quick snack when meeting friends etc
1
Service was bad, expensive, doesn't include water - apparently you have to buy a bottle, they don't normally serve water. They brought glasses out after we complained. Food doesn't come with beans or rice or cheese. Right across the river is CafeIguana which is better quality food and worth a visit. We definitely won't be back
2
Very poor representation of Mexican food by any standard. We had fajitas for main, the amount of meat was so small it was pathetic, the totilas were so baked dry they were more like crispy spring rolls than bread, and the salsa portions etc. were very poor. the food came very quickly after ordering so this is obvoiusly food that sits waiting for its customers rather than cooked to order. A poor experience and poor food, definately one to avoid. The service was indifferent but not noticably bad.I will certainly not be spending my money there again
4
Three of us really enjoyed the Lunch Special at Muchos Bar & Restaurant. The soup (potato and mushroom) could have been a little warmer, but it was tasty. Our mains (Vege Nachos, Chicken Nachos and Fajitas) were great, as was the high-quality icecream for dessert. Our Cokes were all part of the $15.00 Special... with nothing added-on for tax. Considering the amazing location and excellent service, S$45 for that kind of lunch for three is outstanding value. Muchas gracias, Muchos
4
If we'd read the other reviews first we wouldn't have gone to Muchos based on the negative feedback. Maybe we were just lucky, but we really enjoyed it. The service was friendly and efficient - we were worried food would take ages because they were so busy, but it arrived quickly. The food was by no means authentic Mexican, but it was tasty! We had guacamole, chicken fajitas and chicken enchiladas. Others have complained about the terrible drinks but our Sangria was great
5
Location of the restaurant was great as you were surrounded by the hustle and bustle of Clark Quay and river views. This restaurant provided high quality customer service and food. The food arrived quickly and the waiting staff were very attentive in particular. Overall this restaurant offered an excellent dining experience
3
Overpriced but really lovely service (Hazel) with great view of the river and boat watching to keep the kids occupied. I have read other reviews when the food has been disappointing but tonight was ok. Generous portions with plenty of chicken and salad with the burrito. Kids meals came out quickly but were overpriced for corn chips with grilled cheese on top. Having said this the kids ate the lot!Hazel even offered to take a family photo which was lovely
5
After long time i visited singapore with four of my friends, someone recommended from the hotel ,this restaurant serves good mexican food, we were not at all disppointed , we loved all the food what they served us , also the mexican beer too was good. one thing i would add on that they have good variety of food .as well as the nice outdoor sitting along the river , they were so busy still the service was decent & quick , so it was a delicious mexican journey for us, if we are again singapore ,we would visit again :

We had dinner at this restaurant a couple of weeks ago on our last night in Singapore. Although the place was packed, a table was immediately made clear for us with awesome views up and down the river. There were a couple of small communication problems with our waiter who had trouble understanding our english and we ended up with a plate of chips that were not ordered (but we were in a foreign country after all, and our daughter devoured them, so no complaints really). We ordered a serve of beef nachos and chicken burritos to share, beer, wine and a lemonade for our daughter). Food came out promptly, portion sizes were perfect for us (but we are not huge eaters) and the food was awesome! Yes, the alcohol was very expensive, but all of the places along Clarke Quay charge the same crazy prices. Food prices were a little expensive, but compare them to what you would pay in Australia and it is comparable. Overall, a very pleasant experience

The review by Fantastic Food” Apr 8, 2013 bhavika81 surely must have reviewed wrong restaurant, or works this or one if the 3 other by same in area that serve food of Indian,Thai along same Singapore River @ Clarke Quay. This place was the worst Mexican food i have ever eaten & agree with “Seriously the worst Mexican food ever”Apr 1, 2013 SunJunkieMkWe were starving and had not long arrived in Singapore and wanted to grab something quick to eat in Clarke Quay. We were extremely disappointed with the drinks,incredibly overpriced as only Non alcoholic Although to be fair all drinks in Singapore are overpriced, generally found in past that SIngapore was renowned for being good food & service. Guess top tourist locations are a rip off world wide,seems this no different. We ordered Chicken Enchilada & Taco (never have I been more grateful not to have ordered a starter!) portion so small chicken almost no existent & sauce on enchilada well straight tabaco sauce I think,was so greasy and lacked any kind of Mexican flavour & Taco well like dried out CC chips with well not much else!! The service was slow to get started & drink order stuffed up then had to ask again, food came out quick though, not quality I expect when I am paying high prices for terrible food! Avoid eating here,if you like mexican food as only thing going for this place is it's location, next night ate little bar serves light mexican snacks in heart of Clarke near persian restaurant, food & drink tasted & priced way better & much cheaper
2
The only thing great about this place is that it is located in Clark Quay. Food was mediocre, drinks were laughable. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri, I was not able to taste the alcohol at all or even the strawberry flavor, tasted like slight flavored water. I talked to the waiter about it and he said they use one shot and that it is silver Bacardi and that's why I can not taste it. After we received our meals we did not see our waiter for the rest of the night and had the hunt down someone to give us our check. 2 entrees, 1 appetizer, 1 jug of beer, 1 lousy daiquiri for $150.. RIP OFF
4
Although the staff was great and the area along the river is very enjoyable, the food was average. I had the chicken fajitas. The portion was just right for one. Don't think you can feed two with this like you can in the USA. There's a 10% and a 7% = 17% tax added that goes to the government so food is very expensive. Caution, it is very spicy. I think it's the salsa but the chicken has attitude as well.
4
Ate here for Lunch twice. Food was so good we had to go back. Both times I had the burritos and it was great. We also got come chips and salsa which was also very good and spicy. We had great service by a very friendly waitress. Good place to hang out and eat outside on a nice afternoon. We had fun. Would definitely go back
3
We went in as it seemed very busy. The location was great and service was good however the food average. Was ok priced considering location in Clarke Quay.
5
This place was by far one of the best Mexican food i have ever eaten. The service food and drink was impeccable! I highly recommend this place!
2
Average Mexican food and poor service. We went there with friends for a night out while in town. Nachos were average, Chimichanga too. Chicken in the farita was so so. Nothing famous.
Price was a bit high but this is Singapore and especially Clarke Quay...
3
Great location, friendly waitress - food average and not cheap. Great location right on Clarke Quay.We had slow braised pork ribs which worked out to be approximately £21.00 and for the amount you were given felt this was expensive. Chicken Fajitas were average quality and cost approximately £15.00. This was our last evening in Singapore so I was a little dissapointed
1
DO NOT GO! Worse service, worse drinks, and food I have ever had. I complained about a drink and the waiter did not care at all. I sent back the drink and asked to speak to the manager and it took her at least an hour to come and see us. I asked for the manager at least three times before she finally came and she did not care at all. We had a discussion about the bad drinks and food. When we asked about the service charge she said it was a tax and not a service charge.We ended up paying for drinks that were not drinkable and food that was lous
3
The location is very lively, the seating arrangement is very congested and the cutlery given wasn't clean. The staff is very friendly and they changed it promptly. The only best part I came across was they have veg in their menu and the preparations were jus ok
2
We were starving and had not long arrived in Singapore and wanted to grab something quick to eat and thought this looked quite a nice restaurant with a good location in Clarke Quay. We were extremely disappointed with the drinks initially which were incredibly overpriced which we soon realised was typical of Singapore! The food therefore was even more shocking, having heard that SIngapore was renowned for being good. We both ordered Chicken fajitas (never have I been more grateful not to have ordered a starter!) as it arrived barely sizzling and was so greasy and lacked any kind of Mexican flavour. The service was slow too and we had to walk to the public toilets to use the bathroom - not what I expect when I am paying high prices for terrible food! Avoid if you like flavour, service, good value or anything not swimming in oil! The best thing going for this place is it's location - not a great advert for a restaurant
1
I had a dinner up there during my last stay in Singapore. Location is great, there are no doubts about it, but this is where all the advantages end. I asked the waiter if the prawns were spicy, he said they were slightly peppery. I wouldn't call breathing out the fire "slightly peppery". Apart from being spicy the food was just simply not nice. The staff was quite rude. They also have a tendency to walk away with your drink before you even finish. Don't go there! There much more better places with better prices and nice service
2
The restaurant location is wonderful as it is right outside of Plaza Singapura with inside and outside space. This may be a good place to have a gathering with colleagues on a Friday night to wind down the week with drinks. The food however was a huge huge dissapointment. As an example, the chicken burrito was $18 SGD and it was 50% rice and 50% chicken inside the medium sized buritto. The presentation was good and it looked appetizing but don't be charging so much for low quality food! The service was decent though, friendly staff and quick service
2
Service was maybe too tired to be nice and welcomingFood came almost cold No real taste ...too bad for those who love mexican A good tip pass your way and walk few hundred meters further the other side of the bridge is the iguana : enjoy the margarita 
4
Great location next to quay. Food very good and proper chicken for a change! Well worth a visit and not too expensive for singapore.
4
Had a great lunch at this restaurant. The food was delicious, atmosphere just right for a Mexican restaurant...not sure why everyone seems to have had such a negative experience-we had a great time!
2
too expensive, slow staff, average food, and noise and noise and noise
after some times in Singapore Clark Quay is for me an no go tourist trap area
1
never order the mexican rice- its white rice with spinach on it, It made me sick for 3 days. i got food poisoning. will never go back there again.
1
Our food came out only five minutes after ordering however it was obvious that the food was far from fresh and had simply been heated and then served, hence the 'fast service'. Who knows how long it had been prepared for! The chicken in our enchilada was so dry that it had texture that resembled straw. The beef in our fajitas was singed charcoal black and extremely dried out and the tortillas were so hard they couldn't even be folded. For food that tasted horrid it was ridiculously overpriced ($90 for three meals) and I would not recommend anyone waste their money or a meal here
1
We went to Muchos for lunch on a rainy Friday afternoon. We were the only people in the restaurant and the service was still atrocious. The staff didn't interact or take drinks orders for a while. The food was quite bland and tasteless. While they have a specific kids menu, the items were quite limited and it was cheaper to order from the adults menu for my 2 kids and them to share. For eg. the kids nachos cost $9.50 and only had chips and cheese, while the adults nachos cost $15 and included beef, beans, sour cream and guacamole on the chips and the serving was large enough for 2 kids. We also ordered enchilada's which had no flavour (other than chilli) and it was piled on a plate with one lettuce slice as salad. Overall, I would not recommend it as the food is expensive, tasteless and the service horrible. There are too many other great choices in the area to waste a meal at Muchos

We came here twice over the few days we were in Singapore. The staff are friendly and the food is tasty and was served to us quickly!Only worry is the price which is not cheap at all, but alot of places in Clarke Quay have a mark up like that

Went to the new location on Dec. 26, 2012. We had two strawberry margaritas and a plate of beef nachos. The margaritas were small and had sugar around the glass rim not salt as it should be. The nachos were on a small plate and not so good, The total bill was 54.95 sing. Will neve go back!! Also had no high chair for our son

Loud music-hey let's overeasy on the screaming kid. Air-con coooold! Menu selection? 'That's off, and that- off?' It sure is. We were victims, at their new venue at Singapura plaza. Not exactly busy. Too many staff. We ordered Nachos & Guacomala to start -(SGD$8.90) You don't get cream dip with it as any normal Mexican f&b, you have to order as add on. (SGD$3) We did. Scones anyone?  And the chips - yep not Nachos, not even bag standard Doritos. These Are POOR, not warm, no flava and cut your tongue! We then started to order the main. Snapper & Fish Fillet both off. Why? The Supervisor told me, they had been ordered by powers that be it was not up to pass level?? Go Figure...At this we declined our table and left. Thanks Groupon

I've been there yesterday with my girlfriend. We spendt 83 dollars for some chips and 2 burritos. Ok the location is Clark Quey, that means it's normal if the prices are so high, but the food quality and the service were very bad. I mean the tortilla chips served with a no taste sauce, we had to ask bottles for dress up by our own. To be honest if you have to eat some tortilla and chili sauce, go in the Iguana Bar, close to the JUMBO SEA FOOD, where with a drink they serve for free tortilla chips!!! 10times better than the Muchos's ones. What about the rest? wros Burrito ever ate in my life. I mean, I think if I'll buy a packaged one in the 7/11 for 5dollars it might be much better.... No way, avoid this place if you can. There are a lot of better places. 2 points just for the location. ADIOS!!

We had some pretty good food here. They were big servings and good value I thought. A nice outside setting along the riverbank.

Huge on cost, low on flavour and atmosphere.
Bland food, tepid beer.I would say give it a miss. I had better Mexican in Paris

We sat inside in the aircon - the decor was lovely. Outside seats are also fantastic with a great view of the river.
The service was excellent. The magaritas were superb. The food was wonderful.
Couldn't fault the restaurant at all.

i don't blame the waiter, because accidents happen... but i managed to get 2 glasses full of cocktails spilled directly all over me .. this included being covered by shards of smashed glassthe staff rushed over to offer napkins to clean up, and a band-aid to fix the blood streaming out of my cut fingerthe reason i'm giving a bad rating isn't because of the spillage (or the injury).. i don't blame the waiter at all as it was clearly an accident .. but the fact that if i was at any other restaurant IN THE WORLD: i would have at east got the replacement drinks for free... or maybe an offer of a reduced bill to cover the fact that now i had to clean all my clothes and put up with a bleeding sore hand... but no... were we charged the full amount for the already extremely overpriced substandard meal and plus plus (singaporean for plus service plus gst) .. plus $6 for extra guacamole...when i complained that this is weird... they said they would like to give us a discount but they had already put it through the system!!??!?! when i expressed even more disbelief one staff offered us a free 2 dollar icecream for desert i think they thought i was just another tourist so it wasn't worth being nice because i probably wasn't potential repeat business.. well.. wrong about the tourist thing, although i'm definitely not potential repeat business any more$75SGD for 1 nachos with extra chips and guacamole and 2 drinks!so.. my review: liars, overpriced, average food, terrible service, greedy people and terrible customer relations ..

The setting for this restaurant is quite good with some outdoor, but covered seating almost overhanging the river at Clarke Quay.Plenty of activity to look at whilst waiting to be served.The service was initially quick, however , after asking for the bill at the end of the meal there was an unacceptable delay, The establishment was not busy as it was early evening and I was the only one in the outdoor area. To make maters worse they took the money and the bill and were another 10 mins or more, before they returned with the change. I had to prompt them to return. In general the waiters etc seemed to spend a lot of time talking to each other rather than seeing to customer requirements. They were pleasant and polite when they did speak to youThe food was good although the chilli con carne portion was quite small and did not contain much meat.I had the Chilli and a scoop(small again) of Ice Cream and two fruit Juices. This came to S$39.90.I don't think I would hurry back. There was no atmosphere, but to be fair it was early evening and it may get better later into the nigh

Our family of four had dinner here recently for a birthday celebration. While the location along the river is nice, the service was slow and the food average. The staff were not interested in the diners and provided only a cursory greeting before chatting amongst themselves. The nachos was bland and uninteresting with extra charges for standard toppings. Four average meals, two cokes and two coronas cost $145. Definitely try somewhere else

Location is pretty good down on Clarke Quay. Sunday stroll we thought a bite to eat and a beer. Two coronas, a quesadilla and stuffed pepper Sgd71. Beer was warm, peppers very dull, quesadilla tasted ok, but overpowered by cheese, not much other flavour. Music annoyingly loud. Won't be back. PSwhile writing this the waiter just swiped by beer which wasn't quite empty

   My Wife and I have just returned from a week in clarquey where we had dinner  at the Muchos every evening and ate at the restaurant 4 times, we would recommend this establishment to all, the food is A1 and the service is also perfect, nothing is to much for the staff and you are never rushed. If you are nearby then go to the Muchos Restaurant.Kristine thank you for your recommendation.I appreciate your service skill and customer care.We will visit again...

We wandered around all the choices in Clarke Quay before deciding on this one. Great location along the water front and choice of indoor or out. Started with a fantastic Lychee Martini whcih was promising, Very let down by our starter of Chili Con Quesa. I have never seen anything quite like what was offered here and I have ordered this in many Mexican restaurants around the world. The 'dip' (and I use the world loosely and this was clearly made with canned/processed cheese) was served over the top of the corn chips rather than separately. Mixed (chicken & beef) fajitas for main were standard fare and as expecte

Well what do you expect when you go to Asia for mexican food! The food was expensive and bad - and when asked for a glass of water the waitress rudely responded we don't have free water!!! Just avoid - not worth it. Worst restaurant experience in Singapor

I went there for my birthday dinner with hubby. We loved the colourful backdrop and handicrafts. We ordered margaritas; nachos with beef; beef burito and chicken fajita. Enjoyed the food and will be back the next round with the kids.

We live in Singapore and decided to try Machos before watching a concert at Fort Canning Park. The food was terrible, service even worst and very expensive plus I was ill for the next 2 days. The only good thing about it was the view.

We had a great time chilling together after our borneo adventures, lots of good food, the soft wheat tortias are excellent and the nachos were good.

They dont have tacos on the menu, the food is average at best, not a place I am likely to return to. I will continue my search for a GOOD Mexican restaurant in Singapore

This was our second choice of somewhere to eat at Clarke Quay but the tapas bar never seemed to open so we decided to go to Muchos. It was a good choice and the service was quick & efficient which was exactly what we needed as we were short of time. Enjoyed a tasty quesadilla so no complaints about the food either

We had dinner down by the river at this restaurant. The service was great. We had a sharing/tasting plate between the 3 of us which was just enough. It was happy hour when we arrived, unbeknown to us. We shared a jug of margarita for 30SGD (approx 7 glasses) which was nice with the Mexican food. All in all is was nice and the food was tasty and delicious. We would return again and it was getting busy when we left. It appeared to be attended by customers

Had a lovely dinner here with my other half and friend! It was our only night out in Singapore and we're glad we ate here! We sat outside under the canvas and both the food and drinks were very tasty! Would definitely eat here again... the staff seemed friendly enough too. Didn't have to wait too long for our food... The meal overall wasn't particularly cheap but hey, you're in the middle of Singapore - right in the city (and Singapore isn't cheap for us Brits anyway!) and the food was good so I didn't mind

I tried an evening meal here in March 2012. After walking up and down Clarke Quay for a while I decided I'd give it a try. I ordered chips and salsa to start then the burrito and paid the extra 2 SGD to have it with cheese. What arrived didn't look very impressive, The chips looked and tasted stale, the salsa was watery and bland and the main course looked like it had come out of an Old-El-paso DIY mexican kit. It had a tiny piece of cheese melted on top and tasted very strongly of fish, which would be ok it I hadn't ordered chicken. I'm pretty sure they used the same pan/grill to cook salmon on before they got to my order and didn't bother to clean it. A few overpriced margaritas solved the taste problem but I still couldn't finish it all. Then the icing on the cake, when I paid by credit card the waitress came back out to ask me for my PIN number. She didn't want me to and type it in, she just wanted the number. I wouldn't go there again

Clarke Quay is bustling on a Saturday night to say the least! The location is good and you can sit out by the river.This place seems to have had very mixed reviews, but I found it to be pretty good. I had a chicken burrito with a green chilli pork stew topping. It was tasty. Lots of meat and veg in the burrito and I was impressed with the pork dish (although, living in Jakarta has left me pig-deprived, so I may not be the best judge!)We had some white wine (the house Malborough Sauv Blanc) which was crisp and fresh. Oddly non-matching wine glasses for me and my girlfriend, but this isn't really important, I suppose.Not the best meal I've ever had but doesn't deserve the poor ratings I've seen on here. P.S. if Clarke Quay is a bit much when you get there, Robertson Quay just along the river is more sedate

We ate here on our first night in Singapore as we were looking for non-Asian food our boys would eat. Great location next to the river. It was busy when we went at 9pm but we found the service good. Best thing was they had a kids menu, so my youngest ate sausage & chips!! Not the best Mexican food we have had but it was OK, although a bit overpriced but I guess that is Clarke Quay. I would suggest this restaurant if you are a family looking for a change from Asian food for your dinner, want to sit in a nice location by the river and don't want McDs or Subway
