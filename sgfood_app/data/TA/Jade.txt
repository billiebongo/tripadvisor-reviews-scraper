Recommend to go with the restaurant's specialities (e.g waygu beef, lobster noodles). Quality of the dishes were great. Staff were very attentive too.
5
Love this place for the quality and well priced lunch menus. Service is attentive and location is suitable for business lunch too. Will definitely return again.

Had our NYE 2017/18 celebrations here, food was good, service was great.
Most of the staff are Malaysian and are very friendly and attentive.
Great old fashioned location with plenty of character.
We would definitely return

Brought my relative from China to visit this place for dim sum. Yummy food, nice ambiance and attentive waitress. Price is steep thou!
4
I was at this restaurant having lunch with my collegues. The service is good and the food is nice. As we are in a private room, the waitress served professionally and observant.

This place feels a bit pretentious if I am honest. The lady serving us was lovely and she was down to earth. The lady taking the order was so busy talking into her microphone dangling round her chin, she was not listening to the order and jumped ton anything we said. So you ask how lobster was served and she had it ordered already!Having said that the wine was cold and the food was very good - however, crispy duck in pancakes at 38 SGD (I think) was just the skin - you have to pay to have the meat cooked and served with noddles and we felt rushed to decide on having that and vegetables. wine was buy 1 glass get 1 free but still the bill came to 271 SGD. Expensive for pretty middle of the road food. Posh surroundings and so 4 star but we had to order some wasabi prawn after our duck skin, meat, vegetables and noddles as we were still hungry Don't think we will be back as wouldn't be able to afford it
5
Multiple course or a la carte menus available. Great variety with the Spirit of Asia. Plenty of food. Interesting combinations. Service was very good. Amazing for vegetarians. We would return for another great meal.
5
Jade has maintained its high standard of food, in terms of taste and presentation. It sets a great example of Asian fine dining for the other Chinese restaurants to follow. The service is excellent, and the ambience is good. It is not overly crowded which enables the guests to enjoy their dinner in peace. I highly recommend Jade to tourists as well as the locals. However, do take note that it is a little pricey though
4
The restaurantâ€™s interior is stunning, the staff were quick to attend to us. We went during lunch on a weekday and were met with the working lunch crowd. Set menus seem to be a popular choice bu we decided to try the dim sum and order 2 main dishes. The dimsum was forgettable and unappealing. Lacking in texture and the variety appeared opulent but it was lacklustre in taste. The mains which we ordered were the lemongrass lamb rib and the baked honey cod, and boy were they instant hits. Stick to ordering the mains, and skip the dimsum altogether.
5
Came here to celebrate my birthday with a few friends. Loving the ambience here and the impeccable service. Quality of food is good too!
4
it really worth it for the dinner set menu, we order the $118 per pax, include abalone, lobster, wagu beef. They have their perfectly cook abalone and the wagu beef melt in my mouth.
5
Great ambience. Great food. Great service. It was a wonderful experience and staff was very attentive to our needs. Quality food for the price paid.
4
Visited after a business trip with some friends.
We went for the extended tasting menu. Not overly expensive.
It's clear the restaurant is aiming for its first Michelin star. Service immaculate.
Dining room slightly sterile and light, but food very good.
I would definitely recommend!
3
As restaurant was quite busy, the service is a bit slow on that day. Food and location convenient to Raffles place.
4
A nice place for both family and business. A refreshing new atmosphere after the renovation and good service throughout the meal. Food is delicate and nicely done. Nice portioned size with good visual appeal.
3
Food is average. Waiting time long. Service is so so. Must further improve on the food and serviced
3
I was not impress after reading that the dim sum was good. They had also cancelled the dimsum buffet and now only provide al-carte option
5
Beautiful restaurant in the historic Fullerton Hotel.Superb and elegant, delicate modern Chinese food.The service performance lags behind that of the kitchen's. The reception desk needs more maturity
5
I had 3 meals at Jade in two days. The food was amazingly delicious -double-boiled fish maw, sea cucumber, bamboo pith, tofu dumpling in superior consommé,-sautéed wagyu beef-fish headthe service very courteous and the ambiance great. I know I may never come back to Singapore but if I ever had, I’ll stay at the Fullerton and dine at Jade. Chef Leong Manager, AlanServer, Yvonne 5 stars dining
4
We 4 went for a leisurely lunch on a Sunday. We had the fixed price menus, S$68 & 88.The food was fantastic, varied, plentiful and beautifully presented. The staff were very professional and helpful, explaining what we were about to eat.The room is a tranquil oasis with a good ambiance.A top place for lunch and worth every penny
4
It was a pleasant dinner experienced but a little disappointed without any promotion at this moment.
3
The place was crowded even though it was a Saturday morning. The staff helped us ordered the dishes with reference to guests normal orders.
I personally preferred the roasted chicken & pork, yam puff, mango sago dessert and egg tart.
4
The food was yummy - love their soup and service staff was rather attentive. Had the dinner buffet. Love their hot & sour seafood soup, boston lobster (one of the limited to one order), Prawns with Truffled Silken Egg and coffee pork ribs.
5
Food and service were excellent. I will be back for business or leisure dining for sure. Highly recommended.
4
Visited this place twice in the past. I really love the atmosphere of this restaurant - it is elegant and very relaxing, totally conducive for a quiet family, friends or business meal. Both times I was there the place was full but it remained perfectly quiet yet unpretentious.Alas, the food was not much to write home about. We had the a-la-carte buffet both times and the selection, though large, was really very simple Chinese food, and the cooking was really just about passable.Service is pleasant and warm - slightly above average.I hovered between wanting to rate this a 3 or 4. Four because of the overall feel of the place, three because of the food. Then again four because I can foresee myself visiting a third time, but again three as I realised there's an increase in the price. Ok... I'll settle for four (it's better to be generous :)) - one point for good location.Note to restaurant: Please do improve on the quality of the food
3
We ate traditional set menu. Service was quite good but food not so good. Soup with sea cucumber was worst. Meat in main course was actually best one. After all what we ate...set menu was totally over priced . No next time.
3
If you're prepared to drop about S$110 per person (not including alcohol) on good but not great Chinese food, then this is the place for you. The best two dishes are wagyu beef and lobster with XO sauce. I think you'll enjoy those. Don't even bother ordering vegetables though: the choice is slim and you won't get anything better than what you'd find at a corner take-out place.The ambience is elegant, but at the end of the day I go to a restaurant for the food, not for the ambience.I saved 20% by using American Express, so it's worth asking whether they have any promotions before you pay
4
The restaurant ambiance is of exquisite chic chinoiserie theme. We went there for the weekend dimsum buffer lunch. The dimsum was good, though not the best I had in this region. But, there are a few really good dishes, e.g. fresh milk buns, crystal prawns in wasabi mayo, and Osmanthus cake. Generally, the pastries and sweeties were above average. Soup and one special dish (chilli crab in bun) are limited to one serving per pax. However, we thought it was overrated. Despite being a time constraint buffer session, the staffs and their services were very professional, and attentive. We had a very pleasant, non hasten lunch. Reservation is mandatory. And yes, you can get fully validated, complimentary parking
3
We were staying in the Fullerton and decided to have a lunch meeting at the Jade. The restaurant has very lively colors. Loved the decor.For the lunch we tried their set menus. The food was ok...nothing too great about it. The dessert was very good. I had the lobster as main course which tasted quite good.
5
All food is excellent, this place tries to be a Michelin style chinese restaurant, and it almost is! The dishes are of quiet decent size though, especially all main courses. You can hardly top-up the Asian service anywhere in Europe, so friendly and quick itis. I would change the lay out of the place itself a bit, in my view it is a bit too formal, with blue and grey colours prevailing, but it definitely does not spoil overall impression. Get ready for a 'beefy' check - above 400 Singa dollars for two- if you are not on a diet :)
5
Food is great as usual. Saw another table eating lobster noodles. Gonna try that the next time. Cost about 39sgd for that.
4
There were five of us for this business lunch. We have requested for the captain to prepare the dim sum in sets of 5. But it was still served as set of 3. We have to inform the staff to prepare another 2 for each set. We ordered the fruit platter for dessert. Most of the fruit types came in 4 pieces. The staff could have been more merticulous and inform the kitchen to prepare 5 pcs for each fruit types.
5
The Fullerton Hotel has a variety of dining options. The Chinese cuisine at Jade was simply superb. The corner table was ideal for our party of seven. The menu was pre-planned a few days prior to the event. The quality of the staff is among the very best in Singapore's 5 star hotels. The food was authentic -- start with the Peking Duck. Ambience was special as we watched glimpses of the National Day rehearsal fireworks. Bottom line is: the team from Fullerton headed by Evana, made this a night to remember
5
The dishes we had were delicious and I just loved the gorgeous interior of the restaurant. The dining experience was made extra special with the service staff on duty of 14 Jul who were very attentive and you could tell that they gave their best at work. Special mention to the lovely Rachel who also took time to inform us on membership privileges.
5
Happened upon this restaurant while walking around and decided to come back for lunch the next day. So very glad we did. What a beautiful room and the food and service were outstanding. Will definitely go back the next time we are in Singapore
3
Food quality is great but serving time was rather long. Also odd that the vegetable dish was served only after the noodle dish instead of serving prior / together.
2
Food is not bad but the service is poor. It's a brunch style so you order some dishes, they come and you get some more etc. Except we had to chase a coupe of dishes from the first order, and again when our second round came, and again when the third order came. These dishes eventually came when it was near the end of service.In one case a waitress with a tray of dishes just walked down and plonked the dishes on the edge of each table as she moved down the room: Fullerton Fast Service?We changed the tea as well to a different blend which was a hassle for them, and you couldn't have one of each.Fullerton is meant to be a flagship for Singapore, this restaurant lets it down. Still I do not think people will stop coming due to the Fullerton name.I would not come back here, Cherry Garden at Mandarin Oriental far far better
3
Normally, you would expect Michelin grade food in a top luxury hotel. However, food and service was just average good at best - you wouldn't get anything above or extra. We had the abalone which was affordable but tough. Fish was dry and tasteless even though it was traditional steam style. My companion who had the beef said it was sublime though the price is a bit ex. Overall I don't feel you will get your money's worth here.
2
Disappointed with the service. Food is served way too slow! We started dinner at 7pm and we are eating our last dish, 5th dish on the set menu at 930pm! We were left waiting for half an hr without food on the table.
4
Jade finally had a long delayed renovation with a fresh look.The chef has revised the menu and introduced new dishes. The food was good to very good. The wine list was very limited and the staff not trained to answer basic question like when a bottle was opened.The mapo tofu was one of the best in Singapore, not overwhelming in chilli. The Nanyang spicy fried chicken was nice but the flavour was rather monotonous; not enough mix of spices. The two seabass I had, one with lemon butter with mango purée and another with Kailan were good. The seafood consommé with the tofu shaped like a flower was very good.The lobster braised noodles were excellent with "wok hei".The wasabi prawns were commonplace and nothing to write about. The almond icecream and the coffee flavoured coconut icecream with avocado were both very good.Hope it continues to improve.Service standard has improved but still some way to go to be polished, expected for Fullerton Hotel
5
The Jade at Fullerton has a private dining for 8 guests and that is always useful when conducting business meetings.
They have a reasonable large vegetarian options to cater to all
4
Went for the Boston lobster Mee. Portion is small but it's definitely delicious, with a dash of chilli shrimp paste at the side. The pistachio mochi was exceptional tasty. Detox juice is not worth $12. Will visit often if not for the price. These three items which are a main course, a beverage and a desert will set you back by $70. Perhaps the steep pricing is to keep the crowd away.
5
Went for our last (Sunday) dinner in Singapore to Jade set in the iconic Fullerton Hotel. The restaurant is decorated in a very tasteful light blue chinese design. Food is amazing both in quality and price - $58 for a 13 course banquet-tremendous value. Staff ( all female) were very attentive and great fun - especially the girl with the fantastic laugh( sorry I cannot remember her name). A wonderful way to finish our holiday. Highly recommende
5
Good quality food and good service standard. Waitress was able to make recommedations and willing to be flexible
5
Jade at Fullerton is one Chinese restaurant in Singapore that my wife and I visit from time to time, whether by ourselves, or with friends and family.We usually came for dinner where we would order the Peking duck and the soups. They were delicious. They had also the set menu for those who wanted to sample the best of their selections.Service was attentive and friendly with a smile. Ambiance was nice with the sense of space and tasteful Chinese decoration. However if I may suggest a renovation is required to refresh the energy and to enhance the promotion of the restaurant, to bring in more diners as from the last visit the place was relatively empty.Overall it was a lovely and consistent place for an enjoyable dining experience
5
I stopped in for a late and quick meal. My server was outstanding, the food was delicious and quick. They were very accommodating when I asked to eat and be served out at one of the lobby tables rather than sitting in the restaurant (since I was dining alone). It was a very good experience
3
I expected better for a Chinese restaurant located in the Fullerton, the food was ok, but the restaurant was practically empty, yet it took very long for dishes to be served and the staff don't really know how to recommend food to achieve a balance. In the end everything was pretty oily.
5
The best Dim Sum in the world, the weekend Dim Sum buffet is one of the best deals in Singapore. The food is excellent, the Wasabi Prawns to die for, the service is excellent. Be on time so you do not miss out on the wonderful variation of orders. A must if you like Dim Sum
4
There were 2 of us looking for a place to have dinner when we meandered into Jade. The entrance on the side of the 1st floor corridor of The Fullerton hotel is not obvious and we almost walked past it.But it was a lucky coincidence that we walked in as the food is good. Hotel guests get 30% off the ala carte menu prices which makes it even better.We had crab meat and fish maw soup, half a Peking duck, asparagus fried with garlic and a slice of cod fish each. The highlight was definitely the duck - skin was crisply roasted and the "pancakes" were well wrapped.The kitchen forgot to serve the meat from the duck - but we were so full, it wasn't something we wanted to remind them.Service is good with adequate number of staff that you can always get the attention of one of them
3
Been coming here for years to where they know us by name, but unfortunately the food service continues its steady decline. The food is great, when it comes... which could be a long while before it does. Problematic since the seating time is limited and you find yourself rushing to eat and ordering more before the original order comes instead of enjoying the experience
4
Had the a la carte buffet. Food quality is maintained but the service is a tad slow due to the nature of a la carte buffet. Staff try hard to still put up a good service though.
4
It was quite a nice yum cha place. The only downside is that it was a bit pricey. The Xiao Long Baos are very nice
4
I like the small portion of the food serving. Atmosphere is good. Service is good too. Their buffet price is reasonable. Quality of food is good also. will come back agai
3
I read good reviews about Jade before deciding to try their ala carte dim sum buffet. However I am feeling quite disappointed the way service was being carried out at the restaurant. We arrived on time for our reservation at 11AM. However when we placed our first order of food, it took more than 30 minutes to serve all the dishes from our first order. When we placed our second order, they missed out some dishes. Before the restaurant could completely served our second order of food, the service staff came to ask for our last order at 12:15PM. Then suddenly every single dishes were served extremely quick. We could not really enjoy our meal because not once but twice your service staff came to hurry us to finish our meal. In the first place, serve our order timely from the start and not rush to serve all the dishes when you need to turn over the restaurant. I understand that the restaurant has 2 seatings (11AM and 1:15PM) and they need to turn over for the second seating. But what is the point of having such a beautiful ambience and not being able to enjoy it. We definitely feel very pressured and stressed out during the meal. The only reason I rated average was Evelyn who was serving our table, has a very polite demeanour. Otherwise I would have rated 'Poor'
4
A recent lunch at the Jade reminded me how much I liked this little gem, but which I hadn't been to in a while as it is not in a location I think of, when I think of going out to eat. Great starters like the crispy prawns in wasabi-flavored mayonnaise (must try). Even the vegetable dishes are great. Avoid the buffet and go a la carte
4
Read review about this place and decide to have dinner over here. The appetizer, soup, main course, vegetables, rice and dessert are good. Personally, chilled beef brisket with cucumber, char siew, apple soup, sauteed prawns with truffle scrambled egg, steam Chilean sea bass with preserved olives, poached spinach with trio of eggs, traditional fried rice with egg and shaved coconut ice with caramel jelly n honey avocado are good.Don't forget about the limited serving of lobster with spicy sauce and almond cream with bird nest n egg white.Overall the servings are GOOG except some dishes a bit salty. And of course the service is fantastic
5
If you are looking for a great place for dim sum in Singapore come to Jade at the Fullerton Hotel. They provide very good service and great dim sum buffet style on weekends. Do remember to make your booking in advance as it is very popular.
5
I stayed "by chance" for one night at the Fullerton Hotel which I enjoyed a lot. As I did not want to go out for dinner I booked a table at their Jade Restaurant without checking any rating before.Both the Hot and Sour Soup and especially the Beijing duck were absolutely world class. The duck was prepared at the table and was excellent in quality and in taste. Also the service was very polite and I am sue I will sooner or later return to this plac
5
We tried ala carte dinner buffet and the food is nicely prepared as well. We truly enjoyed dining there
5
Had a great experience at jade...the food there is very nice, the ambience there is very elegant, me and my husband have a wonderful birthday celebration at jade. The chocolate cake on the house is scrumptious too.
5
Made a reservation for dinner with my staffs. Had their Ala cart buffet. Dishes were yummy. All in small size.. service staff will recommend if it's to little to share. Very attentive. Good place to have family dinner!
5
Jade restaurant has a good variety of all you eat buffet oriental dishes. The food comes in small portion and it is well cooked and very delicious. End your meal with sweet dessert. Don't miss it cos' it is very tasty.
5
Although I eat only Veg, it was a great experience. Lots of options, extremely well created food. The best Roti Paratha I have ever eaten.
5
Whilst on a business trip took the opportunity to meet up with a couple of friends at this restaurant. My friends picked the place and glad they did. We ate buffet a la carte where items were selected from the menu as wanted all under a flat price. This allowed us to try a range of foods in a tapas style. Each and every dish was interesting, well presented and tasty. The chocolate covered prawns was a delight in particular. It's a relatively small place in the Fullerton hotel, so you get to eat in one of the more historic places in Singapore.
4
Jade is housed in what used to be the General Post Office. The Fullerton group took over and transformed the old GPO into a luxury hotel.Jade offers an extensive menu. You can opt for their ala-carte buffet which is very good value. Check for credit card discounts too.I love that everything is cooked to order and you can choose whatever you want from the menu. A word of advice is to order the smallest portion to share so you leave space to taste a little of everything!I love the belly pork, salted egg prawns, crispy squid, crispy bean curd, steam cod fish, chilled beef brisket, char siew, truffle scrambled eggs, Boston lobster, Wagyu, Thai fish fillet, stewed lamb, coffee ribs, home-style fried rice.We ordered the sorbet between dishes as a palate cleanser. The red bean pancake was nice but the chilled lavender green bean cake didn't work for us.Well worth a visit. They do a dim-sum brunch during the weekends. They have 2 seatings. It's very popular so book well in advance
4
The food was good. Ambience reasonable. Service was also good. The only negative about the whole dining experience is that the deserts were overpriced in my opinion
5
Jade at Fullerton Hotel is one of my favourite Chinese restaurants in Singapore. Dining out for two in a Chinese restaurant is often limiting as we are not able to try many different dishes as the Chinese dishes serving size tend to be big. Jade restaurant is an ideal choice as its ala carte dinner buffet offers single portion dishes which allow us room to try many dishes without getting stuffed. Everything I have tried on the menu is fabulous but the star dishes are 1)prawns with wasabi mayonnaise 2)crispy bean curd with spiced fragrant salt, 3)roasted five-spiced crispy pork belly and the not be be missed 5)coconut ice cream :) The ambience of the restaurant is good - it has a nice buzz without being noisy and the service staff there is always proactive and polite
3
Had dinner at Jade whilst staying at the Fullerton. In a city where every region of Chinese cuisine is well represented this was an average experience with service levels being very ordinary.Tables with large Chinese families seemed well serviced - maybe it was that we were just a couple?Wine service was really incompetent with a junior member of the waiting staff responding to our order for two types of white wine by pouring a volume into each glass that would have been correct for a European liquer , when I raised my eyebrow a more senior member of staff rushed over and poured in three times as much which took it to a normal restaurant serving. Not good enough for an international hotel restaurant
1
Due to the fact that my guests were checking in Festive Hotel at Resorts World in the afternoon on a weekday, I organised a Dim Sun lunch for 7 pax at Jade. I thought it would be more convenient for them to go RWS that same way. Sadly, it didn't go down well. What we ordered were pretty basic...the usual 'yum char' kind of buns & steamed siew mai & others. The menu was really limited. We ordered one exotic dish with scallops on a sharing basis and some soups too. The service staff who took our order, I guess she was new, could not hear or understand properly. So we waited for quite a while actually. It would be good to go through the order with the guest before rushing off. For comparison purposes... the variety and quality could not be anywhere near the standard of Peach Blossoms and Cherry Garden. Peach/Cherry Garden both have great service staff and fantastic food!It was a great disappointment. The bill was about S$600+!!! My guests also commented the quality of food being lacklustre. We won't return
5
Had a wondeful dinner with the immediate family for a (low-key) birthday celebrationWell looked after by the three female waitresses (they were all more like captains!) Polite, attentive and well groomedNice quiet ambience (though visuallu somewhat spoiled by a diner at the next table in cutaway (indecent) shorts and market flipflopsValet parking cost a bomb but as the carpark was too far to leave my elderly guests to walk on their own it was worth the $20!Food was individually portioned and well laid ou
3
We went for dim sum buffet during lunch on a Saturday. Decent dim sum and food with good ambience and service. No dish was that memorable though. Last order will take place about 30 minutes before your buffet end-time.
4
Very nice dim sum restaurant, located very centrally. Competently executed main dishes. Good for business lunch.
4
Our family of 5 came here for a dim sum buffet ($39++ per pax inclusive of tea).The food was above average though nothing outstanding. All items on the menu were buffet except for the soup and the cihili crab bao (only limited to one serving per diner)
4
Jade is popular with the business crowd for both lunch and dinner, and its best to make reservations. Service is attentive and you can choose from the a la carte menu or its set menus. If you are not a heavy eater, the chefs here are good at portioning the food for a meal and it comes just nice for lunch or dinner. My favourites are its roast chicken, soup, noodles dish and also its almond dessert. The joy about dining here is its ambience, nicely paced service and its food portioning
5
Nice environment, good attentive service, good food. An ideal place to have a quiet and relaxing dinner with loved ones
5
This is a small but elegant restaurant. The service was great from the time we arrived. The captain was quick to recommend to us the house favourites which sell out very quickly so that we have the best dishes that the restaurant could offer. She was very attentive - when my wife coughed, she came over and tapped her back to ease the cough and also brought her a glass of warm water, something we have not experienced elsewhere. The food was just as great - the dim sum was dainty and delicious especially the wasabi prawns, the dumplings, siew mai, Xiao long bao etc. We ordered the coffee pork ribs which was succulent and cooked to perfection. It was a great experience, bth in terms and food quality and the service. Strongly recommended 
5
It was busy at dinner-time despite it being a weekday and I was lucky enough to have made reservations. I was greeted quite immediately when I walked up to the entrance of the restaurant and was promptly shown to a table. The ambience was cosy and classy and I found myself seated comfortably. Our dinner was the Peking duck wraps and the bean curd with minced chicken. With the leftover duck, I asked for it be served with noodles. Overall, the food was delicious. The service rendered was even more impressive. Mee Wan, who attended to us was caring and attentive throughout our dinner. She was chatty when she had to be and apologetic when the food took a while to get to our table. Well done
3
Visited the Jade for a birthday celebration with my family. Read online about the peking duck, so we had to try it. Tasted like normal peking duck but there was orange peel in the wraps, not my favourite because i dont fancy oranges. Ordered two appetizers, crispy white bed fish (cld have been a typo in the menu? White bait?) and roasted pork. Roasted pork was oh so yummy with the crispy skin and moist meat & fats. White bait was average. For mains, we had spinach tofu, stir fried scallops with xo sauce and ee fu noodles fried with the peking duck meat (cost us $3/person for the noodles). Mains were yummy but nothing to shout about. Although we brought our own birthday cake (lychee mousse lapis from the fullerton bakery) the restaurant gave us another small chocolate cake which was delicious. Good thing we had a 30% discount from a voucher at our previous visit to Town restaurant. Unlikely to return without such discounts cause the food is pricey
5
Located at Fullerton Hotel, everyone has high expectation on Jade Restaurant and it delivered ! The ambience is great and not too noisy as in most Chinese restaurants. The waitresses are experienced and know how to serve well. Unless many restaurants who use a lot of temp staff. The Jade 50 menu was well crafted. The desserts are the best in Singapore such as the Iced coconut with vanilla, the mango honey dew sago and pancakes.
5
I came to this restaurant in The Fullerton after a long overnight flight from the UK so was quite hungry. I was entertaining prospective customers with some colleagues. i found the lunch menu extensive and good value for money at least for hotel venuesThe restaurant coped very well with the food preferences of our guests and one couldn't fault the quality of the cooking. so top marks to all concerned. it was quite a lengthy affair due to the sheer quantity of dishes and food!hardly a compliant more of an observatio
5
Beautiful restaurant, with two private dining rooms and two partitioned areas it is an amazing and unique dining experience .The quality of food, service and ambience at this restaurant is superb, menu was explained well, good advice/recommendations was given. Food came out quickly too. Our favourite dishes include the pan-fried scallop with shrimp paste in spiced fragrant chilli and crispy honey glaze sea prawn with orange salsa. The facility it offers the highest level of personalised service. While Jade Restaurant is not the cheapest place to eat in Singapore, but it is well worth the exceptional service and quality of food – Jade is a must for lovers of good food. I highly recommend trying this place, I will definitely be back
4
I celebrated my birthday at Jade. The service we received was excellent. There's a dinner buffet promotion now where you can try 50 dishes for 1 price! The food is delicious and the portion is just right. Will return agai
5
My family of 5 was there for dinner under the Restaurant Week menu ($58 per person). We were almost half hour late and I called to inform them. The restaurant manager was very gracious and kept the table for us.The entrance to Jade was tucked away at the corner of the cafe, next to a souvenir shop. The ambience was good, not too noisy although there were at least 3 to 4 tables having birthday celebrations. We took the set menu and added on half a Peking duck for $38 (these few weeks there is a Peking duck promotion) and a half-bottle of Chardonnay for husband and myself. Kids had their fresh juices and we also ordered Pu'er tea.Unlike Golden Peony, the prices were all clearly stated in the drinks menu placed on the table. Not cheap ($10 to $12 per person for juice, chinese tea) but at least we knew what we were paying for.The set menu was Chinese food with a fusion theme. Soup was blended green pea with crab meat. The fish was sea perch panfried with mashed crab roe and french beans. The noodles had a slice of black truffle with a few slices of abalone. Dessert was quite cute, a seafood theme platter with coconut ice cream topped with mango slices, and the plate was surrounded by a coffee dumpling moulded into a sea shell, a pink starfish biscuit, blue slices of marshmallow and a sago custard ball with ‘fine sand’ (biscuit crumbs).Menu would have been insufficient for the big eaters, had we not supplemented it with the Peking duck (sliced and wrapped in a pancake with spring onion/ cucumber/ orange peel, fried meat wrapped in lettuce).Service was very good, wait staff was prompt, polite and attentive, although they were quite short-handed yesterday. A waitress (her first day at work!) told us that was because several staff were on urgent leave. Overall, we felt the taste was good but you will need to get used to it not being the traditional Chinese cuisine. We were on the whole quite pleased with the food and service
1
The various menus are so extensive that we were lost. Eventually we chose a starter, main course and pudding each but went away hungry even though we are not big eaters. Very small quantities of unappealing and very expensive food.
4
I had dinner at Jade with a colleague on a recent trip to Singapore. The food was excellent. We had stuffed scallops, prawns, pork ribs and a stir fried beef dish. Very enjoyable but it is not cheap!I'd go back but ther is so mich choice in Singapore at the premium end
4
Went for Loh Hei and a larger meal with my daughter. The Yu Sheng was excellent. One of the best I have had. The food was also very good. Ambience was OK. Service was a little abrupt but not too bad. I'd recommend the restaurant mainly for the Yu Sheng and the food in general.
4
I was quite pleased with the quality of the dim sum and especially the reasonable pricing. I returned to the restaurant whenever I need a Dim sum fix. Advance reservation is a must however due to the small restaurant capacity

If you're looking for a good all-you-can eat dim sum brunch, don't give a whit about charm and grace, and love a good deal, Jade is the place for you. Just don't order sparkling water, and you're good to go. For about $39 US, you may have as many items on the menu as you like EXCEPT that you get one soup only and one chili crab dumpling per person. The seafood hot and sour soup is outstanding--very sour and full of seafood. The dumplings were uniformly good, with the exception of a rather gelatinous and tasteless radish cake. The chili crab and wasabi shrimp dim sum were fabulous. At $13 per large bottle, the sparkling water is a real ripoff, so don't be as dumb as we were: skip it! The waitresses are competent and make no attempt to establish any rapport with the clients. They kind of fling the food on the table and disappear. Their supervisor is on the floor and saves the day with her pleasant, customer oriented personality

If you know what good quality Chinese restaurant food should taste like, you will realise when eating here that it's not what you are getting.The dim sum we ordered for lunch this week was pretty ordinary and the e-fu noodles very bland tasting. The walnut cream soup ($10) was served with a single piece of tang yuan (glutinous rice bowl). While you don't expect value for money meals at hotels in general, the pricing here ($88 for two) is very high for the quality of the food. The dining room with its high ceiling and floor to ceiling windows could be an elegant space. In its present guise, it has the feel of a rather staid civil service club. One saving grace, service was good (efficient and helpful). With the hotel having recently been declared a national monument in Singapore, we think it's time the hotel operator considers a revamp of the Chinese restaurant (please look into the quality of the food - not just the pricing and the restaurant decor). It has the potential to be something special

Atmosphere was nice with soft music playing in the background and high ceilings as it is on the ground floor of Fullerton Hotel. Food was delicious and the UOB card promo of 4 for the price of 3 for the dinner buffet of $58/pax makes it more worth it even though there were 5 of us in the group. Only downside is some of the more junior waiting staff is not super proficient in their english and we found it easier to speak to them in chinese
5
Really nice surroundings. Portions are modest but flavours are high. Doesn't seem to be particularly well known about despite location in very prominent hotel
4
Nice surroundings, good food and decent price. Portions are modest, but flavours very high. Doesn't seem particularly well known about!

This place serves average dim sum but over priced. Ok to eat here if you are on a business lunch. Service is also not top notch.
1
Wife and I ate there last night and it was terrible food/service and at the end had to pay 208 dollars for a 5 dollar meal. Hate going to a restaurant happy/hungry and leaving feeling robbed and still hungry.

Want to recommend lunch time dimsum buffet on weekends. Booking is must. There are two timeslots and the first one is slightly busy as they have to kick you out, or sorry, as they have to welcome gusts at 2nd slots at the timely manner. Make sure to order "in bulk" if you want to be sure something is on your table ;-
5
Excellent cuisine in truly elegant surroundings. In fact, and this is an ambitious statement, I believe it to be one of the best 'Chinese' style restaurants I've found in Singapore. As with any restaurant in Singapore, drinkable wine is not inexpensive (and the same applies to glasses of diet coke!!), but this factor is unlikely to sour what will be an excellent evening.P.S. Visit - XII/201

During working day lunch this is the place where all the bankers congregate. Hence, bankers' price. They have high ceilings and you can see all the who's who in the banking community. Everything is by a set meal - so whether you like it or not these are the dishes Nice to come if you are not the one paying.
5
We had a very enjoyable evening at the Jade Restaurant. Great atmosphere and wonderful food. The Peking duck was a great hit. As there was just the two of us, we ordered only three dishes which was sufficient for us and did not break the budget. The staff were very attentive. We wanted a memorable night out in Singapore and we were not disappointed
5
This is one of the most fabulous and super value for money dim sum buffet!! There are 2 sittings: 11am and 1:15pm.Best to book early in advance!!! We were just lucky that my girlfriend knows the F&B Manager of the hotel who manage to procure a table for us in a private corner. The staff were super polite, and super nice. I was first to arrive but since the first sitting were still filling their belly, I was shown to a comfortable waiting area and given the menu, so I already knew what we wanted by the time we sat down.We also have a fabulous server who recommended how many trays of dishes we should order, and what to order. By the time everyone arrived, the food was laid out and we didn't have to wait. Just tucked in!Must try: Fried mantou with chilli crab stuffing, lobster and scallop congee, pork dumplings in squid black ink, stewed pork trotters with ginger and vinegar, bird's nest and truffle soup, the mini egg tart, xiao long bao with abalone, etc etc etcDEFINITELY GOING BACK FOR MORE!!!!
1
Wow, this restaurant was a HUGE disappointment. The entree I ordered had about 10 little bites of food, was incredibly bland, and I had to wait about 45 minutes to get it. The table next to us with a big party was getting all of the attention. The hotel is very pretty but the food doesn't match. I ended up getting my appetizer after my entree as well. And the worst part?? Still water is $12!!! Get ready for an overpriced bill and severe disappointment. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone!
5
I was delighted to find this restaurant- unbeatable combination of excellent food, met specialist requirements, reasonable price point, beautiful ambience, and central location.
4
Delicious food, quick service. We had hot and sour soup, crispy prawns, chilli chicken, fried rice. Was all really great. Better than expected for a hotel restaurant. Highly recommended!
5
Most locals believe that restaurants located in a hotel usually are bad and overpriced. This is not true when it comes to Jade in The Fullerton Hotel. The food quality surpasses all the other huge and famous independent restaurant in the country (my personal opinion). I went there with my family members. We were recommended to order a dinner set as they were designed in sequence and combination for the best fine dining experience. This is not a common practice for Chinese cuisine, but I do like the concept of it. We ordered the Imperial Set, starting with 3 different appetizer, a soup, a tofu, a fish, a seafood noodle and a dessert, at a price of S$98 per person. The staff are friendly and professional. The food served separately to each individual. I guess you may request them to do it in the "Chinese" way, because they do have a lazy susan on each table
3
Have been there with a group of 6. Asian and Asian fusion cuisine, high quality and beautifully arranged. Wine menu rather average. Setting for ca 100-120 or so guests, I would estimate. They have 2 separate private dining rooms. Furniture is a bit on the heavy gold/dark wood side for my taste. Service was knowledgeable, friendly but not very swift
5
One of finest Chinese food had here in Jade and that is vegetarian. Mr Alson Li, Operation Manager, met and specially thanked for arranging the vegetarian food with his great experience as it is not always readily available how to make the mix of food and serve urgently during lunch but its all wonderful beginning to end with wow ice cream. Loved it.
3
Jade looks great and the service seems good till you make the mistake of ordering the set menu. There seemed to be a rush to get our meals out of the kitchen quickly whether we had finished the course before or not. Some of the food was warm, some of it just wasn't good. Singapore has seriously good restaurants. This isn't one of them

It's been years since I last had a lobster platter. I am not referring to the popular seafood in plastic bags these days, but those old-school lobster fruit salad with spring rolls and fried prawn rolls (hei zhor) typically served as the first dish during Chinese wedding dinners. Full story on www.dairycream.blogspot.comThis is part of the Nostalgic Feast Menu which features classic Cantonese delights from the 70s and 80s.One of my favourite dishes that evening was the Crispy Yam with Kung Bao Chicken and Cashew Nuts. Infused with dried chilli, the sweet and smoky sauce coated the chicken chunks evenly, making this a welcome change to the typical stir-fry seafood and celery filling.Whether one was a fan of duck to begin with or not, this Chinese Eight Treasures Duck lured everyone with its wonderful fragrance when it was sliced apart to reveal eight mouth-watering fillings including salted egg yolk, roast pork belly, dry scallops and glutinous rice. The meat was moist and flavourful, thanks to a tedious overnight marinating process
5
It was rather late when I had dinner there with a friend. They offered an all you can eat menu at $58 per person ++ which we tried. The reason was because less people eat in a Chinese restaurant would only can eat less variety from the menu. The all you can eat would come in small portions just enough for one or two person, so we could choose more variety of foods from the menu. It was incredible because the serving time was good and all the food we ordered were delicious. Good variety of dessert was included. It was one of the dinner I won't forget
3
Because there were only two of us and we wanted some variety, we chose the S$ 85 banquet" menu. Not good. The pig's knuckle is to be avoided. There were a couple of good dishes - the large prawn and the delicate noodles - and it was a expensive.
5
We had ala carte dim sum buffet at Jade restaurant. There are lots of varieties of dim sum and all are delicious. Must try are the wasabei prawns, the cut juicy char siew and roast pork (we had 2 rounds of servings) and the black vinegar pork. The service are good and the waitress who served us is very attentive.I would recommend this ala carte dim sum buffet who likes to eat dim sum and would come back again
3
Went there for CNY dinner with my colleague. It was a set menu with over 100 SGD per head. The food was OK but nothing outstanding so I do not think that I got much value from it.
Wont come back !
5
Jade serves wonderful Chinese food...... service is excellent, wine selection is good ( but a little pricey). The ambience is pretty good although like all chinese restuarants the big tables can be pretty noisy---- otherwise its a very pleasant dining experience
4
I enjoyed a quick Yum Cha as we had just landed back in Singapore and made it to the Hotel in time for a late lunch. The quality of the yum cha was excellent, especially the pork buns. Would like to go back when I am not so close to closing time so I can enjoy a bigger selection.Dinner two nights later was also very good and I enjoyed the buffet style choice on offer. Service from Staff also very attentive and they remembered me from 3 days earlier. I would eat here again if staying in this Hotel
5
We have twice been here for Sunday lunch. Mainly Chinese clientele which is always a good sign. The Sunday lunch has a huge menu and you can just keep ordering - the price includes everything. The food is very light, beautifully prepared and cooked - and you should try some 'new' dishes. Go, and enjoy!
3
Good Ambiance but relatively disappointing dim sum given our expectation and somewhat slow service. Appetizers are really appetizers as the serving sizes are really really small. Golden ‘mantou’ stuffed with chilli crab meat (one piece per diner) was good but again really small. Could not argue for $38++ Per Adul
4
Visited the Jade with my wife for the weekend brunch. Overall we were happy with the choice and quality of food. The service was excellent and very attentive. But we were greeted by a grubby, soiled menu which did not set the scene and was not befitting of the Fullerton. So all good but just needs the restaurant manager to consider first impressions. Bill for 2 was around $115.
2
I had our office Annual Lohei (Prosperity Salad) dinner at Jade last night and the experience definitely did not live up to expectations.Let me highlight the good points first - very attentive staff, lush decor in a beautiful hotel etc built up expectations for the start of the "feasting season" of the Year of the Goat. The food, however, was a different story...We ordered the Family Style Set Menu ($138++ per person) which started off with the salmon yusheng. It came on plate with a "painting" done with five-spice powder. Very nice touch, since each plate would be a different “work of edible art". The design depicted a New Year greeting, befitting the occasion. The salad with peach dressing was a bit flat, lacking in punch and flavour, but at least it wasn't overly sweet like in many restaurants. The small quantity of champagne jelly didn't do anything to the dish at all.The appetizer dish consisting of 5 pieces of bite size pieces (pork rib, roasted duck, lamb loin roll, crab meat springroll and mayonnaise prawn) was like a selection of stuff I had scooped up at a catered buffet party. Maybe it was the way it was served, but not one of the 5 pieces of appetizers stood out as above-average tasty. They were just... OK.The soup that followed was the biggest disappointment of the evening. Braised bird's nest and bamboo pith in superior broth? The stock was thin in flavour. The soup was starchy with some crunchy bits and the truffle jus just didn't work.The menu said Steamed red grouper was the next dish. Did the restaurant fail to find a larger fresh fish at the market that day? They served 2 small medium sized fishes instead. Anyone who knows anything about Cantonese steamed fish will tell you that SIZE MATTERS. This simply won't do!! Even though the fish was fresh and well-flavoured.The sauteed Boston lobster with chicken floss was a much better dish, followed by 2 more fairly tasty items, abalone + mushroom and vegetables, and glutinous rice with Chinese sausages.There were 2 desserts - almond cream with chocolate dumpling (a nice variation on the traditional tangyuen) and what was probably the highlight of the dinner - the niangao tart - soft buttery pastry filled with chewy rich niangao.I was glad that the dinner got better as it progressed, culminating in the excellent niangao tart, but the poor start had already dampened the overall experience.NOTE to all high end Chinese restaurants in Singapore - we need much more than your beautiful presentation. Ultimately, the food is still the main thing

I was so looking forward to have dim sum brunch at Jade restaurant. Huge choice of different dim sum, spring rolls, starters and main dishes. But note: If you are 2 persons, you will only get 2 dumplings, 3 persons 3 dumplings and so on. If you want more, order again and again. We told our waitress (I don't want to make her name public, but she performed worst! All other waiters and waitresses did a great job), that we wanted some dishes twice (so not 2 pieces, but 4!!), well after waiting for 10 mins to get our first dish (other tables were already full of dishes and they ordered after us!) we only got 2 cheese dumplings.. For the second dish (which we already ordered in the beginning) we had to wait 25 more minutes. Other dishes already ordered a second time and were full of dishes. That waitress went to all other guests and served them food, but ignored us. Some people came half an hour after us and were served all the time, while we had to wait 35 mins to finally get the 3rd plate of dim sum... The couple sitting next to us got already about 15 dishes, while we had 3! So that waitress really ruined the brunch for us! The only moment when she acted fast was, when we wanted to pay. It didn't even take her a minute to bring the bill... Food was excellent, really one of the best dim sum I ever had. Other staff was friendly and polite and attentive. We asked a waitress to bring more chilis and immediately got it. I would really love to go there again, but never order at that very worst waitress
3
I'd say that only roasted duck was OK out of all our choices from the a la carte menu. The rest was overpriced and not particularly tasty. The most disappointing aspect is a long list of fresh "fish of the day" options, when in fact only one was available. I mean, the food was OK and not terrible, simply not good enough for the terrific place that is Fullerton Hotel. It is rather expensive, even after the 30% discount for Fullerton residents
1
Our recent family holiday visit to The Jade was marred by bad service and poor quality, over $$$$ priced food. Upon arrival and seating our party of seven was immediately given the hard sell on the set menu. Our interest in ala carte dining was dismissed out of hand as we were not even given a menu despite our request. Thus we settled for two selections from what turned out to be an ill conceived set menu. What read as an interesting mix of flavors arrived at the table tepid, tasting bland, and over cooked. While I am not adverse to spending $150US++ per person for dinner, I must say I expected something more than what the Jade delivers. Coupled with service that found us searching for our wait staff throughout our dining experience, our party found the evening a grave disappointment.
5
Excellent service, great food and quick service. Good value for money. The menu is extensive and everyone can find something they like. Only recommendation would be to add a few more desserts :)
4
Jade is always a reliable choice for an efficient business lunch. Not too noisy which is good. The food quality is generally consistent.
5
Wow - Loved the food and the service - top notch. Delicious five-course "set" lunch was tasty and well presented. Staff were fast and efficient. Definitely worth a return visit. Thanks!
4
First time having a Chinese dinner buffet styled, its actually ordering as per normal but the servings are unlimited. Food is mostly good, not that salty. The walnut paste with sesame glutinous riceball dessert is especially good. Service is prompt and friendly especially since we went to tung lok signatures in the afternoon and had a bad server. It's quiet when we started dinner at 7pm but the crowd starts coming at 8plus (think tourists have late days)
3
Quite a lovely place, tables well spaced and not too busy. Great service, average price for Chinese fine dining. Food is decent and average. Lobster noodles were very good. Portions were generous. They failed on steamed fish - slathered with green sauce but had a fishy smell
5
Went for 2nd seating which is from 1:15pm to 3pm. I think the buffet time should be longer. If I never remember wrongly, last order was done around 2:15 or 2:30pm. Overall I think the food is good. Only felt that the roasted pork is kinda too little. Most favourite is the eggplant. Reasonable price. Service is good. No complaints. I would go back again
4
We had the first seating at Jade for tim sum yesterday. Well, we started the buffet at 11am and perpetually I think we have to eat real fast as the it ended at 12.45pm sharp. I find most of the tim sum are tasty as they are cook with quality ingredients. However, to my disappointment was the roast pork which was thinly sliced and is not juicy as in those thick square sliced served in other restaurant. I feel that they should give us more time to go through our brunch comfortably and hopefully they can extend to 2 or 2.5 hrs for each session
4
We ordered the coffee pork ribs, ma po tofu, chili fried chicken, fried rice, wonton in spicy vinegar, sea bass in miso, sweet and sour pork and a couple other items. We come here often. We love the made to order concept - one price and order as many small dishes as you want. The quality of the food is consistently good! The service is above par. The atmosphere is a little dated. Don't be surprised if the restaurant is half empty
5
The family had the Weekend dimsum gourmet brunch here at Jade. Firstly, service was attentive, courteous and quiet. The restaurant was full which speaks well of the quality of this restaurant's food. We ordered so much dimsum, some the first time we have ever tried anywhere else. Among the most notable were fried eggplant and bean curd, pork ribs with coffee sauce, deep fried prawn with wasabi mayo and golden cheese dumplings ( we ordered another serving of this, it was that good!). We had the oven baked tarts for desserts - also very good. Highly recommended for a visit to Singapore
5
I was fortunate to have been served by an excellant service ambassador Meehwa and she has been cheerful and attentive throughout my brunch. Thanks for Managers Doris and Alson for making my visit a pleasant one. This is my first Dim Sum brunch at Jade and it has left me with a desire to re-visit it soon.Food is of very good quality and taste. Take a look at the pics i have taken and you will have a good feel about what they serve. (i didn't have the chance to try all) One thing that is worth mentioning is the 1 serving restriction for their soup. I mean, for their bird nest's soup, 1 serving is perfectly fine. But others like Hot & sour soup should be available for trying out as well. (this is different from other restaurants that restrict only premium items)Bird nest soup is a bit salty, and the mango sago is a bit too sour.. Other than that, the rest are pretty good
4
Old fashioned Hotel Restaurant that really needs a face-lift but the attentiveness of the staff more than made up for it!
The Peking Duck was amazing. Prepared by 2 people in front of us!
Chamomile tea was divine!
5
The food and service were flawless. Try everything on the buffet menu (all cooked to order). One note - soft drinks cost 12 SD each.
4
They have a lot of veg options. Corn soup is worth having. Also veg dimsums are mind blowing. This palace generally requires booking especially for lunch. It is inside the Fullerton hotel one of the best hotels in Singapore. Also noodles are worth having. Expensive palace
1
We wanted a high class Chinese meal and got a disaster. We booked a table and turned up on time. The waiting staff pushed the set menu, but we didn’t want that much food. We ordered off the overcomplicated al la carte menu (what’s a person amount and what’s a portion?) and waited – and waited – and waited. The food arrived in drips and drabs, when it did arrive it was nearly cold and distinctly unappetising. 4 small bottles of sparkling water cost S$48. The waiting staff were running around after a private party and we seemed to be a distraction at best. At one point they were even shouting at each other in front of the customers. The dining room has no ambience – it’s like a works canteen. The staff did seem to recognise that they had made a complete mess of our dinner and gave us a discount – frankly the only decent response would have been to waive the bill altogether. They also threw in a rather sad and tiny dessert in an attempt to appease. Too little, too late.While this bitter experience didn’t ruin our stay at the Fullerton it certainly put us off eating at a hotel restaurant there again

For full review and photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2013/10/ala-carte-dim-sum-buffet-at-jade.htmlRevisited on 13 May 2014 (Tues - Public Holiday) Weekend Ala Carte Dim Sum Brunch Buffet (Service level has dropped - Always see short of manpower), Food Quality has dropped as well, food/soup portion became smaller and smaller as compared to 2013)Price: SGD38++ per person = Total bill of SGD89.45 for 2 pax.  (Only Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays - Inclusive of Free Flow Chinese Tea) 1st seating: 11.00am - 12.45pm (Last Order: 12.15pm)2nd seating: 1.15pm - 3.00pm (Last Order: 2.30pm)The dim sum here are mostly quite light which is good, you won't get sick of it easily. The only minus point of having dim sum here is "Time too short". They only give 1hr 45mins to order and eat which is actually very rush for a Ala Carte buffet. I hope they can increase to 2 hours in case customers are slightly late. Probably shorter dining time is part of the reason why the price here is only at SGD38++. So there're pros and cons to dine here. But if given a choice, of course I would rather pay lesser with lesser dining time like Jade here, so that I will keep coming back with this affordable price at such a nice ambience, rather than having to pay SGD68++ for 3 hours long like some of the hotels did

My brother-in-law treated our extended family to this restaurant for a family relative's birthday 2 Sunday nights ago. It was our first time to this restaurant. The food was sumptuous, though the portion was a bit small. The shark's fin was changed to bird's nest, due to environmental reasons. Their lobster noodles were very fresh. Their dessert with coconut, and ice cream, was also not too sweet, which suited my diabetic mom. Knowing that it was one of our family relative's birthday, the restaurant showed their sincerity by giving us a hand-written card, and even asked one of the waiters to take us a group family photo. However, the lighting was not set properly, so the photo seemed dim and awfully tiny. I would have give this restaurant 5-star if not for the wrong spelling of occasion on the card. Instead, they horribly spelled it as 'occasiton'. No one spotted the mistake. As the birthday boy is an Englishman, his wife did not dare to point out the spelling mistake to him
3
Went here with my daughter and son in law whilst visiting them. We went to the al a cart buffet lunch. Beautiful surroundings but very slow service and silly small portions brought out. Food is ok but nothing to make it stand out. Felt rushed as was 2 sittings and felt obliged to finish so they. Could clear tables for next sitting. Saying all this going back Saturday evening so let's hope this is better. Will let you know
2
We were staying at the Fullerton Bay Hotel across the street and decided to go here after reading the reviews. First let me say the restaurant itself is beautiful. It's inside the fabulous Fullerton Hotel. Also, its not typical Chinese food; it's more elevated (at least for me). Having said that, the food just wasn't good.We started with the crab roll dumplings. They were bland and tasteless. Even after I added loads of chili. The Wasabi Prawns weren't bad but weren't special either. The most disappointing thing was the chicken in clay pot. Basically it was boiled chicken with little or no seasoning and a broth. That's it. ARGH. Eating the soft, wet chicken skin was disgusting. The staff was very pleasant and professional and the place is beautiful, but you couldn't pay me to return there
3
We thought okay as we stay at their sister property we will have dinner at Jade, even though the reviews were soso. we paid dearly for our laziness to explore the many other different Chinese restaurants in Singapore. The service was good once we were seated at the table we like. The entire restaurant was quasi empty and we got THE table that was next to a pillar facing the wall and next to the bus station.The portions are quite small compared to the ones one get anywhere else in Singapore. To the food now; maybe we ordered the wrong items chicken in clay pot, a sampler of prawn wasabi sampler, crab roll dumplings and stir fried asparagus. If I wouldn't have said please prepare the asparagus spicy they would have tasted very bland.ALL IN ALL: expensive and very blan
4
This is a good restaurant with great service and the food is good. It has long been considered an 'institution' in Singapore, so it is worth a visit if you want to mix some upper notch Chinese culinary delights into your Sing experience, although it is a little overpriced.
5
Jade restaurant is a unique mix from high end cuisine & service. They pay attention to every detail. I am not a big fan of Chinese cuisine but Jade is something must try. Well balanced menu.
I will be back for sure.
5
Tis is without à doubt the best value and highest quality Dim Sum ever, weekend delight with great food wonderful service. If you love Dim Sum book a table for weekends only because many know about this great meal
5
Best chinese restaurant in singapore - great food and good service.
Although always packed so make sure you book
5
Definitely order the sampler dinners - there are too many wonderful things to choose - and this gives you a sampling of a number of dishes.
3
Went for ala carte buffet dim sum with partner. Dim sum was ok , serving portion was good for two.. would expect better quality though . Variety of selection consider good. Recommend for families dinning. Overall experience is pleasant. Price acceptable.
4
Dinner for two, fantastic attentive service, outstanding food. You must try the Peking Duck and the Chili Crab. The wine list was not as extensive as we would have hoped, but did not detract from the overall experience
5
I had a weekend dimsum buffet at lunch. It needs to be booked in advance. Their services are not bad but also not good, though, all kinds of Dimsums that I ordered were really delicious. But seafood soup and pork knuckle were not my taste. I just recommend to order dumplings. Even though there's some disappointment, since the price, around S$ 45 including taxes, was reasonable and all dumplings were excellent, I think it's worth it. Great:
5
I don't usually do Restaurant reviews but Jade's service was so exceptional that I had to tell you guys.Went there for dinner and got the 7 course set meal which is about $52SGD++ per person. We had perfectly cooked chinese cuisine from peking duck to truffle egg white fish maw soup. The frshness of each ingredient used and attention to detail in each dish is certainly commendable. We all just wished the portions were larger.The best part was certainly the service. Especially we want to thank Susan and Ivy for their kind attention to our table. Our tea cups was never once empty and they cared for evey single detail.Especially nice touch was the cake and card they prepared when they learnt one of us was celebrating a birthday. Inside the card was not just some typed out generic message but a polaroid of our group and a hand drawn message by Ivy or Susan which was very special and made them friends instantly.Jade u should be very proud of your service team and I look forward to dining at your establishment again.Cheers
5
We experienced the Sunday Weekend A La Carte Dim Sum Buffet Lunch. They have two seating times, 11am or 1.15pm. We were a little worried taking our two small children 3.5yrs and 20mths but they enjoyed the different foods and the staff were good with them. The food was fantastic and just kept coming. The portions are very small but you eat so much, we rolled out after two hours. We'd go back in a heart beat. Well worth it

Finding a good dim sum buffet in singapore isnâ€™t easy but luckily came to find out about the saturday and sunday dim sum buffet here. Pricing for dim sum here is pretty acceptable considering the 20 choices of dim sum you get along with a soup, main course, desert, as well. Price with tax comes to $44 per person. The only thing to note here is each dim sum food only comes with 2 pieces. The only downside I experienced here was the fact that the staff forgot my order a few times and I had to tell them about it. Can be expected I suppose considering it was under staffed while I was there. Just to note go dressed as you want as no dress code needed
5
I have been there at least 5 times a year since 2003, Good service, quality foods served and the price are fair.
5
This time we chose the Peking Duck special and it was excellent and enjoyed with a bottle of good Pinot Noir.
The service was unobtrusive and excellent.
2
The place is reasonable, singapore offers so much varity on food, This place can offer more varity, current Menu is just Ok
3
5 dishes for 3 of us was sufficient for one average eater, presentation was elegant, service average,
4
Food was good, portion could have been a little bigger for the prices though. We (2 people) ordered 3 dishes and we left a little hungry still.
5
What a wonderful "Chinese" experience this was. From start to finish our meal was superb as was the location and service.Possibly. the only negative was the air conditioning,too cold, but at some stage during the evening they did adjust it,maybe due to feedback from a lot of the diners. The Peking Duck pancakes were better than excellent as was the Sang Choi Bau,a fish dish done with pickled vegetables had wonderful flavor as did the stir fried greens,subtle and perfectly cooked.The chicken done with chillies and ginger provided just the right amount of heat and flavor without being too overpowering.Our last dish was possibly the only let down,crispy egg noodles done with prawns and a chicken stock,the thick stock was a bit overpowering and the amount took away from the crispness of the dish(smaller prawns that had been peeled may have worked better).Overall it was a wonderful meal and I would be happy to return and try other dishes on the very interesting menu
2
We tried this place on Labour Day to celebrate my belated birthday. The food is quite nice but the staff service is horrible. As this is a ala carte buffet, so bear in mind please don't keep ordering or else they will be very hostile to you. They will also remind you that you have soup before so they won't be giving you other soup. They also will just put the food loudly on the table. Halfway through the meal, I realize my glass was cracked and I told them. Without any sorry they just change another glass.I have feedback to the asst director of F&B and he just said sorry to me and my friend. If we were to returned please call him. Which makes me think that they just wan to quickly let you go away

Located in the Fullerton Hotel in the heart of SIngapore's business district, Jade has been a long time favourite business dining venue for me when craving Chinese food.Apart from a central location, the restaurant also offers tasteful, elegant surroundings; and by Chinese restaurant standards, quite attentive and efficient service.There is a great choice of set lunches - generally 6/7 courses ranging in price from S$58++ to S$88++. This can add up quickly with drinks in larger groups, but its well worth it given he quality of the food. There is also a lunch time dim sum selection.This trip I had the Jade Menu for 68++ which offered a first course with a trio of appetitisers, seafood hot and sour soup, fish with foie gras, minced beef with eggplant, noodles and a fantastic dessert. Overall it was a great meal, service was efficient and we told them we needed to be done in 90 minutes and were ready to go in 80 minutes.I've been here many times over the years, generally never had a bad experience and enjoy going back

We went there and tried the dim sum buffet. 36$ per person and the quality was good. Not as good as the dim sum buffet of Mandarin Oriental (cherry Garden) but cheaper. I have been to a lot of dim sum and I am usually disappointed. This one is really a good value for money and if you are not on a large budget it definitely worth the try.

This Chinese restaurant in the Fullerton Hotel in Singapore was a great disappointment. We had recently eaten at Mei Jiang in Bangkok (Peninsula Hotel) and had a wonderful Chinese meal. We thought a first-class hotel like the Fullerton would have a comparable restaurant. There was nothing about the restaurant to recommend it. The wait staff seemed uninterested. When we asked for suggestions they were unhelpful. Wine by the glass ran about $20 US. We chose three entrÃ©es to share and all were disappointing. The chicken dish in particular was entirely inedible. It consisted of chopped up chunks of bone with small pieces of meat hanging on tendons. We were not even sure it was actually chicken! We ate several breakfasts and other meals in the Club at the Fullerton all of which were very good. We concluded that the hotel, itself, can produce good food, it was either a very bad night at this particular restaurant or something. I believe that Singapore has a lot better to offer

Tried the Peking Duck - loved the skin in the pancakes but not the fried rice made with the meat. Shrimp appetizer was unreal and the rest of our dishes recommended by our server were perfect!

We popped in for a meal on our way to South Africa last year and it was fantastic. So far generally speaking the average meal in Singapore has been brilliant.

FOOD WAS NEATLY PREPAred- noodles was yummy . dimsum reasonably priced and satff were extremely efficient,
3
The food was fine, looks great, just wish the dishes could be piping hot as Chinese cuisine should be.
4
The food was fresh, interesting twists to the preparation. Service is good too. A bit pricey but it is a hote restaurant.
5
This is not the place for quantity. But if you are looking for quality chinese fine dinning, this is the place. You need to make reservation though, espceially for business lunch.

The Jade Restaurant was the second restaurant I visited in Fullerton Hotel during my Singapore Trip in 2011 (The another one is the high-tea at the Courtyard), I've booked for their weekend dim sum brunch 4 months prior to my visit.There are 2 seating per day, each seating have 1 hour and 45 minutes for you, so you must be punctual if you want to try more dishes. There's a list of dim sum and other dishes for you to order during the period (with the exception of soup). I ordered over 10 dishes as you can see my photos I attached. They are still hot when they were served, the taste is good, but not distinctive, especially for a restaurant of a 5-star hotel...But if you want to enjoy a quiet and tasty lunch when you are in Singapore, I will recommend this place to you

The ambience of the place was good and you were in no doubt that this was a fine dining restaurant. It was however very cold and the aircon was brutal.The food was food - the Peking duck starter was good with a nice twist by the addition of orange peel. The hot and sour soup was very good and the winter melon soup was also delicately flavoured. These dishes were served very promptly, however after that there was a huge delay of almost 30 minutes before the rest arrived. It wasnâ€™t that the dishes were lengthy to prepare, (two types of fried rice, a steamed fish and beancurd and veggies), but it took 30 minutes.... the food when it arrived was good, but wait was unacceptable.There was also a distinct absence of staff when it came time to pay the bill.Nice place but the aircon was brutal and the sharp switch in service speed let it down

I find their Sunday dim sum buffet to be very good value. Best of all, we got to choose from an ala carte menu, so everything came freshly prepared. At SGD 36 a head, this is very good value. Everything was tasty. Service was a bit of a downer, though. Hardly any smile came from ANY of the staff. They all seemed unhappy, but we did not allow this ruin our afternoon. Wines and champagnes were ridiculously priced. We brought a bottle of champagne and were prepared to pay for corkage, but not SGD 78!! It was outrageous. Would be back only for the food. Don't expect friendly service.

I went to this restaurant a few weeks ago because my husband pointed out that he read good reviews about it so I thought... Why Not? We decided not to go to our favorite restaurant (which i'm going to review next) to try this one and it was a HUGE Disappointment!!! The food was cold and not so tasty + SMALL portions and HUGE bill.... the service was a little bit slow and they seem very distracted all night... we went on a saturday night and the place was practically empty!I do not recommend this place!!

One of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore. Settle for the fixed menu if you can't make up your mind.

Their Christmas day dinner was excellent, with a great menu.
5
all you can eat buffet menu... just great, peking duck delicious, dumplings freshly made and big choice of dishes
great food, great ambience and great service, price is fair
5
Terrific peking duck, though they serve it with orange which was a little different to what we've been used to. Very nice though. Meal was very reasonably priced for a restaurant in a 5 star hotel.
5
Nice chinese food! will recommend to everyone. must try the dimsums!! very hot and delicious!!
5
The peking duck as noted by other reviewers was exceptional. However, the crispy sea bass with honey and sesame seeds was truly stunning. Do not expect large helpings but do expect to enjoy every last morcel. A great meal
5
Been there a couple of times, including for lunch, dim sum, dinner.
The staffs are attentive and some staffs actually recongise us, even our previous visits were months apart. Tried their peking duck feast which was fantastic...
Will continue to go back there again.

I've been twice in Jade in April, then May this year. First time(April) was for a dinner; my husband was expecting a special dimsum menu which he had enjoyed earlier with colleagues for a business lunch. Unfortunately we discovered there was no such thing at night and that the menu prices tended indeed to rise quite high (above $100). Dinner was nice but not frankly exceptional. Service was nice. However we will probably not return there for dinner, as we both agreed that it was not good value for money and that there probably were much better restaurant in this price range in Sg. My rating for dinner at Jade would be 1 to 2 out of 5.Second time (May), we had booked a table for dimsum buffet on a weekend. If I remember right, we had a table for 11:30 am, as 1 pm service was full. The waiters were really nice and helpful; in fact one of them ordered for us a mix of everything, as we did not know which to choose - the selection was really good and there was enough, even if we believed it would not be enough during ordering (because so many other dimsums on the menu were not in the selection); the waiters also explained us which sauce to top which dimsum, all through the meal. Dimsums were really good and all ingredients tasted really fresh. Price was very reasonable, considering the product quality. One small drawback : there were many kids in the restaurant, widely running along the tables, as well as a few large tables; as a result, it was a noisy lunch and did not fully convey the impression of a cosy luxury hotel restaurant. We will definitely go back there for dimsum special lunch ! Rating would be then between 4 and 5

I have been regular to Jade restaurant since we discovered their dim sum lunch buffet last year. The dim sum there are very authentic, with great taste, expensive ingredients, and excellent service of course. The other dishes in the buffet menu are not bad, but I always don't have time for them as i wouldn't miss every dim sum items LOL. Do remember to book 2 weeks in advance as it's really popular

Celebrated Christmas Eve dinner at the Jade restaurant and the food was fantastic. There were nice personal touches as customised menus to indicate the host of the dinner in the menu displayed. The service staff was also excellent that evening. They were extremely attentive and provided high quality service as expected at a restaurant in a 5 star hotel.We ordered the set Christmas menus and the food although Chinese had some fusion influences. Standouts in the menu included Shark Fin soup, Pink Guava Sorbet with Champagne Jelly (to clear our pallettes), Sauteed sliced Turkey & Foie Gras and Lobster Noodles. The meal was highly memorable and a fantastic way to celebrate a special evening.It is definitely a great place for a special Chinese gourmet dinner. I look forward to returning to try their Dim Sum Buffett which always require a reservation

The main event restaurant in the expensive Fullerton Hotel. Large room, over-chilled, and when I went practically empty. High pretensions to style but the food was mundane and in very small portions. No perzazz or style.
5
Fabulous service at this restaurant and top cuisine to match.
We had the duck feast menu which was just mouthwatering good.
A great fine dining experience.

Signature Tuk Lok type

Had the seven course peking duck meal -- loved it -- service very attentive and well worth it
5
The preset peking duck meal is 58 S$ Great bargain. Very innovative. Thin wine list, common problem for Sing restaurants, but had Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir. 3 page tea menu (almost as long as the wine list). Very friendly staff.

The Dim Sum is really good. Great personalised service too!

Everything about Jade is just right. The staff have been trained to provide 1st class platinum service; the food is very good; and interesting and elegant food presentation for which I give top marks.The buffet is decent. If you are looking for a culinary experience, order from the a la carte menu.On the evening that I dined there, the patrons present read like a who's who directory in Singapore.Definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore
