Tucked away on the ground level of the Grand Hyatt, this is a lovely spot situated by the hotel's waterfall. Their offering during the high tea and dinner buffets may not seem like a huge spread when compared to the typical hotel buffets but certainly substantial enough and of high quality. Highly recommend it if you are looking for a relatively quiet and informal place to have a conversation without needing to shout above the din that is pervasive in many other restaurants!

We spent a very pleasant evening at 10 Scotts. Service was attentive, the buffet is simple and qualitative. We loved the warm and cold entree, the meat prepared on the spot, the panini, the wine. A special place highly recommendable

This place is simply amazing after the arrival of Myra the new lounge manager. She chat with us in her first week of working there and immediately took note that we love our wines. Upon our next visit, she saw us walking in from afar and immediately recommended us a lovely magnum. We appreciate a lot when service professionals are truly professional, and we do frequent 10Scotts a lot that you can see us there every month (at times as much as thrice a month). Christopher the leading service staff is a gem, he really knows how to always say yes all the time. Keep up the great work.

Read raving reviews about the high tea on various blogs. But it was just average. Range was limited, cheese taking up 1/4 of table, salad make your own another quarter, 3 types of baguette sandwiches another 1/4 and scones 2 types plus beef stew taking up the rest. In the oven was same types of scones just warm vs those cold on the table, then 3 types of savories -crab cake, curry puff and sausage rolls. Then there is 2 tier sweets - bottom tier is strawberries (sour), blueberries and raspberries and top tier has 6 different petite desserts, one piece each. Two persons get only one tier to share although the petite desserts are refillable. Scones substandard, quality average and range is absolutely disappointing. overall just not worth the $50pp price tag

10 Scotts, Singapore never fails to make me feel so comfortable and welcomed. My wife and I have countless beautiful memories of the place and the amazing staffs attending to us there.The managers and staffs will always try to attend to our needs even when the crowd there at times was simply madness, be it due to events of peak hours. We are very appreciative and touched by them without failed. And to be remembered every single time we return there is just gorgeous. Small little details like i fractured my ankle a month back and I happened to drop by for a meal during that period when my ankle was still in cast. The genuine concern showed by the managers and staff was really heart warming. And what is more amazing that follows is after my cast was removed they are still able to recall that I was the one who was injured a month ago. I think 10 Scotts of Grand Hyatt Singapore has just raised the benchmark of excellent services to a new height. Well done 10 Scotts and Grand Hyatt.

Good quality food and attentive service. Though the chairs around the circular table were a tad too soft! Great place to unwind and enjoy an afternoon tea
5
I had a wonderful moment with my family and was taken care by Myra, Allison and Pinky.They were very forthcoming and hospitable.I highly recommend this place
4
A regular there and always enjoyed the ambience especially the service.They introduced beef sliders (it's in the oven and safer to ask the chef for it) which is yummy. It's like a mini version of the delicious burgers they have at Mezza9. Also introduced pork for main course. Nice change . Still prefer the beef though :-) but nevertheless since I'm pretty regular the alternative is welcomed.The cold appetizers in the fridge has also improved. Now it's weekly rotation of prawns or japanese tuna with seaweeds. Both an improvement over the oysters.The quality of nuts are also fresher now. Pistachios, walnuts, macadamia . Not a fan of the ice cream though but the dessert tray at the end of the meal has become healthier with a nice selection of strawberries, raspberries, blue berries etc.The rest of the buffet is enjoyable as usual. Service staff is always attentive and friendly. Special mention is Rhea. Thanks 10 Scotts

Went to 10 Scotts for high tea with 2 of my girlfriends, had the champagne high tea set, came with free flow champagne, a cute high tea set piece and we could eat from the high tea buffet too. the food choices were superb, and interesting. Although the seafood section was lacking quite a bit. Guy infront of me took 5 oysters, and when it was my turn,there was only 2 oysters left in the bowl. Top up wasn't done , so i went back to my seat. It was a little pricey, but i guess it's quite the norm for high tea champagne session
5
Still my fav high tea place in Singapore. Food is refillable. Delicious food, good spread and value for money
5
Great place to chill or catch up with friends. Delicious food and value for money (with the alcohol) buffet. A gem in the heart of the busy Orchard Road
5
We visited on a Saturday evening for some after-dinner drinks. The service provided was on-point as we were attended to immediately after we stepped into the lounge. The place was beautifully decorated and well-maintained, despite the furniture being slightly dated. Kudos to the friendly service team for being efficient even though it was a busy weekend evening. Prices are very reasonable as compared to other five-star hotel lounges. I would love to revisit this place soon
5
Thanks you for your very good service and very delicious food.Thank you for service crew Myra delivery a very friendly service 
5
Casual good lunch with lots of choice of tea and coffee.High Standard of customer service (especially manager Ms Myra, who alwaus welcome us with nice smile
4
We keep coming back for the high tea because it's the best value in town. It's also the only free flow champagne high tea! Food selection is great - there is a buffet for all the savoury foods (including hot meals cooked by a chef on the spot, sushi/sashimi, cheese, cold cuts, pastries, salads, oysters), and then you get the tiered stand of desserts delivered to your table. Service is slow, and is always disappointing when they give you "last pour" of the free flow champagne 30 MINUTES BEFORE the end of the seating!
5
Afternoon tea at 10 Scotts is always our favourite. We are always served a 3 tier of dessert (which is refillable) and we can also choose from the selection of food at the counter. The selection is not huge but sufficient. My favourite are the oysters and scones and my husband loves whatever the cook served.
4
The place was nicely spaced and served with quality food. Will definitely return again. Love the crab cakes and scones.
4
Very nice setting like u r having tea at ur own home. Nice food as well. The only bad part is that there are 2 entrances to the place & there isnâ€™t any hostess at the entrance so that u know which is the correct entrance. I stood there looking like a lost child dunno which table to go to. Other than that, nice place to have a nice high tea
4
A ideal location for a great business discussion or a quite cuppa tea during the day or sip a drink in the evening
5
Great ambience, decor and service. The buffet line starts off with a cheese platter with grapes and melon by the side. The bite sized burgers were adorable and delicious. The sushi and sashimi was always replenished and kept fresh! We even discovered Oysters in the fridge. Needless to say it was a comprehensive spread, one that is immensely satisfying with the mini tarts and fruits in the tray that was refillable! The staff were polite and sweet, ensuring that all is satisfactory! A definite good place to bask in a lazy afternoon :)
3
Came for high tea last Saturday to celebrate a friend's birthday. The selection is very very limited (borderline sad) for that price.1) Oysters were not plump, quite the opposite, some are almost a thin film. Had one which was very fishy and had diarrhea from it the next day2) Mini burger buns were quite stale.3) Scones were excellent with clotted cream and jam4) Dessert tray was limited and most items were too sweetSeem quite short staffed, plates were not cleared regularly, but happy that the champagne pours were frequent enough.Champagne was worth the $35++ top up but the food is really subpar in terms of overall range and quality, save for some items
4
Fantastic! ✨ we originally reserved for afternoon tea as I am a tea addict and I was craving for lil sweet treats. In fact, 10Scotts also served various light food, e.g. sushi, fresh oyster, tuna, parma ham, cheese, panini and so forth. Good vibe, good ambient, excellent hospitality, nice interior decor. I would kindly suggest to make reservation a few days prior to your visit as they busy there
5
We went for afternoon tea from noon-2:30pm. The buffet offered oysters, salad, sushi, cheese, sandwiches, warm food, scones, ice cream and other things. The choices were just amazing, everything tasted simply delicious. The champagne classes were refilled in due time. It was a great experience and excellent value for money
5
Second time back here. Great food, with a really good selection of a bit of everything. Topped off with Great service and they even surprised my Friend with a mini decadent chocolate cake for her birthday.
4
Not bad. Couples can consider visiting this place if they want a chill place to visit and have high tea.
4
The lunch buffet has limited items, and almost no local dishes, but what’s there is fresh - salads, oysters, a few sandwiches, 2 kinds of sashimi and 1 sushi, 2 kinds of cheese, fruits, scones; hot items include a soup, a pan fried dish made to order, excellent crab cakes, good curry puffs. Service is swift and pro-active, by far the best among all the outlets we’ve been to at the Grand Hyatt (Straits Kitchen, mezza9). If you have the Hyatt Club card and there are only two diners, the 50% discount makes the lunch outstanding value
4
Been a regular here. Recently they have improved the buffet offerings. Namely there is beef and tuna on some nights at the cook station. The cheese spread always good with bread and soup.Got rid of the oysters and now there is quiche in the oven. Prawn cocktails is a new addition. Not m favorite though. The prawns a bit small and sometimes a bit tough. Sorry Hyatt.And there is fresh strawberries, blueberries and cherry on the night I went . Good. They've cut down on the sweets which is fine by me. Hey our PM said there is a war on diabetes..LOL.Staff service always great since we've been regular and know all the staff by name and they've returned the courtesy of remembering ours. Great staff ! Overall nice and cosy evening 
5
Fabulous value at $50++. Sure you might pay less for 30 more items on the buffet at other restaurants but the offerings here are quality stuff. From the salads, to the soup, the cheese and the mains offered. Definitely quality over quantity. The additional $35++ for free-flow of their listed wines is also amazing, and service is impeccable! The whole ambience of the restaurant is relaxed chic and we were already picking a date to come back before we left for the evening.
5
@TheKuoKnowsLooks can be deceptive. 10 Scotts might not have the yards and yards of buffet food on display like its peers. But what it has is top quality.There is as much Melon and Parma Ham that you can possibly eat. Same goes for Smoked Salmon. And there are shucked Oysters galore.There is a Dish of the Day. In my case it was Beef Stew - very rich, very tasty and very satisfying. Great comfort food.Cheese lovers will not be disappointed. There are more cheeses than I could name. And that's before three tiers of desserts are brought to the table. Do leave room for sonescones, though.10 Scotts has discovered the secret of a good buffett. You don't need lots of food - just make sure what you offer is top notch
4
They've recently revamped their operations and offerings. Not as generous as before, but still pretty ok. Nice soft ambience
4
We arrived early and were promptly settled down. Nice quiet place for a quick business meeting. Will return again to try their afternoon tea
4
My family visited 10 scotts for the afternoon high tea and the variety and quality of food is great! Service could be improved though. There is no designated host/reception area and we were left standing in the middle of the restaurant for quite some time before being shown to our table.
3
I went for hi-tea with a group of friends, catching-up on things. We sat at 3pm and order our drinks and helped ourselves to the buffet. A friend of us had been reminding the waiter/waitress 3 times to send us the 2-tier dessert glass stand to be sent (comes with the hi-tea). As we sat and sipped our coffee/tea, the dessert stand still hasn't arrive. At 4pm I requested for the manager who quickly got the dessert stands sent to us. I can see they are understaffed and not attentive. Since the dessert stand is part of the hi-tea package and it is missing from our table, the staff should have checked. After 1 hour to receive our dessert tray is ridiculous! The sofa in the lounge was just too low, torn and stained. I expected better quality, both in service and furnishings from a Grand Hyatt! Disappointing
3
They use to serve the savory and sweets on a tray and you could go select other items from the buffet area. However, now, they only serve the sweets. It's a different feel. FoodThe sandwiches are pretty good. Dont really recall the names of the 3 types that were being served. But i think there was one with egg mayo infused with truffle. That was good. They started serving this vietnamese wrap as well. It tasted light and refreshing. Oysters are in the side fridge. Fresh and plump. Their curry puff and crab meat cake seemed to have changed in flavour. Used to order for refills but now, only took one serving from the buffet table. did not finish it. They have a special item that is prepared on the spot. Beef with sauce. Take it at the start. The taste seemed diluted towards the end of the service. The sweets were average. nothing outstanding. Give the kaya a try. it matches well with the scones. The scones are heated up upon ordering. Teas served are pretty good. From TWG. The ice cream varies in flavour. They had saffron, chendol and pistachio the day i went. The saffron is a little unique and i would say it is an acquired taste. not to my liking. The chendol was good. Not too sweet. Did not try the pistachio. Would probably visit this place only after a long absence
4
Very pleased with the quality of food as well as the variety. We weren't expecting such a spread of savory items, given that it's a high tea session. Nevertheless, the taste of the pastries and cakes could be improved as most of the sweets were maxed out on sugar
4
Pros 1) Quiet and relaxing atmosphere2) Tea menu is great ( especially passion de fleur)3) High end and posh dinning experienceCons 1) Service crews seems emotionless2) Limited spread in terms of foo

Was there with my family in the joy of celebrating my granddaughter 8th month and the intention to book the place for her 1 year old birthday.Vanessa show us to the table and when we asked for other al carte menu, she bought us the snacks menu but we mentioned we like the other menu too. She bought over another but gave a smirk ! One member asked for Pete's Place menu - she bluntly says dont have. My daughter and her husband have been there been there several times but with a couple that frequent the place - they had order food from Pete's Place. Before we finished our meal - a hostess came over with the dessert plate and says last order for coffee; told her we are finish our meal yet - another hostess that stood closeby spoke loudly and says" we are serving dessert now and if you need more we can top-up later" - anyhow they still bought 1 serving of dessert for 3 of us that was having buffet while in the midst of dining! 1 or 2 pastries of each item on the tray for 3 person :(1. Inconsistency service - if you are there with people the staff knows.....?2. Service sequences for serving desserts and coffee?3. Dessert quantity serve for 3 person?4. Speaking to guests from a distance to mention that items can be "top-up" - rude and embarrassing to guests
5
We returned to 10 Scotts for a dinner last Saturday. Being a Saturday night, the place was buzzing as usual.Thanks to Vanessa and Nicholas running the show, there was a constant positive vibes in the place throughout the night!Despite it being a full house, they managed to maintain their warmth and friendliness towards all the guests (both regulars and otherwise) whilst running the whole floor.They were (very) efficient in their duties and still managed to anticipate the needs of many (almost all) diners and guests; the latter being the trigger for me to write them this compliment.Vanessa and Nicholas aside, the buffet spread, though not the widest of variety, remains fresh with the main course cooked on the spot (and kindly delivered to your table if the chef is not too busy)The dessert tray always works a treat, the champagne chilled perfectly and there was a decent selection of wine to keep us going for the night.So thank you Vanessa and Nicholas. Thank you for loving your jobs! See you guys again, soon
5
My Wife and I were celebrating my birthday. The food was great, the people was great too. To my surprise, they even presented me with a birthday cake. Wonderful experience.
4
Had dinner on a saturday evening there. Nice and quiet . Good ambience and attentive service. Reasonably good food for the price of $45++. Six good cheeses to choose from, simple salad spread, a few bread selection , a small cook section. Just a little of each to satisfy the stomach. Free flow of orange and guava juice. Finishing off with a petite selection of desserts on a tray complemented with a wide selection of teas and coffee. Pretty good way to spend a relatively quiet evening . And if you like a tipple, the magnums go for as low as $110 and champagne $150 !Go for it but don't tell too many people ;-) 
5
Great service, cosy ambience. The selection of food for high-tea was small, but quality was assured. From some of the best cheeses (blue cheese a must try) to the wonderful scones (the cream is to die for), and added bonus of oysters. Also, desserts did not disappoint. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a fairly affordable buffet setting that won't burst your belly, and let you concentrate on catching up with whoever is in your company

Was at gym to sign up for fitness membership and well serviced by veteran ms Jennifer Toh who recognized me as old member of the old chinoiserie and member of the fitness club many years back ! Wow what great memory !! Then in way down we decided to have a drink and just swayed into 10 Scotts. Had wine and the Filipina staff in duty yesterday 6 ish pm had a great attitude. Service was very nice. Later we took a look at the buffet and my my at the price of $45 ++ the spread was wonderful. I had oysters then salad then cheese and a soup to start with. They tasted very nice and healthy. Then we chose chicken as the day meat was prawn. But we had seafood too much last few days. The chicken breast meat was tender and nice too. Then we were asked when we wanted our dessert !! My stomach was so full it was impossible to have dessert. Ordered a tea and came the dessert tray !! See the picture !!! Tasted yummy too. overall very satisfied with the quality of service and food !! Keep it up guys. John chin.
4
A nice relax ambience, a perfect place for a catch-up with friends over a good quality tea and snacks
5
The food quality was good and the crowd was also not rowdy and too greedy. Waitress has impeccable services
4
Went for high tea with champagne on a weekday. Book online with hungry go where but sad to say restaurant did not have my reservation. Fortunately it's a week day and there's more then enough seats available.The staff was pleasant and quickly arrange a table. There is 2 rounds for high tea. 12pm to 2.30pm and 3pm to 5pm. We were there at 2.50pm. We were told we can't start till 3pm. This is Grand Hyatt. Very surprise how they treated their customers. Do not expect a 5 Star hotel to behave in such a manner. Consolation, The staff are very efficient and top up out champagne glasses regularly, and very attentive. Food is not bad but it's the same old same old. Been there several times over several years and food variety didn't seem to change much.
5
Used the Biz ctr. Excellent service from your staff, Ms Rhea. Very helpful and polite. Even during busy time, she handled and coordinated well, giving consistent service to everyone. I am writing this comment because it's rare to receive good service these days, and HYATT always receives my highest mark. Thank you for great service and providing wonderful staff to compliment HYATT and customers! And meeting today Ms Joemie, wonderful too
4
Nice place for a high tea at the Grand Hyatt Singapore. Good service but the buffet spread just okay. Nice ambient and comfortable seating.
5
Enjoyed a wonderful evening at 10 Scotts tonight under the care of Nicholas and team!We were given the best attention despite it being a busy night. Our requests were responded to quickly and with the friendliest service! We felt very much at home during our visit. Food and drinks were top notch.Would definitely recommend 10 Scotts for a perfect place to unwind and relax
4
10 Scotts free flow no longer! This was the best place in town for great food and a fantastic free flow to catch up with friends, visitors and work colleagues..... Please go back to the way it was, it was much more fun and atmospheric, I think you will find you will loose a lot of us with this change. The food is still delicious and high tea is great if thats your thing, just bring back our free flow nights
5
Awesome food!!! All singapore local food spread at one place. Tastes really delicious. Many varieties of local desserts and they are really yummy. Hats off to the Chef for the delicious crab, loved it. Must try 
5
Good food, superb service, thanks Nicholas for the hospitality. Very cosy at 10 scotts, always hang out here with my friends, very cosy. Highly recommended
5
Excellent service! The staff make you feel like a VIP guest and attend to your needs. I had a great high tea there
5
Visited 10 Scotts with a group of friends for dinner. Was served by Nicholas. He was very friendly and made excellent recommendations for food and drinks. Will definitely return again
5
Lovely evening at 10 Scotts. Kudos to Nicholas and Myra, for a memorable evening, once again....Professional with alacrity and sincerity...Food was excellent. Drinks (wine and champagne) were better.No wonder why it's always buzzing here in the afternoons and evenings
5
My friends were planning to go Mezza9 martini bar but since it was full, we went to 10 Scotts at level 1 instead. To our delight, Myra and Nicholas provided us with excellent service and set the scene for a very heartwarming gathering for us. He was even able to accommodate my vegetarian friends with good quality food deserving mention.
4
Indulge yourself once in a while! Delicious luxurious spread with free flow artisan teas and coffee. The beef is really good - melts in your mouth.
5
I would highly recommend to all. Nice place to meet and relax for high tea. It's in Orchard Rd and near to all shopping
5
The food was fantastic, bettered only by the excellent service.I had high-tea at 10 Scotts with my Mum, Sister and her two children, one of whom has food allergies. I informed the staff during my reservation and also mentioned it when I first arrived at the restaurant.I was pleasantly surprised when one of the waitstaff brought a selection of curated food, free of allergens for my nephews. Most of the items were from the buffet selection, but they were kind enough to also include some smoked salmon which was not available otherwise.As always, the savoury food (especially the oysters and crab cakes) and the drinks were fantastic. Their scones (warmed up) with clotted cream and jam are always enjoyable. Dessert this time included delicious fresh berries together with the usual selection of cakes and pastries. I may have been too full to enjoy the dessert properly, but the berries were certainly well received
4
We love all of the F&B outlets in Hyatt. We came here for a light snack and some cocktails after having lunch in the restaurant at Mezza9. The staff is always friendly and very helpful. Manager Vanesa runs and impeccable space that is casual, classy and enjoyable. Get the cold cuts and cheese platter and also the satay which is maybe among the best in Singapore (unfortunately also the most expensive in Singapore).
4
If crowded lounges aren't your thing, 10 Scotts may work well for you. Otherwise go upstairs to the Martini Bar.Seating is well spaced so you get some privacy. The clientele is mostly couples or groups of 4 so it doesn't get rowdy.We (2 of us) were persuaded to get a magnum bottle of red (petit Corbin -Aspagne 2012 St Emilion grand cru) and did not regret it. It went very well with the buffet spread which features quality selections (not extensive but very adequate. Cheeses, preserved meats, oysters (yes!), crab cakes (delicious!), flaky curry puffs (yum!), duck rolls (very good!), and a few more. There's also a couple of hot dishes if you like, prepared on demand - last night it was chicken so it didn't catch my fancy. We spent a good 2 hours there just chatting and loved it. The very attentive service staff made us feel very welcome and they all seemed genuinely to see / serve us
4
Great for a light coffee or tea break. Comfortable seating. Can be a little noisy when larger groups are at the tables
5
Fabulous Sunday Brunch experience at Mezza9. Would recommend to all, it's a must do if spending time in Singapore.
4
Was there for dinner . Like the quiet ambience, spaciousness and attentive service. For $45 ++ it is pretty reasonably priced for its limited food spread but they do have free flow fresh OJ and Guava juice and a nice cheese spread. It's not for the usual hotel buffet eaters. For that you can go to their Straits Kitchen .There is a light main course for the evening cooked fresh at the station . For those who are watching their waist line but enjoy a simple buffet priced reasonably in a quiet environment, it's not bad. And there's free flow of a decent range of exotic teas and the usual coffee choices
1
I cant explain how disappointed we were when we went for high tea. Booked it weeks before could have gone any where but chose 10 scotts. There is no vast buffet as advertised or items do not come on the trays, according to the waitress all that has changed and the only things that now come to the table are the sweet items. It was dark and totally lacked atmosphere, I'm still annoyed writing this review. For the first time in my life I walked out of a restaurant I was not happy, if things have changed review your web site!!!
4
My daughter and I had a wonderful time at 10 Scott's. The attentive staff never failed to fill your cup with aromatic coffee. Incredibly delighted by the amazing menu, consisting of both sweet and savory items. Everything is bite-size, nice and zestful.
5
I've been to a few high teas in Singapore but none can compare to the impeccable service that 10 Scotts provides. The reservation process was smooth and the guy was very detailed in his explanation about the reservation and the costs involved. As I'm currently 28 weeks pregnant, the staff exceeded to my requests for a table seat as well as a pillow, which I am most grateful for. All the service staff during the high tea experience was perfect: they not only gave us good explanations about what the menu offered, they also cleared our plates promptly and refilled our drink orders. I would like to single out 2 particular service staff, Rhea and Chef Jeff. Rhea was most courteous in her service towards us and very bubbly and cheerful, the kind of role model service staff should emulate after.:) Chef Jeff was possibly one of the best chefs I've ever met - he went through what the buffet items were (he did this for almost anyone who walked by the buffet counter), cooked the best fillet steaks possible and served it personally to all his guests and made it possible for me to savour the freshly shucked oysters in the safest way
5
Went to 10 @ Scotts for after work drinks with colleagues. Nice cosy place with excellent service. Your service staff in attendance, Vanessa and Tak are affable and attentive. Prices are reasonable too. Nice experience all round
5
We visited 10 Scott's on February19 2017 for their Afternoon Tea. The variety of food may not be much to most, but the quality of each a la carte is superb. It seems like they follow a "less is more" concept, and it really works well for them. We have been to numerous Afternoon Teas here in Singapore but most offer very bland selections, or try to occupy their tea rack with poor quality confections & savories. This is not the case with 10 Scott's. If you're looking for quality over quantity with a nice and comfortable atmosphere, you will love this place!And many kudos to our waiter Sandy, she was absolutely lovely and provided excellent service. We will definitely be back. :
5
I am in love with this place! The service here is excellent & the food is great. Our server Rhea was awesome & quick in attending to our requests. Came here to celebrate my fiance's birthday and they came out with a cake & sang him a song. It was special. Would definitely recommend this place for special occasions or even just a meal for a relaxing day
4
I traveled to Singapore for a cruise trip, while returning home, i had a stay over at 10 Scotts Road Grand Hyatt, my allover experience was amazing
5
We arrived at 10, Scotts at Hyatt for its reputation for High Tea and it was a great experience again. It was a busy Christmas afternoon, but the team was kind enough to accommodate us without advance booking. The Champaign, the seafood, the pasta, the Cheese collection, the Christmas cakes and pastries, and everything was great. The restaurant team made it a great experience through their generosity and personal attention. A must try place
5
We had the pleasure of enjoying the High Tea at 10 Scotts today during the 3pm sitting. We celebrated my mother's birthday in style and enjoyed the free-flow tea/coffee and amazing delights on offer. There was such a wide and delicious selection of sweet and savoury dishes on offer and the oysters and hot dishes were also impressive.The ambience is exactly as described by others and the view of the waterfall is certainly impressive.The staff are outstanding! From settling us in to constantly ensuring that our place settings were cleared promptly, we were very pleased with the efforts of everyone, especially the delightful Sandy.The staff also sang my mother happy birthday and brought out a mud cake with candle.Certainly an experience to remember and highly recommended. We will certainly be back when we are next in Singapore.
4
10 Scott's has a cosy living room feel to the place which together with its warm lighting has the right setting for a cosy afternoon tea with friends or family. You get a three tier tray of savoury food (sandwiches, cold soup, crab cakes and curry puffs) and a buffet spread of sweet and savoury items including a pretty decent cheese section and oysters from the cool section behind the buffet counter.The scones are the highlight of this place - buttery and flaky in the right way. They are served with pride with your choice of butter, clotted cream, raspberry jam and kaya. I was offered a warm scone from straight from the oven by the server at the counter which was a lovely bonus. Service is friendly and attentive. The ladies who run this place are constantly on the look out to clear your used plates and offer fresh ones. We were also asked a number of times if we wanted anything topped up from our tiered selection of food.
4
Love the waterfall view outside of the restaurant and Xmas decorations within! Definitely a great place for catch up with girlfriends. It was consider a variety of spread for high tea with oysters servings.
5
The sound of the waterfall transported us to another place. The free flow of wine elevated the oysters and conversation. Great to catch up with old friends.
1
Was surprised to find such rude and arrogant service at the Hyatt, as that's not usually my impression.A busy lounge is understandable, but staff with absolutely no interest in finding us a table, despite several being open and not reserved. Most saddening was the rude manner in which it was done
5
10 Scotts is a lovely place to chill with my girlfriends. We like the spread that is just nice and the cozy ambience that you can chill in comfort.
5
This is my favorite restaurant in the world. So many choices and so many delights, I have been here many times over the years and it just keeps getting better. The food is superb and never disappoints.Come early because it gets crowded and reservations go fast.
4
A great high tea. It isn't cheap but you still get your money's worth. A variety of sweet and savoury. You can also get some cooked meals. Scones are really nice with the clotted cream and raspberry jam. Lots of cheese to choose from as well as sushi. For special occasions only.
3
My husband and I have tried a few different afternoon teas in Singapore and I'm afraid this isn't the best one.Afternoon starts from 3pm to 5pm and is $48++.There is a buffet of cakes, sushi, main course freshly cooked, cheese and oysters.They also bring over the stand of different nibbles which they will fill up for you as many times as you like.There is an option to upgrade and have free flow wine or free flow champagne. There is also a selection of different teas and coffees.They food was ok, but it was just missing something
4
My daughter and I indulged in afternoon tea. We were treated to a lavish buffet in addition to the tray of goodies. Desserts, meats, cheeses, Asian delights including some sushi. A diverse assortment.
4
Service was great and food quality is consistent. Definitely a place to bring the old folks as well as they serve hot food items as well. Desserts were to die for.....

if you have a group of friends and are looking for a good night you can't go wrong with 10 Scotts! Have been many times to the free flow dinner. Great champagne and for those who don't there is red/white wine or beer. Chilled environment and a good selection of cheeses/cured meats and desserts to ensure that your stomach is satisfied too! Friendly staff who ensure that your glass is full. A good evening which usually leads to more
4
Exiting mix of dishes for a High Tea with a lot of Singaporean Dishes along with the usual Sandwiches and scones. Nice desserts.
5
The After 6 dinner buffet at 10 Scotts was a very relaxing affair with good food and great drinks variety. Opt for the champagne package which was a rare find for dinner buffet, it also came with choices of red and whites, beer, TWG Tea, Coffee and juices! Service was prompt; drinks topped up 'mysteriously'. As usual I could never get tired of the crab cakes that I ate two wholes for myself. I would have expected some more changes in the desserts as I spotted similar items again from my past visits. The peach sorbet though was a new surprise which I adored
4
Had dinner at 10 Scotts last Saturday. Have always found the ambiance cozy. While the food offering is not extensive, guests can always ask for more of their preferred items from the the tiered tray if they like them - thereby preventing food wastage. The selection of cakes is sufficient; not to mention the fresh oysters and enticing homemade ice-cream :) Options for food only or with free flow of wine or/and champagne are available too
4
Being in the Grand Hyatt, this restaurant also has classy atmosphere. But actually, this restaurant opens to the general public, we saw many casual wear guests
4
A great end to a wonderful time in Singapore. Prior going to the airport we decided to treat ourselves to a High Tea and decided on 10 Scotts. This was a good choice as everything was freeflow and there was a far better selection that anyone could imagine. I would recommend this over the original 3 tier High Tea. Excellent venue excellent food
4
The buffet bar spread is pretty limited and most of the items didn't have a label, except for cheese bar, but if you throw in the spread on the 2-tier glass stand that's served at table, that make it all worth it! You can request for multiple rounds of those served on the 2-tier stand as well. The good: crab cake, curry puff, beef fillet, siew mai. oysters are very fresh as well but small, and kept in the fridge behind the cheese and cold cut bar which one could easily miss. The spread of cheese is very good as well. the tart based desserts are worth a try too. The can-do-without: the beetroot soup (it tasted terribly weird!). Some waygu beef roll served on the 2-tier was disappointing too, the skin was too thick to even taste any beef.overall a very good high tea experience in a comfortable setting and we had many rounds of the "good". unlimited tea and coffee and we could ask for change of tea flavor. One thing to note, despite calling in advance to inform that we need a wheelchair accessible seat, we were give couch seats which makes it difficult not only in transfer but also in convenient to get to the buffet bar. thankfully there were still table seats available nearer to the buffer counter and the restaurant did a swap for us.
4
Great ambience and quality of food, although the spread was not a lot for a buffet. My boyfriend had the Club at the Hyatt card so it only costed around $20++ per pax which was really value for money. But the normal price would cost around $40++, good for special occasions if you need great ambience and privacy
5
The place was well spaced out, making you feel like you're in your own home. Service was good, although a little slow due to insufficient staff. But food was exquisite & I enjoyed the variety of drinks available :)
4
The spread/variety wasn't as wide as we expected it to be, given the price of the buffet. Also, no tags were placed for the food, and we had to ask the service staff/chefs what was it. I would have expected a small cake for the birthday person when i indicated it was for a birthday celebration when i made my reservation, but nothing was done (something that other hotels/bistros/restaurants will always have when I indicated it as a birthday celebration or anniversary).
4
I went to this place after making reservation.It was nice and cosy nice place.There is a buffet consisting of dim sum , sushi , mini steak, cheese, and many sweet savoury .Plus free flow of champagne and 2 tier stand which consist of not-too sweet stuff. ( that is very good ) and pot of tea of your choice.Total price is $100.05 for weekend if you want free flow of champagne
3
Cosy lounge with simple buffet spread of cheese, nuts, cold cuts, oyster and a tray of savoury items in small portions. You can choose items you like to refill. The night we were there they were servicing steak and potatoes, which changes daily. Unfortunately, my Friend & I don't take beef and there is no options. Nevertheless, potatoes was tasty. We had the buffet with champagne at $85++. Good value for money.Juices, coffee & tea with selections of flavour are part of the buffet.Lady Manager was quite arrogant though, while the Korean servicing staffs are wonderful & helpful
3
The lounge is good and has a nice ambience to it. The chairs are a tad uncomfortable even though they look nice - both the low leather sofas and the higher wooden chairs. The food is more like dinner than good tea fare. No nice sandwiches on offer!The main problem is the tea. The tea pots retain the tea leaves in a strainer at the top rather than allow the tea leaves to circulate freely in the water and then gradually settle at the bottom. Spoiled my Darjeeling tea completely - way to light! SadNo idea why this venue is so popular. I for one am not going back!
5
excellent.. service was exceptionally great.. food was in tip top quality.. will definitely come back again.
4
A good bar - but a rather standard hotel bar. Some good cocktails and the food is good, but the atmosphere is a bit generi
5
We took our young kids for the High Tea on a Saturday afternoon. Everyone was happy with their drinks and blown away by the desserts. I appreciated the fact that steaks, cooked perfectly, were also part of the deal
3
Not a bad place for some good tea or a cocktail with very limited food choices except if you go for the buffet in the evening
4
Came here on a Thursday with a girlfriend for the regular hi-tea. The ambience is not too bad, and they have a good selection of tea. Their mocha is really delicious! It was very rich and fragrant. The food was also not too bad. Apart from the tiered savouries, they also have a buffet service station where you can pick desserts and scones, sushi, bread and cheese, soup as well as shucked oysters. I felt that the oysters were very small but overall it was still a good visit
2
We like the ambiance but service is rather unacceptable given the reputation of the hotel. I had to walk to the buffet area before a lady came forward. I was seated for a good 5 mins before I was given the drink menu. Obviously lack of manpower. Food was average. I doubt I will pay the price for the service & food again
2
Went for afternoon high tea. It was pricy but service is poor and food is just so so. We entered the restaurant but there was no reception. We walked in to find a lead waitress who seems to have a hard day. No smile. KO greeting. Though she found us a table and she accommodate our request for change, the service stops there. We have to seek out another person to explain how the high tea works - free flow specialty tea, buffet spread etc. Even then, it was a curt introduction. The food and quality was marginal.. Nothing special..Disappointed.
4
Sofas. In one word, that's why I love the Grand Hyatt high tea. The entire place feels like a giant living room. And you can't eat dinner on a sofa, so you know this place was designed entirely around the most unnecessary meal of the day, high tea. Which just makes you feel like so luxe! The curry puffs are awesome, popiah is up there, service a bit wonky (esp at this price point) but feel free to ask the staff for a constant stream of food and coffee like I did because hey, you're royalty here.
2
Went for high tea on a Sunday at a price of $53++ per pax. Good thing is there is unlimited refill of the tea and coffee and you can change your beverage.As many has highlighted previously, there is no one to greet you at the entrance so you have to hunt down a staff to ask about your seating.The spread of the high tea was dismal. Popiah was ok; similar to those in hawker centre. The sushi was terrible; the rice was like barely defrosting. I had better sushi from supermarket. The oysters were placed at a different area from the lemons and Tabasco; the lemons and tabasco were placed near the scones. The ham platter were running out quite often and you have to wait for refill.The live station prepared quite yummy prawns but 1) the staff cannot cope with e orders so sometimes your orders may be forgotten unless u stand there to wait for your orders to be cooked and 2) they ran out of prawn mid way through the buffet -.- replaced by chicken which is very dry meat.The 2 tier stand had yusheng as first tier due to CNY. Yusheng was good with thicker slices of salmon than those on the sushi. There is those bread with prawn on the lower tier but the bread is like rock hard. Curry puff is nice. Its really a very mediocre high tea for such a high price tag so I will not be going back
4
Great place for people who wanna chill and enjoy light food. Low varieties of food but great ambience!
5
Quiet at night to wind down for a cup of tea if you're not up for alcohol (but they just as well serve any beverage really); there's a great variety of gourmet tea not just in tea bags but with actual ingredients visible. The space is nicely designed with different sections so you can either chill on a sofa or be seated at a table to enjoy proper dining. There's also a private area that is ideal for casual afternoon parties or get-togethers.
3
Aft reading many gd reviews abt this place, my friends and I decided to try the High Tea. Although the service was prompt, had a good range of teas to choose from, the food left much to be desired. Other than the mini chocolate & caramel tart and the prawn mayo sandwich, the other items like (curry puff, scones, macarons, minestrone soup, popiah, etc) were mediocre. Unlikey to return and recommend to friends or family
4
Been here a couple of times and I thoroughly enjoyed the food from the two-tier stand especially the refillable crispy curry puffs and crabilicious crab cakes! The live station featured pan fried ham which was served hot with flesh smokily tender. The desserts consisting of red velvet cakes and many others was enough to fill me up. The bottomless choice of TWG tea and juices available was bound to make one (me!) spoilt for choice too! Overall, affordably priced for a high tea in a five star hotel
5
The service, menu spread at this restaurant was quite amazing...they even had an elaborate Indian spread of roti dhall, raita, sabji, dosa with sambhar and chutney, chole masala..stuffed paranta was also there....Must go place while in Singapor
4
Went for the dinner buffet recently. Good ambience with dim lights (in the private-ish room we had). Food was okay, if not exceptional. Decent choice of wines; champagne. Overall nothing wrong with the experience, if not exactly memorable. A much better option exists at 190 (at the Four Seasons), which is also more reasonably priced
5
Chef Shahnaaz cooks the bestest flambe peppercorn chicken fillet! Succulent & Delicious, just like fine dining! Definitely coming back in December to celebrate life and savour more surprises with friends & colleagues! Très bien
4
First time at 10 Scotts for high tea. No one greeted us when we entered, but the staff quickly checked if we had a booking and ushered us to our seats. We requested to have one with table of normal height as the table we were offer were a bit too low. Staff was helpful with our request, ushered us to a new table very quickly after checking if the space was available.The two-tiered stand was good, but took some time for it to arrive. Crab cake was very good, but had little bits of (soft) shell in it. Buffet spread did not have a lot of choice, but it was generally decent, nothing that I would complain about. One thing the management should look into would be to include some label to tell us what juice/food was being served. In addition, the chef was working hard at the live section, but I don't think she was able to handle the crowd that day. Orders kept coming in and you had to be alert and careful to take your order once the chef is done with the dish. Maybe the management can think of a system to ensure that customers who order will receive their orders. I found the oysters to be fresh, but did no see any vinaigrette or lemons to go along with it. Disappointingly, sorbet was not available when I visited, I really wanted to try their sorbet.Overall, I was happy with this experience, although it can be a bit pricy and 2 hours is really too short a duration. Perhaps the management can consider extending it to 2 and a half hours instead
4
The restaurant made some slight changes to the variety of savoury food. Some savoury food was placed at the buffet counter together with the desserts which used to be served on a two-tier tray (can be replenished) . The beef was very tasty. A great experience overall. Will definitely visit again soon

For S$43 per head at a 5-star restaurant, the service and food wasn't great.I booked this place for an informal business discussion and there were 4 of us. I was held up and came 30mins late. No staff attended to me at the entrance and so I walked in to look for my guests and colleague who were already seated. Finally found them and sat down. They had already been served drinks and food from the 3-tiered tray. After 15mins or more, no service staff came to ask if I would like a drink. When I got hold of a service staff to order a drink, I asked what do they serve, she rattled coffee, tea, juices...instead of showing me the menu. So I ordered a tea. She asked what kind of tea would I like and I asked what kind of tea do they serve, she started to rattle off again. She only brought a menu to me after I ask. Finally, decision made to go with an iced-chocolate drink. When the iced-chocolate drink was served, it looked diluted, upon drinking, it tasted nothing closed to a good old-fashioned iced-chocolate. I think Coffee Beans' tasted better.During our entire 2 hours there, our 3-tiered tray was never refill. The scones were a little hard (St Regis' ones were better) but the rest of the food on the tray were decent. There were some live food stations that we didn't get to eat from as we were busy chatting. So for 3 cups of tea, 1 iced-chocolate and 1 3-tiered tray of food, it costed us S$220 (though no fault of the hotel that we didn't get up to have the food from the live stations). Overall, I would not recommend this place for a business discussion/meeting. The service was less than satisfactory.

Hi, we are from Europe. This is our first visit to 10 Scotts, in Singapore. We frequent other Hyatt properties worldwide. 10 Scotts is very cozy, it feels like an upscale Swiss chalet, with wooden finishing. You definitely have a beautiful ambiance with the right lighting and what makes the difference is your Chef Shahnaaz Russell Wong. We rarely come across such energetic, knowledgeable, gregarious personality. She cooked the chicken breast with masala wine sauce to perfection, the sauce was well reduced, the seasoning was well balanced, presentation was delightful. All elements were perfect! We are very impressed with her interactive approach, when asked, what makes her different, she said, her passion for food and that her education at Le Cordon Bleu has made her a better chef. She is magnifique! We highly recommend 10 Scotts to friends visiting Singapore! Good job chef!
3
No special highlight good worth mention; food not labeled; oyster and icecrean D are kept in the fridge which is not obvious. Worst was the cook counter. U will not know what's cooking until u see ask or see ppl eatingService not too bad and a lot of tea varieties
5
A surprising place and a great value. Stop in at 6pm and wine is 50% off! A really great value in Singapore. Also try their buffet... free pour wine and a good little buffet for SG$75.00

Every time I come to Singapore I always make time in my trip for afternoon Tea at Scott's. Having looked up and tried many other Singapore venues I have always ended up back here. The food was nice, the seating comfortable and relaxing. And the price reasonable. However on my return this trip I can only say how disappointed I was in what seems to have been a reduced offering. The choice of foods was dramatically reduced and the service was sadly lacking. I can only think that they had several last minute sick staff. After being seated and given tea we were left. The champagne failed to arrive and trying to get someone's attention was hopeless. The plates served with the sandwiches were not collected and eventually I had to go and get someone. Fish and scones don't go together and new tableware was a must. Getting the bill ended up no quicker and all in all very disappointing. After many happy years I think I will try somewhere new next visit.
4
Came during late afternoon on a weekday (3-5pm) and to my surprise, it was not so crowded. Had the wonderful Afternoon Tea here which included access to the semi-buffet. They will then place a stand at the table that has delicious crabcakes, scones and etcs. At the buffet, they even offered Oysters which was delightful. Your staff, Venessa was also very welcoming and had an eye to detail. Overall my experience here is wonderful and I will definitely be back here to visit.
4
Comfortable seating, cosy atmosphere, excellent service, happy hour from 6-9pm, what can go wrong? Came here on my last evening after a long week. Enjoyed some excellent champagne and took the time to unwind in a very comfortable atmosphere. I didn't eat but the options looked excellent
5
Great location for either (1) a buffet bite or (2) afternoon tea, with friends and/or family. It also shares the space with Grand Hyatt business lounge, giving you free wifi access
4
The place is dimly-lit which gives it a cozy and warm feeling. Savoury dishes are served and you can re-order your favourite ones after trying out all the items on the 3-tier tray. Desserts are placed on the counter and certain items are kept in the fridge behind. Service is warm and friendly
4
10 Scotts has a nice cozy homy atmosphere the moment you walk into the lounge. We had the light buffer dinner package which included salad, fresh oysters, cold cuts, cheese and on-the-spot warm main course. They also provided a wonderful tray of snacks items, the crab ball is wonderful, definitely will fill you up. This is the place for having a relaxing intimate conversation with loved one or a bunch of friends. They also serves alcohols. It's perfect to wind down an evening
4
Modern, relaxed setting, with light warm colours; reminds a bit on Scandinavian style (light wooden tones dominate). From the "Veranda" you have a view to an inner court with an artificial yet nice waterfall. I come regularly with my wife on weekend evenings, as a starting point for our night-outs. The small bites are tasty and tappas-/smoergaasbord-/brotzeit- style, served with bread. I love the bread, because it tastes like bread from home (Germany) to me. (A treat not easy to come by in Singapore, where too-soft American-style bread dominantes.) Service is always friendly, helpful and attentive. The chef makes his tour from time to time and stops by for a chat. Relaxed, not formal atmosphere
3
Its a great space for high tea. We sat at a table with sofas and a view of the waterfall garden place. The other room that looked like a study full of books was pretty cool too.It's not a large buffet. You get a 3 tiered tray (refilable) with curry puffs, prawn filled buns, crab cakes (really liked those), scones (pretty average), macarons (NO to the rose flavoured one and the pistachio one was just very green). The buffet table had har gow (not bad), selection of sushi (ok), chicken cooked on the spot in some sauce (a bit meh), selection of cold meats and cheeses (they looked good but I passed, my friend thought it was good). In the fridge were oysters (not impressed, waterlogged)
4
This is our second visit for the family. Love the buffet options and the high tea which can be replenished if you wish for no extra cost. The high tea has a mix of traditional and local treats which we enjoy. Great price and value for money.
4
Lounge type room like you are sitting in your living room.They allow you to conduct your meetings in peace
4
We came here for an early dinner on a Sunday night recently and opted for the buffet at $45++. This is pretty good value considering that there's some decent food available, including oysters and a good sel croon of cheeses. Only real downside for us was that they ran out of icecream
4
Nice location at the back of the Hyatt lobby, perfect for a quite chat or a business meeting. Great service, comfortable surroundings and calm
4
Came here for their Sunday High-Tea. Staff are friendly and prompt to bring us to our table. High-Tea consist of the tray (which they will bring out to you) and their buffet selection (love their ice cream, which is shaped like an egg)
5
A quite place, very business like, good food and nice ambience. Escape within the hotel. And then you can wink at the waterfall..
4
The food is definitely of the Asian country. What I ate was good. The largest variety of fruit juices I have seen. The staff are nice and the restaurant is clean
5
Lovely attentive staff, beautiful comfortable lounge seating, delicious buffet high tea with quality french champagne. Two hours of yummy delights! Child friendly atmosphere. We will return
5
We just called in for a drink, before going out to find dinner - and stayed all evening. First up was the enticing discovery that it was happy hour. Perrier Jouet, Cloudy Bay and lychee/champagne cocktails were sampled. Wow. Then we spotted the casual buffet supper. There were oysters, cold meats, salad, a chef cooking little steaks. We stayed, and once we had eaten our fill, were brought a Chinese pagoda holding dumplings, sushi and little fish cakes. No pudding, then, and a bill that would have brought tears of joy to the eyes of Scrooge himself
4
We had the Wine Buffet here on two occasions and enjoyed it very much .The menu is not a buffet which is miles long -- but it is more than adequate, with a high quality selection including sweets and savouries, cheese, and fruits and a free flow of wine, juice and tea/ coffee. Wait staff are very polite and attentive.The lounge and dining style seating is very pleasant and there is also a business area for reading, checking emails and having a quiet business discussion.All in all it was a pleasant evening -- at a good price
5
I was a guest at the hotel, and after long day of sightseeing in Singapore, 10 Scotts was a great place to unwind! They're drinks are to die for, and their large variety of snacks were exciting and delicious!10 Scotts has a lounge/business center area, where you can read a book, check emails, or even make phone calls and get some work done. They have various seating areas depending on your mood. Excellent experience
5
Having heard many rave reviews of this place, we decided to give it a try on the 4th day of Chinese New Year even though we are High Tea newbies.First thing that we noticed is the attentiveness of the staff, all the way from making a reservation, to seating us, to patiently explaining the different kinds of teas to us. We were thrilled to discover that the High Tea is replenishable with selected items being available from the buffet counter (cheese, fruits, sushi, chinese new year crackers, sauteed beans, popiah etc). The tea we chose from the menu is replenishable as well.Another plus point we enjoyed was the seating area. Towards the end of the high tea session, servers placed candles on our table creating a soft, soothing effect which is very good for relaxing.One thing that we noticed was the high tea edition came with a small plate of yu sheng given that it was chinese new year season. We had great fun having another round of lo hei!It was such a cosy experience that we would definitely come back here again. Minor downside is that the price for high tea per pax is abit steep
5
They have Wine Buffet in the evening that serving ends at 10pm but you can still continue to sit around.It's my second visit here... the wine is free flow and there's plenty of food. So you won't have to drink empty stomach. There's a cheese section, fridge for oysters and ice cream... cooked food section and desserts. In addition, they will serve a tray for every 2 pax.1 point to note is that the food is always changing. What you had during your first visit may not be available for your next visit. But that should be the way.... and I like it...After a stressed week of work... it's a good place to relax and catch up with your friends. And they are very generous with the serving of wine. There's also juices, tea and coffee.
2
So we booked after seeing the Ironlady review.However our reality was miniture scones, no sandwiches or sweets on the tray just 3 tiny scones and a crab cake and a cuffy puff. As someone who has tried many afternoon teas this IS NOT afternoon tea. This is a lunch buffet.On the plus side, large tea selection and a lovely large sofa area to sit in
4
Was there for Hi-tea with a group of colleagues on 21st Nov. As we are there as a group, we are given a room which has very cosy sofas. The quality of food is very good and there is a wide selection of tea from the menu. Service is good and prompt
4
Good place to have a small bite or a tea when you are in Orchard. Probably the smallest food outlet in Hyatt. feels like being in a cozy library. Great service and good location
4
For full review & photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/09/luxurious-weekend-afternoon-tea-at-10.htmlThe service here was quite good but not warm... Plates were cleared regularly, food and beverages were served promptly. Was quite disappointed to see they do not serve tea in a nice teapot at this classy place like other hotels did..The crab cake was divine from the 2 -tier stand! Desserts were good including the tiramisu, except lacked the alcohol "punch"..There're 3 things that need to be improved here:1) The staff should check with the guests if this is their first visit to the high tea. If this is their first visit, the staff should make an effort to introduce the buffet counter especially the hidden chiller behind the cheese & ham counter - not all guests will notice that chiller and guests wouldn't know that they can actually walk inside the counter to open the chiller themselves unless they ask the staff, otherwise guests will miss the ice-cream from the chiller. And they should introduce the fried egg dessert as well since it was not shown at the counter with any tag..2) They should put up labels at the buffet counter so that we know what we were eating and save the hassle to check with the staff..3) Quality of food and dessert were quite good. But the prices here are on the high side so we find that the items on the 2-tier stand were too ordinary, nothing special. We hope to see more creative new items
5
This is the place! We had been here a few times previously before this place was renovated. Nice comfortable seating and Sebastian the manager was fantastic and so was our indian waiter. The service was exemplary. Thoroughly enjoyed the buffet with free-flow beers or wine and very reasonably priced at $68 ++. The wife had her favourite Singapore Slings in here reckons they are the best in town.... who was i to disagree after she had a couple!!Thanks Sebastian see you again in the near future.

On Wed 2 Jul 2014, two of my Mommy friends and I decided to have high tea at 10 SCOTTS with our 3 girls, aged 4-6. Prior to the day, I had made a booking & informed the Restaurant that there will be 3 kids aged 4-6 in our party. My reservation was accepted. On the day itself, us Mommies & our girls were having a good time chatting & playing together.Towards the end of our happy tea at around 5pm, a Caucasian man of unknown origin, who came in after us to seat at a nearby table, on his way out of the Restaurant, walked up to our table & rudely told us that our kids moved too much, talked too much and we had zero control over our kids. He also said that we were extremely rude for not controlling our kids & letting them walk “everywhere” (meaning in front of him). He then said his kids were ALWAYS perfectly seated in a Restaurant & NEVER walked around. Throughout this nasty outpouring, the Restaurant Manager was standing silently behind this extremely rude diner who went on non-stop negatively. Shortly after this nasty outpouring, the Restaurant Manager came to us to ask us to “do him a favour” and ask our kids to seat. We ended our lovely tea on a crashing low.(1) At point of reservation the Restaurant did not inform me that they had a no kids policy OR the kids needed to be of a certain age OR required the kids to behave in a “certain way” before we could dine there; (2) Throughout our entire 2 hour tea, prior to the nasty outpouring of this diner, neither the Restaurant Manager nor any of the staff came up to us to request our kids to stay seated or keep silent; (3) For a hotel that boasts to promote “quality family bonding time at our City Hotel in Singapore” & even offers baby-sitting service on their website, our experience has proven to be contrary. To clarify, our kids did not go up to disrupt the other diners at their tables, nor break any lamps (or other furniture), utensils or buffet setup (carving or bread stations etc) nor treat the Restaurant staff rudely or poorly. At some point during our tea, us Mommies & ad hoc other diners even chatted louder than our kids!In view of this negative experience, perhaps it is time for the Hotel to rethink their dining policy at 10 Scotts or retrain their staff to manage a more family accepted environment? It would have been good if the Restaurant Manager could have stepped up to explain to the unpleasant diner that the Restaurant accepted young children dining there. For us, we will not be dining there again nor recommend the Hotel to any of our friends, especially if they are travelling with children
5
Always a great place to unwind after a wonderful day of shopping or just to relax over a nice drop of single malt with the family and friends. Will definitely be back soon for a visit
5
I love the ambiance of 10 Scotts and the cozy sofas and tables for informal meetings. We had a couple of meetings there with snacks and drinks. The service is lovely and the scones were fabulous
5
Cozy, elegant, classy, superb design, comfort ... are all words to describe 10 Scotts. Your luxury living room away from home. A must
4
Wine selection is good - no need to go for a special bottle as the house wines are excellent. Good value during happy hour (until 10pm !!). Try the pate with sourdough bread
4
The dimly-lit interior was spacious and exquisitely-furnished in rich, refined tones and sleek, classic English furniture. It was comfort at first sight, without being too ostentatious or intimidating in its elegance. The service staff were all pleasant and friendly.The High Tea concept here is rather interesting - consisting of a short buffet counter and also a two-tiered tray of savoury goodies served to us shortly upon being seated. The buffet counter showcases an array of cakes and other delectable desserts.Now, this was my starter. The Chocolate Tart was very yummy - soft chocolate crust with hints of crunchiness filled with rich but not-too-sweet ganache - the blackberries atop were like icing on the cake for me. I also enjoyed the Fruit Tart - crunchy crust with a buttery center topped with delicious fruits. Right smack in the middle is the Berries and Fig Brownie - the first bite was a rich wonderment and the last bite left one craving for me - but then I always love combination of chocolate with fruits combination.The Two-Tiered Tray of savoury delicacies was being served. The Beef Pastrami (that one that is rolled up) - is made up of a nice grainy "crepe" type dough sheet with a sheet of tender beef rolled into it - overall taste was rather flavorful. The Quiche was pretty normal, but I kind of liked its light soft crust stuffed with fragrant baked cheese.I liked the Prawn and Quail Egg Salad - too bad they only served one small dish for two to share. I loved the succulent freshness of the prawn and I love quail eggs, so needless to say, this item topped my list for today.Next on the list, Crab Cake - a very sumptuous pastry with crispy outer skin and a womb bursting wtih real, sweet crab meat. I read that this was one of the better items for the high tea, and it sure met expectations. Sinful and fattening, yes, but these are the main traits of very scrumptious food items, no? My tastebuds agree!Now we have very freshly-baked scones that were so good they nearly melted in my mouth. We even skipped the jams and creams served with these crumbly pastries and savoured its lightly saccharine flavor instead.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/high-tea-at-10-scotts-grand-hyatt-hotel.htm

Was invited for a business meeting at 10 Scotts one of the weekday. As I was early, I walked in but no staff attended or should I say I hardly see any staffs in there. The place was quite packed for a weekday and I decided to wait outside instead. After a short while, my business friend arrived and we went into the restaurant. Again no one attended to us but we finally approached a staff who came out of the kitchen serving food to a table. Was ushered to a big table though was only 2 of us but no complaints of course.We had the hi-tea buffet. They served us a tray of assorted pastries and there was a small table of buffet spread mostly cakes. The only good thing is drinks & food are free flow. Nothing great about the food except for the ice-cream egg which was quite interesting. In summary, nice place to chill but dont expect much from the hi-tea spread and there are definitely not enough staffs

After we placed our drink orders it did seem to take a while but worth waiting for when they arrived. Otherwise great atmosphere.

Total class setting. Perfect for a business meeting or just unwinding at the end of the day. The wine list is extensive and one of the best I've ever experienced when it comes to wines served by the glass.

This is a beautiful bar / lounge within the Grand Hyatt with lots of little "rooms", gorgeously decorated. There's a deck at the back overlooking the waterfalls but also lots of comfy chairs /couches and a little "library" area as well. I found everything at the Grand Hyatt quite expensive but we happened to drop by 10 Scotts during Happy Hour so was pleasantly surprised by our bill

It's like an oasis in the busy orchard road. The lounge is calm and quiet with a very relaxing interior. We had latte and tea just to give a rest after a day of shopping at orchard. Our drinks arrived quickly and the manager was attentive asking if we would like some snacks so we ordered some small bites . Will certainly come back again as this is now our favorite relax spot along orchard road

It is sad that a bad review has to be written, complements to the chef, the food was wonderful, but having a really rude floor manager made it an extremely unpleasant experience and let a very bad taste. 7 of us went for tea on Friday 8 November 2013, it cost us more than $50 per head for tea and finger food - but saying that, we were happy to pay the price as it was good quality. At about 5.30, the manager came and very rudely, basically told us to get out. We were rather stunned, but patiently and nicely asked if we could wait for another hour for a colleague to arrive, she was suppose to join us, but got caught in the baby clinic; she wanted to show us her newborn cutie. We asked if if we could wait for half an hour as she was on her way, we got rejected, so we asked nicely again if we could move to another table. She eyed us really coldly (she looked at us like we were beggers, it was amazing the contempt!) then proceeded to tell us that each and every single table was booked and taken and that we had to go, in fact half an hour ago. She was just so shockingly rude and arrogant. I had never felt so slighted before, we had paid slightly more than S$350.00 for tea and finger food for 7. What made it worse was the fact she had lied! We quietly vacated the place, stood in the foyer for our friend to turn up. We then stood in the foyer which overlooked the restaurant we had left. When we finally left at about 7pm, we noticed that during all that time, at least 50% of the restaurant tables was empty, the room which the manager kicked us and another group out of, was left empty all along. In my 30 years of travelling and staying in hotels, I have never been treated so rudely and inappropriately, and to be kicked out of a restaurant that was not half full was shocking. It is very embarrassing for Hyatt to have an employee like that, when one goes to a 5-star hotel like Hyatt, one expects to pay a certain price, but one accepts it because one expects a minimum standard of service. This was most unacceptable and I intend to follow this up with a complaint letter to the management of Hyatt, Singapore. What a rude and horrible manager

10 Scotts is definately a comfortable place, a great living room athmosphere. Great for a stop in between the busy roads of Sing. The service is friendly, yet not the fastest and elegant. I had issues with the Wifi setup (apart of a very pricy charge) and the service staff was very helpful with it. Would expect some higher quality nibbles for such venue.Overall a nice plac

As all of share and experience many Hyatt hotels, it is so great to encounter the same feedbacks about the Grand Hyatt Singapore. Although Previously wrote, I would like to specifically identify one department in Grand Hyatt Singapore to congratulate the F&B team and truly salute them. 10 Scotts. The Most Recent additions to the Grand Hyatt Singapore F&B destinations. It has beautiful concept, with Business center, lounge, bar and salon atmosphere, it is comfortable and yet complete solutions to business meetings or friendly encounters.

A nice quite place to enjoy afternoon tea with friends and family. The scones here are served with kaya jam on top of the usual cream and fruit jam. They have a good range of tea for selection. Quality of the teas are good. They serve a tray western and local snacks like sandwich, rolls, curry puff and popiah. There is also a buffet style layout which serves cakes, tarts, sushi, soup, fruits, cheese and ice cream.

Enjoyed a lovely afternoon tea buffet at 10 Scotts. They are reputed to be one of the best afternoon teas in Singapore. The tea came with a tiered set of savoury items with local and international items such as crispy flaky curry puffs, pruscuitto mini buns, salmon crustini etc all refillable. the tea included a wide selection of tea tems and desserts at the buffet table including buttery scones and mini quiche, cheese platter, pretty desserts. every item is lovingly displayed and oh so yummy. Free flow of coffee, juices and specialty teas. The afternoon tea buffet is from 12 - 5pm with 2 seatings at $43 per person; or order off their ala carte menu. 10 Scotts is done in a lounge style which makes it a very relaxing place to enjoy a lovely intimate afternoon. There were also pockets of areas where business meetings were taking place and a board room that can be booked for more formal discussions

Thsi is a large restaurant, carefully subdivided into areas for working, relaxing, eating and informal meetings. Well staffed, so help is just around the corner. Excellent light meals, and the cook can of course provide food not on the menu. Sumptuous sofaÂ´s. Good place to relax

Me and my colleague sat in 10 Scotts for work and after business meeting. The white wine was wonderful, though I am not a connoisseur. We ordered a brieu cheese on both days and it was excellent. Portion was a little small though

Nice den-like setting with nooks and discrete seating areas. Tasty almonds as happy-hour snack goes well with half-price ($7 SNG) Tiger beers for happy-hour.

Great food with great ambience. Their mushroom risotto is awesome so is their pumpkin soup! Quite a decent selection of cakes. Not overwhelming like usual buffets. Highly recommended for cosy gatherings. Free flow of any tea/coffee/fruit juice from the menu.

Nice mall with everything in it, from high end stores like Hermes and a grocery at the basement. One stop mall that is next door tp the Grand Hyatt.

I liked this relaxed, quite lounging area for a peaceful drink with family or friends. Staff were discreet but poilite, and we felt very relaxed and at home here.

Nice and relaxing week day afternoon tea, nice selection of local and western delights. Good offering of food variety. Coffee, tea and fresh juices are on a free flow basis, they also have a champagne high tea offer. Service staff very friendly and well trained, we where there at 12pm and we had it very quite which was nice considering the busy city area you are in. The renovated lounge offers cosy seats and a relaxed ambiance. definitely good value for money considering the price of $38++ per perso

Great place for tea. Good selection. Can be a bit busy at that time. The place can be quiet in evenings, depending on when you are there in evening, which is what I love the place for - after dinner drinks or quick bite with drinks. Average selection for drinks and wine. Service staff was attentive and always friendly

An Asian infused spread of afternoon tea. Good offering of food variety. The second (or more) serving of tea and coffee can be further requested and you are able to opt for a different choice from the first. Service staff are well trained and reached promptly to situations. Setting and seats were cosy and relax. Ideal for a gathering and chats.

Whenever I'm looking for a place to spend a slow afternoon, 10 Scotts would usually be top of mind. The spread is not huge by any standard. But the quality is really good. And the ice cream is usually served in very pretty presentations. There's also free flow of gourmet coffees, teas, juices, etc. So can't complain. Can't show you any photos though as I was stopped from taking photos due to "copyright issues", according to the manager/supervisor. Strange in this day and age..

the range of food is brilliant and its so fresh and succulent that i could eat there everyday if it wasnt quite so pricey. but for a trip and a getaway this is the restaurant in singapore you must eat at if you want the total experienc
