Beef was of good quality. Chicken was also of good quality. Food was expensive though. Rice itself was already 4 dollars and vegetables for 9 dollars.

This is a great family and friends place to have drinks and beef cuts. Harami is so delicious. Definitely worth price and it is priced pretty affordable.

Affordable Japanese BBQ, quality meat
The charcoal burner placed in table can be quite uncomfortable

Ordered a medium range set - sooo good the meat was excellent quality and well seasoned.
Would definitely recommend it for fans of yakiniku.

Charcoal grilled yakiniku in front of Amara Hotel. Japanese wagyu beef. Appetizer , Kimuchi was excellent, beef was great but you have to ask which part is tender so that they will recommend. Assorted beef was good for money but we found that some of beef part e.g beef neck was too tough to eat. I guess that’s because of the part. So suggest to order by individual. The restaurant isn’t for the romantic dinner for couple but if you happened to be around the area, try this place. You can’t find the place like here in other country. Cheap and good. They have set dinner like curry rice also available around 10 USD. Also cheap. They don’t charge service fee of 10% as of today. Truly recommend the plac

One of the best yakiniku meals I've had. And this wasn't in Japan, but in Yakiniku Oh in Singapore. Most ingredients and condiments come from Japan for that authentic taste of various dishes prepared by the Japanese chef. The beef cuts are awesome. Quality meat from how it looks raw to how it tastes after grilling. I recommend tasting the meat with different sauces and condiments until you find your perfect match. My top 3 choices are soy sauce with wasabi, Dijon mustard and roasted sesame seed with rock salt. The accompanying veggies are also worth mentioning. Blanched green leafy, bean sprouts and cabbage topped with Japanese dressing. Good balance to the strong meat and sauce tastes. The grilled meats are best enjoyed with ice cold beer or a bottle of Italian or South African red. Be prepared to spend though. Because quality comes with a price.

We decided to try this as we saw it in a magazine ad. But we regret. 1. When making a reservation, the man said that the restaurant was 'full house'. But our 2h dinner showed only about 3-4 tables filled at any one time and the rest of the restaurant empty.2. Food was pricey and not all costs were upfront. $10 extra for having a charcoal stove? We had 2 and that was already an additional $20. Plus we had to pay extra for each dish as it was dinner.3. Beef was marinated well but in such large chunks. Plus it was very tough so couldn't chew the beef properly and swallowing it was quite an ordeal. 4. Ambience was not there. At all.Food overall was mediocre, and having to pay so much extra like $2 for a glass of water and $4 for a bowl of rice just made the meal very pricey and we felt it was not justified

We were excited to try out this place, as the outlet in Telok Ayer seems to be so popular and the reviews were all good. The first impression I got when I entered the place was "where's the air con?!" All the tables have a charcoal barbecue grill set on top, making the place very hot and stuffy, and the smoke extractors above each grill seemed not to be sucking air at all. Throughout our time spent there, I was constantly breathing in the smoke from the neighboring table. It did kind of give an old established yakiniku restaurant feel, as the tables, the menus and everything we touched was greasy (but don't be fooled, this place just opened recently...)The menu offered quite a variety, so we didn't loose hope yet. The staff was very friendly and helpful with getting us decided on what to order. We decided to get the platter with 4 types of rare meat cuts and the jo-tan (premium tongue), with a salad and namuru on the side. The meat was ok.....the tongue didn't taste premium, actually more like normal tongue in other places. I guess we expected something better based on what we have read in the magazines and reviews, which is why we were probably quite disappointed. This place will be good if you are just looking for a basic reasonably priced yakiniku meal, but not if you want something really good. And also take note that they charge 5% when you pay with a credit card.
