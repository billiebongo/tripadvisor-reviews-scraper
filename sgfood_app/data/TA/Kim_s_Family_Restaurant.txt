Review by Dr Sim. Good Korean Food. Owner is Korean. Sometimes a bit salty. Generally good. Service is average. Good for Tourists or Koreans to try. Ambience is acceptable. Regards Dr Sim.

Wanted authentic Korean food, found this cosy place at one corner. The side dishes is plentiful. A nice place for family dinner.

Daeji Bulgogi 돼지불고기 / Barbecued Pork ($25++)Looks crazy spicy but it wasn't at all-- in fact, more sweet-salty than anything else. Not a fan of this as the meat was rather tough though thinly sliced; maybe I'll try the Beef Bulgogi next time & see if that makes a difference.Mandu Jeongol 만두전골 / Korean Dumpling Stew ($35++)Ah yes, a soupy dish that isn't fiery spicy nor feels full of MSG. This clear broth was very comforting especially after we got caught in the rain. I wish there were more soup, but this is just me being greedy. Dumplings become soft after a while so be sure to eat them quickly!Kimchi Jeon 전김치 / Kimchi Pancake ($14++)Kim's kimchi pancake is always on point-- which is great because sadly, the kimchi side dish was sub-par. This pancake was crispy & delightful with or without dipping it into the accompanying sauce. Great for sharing. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats only Service is generally pretty lousy  Water not chargeable Wet towel not chargeable Rice is $2++/bowl 12 different side dishes, refillable until 21:30hr

Our family has Korean food in the UK from Korean-run proprietors on average at least twice a month, so we are fairly well acquainted with the cuisine. In my view, Kim's Family Restaurant is fairly decent in terms of authenticity. The Kimchee and other starters were plentiful and varied, many more than we have experienced elsewhere. Our large group had a varied mix of items from the menu, from Pajeon (pancake), to meat stews and BBQs, plain soup to spicy tofu chige -- all average to above average fare.However, the service leaves something to be desired. The waitering staff and cashiers all seemed to have a look about them, as if they had lemons all day for food. Not a smile or event a hint of a friendly disposition. For that, our overall dining experience was mediocre

One of my go to familiar Korean places. Price range is average like most korean food. Parking can be an issue as there are limited lots along the road where the restaurant is located. But there is a bigger parking area within walking distance. Nearest MRT would be Beauty World- exit B- blue line (DT5)Tried the the bibimbap and beef Bulgogi. This place has got to be one of the very rare few places that give you 12 side dishes. Each with its own flavour, refillable! You can eat the side dishes and be very full. Recommend calling for reservations first. especially on weekends. Go at non meal times if you prefer a nice not too noisy ambience.Try it

Went to the Telok Ayer branch, alighted from Telok Ayer mrt stop on the downtown line, you need to walk about ten minutes, past the temple and a couple of crossings to No. 177 at the corner of the street. Quiet early at 7pm on a Saturday night. Did not order the barbecue as we are mainly vegetarian, went for the fried glass noodles with vegetables (mainly onions, capsicum, mushrooms), very nicely fried, fragrant and not too heavily seasoned $14, and the chive pancake $15 which was a bit bland (the kimchi pancake on the menu might have been a better choice) but dipping it in the sauce provided and the kimchi in the side dishes (10, and most delicious esp the fried soyabean slices...ikan bilis and spinach bit salty) was fine. Reminded us of the bibimbap restaurant in Jeonju with countless banchan !So, vegans and vegetarians can have a good meal here too. Other a la carte dishes like spicy soup and ginseng chicken soup looked good too.Simple basic decor but quite cosy on a rainy night, worth re-visiting

My first impression,like in Korea.Most of it's customer are korean.Many choice to choose and their bbq item are reasonable in term of price and quality.All come with 12 side dishes and refillable.But during peak period,you expect to wait for half hour.And parking along the road there is quite a problem.There's a big public carpark is about 100m away.Service is abit slow ,understandable

Tuck at a small lane away from the main road is this Korean family restaurant that serves authentic Korean food. One of my favourite no frills place when my wife and I needed some wholesome kimchi soup. Price is reasonable and the serving generous. Worthwhile going back again and again

Reservations highly recommended because even on weekday evenings, it can get rather crowded. Just make sure everyone is here before you can get seated esp when its full house. Nearest MRT to alight to get to Kim's will be Beauty World (Take exit B). We were blown away by the amount of side dishes presented to us before our main courses were served.. not only the variety is a lot but the taste of each side dishes was superb (and refillable). We ordered the beef with glass noodles, octopus soup.. army stew, kimchi pancake and pork belly with kimchi to be shared among 4 girls. It was a delicious, hearty and enjoyable meal at a reasonable price. The service was normal, nothing fantastic or terrible to write about, just average. But the overall ambience and food was what we came for and it was good. Will be back

This place feels like a real korean eatery, with a nice atmosphere, unlike the normal hype in sg where they try to "spruce it up" with loud K-pop music and such. They serve 12x awesome and tasty side dishes which is enough to fill you up before your meal! Only thing is that they keep trying to take the menu away even when we just wanted to hold on to one to look at what else they have to offer after we had ordered our dishes

Kim's Family Restaurant have been around for the longest time in Bukit Timah and i have visited this restaurant at least once a year whenever i am in Singapore. Needless to say, whatever you look in a Korean meal is available here.

If your pal's didn't tell you about this place! You will be missing out on really home style Korean cooking. It's so for the family that even the walls of the place are covered with family 'friendly' stuff!! Come see for yourself!

The restaurant looked very rustic and homely as could be deduced from the restaurant name. Pricing also looked very reasonable. We tried the tteokbokki which was the best I had in Singapore so far, although the rice cakes could have been cooked longer in the sauce. The pajeon and bulgogi hot plate were good too. Would come back again to try their BBQ meats and other dishes

The decor is still the same since our last visit but few things has changed now.The menu is now presented in a more classy new binded book, with glossy nice food pictures.And I believed the prices has increased! We have been here few times last year & now our bill is higher even though we ordered 1 item less for 5 adults. We usually order few favourites & noticed the higher prices now.Another good change is that it is very convenient to come here now, regardless of where one comes from. The Downtown Line 2 MRT started operation about 2 weeks ago. Just stop at Beauty World MRT station & exit at Chun Tin Road. Only 2 mins walk to Kim's.Although prices are higher now, it is still worth coming for the good food. At least for now

We had a reservation but the restaurant was full when we came. The place is not very big. We were ushered to another premise about 2-3 shops away on the same stretch. Apparently this was an additional area. We passed by this 'restaurant' earlier & thought it was another restaurant. Decor is more basic here, not as nice as main one but it is fine.We ordered Ginseng chicken soup, Pancake , Bulgogi beef with bean paste soup & Spicy beef soup. A wide range of refillable nice side dishes were served.Overall the food is quite good. One of the best we have tried. The portion is big/generous, prices reasonable & certainly offers very good value.We were the only ones at this extended place & there was only 1 service staff. Her service was good. She was pretty attentive. Not sure if it will be the same if the place is full.Location may be a little inconvenient, depending on where you come from. But once the nearby Beauty World MRT starts operation in December, coming here will be a breeze. Its only a few minutes walk from MRT station.If you want reasonably priced, good value & authentic good Korean food; don't miss this place

My wife and I had a quick lunch on a weekday. This is a korean family restaurant that has had a long following due to its fair pricing and it's authentic cuisine. Most meals come with up to ten complimentary dishes of kimchi, bean sprouts, pickles and even a whole fish.It s run by a korean family and they've always kept its food consistent and great tasting.They offer Korean BBQ, Korean Ginseng Chicken and the house specialty, Korean Pancake.We ordered;•Beef Bulgogi•Served on a hot plate, great taste but the sliced beef should be more consistent in its thickness.•Spicy Kimchi Soup•Fantastic! It's a large bowl of spicy hot yummy soup, so sharing is good. Flavors were complex yet great for a nice rainy day

There were two Korean restaurants along the stretch of shophouses. My friends and I chose this restaurant because we were attracted by the good price of the bulogi sets free flow of side dishes.When we entered the restaurant, we were 'welcomed' by a Korean looking staff. He looked very tired. Fortunately, he had to attend to a phone call and another staff took over to take our order.We ordered a beef bulogi set, a chicken bulogi set and a bowl of ramen. The servings of the food were very generous. I think for those small eaters, two persons can just order a set of bulogi and maybe an additional bowl of rice. I like the chicken bulogi very much. The seasoning was just right. I felt that the beef was too tough. What we loved most was the free flow of tasty side dishes. When we went to the restaurant for our lunch, it was quite empty. We were there for about 2 hours and saw less than 10 customers, maybe because it was a weekday. I think the korean-looking staff might have find that too depressing as we could hear him sighing at the counter.Other than the korean looking staff, the other service staff were very polite and attentive. With the nice value for money food and pleasant dining environment, we would definitely love to go back again. Hopefully the demoralised staff would become more enthusiastic by then

Hi Korean food lovers,This place is my favourite Korean restaurant! The ginseng chicken soup is the same I had it in seoul at city hall. Just a bit more expensive when I compare them. But it is good for 2 person potion. The sides dishes is refillable. A good 12 sides dishes served. Worth to eat! The food are cook by a Korean chef. And they have another restaurant at the mall called West Coast mall. Both are good

Well having been to Korea a couple of times and having tried the food in Seoul, I have gone to a couple of places in Singapore to seek out authentic korean food and I must said that Kim's come closest to what you can find in Seoul. The restaurant is run by a Korean chef and his family and they have opened a branch in West Coast Community Centre. My favourites are the side dishes that accompany the main course and depending on the time of the year some of the side dishes differ throughout the year.And a clear winner is their homemade kimchi just like the ones you get in Seoul. If you like korean food this is the place to go to

We've been to this resto sooo many times. It serves a huge array of Korean food, and is owned by a Korean family. There are a lot of Korean restos in Upper Bukit Timah, and we've tried many of them, but this is the best one.We love their barbecued meats, the pork knuckle, the kimchi soup, the rice noodles with black sauce, the spring onion pancake and the octopus with spicy sauce. The place gets busy and is very popular, so better make reservations
