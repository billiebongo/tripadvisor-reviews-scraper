The Minced meat noodle is very good with variety of ingredients.
The price is considered expensive at $4, $5, $6.
It is worth trying. Soup is not as thick and rich as I expect.

This is "D'place" to go for a good old "Ba-Chor Mee" (Minced Pork Meat Noodle).
Very authentic taste with a superb soup that are good. Never had they fail to "wow" me so far.
Highly recommended.

Whenever I am at Toa Payoh, this is my go-to place when I want some Mee Pok. On this visit, I ordered the $4 bowl. I had the dry Mee Pok, which had minced pork, lean pork, bean sprouts. What’s special is the sole fish that they include in each bowl of noodles. They add a nice flavour to the noodles. Do help youself tro the pork lard that’s on the side table in front of the stall. Although it’s of the oily kind, they are really delicious!The noodles were not bad

I come to this stall whenever I have my Minced Meat Noodle Cravings. I often reach the stall around 2pm, when all the lunch crowds have thinned out, so I need not jostle for a car park slot or table.The downside is that my choice of noodles (Mee Kia - Thin round noodles or Mee-Pok - Thin flat noodles) may be out of stock.This was indeed the case when I went there a few days ago. So I ordered what was available (yellow noodles with kway teow) instead. It came with a good dressing of vinegar in the noodles and flat fish. The smallest size you can order is $3. The $4 and $5 version will get you additional abalone slices. On the side table, you can help yourself to the cut chilli and soya sauce. Look out for a covered round aluminium container. Open the cover and you will find the essential 'crispy pork lard' to go along with the noodles. Hear a spoonful over your noodles and the taste will improve two or maybe three fold!With the shortage of manpower these days, they no longer bring the noodles to your table. Instead you will be given a number tag, and they will flash your number on the screen when your order is ready. This means you can wait at your table while still in the 'queue'.Try it

not sure of the address listed here. i thought they had moved to Lor 4 or Lor 5 where Uno Beef House is located. the noodle is shiok! just the right amount of sauce & vinegar. i love it dry with chilli but just as many customers ask for soup as well. portion is a little small, so we end up ordering medium - $4 instead of $
