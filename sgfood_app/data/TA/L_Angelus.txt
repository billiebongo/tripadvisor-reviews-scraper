The restaurant was quiet but is was Tuesday night
Well worth a visit when in Singapore

Place to go if you are very hungry
Go for the set menu at dinner time, terrine was perfect
Good wine list and service
You can eat outside or inside

We had dinner here on 2 of our 4 nights in Singapore. Excellent menu with just enough variety to the fixed menu (5 options for each serving) at an excellent $68 each. Entree options were excellent with a special mention to the goat cheese salad. Yummy.Tuna steaks with sesame seed coating were our favourite main though the second night they were a bit cool.Dessert was fabulous and the bread as it should be in a French restaurant was superb.All up a lovely restaurant and well worth a visit

As we walked along Club street looking for a place to have dinner - we ended up at the porch at L'Angelus - eating a delicious french meal - instead of a nice Chinese dinner - as we had planned to do. They served us a delicious sole meuniere - (not even on the menu...) - - and the wine list was impressive.The guests at the neighbouring table were locals - and admitted they ate at the L'Angelus quite often - as one of their favourite restaurants in Singapore. We understand why...( service very friendly - and a very "french" interior - if that matters..

+ SGD 39 for a three course set lunch incl coffe in the CBD is a good, competitive offer. + restaurant is decorated bistro-style in a renovated shop house.+ service is friendly and attentive- cold cut starter plate: good variety, but why do I need to visit a restaurant to just get sliced meat without any salad, or pate or something special?- steak: very strange texture, felt a bit like soaked in meat softener, somehow real beef texture missing- potatoes: not cooked enough- crème brule: felt like being "sitting" in the fridge for a very long time- only two tables busy ...would I go again? NOPE, simply too much choice around the corne

First of all, the food was good but the service from the female petite manager was really below average. This is my first time having a meal in a local restaurant that i felt i was actually in a foreigner country. Is kind of disappointing that it happened in our own country and is not surprised that the manager is actually a Singapore citizen herself. She has an attitude problem and the best part is towards her own people
5
Went back to this little French place in Chinatown . They have now a lunch set quite nice for the price .36$. Got a cold cut platter , a nice steak, a creme brûlée and coffee . What else can you expect ? Superb . Great service too .

This restaurant is one with a long history on Club Street. Deservedly so. Good service. Flawless home made pate. An interesting amuse bouche, tasty! And well cooked steaks to order, both cuts explained by the waitress. Service was attentive as we'd come to expect from a previous visit or two. We started on the terrace this time to enjoy the sights of the street. Before mains we asked to move inside because a bar nearby decided to go heavy metal at 7.30pm. Despite the restaurant being near full, this was handled seamlessly. Glad we got to experience the ambience inside. Lovely. A well run, well respected restaurant.

My daughter grew up in Switzerland near the French border and to her, there is nothing better than authentic French food. So to celebrate her graduation last night, out of all the restaurants in Singapore, L'Angelus was her choice. Never disappointing, simply great French food in a lovely fine dining atmosphere. And they now have a $68 three course menu that has a great selection. If we hadn't gone with our favorite menu items in mind we would have been tempted but we stayed with our favorites: duck liver pate, duck liver grilled and the Chicken Fricassee in a morel and truffle sauce (the recipe's on their website) which is to die for. For dessert, my daughter had her favorite hot chocolate cake with their luscious vanilla ice cream. One more thing, I'm on a low-carb diet (no sugar) and found the menu filled with possible options. But just to make sure, my waitress went to the kitchen and came back with a list of the best of all choices. An unbelievably gourmet meal which also didn't derail me off my diet? At L'Angelus, what's not to like
5
We had dinner with 5 people. The food was delicious. Could not fault anything. The foie gras was fantastic. Reasonable prices for the wines considering the import duties charged in Singapore. Only remark is that our waiter needs some more training.The Aperol Spitzer is good, very good. Highly recommend i
4
Very good food for value. Traditional French plates.
The food menu is not taking you too long to read and choose so it is appreciable especially when what ever you take, you will be satisfy by the food.
4
Good french place on Club street, it is an institution, has been here for ages. I liked the meat selection. Great wine also, though they know how to charge.
3
Friday lunch and if this is always on the agenda.
Good French menu and awesome wine list at reasonable prices.
We both ordered steak frites with rib eye. It was good not great for once something was missing.
5
Came to this fantastic restaurant for a friends birthday party, the food was sensational, the service and ambiance was excellent, everyone had a great time, highly recommend this restaurant when in Singapore.
5
Stopped by late one evening without a reservation and, to our surprise, was given a table and served great food. We both had the set dinner in this classic French restaurant. The onion soup was just right - a bit of cheese and crouton in a very nice and very-full-of-onions broth. The tuna tataki with sesame was perfectly done and my wife's cassoulet was just delicious with enough to take some home with us. They offer a wide selection of wines and the wait staff understand how to recommend them. The creme brûlée was perfect as was the service through the meal. It's a bit pricy but that's common for Singapore. If you like classic French food we'd highly recommend L'ANGELUS
5
The food in L'Angelus is absolutely phenomenal. Great restaurant with really good flower decoration from outside view. The service was excellent and the Chinese lady who is serving is the friendliest and most professional i ever seen in any Singaporean restaurant. I ordered as appetizer the Roasted Chavignol Goat Cheese and Salad on Walnut Bread Toasts and it was 'WOW'.As mains , i ordered Marinated Lamb Racks , Ratatouille and Mashed Purple Potatoes and Lamb it melts in the mouth. Really a great chef.So far , this is the best french restaurant i ever been in my life.Dinner 23.3.201

I was there with my wife to celebrate Valentine's Day. The place is wonderful, they pay attention to the detail from decoration in the restaurant and washroom, to the tableware on the table. The waiter and waitress are very friendly and served us very well. We ordered French onion soup, escargot, ribeye steak and Profiterolles glacées au chocolat. The escargot served in individual clay pot with a piece of toasted bread on top and that's my first time eating it this way and it's lovely and tastefully. We shared the French onion soup which is just right for both of us. The Rib eye steak served with layered potato gratin and they tasted wonderful. The serving is big and we were so full after the main course but we don't wish to miss the dessert. They displaced the Profiterolles glacées au chocolat nicely on the plate and we were in heaven. It tasted so good that we want another plate, may be next time because we were so full. We had a wonderful evening and we definitely will visit again.

We went to l’Angelus to celebrate our son’s 20th birthday.I mentioned to a colleague of mine that we would be going there on November 26. He told me that he had been disappointed the last time he went there for dinner and he would be interested in getting my feedback.The starters were ok, 2 x escargots, 1 salad and 1 duck foie gras. Mind you, it is not very complicated. A good oven for the escargots and a good knife for the salad and for the foie gras.As a main course we ordered Chateaubriand, Bar and a Wagyu steak. The meat of the Chateaubriand was ok. We had to wait a few minutes for the gratin dauphinois. Needless to say that the meat was getting cold while waiting. When the gratin arrived, it came as a rectangular kind of a brick, coming straight from the deep freezer. Unfortunately, it did not stay long enough in the micro wave as the middle of it was still very cold.My daughter went for the beef. Again, a disappointment, the meat was chewy but the French fries were good. At least they were not cold and were served together with the meat.My wife took the bar. It could have been any fish as the taste was covered by the sauce. Not impressive at all.We did not take any dessert.One thing that was very disappointing was the service. No smiling faces. The service need to improve a lot, not friendly and not efficient. There were only 4 tables with customers.We had been there many times but last night was our last one
4
Had dinner here with a mix of colleagues and friends while on business trip. Food was very good as well as the wine. Service was good and friendly. The dishes were very large and may be reduced in size. We were not able to have dessert because of the size of starter and main
3
L'Angelus rightly has a great reputation for its excellent French food and is located in the lively Club Street. But our evening was undermined by snail-paced service. We started with the incredible mushroom soup, the fois gras and terrine, all served in a reasonable time. Then we had to wait well over an hour for our main courses. When they arrived, they were excellent: duck, beef and lamb. We complained about the wait and management assured us that this was unusual and because they were short-staffed, and offered us a complimentary drink. One of our party said that they had experienced something similar before, so I would definitely recommend the food but only if you have superhuman patience
3
Ok place, seating outside, noisy with uk football from the bar next door, friendly service, food average really for such a long time established place. Much prefer Les Bouchons just next door. Same owner, just better.
4
We have visited L'Angelus during Singapore residence and visits over several years and have always been pleased with the ambience and quality. Noted on this occasion, on a busy Friday night night in Club Street, that it was very quiet and was surprised how high the prices were for even the house wine - significantly above other local establishments. Quality was still good and we enjoyed our meal
5
I discovered this French bistro invited for business lunch . I was pleasantly surprised . The food is not only excellent but also very well done . Guess the chef must be French or at least trained in France ! Some interesting touch of originality here and there ( a nice variation on " bavette" with a kind of coriander lemon condiment ) but great classics like cassoulet or roasted lamb with an exceptional ratatouille ( I love ratatouille, this one was great ). Dessert are well done and elegant on the plate . Another thing I liked was the wine list , good choice with some rare bottles, mainly Bordeaux old vintages , very decent in price . Speaking of price , they have a 68$ menu , the one I had , quite decent for Singapore if you check the quality . Bravo 
4
Have been dining here regularly for over 5 years. Nice " French" dÃ©cor and atmosphere. Food and menu has improved recently. The Veal chop is huge, and very tasty. Remains traditionally French, as is the wine list. The wine list is on the expensive side. Closer to fine dining prices in a bistro environment. The restaurant manager is friendly and attentive, particularly to " regular" clients
5
Went to this restaurant following advice from hotel concierge . He told me it was one of the oldest French in town, a bit on the expensive side . But I was pleasantly surprised as they have a fantastic menu for a reasonable price ( around 68 $ if I am not wrong). They are celebrating 18 years in Singapore . Well, I had a very good chicken liver terrine , as good as in some high end bistro in Paris and my friend tried the snails who were to die for ! My main was a very good lamb, juicy tender rack perfectly cooked with a very very good ratatouille . My friend had the duck, a farm one, very tasty. Excellent dessert ( I had their hot chocolate cake, it's a very good one !). They gave good wines too and I understood from the manager lady they import most of them so pricing is very decent for Singapore . We got a bottle of a wine from south of France , Les Brunes , a kind of boutique wine that was superb and only 98$. Good value for money all in one . Honestly, I felt like in Paris in a very good bistro . Service is ok. Great place, good value. I recommend 
3
Yet another French style 'bistro'. The interior is nice and "chic" and typically French. They have quite and extensive menu and wine list. The food was good (but very expensive) and well presented. Service is average. Overall I would say its a decent restaurant but over-priced. It seems to be the norm in Singapore that a lot of restaurants that provide average food and service feel the need to over charge in order to somehow give the impression that they better than what they are.
4
I have been dining at this joint for over a decade and for some reason I still find it appealing though the price is on the high side but that's fine. So much for the recent feedbacks posted...one word cynical but then again to each his/her own.My all time favourites..foie gras...escargots...duck confit and their fish dishes. Will definitely be back always..
4
Been a few times and its just as good as the first time I visited. Nice size portions, tasty food, good service, & nice ambiance. Perfect place for a great meal! ! Oysters are always fresh & escargots are divine! Of all the french restaurants I have been to in Singapore, I will say this is my favorite
4
Set up brasserie style, it's a good solid menu of traditional french favorites. Prices are a little steep, but the quality is evident from the moment you arrive. Foie Gras perfectly done, an amazing veal chop and a good solid wine list to choose from. Great cheese selection as well. Happy to recommend.
4
A Singaporean friend assured us this was the best French restaurant in Singapore and after living in France for 30 years I must agree. The foie gras either as pate or pan seared is exceptional, the mains were all good and the molten chocolate cake with ice cream a treat. Particular kudos for the strawberry ice cream dessert. Lovely decor, good service.
4
Quality food comes in generous portions and unpretentious plating. The seared scallop with squid and pumkin soup were excellent; so was the delightful beef steak. The hot chocolate cake was to die for, while the plate of 10 assorted cheeses was delightful.
3
For a French restaurant, nothing could be more insulting than to be told your experience was unsatisfying, but that's exactly how we finished this dinner feeling. Had to leave for airport at 9:30 so wanted a great "last night" meal and cancelled Morton's to go here instead. Wrong move. I'm an Francophile so know my French cuisine very well and whilst the menu is French classics in theory, it's sadly not in practice. As another reviewer noted "not the French flavor".Got there around 6:45 and instead of sitting us at a table and offering a Kir, sent us away with "we don't open until 7:00pm" so we found a bar across the road and duly waited. Bread was great, good start. Pan fried fois gras good, but the product speaks for itself. Onion soup reasonable, not the best, but not the worst, and as my husband makes a great one with home made veal stock, it's unfair to compare. Main course, tartare and onglet (blue) with french fries, that were not really French fries. Too thick. Tartare was OK, a standard tartare and expectations were met, but no "wow" factor. The onglet was off - it tasted and smelt odd. You begin to doubt yourself initially because after all, this is a good restaurant n'est pas? It was red, and looked OK, but there was this distinctive odor and taste. I gave my husband a mouthful, he said straight away, "no, that's not right". It was left. When they asked what was wrong I asked them to ask the Chef what he thought about the steak. They returned and said "that's what a blue steak tastes like". I've been eating my steak blue all my life, even before I lived in France, so I know what it should taste like. I love my food and eat absolutely everything, and could count on one hand food that I rejected. This was one of them.I wasn't offered the choice to order something else at the time, but noted it was not charged on the bill, which was appropriate. We had lava cake and creme caramel, both average. I was told this was run by a Frenchman, but he was nowhere to be seen front of house or in the kitchen on a Friday night. Wait staff were attentive, but Chinese chefs cooking French cuisine is akin to French chefs cooking chinese food. It simply won't taste authentic. Wine list is expensive, a carafe of wine whilst good is $60
2
Really disappointing by our dining experience at l Angelus. Poor food, not the French flavour. The Saint Jacques and calamar as a main was a pure joke, not well cooked, and ridiculously small. 50SGD for this dish is a real joke. No problem to pay more in Singapore but not for this. The creme brulee was just decent. The wine was nice... Will definitely not come again..
5
Simply excellent food, Foie gras terrine and beef steak are a must try. Great wine list too. The service is impeccable, not intrusive and very professional.Located in Club Street, a very lively street at night. Highly recommend for people seeking for other flavours when in Singapor
4
From trying many french restaurants throughout Singapore, there are many places that try to give a french flavor to their atmosphere and menu, but L'Angelus is truly the best for a real brasserie experience -- great foie gras (in several styles), an excellent selection of both entrees and mains, plus a variety of the traditional desserts (with nice new touches). All in all a good experience for a traditional french meal at a high quality but not fine-dining level
4
Out and about with mates on Club Street, we all fancied a taste of France for dinner. With no booking, we were seated easily. Service is a little stand off-ish. The staff appear to lack confidence, though were very congenial. A little tinkering, and this could make the difference of this restaurant going from good to great. In terms of the food, it was really very good. We shared pate and escargot to start. A table of 5 and only 3 pieces of bread and 9 escargot. A little proactivity here could make a huge difference. At the time of ordering, if we were offered 10 escargot for additional cost, we would have opted in. We had to ask for additional bread, also. Despite this, I could not fault the food itself. Delicious. Steak was a popular choice at our table and each were cooked to medium-rare perfection. Of particular note, the Tartare was terrific. Assembled and prepared at the table, it was pure food theatre. Delightful.A good wine cellar in the house, we were pleased with the wines.
4
It used to bother me that L'angelus hardly ever updated their menu; however, over the years I've come to appreciate that sometimes you just want a perfect elegant little bistro like L'Angelus that hardly ever changes. The foie gras is perfect, the confit of duck delicious and the wine list is very accessible. My only complaint is that the fries that come with the confit are a little soggy. Nevertheless, when I want classic relaxing French in a sophisticated setting, this place is always on my short list.
5
Went with friends on two separate occasions, love foie gras so thought to give this French restaurant a try despite previous reviews. Talking to the staff, they had very recently undergone a change in the kitchen. Incoming Chef Reynaldo recommended the presse foie gras to begin with, the balance of sweetness and the savouriness was perfect. For our main, 2 of us had the Chateaubriande steak (portion was filling for 2) which was served with the very tasty potato gratin is a must try, codfish with cream sauce, sea bass was very fresh and tasty. For desert, we had the dark chocolate lava cake and poached pear. Dark chocolate is good, poached pear had a creamy center which is a pleasant surprise. Overall, you will not be disappointed. Ask the friendly staff and manager jasmine for recommendations and they are always willing to help.Regarding the the lack of pictures, we finished the dishes so quickly cause they were so tasty. When we remembered, only dessert was left. Will definitely be back.
5
I haven't been here for years. And what a pleasure to be back. Never mind the restaurant did not upgrade its interior, as that is part of the charm.Excellent service! Seating is comfortable with even a possibility to eat on the veranda or outside on the street (when the road is closed off)Very good choice from a menu which stretches the entire variety of the traditional French kitchen. Portions are generous, which forced me to let go the very good looking choice of cheese
4
I was not joining the business dinner very happily : a French restaurant in Singapore when I dreamed of street food..... But I must recognise it is real and tastes real. Good place to eat real bistro food if you wish so 
3
food is ok, we ordered chateaubriand doneness to ' A point ' as requested by my sister. good!
good selection of wine. Cosy ambience, we like it, unfortunately, service staff are not great.
5
Went there for dinner after being recommended by my good friend who knows that i adore french food.Was recommended by the chef, Reynaldo, his signature foie gras salad, along with seabass and wagyu steak.The salad was very well prepared and well balanced and the mains were delicately prepared. Perhaps this represents being able to "taste passion".Could tell that the food were prepared with passion and skill.Paired it with a red wine recommended by the manager and it complemented the food very well.Recommend this place for a nice dinner with your date or with friends for a quality dinner along with a comfortable and classy atmosphere.Oh one more thing to add, the creme brulee was fantastic as well
3
Heard a lot about that restaurant, so was looking forward to it. Let's set the service aside : the service was good. Friendly waiters and waitresses. The decor was good as well ..nice posters on the wall, high ceilings and good A/C. But the food and the prices were a major let down. 115 Sing dollars for the meal was poor value for escargots / snails and Tartare plus mediocre chateauneuf 2012 .. I was chocked by the wine list and prices...a Cote du Rhone Basic Guigal at 88 Sing is excessive. Simple average burgundies above 110 Sing ..are simply bad value. The snails were swimming in butter sauce - strange recipe - not what you get in France. Average Steak Tartare . All of It ..disappointing
3
Yeap, i do agree with fraser115.I used to like the place but after my last visit, i say: never again!I think the same girl manager served us and yes, she does not accept any criticism!And the best is she called the boss....he is worse than her...no comments
4
A light lunch with a friend on a quiet Monday.What better place in Singapore than on Club Street as it starts to wake from the night before, at that perennial bistro, L'Angelus.The décor is traditionally Parisian bistro.The music is Piaf or some other husky throated Gallic warbler!The service is prompt.The food is delicious - a beautifully cooked salmon in a bag with a glass of Provencal RoseExcellent bistro to wind away a few hours or one short one over great, freshly cooked food
2
No restaurant can afford to rest on its laurels and unfortunately, that is precisely what this one is doing. The restaurant occupies a position in the centre of Club Street that after 7pm at the weekend becomes one of the hippest areas of the city. When we entered this quaint French Bistro style restaurant we left our entire feel good factor on the pavement of Club Street as the restaurant was completely lacking in atmosphere. There was very little energy among the staff and it felt boring. The standard of cooking was mixed; the starters were good however both the Duck Confit and the Sausage Cassoulet were overcooked. I expected a melt-in-the-mouth duck confit with succulent meat encased in a crispy skin instead; I received overcooked dry and chewy duck - dreadful! After waiting fifteen minutes for our plates to be removed, the waitress came to top up our wine glasses and we had to ask for our table to be cleared. We said the food was overcooked but the waitress, whom we discovered was the manager, would not accept any criticism. We asked for the bill and when paying we were saying we were disappointed with both the food and the service. However, the worst service was yet to come as I had to ask the waitress (manager!) to stop clearing the table next to us when my husband was paying the bill and she was still talking to him - absolutely appalling service! The staff appears to have forgotten that they are actually there to serve the customer. Club Street has so much more to offer than this
4
OK, so the staff may be a little formal, but they all speak French and a healthy number of their patrons were French speaking when my wife and I visited. So, give your French a try! Atmosphere was very authentic, but a bit more swish than a typical Parisian bistro and far more room. We had a bit of a hiccup with my wife's entree, when 45 minutes after ordering we were told that it was off the menu. However, the remainder of the meal went very smoothly and they did the right thing (my wife's replacement entree turned out to be complimentary). I had the warm goats cheese for entree, whilst my wife had a pate: both really excellent. My main meal was duck with figs: outstanding. My wife had entrecôte steak: cooked 'a point' as ordered, but quality of beef a little lacking. Superb wine list, with prices upwards of $88 (plus the irritating"++"). Definitely worth another visit
4
We had a brilliant meal here at the beginning of February. We found the setting and atmosphere of the place to be sufficiently French to make us forget we were not in Paris. The food and wines were of a very high quality. The service was also very French, i.e. somewhat stiff and formal (what a shame they're too proud to learn from the Italians!).If you are in Singapore and are looking for a proper "French" restaurant, then look no further than l'Angelus. It is extremely good – but be careful, the bill may be larger than you were expecting
4
Great little place with extensive French wines by the bottle or glass at reasonable prices. Charming rustic decor a la Francaise and simple but delicious menu offering items such as Croque Monsieur, goats cheese tart, Croque Carillon (goats chees and bacon), lovely assortment of cheeses - small or larger plate -, crusty French breads, generous salads with mustard vinaigrette etc. etc to name but a few. There's also a very good rillette and foie gras in offer.French magazines are readily available - they are mostly recent too!Downstairs lounge area is also available for larger groups with a pool table for those interested. One of my favorite spots in this area - just wish the French owner wouldn't look so serious and perhaps give his customers a smile now and then ;-
5
Been many times but not for a few years and it did not disappoint. Walked in and it was very familiar surroundings and I immediately felt relaxed and ready for some classic French fare. Started with foie gras simply prepared but with decadence. Next was a bavette steak full of flavour, topped with shallots and accompanied with very crispy straw fries, yumm. To finish the theatrical crepe suzzette done table side. Wine is typical singapore prices but the range and quality are always there in the L'Angelus group. A great meal, well prepared with great service. Worth a try.
5
I had a wonderfull evening excellent red wine with perfect temperature. Escargots and cote de veau perfect. Service. Very good. I can really recommend this place.
3
Had a wonderful meal at this restaurant however the service was absolutely lousy, and we were often waiting to be served.The waitress never smiled once, simply put the customer last and made no effort to build up a rapport so we did'nt feel welcomed whatsoever. It was clear that she did'nt want to be working there.I found the food to be over-priced however I'm not upto date with the prices within Singapore so be aware of that.There are certainly better restaurants on Club St with staff who actually want you in their restaurant, go elsewhere instead 
4
I read some of the negative reviews and feel compelled to offer a different view. If one is looking for a perfect romantic dinner for two, perhaps this is not the place. However, if you are looking for and old fashioned brasserie with standard french comfort food that can accommodate a group of say 6,8, or 10, then L'Angelus is the perfect alternative. I was there last week with a group of 10 and there were no complaints. Sure, it's a little rough around the edges and the menu hasn't changed in years, but two or three times a year it's the perfect alternative to all the newcomers. I love the place and save it for such occasions.
5
The first time I went here was when my friends arranged my birthday dinner here, it was kind of a surprise, and a very pleasant one. From then ive been here quite often, and it’s a perfect place if your would just want to relax, enjoy your meal have a nice conversation. If your alone, just hop on the bar stool, and the staff is kind enough to give you company, also introduce you to regulars around. The ambiance at L'Angelus is perfect for a large group to talk without having to scream over the table and its even better for a quite romantic dinner for two. The food is delicious, I love their desserts…. (There have been time Ive stopped by just for it)The staff is kind and friendly and they make you feel comfortable, from helping you with suggestions, to short conversations while you’re waiting. I'm definitely coming back more often :
1
While I tried very hard to maintain my virtue, every single aspect of this restaurant was appalling and I could not help but to find myself in negative territory.As this was the first time I had returned to this restaurant in 6 years, perhaps it was naive of me to expect the standard was still upholding.The quality of food, presentation, staff's attention, menu, service standard, everything was absolutely disgusting. I requested my steak to be medium to well-done, and it came out raw in the middle with dripping blood.Plus the meat tasted weird. It wasn't a high quality meat.My shoe string fries looked like a jumbled up wire that didn't resemble anything of a potato, but soaked in greasy oil.The onion soup was disgusting. The french toast on top was already soggy and there was no flavor.The price of lunch wasn't whopping, but if we'd pay $80 a head for LUNCH, we'd at least expect our steak to be done properly as per request.Overall, there were staff hanging around, not particulary doing anything but gawking and glaring at my female client who was Asian in an extremely inappropriate, indecent manner.Entirely embarrassed that I even considered this restaurant to be the venue for my important lunch meeting. Never ever again, will I ever visit this restaurant
5
We were invited to this restaurant by a collegue who lives here. Wether you choose this restaurant or another, this area is vibrant and lively. In the weekends they close off the streets from car traffic and the restaurants expand their premises to include the street as well. A beautiful area neighborhood with two story buildings called shop houses. Our friend said early that the food is among the best but the service can be up and down. On our visit - it was impeccable. When looking for a champagne we were offered to try a glass before ordering a bottle. We ha the sea bass tartar and escargot as starters and the veal for main. It all tasted superb. And for wine aficionados they had a very nice collection to try from. Bottom line - I have read the other reviews but our experience was top notch
2
Went there last Sat for dinner. Had a really bad start with a waitress and owner. there was a bug on the menu, and we casually mentioned it to waitress. Her response was "it's just a little bug". For a restaurant, dont think that's acceptable. Owner came by, and was unapologetic. Said something like "do you think that's an issue?". Also, asked for an extra chair for some bags. Was turned down curtly by same waitress and without much attempt or sincerity. (the other waiters were great though)Finally, asked to change a waitress. Food was ok, but honestly will not recommend nor return. Perhaps it's because we're a table of locals, but we were definitely not accorded fair respect
4
I have visited L'Angelus a number of times for dinner and even went there to celebrate dinner after my marriage registry.Every time the food is great, from the fish to the succulent steak and wonderful sides. Value-wise it's about what you would expect from a quality steak place on Club Street.The atmosphere is always lively too and the decor is pretty cool with old school posters covering the walls. It's a busy place and would recommend reserving a table.Highly recommended
4
I hadn't been to L'Angelus in years I have to say but having been back I have since been back again.L'Angelus does simple things well and in an entirely unfussy way whilst making you feel that everything is in it's proper place.Portions are more than ample, the wine list is adequate if not entirely thorough and service is brisk but efficient and knowledgable. There are more modern alternatives but for straightforward French fare, L'Angelus ticks the boxes
1
Worst service I've ever had in my life. Took us 2.5 hours to have dinner. Had to ask for drinks 3 times and go inside to bring out ourselves in the end.Owner was rude when asking we complained, saying write a letter to the ministry of manpower about the bad service.Food was average at best.Wouldn't go back if you paid me
5

My first review ever ... Shocking rude staff that could care less about happy customers. Decent food but I won't be coming back.

We are French, leaving in Spore since 5 years. We've tried many French restaurants, L' Angelus has been the most disappointing ever. Given the prices, compare to Le Gavroche or Le Bistrot du Sommelier, our expectations were quite high.Service really bad, attitude was good but due to lack of people we had to keep asking for water, napkin, had to go ask directly at the counter inside if we could get some ice water etc.Fish tartare was ok, then we had cassoulet and duck confit (south west French dishes), come on guys!! charging 40+ for what we had, are you joking? The confit was poor, oily, meat was dry, the cassoulet was blend. Honestly? You must change your chef. Last but not least they did a mistake on the bill, we got the bill from another table... Much higher... Glad we've checked. So sorry to write such a bad review. To end on a positive note I must say the house wine was good.

This restaurant was an unexpected treat, an authentic feeling French restaurant in the heart of Singapore. We dined mid-week and were shown to a table straight away without having made a reservation.The menu was traditional and covered a lot of ground, with plenty of options in both the starters and main courses.We both ordered duck, a confit and roasted breast, which in both cases was beautifully prepared. The food was fabulous but remember to order a side dish if you want vegetables. The cheese course was a stand out, beautifully ripe and served at the right temperature with plenty of bread. For us the main and cheese plate was more than satisfying, although the desserts sounded wonderful too.The prices are high but this is Singapore so to be expected and you do get a good meal and service.We were even treated to an extra glass of wine at the end of our meal by the delightful French manager.One gripe, and it is a general one rather than specific to this restaurant: why can't the prices on the menu include the taxes and charges? We have to pay them anyway and having the total cost would be more honest

Dining in Singapore can often be a bland formulaic driven experience with restaurateurs driven by a desire to “produce” a cuisine and experience with matching designer driven décor and furniture. Not here. The food and wine shows a real level of care and is drawn from more than one French department. The manager was an informed and helpful sommelier with considered and constructive advice including good selections that matched our chosen desserts perfectly. He also checked on the service and food we received several times. I will return

We used to enjoy coming here when we lived in Singapore and so wanted to introduce a friend. We were slightly disappointed with the service. Apparently they are trying to find more staff but it does spoil the meal slightly as the point of going to a restaurant is partly they you want to be served ! They had only one bottle of the champagne we ordered and also only one bottle of the red wine we chose. Dinner was steaks as this is what we remembered them doing well and they were good. As we had expected. Desserts on the other hand were a big disappointment. We ordered crapes Suzette and were optimistic when we saw they would be prepared at the table... The crepes themselves were already cooked. They were just put in the pan and sauce was added.... They were heavy and doughy not light and crispy and all the sauce did was to turn them into a soggy doughy mess. Had I been told that these were shop bought pre made pancakes I certainly would not be surprised

I used to love this place. Until this time when I checked my bill and realized they completely overcharged us for the wrong bottle and the wrong number of bottles of wine. The service was already appalling to start with and then when we pointed out the mistake we were treated even more rudely! Make sure you check your bills!!!!! They tried to overcharge us by sgd 100s of dollars!

I was at the restaurant with a friend for dinner. Food is decent. Forget about service. My expectations from such a high price setting restaurant comes with some service expectations. I was reasonably disappointed. My dining experience is served by a rude staff and other more decent service team. It dampens my dining experience totally. They have an uncanny ability to make one feel that it is through the sheer grace of the service team, one gets to have a french dining cuisine. Since I beg to differ, I will never come back again

L'Angelus... If you want french cuisine, just "normal" dishes, nothing super fancy, but really honest, then L'Angelus is the place to go. Excellent foie gras or escargots! Very good beef with a gratin dauphinois one couldn't do better at home. Nice location in Club Street, very cosy. I would go there anytime again! And i've been there on nearly all my visits to Singapore

This year marks 10 years in Singapore and I have been here many times. Last night a group of us turned up on spec and scored a table outside, sans reservation. Result, as it meant some people-watching was enabled and now Club St is busy as anything this was all good.We had nibbled snacks at the various bars that lay littered in our trail to the restaurant so starters were declined and we went straight to mains. 3 confit de canard and 1 bavette frites were swiftly ordered and we sat back with a bottle of reasonably priced St Emilion to watch people until the food arrived.I am a big fan of confit de canard and I think L'Angelus may do the best outside France in my opinion. Succulent and tender, with crisp skin, it is an art form. The game chips with are pungent with garlic and superbly salty, just right to offset the rich duck. Our steak-eating friend was deeply impressed with his steak, so that was good too, as he paid with the company Amex. Huzzah!Another bottle of red, this time the wine of the month, which was also reasonably priced, and we waddled away pleasantly replete

go for the Chateaubriand steack to share for two persons...absolument Great! Very good and reasonably priced French wines... superb service with a manager trained as a sommelier. ..C'eat bon

Me and my girlfriend ate here. We were a bit in intimidated when we walk in but the staff member made us felt welcome. Menu is good. Food appetizing, delicious and very clean

Good to see a restaurant that maintains the authentic French cusine instead of making the "personal" touch that is often seen in Singapore. Presentation of the food could improve and the service should need a bit of high-end restaurant training (they need to know what they are serving and the method of preparation when asked) but the taste was superb and the winelist impressive and faily priced. The location makes it a great place to start an evening out with french as it its right in the bar and club neighborhood

It was my first time in L'Angelus for a couple of years,and it was disappointing.My previous memories of the restaurant had been happy ones but I thought the quality of the food had declined from what I remember.The evening began well-the decor is attractive,the greeting welcoming and the service attentive.The free taster of a fish mayonnaise was good.Our starters of pasta and of pate were bland,lacking in interest but not unpleasant.My main course of lamb was similarly bland and my companion's of duck confit was dry and uninteresting.The dessert we shared,a rum baba,was not to our liking at all,though maybe that was just our taste buds.The house wines we tried,a Cote du Rhone and a Bordeaux,were satisfactory.I think perhaps a problem with L'Angelus is that the menu is too large.The best restaurants in France have a small menu:I have even been in restaurants where there is no choice,you just get served what is available today,what has been bought fresh in the market that day.A menu this large pre-supposes that dishes are pre-prepared to a great degree,and thus lacking in freshness and usually originality

It was my 1st time visiting L'Angelus, not quite high expectations but given the reviews i've read, was expecting something better.Deco is simple and it was fulled house on friday night so it was pretty noisy and the tables were pretty close to each other which has no privacy at all.Appetizer - started off with Escargots, this is kind of unique as it had a layer of crunchy bread with garlic butter on top of the escargots. It was nice but my friend and i felt it was too salty.Main - i had ribeye medium rare and the condiment was potato gratin, these 2 dishes were rather mediocre. My friend had lamb and she said nothing fantasticDesserts - Chocolate Lava cake, this was 1 of the best that i had. Have to give credits to the chef, the cake cast was thin and soft, taste and aroma of chocolate just made everything perfect. However, the crepes suzette was disappointment. It was dry and the pancakes were kind of thick, the presentation wasnt appetizing too.Overall - Would only go back for the chocolate lava cake. If your a couple looking for quiet, romantic place then this is not advisable

Like Matthew H., I, too, was disappointed. I didn’t have any expectations as the restaurant was selected by a client and I didn’t bother to look at reviews prior to going there. The ambiance is fine, though it was a little dark if that bothers anyone. I’m not sure I’d characterize the wait staff as indifferent but they certainly were not very attentive. Fortunately, we were sitting near the end of the bar and our waiter was regularly at the bar, so we were able to call him over when necessary. We ordered the duck foie gras for four (SGD $158) as a starter. It was excellent, though not as much as I’d expected for the price (two livers sliced at the table). I had the grilled tuna and the waiter asked if I wanted it pink. I answered in the affirmative but thought it a strange question given that in the U.S. one only gives cooking instructions if one doesn’t want it almost raw in the middle. If there was any pink when it arrived the room was too dim for me to see it. It was cooked well done and very, very chewy. For dessert I had the fresh strawberries, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was small and impossible to tell if the strawberries really were fresh or frozen. Out of fairness, one of my companions had the veal and pronounced it excellent. Another companion had the roasted spring chicken and seemed equally impressed.I should also note that this restaurant isn't ranked as high on some other review sites

My French colleague took us here, and the food did not disappoint. The service was great and we couldn't fault it, with great ambience and an interesting menu. The Terrine de Foi Gras was superb, and I had Magret de Canard (Roasted French duck breast) which was excellent. Good wine list also and one of my colleagues had Scottish salmon cooked in paper wrapping which looked superb. As my French colleague said, the chef is French and it shows

My hubby invited me to dinner for our 3rd wedding anniversary. L'Angelus came highly recommended by our Swiss/French friends as having an authentic French menu. Besides the high quality of French cuisine, we were especially impressed by the immaculate service that Thierry (Directeur De Salle) provided. He received at the entrance upon our arrival and immediately ushered us to the best table in the house, private yet unsecluded. Throughout the entire dinner, he always ensured that we had everything we needed and there was literally no waiting time for arrive or food.Heading a 2-men service team in a full house, it was truly no easy feat to keep the diners happy and satisfied in which Thierry succeeded very well.It was truly a magnifique dining experience for our romantic anniversary dinner. We will definitely be back again

My expectations were high based on previous reviews. Needless to say I was disappointed.Firstly I didn't find the staff particularly welcoming. We were the first to arrive for dinner at 19:30, it was hard to get a smile. Secondly, the staff were discrete but slow and we had to ask to place our order and it felt like an eternity before our plates were removed.The menu is quite extensive but they didn't have what I wanted, crayfish. I settles for a grilled fish, which turned out to be nothing special and expensive at over 50$. My girlfriend had a bavette which she found extremely oily and hardly touched.The restaurant itself is pleasant and offers a quality environment. My experience was disappointing to say the least. I won't go back.

Amazing restaurant, service was fantastic, all the waiters were very knowledgeable about the food and wine served in the restaurant. The food was amazing, perfectly cooked, well presented, top quality produce. Simply the best dining experience I have had in Singapore. My husband and father shared La cote de boeuf angus, it was perfectly seasoned, top quality beef - mouth watering. I ordered the roast duck, again perfectly cooked served with a delicious rich (in colour and taste) fig sauce. La pièce de résistance was the famous hot chocolate cake - Magnificat!!Go and treat yourself to a top class foodie experience. Hats off to the chef

Amazing excellent French food.
My only very good experience in a Simgapore restaurant.
Must eat are the Escargot to be followed by Veal chop. Best items on the menu.
5
Was there for a company dinner, food was fantastic as was the wine.
Prices were reasonable and the service OK.
Location-wise, also good as there are plenty of post-dinner places to enjoy the night air.

Great food for a lunch stop, price was high but reasonable for Singapore and the food worth it. Has a nice athmosphere and good service
5
I have been a proud regular for many years and never had any cause for complaint.Some diners complain that the menu hardly changes and that, I think, is due to Gabi (owner and bon vivant) understanding what works and leaving a success as it is.I do not think there are many, if any places, in Singapore to rival the ambiance here leaving it booth perfect for romancers as it is for business lunches.I cannot rate L'Angelus high enough.Absolutely love i

As a french, I lived in Paris for 15 years and I have been very delighted to find out L'Angelus in Singapore. I immediatly felt at home ! After having tried many fake french restaurants (poor set, industrial food), finally, here is the good one. Home made cuisine (tasty and delicate) very good wines at a reasonable price, "service a la francaise" and french patrons ! For business, with friends, with your wife... or your ''maitresse", c'est l'endroit où il faut aller

Went there last Thursday at National Day, ok was bit empty but didn't bother us. The service and Food was excellent, I was bit worried because sometimes these Restaurants in Club Street are Full of Guest anyway and I guess most Guest are just there to enjoy the Atmosphere, so some Restaurants might get bit sloppy with Service and the Quality of the Food, however L'Angelus was seem to made an exception, only little manko my Dover Sole could have been a little more Cross but that's all to complain about, nice Atmospahre like a French Bistro in Paris
5
Everything is perfect from the decor to the food to the ambiance... Take a special look at the walls covered of photos of French actors and famous French plays! As for the food, it's how it's supposed to be done! Even in France, it's difficult to find a better place for traditional French cuisine!

Went to L'Angelus for the first time on Saturday evening. Over all experience was good and food was excellent. Some minor issues with ambiance to note:It was Saturday evening around 9PM. A couple walked in wearing flip flops, beach short and tank tops. I was surprised the restaurant did not tell them they were not dressed appropriately. I don't want to go to a fancy restaurant and spend over 400.00 ( for 3) sitting next to people who look like they should be in a hawker centre. The restaurant should consider the feelings of the other guests. Some are there for special occasions and this just put a damper on it. Also, the wait staff and maître d left the restaurant before we were finished and after we had paid. (11pm) We were only finishing up our coffee. Felt a bit slighted to see the maitre d across the street at a martini bar after we left L'Angelus. It would have been nice to be thanked for our business and made to feel like our evening was complete.Iif you are looking to impress an important client or someone special - this may not be the place to take them. My humble opinion

This would be one of my favourites in Singapore: friendly, straightforward and delicious French fare. The prices are on the expensive side, but this is Singapore and French food tends to be pricey.We had the streak tartare -freshly prepared in front of your table, the onion soup and the grilled foie gras.The bistrot has a basic but workable wine list: we went for a couple of glasses of Côtes du Rhone and some sparkling water.All selections were delicious and well presented, and the staff was courteous and professional. We did not have dessert, as the mains were quite filling.Expect to pay about SGD120 per person with light wine consumption.In all, a very pleasant evening. We are coming back to L'Angelus
5
If you are looking for good quality and pretty authentic bistro style French food this is one of the places in Singapore to have it. Definitely go the Escargot for starter, assuming you like this type of thing, all the mains are great with good options for all tastes. My favorite is the duck and always check for what's on specials for the day. Wine list is good with a fair selection and a good range of pricing for Singapore.As with most good French restaurants be weary as the portions, both starters and mains are generous and generally very rich, have rarely gotten through three proper courses so if you are not a big eater decide early whether you are going for desert, if you like it there are great choices and the Creme Brûlée is almost a must
1
The food is pretty good but not for the price. The service is awful!
5
The steak tartare is made fresh at your table! Tastes like heaven! If you want quality, generous French food with a very affordable wine list you have to go here!
Merci & a bientot!

The Cassoulet and cheese platter were excellent! Would recommend
4
Generally nice food, but very expensive for basic bistro cuisine. $46++ for Cassoulet, which is basically a bowl of baked beans with some lumps of meat, is a bit of a cheek. Nice ambience & good service, but I left feeling slightly ripped off in terms of value

A very basic interior design. We could have expected better French touch to beautify this nice shophouse in the heart of a historical street of Singapore. Very dim light, dark enough to hardly decipher the menu. Fortunately, the service was fine and courteous. The main issue was the food. The menu is very poor, proposing the same skinny shortlist of stereotype French food that several so called French Restaurants in Singapore serve at exorbitant price, under the pretext that French food is very special. Hundreds of other delicious French recipes are left aside, presumably because they are longer to prepare than heating the content of a mason jar in a microwave. The duck confit that we ordered was by far overcooked and stringy. The home made chips were dripping with oil, dark and hardened by overcooking. The bread of the onion soup was impossible to chew due to a cheese layer harder than a sole. We were not taken by the pricey wine. Only the chicken was nice. But it can’t justify the astronomic bill we had to foot. Not to mentioned that our successive remarks to the waiter on the cooking issues didn’t have any impact on him or on the management. We felt totally cheated and scandalized. French cooking can offer such inventive and diverse tastes at reasonable price. It is sad that some unscrupulous entrepreneur make their business on local attraction and ignorance for French cuisine. Don’t waste your time and money. There are some other reliable French restaurants in Singapore

When I eat at L’Angelus, it reminds me the Brasserie atmospheres we have in France. The place is lovely and nicely decorated with old French advertisings. The service staffs know about French cuisine, they easily give advices on the menu without pushing orders. They are thoughtful, taking back your empty dishes once you finish.Last time I went there, I had a Lyon Sausage as starter. This is quite exceptional to find such a classical French dish in Singapore and it was delicious. This kind of sausage contains pistachio; it was served with roasted potatoes. For the main, I had a perfectly medium rare cooked lamb with gratin Dauphinois. My Singaporean friend tried to prevent me for eating the lamb: he was scared I have a food poisoning because he thought the meat was undercooked! I have noticed that most people like very well done meat here but a good meat must be tender and tasty, therefore rare. Overcook a meat makes it dry and takes all the flavours off. Some French people even like their meat so rare we can still see blood at the core!! Anyway, the Chef at l’Angelus knows how to cook a good piece of meat, the lamb was perfect!The dessert was maybe my favourite. No one should leave the Angelus without trying the thin apple pie a la Normande served with a cinnamon ice-cream! The chocolate lava cake my friend too was quite common compared to the desert I choose. We spent about $100 to $120 each what is quite correct for the quality of the food served. The prices for the bottle of wine are reasonable as well.To check more restaurants, visit my blog: http://www.frenchrestaurantinsingapore.blogspot.com

When you step into L'Angelus, you certainly step into a little bit of France. This is an expensive restaurant but a great little one. Mains are around $40-50 and the starters around $20. I've lived and cheffed in France and the snails were the best I've come across especially when you put their greasy bread topping to one side. We each had the steak tartare, mixed by the front of house staff behind us and accompanied by fries. I have to say though, I love my food but this was too big a portion and just the right size for two to share. The same can be said for the creme brulee. When we go back I think we'll go all lady and the trampy and share each course. I think L'Angelus would be better served by cutting the portion sizes which would let them cut the prices. Until then... just share your meals! We had superb service despite the restaurant being full
5
The Chateaubriand carved at the table and potatoes dauphinoise that came with it were amazing! As were the blinis with caviar. The service was very good, wine was always topped up and even though we arrived quite late were not rushed at all. The wine list is good and really there is nothing to complain about. The place has a laid back homey feel feel to it so it is comfortable even if you are not dressed to nines. I went with a visiting friend and she is still a month later emailing about how great it was! I think its good for dates, with friends and groups and because the food is so good, also for business dinners
5
Verdict: This place takes the top spot for the best food experience I’ve ever encountered. My main meal was fantastic and the dessert topped things off. Fortunately, I got to eat a reasonable portion of my cousin’s creme brullee which was absolutely amazing. He too thoroughly enjoyed his mains, wine, and dessert. Look past the price tag, this place is a must try. At least come in for the creme brullee. Please!Price: ExpensiveTaste: DeliciousValue: ExcellentRecommendation: Highly Recommen

Went there 3 times for complete meals and I have to say that I enjoyed the experience a lot. The food is exactly the same quality as during my childhood (I'm French), homey style and tasty. Foie gras, Salade nicoise (the true one, with green beans), Crême brûlée (not heavy on the stomach, not too much sweetened). All these classical are done quite well, and in a generous portions... The cheeses are just mature and tasty enough, and the wine selection very worth for the price. Yes, the service is sometimes relaxed (not a person constantly looking over your shoulders), but, in my opinion, much better if you wanna appreciate the authentic atmosphere and the good food. Not the mention the excellent bread that comes with your plate and the free appetizers (peanuts and olive). This is the place to go for tasting wine and cheese, less hyped but much more worth than Wine Connection for instance..

Excellent food ant atmosphere.

I have lived in Singapore for over 10 years and have frequented this place a lot on the basis it was reliable - although never fantastic. We went with some friends and the food and service can only be described as very ordinary. I think this place has had its time and although the rude staff used to be a bit of a novelty........its now got tiresome. I have been there a lot but i would never go again
1
Both the service and the food are well below par.Service: what's the point of putting tables outside if you're not going to to station a waiter outside? I had to walk in to ask for our bill!Food: I've had better beef cuts at hooters! Super premium prices for cheap beef cuts, overpriced everything. Meat under cooked. (asked for medium rare, got a cow that talked back to me)Overall, no reason to go back there with so many great choices in Singapore

L'Angelus is a romantic French restaurant tucked away in Chinatown. It has a real Parisian flair with classic French dishes. Food is amazing, it almost makes me want to move to Singapore.Last time I was here we had pan-fried foie gras, goats cheese salad and escargot for entree and confit duck for main. The escargot was amazing but I wish I hadn't eaten on the plane as I would have loved to have the steak tartare also. Good wine selection also.L'Angelus is a place to go and enjoy with good friends or someone special
1
... if you are looking for authentic Parisian service, this is the place to go... the wait staff all seem to wish they were somewhere else, and the manager (French) has that certain je ne sais quoi which let's you know you are only there out of his kindness and not because you are a customer..
3
We ordered two kinds of dessert here - the chocolate cake with a molten chocolate centre, and a tarte tatin, both served with tiny scoops of ice cream. I'm a sucker for good dessert and I loved both of them! I would've rated this resto higher if not for the rude server. I believe that a good meal turns fantastic if service is excellent, unfortunately, ours is the opposite. I'd still want to come back, though, to try their main courses
