Always my first choice dining place for lunch. Set lunch is affordable with flow free of drink and small salad. Pasta comes in big portion. Everything is delicious and the staff are approachable +friendly.

They have upgraded their hamburger which is much tastier now No frills jap-western food with a good price that will not break your bank.

Not the greatest selection of Italian dishes but well worth the visit. Ribeye steak (Aussie) at only S$11.90 which was a quarter of the price on Clarke Quay. Reminded me of the old UK Wimpy Bars with the layout, mostly local clientele with a Japanese waitress! :-

On our fist jet-legged day in Singapore we needed something quick and inexpensive for dinner. Our hotel suggested we walk over to Clarke Quay, go inside Liang Court Shopping Mall, and check out the Italian restaurant upstairs. We entered as doubting Thomases but quickly changed our minds. Not much atmosphere here but the service was great and the food surprisingly good -- everything from Oregano Pizza, to pasta, to steak. And the prices were fantastic

Surprised to see this Italian restaurant in Singapore. I dined here often when I was briefly stationed in Japan close to 20 yrs ago. Just had to try it out again. Saizeriya is known in Japan for good food at affordable prices. Hence, it was so popular even with students and there was always a queue at peak dining hours. Their menu in Singapore has obviously changed but they still carry my favorite - beef hamburger and egg. This time, it came with gouda and mozzarella cheese with potato wedges. But rice can be ordered separately.I paired my order with a small side salad and refillable glass of orange juice. Brought back good memories. Saizeriya was and still is a winner.

I celebrated my 24th Birthday here last August 9 ,the same day as the Singapore's National Day. The staff were efficient and fast. Also, they were very attentive in attending our needs. It was a joyous day combined with the aura of the place that is simple, cozy and private. We were able to enjoy our time together and had a lovely lunch!

Wanted some comfort food for the kids and this place hit all the boxes... great price quality value although portions are on the small side but the taste is spot on... So if you are really hungry start with one portion and order a second if you are still hungry, the service is fast ..

We have been eating at Saizeriya many of their outlets eg Liang Court/Toa Payoh/City Sq & Rivervale Mall for many years. Tonight dinner was a disappointment for the family at Rivervale Mall. Everything goes horrible wrong. Main course came first the soup & Salad was last to served. Food is from good to bad to worse. The standard of the food have drop drastically. Don't think will visit any of their outlets.

Came across this place whilst strolling through Liang Court. Part of a chain of "Italian" style food we were presently surprised. You can mix and match quite a variety of small reasonably priced dishes and share accordingly. A one time pay for unlimited soft drinks seems great for the kids as well. We shared a pizza, chicken stew and some lasagna and was quite filling and with a tiger beer came out to S$30. Went back next day for a quick single pizza and a beer. Prompt service, clean and efficient staff. Just a place to go to get away from some of the higher cost restaurants and eateries around Clarke Quay

If you are looking for an inexpensive meal near Clarke Quay the food here was great. The restaurant is in a shopping mall and has cafe style decor . The service was quick and efficient .

Seemed unusual being an Italian place but we gave it a shot.
Very quick service, great menu choices, good decor, comfortable booths.
Food was excellent, and at a low price.
Just noticed they have a few stores - will look for them again.
Highly recommended.

Who would have thought an Italian restaurant in Singapore .... A very surprising gamble that paid off. Little joint tucked away in the Laing shops was very nice flavored risotto and reasonable steak. Would definitely
come again!
4
A wide range of Italian dishes:pizzas,steaks,spaghettis,salad,wine selection and drinks.
The set menu are real value and is very popular with school kids,family and lunch office workers.
Service is fast and the space is clean.

My GF and I tried Saizeriya at Liang Court, and we were pleasantly surprised that for under 40 SGD we could order two sirloin steaks, a bolognese and two drinks. Food was served quite swiftly and piping hot. Drink was self-served and free-flow. Every table had a call bell to alert the waiter. Last but not least, there was no service charge and Goods & Services Tax. In general, we enjoyed the meal. However, we noted that Saizeriya was no fine dining restaurant. It was more like a family restaurant, and at meal times could be rather crowded and noisy

This Italian restaurant is in the Liang food court. Very Limited options for vegetarians but Reasonable taking into consideration the location - Clarke Quay. Being vegetarians, we ordered(1 mushroom soup, 1 corn soup & 1 vegetarian pizza) everything possible from the menu and total bill inclusive of taxes was S$ 13 - that's it

We've had Saizeriya in Japan and it's considered one of the value family restaurant. Decent food and cheap prices. In Singapore, the price while cheaper than most other Japanese restaurants, still is just about the same as food court prices.The pasta and risotto tasted better than how they looked, wasn't bad at all. However, they are not very appetising at first glance. I would try the mentaiko pasta again if I happen to have a chance to go back

Very reasonably priced restuarant tucked away on an upper floor of the Liang Court Shopping Center adjacent Clarke Quay. Plenty of choice from pizza to steaks and pasta dishes all served quite quickly. You can get refillable soft and hot drinks which is unusual in Singapore and ideal if dining with children.Menus are on the tables - when you're ready to order you just ring the bell and someone will come over. Prices are exactly what you see on the menu i.e. no extra VAT or service charges.You pay the bill on the way out. The are no rest rooms in the actual restuarant albeit there are some in the Centre very nearby

This restaurant serves average value for money Italian food that is popular for its pizza, pasta, and free flow drinks. There was not much customers during dinner time when we went there as it was a public holiday (most of the shops were closed). Service was prompt but the orders got mixed up with another table as the one who served us seemed to be quite new. Although one senior of the service crew, Bee Bee, was able to handle the situation very well and took over our food orders. Good one

This restaurant chain serves Italian-styled food that is value-for-money. You can order chicken spaghetti for as little as $3.90. We would normally order grill pork slices, pizza, sirloin steaks, corn, etc. Free flow of drinks cost $2.80 per person (kids' drinks cost less). While the food may not be true-blue Italian food, they are really bang-for-buck, and service is prompt too.

Cheap and GOOD!
great and affordable place for the family and teenagers!
good selection of food but the pasta are not fantastic. Tried the carbonara and was not good. they have a kids meal now and the pasta was not good too.

This is a very reasonably priced restaurant near to the Novotel in Clarke Quay. The salad and squid dish that I had was very nice. The service was good, the staff friendly and the price was was very reasonable compared to nearby Clarke Quay.

It's budget restaurant for family, a lot of teenagers and family, pizza is small for adult, but suitable for kids. All dish is all my favorite and very good price.
4
Must try - US Sirloin, Garlic Focaccia, Escargots.No commends for Spaghetti.My friend ordered Carbonara Spaghetti, I tried some , oh my god! It's awful!

- large, impersonal, light-filled restaurant at Liang Court mall- vaguely Japanese-Italian fusion cooking- you'll almost always get a seat without a reservation- cheap, esp. with the free flow drinks.- service is slow but Yfriendly- lots of dishes have got cheese in the

We stopped here for an early dinner and was pleasantly surprised.Appetisers are a nice small size and very cheap at $4-$6. It's refreshing to go to a restaurant where the appetisers are a small size and a small price to match.The chicken stew, fried chicken and chicken wing appetisers were delicious, as was the garlic focaccia.My friend had the steak and veggies for about $11 and advised it was also delicious.You can get bottomless drinks here too for $2.80 each.We would definitely eat here again

Saizeriya provides efficient service so you wouldn't have to wait too long before your food arrives. There is also a drinks bar where you can help yourself to free flow hot/cold beverages for a minimal fee, approx $2.80. I would recommend you to order their chicken wings as well as their Asari Soup. Really reasonable pricing with no compromise of the food quality

Visited this place with two pure vegetarian friends who preferred not to eat in an Asian restaurant (pure vegetarians get nauseated by fish oil aroma in most of the Asian restaurants/food court) and thought Italian could be a good option. We were absolutely wrong, this is one of the worst places I have been to in Singapore, in a city which takes pride in its service standards, tantalizing dining options and mouth watering food delights - this was utterly disgusting place to be.Ordered pizza (most pathetic till date), butter corns (bland) and meat ball pasta for myself (beef metballs were smelling so bad). All together a very disappointing meal but glad friends wont ignore wonderful places in clark quay riverside anymore :

We were supposed to meet our friends and they suggested this place for dinner. Price wise was considered cheap for a restaurant. Taste wise not too bad considering the price.Great place to meet up with friends. Only setback is they close at 10pm and we were still busy chatting.Best part is you can choose to add salad and free flow of drink with just a minimal $3.90. Very very worth i
