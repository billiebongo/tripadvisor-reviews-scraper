If you miss your western food, you will not go wrong with this place. Food is good and cheap and done well. I highly recommend the steak which is very good.

The chicken chop from Holy Grill located in Old Airport Food Centre tastes good, is cheap and the serving size is also decent. Worth trying.

Healthy wholesome food on a budget!
You can tell the owners take pride in serving healthy/healthier versions of grills and chicken chop. The salads and vegetables were fresh and plentiful. Chicken chop sauce was nice but not necessary given their marinade

The NZ and Australian steaks are always great, the cooking is perfect and there is a large choice of tasty sides.
A must-go at old airport food centre !

When I think of cheap and good Western-style food, I think about Holy Grill. I just had a very satisfying lunch of black pepper grilled chicken chop for $6.50. Each main dish comes with 2 side dishes, enough to fill a grown adult till late dinner. The crispy fried fish (fish & chips) was so delicious too! Try for yourself
