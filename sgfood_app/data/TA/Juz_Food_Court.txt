I come back to the Juz Food Court every time I'm in Singapore. I usually have duck with rice or duck with noodles (and a bowl or duck broth) and a Tiger Beer. Order and pick up at each stall and sit outside and watch the people and traffic hurry by on Orchard Road. It's always really good and very reasonably priced. The people eating here are an interesting combination of locals and tourists who wander in off Orchard Road
