The pizza was pretty good, quite light. Service was very good. My waiter knows the dishes and can make suggestions. I loved my white wine, one from Bastianich. It was too bad that I couldn’t stay too long. All in all, a pretty good experience.
4
In this Osteria you can find the authentic and simple taste of Italy,
We had dinner at the restaurant and enjoyed almost all the dishes.
Service was really good and surely it's a restaurant to try.
Not cheap but what did you expect?
5
Excellent food from beginning to end. We enjoyed some appetizers, pasta, wine, and fish. It was a great atmosphere as well. Would definitely go again!
4
Dinner with colleagues, we had some good starters to share (burrata, Parma ham, mozzarella - all great - and fried calamari- had better ones). As a main I had a pasta with an excellent duck ragù. Absolutely worth a visit.
5
We ordered the following dishes and enjoyed them all:Beef tripe alla parmigiana Burrata with beets, walnutsFazzoletti with duck ragu Ricotta GnocchiGrilled whole sea bream Chargrilled octopusBomboliniTorta Della NonnaOur server also provided us with attentive service. I am looking forward my next meal there. Do try.

Went for set lunch just after Chinese New Year that take a break from all the Chinese food... This restaurant served excellent Italian food, even the set lunch has wide selection. Loved the antipasti of beef tenderloin carpaccio, Corzetti Stampati, and Banana cream pie. Service is excellent and atmosphere is really good and you will not get distracted by the people outside walking looking into you while you having your meal because they have window blinds to block out curious eyes. Surely will come again for their dinner

So this is our second visit and came yesterday for Valentine's Day dinner. They had a la carte menu and pre-set menu options. We went with a la carte menu.All the tables were set in white linen with red rose petals. Restaurant was completely full by the end of our meal.We ordered a very simple but common Italian dish, one I grew up all my life, Spaghetti aglio e olio. It was so delish. Most Restaurants can't nail this simple dish and they did. Then for main course we ordered the duck and the lamb. The Lamb came with a yogurt and couscous. This was absolutely delicious. Meat cooked to perfection and the flavor of spices was on point.My duck was ok but one of the two pieces was overcooked/dry. But of of the two I'd def go with the lamb next go around. For dessert we ordered a lemon dessert served with ice cream. It was unique. Although very pricey...it was a great meal!
2
..so our italian friendly service told us and recommended the wish. Well we got some oily overcooked pasta . It reflects the standard of a previous reference point for Italian food. Such a pity to let the nice place down. The buffalo mozzarella was in line with the overall disappointment.
3
The poshness of the location and the glamour of the decor were certainly the best first impressions we got from this restaurant. But that was as far as the charm of the experience went. Besides the excellent dinner company we had, we found the food dismal and the service mediocre. We felt that we were constantly being interrupted. We left the restaurant, with less fervour for it than we arrived. It was much ado about nothing
4
A work colleague and I dined here on a Saturday night at 10pm, and so glad we chose Osteria Mozzarella over the many restaurants on offer at MBS. In short, excellent breads, and exceptionally good pasta mains (bucatini all' Amatriciana, agnolotti with butter and sage), great Italian-only wine list and very good attentive service. We will definitely return for dinner
4
Went to the Marina Bay Sands to check out the Museum and came across Mozza and decided to have lunch there. Food is very good and wine was fine too. Prices are relatively high due to fine dining concept. Recommended...

We visited on a Monday evening around 9pm as walk-in customers.Service was good, I have to say and very attentive without being imposing. The ambiance was okay although a strange mix of people in shorts (seemed touristy) and customers in better 'dressed-for-dinner' attire. This is where I think the place suffers perhaps from an identity issue; lone gentleman in relaxed attire sat at the bar with beer and food, versus people perhaps that came in there for a dining experience. 'Is it a bar or is it a restaurant'?The Maitre-D was very good - providing reading glasses (left mine at the Hotel) but the lighting was by far too dark as my Wife had to use her Phone light to read the menu - also air conditioning a little too cold to be comfortable.We chose the Chef's Tasting Menu and the first dishes contained bread in both that was far too oily - destroyed the appetisers with 'oily overload'. The pasta dish was tasty although a little dry and the desert (chocolate-coated ice-cream) was rock hard even after we left it for 10 minutes - too hard to be enjoyed. The best aspect of the meal we found was the 'gift' from the Chef prior to the meal - parma ham draped breadsticks - got us quite excited as to what would follow but we ended up underwhelmed.What we did not appreciate at the end of the meal, was having ordered a bottle of wine to accompany the meal and my Wife feeling a little unwell and hence only a Third of the wine being drunk, was being told that Singapore Law meant that we could not take the Wine back to the Hotel Room but we were welcome to come back the following night and finish it off! That was a shocker and we left the wine with them. We felt that at the start of the meal, seeing that my Wife was not drinking the wine, they should have known I was not going to drink the whole bottle and they should have explained this.If it was not for the exceptional service of the staff - particularly the Maitre D - this review could be a whole lot worse
4
Went there for a simple bday dinner, and while the place didn’t disappoint at all experience wise - the service was great, we were well taken care of, and the ambience was perfect - it wasn’t something exceptional food wise. Ordered the Linguine which was a bit of a miss, the gnocchi though was decent. The cocktails were great and I was pleasantly surprised to see Pilsner urquell served. Nice touch. I’d probably go to Bread street kitchen a block down a lot more, but this place is decent enough for a change of scene in MBS. Don’t go there if you want your mind blown though :
4
If you're prepared to pay for insanely expensive meal....try this place out!The decor is all dark wood and very sleek & clean. There is a nice large bar in the back. Up in the front is where they make all their fresh pasta. Neat to stand and watch for a few.I ordered a blueberry, lemon soda (virgin) drink--it was very tasty. My husband ordered a cocktail The Singapore I believe is what it was called - it was also good. We only came for a drink and some Gelato. We ordered the Espresso Gelato. Good portion for only 1 scoop. It was more than plenty and we both shared. Good flavor.the ONLY negative, however, I'm fully aware that it's a celebrity restaurant iIs I think the menu is a bit much. Ribeye almost $200 USD? Burrata mozerella is almost $40 USD...I know it's imported but seems a bit much ...otherwise really no negatives other than price. Bartender was very friendly and spoke to us a bit. Try it out
5
We were back in Singapore to celebrate Christmas and New Year. We left it a bit late to organise a restaurant for New Years eve so ate at Mozza on the 30th. From the time we arrived to when we left the food and service were exceptional. Small things like all staff remembering your name to course recommendations, quality of the food and presentation all add to an exceptional dining experience that we both often talk about. First Class
5
Our dining experience here rivalled anything we've ever had the privilege of eating in Italy.The food is sublime, beautifully presented and the wine list comprehensive. A thoughtful recommendation for red wines to accompany our different pasta dishes was just perfect.We found pricing of the meals and wine to be moderately high, but worth every dollar.All waitstaff here are good, but Stefanie really made the meal and the evening, absolutely memorable, with her cheerful and professional personality. We highly recommend this restaurant
4
Came here with my husband for his 40th birthday while we were staying at MBS. Being from LA, we love the originalMozza so we wanted to give this satellite location a try...and it didn’t disappoint. Food was really delicious. The puglia mozzarella is a must. We both ordered pasta dishes as mains and were stuffed. Both entrees were delicious. Only comment is that I wish the atmosphere felt a little more intimate so we didn’t realize we were sitting in a shopping mall. That is what is so cool about the LA location. It is right off of Melrose and Highland yet it feels like this secret secluded space.
2
I had a late lunch with my spouse and found the food extremely salty. I had hoped that it would have been better than the pizzeria, which also over seasons their meals. We ordered appetisers and a main and all we could taste was the salt. Best to stay away and look for other options
3
I would be remiss to not mention the problems I have with giving money to Batali knowing he is making money from this restaurant, when he's admitted to abhorrent behavior towards women. I will not be going back until he has sold his shares and removed from the business. However, if you are not affected by such news, read on! I've been to Osteria more than a few times and know the staff quite well. The food has always be good and the service excellent. Our meal was good and the wine choices excellent. It wasn't overpriced, despite being in MBS where most of the restaurants are overpriced for the quality of food.Still, in the ever competitive ristoranti Italiani business, there are now better Italian food places, which may not have the woodsy decor of Osteria, but great food and value make up for the luxurious ambience. The Greendale area now surpasses many of these old favorites for great Italian food.However, if you're catching a show at the theater, planning a night out on top of MBS at CLV, this is a solid choice in MBS

We went for lunch yesterday. Reception: Polite & pleasant. We had a reservation which was identified efficiently and we were shown to our table (one side banquette seat along the wall) promptly.Food: The lunch menu is one a single sheet of the paper placemats on each table. Priced at S$48 ++ for 3 courses which you select from the lunch menu (the dinner menu is larger) from the Anti Pasti, Pasta and Dolce (dessert) sections of the lunch menu. There is a Secondi section in the lunch menu but that will cost extra at the a la carte price indicated.For starters, we had two types of mozzarella (buffalo mozarella and caprese mozeralla & baby tomatoes salads), smoked trout with aragula, green beans & minced jalepeno salad.For mains, we enjoyed goat cheese ravioli with 5 lilies, chicken parmagiana with caesar side salad, duck pasta, orecchiette with sausage & swiss chard.Dessert: Slight choice comprising two types of panna cotta, a daily variety of two or three gelato, and affogato. We opted for the chocolate & coconut gelato and Affogato. Both very good.Overall experience: Service was pleasant and fairly efficient albeit with a slight mix up of our starters (as in placing the starters incorrectly) and a bit of lag between our starters and main courses. Wait staff were knowledgeable about the menu and able to clarify specific questions on menu items. Pleasant and fairly attentive service. Food was quite excellent with the chicken parmagiana, goat cheese ravioli, mozzarella, duck pasta being standouts. The orecchiette was a trifle heavier and thicker than expected.Price: @S$375 including two 750ml bottles (one still and one sparkling) of Italian mineral water, service charge and tax.Assessment: Relatively good value for money. Quality of produce used was high. Cooking standard excellent and dishes were sufficiently portioned and generally well plated. Ambience was slightly loud as the restaurant general dining room was all hard surfaces with no carpeting, soft furnishings or drapery and the room (about fullhouse) was slightly noisy. Service was good. Definitely good place for a quickish lunch and for a nice Italian lunch with family or friends
5
We went for dinner with friends. The staff was very friendly and food was great. The restaurant is well designed with nice deco. Highly recommended the following dishes:
Chargrilled octopus
Caprese of Burrata
Beef cheek with bone marrow pie (excellent, very tasty)
5
We had dinner there tonight and loved it! Chose a set menu and dishes were amazing. Great taste, presentation and service.
5
Very classy restaurant - late dinner -very accommodating - delicious food - service was amazing great wine 2 bottles of amarone San Antonio selezioni and the best gnocci I have ever had

During our yearly trip to visit our son in Singapore, we have made it a point to enjoy Pizza Mozza, every year since it opened. We have never been disappointed with great salads, personal pizza, eggplant parmigiana, as well as the wonderful selection of wines. It has always rated a five. The group agreed that we have been remiss, after our visit to Mozza, in not trying the adjoining Osteria Mozza. The concierge at the Ritz Carlton however was unable to get reservations. So we walked over at 6:30 and were told that they, were fully booked, but could seat us in an hour even though the restaurant was less than half full. A little over an hour later we were buzzed that our table was ready. The attractive, comfortable restaurant actually looked less than half full. The dinner started with The Caprese of Burrata, an extremely small salad with okay burrata. The breads which had a moist interior and crunchy crust were excellent. After a long wait the "full size" pasta entrees arrived. The Corzett Stampati was bitter, burned and over sweet while the Bavette "Cacio e Pepe" was overly heavy with pepper. All entrees were cold as well. The waitress was very accommodating. The Maitre d' however came over to hear our concerns. He was rather unaccommodating especially when asked for parmigiana for the Corzett Stampati. His response was: "you don't need it, you have cheese". By then the restaurant was about a third full. Maybe we expect exceptional quality at a restaurant with all the 5 star reviews. Or maybe our expectations were too high. Maybe we anticipated at least the excellence of an "average" New York/New Jersey Italian restaurant entree (as well as the size). And maybe we could do without the attitude, as well. This was certainly not the way to end our trip to Singapore
5
My husband and I had dinner at Osteria Mozza and words can't express how delicious everything was. We had the Burrata Bacon to start with and it was delicious. Then we the sea bass and the best pasta dish I have ever had anywhere. Our server Richard gave us exceptional service, we were actually served by many different people and even served a special treat before our meal. This restaurant is a hidden gem in the mall that is not be missed while in Singapore
5
Outstanding staff from start to finish. Food was excellent from appetizers to dessert. Highly recommend the formal dining area over the pizza section. Chargrilled octopus app; lamb pasta.. yum! I hear the meatballs are amazing too. Maybe try those if I ever get a chance to return. It’s my friend’s fave place (she’s local) and I can see why! Plus, the hostesses are gorgeous! Just sayi
5
I just went to the restroom and I have to say because of me it was one of the best experiences as ever in my life. The quality of the food is astounding and the service was also very very good. The mussels and then the linguini are to die for. Whenever I come to Singapore for me it’s my first stop for dinner and it has never disappointed me. And definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in the world
4
We had dinner here on a Saturday night, the restaurant was full and we enjoyed the experience. The food we experienced was of a good standard and we enjoyed all 3 courses. We also had a couple of cocktails, but we found the wine a little on the expensive side, but this would not stop us from going again
5
We went here late on Saturday night, the staff where excellent and our waiter Jordan did a great job and recommended some very nice wines by the glass. I had the smoked trout with beans and jalapeño and toasted almond followed by the linguine, clams and more chilli, my wife had just a main the agnolotti with butter and sage, all the meals including a side of baked cauliflower, where fresh and very tasty and filling. We got a taster to start from the chef and a very nice parting chocolate. Cost us about $250 which included a couple of Cocktails, not over the top for what we got. If we had the time we would go back. Also very extensive pizza menu in their sister restaurant next door
4
Best service n attentive staffs as ever. Pasta were excellent and so is the cocktails and steak however all the side dishes that I've tried (the broccolini, the baked potatoes, and the cauliflower) are just way too salty (which is y I rated this as 4 stars). Just go easy on the salt!
5
Perfect place to enjoy a tasty Italian pizza and not only as the food is very good.
A little bit pricy but you are in the most luxury mall in town so understandable. Service good
3
Osteria Mozzaoffers good italian food, slightly overpriced if you choose A la carte. The set menu seems to be a big hit, maybe we should give it a try as we found our dishes to be average
5
Simply the best Italian food outside Italy. Service, attention to detail and atmosphere all stunning.
But not the cheapest food, although great value.
5
It's very nice place for meet friends. They got Singapore's best restaurant 2016/2017. Foods were delicious all plates.
5
Mario Bataliâ€™s Restaurant at Marina Bays Sands. Dinner was booked throughout the weekends but we managed to get a table for lunch. Very popular over the weekend amongst the expats looking for some good food and selection of cocktails. Attentive waiting staff with good recommendations of the popular dishes. The lunch and dinner menus differ. But for lunch, I would say these are my recommendations - butter lettuce salad and mozzarella with tomatoes for appetizers. Mains include Pici ala carbonara pasta (small portion but rich), duck leg and the wagyu. The vegetarian ravioli and meatballs with cheese were alright but lack some seasoning in my opinion.
5
We visited with our two young kids and our friends and had a delicious lunch. The trout starter was ok but the duck main was delicious. Even the lettuce it was served on was tasty. We shared a number of desserts and they were all fantastic but the chocolate and coconut sorbet was one of the best sorbets I've ever had. Would happily return
5
Started with two of the signature cocktails, which were very good. We shared the mussels off the chef's tasting menu (which you can order la a cart). The mussels were divine, big and juicy with a tomato herb broth, that my husband ended up eating like soup. Make sure to get extra bread their focaccia is delicious. Due to the time restraint, we were going to a show we each ordered a pasta dish and both were delicious. You have the option of ordering a mid or main size. The mid was perfect for us. Thank you to our server for recommending the perfect bottle of wine for our meal. We will be back, to spend a few hours and eat as if we were in Roma
5
Made a special effort to get to this restaurant during our visit based on friends recommendation. WOW! Italy in Singapore, Italian food at its absolute best. We shared entree's and then had the small pasta for mains. Pasta cooked to perfection as were the entree's. Funny enough we had room for desserts! If you ever get to Singapore, try this restaurant.....gluten free pasta was also available. Having raved about the food, it wouldn't be fair not mention the staff, who are professional yet very accommodating.....another plus!10 out 10
5
This is probably the only time we have double dipped a restaurant on a holiday before but we loved this place so much the first time we knew it was worth a revisit. Every meal we had was excellent which included calamari, beef carpaccio, pasta dishes, steak...all excellent. The staff also made some really great wine pairings by the glass for our courses and each time was bang on. If you are after a nice Italian in Singapore I can recommend this.
4
A great selection of Italian / European fare at this bistro/bar in Marina Bay. Served in tapas style the choices are all unusual and all good. The flatbread pizzas are great, the salads and meat dishes tasty treats. There is a good selection of wines & beers as well as cocktails and juices. I've been back a few times and its always consistently good
5
I can't say enough about this restaurant. Every dish was mouth-watering. I'm glad I didn't spend much longer in Singapore or I would have put on another ten pounds eating here every night.
4
We had another great time at Mozza, since we love Italian food! The best Pizza in town, if not in Asia. The Sicilian Cannoli are awesome!
5
I was one of those who were elated upon hearing the news that Osteria Mozza was to open at Marina Bay Sands a few years ago, having experienced their sister joint in Los Angeles. And sure enough, Osteria Mozza MBS hardly disappoints. The restaurant has a classy look with dark wood decor. Ambience-wise, it feels more casual during the day. You could get by wearing t-shirt/polo-shirt and bermuda shorts. You will see tourists at times, taking a rest and getting a bite, and you wouldn't expect them to dress up formally. At night, though the dress code is still casual, you'll find more people dressing up.We enjoy both sitting at the counter and the table. Sitting at the counter allows us to talk with the bartender, and sometimes they would give us extra shots of digestif of their recommendation (not sure if the friendly bartender is still around now...).Service is quite professional and not intrusive. During this last visit, it just so happened that one of our half-drunk prosecco glass had a bug drop into it. They gladly replaced it with another fresh glass of prosecco without any complaint.Food --- though one or two menu in the past may have disappointed us (the ever too salty Iberico Pork Chop came to mind), but 95% of the time we came out satisfied. We hardly eat pasta here as their secondi always look more interesting. But as they have some pasta which are not easy to find in Singapore (Orecchiette with fennel, sausage, Swiss chard -- for example), we do try this from time to time. Interesting flavor, and nice experience.This last visit, for our mini celebration we ordered Caprese with buffala mozzarella (very nice balance of taste, glad that they use the mini cherry tomato), Umbrian style roasted pork with lentils (again, nice balance of taste, and nice pork crackling on top), and duck leg confit (is it boring if i say again about balance? salty but not too salty, unlike their neighbor dB bistro's). We closed the lunch with gianduja gelato, which surprised us with its size, i.e. too big for us as we are not big eater, but for sure will make some other people happy. Osteria Mozza never disappoints us until now. And for sure we will come back again
1
We ordered pasta, The food were very salty & The pasta were so thick ,rough &hard. Very difficult to chew and swallow. Bucatini was So salty & hard as well. It was the most unpleasant on Italian dinner we ever had on pasta dishes. So disappointed.Hence, the service n restaurant atmosphere is presentable.
5
We decided to have a light dinner at Mozza before heading off to see Cirque de soleil Kooza for my birthday and it was such a delicious meal!We started off with Caprese of Bufala Mozzarella and the bufala was so tender, and delicious perfectly paired with the saltier pesto and tasty tomatos. The bruschetta was piping hot and crispy and soaked beautifully with garlic butter and this was the perfect starter!The house made bread was also excellent. In particular the foccacia and the sourdough! So good and tasty and we could have eaten it non-stop.I had the Orecchiette which was so lovely, the flavor of the sausage and the texture of the pasta just lovely. My boyfriend had the Matagliati, the duck ragu was just so rich and tasty. We could have eaten double portions of the pasta! Staff was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. We had a great quick dinner at Mozza and would love to return to try other dishes
5
Awesome pasta, excellent service and great music selection. We had the orrecchiette, ricotta gnocchi, caccio e Pepe and raviolo and they were all outstanding. Funny as it sounds the side order of tomatoes is outstanding. Only caution is that this place isn't cheap but it is definitely worth it
4
They have one of the best pizza in Singapore! The squid appetizer is a MUST, but it is quite pricey, S$ 18 for two small skewer, but its worth it! They also have good wine selections. You need to book ahead since they are always full.
5
The other half to the restaurants owned by Mario Batali at Marina Bay Sands. I decided to try the restaurant out on the first night in Singapore and didn't regret it. I started off with a caprese of Bufala which features vine ripened tomatoes and a pesto. The waiter also offered some bread to go along with the meal. This was amazing and would recommend it to start of your meal. This was followed by a tagliatelle with oxtail ragu which was on point. The flavour combinations worked perfectly. I enjoyed this meal with a Limonata di Basilico e Menta (Limeade with Basil and Mint) which was very refreshing.I came in without a reservation at the peak of the dinner service and they were able to accomodate me at the bar. This is a great spot to sit watching the staff making the cocktails. The service and quality of the food was great. There is a great ambience and a perfect spot for celebrations, afterwork gathering and events. I highly recommend this restaurant. The prices are definitely on the higher end but when you eat this well it doesn't bother me.
5
Dropped in without a reservation around 6pm with my wife. Luck to get a table as the place quickly filled. Prices are not cheap, specially the wine...but then nothing in Singapore is cheap. The speed of service and food quality was outstanding. The staff did a great job with explaining the menu. Would visit again when back in Singapore.
5
We have been coming to Mozza for many times and never disappoint us. You name all on menu they are perfect for my taste. Had casual lunch or business dinner w opening 3 bottles of Barolo's and we love not just food but ambiance and the staff as well. It's not cheap but it's all well worth it. Ox tail ragu or Grilled fish or chicken are just amazing. Definite place to go.
5
Very good restaurant little to complain. Super quality of the ingredients, good staff, good taste and nice wine. If you want an italian + go hete
4
The service here is impeccable and the staff is wonderful! The gnocchi duck ragu is AMAZING and their strawberry crepelles are delicious. The grilled orata and beets are skippable. It is a very expensive experience but it is a nice one.
5
This is one of my favorite Chefs restaurants! The bread here is AMAZING!!! And the cheese dishes are nicely done! We ordered a burata, tomato and basil dish that was so fresh and tasted delicious! The pastas here are fantastic! And the wague beef was soft and tender with great flavor! I would highly suggest this restaurant to any foodie!
2
Starter was burrata with speck, peas and mint - speck was super salty.Main course of tagliatelle with oxtail ragu - again way too salty.Garganelli with ragu bolognese - guess what? Too salty again.Chicken alla Diavola with grilled peppers & salsa verde - a tad too salty but slightly more palatable than the others. Dishes were rich and tasty, but the excessive salt factor spoiled it for me.When we reached home, we had at least 3 glasses of water each.On the whole, this experience was not a positive one
3
Same restaurant and menu as in LA. The food was good, not great. Atmosphere was average. But it was the service that was terrible. While everyone was polite, service was so slow it was unbearable. It took over 20 min to get our bottle of wine, and even longer to order.There are better restaurants nearby
3
So in MBS shopping, or perhaps "shoppeing", and we felt a bit like lunch and decided on pasta. We headed for Mozza, I'd been a couple of times before and it had been OK so why not.The pizzeria was pretty heaving, but we wanted pasta and headed into the Osteria, which was quieter so that was good.I ordered Orechiette with sausage and Swiss chard, the good lady Tagliatelle with oxtail ragout and I asked for a beer.After a while the plates appeared, rather small portions I thought, however for a quick lunch probably just about adequate. The waiter drifted off so I called another one over and asked for cheese - he stated it was already coming and waved in the direction our original guy had disappeared to. He drifted back slightly faster than glacial and administered a barest flurry to the Tag and went to leave. I asked for some, only to be informed that "chef" recommended breadcrumbs for the orecchiette. Is he paying for it I wondered? I tried it and it was pretty bland so I called the guy back and said to him that I still wanted cheese, which he tried grating onto the side of the plate. What??I stated it should go on the pasta which he did somewhat grudgingly - it certainly improved the overall flavour, but there was no escaping the fact that it was pretty bland.On the other side of the table, the ragu was somewhat over-salted so maybe we should have just stirred them both together.For the price, nearly $80, I am not sure I will be back any time soon
5
Amazing food, even the complimentary appetizer was amazing, we asked of they were on the menu so we could order more the, but it was not on the menu, the waiter end up just giving us one more portion! So nice. Everything was really good but restaurant was a bit noisy it was a busy night
5
This is my the most favourite restaurant to go in Singapore. This is one of my regular spot and have been here many times for last couple of years. The right hand side of the restaurant is Italian casual dining, the other half is Osteria Mozza, Italian European style fine dining. I dropped by this place by chance and had a past with a glass of singapore sling. Most of ppl go to Long Bar for singapore sling for their unique atmosphere thou, this place also provides very refreshing and tasty Singapore sling (more modern style). I had a pretty food impression so I came back a couple of more time. The thing is.. The more I explore their selections of dishes, the more I get to love this place.The staffs are friendly and professional. If you are sea food person, My recommendations are "Grilled octopus" and "mussels". If you like to drink couples of glasses of wine over dinner, plz go with the matching wine (especially white wine for Grilled octopus). They bring up the flavour each other and so addictive. Their sea bass is also very good. If you are meat person, plz go for the "wagyu beef" or "lamb chunks" I am not a fan of lamb in Singapore bc if the chef does not know how to cook, I don't want to even smell it. I took a risk the other day bc I know the quality of the restaurant, ...omg..... I never had that beautiful lamb in my life. The lamb has been cooked just perfect....we both lost our words for a while.. just kept saying.. "wow". My mouth is drawling at this moment thinking of the taste that I had. I found they change the menu slightly depending on the seasonal fresh, so some of the menu I mentioned above might not be on the menu. But dont worry! I am so sure u will enjoy the other food. I almost forgot to mention their desert is so great too. So plz make some room for that. ;p
5
The best Italian food I've had so far in Singapore.Dinner would've cost $100++ without wine pairing.$200++ with wine pairing. Portions of wine was generous.Although I really like Italian food, I can't really remember the names of the dishes.We had a 4 course dinner with a very tasty amuse-bouche. Food was good and the wines complemented each dish really well. It was a pleasant surprise. Would definitely return
2
Had lunch here one day in the pizzeria but decided to try something different from Pizza. I had a starter, the Calamari which was really poor and tasteless. Then i had a place of Prosciutto Ham, good quality but the bread which should be a simple thing, was not good at all. Is probably the best to have a Pizza if you go there. Service was good
4
Food was great but the portion size is small and the price is high! It's like I'm paying this much for what? The gnocchi was memorable, though.
5
The name itself is just everything! Definitely one of Batali's finest! One of our best dining experiences ever!
5
Eat here every time in town, it's great, excellent homemade pasta, esp. The agnolotti, and great wine selection
5
Another great dinner at Mozza. Authentic Italian style, with lively and charming atmosphere and great service. You feel like at home and the team makes an effort of making all feel appreciated and welcomed. The food was of great quality and I was stunned by how much taste and flavour it was possible to make in dishes that seems simple. The secret is high quality ingredients and a strong kitchen team. On that evening i got the chefs menu with 4 servings and they where all at a very high level. The pasta with sardines and olives sounded so simple, but was packed with taste and flavour in a way that made it the best dish of the evening. So great food, superb atmosphere and friendly staff. What's not to like ?
5
After having moved to Singapore recently, my husband and I were struggling to find a decent place to get a good Italian meal with excellent service (a rarity in Singapore). I am always hesitant to dine at Celebrity Chef restaurants, I find them overrated and overpriced and just a lot of hype. Food here is excellent, service is impeccable. It is pricey but well worth it. Once you get over the dining in a mall concept, you will enjoy this restaurant

Having seen and heard a lot about the renowned US chef Mario Batali, we decided to try his restaurant in Singapore-Osteria Mozza. Well, overawed by the experience, we were.My wife started with a smoked sea trout salad, full of wonderful pieces of fish, butter beans, jalapeno and toasted almonds. Just classy in presentation and taste. For me, mussels steamed in a rich broth of tomato, chilli and herbs that you can just eat and eat and dip a loaf of bread in to soak up the wonderful flavoursNext for mains, the fazzoletti -flat pasta cooked to perfection with a rich duck ragu, which was just melt in the mouth. My wife's taglialette with oxtail ragu, equally as good. A simple insalata mista on the side filled with beautifully prepared mixed leaves and a lovely vingarette. To compliment all of this, our charming waitress Stefania from Puglia who guided us through the menu to explain the various dishes, and her recommendation of a smooth pinot style wine from Sicily-Tenuta delle Terre Nere. A wonderful choice to compliment the pasta with the duck raguOsteria Mozza is like Italy coming to Singapore. Travelling there from Australia was well worth it, and certainly closer than Rom

Been here several times and would definitely come back each time i'm in Singapore.Excellent value for your money - service is attentive without being suffocating. Staff is knowledgeable about the menu and when i ask for recommendations, even with the wine, i dont feel like im being forced to buy the expensive bottles. By the way, get the "cheap" Bastianich pino grigio - it is one of the cheapest in the menu but is simply divine (dry, smooth and crisp).You can't go wrong with any pasta and starter you pick. Berry panna cotta is extremely smooth, velvety and creamy. Love, love this place

I love good food but fine dining is challenging with children. We typically dine at smaller owner-chef restaurants where the kids exuberant behaviour is not disruptive. However, we were in MBS for a matinee and gave Osteria Mozza a try. Their set lunch menu is good value and they have a kids menu too, with portion sizes the same as adult sizes so older children do not go hungry. The three children were served first and went off to watch pasta being made at the counter. Not only did the chefs seem happy with that, but manager Will Simons was incredibly proactive in arranging an impromptu pasta-making session as well as taking some photos when he saw that the children were dodging being photographed by their mums. The waiters were helpful and friendly throughout. The food was equally excellent. I have lived in Singapore for over 50 years and this was easily the best service I have experienced in Singapore
5
We attended this restaurant as part of a meal and show package. We were offered a limited choice three course menu my osso bucco ragu pasta was delicious.The only small negative was that the coffee served took a while was extremely cold - was extremely hot when replaced and had to be left behind to get to the show on time
5
The place decor is really nice and welcoming - you have an elegant place for dinning and then a more traditional italian style area for the not so elegant/dressed up diners. Dont get me wrong, the Italian place is very charming, with welcoming decors and more welcoming waiters. The service was expertly professional and cordial, the food was very tasty even if there is not a wide choice but an exquisite one. The food was really great; we enjoyed the appetizers and the pizzas to the last fingerlicking bite. It is a bit on the pricey side but totally worth i
3
Amazing food & service but ambiance wise this place is ok. The music was too loud during our visit & the tables for 2 dinners are too small in size.
5
Had my best two meals here while spending a week on business in Singapore. Modern and classy atmosphere with great menu options. Extra appetizer samples, breads, and a beautiful cappuccino design were added bonuses. You won't be disappointed - a great choice for dinner.
5
High end Italian food and wine. Always full so make a reservation. Service is good and food was high quality
5
I love to eat Italian Food and Osteria Mozza is a little gem here in Singapore. The interior is quite dark, setting a relaxed and easy atmosphere. The best dish here is the Pizza, not too greasy and perfect ration of cheese to tomato sauce.
5
We had a special dinner here and loved it! Having eaten the day earlier at the pizzeria (next door) we thought we would give it a try and we were not disappointed.. It was all perfect, but the caprese salad was exceptional.Wine options were great too with some interesting Italian wines on offer. Loved the evening and would recommended a visit when in Singapore, one of our best meals :)P.s...Agree music can be a bit overbearing at times and a bit random also
5
After a few hours shopping we were in need of a glass of wine and something light to eat and we loved our experience here. We shared the caprese burrata salad - amazing!! Along with the incredible cold meat platter that comes with warm bread puffs and white prosciutto. The Parmesan and fennel salad with a sweet date dressing was also delicious. The sommelier was extremely helpful with our wine selection as we are not familiar with Italian wines and this place has pages and pages of options. We started with a white and moved onto a light red...Iike everywhere in Singapore wine is expensive so best to have help in making the right selection!! Next to the osteria is the pizzeria which is more relaxed, authentic Italian. We liked the moody dark environment and the open bar of osteria and would definitely come back here for dinner again.

If you happen to be at MBS drop by osteria mozza restaurant by Mario Batelli for great rich Italian cuisine. We started with Burata, and had two main courses which were wagyu beef and ravioli with butter and Sage (a tad too rich and creamy for me), and finished with a Rosemary Olive cake and ice cream. Dinner was credible and I particularly like the relax ambience where families and business partners alike sat side by side. A good place not to miss !
5
Stopped in to grab a decent sit down lunch and dodge the afternoon thunderstorms. Turned into a very enjoyable meal.The bustling restaurant has an exposed kitchen, nice traditional dark decor with plenty of space from larger family group to couples.We found the service very, very good. Polite, attentive and professional.We went with the three course menu. Our appetizers were a very generous buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto and a butter lettuce salad.For mains we had the bolognese pasta and the mushroom pasta. Both very hearty and flavourfilled.The deserts were ok. A very dense chocolate tart and coconut gel.Several good red and white wines available by the glass.The restaurant was far nicer than your typical shopping mall affair but then again this is far from your typical shopping mall
5
Had gone for dinner, the place is bit dimly lit for my liking, also the tables are a bit to close.The service is top notch.They a decent amount of vegetarian options. The food was well cooked & portions were average sized.The desert though were average
3
Disappointing dining experience here. Pasta quality was really average - I went for "pasta alla matriciana" which was over-salted and really nothing to be thrilled about and portion is quite small in your plate.Wine pricing is exaggerated and I still did not digest the Barolo glass invoiced 50 bucks... I did not remember having seen such a price on the wine list, but certainly my mistake. Unfortunately it was not the right time to dispute the bill... :
4
A wonderful meal. Elegant ambience. Tasting cheese plate was excellent with burrata, buffalo mozzarella and ricotta. Lamb chops were perfectly prepared. Ox tail tagliatelle was very nice.
4
The decor was amazing. The appetizer of burrata was very good. The pasta was so so. I tried the pasta with Oxtail ragout, a bit salty. A bit to pricey..
5
Simply one of the best pizzas that I've ever had. Chose the brussels sprouts and prosciutto pizza. Had it prepared to go -- and it held up really well. Plus the staff was so nice and helpful.
Strongly recommend.
4
Went for a walk the first evening and ended up out here, big plane with all the italien classics, had e bruschetta as a starter and a Pizza as main, nice staff and fast service all in all a nice experience
3
We ordered 3-course lunch set. The food was pretty usual, neither impressively good nor bad. However, I was shocked and disappointed when I received the bill. The waiter did not mention to us that the cost of the sparkling bottle was $12 when pouring it into our glasses. Therefore, you may want to check out the price of sparkling water first if you encountered similar situation as us.

This restaurant needs to make up his mind.. what is it. Fine dining..no!Bistro..no!It's really every time missing the essence or the finishing touch both in food as well in approach.Come on if u poor a 45 dollar glass of wine; don't come to the table with you wine bottle with a whole system on it that you make sure it will not give u a drip too much.Food is basic, I am not a good cook but this I can make at home as well.This place is clearly focussing on tourists who never come back because I can't imagine anyone would come back here for the second time.Their focus; making money as much as possible from one visit. Definitely not focussed on returning customersGo spend your money somewhere else
5
Been here before and once again, impressed! Service is very good and the food leaves you wanting to come back. Fantastic experience. This is my second time this week at an Italian restaurant and this one wins hands down. The price is fair, portions just nice and flavours explode in your mouth
5
LOCATION Marina bay sands as a back drop is impressive. Mozza does not resemble a typical Italian restaurant. Lights are soffuse, the bar counter is an art work in itself. There is abundant space between tables. The noise is a bit too high though. Overall quite impressive venueSERVICEVery professional and attentive. You never have to look for the staff - they know when you need anything. FOODTruly Italian quality and preparation. Short and relevant menu. Great idea for specials based on a regional cuisine and tradition. Appetizers are really good especially the mozzarella, burrata and ricotta. Pasta is as good as you get it in Italy. Cooked al dente, decent yet not overwhelming portions. Bavette Cacio e Pepe are incredibly good. Wagyu tagliata is perfectly prepared, tender and tasty - I would personally do without the balsamic dressing but I'm sure you can ask the staff. Ample and honest wine list. Price quality ratio very good. I recommend it and will return. CIA

I had dinner with some business partners early in March and we were all very impressed with the food, beverage and service. The Singapore Sling is the best in Singapore! Meals were superb and i highly recommend the tripe parmigiana, i am not usually one to order such a dish however on suggestion from a local we tried it and it is amazing. I will be recommending to all who visit Singapore
5
This meal was literally one of the best I have ever eaten. Service was impeccable, ambiance was beautiful and food was absolutely stunning. I had the gnocchi and it was literally like heaven on a plate. Our hostess, Regina, had an incredible knowledge of all the ingredients on the menu and extremely attentive. Absolutely no problem catering to vegetarian either. Cheeses were stunning, focaccia was delicious. Amazing meal, thank you so much
5
Attentive service staff, food and drinks were delicious and I loved the overall vibe of the restaurant!! Will definitely be back again!
3
Had dinner here and everything was just ok, some food with hit and miss but nothing special. Hard not to overheard private discussion next door since you are basically elbow touching with next tables.
5
Best pasta dishes in town, this is not for the faint-hearted. All the dishes are very well seasoned, from the salads, to the main courses. The mozzarella bar is great, wine selection is excellent and you better finish of the meal with one of their superb Amaro selection
5
I just want to keep it short. The food is top notch. The Colorado Lamb was really really good. It was soft, luscious and we'll seasoned. I also had the calamari and it blew my mind. The batter was light and the the calamari wasn't chewy. The fresh mozerella was tasty and it was extremely fresh. Service was top notch and the wait staff really took care of us. This place is great for those special occasions but please make a reservation before you come. Seats are extremely limited.
1
Had dinner there and the waiting staff were very helpful and we had an excellent service but the quality of food is far from being up to the standard it shall be , the grilled octopus was tough, my girlfriend sent it back (maybe the chef shall refresh his seafood cooking skills ) for the buccatini all' amatriciana the guiancale was replaced by pancetta and no pecorino cheese, the heat came from hot pepper when it shall be black pepper , the linguini with clams came with stale bacon :(((I was very disappointed in the dinner .I think the concept chef should have a mistery guest review organized to get the proper feedback on the food
5
I visited with my wife again for lunch.After our starters and moments before we received our main dishes I asked one of the senior hosts if they had stopped serving the eclectic selection bread at the start of the meal to which he replied it is generally only served at dinner. The same host returned less than 10 minutes later with what he rated as one of his top 10 foods, warm bread soaked in olive oil and brushed with garlic. We were already thoroughly enjoying our mains Pan Roasted Wagyu Tagliata and Eggs and Polpette (with meatballs) when we decided it may not be enough so ordered another plate but this time a beautiful Crispy Duck Leg. My eyes are most certainly bigger than my belly so the 3rd dish wasn't necessary especially as we had been generously been given that side bread dish.Service great as always
3
First the positives - this place has a great ambiance whether you are sitting at the bar or in the main body of the restaurant. The waiting staff are prompt and informed, and generally speaking the food is of a decent quality and an interesting combination of ingredients. There is also an ample wine list and a lenghtly cocktail list.It's also an incredibly convenient location if you are heading to the theatre afterwards, and the staff are good at trying to ensure that everything comes in a timely manner.The downside is that, for the starters in particular, there appears to be a good deal of penny-pinching. The mussels are about the size of peanuts, and relatively bland - though the accompanying sauce is delicious. Likewise for the Buffalo Mozzarella dish, you are served half a mozzarella ball (and I would contest whether it was really even buffallo mozarella) along with way too much of the accompanying condiments. In both cases I think Osteria Mozza hopes that you will just fill yourself on the accompanying bread.The main courses were OK - though our friends who had the meat rather than the pasta seemed to think that the meat was actually pretty good. The Orrechiette dish in the pasta mains was indeed good - but definitely over-salted.Overall, I think you could get lucky and have a great meal here - but you could equally walk away pretty disappointed
1
Ate at the Pizzeria section last Tuesday, food is excellent, price was exorbitant. We complemented the Italian Manager on the quality of food, On his recommendation, we booked again for the Osteria section - the staff dutifully took our reservation for Thursday night. Upon arrival we were informed by the staff that we had no reservation.If this was a backstreet Pizzeria, it would be one thing, but this is a establishment in a world class facility that is the Marina Bay Sands.If you want to risk bringing your client to that establishment and then being eternally embarrassed because you have been bumped off the list for a larger group, go for it

Singapore has tons of choices of Italian restaurants to choose from, but they tend to have strong points on one dish, be it appetiser or main or dessert, but weak on the others. Some may have good food, but lousy wine selection. Osteria Mozza, meanwhile, is an all-rounder. This is why I think Osteria Mozza is the best Italian in town, and best still, for a relatively reasonable pricing.For appetiser we ordered the beef tartar and caprese. Seriously, that beef tartar must be the best beef tartar I have had in my life! It was smooth and well-balanced. The focaccia that comes with the appetiser was so well made, I could not resist to have so much of it!We did not order main courses, but we ordered the pasta -- duck ragu pasta and the celery root capellacci; and both were excellent. Even the potato wedges side dish was so well-seasoned, and presented with fried rosemary! Such clever idea to fry the herb!The desserts were rich in flavours and delectable. The Bombolini and the Chocolate lava soufflÃ© were excellent! as many pointed out, the restaurant carries a long list of Italian wines. I have no complaints on the fact that there are no other wines from my country, but my track record with Italian restaurant is not very good. Fortunately, the sommelier (the half-Peruvian half-Japanese guy) was so very helpful and obliging. He introduced us to a fantastic sangiovese blend, which was so aromatic and of good pairing with our food. He also introduced us to Amaro, which is a great digestif. What impressed me most is that the standard of food and service is so high despite the fact that the restaurant is a relatively large establishment which is so crowded. My hat off to the team. Salute

Mozza never lets me down. We had no reservations ( again) and the folks were so nice to wing a nice table for our party of 4. No fuss or no attitude whatsoever. Everything we ordered was delicious. Particularly, the Octopus. And the lamb chops and the celery root cappellacci. Highly recommended. Great selection of wines by the glass.Service staff were convivial without being intrusive. Everyone including the managers looked like they were having fun on the floor chatting to diners. They make you feel welcomed.Atmosphere. You'll be dining in relaxed buzz without the whole uptight dining feel. Overall, I like mozza because they don't take themselves too seriously but they got all their fundamentals ( food, wine, service, street cred) pretty much pat down.
5
Great food, great drinks, great service. All the dishes are delicious. Fantastic atmosphere. Very impressive.
5
The food was very nice and the service was excellent, to the standard of London. The decor of the restaurant looked elegant and modern.
5
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore! Conveniently located across from the theatre in Marina Bay Sands, it is an excellent choice before or after a show. Smart casual atmosphere combined with great service and amazing food! The wagyu beef is definitely worth the price!
5
The menu is great.
Chris at the bar although busy always finds time to talk to you .
The wine list though not extensive is good (go on, take a splurge).
As usual what you order is what you get.
Great place! I'll be back......

Well this is a very convenient location just across from the MBS Theatre and we dropped in for a pre-show dinner.The service was excellent from start to finish and the staff do everything to help you enjoy your meal.The wine list was my first difficulty - all the wines are Italian and the wine list is based around the region in Italy not the grape variety. I don't know anything about Italian wine so i was completely at sea. Fortunately the waiter knew the wine list well and was able to recommend a bottle that was quite drinkable but not great value (S$95++). It wouldn't hurt to a have a few selected non-Italian wines on the list so people like me can get something we are more familiar with.The food menu didn't have any items which made me think "I must try that". It was all quite standard. The food was all well cooked and well presented and arrived with good timing. Taste was good but just lacked any pizazz. Desert was probably the pick of the courses.The dining room is quite large and has a hard floor, so it tended to get a bit noisy (there was one very loud woman a few a tables across from us). The atmosphere is good and the noise wasn't a real problem but in this price range I would prefer something just a bit more subdued
5
We came here for dinner before catching Chicago the Musical at the Mastercard Theatres and I think Osteria Mozza is one of those restaurants that were built for one purpose - and that is to astound you with its rich flavours, expensive taste and fantastic service. Though the restaurant was quite full when we got there, we did not feel neglected at all as the staff were very attentive and quick to make recommendations on food and wine pairings. We especially enjoyed Bufala Mozzarella, Ricotta Gnocchi and the Tagliatelle. Wish we had more time to really savour the food, but unfortunately, we had to rush to catch the musicale. Definitely coming back for more
5
We are from NYC and visited a few of Batali's establishments there. Although all are solid we always leave feeling that the food is slightly overrated.Mozza in Singapore however is a fantastic restaurant all around. We set at the full restaurant (not the pizza bar) and ate the Caprese (sweet tomatoes from France), the Gnocchi and Cacio e pepe. All were absolutely wonderful. Superb!What was also great is the service we got a from an Italian lady (Stefania?) who started working there several months ago. All of her recommendations were genuine and to the point. Thank you darling
5
I would highly recommend this restaurant. I've been here twice now and everything I've tried here has been incredibly good. Similar standard to Locavore in Bali. You dream about the dishes for a few days.....Not to be missed if you are in Singapore!
5
Excellent place to dine, attentive staff that were onto everything. The food was superb and after eating five courses (Chinese New Year Lunar menu) you left nearly in a food coma. Hats off to the chef who designed the menu as you wouldnt think some Asian would go with Italian and was all paired with great wines.Overall if you are in the Marina Bay Sands area (or anywhere) this place is a must for Italian.
5
Service is good, knows the dishes and details and can answer on questions on the spot. Dishes are very authentic and tasty, the Burrata with ham is so damn good and so is pasta etc. Pricing on the high side but worth it
5
The quality of the food was outstanding. Note, the meals are not large and one needs to order a prima, secondi and mains.
5
Excellent food with great service. Fine dining experience. £100+ GBP easy a meal for two, but everything was so good. Very enjoyable evening. Perfect for a special occasion.
Great memories. Great night.
Recommended.

We were shopping at the Marina Bay Sands and walked past Osteria Mozza. We initially intended to try the pizza but no seating were available. The waiting staff recommended the Osteria instead so we went ahead with it. We were seated in a room away from the noisy bar, which was a pleasant surprise. There were 2 other families with young kids in the room as well. We were quite happy with this arrangement as 1. It isn't as noisy and busy 2. The waiting staff took extra care while serving the tables. The food was really nice, except that the portions were a bit larger than described by the waiting staff (or so we imagined). We ordered the clam linguine, the sea trout and a salad with green beans and they were all nicely presented and well prepared. A nice restaurant to visit with family or friends.
5
I often come here to eat the burrata and the pasta dishes. There's no better place to get an Italian meal for a reasonable price than here. It's a great place for dinner and has great choices of main courses. However I recommend asking the waiter what's good, as the menu is difficult to read.
1
Over priced, out of date and out of touch. Let's start with the blasting of November Rain over the sound system followed by David Bowie's Changes. Both great songs but not what you expect from fine dining. Was explained that loud and "pop" music is a Singapore culture. From someone who lives in Singapore and travels the world-that's an indictment on good Singapore eateries. Service was chaotic. Walked in at 9pm with plenty of empty tables and were placed next to a large group in the middle. We moved. Asked then to turn volume down as we had to shout-Maitre'd said again it's a Singapore culture. I don't think so-especially not at other great Singapore restaurants. Took ages to get a glass of wine and the meal was-well quite ordinary and way too expensive. Was rushed too. Won't be coming back here.
5
Loved this place. Super popular and often crowded, if u didn't have a reservation, chances are that you won't get a table easily. The restaurant is packed up to late hours. We got our table for 8:45pm. Promptly served to our seats, our culinary experience started with much pleasure. A glass of wine, followed by burrata. Oh gosh I loved the burrata! We then had the tagliatelle with oxtail ragu. Flavourful and rich, it's not for the faint hearted. For mains, we had the signature Wagyu rib eye bisteca and the iberico pork. Both prepared awesomely and to perfection. Dessert was a bombolini...well my friends passed on sweets before we all had our shorts of espresso before the night begins! Great job, osteria!
5
Being a huge Batali fan I try to visit his restaurants whenever it's possible on vacation. OM did not disappoint. The menu was precise and the wine and cocktails were on par. We went with the menu a la carte. Service and ambience was typical of any Batali joint- great! You will not be disappointed if you order based on the recommendation of the waitstaff. They know their game pretty well. I thoroughly enjoyed my date with my bf and would go back again and again.
5
We didn't have a reservation, but were able to be seated at the marble bar which suited us fine. We had great conversation with the barman throughout the course of our meal, the amuse bouche was a nice touch, and the dishes were incredible. Perfectly cooked Italian fare matched with equally good service. Since living in Singapore it's been difficult to find a place to eat that matches great food with great service and this certainly delivered. We will be back
1
We had a reservation and were made to wait for our table standing at the entrance for 20 minutes while other patrons were seated before us. Our complaints were met with indifference. The venue is "Osteria" style, decorated with a lot of dark woods, tables are spaced adequately so as to allow for private conversation. There is a long bar at which some people were seated for their meals. Service was professionally overbearing considering the ambiance, the restaurant is after all an "Osteria" located in a mall, the Shoppes at Marina Bay. Point of note it is located just opposite the Mastercard Theaters, so is handy if you are going there for a show. Please be advised that prices are excessively high even though they are in Singapore dollars and portions of pasta extremely small this is done to encourage people to add an expensive entrÃ©e to their meals. They offer a very interesting Burrata Bar with inventive pairings, our table tried a couple of burrata tasting and enjoyed it although it was rather small in size, as well as the smoked buffalo mozarella with prosciutto di Parma which was a generous portion but the prosciutto was excessively salty which is not a characteristic of prosciutto di Parma at all. We also ordered a focaccia di Recco which is a Ligurian specialty and was everything but, it took a very long time to get to our table and was burnt to the point of tasting bitter which made us think they could have brought it sooner and left it in the oven less time. Our table ordered various pastas all of which were very small portions some of them good most of them mediocre and not worth the price. One standout was the tortellini in brodo (broth). This was a ridiculous dish there were 26 tortellini in half an inch of very salty broth and the texture of the filling was grainy and unappealing and it was impossible to define the contents. Needless to say a lot of tortellini were left on the plate at which the manager came over and accusingly asked what was wrong with them and when told he just offered more broth, no apology, no offer of substitution. The entrees were not exceptional The lamb chops were delicious,the chicken alla diavola was fair and the whole sea bream was overdone. They have a Wagyu rib eye on the menu for S$248 which has nothing to do with Italian cuisine in an Italian "Osteria". They had 3 desserts Bomboloni, Vanilla Panna Cotta and a weird concoction I have never come across in an Italian restaurant of Rosemary Olive Oil Cake with Olive Oil gelato of all things. Their wine list is extensive with most wines exceedingly overpriced by the glass and by the bottle. Do not ask for still water because it will be served by the waiter from a water carafe and not a labeled bottle - so who knows what water that is?There was a general consensus from everyone at our table that the experience was underwhelming, did not live up to expectations and was overpriced. If you want to try it out at lesser cost I would suggest going there for lunch or having a pizza at the pizzeria attached to the restaurant

As per recommendation of my colleagues i when to this italian restaurants today its not a very busy dinner the lady server have a chance to let us more about the restaurant and the food they serve. It was a good chat while we enjoying our food it was a lovely night with good food and wine in front of us. Hope to see you again
5
this is our first time here, and i ordered the classic Margherita and it was superb. but best of all, the Aglio E Olio pizza... delish!!! try it..will definitely come back here for a quick bite..!!
5
It is one of the best Italian Restaurant I have ever visited in Asia. It is just superb selection of food, great service and incredible Wine List.
We just cannot wait to visit again.
5
Genuine Italian flavors and ingredients prepared with excellence and presented under perfect quality service.
Appetizers are great, affettati misti, Burrata, Ribollita. Pastas and Gnocchi just perfect and tagliatta the Best!
Wine just perfect...
Sure will be back!!
5
We stumbled across this place and only picked it because it was busy. We sat at the bar and it was fantastic. Food was perfect especially the cheese menu to start. The main courses we had were super. The wine list excellent and the wines by the glass served with the same focus to detail as the by-the-bottle. I tested two of their staple cocktails and they were excellent. Fantastic for family, friends or business. I'll definitely be back.
2
Ended up eating here because the pizza side was too busy (seperate review), the portions were tiny, the pasta was like an entree size and was not even that great. I had the one with the duck and I think my partner had the linguini. All I can say is that it wasn't worth the money and the food was not nice either. Very average and expensive. I've eaten at cheap places for italian and very expensive places and I can tell you that this was underwhelming
5
Staff are very friendly and really attentive to details . The food is fantastic ! The cocktail menu especially the Singapore sling gives all other slings a run for their money ! If you want a romantic experience with scrumptious Italian food , in a gorgeous setting then you have to visit this place !! By far my fav place in Singapore
5
Located in marina bay sand Mozza osteria and mozza pizza are tow section of Mozza. run by American chef , osteri has the best Italian cusiens and great wines, We did not book a table so first we had to dine at Mozza Pizza and then shifted to Mozza Osteria , the resotto and revoali are superb
2
We were staying at the marina bay sands and were looking for a restaurant with the kids.For Italian, this is the only choice. You have the pizzeria mozza or the Ostria mozza. They share the same entrance.We had a table at the Ostria, so can't tell you about the taste of the pizzas.Well this is not only expensive, staff is swamped, look inpatient and very unfair at the time of the bill!We took my wife and I, the ricotta ravioli, which was not too bad and at a fair price.Problem is we ordered pastas for the kids (3 plates of blank pastas) and asked for some black olives aside. We received blank pastas with such a weird taste, and a mixed of green black olives with oignons in oil in 2 very hot plates! pastas were cold and we had to wait 10 more minutes...Kids have not eaten, not even the olives. and got charged 29 sgd per blank pasta and 15 per plate of olives!Staff looked very happy about it, even when I told them this is not what we ordered.As I was with kids and not used to trigger troubles, I paid and told the waitress we didn't ask those olives when she offered me a doggy bag... She didn't do anything about it and only laugh at me.There are plenty of good Italian restaurants in Singapore. Please check well before deciding to book there. Chef celebrity doesn't protect you from poor diner and unprofessional staff. It only insures you'll get charged twice and a half the price

New Year's Day lunch was predictably good in this open fronted restaurant within the Singapore Marina Bay Sands complex. The parma ham and mozzarella was a delicious starter and the goats cheese ravioli followed by the chocolate tart desert was definitely worth the SGD 48++. However, apart from our brilliant waiter Richard the others were inattentive and we had to ask 7 times for a glass of water even when it wasn't that busy! Even the young manager in a grey suit ignored us when we asked him (about the 6th time) as he continued sweeping up the floor! Could be a great destination but someone needs to improve the service to match the food
5
We called and made a last minute reservation for Christmas Eve dinner with a toddler. They hosted us in a classy dining room and asked if my daughter would like a tall glass of chilly milk and some plain pasta with butter, slightly overcooked. Perfect! The wait staff were all kind to the children while still treating the adults as classy guests that deserved to be pampered. That is a real challenge to pull off. Food was ridiculously delicious. We will remember the whole experience for years as perhaps the best ever in Singapore.
5
Great food, great service, great ambience and a great (heavily Italian quality) wine list. Not cheap, but happy to pay for this kind of quality
5
Great location for a nice dinner in couple. The dishes are above standard. The bombolini desert is to die for 😀
The service is TOP !
5
When my food came, I was greatly reminded of European cuisine. This is truly an authentic Italian restaurant. Slightly pricey but really worth the money.

10 out of 10.. shared a few starters the bead and dips it defo one to try. Pasta was faultless, Main was pork chop that was also cooked to perfection. bill for two was $300 and half of the was a bottle of wine.

Visited for lunch based on advice from TA. Sat in the pasta section of the restaurant. Ordered the pasta carbonara. For dessert the ice cream with coffee. Main event arrived - could not believe how small it was. Generally speaking I eat small portions but this is about half of what I would expect in Singapore. Dessert was impressive.Cost maybe higher than average for Singapore. Credit card discounts only if Bill exceeds $300. Not my cup of tea. Overall - unlikely I would visit again - good food but disappointingly small.

Having eaten at the LA restaurant I was expecting good things. Food was OK though nothing memorable, very busy so there was a lively atmosphere (booking recommended), with service being the best aspect - attentive and friendly. Overall, distinctly average for such a high priced restaurant

Where can you find a six course chef's tasting menu that's out of this world, creative, fresh, with beautiful presentations for $128 a person? The same experience in any other major city would cost triple the price! Add to it an encyclopoedic wine list of Italian wines and the experience is complete. This place is an under-rated treasure. It is a must for foodies and wine lovers

Given the somewhat unidimensional menu (loads of cheese loaded dishes, obviously), I was a little hesitant to try Osteria Mozza out. But I can have no regrets. Their inhouse cheese is so fresh and soft that it elevates any dish. While it is a lactose-intolerant person's nightmare, there are more than enough options for Asian vegetarians and meat-lovers. Osteria Mozza isn't cheap, but it is highly recommended for a date night or for a gregarious meal with friends. It's not Waku Ghin or Cut level prices, so I would say its value for money. Reservations are essential

From start to finish, this meal was excellent. We had the set menu, which included an appetizer, pasta and meat courses, and dessert. There were multiple choices for each course, and some of the options were more appetizing than those on the main menu, although there were many crossovers. The caprese of burrata was absolutely stellar, including some of the sweetest tomatoes I have ever tasted. The toasted sourdough which accompanied it was actually better than the other breads which were offered to us, and I actually requested additional pieces, which they were happy to provide. The penne-style pasta Bolognese was very tasty, though definitely al dente. The duck was sweet and accompanied by a bit of frisee with a delicious vinaigrette, tart caramelized pear slices, and fried fingerling potatoes, which we substituted for the Brussel sprouts. For dessert, I had rockmelon sorbet and pistachio gelato, and both had rich flavors and excellent consistencies. The service was fantastic, and I would like to recognize Rein and David in particular for their hospitality. Both the service and the food were presented thoughtfully, and I would highly recommend this restaurant. The trek over from Orchard Rd was not bad at all, and it's worth doing
5
Bruschetta with ricotta cheese with rosemary and walnut is just exceptional. The wagyu beef tasted like heaven! I tried pasta last time I was here. Pasta was perfect as well. The atmosphere is nice and romantic. Service is excellent. This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore! I can't pick one bad thing. Maybe... The price? But the quality of food, atmosphere, service makes it the price all worthy
5
We just had the most amazing dinner at Osteria. Each dish was perfect and well selected by chef Peter Birks. Will definitely be back!!!
4
Situated at the Shoppes Marina Bay Sands. Options of Fine Dining or Semi Relaxed. Great Pizza but unfortunately limited meat options.
Either Pork or Veg options. No Chicken, Lamb or Seafood.
4
By 7pm the place is full ! Book a table to avoid disappointment. We ate at the pizzeria and not at the restaurant. Dress smart casual. Great pizza and lots of vegetarian selections. The chef made us a pizza without anchovies upon request. You can also do a take away and eat at the Marina with astonishing views of the river and city lights ! Expect average price per 10" wood fired pizzas to be around $25-30 ! Enjoy 
5
Our meal and our whole evening were absolutely perfect. We sat at the mozzarella bar to get a good view of all the action, and from there we were able to chat with some of the chefs as they made fresh pasta and assembled salads. We were given excellent recommendations for dishes to try that we might normally have skipped, but as we recently heard in a movie about cooking "Diners don't know what they WANT, they know what they've HAD". And it's true, by skipping our obvious favorites, we found some new and wonderful new favorites.We'd been waiting some time to order the egg yolk ravioli, and it was truly divine. Like Mother Nature's greatest comfort food. It felt like a great big hug of love. On a plate.Enjoy

On a visit to see my grandchildren, in Singapore went out for dinner on Friday night with my son and daughter in law, we had cocktails on the roof terrace at the marina sands hotel, then we went onto Mozza restaurant within the shopping mall. After a short wait we were shown to our table, good size white table clothes just as I like to see. We ordered drinks from a very friendly head waiter, and were given menus, lots and lots of choice, we ordered several courses, all delivered pipping hot, and tasting excellent, the wine list was very extensive mainly Italian just up my street, I poured of the wine list for Age's and chose well every body agreed. Superb evening, great atmosphere, really enjoyed the whole evening
5
We went for oue honeymoon and food was great!! The focaccia is great (we put some procciutto on it, try it) and then some pastas. Also the lamb was great. What we didnt like that much was burrata, it is better when it comes alone and not with all that vegetables. Recommend it!
4
Love the chargrilled octopus appetizer, wagyu beef & their tomatoes are super sweet. The chicken portion is huge & seasoning is amazing. I didn't like their brewed coffee & changed it to Latte which was amazingly good. They have lovely dessert & my favorite is the sorbet - natural & light after all the meat. The only downside to this fine dining - service is slow to suit the ambience. Make sure you've allocated enough time to come here for business lunch
5
We went to Osteria Mozza in October and we were delighted with the service and the food experience.Overall a wonderful dining experience.I book well in advance and this proved to be essential even for a Sunday evening.The atmosphere is of a busy Italian trattoria in modern MBS complex.We decided on the $88 set menu which was excellent value. I loved the Imberio pork chop which was delightful so tasty.This is a really great value restaurant
5
I had the pleasure of dining at Osteria Mozza this evening at the recommendation of several friends who had raved about it for weeks. Let me tell you it did not it disappoint! My friends and I followed the chef's menu as there were too many tasty sounding items on the menu to choose from. Thank you chef Peter Birks for an amazing dinner. The Wagyu beef tagliata was one of the best dishes I have ever enjoyed. Can't wait to return soon

This delightful Italian restaurant is in the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex. Really great Italian Food. We share a couple of starters and a "Little Gem" salad, so simple but crisp fresh and beautiful flavours.Followed this with the Duck Ragout, I think the best I have ever had. Not a lot of room left for dessert but we talked into sharing their version of Bombolino (Italian doughnuts). These were made with brioche and served with a tart lemon curd, vanilla gelato and huckleberries. Yum!Singapore is not know for great service, but the staff here are knowledgeable, attentive,helpful and friendly. The wines for Singapore were a little more expensive but a great wine list.If you want something more casual the pizzeria next door is just as good and family friendl
5
One of the best pizzeria in Singapore which has stoned oven pizza and great antipasti in a cosy place in MARINA BAY SAND area. Bread crust pizza's worthed to wait a bit longer. I advice to reserve a table in advance.
4
Good pizza, local frendly and youth.
Very attentive staff, nice and frendly.
Typicall restaurant in Italian style,but but it is not Italian...but congratulations

We received good advice from sommelier. He is knowledgeable and nice. The food is great. The waitress's English was a bit difficult to understand.
5
This was our second visit to Osteria Mozza having previously attended for my wife's birthday four years ago. On that occasion we were very impressed by this restaurant and our second visit confirmed our opinion. Everything about this restaurant is quality; cocktails, wine list, food, service and very welcoming and friendly staff. I love the mozzarella bar concept and my crusted pork chop was fabulous. We enjoyed our visit so much, that when we head to Los Angeles next year we are going to visit Osteria Mozza LA
5
Food tasted really authentic and produce was fresh. Chef peter greeted us personally at our table, enquired how our meals where and explained some of the dishes! Even suggested what style of wine we should have with our main course! Great experience and will definitely return when I'm visiting MBS
5
Went to osteria mozza with a group of friends and had a blast. The food was superb! We were lucky to get recommendations from chef peter and the dishes that were served was delicious.Every dish was planned to complement one another. The restaurant had a nice dining setting and the staff were all attentive and proactive.Would definitely recommend and head back to osteria mozza again.Awesome

We went there for on a Saturday for dinner before a show at the theater (which was 1.5 hours later), as the restaurant is right across, which is very convenient. The place has a "mozzarella bar" so we tried a couple mozzarella appetizers,which were quite tasty. And then we had to wait quite a long time for the mains. When they finally arrived, we were surprised but not in a pleasant way: the portion sizes are very small for what you pay. If I pay 26 dollars for garganelli bolognese, I don't expect to get a small amuse-bouche sized-dish. It was the same for my friends so we were all quite disappointed. To top it off, we asked for the bill which took a really long time to come, meaning we had to run out to make it in time for our theater show. The staff was really friendly and professional so that was nice. But because of the above we did not feel we got the experience we expected and had heard about
5
My first visit to Osteria Mozza was perfect. Chef Peter recommended a few dishes to my group of friends and I, and we were so amazed with the quality and taste of each dish!Dinner started with some appetisers: Prosciutto and salami, alongside this thinly stretched dough that was stuffed with cheese. We couldn't stop talking about how good the stretched dough was! It was crispy and so rich in flavour, and I couldn't stop reaching out for more. We then had two pastas to share: Tagliatelle with oxtail and a Garganelli with ragu bolognese. The pasta was hand made and was definitely worth every calorie!We then ended the meal with Wagyu beef tagliata and Sea Bream. As someone who seldom enjoys eating fish, I was surprised that the fish was sublime!!! It was in fact my favourite dish of the night, and I will definitely be coming back for more.Thank you Chef Peter for the amazing recommendations! I will definitely be coming back to Osteria Mozza again! :
5
Had a great night at Osteria Mozza with some overseas visitors! The food was delicious, the staff were attentive and we even had the Exec Chef come and walkthrough some of the dishes - amazing! Such an enjoyable experience, we will definitely be back! Thanks Chef Peter and team!

Really enjoyed our meal at Osteria. We've been to the pizzaria a few times and always had great food. So we thought we'd try the restaurant option and were not dissapointed. The food was excellent and food service also good. The only let down was the cocktails we ordered when sitting down were still not ready when our first course arrived 25mins later. We'd ordered a bottle of wine for the food, so decided to cancel our cocktails. The bartender was nice enough to come over at the end of the meal and apologise for the issue and gave us some very nice digestifs FOC. Helped remove the dissapointment of missing out on the drinks earlier. Would go back again as the food was worth it
4
We went here with friends and it's got quite a good selection of pizzas and pastas. Good atmosphere and the service was excellent
5
Divine...
We had some gnocchis and some raviolis, and those were amazing.
Try the bruschetta with chalots, crispy prosciutto and cheese and also try some fried calamari ( just great)
5
This restaurant is simply super! I am Italian and this restaurant is hardly match even in Italy. It's expensive but worth it.
5
Incredible service, inviting ambiance and most of all – quality food and indulgent cocktails! There's always such a positive buzz to this place. What’s there not to love? We ate here twice during our stay. Once at the Osteria and another time at the pizzeria. Different experience but we enjoyed them both times. The osteria is a little more stylish, upmarket chic, with an incredibly delicious Italian menu which calls out to you to order everything on it. The pizzeria is casual, loud and funky. Fantastic pizzas and sides. We will certainly be coming back next we’re next in town

I`ve enjoyed many meals in Batali restaurants over the years and really appreciate and admire his ethic of letting the ingredients deliver the flavor but something is different here. Perhaps the chef has determined that the fresh ingredients need some help. He seems to be inspired by the use of salt.Shame, seems like the farms in this tropical climate here would produce some products with delicious flavors. All in all a disappointment in the flavor dept. Unless you really like salt.Let's talk about pricing. Does Mario know and condone that this Osteria offesr a glass of a decent, but not outstanding glass (small pour) of Montepulciano for 45 sing dollars. The wine by the glass price has risen over the years but $45 seems extraordinary.Batali has built his reputation on great and accessible food for all. This type of pricing eliminates most folks

Had birthday celebration dinner on 3/9/2016. Initially was not up to mark . They served bread without giving any dips . Waiter did not seem to be attentive when requesting for bread n dips . We waited for awhile before they serve us . But as the dinner got along , it was fine without much issue . The birthday cake was served on the wrong person despite telling the waiter in advance . Food quality is about average .For the price we paid , i think they other better options
3
Hubby wanted to take me to a nice resto before watching the show so he made reservations in this resto. Service was amazing and I give the staff 5 stars! The food was overrated ..everything we ate was spicy. From the mussels to the linguine to the chicken...we just didn't want to waste the food so we finished it but it's really nothing spectacular. Maybe the pizza joint beside it will be a better option in case u wander in this area ..
4
Every time I return to Singapore, a reservation at Osteria Mozza is important. This is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore and it rarely disappoints. Reservation is important especially on weekends. I actually wanted to try the pizza place but the draw of what's familiar to me keep me back to Mozza. There's still so much on the menu to try
5
We had a really good time here for lunch today. Had the 3 course lunch and managed to get vegetarian options all of which were delicious and tastefully presented! Regina and Jenny were most helpful with the service and help with ordering. Attention to detail - excellent! Will surely retur
5
We came across Osteria Mozza by accident and were lucky to have a table as we have been pretty early. Being from Europe and eating Italian in Singapore, I had rather low expectations but how wrong have I been. Embarrassingly I have to admit that I had the best Burrata I ever had and the pasta was just out of this world and on top of it they knew what al dente is as in a lot of Italian restaurants around the world, they forgot how to cook a proper pasta. So all credit to Osteria Mozza. I could not fault the food, I just wished I left some space for the desert but will do that next time and maybe you could consider to open a Restaurant in London as you would be a fantastic addition to the Italian Restaurant Scen
5
All the food I ordered was pretty delicious. This place has a cozy atmosphere and nice staff. Need to make a reservation in advance or check availability if you are going there for dinner.
5
Busting location,right in the middle of the Shoppes at Marina Bay.The food is excellent,from the bread served in the beginning to the desert.Courteous service.We are Vegetarian so a special dish was prepared for us without meat and seafood.Reservation recommended.Lovely ambience too!
5
Extremely impressed with the quality of the food and service. All that you want in an Italian restaurant plus reasonably priced for the value. Kudos to the Mozza team!
5
This place has the best pizza I've had in Singapore. All the other items on the menu are equally spectacular.
5
Excellent food and great service. Appetizers and Entrees were both very delicious. They have a great wine selection. The setting is beautiful, posh and classy.
4
I have been to their sister outlet just beside (Mozza pizzeria) and I think price does matter when you want both food and service. I tried the degustation dinner menu and had dishes that were very interesting. They have a decent wine list and a sommelier is ever ready to recommend a nice pairing with the dishes that you are having that evening. Service here are much more attentive, where they are quicker to respond and anticipates well to guests and their needs. Nice and cozy place for couples or business dinner
5
I had dinner with my family at Osteria Mozza to celebrate an occasion. It was a great experience. We didn't make any reservations and there weren't any tables available when we walked in around 7.15pm but the staff asked if we were okay with the bar seats. We were alright with that and were seated where we could see the chefs preparing the appetisers :) We wanted to eat at Osteria Mozza a few weeks before but were told that there were no tables (and they didn't offer us the bar seats so I'm guessing that they were really full). We ordered the chef's tasting menu (note that everyone at the table has to order the tasting menu as well, but everyone can choose one dish out of the two options provided for each course). The wait staff were very patient and explained each dish to us and gave recommendations when asked.The serving portions aren't too big, and the food is really good. I would say the Gnocchi and the Chocciolato were the highlights of my dinner that night. Osteria Mozza is quite pricey so it definitely won't be a restaurant that we visit regularly but it's great for a special or celebratory meal. If you'd like to have a table, it's best to make a reservation

wanted to go to pizza for a quick meal, but could only get table at osteria.No probs with that. I read about $65 pasta. Like where??? not on this menu, any way the only issue we had was the waitress kept saying, "don't order that, its too spicy!'Seriously?? Perhaps the average American has no idea what good food is, and I do mean 'average', as I've eaten at some of the best in America, and they know good food.As I come from Melbourne Australia, we are blessed with great food everywhere, and a little spice is fine.The waitress was a real dud to the experience. Ok, say its a bit spicy, but don't keep insisting I shouldn't eat it!We had some burita, beautiful, & pasta. All good, well cooked sugo & sauce. I wanted the pork but was put off it by being told it would take too long, at least she was honest, but wasn't allowed to order the spicy salami pasta as it would be too hot for me!!!I would still recommend it, don't be rushed & eat what you want
4
We seem to visit Mozza every time we visit Singapore and it never disappoints. It's busy however the service is very good with the staff finding time to make diners feel welcome. The food is excellent as is the cocktail and wine list. Some pasta dishes can be quite rich however there is a good balance of sides and starters. If you're after a good italian food experience Mozza delivers
5
We were staying in marina bay sands and saw this place recommended. I have to admit the food is delicious! We had the mozzarella taster to start at 35sgd which came with four different types and bread and was more than enough for two people. We then had lamb and duck for main at approx 45-55sgd and it has to be the best we have had. Great atmosphere and the staff are very attentive. The cocktails are also very good too.Yes it's a bit more expensive than some places but not by much and not for that quality. Huge wine selection to
1
I went here and the people were uncooperative mean and wouldn't let us order pizza from other restaurant next door with same owner If you're in Singapore DONT COME HERE. They don't even have black label they onley have very expensive wine and whiskey
4
We decided to break and do something different choosing Mozza. We were pleasantly surprised. The quality of the food was awesome as was the service.It offeres a traditional 5-course option but we elected to do three - and it was enough.Food preparation was quick as we never waited long for food.Now the price is high as can be expected. For three folks we spent $100 each. A 10% service charge was included.If you want a trasitional Italian meal though at any cost - then this is the place
5
It's so hard to find cacio e Pepe pasta in singapore. In fact this is the only restaurant in spore that I know of which serves this simple yet delicious pasta. But The dish that I always order when dining here is the Brodo. When in Rome I couldn't find any restaurant that offered Brodo in their menu. The broth is just so tasty, nourishing and really simply must try!!
4
Ricotta spread on fresh loafs and Buffala Mozzarella with red wine was a great start.Antipasti (Italian traditional first course before meal) such as Affettati Misti, Calamari Fritti, Grilled Octopus, and Red Endive, Fennel & Parmigiano Reggiano was truly tasty and authentic. Our EVP (Italian origin) whom we were having business dinner with was singing praises about these dishes.The Wagyu Beef Tagliata is by far the best tasted in Singapore. Would humbly grade it a level higher than that offered by Skirt W Hotel.While all of us were too filled with these quality cuisine, we skipped dessert and signed-off the night by having their aromatic cappuccino and expresso with an added tea-spoon of Sambuca (Italian liqueur). Perfect closure.Great ambience, excellent food
5
Honestly, I don't know how this place got (very few, indeed) bad reviews. I guess it's a matter of expecting a standard Italian restaurant and coming to what the best of Italy can be. I'm floored by the junction of classicism and creativity in Mozza. As appetisers, the warm dates and Speck are a fabulous combination, so is the red endives, fenel and Parmigiano salad (the acidity of the lemon vinaigrette is just perfect balance) The pasta (at least those we ordered) are more on the classical side, but perfectly executed around the freshest and most authentic ingredients. The waiting staff is attentive, knowledgeable and efficient in an unobtrusive way that denotes serious training and management. The bill is expensive but more excessive for the quality of the experience you will have.
1
This restaurant was a big disappointment looks good on the reviews however they do not serve any normal alcohol only 20 years plus single malts and $1000 bottle of wines, un accommodating would not let us order pizza from their same restaurant connecting with it. Beer selection was same all un know high priced, tourist trap we just got up and left paid for our $15 bottle of water and went somewhere else. They have enough high end millionaire they can ripoff they don't need your business.
4
Have always been a fan of this eatery! Went back last night for a quick dinner and as usual am overwhelmed with both food and service! Were seated at a high table within minutes! Order asparagus with prosciutto and parmesan cheese and a white anchovy pizza. Both were nicely cooked and prepared!
5
My wife and I dined there recently, and had a lovely dining experience. I had previously been there for a business cocktail reception where I found the finger food absolutely delicious and the service was excellent.The food was excellent. You could taste and see the extra effort that the chefs put into the food. The waitress also conveyed the chef's suggestion of pairing the various ingredients on the plate so that resulting mix tasted great. This is an unusual extra level of service, as usually the chef considers his/her job done when the dish leaves the kitchen.The wood paneled walls and warm lighting gave a nice ambience to the restaurant. The service staff were immaculately dressed, and you could feel the extra attention to service. The staff to guest ratio was quite high.Although we didn't bring our kids, we noticed that many other tables did have kids. The service staff also ensured that the kids are well taken care of.Highly recommended
1
Nothing can ruin an evening like a bad-tasting meal. The best part of the meal was probably the bread they offered once we'd placed our orders.Chargrilled Octopus was tasteless and just didn't taste good. We ordered some pasta, the beef ragout was too salty to be edible - we asked for a less saltier redo and got a bland, watered down version. Even the pasta was not done well - it wasn't cooked long enough to even be al dente.Not one for leaving negative reviews, but I really would recommend elsewhere if anyone were to visit the Marina Bay Sands
4
My wife and I visited whilst in Singapore, I ordered a trifecta of Mozzarella, Burrata and Smoked Mozzarella. All three dishes were exceptional, and being Sicilian I have had my fair share of Mozzarella!The Mozzarella and tomato salad was particularly good, so I would thoroughly recommend it, the wine is a little expensive, I ordered a Barolo and it was nearly $50 a glass, but it was good which is the most important thing.Service was excellent, and desserts were excellent too, we have booked to go again as we are now staying a second week here in Singapore, so that's a compliment in itself.Excellent work
5
Very tasty woodfire pizza! On the expensive side but definitely worth trying. We had twice on our stay in Singapore. The prosciutto with Arugula + Meat lovers was delicious. There are other pizzas on the list we didn't get to - we'll be back.
5
Awesome mussels and pasta. Incredible meal. Must have. Service is good. Ambience nice and the quality of the food is bloody world class. End of discussion
4
Osteria Mozza is one of a pair of side by side spots in the huge Marina Bay Sands Shopping mall where one feature is restaurants developed by some of the world's top chefs. Mario Batali and the Bastianich group created Osteria Mozza, although Chef Batali is not actually present there. Nonetheless, the food is very good, including many of Chef Batali's familiar specialities from his places in New York. Service is friendly and competent, if a bit over-eager (I don't need to have five different folks check to see if my meal is enjoyable!). The prices are a bit high if you are not used to prices at comparable spots in cities like New York or London. Overall, a worthwhile spot dinner, if you have any cash left from shopping the very upscale shops
5
We walked in without reservation one weekday afternoon lunch time. We got the bar seats but on request, the staff kindly tried her best to find table for us as fast as she could, so after around 20 minutes seated on the bar, we were move to a table. I have to compliment the staff for going extra miles for us.The food that we ordered (meatballs, salad, 2 kinds of pizza) were very good and we could taste the freshness of the ingredients. Bill is steep but worth the experience we got.Seatings at the bar was actually fun too as you get to see the kitchen stuff prep the appetizers and pizzas in front of you.
4
The service was great. My family went for their brunch on a Sunday. They guessed that we were going to share the food so they were nice enough to ask us before that. The food was definitely good.I would definitely recommend this place if you're willing to spend the money. Good food without the fuss of fine dining
3
We thought the food was good but could've been better coming from a famous chef restaurant. We don't recommend the mocktails. However, service was excellent. Although we wouldn't go there again, we had a good time together and could recommend this for couples who want to try out an award-winning restaurant
5
We just love this place, a trip to Singapore isn't complete without eating here. Located upstairs at Marina Bay Sands it's always busy and I would recommend booking a week out especially for Friday/Saturday nights. Great food, extensive wine list and friendly service. It's not cheap but when it comes to fine dining cheap doesn't exist especially in Singapore
2
I went here with my partner and two friends in December and we were all very disappointed. The $30 meal we ordered was actually just a taster and the full meal was double the price, we would not have minded if the food had been nice but it was sadly extremely average. The service was nothing to shout about and after spending $500 we definitely didn't feel well looked after. It's just a gimmick, save your money for somewhere else
5
This place offers unique and special Italian food. I went there with my wife and ordered three appetizers and two pastas. Both of us have the same comments - delicious, unique and authentic. Something that you will not get in your normal Italian Restaurant. We were seated at the bar as they did not have a table for us. The bar tender is very friendly and best of all not "pushy". Surprisingly, the prices of the food here are not as steep as compared to other restaurants in Marina Bay. I will definitely want to visit it again and try other dishes
5
If you'd like to savor some authentic Italian food in Singapore the Mozza is definitely a go-to place. I tried the prosciutto and mozzarella for starter and the prosciutto and rucola pizza as main and did not regret it. It tasted awesome and I could have eaten more of it. Service was good and friendly as well even though it was super busy when I went there. All in all, Mozza is a safe bet for all admirers of Italian food
5
The menu didn't look appealing at the first look but it ended up that all the choices were perfect specially the calamari and the beef
5
I really enjoyed this classic Batali style resto. Easy clean menu all delicious. Casual atmosphere and not expensive
5
Very attentive staff, without being in your face. Food excellent. Will definitely return to this restaurant when next in Singapore
5
- I liked the appetizers and the food presentation .
- Distinctive decor shop .
- It offers a variety of cocktails .
- Desserts above expected .
- better to book before .
5
This is your best bet for great pizza with the perfect crust - many choices of toppings and all very yummy. Always crowded but gives a lively and vibrant atmosphere. One of my favorites in Asia so far.
5
Had a sit down meal here and it was awesome, the pizzas are amazing, traditional Italian flavours cooked in a huge pizza oven. The service was great and the staff were very polite and friendly. Wasn't expecting much when I walked in but I was amazed at how good it was, really is a hidden gem. The place is a must for any visitor to Singapore
5
We had Tripe and pork belly for entrÃ©e and we were totally impressed by the authenticity and flavours. Not many restaurants outside Italy offer these old recipes. The waiting staffwere courteous knowledgable and professional . We had clams and fettucine which was a bit disappointing because the clams were not cooked fully as they were plump clams and needed maybe 2 more minutes to cook but the maitre d' resolved the issue straight away and offered us ne freshly cooked plates but we were full by that stage and he was kind enough to take the returned plates off our bill and apologise. I had a negroni which was amazing and the complimentary dessert of Panna cotta was AmazingWill definitely come back to this restaurant
4
I have not been here since november 2015. The staff recalled my visit and waiters, manager came to say hello. Food here us excellent but go left on entry: right turn is pizza and packed and noisy. The menu is not large but exciting and dishes well presented. Wines are good quality. Well worth a visit.
5
Went here with business associate and it delivered. amazing to be in a mall and have such a high end restaurant...Had the prosciuto/mozzarella app- it was over the top... yes the price is singaporean (as in everything is expensive here compared to other areas of world). Chose a bottle of red, that was amazing - italian of course. had pasta app (each of us). his a clam linguine- looked amazing- and mine- home made pasta rolls and meat sauce tthat was perfect for red wine. then we each had lamb- that was overly generous, but expensive. but cooked perfect. then 1 chocolate desser
4
The staff really made our experience.We had no idea what we should order or how much and we were guided through the menu very professionally.In the end we couldn't decide between a few dishes and took recommendations from our waiter which were just perfect. I enjoyed each dish a lot, and the wine which was also recommended. Whilst it's a little pricey we enjoyed it and our only complaint is there could have been a little bit more time between each course. Our waiter certainly made this more memorable. So thank you to our Filipino friend and we hope you make it to Auckland one day.

Was there when first opened and happy to report still fantastic! Awesome pizza selection AND great tasting. Best chopped salad in Singaore. Friendly staff, relaxed atmosphere. Good, straight forward Italian food. Will visit EVERY time in Singapore.

We were a table of 8 and ordered a wide variety of starters, all of which were excellent. The cheese stuffed foccacia was stunning, the burrata Pugliese as good as I have had in Puglia. But to me the star was the humble calamari fritti. I only ordered it, because it's the bog standard and I wanted to see how it would be. It was truly outstanding; tender squid, thin, crispy batter and then a light, lemony almost syrupy sauce, lightly enhancing the whole dish. And then the main courses arrived: The tortellini in brodo. Instead of a light, gentle broth, we got a monster of dark, much too deep and almost thickened soup, the tortellini were heavy, completely over salted (and I like a good dose of salt). This is a dish that can normally be served to a recovering consumptive, but this interpretation could have killed a cow. The pork chop was beautifully done, juicy and tender, but then it was covered with a thick layer of herbs and whatnot and sat in a heavy sauce that was completely unnecessary. All the 6 dishes I tasted, including the duck ragu pasta and the overcooked bream suffered the same problem: Too much flavour. The chef needs to realise when it is time to leave well enough alone. There is a point in which any further reduction of flavours becomes counterproductive and our chef last night passed that point and continued running. So we are left with a problem: Starters we will dream about and mains we want to try and forget. P.S.: We were joined by a quite well known French champagne producer and even he was shocked by the enormous markup on even the humblest of wines.

eaten in the Pizza side of the restaurant 3 times now and feel its some of the best Pizza in the world and eaten in Marios restaurants in New York for years and love his food so chose to eat some past here as other friends wanted to eat in Ramseys resturant.The pasta was expensive but worth it.hard to find a bottle of wine under $100.i will return

Had an early dinner and went for a Thursday evening Tasting Menu - Salad: caesar variation with gorgonzola cheese and hazel nuts (crisp, well presented..a great twist on what would have been an otherwise boring salad!)- Cheese: smoked mozzarala with anchovies (top quality mozzarella with a healthy helping of anchovies...a great contrast of flavors- Primi: Gnudi pasta with Truffles (3-4 pieces that were absolutely perfect...one of the best pastas Ive ever had)- Secondi: Iberian Pork (perfectly cooked and delicious)- Desert: Panna Cotta with raspberries (average)Service was excellent - attentive, friendly and knowledgeableWorth a repeat visit next time I am in the area

After dining on Asian feasts, thoroughly enjoying them but needing a contrast preferably with cheese(!) we found Osteria.We waited quite some time for a table, our own fault as we didn't book. Eventually we were seated at the bar which was fab as we had fast access to the bar staff. We found out very quickly that they were very helpful & friendly!We ordered the obligatory olives & bread to devour whilst making the pizza decision! We decided on meatballs to start, it was a shame there wasn't arancini on the menu but the meatballs were so tasty, after a week of spice & Oriental flavourings my tastebuds were very satisfied with the sweet meat & tangy sauce.We drank Pinot Grigio (standard) & shared a simple margarita with a truck load of Parmesan! I always judge an Italian place by their generosity with the Parmesan. Just leave it on my table & Im a happy girl! Due to the bustle of the restaurant it was nice to have the table at the bar & we loved every minute. I can taste that Parmesan even now...

My friend was craving pasta or pizza and we were at MBS, I could only think of this Italian place which I passed before so we went there. Strangely it's the same location but the staff said - pizza is pizza, pasta is pasta. We can't cross order. We actually wanted abit of both. But they said no. We need to make a choice. We chose pizza but it was full so had chose pasta as she was hungry. The ambience and deco in the place is nice, chic, dim. Probably good for a first date impression. But there's no place to put handbags for ladies or place to hang on the chairs. Suppose you can only bring a purse there. The prices are expensive. Appetizers $20 and above. Pastas above $20. Main courses above $40. The menu is all described in Italian. I didn't even know what the food is... Had to ask the waitress to describe what the food is... It's horrible. Can't they have a line of English description about what's in the dish? Can't expect the wait staff to explain the whole menu to the guest, right? It's quite ridiculous. We ordered pasta... OMG the portion is like an appetizer. Like a fistful of pasta. Very little. The taste... The sausage tasted burnt. And pasta very chewy and oily. (Even though they did tell me that particular pasta is the chewy type, it was quite hard and rubbery) After "dinner" of pasta, we were still hungry. My friend commented, the portion size is so small. Yes, perhaps you expected us to order appetizers and main courses plus dessert. But it's really a tiny portion... Yes, there's an option for a large portion.. But the price of the "regular" pasta is already $26+++ should I just be satisfied with the measly portion? No! I expect a proper plate portion of food! Additional price would be for the really hungry!The meal was disappointing. The only savior was the double shot latte we ordered at the end of the meal. $7++ in a small cup but it was fragrant, very thick and creamy. Excellent cup of coffee. If anything, just have coffee... Everything else, forget it.

Having read other "glowing" reviews of the Osteria Mozza I wonder if we actually dined in the same restaurant but am pretty sure we did. We were passing, hungry and wanted a simple meal so we wanted to try the adjoining pizza restaurant, it was busy so we accepted a table at the Osteria instead. The initial "welcome" from our server was positively underwhelming and we wondered if we should leave but decided to persevere as the food looked good; unfortunately things did not improve. Asking questions about the menu is obviously not de rigeur here, likewise declining the offered Prosecco and opting for a craft beer instead. The food which was reassuringly expensive was a tale of 2 halves, mine (Butter Lettuce followed by Iberico Pork) with was nice but not exceptional, sadly the side of Rosemary potatoes tasted and looked like they may have been cooked earlier in the day. The options chosen by my wife (Bufala Mozzarela with Condimenti followed Butternut Squash Mezelune) were not good at all. If trading standards has any meaning her choice from the "Mozarella Bar" should be more correctly renamed as Condimenti with Mozarella, not exactly sure what was in the Mezelune dish as neither of us could detect much of anything apart from gnocchi (possibly) and olive oil. Overall very disappointing, perhaps we dropped in on a bad night but I am afraid anywhere that puts itself up there has to deliver - every night

We just had dinner at Osteria Mozza. One of us ordered the grilled octopus as an appetizer. The octopus was overcooked and BURNT! It was so rubbery that it would have bounced back if I had thrown it against the wall. It was so burnt that it tasted bitter. Charred has a subtle smokey charcoal taste whereas burnt food is carbonized and will obviously taste bitter.I spoke to the waitress and pointed out that the octopus was over grilled and burnt. Instead of apologizing she said I am supposed to eat it with the salad so that it will not taste bitter. Indeed it was so bitter that I had finished the salad before the last 2 pieces of the octopus. I have eaten at all the so called celebrity restaurants in Singapore and I have yet to encounter such food and such bad service in a high end restaurant. Diners should be warned that they should like bitter charred octopus if they wish to dine at Osteria MozzaAnd don't give any negative feedback or you will be accused of not knowing how to eat 'good' cuisin

Loved everything about it! Prices are fairly high, but we definately thought It was worth it. We had the bruschetta to start with. Can highly recommend it! The oxtail ragÃº for main. Got goosebumps to this dish.Lastly we had coffee and some sort of terrific lemon cake. Service was excellent throughout the entire dinner

We visited Mozza twice this visit to Singapore. The food was amazing and didn't disappoint. The smoked buffalo mozzarella is delicious but they don't always have it. Nothing beats finishing the meal with the Bomboloni (little Italian donuts) Yum!!! I took off 1 star because the service was a little disappointing this time, as we visit every year when we are in Singapore. But overall it was an amazing meal and we will be back :
5
We had the tasting menu, and it was fantastic. The servers were excellent, very knowledgeable about the dishes, and helpful working around some dietary restrictions.
This place also has excellent cocktails.
4
Singapore is notoriously overpriced especially when it comes to fancy names and locations. This is one such instance. In my opinion worth at least 1 try, with the wine pairing. Pecorino wine with cheese was ingenious. The barbaresco was well paired too.
4
Great service by the team. They genuinely tried to understand your needs and then suggested few items for you. Also told chef to tweak some of their items.
4
We ordered several antipastos and pizzas and they were all really good! The restaurant has a warm and rustic feel with a great energy. We went for dinner and the place was packed, so make a reservation.
4
We went to this restaurant because it was recommended by a friend. The restaurant has a lot of friendly staff who greeted us, brought us to our table, and occasionally asked us if our food was ok. We ordered asparagus for dessert, gnocchi pasta and beef with veggies as mains, and red wine. The food was excellent. I would have given this restaurant 5 points for the quality of food and type of service, but the price was very high and the bill was quite a shock.
4
Booked in late, but they had a table for us at 9pm.Arrived early but they had a seat for us at the bar.Wine list is extensive - but hard to navigate. Ask for help from the bar staff. Pricey for a glass, but that's Singapore for you.The focaccia is to die for. Ordered the smoke mozzarella and Parma ham plate which I will always long for....best mozzarella!!Mains we ordered duck ragu and the spicy sausage pasta - both stunning.Free bread service, wonderful service. Highly recommend. Bar staff a delight, especially when then dance while making cocktails!

I've been in other Mario Batali restaurants and the Osteria Mozza follows the same high standards of service and quality. The size of the portions are based on the assumption that you will order the antipasti, pasta and main course. So, depending how hungry you are, if you just order a pasta for example, maybe you won't be satisfied. The grilled octopus antipasti is delicious. I ordered the pasta with oxtail ragu and my wife the pasta with duck ragu and both dishes were great! The desserts didn't impress me much.The prices are affordable and the service was good. Definitely worth a visit

The pizza was good here. Some of the thinnest crust I have ever had on a pizza. They are individually made fresh to order so it takes awhile to get the food once you order. You can custom order within some of their parameters, meaning you can't change one of their specialty pizzas by adding or taking something off, but you can add to a basic pizza to create what you want. Overall the food was quite good. The service on the other hand annoyed me. One Person Took your order, another got Your drinks, Another came with water, someone else gave you a napkin. People were constantly at the table coming and going. And as soon as you were done with one thing, someone should come take it away. In fact, I was still eating (last one to finish) and as I was eating they started to clear my plates and take. my utensils away

I took the family to the wonderful Cirque Eloize show at the Sands theatre at MBS. It was a lovely start to the evening and my family and I really enjoyed the show. Following the show, we were all hungry we decided to go to Osteria Mozza for dinner. While not having a reservation for 5 people at 8pm on a Sunday night can be a problem we were able to get a table even though the restaurant was quite full.The food was a little disappointing though while tasty, portions were expensive and very small.Don't go here if hungry and having a budget in mind. We enjoyed the burrato with bacon and also the cappresse style as well and 3 different pastas which were all delicious. Anyway probably won't go back

Let's start with the good stuff.....the restaurant looks great. We ate on the Osteria side of the restaurant which has a large black marble bar in the centre which you can eat at. The other half of the restaurant is a pizzeria which is much more informal, no table clothes etc and the tables much closer together.The wine list is excellent and we had a bottle of Barolo which was amazing. The waiters were very knowledgeable about all the dishes on the menu and were able to offer good recommendations. My main course pasta dish and pudding were both delicious.Now the not so good.....When we arrived our table wasn't ready so we were asked to take a seat at the bar and have a drink there while we waited. This would have been absolutely fine but it took so long for someone to come and take our drinks order that we were shown to our table before our drinks arrived at the bar.I chose a starter from the mozzarella bar which was burrata served with prosciutto. What actually arrived though was a plate of prosciutto with a disproportionately small amount of cheese in the middle. While both ingredients were tasty they hadn't been dressed with any oil etc so were a little dry.The whole atmosphere in the restaurant is quite stiff. While the waiters are very knowledgable the service is way too formal and it makes it feel as though the restaurant is trying to be something it isn't. Although the food is good, we're not talking Michelin quality here and I've had more affable service at 3 star Michelin restaurants. My husband wanted to order a pizza for his main course but we were told this wasn't possible as we weren't sitting in the pizzeria side of the restaurant. It's just all a little too pretentious without the food standards to match. On the whole we enjoyed the food and had a nice evening but the restaurant needs to take itself less seriously or really up its game and be the uber fine dining experience it aspires too
4
delicious food and good cocktails. no complaints of the service. you got what you paid for. definitely will be back again!
4
My third time here. Pizzas are absolutely scrumptious. The Mozza Caprese is my favourite starter dish hands down. For dessert make sure you try the gelato. Out of this world. Service is excellent as well.
4
Comfortable atmosphere, good service, tasty food. The prices were fair, given the location in an upper end shopping location. The pizzas are tasty, and on the large size for one person.
5
Excellent ambience! Great italian food ! In the same restaurant left side tables are for people to eat pasta and right side for pizza s ! Food is great ! For vegetarians not much in the menu ! Staff is ex cellent !
4
Good Italian food, liked the antipasti selection, burrata and shared lamb chops. Great wine selection too! Don't miss desserts
3
Forgot our starter. Pizza was very average at best. Best thing was the IPA larger which I enjoyed even though it works out to £10 a pint but that's about the same across Singapore.

This classic Italian Restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands shopping Centre has a sensational menu of pasta, and broader Italian dishes. The Mozzarella Bar has a stunning assortment of appetisers, from various Burrata dishes to a simple caprese.If you can imagine the finest, possible Italian food, this is it. Pastas include goat cheese ravioli, tagliatelli with oxtail ragu, and maltagliatu with duck ragu.The pork chop with fennel, onion and samba, as well as whole sea bream with bergs and extra olive oil are highlights.Apple borsellino with caramel gelato & whipped cream fruit provides a stunning, textured finish to a sensational meal.Italian wines compliment each course perfectly.The marble bar is slick and elegant, and is a great place for a couple to enjoy dinner in a relaxed, upmarket, elegant style. You cannot book the bar, so first in, best dressed.
5
Most definitely the culinary highlight of our Singapore trip. We have eaten at Italian restaurants all over the world, and this is without question world-class. My wife had the Ricotta Gnocchi and I had the Agnolotti with Butter and Sage - both excellent. The pasta portions are as expected entree sized.The vanilla pannacotta and the bombolini were wonderful finishes to a great experience. Our waiter was Richard (Riccardo) from the Philippines, who spoke Italian better than I do! His service was superb - polite, friendly and informative. A truly outstanding experience - bravo to Mario Batali and his team at Osteria Mozza Singapore. Ton

My wife and I ate at the Osteria Mozza in January and quite frankly I cannot recommend it highly enough. We did not have a reservation, and even though it was packed, with a minimum of fuss they found us a table. The service was impeccable, attentive but not pushy. Very knowledgable staff provided helpful advice on both the food and the wine. When the food arrived it was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious. My wife and I are well travelled and real foodies and this was a real treat.I always end my reviews advising on whether I would recommend the venue. On this occasion, I cannot recommend the Osteria Mozza highly enough. This is top of our list for when we are next in Singapore. Just fab. Enjoy.Prof Lester Lloyd-ReasonCambridge, U

Have dined at the Pizza side of this eating establishment but decided to go next door to Osteria mozza and was blown away by their Spaghetti alla Carbonara - reminded me of the past but this dish was so beautifully flavoursome - delighted! Service was also excellent
5
We decided last night to visit Osteria Mozza without booking! The staff sat us comfortable at the bar and we managed to enjoy the fabulous food again! We have our old time favourites, but they do change the menu a little every few months :-).
3
I had the tagliatelle with beef ragu and really enjoyed the dish. But for the price and portion, not worth it. would only try again if I really crave Italian. Service and staff were good.
4
It still surprises me that it is a celebrity restaurant. Pizzas are very nice, but even my kids say that they are not amazing. Still, it is a very good option for a fine pizza. Do try the Antipasti options.
5
First time eating here. Frequented the Pizzeria part of the restaurant, rather than the semi fine dining part. The pizzeria is relaxed but with a nice ambiance and atmosphere.Very warm greeting on arrival. Polite and helpful. The wait staff were probably the most attentive I've experienced in Singapore. Continuously checking that I and my friends were OK, if we needed anything else, replenishing glasses of fresh water on the table.In particular, one of the guys on the floor - a Korean by the name of Minh - was refreshingly helpful and patient. To the point that when we remarked on one item being less than well prepared (a pizza that had too much oil on the base and was not as delicious as had been anticipated), without question or challenge (which is often the approach I've experienced in other restaurants in Singapore) it was replaced at no charge. And quickly too.Aside from the minor glitch with food quality stated above, both the replacement pizza and everything else that was ordered was delicious.And with the service excellence that we experienced, the overall experience was very positive. I'd say that this place is well worth a visit
5
It's a big call to label your favourite home town restaurant but after much consideration, this one is it. Great food, world standard service with a casual approach, an excellent wine selection, helpful sommelier, great atmosphere (especially for a restaurant that is based in, well let's face it, a shopping mall (albeit an upmarket one).Good for couples, groups, business or just great dinner with good friends. Book in advance.Oh, and my favourite restaurant in the world? I think I'd have to say Guy Savoy in Paris but I promise I'll keep searching
5
We were craving for something familiar and decided on getting some pizza. Since it was a Mario Batali restaurant, I expected really good food. Pros:-Great anchovie salad-Good pizzaCons:-Slow wait staff-Waiters knew nothing about wine/drinks. Drink selections were limited. Final Thoughts: I wouldn't go back. Nothing spectacula
3
I sat at the bar and was ignored the entire meal. It took 30 minutes for my appetizer of meatballs to come out. They were very good, and they should have been at that price. 45 minutes later, I got my pizza. It was good, nothing special - I've had plenty better.Was it a busy lunch? Yes. But at these prices and with the owner's reputations you would expect for them to be ready for prime time. They were not
5
If you're looking for great Italian food in Singapore look no further than Osteria Mozza. Mario Batali's outlet in Marina Bay Sands is proving a hit. The service is really good and the food even better. Try their mussels in tomato soup for appetizer and their pastas are all really good. For main course you can't go wrong with either the steak or pork chop. Satisfaction guarantee
3
The interior is nice and they let us enter before the booking. My friends got a set menu. Nice food but very little portion and very strange fact I didn't take set menu but I eaten more and pay less. Don't go during festivity time they are very slow
1
We came at 9.30 and by the 11.20 we still didn't get all set menu,2 hours of waiting for ridiculous small potions and ridiculous crazy price for one person set menu was 230$ non alcohol included and long waiting time, we almost got late to the party and had to skip our dessert, horrible service for the restaurant which trying to compete with other better restaurants around
5
We had dinner with friends last 18th Dec and was seated at the bar. The bartender Lye(?) was very friendly and attentive. The mussels was so good and tasty! The restaurant look a little too dark but still comfortable.
5
5 Star Resturant with a five star price! Example Rib Eye for two=SD248.00, Linguine w/clams = SD29.00 all ala cart!! Great service, staff very pleasant .
5
great food, lovely atmosphere, shame it's in a mall (but you don't feel it once inside), friendly staff
5
Mozza is my go-to place whenever I drop by MBS. The food is awesome, cocktails are great, and the desserts menu never fail to impress. The service is excellent - I always enjoy my dining experience there.
5
Went there with my family for an early dinner. Oh wow!! One of the best meals of my life. I had a pasta called something roots with truffles... The portion was a little on the small side but maybe it's because It was so delicious I could have eaten 2 of them. My kids had the chops. Too delicious for words. Both recommended!! Even my kids commented how amazing their food was. The prices are not for a family meal as they are very high but it is family friendly. Wish I could go back
4
When we came in without reservation, we had to wait for maybe 15-20 minutes as they set up the table, despite we can see a few tables were empty, but they were probably reserved. We were then seated and our waitress offered us the wine menu, which was quite impressive. We decided on a prosecco. After we ordered, our waitress put a napkin on my friend's lap, which was always a good gesture for a fine-dining place. Soon enough came a complimentary appetizer, which was good (buttermilk cracker with ricotta). And another waiter came to offer us bread, the focaccia was delicious, though he didn't offer olive oil or vinegar.I tried a buratta with grilled asparagus for appetizer. And this was the best dish of the night. The burrata was just deliciously creamy without being overwhelming; the asparagus was grilled to perfection while the ground nuts, chopped almonds, rock salt, browned butter and olive oil added a nice texture and flavour to the whole dish. The bacon was thin and crispy with a hint of lemon butter, which was a very nice surprise.The maltagliati with duck ragu's portion was surprisingly small, even if it was delicious. The duck ragu was tender and flavourful, complimenting the thin maltagliati -while slightly over al dente, it didn't detract from the overall taste of the dish. The Linguine with clams, pancetta & spicy chilies seemed to have a bigger portion. The linguine with its herb infused white-wine sauce was nicely al dente, though it was hard to detect the white-wine infusion. The pancetta, on the other hand, retained the white-wine infusion very well. The waitress also told us that the Linguine would be slightly salty because it's cooked al dente, which wasn't quite right as it's salty because of the pancetta. The Rosemary Olive Oil Cakes with olive oil gelato & rosemary brittle was beautifully arranged. Also, another small portion. The gelato didn't taste much like olive oil, but it seemed to be a vanilla gelato drizzled with olive oil. The olive oil and rock-salt decoration actually gave the dessert a nice jolt of flavour, especially when paired with the gelato and the sweet caramel brittle with a faint hint of rosemary. Overall it was a satisfying meal with prompt service and great ambiance.Cheer

Great pizzas ... My fav would be the 4-meat pizza. Go ask for it as I can't recall the name. It's an all pork pizza ... the staff would know. Btw, the staff within Mozza are all super confident and competent. Do try also their desserts. The salted caramel thingy, with the marshmellow sauce and peanuts is something to die for. Enjoy 
5
Food was great here. Service was great too, though we sat at the bar b/c we didn't have reservations. It's a very loud place, with loud music in the background, so be prepared. Wine by the glass options seemed limited, but other than that, great experience
5
Del Posto and Lupa have always been my favorites and must go in NYC when I visit, but I never knew Osteria Mozza, or the three, are all owned by the same team until I mentioned to the staff it reminded me of the two in New York.I entered the restaurant with low expectation and great skepticism because of the Caucasian hostess being unfriendly. The food and bartender (Lyle), however pleasantly surprised and rescued the whole experience! The tagliatelle oxtail reminded me of New York first and once I knew it came from the same group, I ordered my second favorite, bavette cacio e pepe (simple pasta with butter and cheese). Yes I had two pasta, and I was completely satisfied!No doubt I'll be returning regularly for my Italian fix
1
Has been to Osteria Mozza twice during November and the 3rd time on 4th Dec.For such an 'high level' and very pricey restaurant you should expect that the chef is really good and that service is at least amazing!!the first two times we had only some plain mozzarella and pasta dishes without sauce (we request just boiled pasta and we add some little oil and parmigiano) and was more or less ok.......except that parma ham was very salty (very very strange for a parma ham that is supposed to be one of the sweetest in Italy!) and service not really attentive; on 4th Dec we decided to go for a focaccia di recco and a caprese..........attached pictures are talking by themselves.......focaccia di recco that probably should change name to read focaccia burned and tomato / mozzarella that was swimming in oil.We had also two pasta dishes where the pasta itself was definitely good and rightly cooked but the two sauces were really a crap! Not happy enough we have decided to get also one torta della nonna that unfortunately was an other bad experience.then, the only good things of the evening was a good bottle of barbaresco.....something that they didn't touch in the kitchen :-)Service was crap at least as the food if not worse: they didn't bring us any piece of bread and whilst we were having our pasta they ask if we want some more!!! hahahah; they decide to leave the wine bottle on different table but unfortunately they were forgetting to serve us............until I asked them to leave the bottle on our table.Do believe that for a bill of 350 dollars you would expect much better food and a great service.Overall, this restaurant is on the level of a very very cheap Italian trattoria in Italy but so pretentious to have prices of a 3 star Michelin.Even in Singapore there are several other Italian restaurants where food and service are much better than this terrible overrated Osteria Mozza.Giuseppe Marr

We always come here when in Singapore looking forward to the best Italian I know worldwide. All dishes absolutely delicious. Only drawbacks: it's very pricey (but worth it), a little noisy and hard to get a table. Reserve in advance.

Arrived having high expectations for this place. Started with the wine selection which was exceptional about 20 pages large but unless you know the regionals this is pointless, the staff were good but I think they read the labels rather than tasted the wines themselves. The sell for a 250 dollar bottle for an Australia wine I can but at home for $20 selling for $150sg wasn't very good. I ordered the tortorlelli pasta what a disappointment I counted 10 pasta shells in a veal broth. I worked 8 years in a Italian restaurant to have an opinion and frankly it has average. The waiter was very accommodating and ordered the ravioli with goat cheese which was a nice save but I was still left wondering what the chef's thoughts were. If your charging $35 AUD for a main serve of pasta which I think should = me leave with a good feed rather than me going go wow what was that! I thinking what could of been, and the music selection was questionable too. Overall a restaurant with loads of potential but didn't hit the mark due to things that can be improved and made to better the business
5
I had passed this restaurant many times but decided to try it. What a good decision. The staff were efficient and courteous: the menu attractive: the wines excellent (a bit more expensive than some places) and a very fine lunch experience.But beware: the restaurant is in two distinct parts: fine dining to the left; pizzeria to the right. When I arrived at noon opening time MANY queuing for the Pizzeria were being turned away because they had no bookin

We dined at Osteria Mozza on the recommendation of the chef of another restaurant in Singapore.I'm not going to bother writing about the food as it was nice enough and nothing to complain about, however the serving size was severely lacking. I was hungry when I came in and after eating my 'meal' was not even nearly satisfied and ended up going out to buy dinner to fill me up afterwards. Incredibly disappointing.
3
We were transiting to Hong Kong via Singapore and took the opportunity to try Osteria Mozza.Service was courteous but could be a bit more attentive. Foodwise, the Burrata was good but not exceptional. I suppose we were spoiled by the quality of food on our trip to Italy 2 years ago. But I would expect that the restaurant can source its produces from wherever it wants so to me, that wouldn't be a valid excuse. Also, the portion of cheese was way too small as to make it impossible to have enough burrata to match each bite of asparagus.The Seabream was bland and completely overpowered by the herbs. Pasta was good and fresh, although nothing that cannot be had at any middle-of-the-road Italian restaurant. All the dishes were uni-dimensional and lacked that layering of flavors which differentiates high-end from middle of the road restaurants (and chefs). Not that the food was bad in any way; you will have a good meal at Osteria Mozza, just not a Michelin star worthy one (although you will pay at that price-point).dbBistro which is next door to Osteria Mozza offers a superior dining experience and, for us, ended-up costing us les
5
This restaurant is very modern and very clean. This restaurant is in The Marina Bay Sands Mall. the mall is very elegant as well as this restaurant. We ordered the bolognese, and it was un believably good. I think it is the best bolognese i have ever had. This restaurant is expensive but worth every bit
3
I've heard good things about this place, and that might have probably set my expectations too high? The food here is OK, and nothing mind blowing. The ambience and service is not bad. I can easily name many more places that serve better Italian food, with nicer ambience, at a lower price.
4
The pasta was excellent. You don't need to go to Italy. What a delightful experience. It is in a mall , I would say that is the only negative, so the light is not natural and the feel is of mall, but you are in a great restaurant. The staff is very friendly with a sommelier that takes himself too seriously, but who cares. Still the food which is what is important in my view is excellent. Congrats..
5
It's italian dinner last week. The food was great and served with very well mannered staffs.They offered complimentary bread with 3 different types, also a small plate of crackers with delicious topping.Decoration was basic, but I think people were there for food or drinks.Beware for high heels, the wooden floor could be a bit slippery if walking in a rush.Worth to be recommended, but will try the Pizzaria at its right side in the next visit
5
a celebrity chef restaurant well worth the visit. its situated in the marina mall. its divided into two spaces, the casual pizzeria and the fine dining scection. we ate at Osteria.The interiors are old world classy and comfortable. Music i felt was not suitable to the restaurant. We started of with a pizza like focaccia which was excellent, crunchy cheese on the top soft inside, loved this dish. sea salt flavoring catapulted this started to whole new level. Absolutely fantastic !Burrata was very nicely prepared. However the softness of the mozzarella with perfectly done asparagus did not go that well. I mean they have a lot of variety of burrata's in the menu. Something which wife an I didn have a palate for. A friend accompanied us and it was his 4 th time there. he obviously was in love with these. Basically something to do with our palate not the dish.Main course was orecchiete and maltigliati, meaning there exquisitely prepared pastas with fennel sausage and duck ragu respectively. I literally do not have the vocab to describe the flavours i experienced with both the pastas. once has to be there sipping their wines and taking a bite of these delectable pastas. BEST I have ever had. Will definitely be a permanent option whenever in singapore

Like every BB restaurant it lived up to the expectations.
The pasta was amazing!!!
Had the celery root capellacci and it was incredible. The octopus was fresh and yummy, too.
The wine list was a little pricey (90spd the least expensive).
Great dinner.

Not bad but over rated for the price I am paying . Nice setting and fresh food . Van be crowded so need to book in advance

good restaurant, but very crowded and service was slow. The location is bad, and it was not clean. the prices were too high
4
we were two couples wanting to catch up after several years apart, and the restaurant was the ideal place for thistables were well spaced out, and the food was really very good - the pasta as well as the sea bass stood outportions were generousbut we tired of the waitstaff persistently filling up our water glasses and bringing out fresh bottles of Pellegrino without being asked - it felt like a rather cheap and tacky sca

I have visited a number of times for lunch and dinner. It is consistently excellent. The food is always spot on, from the large sized single ricotta ravioli with melted brown butter (S$25) to the impressive portion crispy pork belly (S$30). The wine list is endless and the staff are friendly and helpful.It is not cheap but manageable if you avoid Singapore priced alcohol.The interior is well done, open feel without windows separating you from the inside of the mall where you enter and a great bar where you can also eat from.It's a great spot for pre or post theatre.You must visit this place if in Singapore

This restaurant is always busy, so it best to make a reservation to prevent disappointment. We have been coming here once or twice a year since they opened. The food has been consistently good, the ambience pleasant, but the tables are very close to one another, the service sometimes below expectation. Our all time favorite is the pizza- the dough is different from most pizzas, the toppings are always fresh. In fact, the quality of the food gives the impression that the ingredients are fresh. The reason I deduct 1 star is because of the less than expected service from the receptionists and sometimes, servers

Visited for a mid week dinner -anticipating a pricey but high quality pasta meal (that was the previous experience here). All fine with the front desk, attentive, professional service from the staff ... Then it all went downhill ....... Entree - poor quality ingredients....well presented. Pasta main .... Pathetic presentation for a restaurant of these prices - and simply badly cooked - inexcusable for an Italian restaurant to over/under cook pasta (chewy) - and as for the presentation on the plate - single slop from a ladle would be best way to describe. With soo many consistent, quality dining options in MBS - no need or desire to go back again .
5
We went with family for dinner. It was meant to be a special dinner and the menu did not disappoint us. The staff was condiderate gibing alternate suggestions to suit the palette. Pricey but eorth the money. The dishes had atinge of unusual glavour reflecting the preference of Chef for lemony tangs.
5
Make sure you go there with a group of friends, so you can share appetizers and side dishes to accompany your pasta or main dish. The pasta is delicious and cooked al dente. My wife and I ordered some orecchini and tagliatelle verde and we were not disappointed. The polenta, figs with bacon and mixed salad complemented well the pasta. The restaurant has a nice bar and the atmosphere is fantastic
2
Too expensive for over-thought food. The beauty of Italian food is its simplicity, highlighting the flavours of the produce. The burrata caprese was not burrata. It was half a piece of mozzarella. And the spaghetti vongole was lost in chunks of xhorizo like pancetta - swamped any subtle seafood flavours. Bench seating was uncomfortable and all the ambience of a shopping centre KFC. Service was quite good and olive oil and rosemary gelato was excellent. Wouldnt go back or recommend to a friend
4
Good food but too costly for what you get. Great ambiance though but service was sub par for this type of restaurant. Wine selection was very good.
5
The pasta dish we had with the fennel sausage was amazing. Would definitely recommend. Only complain is the wine list is a bit intimidating and not many options less then $150.00
2
We had two pizzas and a beer. Waited almost one hour before getting our pizza and 10 min after handing in our Credit Card. The food was OK.
5
Recently, my wife and I had dinner at Mozza. The food and service were impeccable. We keep coming back because the GM is kind and capable. Mozza is hands down the best restaurant in MBSSingapore, largely due to Owen and his staff.
5
Great food, great wine - We shared different dishes with our party so we could taste as much of the menu, as many things looked really delicious. All in all, not cheap, but worth it.
4
A pizza dining from USA... a bit luxury place for casual food like pizza. I like it since it's not too gorgeous but enough to make your lunch / supper apart from daily ones. Foods are decent, service is good, price is not bad compare to other "celeb chef" restaurants in MBS... Would like to go back sometimes
3
There is only one problem with this place! If you are visiting for the first time and do not eat pork, be advised and double check before you place your order. After trying to order numerous dishes I grew tired of asking. The menu does not give much detail. For example, the lamb pasta dish I was surprised to learn has anchovies in it. Again no where in the menu! So assume that everything has pork in it somewhere and double check.Apart from that, the food is good, the cocktail menu fine and the deserts very good. Not as good as the Pizzeria just next door but good all the same. Service good. Clean.One final gripe, why the heavy metal music on the stereo? Totally inappropriate for the setting. Maybe it was a means to get people in and out as quickly as possible!
2
While the food was just okay, what made the experience poor is the service. From starters to making payment, we kept having to remind the servers a couple of times for our drinks, dips, even credit card! It was also quite difficult to understand some of the servers who wanted to explain the dishes as their local dialect was quite thick
4
This is a very good Italian restaurant with all the usual specialties, great to have really good pasta having been mainly on a rice diet.On a quiet floor above the hustle and bustle with good service and a very good ambiance. Very good diner for couples
3
Degustation menu $228 per person ++ . We were 2Appetizers Grilled Octopus tasty well cooked ( not to die for)Salad (just ok)Two Cheese ( bite size ) very goodRavioli with ricotta very goodPasta with duck ( not great)Here is were comes the mayor disappointment in the entrees Iberico Pork Chop - we have been lucky enough to have eaten the most spectacular iberico pork in a little town in Spain to die for, when I saw they had Iberico Pork in the degustation Menu we went for it with a very big disappointment to find a dry over cooked meat filled with tendons and tasteless My husbands entree the Fish was over cooked topped with over cooked lentils .We ended up with a bill of $500 for two and very unhapp
5
The service is amazingg the food is amazing i loved the ambiance and the food the people was super friendlyy I'm definitely going back for more
4
I enjoyed the atmosphere in this restaurant especially the music that they played. I had Grilled Figs for starter and Bucatini all Amatriciana which is both amazing.
Will come back for more!
5
The food taste & quality is superb.
Try the lime mocktail ;)
Atmosphere is good for chatting with friends (lively music & not romantic)
5
Good welcome, excellent atmosphere and interior, good food (I'd recommend italian affettati with gnocco fritto). I loved it...we came twice in one day!!! it's defenetely one of the best restaurant I have been in Asia. Level of service is high and attentive. Next time in Singapore, I will come back
4
This is the best Italian food that I have ever tasted but it is also the most expensive! The portions were also small, which was not a problem for me as I do not have a huge appetite but I did feel a little short changed and for this reason alone I would not return. If you like expensive quality over quantity and enjoy Italian food then you will enjoy this experience. The service of course was excellent, as is standard in Singapore
5
the food is really good the thin crust pizza is just yummy & the pasta we ordered just melts in your mouth - the best I have ever tasted but it is pretty expensive if you order wine along with your meal & the marina parking is just too expensive - we paid $ 14 just for bout 2 hours so that's stops us from going very often  their mozarealla cheese is the best ever 
1
I came to Mozza Osteria with a group of friends. It was a pleasant impression good welcome, good interior and very good food. However had a horrible experience after as I was so disgusted by the way the General Manager repeatedly announced that he was the "General manager" and his name is Owen and he reeks of alcohol while he was helping himself constantly to the alcohol behind the bar! Not sure if it is acceptable in FnB to drink during work hours but i know reeking of it is revolting! He was saying such inappropriate things in front of my guest. How professional! Will never come back until they change their management! Not sure how the management allow such a horrible leader to run a place so classy like Osteria. Such bad example
4
We have eaten at the Mozza Pizzeria next door several times and the food was delicious. For a special occasion we finally decided to try Osteria Mozza. We were not disappointed with the food. There were 4 of us. We had 2 appetizers (Mozzarella Taster and Mussels). We asked the waitress if the order of mussels would be enough for 4 people to share and she said there would be about 12 mussels, but there were definitely more than that. We each had our own plate of pasta (Lamb Ragu, Suck Ragu and Clams) - all delicious! We ordered a Wagyu Steak to share. The steak was one of the best we've ever had. 3 of us had 1 cocktail each and one of us had 2 glasses of wine. We had 1 bottle of mineral water. We were too full for dessert. The bill came to about SGD 400 (this was after our 10% Citibank discount). I would say the service was a tiny bit disappointing. The waiters walk around and serve you 1 piece of bread at a time, and no olive oil or vinegar was served. Normally we do not order bottled mineral or sparkling water as tap water is safe to drink in Singapore and it is free, but we were only offered mineral/sparkling water. We saw other patrons who have probably been before just ordering plain tap water free of charge. I did not feel that the waiters/waitresses were that friendly, but that's not something surprising for Singapore. They also seem to have a hugely stocked bar, but were unable to make us a Mojito and only had a small cocktail list of about 6-7 cocktails. Their wine list is extensive, but the waiters/waitresses did not seem to know much about the wines and could not give us good recommendations. Also note that the website says that dress code is Business Casual so we all came nicely dressed, but once we were there, most other guests were wearing shorts, t-shirts and flip flops, so guess dress code does not really matter. Overall, we would probably eat here again, but it is a once in while place and for special occasions
5
Was this the greatest meal I have ever eaten? Likely not, but I do not remember any that were better. Starting from when our waiter Mike came to the table the night was magic with exceptional food and service.We started with the mussels and caprese salad. My wife was a bit hesitant to order the caprese for fear it would be boring. Nothing could be further from the truth. How caprese can be exciting, I have no idea. But it was! Tomatoes were sweet and tasted like perfectly ripe tomatoes. The mozzarella was soft and ever so fresh. Never before had we had such a salad that we savored every bit. The mussels were even better. The only thing missing was a straw to make sure we did not waste any of the juice. But a big spoon worked just as well.I had the Orecchiette with fennel sausage. The pasta was perfect and the sausage itself was amazing. I could have eaten another plate full. My wife had the Maltagliati with Duck Ragu and she totally cleaned her plate. For dessert we had the cannoli which were a fantastic finish to the meal.Oh, and the wine that was recommended to us was also perfect.Expensive? Maybe a little but really in range of any fantastic restaurant.Thank you to the entire staff that took care of us and the great chefs that cooked our food. We will be back!!!
5
Had dinner again at Mozza and as always - a great experience. All the pasta dishes are fantastic. The pork chop was great with a nice pepper crust. All the portions are generous and great for sharing. I generally dislike marina bay sands but Mozza keeps me coming back for dinners. Service was good and attentive.Prices are expensive but well worth it.
5
Really nice place if you want some good Italian style cuisine. I wouldn't say it's authentic Italian but it's Italian style that is tasty. The service is also good (which is hard to find in Singapore).
5
Great Italian restaurant. Their wine list is made out of prime wines that go really well with the extraordinary quality of the food. It is pricey, but well worth it. My favorite place in Singapore.
5
We went for dinner there and we didn't regret it. The food was really tasty and i think it deserves to be at the top50 best restaurants in Asia. Whatever we tried was very good and although we stayed in Singapore for 3 nights we decided to go there one more time, but this time to try the pizzeria Mozza, which was also very goo
3
Whilst we ordered some Pizza's with some Arrancini, these didn't come any where near the $40/pizza excellence one would expect. The pizza base sauce tasted like it came straight out of a bottle/tin can. The Arrancini weren't much better either. However, the staff couldn't have been nicer in the level of service they provided
5
At Mario Batali's (famous american chef) Mozza you can join a beautifull thin and crispy pizza!!It's made right under supervision of the customers, the restaurant has a very good atmosphere, good service, friendly staff, it's a pitty we didn't have time to come back for dinner
4
My family of 4 had a very pleasant dinner. The food was good and we enjoyed the friendly, attentive service too. The price, however, is on the high side. They do have a more reasonably-priced, family portion, which we ordered; enjoyed the paste with clams and all four of us had decent portions from it. So if you are dining for 2 or less then be prepared to fork out a bit more cash than I think you should. Of the other dishes we tried, the Pork Chop is worth highlighting. One of the best in town with a unique marinade, so delicious
5
I had been traveling around Malaysia with my wife and I were at the end of our 4 week trip. We wanted to have a really nice meal after eating at street vendors and local restaurants for far too long.This place hit the spot, the food was to die for and the wine that Sommelier, Han Yew Kong recommended was just right.If your after an amazing night out, with a great restaurant, excellent staff and top food, then this is the place.Next time I go to Singapore I will definitely go back. But this time I will skip lunch, thus more room for dessert
5
One of the best meals I have had. Wonderful drinks (the Singapore Sling is a must have). Everything was very well done. This is a first class eating experience that you should not miss. I was concerned the food would be all hype and no substance and I was luckily proved wrong. I highly recommend.
4
Had a nice pasta, good bottle of wine. Attentive waiters brought bread, suggested the wine to accompany dinner, and refilled our wine glasses. The restaurant was not too busy, but Pizzeria Mozza, just on the other side was quite crowded. Osteria Mozza was a nice alternative
2
For us, every trip to Singapore, it's a must for dinner at Osteria Mozza. Been there many times and loved every mouthful, highly recommended to any friends visiting Singapore. I'm not sure what went wrong this time! Extremely disappointing!! Mediocre food this time, bad music and far too loud.. Felt like we were at a Led Zeppelin show. People at surrounding tables complaining too (and they were the young and trendy set!) The service was mediocre, two of our dishes were over salted (and I love salt!) Sorry Mozza...what has gone wrong. This wasn't the delicious, wonderful experience I'm used to so won't be going back...Not prepared to risk it on my next fleeting trip to Singapore..sad :
5
Busy restaurant with good atmosphere. Quite pricey but good excellent food. The staff were knowledgeable and friendly.
4
Appetizers are so good that you will have to control yourself to avoid being full too early. Share a couple pizzas and leave room for desserts!
4
while visiting Singapore for 3 days 3 weeks ago we had lunch at Pizzeria Mozza in the Marina Sands shopping mall. The place is well decorated, but pricey.
The food was delicious, and we had an excellent waiter.
3
Make a reservation before you go, cos we had to wait for a seat even with a reservation. It's a popular place The food is decent, but didn't blow my socks off. For the price these guys charge, I was expecting something spectacular.Good selection of wines. Helpful staff. Good ambience
5
Hands down some of the best food available in Singapore! Love this place...the fresh Mozzarella and Burrata dishes are to die for. I could just enjoy those with the great wine selection...You have to make reservations or you will not get in and it is open for Dinner only

Like another recent reviewer commented, the positioning of this restaurant is slightly odd as it serves trattoria fare but has the aura of a high-end restaurant. Added to that, there's some element of dissonance when one sits down to a white tablecloth dinner in a darkened restaurant, but just outside is the very visible, bustling, and brightly-lit mall. The service, while highly attentive, is also lacking those little touches that are present at similarly priced restaurants (eg. chair not pushed in, napkins not unfolded, bread crumbs not swept off the table). All that aside, the dishes I tried were generally well-executed. Had the grilled figs to start, a well-balanced dish with quality ingredients, followed by ricotta gnocchi. Partner had the linguine with clams - very fresh meaty clams, though the sauce had much more chili heat than one would expect from an Italian dish (no doubt tweaked to appease local preferences). The selection of pastas is quite impressive with many interesting options. Also had a side of excellent roasted potatoes - crisp skin accented by rosemary and a generous sprinkling of salt, with soft and remarkably sweet potato flesh within. Almond cornette for dessert. Total of $130 for all the above, which is a tad on the pricey side, but I would consider coming back for a special occasion
4
Four of us had an evening meal here during our stay in Singapore. We booked a table in advance as we were aware how busy the restaurants in Marina Bay Sands get of an evening.The atmosphere in the restaurant was great, and was in keeping with the tone of the place. The wait staff were very attentive, explaining things from the menu for us.We all had something from the mozzarella section and a small pasta. All the food was extremely tasty, and we would recommend ordering a dish with burrata in

Our group fo 3 ate at Osteria Mozza in May 2015. Some of the names of their entrees on the Chef's Tasting menu were unfamiliar to us, but the waitstaff were patient and able to explain them in detail to help us deide on them. For the appetizers, we liked their grilled figs (on cheeses) and the Caprese (cherry tomatoes & basil on mozzerella) was fresh and flavourful. Our main courses, Farfalle pasta (with chanterelle, English peas & walnuts) was excellent, the Grilled Pork Chop (with cranberry beans) was ordered well-done and a little dry to my taste and the Roasted Trout (with Umbrian lentils & red cabbage) was decent. For dessert, we had Berry Crespelle (with almonds & vanilla gelato) andPanna Cotta (with cherry compote & biscotii). We weren't big wine drinkers, so we ordered their house red wine instead of paying $100 more for "riserva wine pairing." Overall, we thought it was a lilttle pricey for set dinner (probably justified as it was a popular upscale restaurant at the MBS), but we liked their appetizers and desserts best
2
Have been there some months ago. Its a new spot of Batali and co.Located in Marina bay sands shopping center seems like fine dining restoran but food is more like trattoria. Chefs are singaporean, indian and chinese,so food cant be straight italian. Also very expensive for quality and presentation of food we had.Next time will choose french venue in front.
5
Booked dinner for 2 at Osteria during the Chinese new year period and was not disappointed! The atmosphere of the restaurant is great, as well as the decor and service. Me and my partner chose the pasta tasting menu in which 5 perfectly prepared pastas were served. Each pasta has its own unique taste and variations and were amazing. Those were the best pastas I've ever tried to be honest! The desserts were equally beautiful, just hoped that there was more! Great experience, highly recommended for all. A little on the pricey side but however, it's worth it
5
great ambiance, great food, great service. The waiter was very good at explaining the menu. The food was as explained and taste greatly exceeded our expectations
4
Out of all the choices of "celebrity" restaurants in MBS, we decided to go for Osteria Mozza and was very satisfied. The food was very good but on the expensive side. The menu was half way between English and Italian, making it impossible for me to comprehend, considering my Italian is non-existent. The waiter was very nice and gave me great suggestions, which I ended up ordering and enjoyed but I would prefer to be able to make my own choices without having to google everything. Overall, the service was always prompt and friendly without being overbearing
5
Knowing that this Italian Pizzeria is from Chef Batalli, we just had to try it! And we went back a second time! We had their pizza, salad and the wings and of course Peroni beer to go with it. The place is a bit pricey, compared to Chef Jamie's place in Bali, but then again, everything in Singapore is expensive these days! What's good about this place is that most of their crew are Filipinos and they are very attentive and polite. The front desk lady who I booked for a reservation was also great! Having eaten pizzas in Italy, I can say that it is truly Italian
3
Just average western food, can't say it's authentic Italian. Also can get crowded as many ppl enjoy perks when they go to MBS theatre, then it becomes like fast food... they serve you as fast as they can and want you to leave even faster. So go at time, when performance already started (after 8pm
4
Osteria Mozza is our 2nd choice since CUT was full on that day, Surprisingly the level of service top the restaurant expectation. Great food, we tried the seafood and it was fresh and nicely done. Good seasoning and you can taste the Sicilian style seafood cuisine .The staff were very attentive and helpful. They patiently explain to us the menu and give a couple of good suggestions on the meal. Safe to say we were satisfied with the recommendation. Some would say the price is quite high, but again the restaurant is under Mario Batali. I guess sometime you have to pay more for the brand/quality
4
We enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere. Very nice antipasto: meatballs and heirloom tomatoes. Fried potatoes got a high mark from the wife. The pizza was very good - as good as most I have had in Italy or Australia - but I have had better in both too. Wine was expensive, but pretty heavy "serves".Overall a good experience
4
We decided to try this restaurant. The menu looked very enticing although the prices are outrageously high - $SG26 for 8 pieces of gnocchi was excessive. However, the spaghetti calabrese that I had was excellent. The staff had an arrogant air and were not very helpful. Except when it came to telling you what you had ordered as they delivered it to the table. I know what I ordered and I have a fair idea how it was made, so spare me the lecture.The wine list was incomprehensible and for those who enjoy a glass rather than a bottle - some of us are not heavy drinkers - this is not really the place for you. Singapore's alcohol tarrifs make any drink expensive and Osteria Mozza adds its own tarrif.It would be churlish not to rate this restaurant as very good because it is, but I don't like to feel as though I am being looked down on by the staff. Remember who is paying the bill, guys
5
I prefer a deep pan pizza but in Singapore the norm seems to be thin crust. As such, this was the best pizza I had in Singapore. Very warm atmosphere, I went with a good friend but could imagine going on a date there. The prices were actually ok in my opinion. I was expecting it to be horrendous but it was fine. Maybe thats because we just had a pizza each and one drink rather than starters, desserts and multiple drinks, but i was expecting to pay more for what we ordered.Would definitely go back
4
Two of us popped in for a casual meal. The wine list is extensive and along with food, quite expensive but we expect that in Singapore. Our waiter was determined to get us to order more food or wines, but we resisted, sticking to the lighter meal we had planned, with a glass of wine each. Food was delicious, small portions and it would have been easy to keep ordering more for sure! We shared a Red Endive, Fennel and Parmigiano Reggiano salad, one main of Orecchiette with Fennel Sausage and Swiss Chard, another of Ricotta Gnocchi with Wild Mushrooms and Wild Ramps (onion family), also some Fried potatoes with Rosemary. A glass of sparkling Italian wine was around $25 and a glass of Shiraz around $36. The following evening we dined at the other side of the restaurant, Mozza, slightly cheaper prices and it felt a little friendlier too

Went to Osteria Mozza today for a meal before the Swan Lake Ballet. First of all, I had difficulty understanding the menu as it is obviously meant for people who understood traditional Italian food and being my first time to the restaurant, I did struggle. Played safe and ordered the Buffalo Mozzarella with Prosciutto as a starter. Pretty easy and a safe dish. However Mozzarella was bland and had no distinctive taste. Very very mild. Prosciutto....well its Prosciutto. Cant go wrong with it.So I asked the Bartender what their star Pasta dish was and as I had mentioned I was a meat eater (I realized the antipasti didn't have much meat dishes on it), he recommended a duck ragu and an oxtail dish both of which I was not a fan of . Therefore, i settled for the Orrechiette with fennel sausage which I felt sounded good based upon the bartender's recommendation.What came was a small ear-shaped pasta with a very very strong fennel peppery mixture (sort of like a bolognaise.) with no sausage.Then I realized that the sausage was minced and mixed with the pasta. (Thus the look of the bolognaise).To me, it tasted horrible. The sauce was too strong, but it was bland (I had to really control myself asking for salt) and the pasta was undercooked. I had to push it away and gave it to the bartender and said I didn't like it. He was apologetic and asked me what was wrong and if he could get me something else. I informed him that I expected a meaty dish. I asked for the menu but I realized I had lost my appetite. I should probably have opted for a secondi instead of a pasta right from the beginning but here I was in an Italian restaurant. How often can you go wrong ordering pasta?The chef came to ask what was wrong, and I said I just wanted something more meaty. Again, the previous 2 dishes were recommended (duck and oxtail) to which I politely declined and at that moment, the chef asked what I really wanted. I did inform him I was hoping for an aglio aglio based dish; something al dente. Though he was kind enough to ask if he could create something for me; time was running and I had honestly lost my palate and the appetite as I just didn't understand their menu at all and I declined again and admitted that perhaps I did not have the acquired taste for the menu.What really pissed me off next was when I politely declined and said, I was okay I just perhaps did not have the acquired taste to appreciate such, the chef very loudly said "its not okay, that's what's important to me, That's why I come to work, to make sure my guests are satisfied." While the words were nice, the way they were said and the fact that it was said loudly in front of 2 other couples dining next to me was not okay. Then he asked each of them if they were happy with their dishes and they announced loudly that they were happy which made me feel even more insulted. One of my friend actually felt embarrassed and apologized to the chef. The whole episode made me feel like I was not made to look some idiot who could not appreciate fine food. I do not need to justify the fact that I am a hotelier by profession and that dining in top notch fine dining restaurants including Michelin Star ones on numerous occasion ( Joel Robuchon being my absolute favorite) is a norm for me as and when I like. However, the insult that I felt today in this restaurant which hardly has any international exposure to my knowledge was just not normal. Me not liking the food is not personal; perhaps the menu is something that is not for everyone and I am honest enough to accept that.However, the starter which I ordered had no "wow" factor. Its a simple dish and was executed in a simpleton manner with no flavor. Another simple dish one of my friends had (Corzetti Stampati) was way too salty and she actually agreed with me after I tried it once we got out of the restaurant as she did not want to increase the already tensed situation further.So did we have an enjoyable meal in such an establishment which is to pride itself on its quality of food? NO.To add insult to injury, my pasta dish was charged even after I had returned it and did not order anything else to replace it with. I am not asking for a refund but the gesture should have been automatic at any establishment; more so for a find dining one such as this.Overall; loud on the outside; insipid and bland on the inside. Needs more pride in its stove and less in its participants. After all, mussels sinking in a bowl of tomato sauce is hardly fine dining! Doesn't mean if people do not appreciate your food, that they are imbeciles and if people do; that they are connoisseurs of fine food. Learn to accept some form of criticisms, and if someone does not like your food enough to return it back, have the simple common sense to taste it at the back of your kitchen and ask yourself if it should be fired for service in the first place

i like the benno and potato pizza and the tomatto pure..damn nice,syokkkk ,a bit cramp and crowded..but nice place to enjoy pizza
5
Romantic atmosphere, fresh food. Tasting meal is mostly recommended, especially since chef do care about any food alergic and is willing to adjust accordingly with happy and smile.
Service is professional. Highly recommend.
2
Huge rip-off. The prices on the menu are not clearly explained and horrendously high. The food was fine but not exceptional. The staff doesn't smile. No warmth. Where's the customer experience for that kind of money? I would avoid this place. It's a tourist trap!
5
Osteria Mozza and Pizzeria Mozza may share the same space, each has its own bar. The cocktails at Osteria Mozza are more sophisticated and memorable - try the old-fashioned whisky.
3
Too much of vinegar in the antipasti, pizza centre was too soft and the base was too heavy on flour.
Need to do much better. But as it's always full it reasons that they may not care.
2
As a regular of Pizzeria Mozza, we thought of giving Osteria a try. Our experience was not as expected. Dont get me wrong, the ambiance and the service is great. But the food is highly over priced and the taste a bit too salty for my taste bud. Be prepared to pay $60 for a fill dish of pasta and $27 for the smaller dis
5
Amazing food. Great service. Admittedly, I was in a private room with a VIP visitor but the Chef outdid himself! Did not get a feel for the prices but there was s good selection of Italian food and wines - none of us were disappointed. Strongly recommended, it was much better than Puck

As a previous reviewer wrote, celebrity chefs and restaurants just don't seem to work well. It's like they feel they can rest on their laurels. I'm sure if Mario Batali was there it would be a different story but he's not so it is what it is. 3 of us each had a different burrata and they were very good although 2 of us agreed in that we'd like the bread on the side rather than as an integral part of the dish. Pretty sure the restaurant doesn't make their own cheese though so they don't get points for that.I've come to the conclusion that it's just not worth ordering pasta in a restaurant unless you are in a little family run restaurant in Italy where real Italians eat, otherwise you will just be disappointed with the somewhat soggy and over-cooked plate you are presented with. I had the Corzetti Stampati which was OK. My husband had the Tagliatelle which was OK and our friend had the Carbonara, also just OK, nothing to write home about for anyone.For desert I had an amazing piece of chocolate cake, can't see it on their current online menu so can't give you the name. It was very rich and delicious.We had good service and the sommelier seemed to know his stuff. One thing we did find annoying, and I know that's just how it is in higher-end restaurants, was the use of so many words in the menu that your average person doesn't know. I hate having to Google half the menu.I'm quite surprised that this is number 47 on S.Pellegrino & Acqua Panna's list of the 50 top restaurants in Asia. I've probably had a more satisfying meal at Chomp Chomp in Serangoon Gardens..

We had the bufala mozzarella with prosciutto di parma, Farro with prosciutto & sherry vinegar, goat cheese ravioli, and pan roasted Iberico. It was an excellent, satisfying meal. Everything was tasty and the serving portions were generous.Service was timely and the servers were friendly without being intrusive. They even accommodated our request to split our pasta into two separate servings. Although, there is one server who might have a fake Italian accent - not necessarily a negative. I found it amusing but I don't think it makes the restaurant "more Italian".Overall, it was a great meal in a beautiful location. I would highly recommend this restaurant
5
We decided to stop in for a drink while walking by and ended staying for a bottle of wine, two appetizers and a desert. We had already eaten dinner at home a few hours earlier and despite not being terribly hungry, my wife and I both agreed the food was excellent. We ordered the bruschetta and mussels upon recommendation from the executive chef, David Almany and were glad we did. Presentation was superb, dishes tasty and the service was so far the best we have had during our short time in Singapore (6 months). Prices are high just like most western restaurants here, but the entire dining experience made it well worth it; we even commented to David that the last time we felt this way was at Roy's in Hawaii. All in all, it is obvious the entire staff invests a great amount of attention to detail in everything they do which makes Osteria Mozza such a great place to dine. Everything is top notch and I have no doubt that the sky's the limit for their executive chef

Sat at the counter watching the pizzas being cooked. Have good wine by the glass and service is very good and the place is heaving. Very good pizza with a great crust. Will be back.
5
Unique decor and food quality. The pizzas are delightful and unique. The price are in consequence though.

Osteria Mozza has already made it to the Top 50 restaurants in Asia, so they don't need another review. And it was good that I "waited" 4 years before coming to this restaurant (since they opened at the Marina Bay Sands). At least I know they have managed to maintain their quality all this while.Many see Singapore as a must-go food destination. But more often than not, you would be disappointed by the quality of the service staff - from their lack of knowledge of the menu to poor job training. Because of the labour crunch, many restaurants hire part-time staff who are not properly-trained waiters.But not at Osteria Mozza.The staff from the front desk hostess to the waiters were all very attentive and confident. That always sets a very good start to any restaurant meal.The food is pretty good too. Very robust and rustic flavours are these days seen to be "unfashionable" as new chefs seem to spend more effort striving for those great-to-look-at dishes that don't often taste as good. But here, the food is very much reminiscent of what you'd find in tavernas in small towns in Italy.But beware, the prices are DEFINITELY not anywhere near those in Italian tavernas. More like 3 or 4 times more...But in Singapore, it is rare to find a restaurant that opens beyond 10pm, where the waiters can't wait to go home, and make it known to you by reminding you that the kitchen is closing soon and sometimes even giving you the bill before you have finished eating. So it is with great pleasure to find a place like Osteria Mozza, located just across from the theatres at Marina Bay Sands, for that late night supper after the show.And oh, the food ... it was late, so we didn't order much. Just enough to get a taste of boldness, where the chefs are not hesitant with the flavouring. Almost to the point of overdoing it, as the duck ragu pasta was a bit over-salted, and the sherry vinegar in the farro dish was a tad too sharp. Just a couple of tiny complaints on an otherwise great meal
3
We have been a few times...and only on the less formal, pizzeria side of the restaurant. Good pizza and salad with lovely rosÃ© wine and of course, the bag of bread!Only real problem was the service... The food is good but the service is NOT so the ratio does not work
3
This pizza restaurant prices go beyond the pale. Pizza product is pretty good (except the sausage which was flavorless). But to charge these kind of prices is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure this type of price gouging wouldn't work on East Coast, USA, as you could get far better product at about 1/3 of the price. Been here 4 times in the past three years. No more. I expect for $63, a much better pizza and glass of wine. I feel like it's ok to be fleeced once but no more. The service was smiling and fast. However, it should be for these astronomical prices. And after the service drops off your pizza, how about they ask you if you need any chille flake? And when you finally get their attention to bring you some chille flakes, how about enough to cover a couple of slices? Imagine that, portion control on their chille flakes! Cheers
4
Honestly I did not plan to come to this place, nor did I have an idea what will be on the menu. So I was hesitant at first, but slowly I got comfortable when the staff approached. The waiter probably felt I was new there and no idea at all on what to have, so I was guided and explained of each dish I asked.So, beside the fact that food was good, the service was superb! They even checked on me every time a staff pass by my table.With the perfectly outlined atmosphere and great service to go with it I will definitely come back
5
I came to this place entirely by chance, as I was strolling through the Marina Bay Sands Mall. hardly could I think that I would have ended up with an excellent meal. The ambiance and the place itself are both very nice. The place is divided in two, a pizzeria on the right and a more formal restaurant on the left. I did not boow, we were a party of two, se we settled for the bench, as it looked nice and confortable and we thought we were going to have a quick bite anyway. We were served immediately and courteously. My friend did not like the first wine offered (a nice but strong Barbaresco) and we were immediately offered a second choice (a lighter Sangiovese).We ordered two different types of burrata, one with speck and the other with coppa. Both very good. bu the surprises were the seconds: an incredibly good veal sweetbread, and the best lettuce dish I have ever had. The place is not cheap, as we paid 263$ with two glasses of wine and one bottle of water, and two espressos.But it was so good, I will be back to try more
5
After eating at the pizza side we enjoyed it so much we ate at the pasta side the next night and were not disappointed. Sitting at the counter again gives you great interaction with the staff who are very attentive.Food was amazing with wines to match. Ask about the copper ashtrays (for show only) , a very nice nod to the restaurants Californian owne
5
We ate here before a show at the Sands theater. Wow was it good! The burrata and cacio e Pepe were the best I have had outside of Italy. The staff was very attentive- even the GM came by. Unlike many other restaurants where the manager will ask how the meal is, not register the answer and flit to the next table, this GM asked where we were from, how we liked Singapore and offered to give us suggestions of places to eat local food. Very nice engaging guy- that coupled with fantastic food made for a lovely night! We are definitely going to find more Battali restaurants during our travels!
5
I normally do not like celebrity chefs restaurants but this is excellent!The mozzarella bar is unmisable. The pastas are also very good. Apparently desserts are fantastic, prepared by the very talented Ariana Flores. Next time I will leave room for dessert...The Italian wine list has a very ample selection.The place itself is well decorated keeping in mind that it is inside a shopping mall.The pizzeria Mozza next to it, although I went there almost 2 years ago I remeber as a good nore casual alternative.Ricotta Ravioli * * * * * (special mention!)Mozzarella bar * * * * 
4
The family went to dinner here - same cost as a michelin star restaurant but to be honest the food was comparable too. We had a lovely meal, boys had various pasta dishes, hubby had seafood and I had ravioli. We ended off the lovely meal with delicious panna cotta. Service was great from the male waiters but there was a female waitress who was dreadful - not sure what she was doing there!
3
We didn't expect a bargain & didn't get one - the restaurants atmosphere was busy & upbeat - the service was attentative - I had a pizza - I'm not a great fan of thin crust & this was thin - the topping was stingy & for over $30 I expected better - with a beer near the $20 mark it was overpriced
3
We had company from overseas and wanted to have a special dinner so decided to try Mozza! Ordered the chef special, five dishes in total! Portions were good size, I was stuffed even before dessert! The ambience is great! Cosy, romantic, it is really nice! Had really high expectations but it was average... :
5
This place is always packed. When I visit Singapore, I generally want to eat their local cuisine however this time around, decided to give their pizzas ago and was I glad we did. The pizzas were beautifully cooked and mixed salad was delicious. Service was good and efficient so will definitely be back if staying around MBS again.
5
We had an absolutely delightful meal in this very atmospheric restaurant (some people may replace atmospheric with dark). I had fish which was perfect prepared and presented in an interesting way. Maybe the pan it was served in could have a slightly lower rim to allow for better access to the food and limit the dangers of burning yourself. Aftet our meal we had the great pleasure of meeting talented and charming Executive Chef David Almany, who will go far I'm sure
5
very good selection of wine, also cocktails and mocktails. Every dishes I tried gave satisfaction. The ingredients are fresh and home-made. Tried the pasta with oxtail sauce and lamb which are yummy. But you need to make reservation if you want to come in weekend, otherwise, long hours of wait
4
This restaurant serves up authentic Italian dishes with a reasonable price. The quality of the food is never questionable, and the menu is quite extensive as to satisfy many preferences.I would personally recommend the Uovo Raviolo (one single raviolo with mascarpone cheese & egg yolk filling, with browned butter sage sauce)
3
We had dinner here and everything was ok. We were going to chose between wolfgang by puck (in front of this place) & mazzo. We chose the italian and the was was quite ok. Had better nut much worse as well! The lamb and talgliata are delicious!
5
Always a great meal - easily one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Great food, service and atmosphere. Alot of the produce (cheese, fish, vegetables) is self imported, and you can taste the difference in quality and freshness. Wine list is a tad bit on the expensive side but it is MBS afterall
5
A great restaurant with amazing food. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is really cool, with a hum in the air! Decor is also very nice, dark wood reminds me of a chic bistro in Italy.Had the prosciutto, oxtail ragu and wagu tagliata, with the cauliflower and mint yoghurt side, all were amazing
5
Very delicious, all the main course are very well designed and cooked, defenately worth to go again.
4
This restaurant is overrated and overpriced.The wine prices are so outrageous that all my party drank beer.I know that wine is expensive in Singapore,but compared to other restaurants of similar or higher standard the Mozza wine list is the highest.Food was ok but not special.
4
A little bit too pricey for the Christmas eve dinner, but very unique dishes. Awesome venison, and very unusual sea urchin 1st course. all in all, a good experience but overpriced.
4
This place has great pizza, in particular, they do use fresh mozza cheese which makes this place stand out from all the other pizza places in Singapore. Their salads are also nice and fresh. Great place for coming to dine with friends.
4
What a great little find. The menu is small, but the food is great. Pasta is some of the best I have ever had anywhere in the world. Deserts are again excellent. Whilst sitting at the tables is fine, grabs seat at the bar and enjoy a good chat with the bar keeper whilst you wait for your food.
4
We had a good meal. At a price. Those seeking a more relaxed ambiance than Sky on 57 and Ku dé Ta can safely book a table. Location is far less fancy, it's in the mall (B1), but the food is very good, italian-fusionish, but more italian than fusion. Knowledgeable and courteous staff, less pushy for revenue than at the top attraction restaurants. Still ended with a 300SGD bill for two, with a two dish meal, one glass of wine, one shared dessert and two cups of tea.My lamb chops were excellent, so was my wife's trout. Sides were good too, and quantities reasonably generous.Place fills up fast, and we were turned on for reservations at 7pm "because the only tables for two available were either at 6 or 8pm". Welcome to casino resorts ..
4
I went with my husband during our honeymoon. Very nice restaurant ...Place is very nice, service was excellent. Food was really delicious .. You shouldn't miss ..But I am giving 4 star because I was informed that I couldn't have the plate I ordered (they had ran out of black truffle) and also I couldn't have the desert I ordered (they had ran out of another ingredient). Restaurants with this reputation should never ran out of anything !!!!!!!!
2
Everything about the place was mediocre. From the ambience, to the service, and of course, to the food. The menu seemed appealing, but dont let it fool you, the dishes arent as inspiring as they seem on the menu. For our mains, we shared two pizzas, a apparent “must-try” from the staff. They ended up tasting bland and uninteresting. I can assure you that you would not be able to tell the difference if they were serving this at a pizza joint and here, at Osteria Mozza. The almost cheeseless, mostly crust and sauce pizzas are a cheap excuse for a overly priced ordinary pizza. In my opinion, the food is extremely overpriced for what it is and I would not recommend it. There are plenty of substantially better restaurants at Marina Bay Sands, do not waste your money coming here
5
I visited Osteria Mozza with a friend on the way to cinema, due to long carpark wait, we didn't have much time. We informed the stuff and it was no problem, the food was coming quickly and was delicious! We didn't have wine, so can't comment on the price. The food was priced ok to its quality and the ambience of the restaurant. Definitely will go back
5
We had dinner of spicy chicken wings and Pizza with a nice red. Very expensive, but worth it. We loved it. Great Service and considering we didn't have a booking we managed to get a seat, then a table for 2 became vacant and they moved us (at our request) Nothing was too much trouble. Great spot to dine and people watch
3
The pizzas here are really good however the pricing is slightly high ! It came to 200 dollars for 3 pizzas and 2 glasses of wine - slightly ridiculous considering all we had was a pizza
4
Their pasta is one of the best I've had in Singapore. Ambience is alright and reservations recommended.
5
Dining with 3 teenagers can be tricky at times but they all loved Osteria Mozza....the iced teas were amazing, the pizzas Absolutely Yummo and the service was Fantastic! Our seats at the bar observing the pizzas being made was very novel! A great arvo!
4
We had an enjoyable & tasty meal.
Prompt service & good food at reasonable price.
Liked every thing - nothing to dislike
5
We had a delightful night. The staff were superb and the food could not be faulted. I would recommend the smaller portions and maybe try a few of the selections.
The bread selection was great.
Would recommend it too all.
4
Mozza is one of our favourites. We had Bufala Condiment, Caprese, Trout Salad, Endive, Ribollita (Iron Chef Mario Batali's signature dish) , Cappellaci (pumpkin), Truffle.
We enjoyed the dinner so much, we ended with Gelati and Fritelle di Riso (Rice pancakes) - absolutely sinful.
Ha
4
This is a busy, authentic and lively Italian style restaurant with excellent food, great Italian wine and service to match. In particular, the staff are very attentive and very knowledgeable about the food and the options available. Overall an experience to remember
4
Thoroughly enjoyed Osteria Mozza for my business dinner. You have two Mozza's adjacent to one another. The right one is Pizza style, the left one more formal Italian restaurant. I have chosen the left one. Service was great, they have a good wine selection, especially for those who like their Italian wines. Food was good, quite authentic Italian. The amoun tof time in between the courses was just about right
3
We came here when db's next door was full, for Sunday brunch. The menu is quite broad with pasta and antipasti plus steak and pastries. The seating is in a busy bistro type of restaurant. It was open to the mall and had views of the bar. I had the pork belly which was a round piece of pork (!) with crackling all around - some parts crispier than others - some parts were inedible: too chewy. It was covered in pesto and arugula with some bland flat breaded potatoes on the side. Not an amazing dish but okay. Friends ordered the ravioli (nothing memorable) wagyu steak (good but $45!) and lamb ragu tagliatell (again nothing memorable). My brunch was supposed to come with pastries but they instead put down one basket of 4 small pastries for the 4 of us. Not sure if this was my included pastries but I thought it was a meagre serving for a table of 4. The cappuccino was good - they did not have mochaccino available. Service was okay but we had to ask for water. Also after ordering, another waiter came by to give us menus again??? It was an okay meal, but for the price and quality there are better places. I wouldn't come back
5
from the moment you arrive in this beautiful restaurant you are greeted with some of the best service I have ever had. The management really has amazing training standards as there was not one detail overlooked. Now let's talk about the food and beverages. We ordered a glass of prosecco each to celebrate the occasion. Perfect refreshing and got our tastebuds rolling. Then we left our choices for wine to Han the amazingly professional sommelier. Wow did he pick some interesting and great wines. The food was outstanding some of the best I've ever had. The whole grilled fish the smoked trout salad and the spaghetti calabrese being the highlights for me. However everything on the table was tasty and well executed. Anand the bar man paired us a nice after dinner cocktail that really hit the spot. Truly appreciated team Mozza!! Keep up the good work
4
A lot of wine. A trendy crowd. A little noisy at the bar. Wine book larger than the dictionary. Sommelier to help with different regions of Italy. Snooty waitresses. Great Gourmet Food. Go here to have a good time with friends
5
We were offered to sit at the bar to get inside two hours later from passing by (we had to cancel our on line reservation for the evening before due to my being unwell), and we were fine with it, watching the barman mixing the drinks, having small talk with him, enjoying the relaxed atmosphere. I've had Burricota Walnut, Tagliatelle Verde, Melon Sorbetto and herbal tea, my hubby had Cobechino Lentil and something from Pork, Pannacotta and Cappuccino, everything was tasting oh so well and we paid about 225,- S$. During the dinner, the general manager came to introduce himself, we talked and decided to book for the New Year's Eve dinner when we will be in Singapore again. We wanted our friends join us but Osteria MOZZA is fully booked for the whole month since December 17. We are looking forward to experience it again, very much
4
We enjoyed our evening in Mozza. The service was friendly and very helpful explaining the menu. The wine list was good and the food excellent. I had a stacked bacon and egg salad to start, which was delicious and huge and in fact would have worked well as a main course. I had a fish dish with mushrooms for main which was good too. We were also given little samples of some of the mozzarella dishes by our waiter which were good too. It was quite expensive which was fine apart from one of our group had just a pasta with tomato which we thought the price was a bit over the top for. The only downside to the restaurant is that it is in a shopping centre so no view really and a lot of passersby. Would visit again
5
This is not my first time dining in Mozza, in fact, this is the 5th I'm here. Every time I come to Singapore, I try to make some time to dine here. Chef David never fails to disappoint with his remarkable skills. The orecchiette with sausage and Swiss chard is among the best pasta I ever had, and having said that, I've tried some pretty original and decent ones in Italy and none come near. The beef tagliata is heavenly too. Han, the sommelier, is a very friendly chap and his wine pairing make things even better. I understand that there are almost a thousand labels of Italian wine there but With him around, I always know that I'm in safe hand.The ambience is cozy and not pretentious at all, more like a bistro where you can have a good time surrounded by good food and wine. Service is prompt and excellent. Will definitely recommend to anyone that is looking for good Italian food in Singapore
3
Although other reviewers appreciate the relaxed atmosphere at Mozza, I was actually quite put off by the setting: it's in the middle of a shopping mall, with shutters that open out to passing shoppers/sightseers as well as long lines of people waiting to enter the theatres across the atrium. I also found the tables uncomfortably close together -- a situation that became more difficult to manage when a large family was seated in the cramped space between our table and the bar. Although we had booked Mozza for a celebratory dinner, we were so disappointed with the setting that we opted to leave after cocktails instead. The ambience obviously works well for many, but I would recommend diners carefully consider the setting before booking
4
Was in Singapore for an anniversary and decided to have a go at one of Marina Bay Sand's Celebrity Chef restaurants. I love the atmosphere and it felt more relaxed compared to many other fine dining restaurants.The service staff was very helpful with their recommendations from the menu. Very attentive.Do try the Tagliatelle with oxtail ragù. I have my share of pasta meals as I'm really a big fan of Italian food but the dish was just in a class of its own. The meat was succulent and the pasta was tasty. One of the best Italian meals I ever had
4
True the food is really, really good, the staff is nice and very attentive but seriously what is going on with the prices! I mean this is ridiculous !!! Fair enough the Waygu beef tagliata is 60$ (140$ if you want the big size !!!) but the agnoletti with butter and sauge are 57$ for a full plate ( 27$ for half plate but then you have like 8 pastas.....) seriously ? And it is like that for every dishes, go hungry for30$ or enjoy a normal sized dish for 60$ and compting.... Shame, I liked the place but you can definitely find italian restaurants as good but for much cheaper in Singapore!!
5
Love Mario Batali's restaurants and this one certainly did not disappoint!!! Started with a Caprese Salad with fresh mozzarella and oh my ... so delicious! Had a fresh seasonal pasta and it was amazing. Wait staff could not have been more friendly and accommodating. I was there as a single and felt extremely comfortable. Highly recommend making reservations! I was there on a Monday night and it was packed
1
What can one say about Mario Batali & his partner Joe Bastianich restaurant....speechless! I entered the restaurant which was beautiful and oozed ambience that is until I sat down opened the menu and held my head while I tried to grasp as to why anyone would pay $68 for a plate of pasta. I ordered the entree Osso Bucco (ive made better) which set me back $36 two fork fulls and the plate was empty . I orderd a glass of wine from the Bastianich winery and sent it back as it was acidic and settled for a glass of Prosseco $25 a glass. My friends were equally dissappointed. I have eaten in Tuscany where the dinning experience set me back 50 euro wine and all and that was considered expensive. Where do these two New Yorkers get off insulting the great chefs of Italy by passing off sub average Italian food at astronomical prices...shame......shame....sham
4
Yep, I did, much to the shock of both my husband and the waiter. The pasta was so nice I wanted it a second time. Now that is saying something!!! Great great italian food…..location - in the middle of a shopping centre…probably not the best view! But my husband had been here before and knowing how much I like a good pasta, he took me here and that was a good choice. The only downside was the brash Australian foul-mouthed horse investor sitting behind me who kept garbling on about how he knew the owner, the this, the that….he left the restaurant (phew) but then came back again 15 minutes later!!! Not the fault of the restaurant though….All different mozzarella starters - very good too! This restaurant has definitely mastered italian cooking! Thank you
5
Genuine Italian food, clearly made from fresh ingredients. This is accompanied by attentive and excellent service.
5
Loved the food and casual atmosphere in this busy eatery. Pizza was delicious but my favourite was their chicken liver pâté! A delicious dish with such a simple ready available ingredient and did not have that strong bitterness that some liver pâtés have.
5
From the entrance to its people, the food, they know how to treat you. Great place to be. Do not miss this place if you go to Singapore.
5
we wanted a place that makes their own dough and were recommended osteria. coming from a land of pizza where we take our pizza seriously, osteria serves out yummy pizza with melting cheese with dough that is not too thick or thin.
2
As it was a Saturday, we booked in advance and so no problem with getting a seat. The first thing that hit us was the loud music being played - loud rock. We proceeded to review the menu, and the food on offer were ordinary but cannot say the same for the price, so we expected something special. So we order the steamed muscles and sea trout salad for starters and pastas for main course. Whilst waiting, we wanted to have some wine and asked for the wine list, my jaw dropped when I saw the list being all in Italian, so I asked the waitress if there is a list in English but was rudely told that as it is an Italian restaurant they only serve Italian wines. So we decided not to have the wine as we are not familiar with them and didn't want to risk it for the very high price they were asking.By the time the food arrived, we were getting a little headache from the loud music. We ate the food which were very ordinary and couldn't wait to leave.We dined in numerous restaurants around the world, including 3 Michelin stars restaurants which were expensive but enjoyed the whole experience. But we were totally disappointed with Osteria Mozza and will not recommended it to anyone
5
we arrived without a reservation and were given two seats by the bar, the staff were absolutely lovely and knew the menu inside out, they were also very attentive without being overwhelming. the food was wonderful, truly italian dishes, fresh ingredients and great presentation. one of the best meals i've had in singapore
2
What I love about great italian food is its simplicity and honesty. I left Osteria wondering what I just ate as it had lost all of the wonderful things that make italian food so good. We ate the chefs tasting menu which started well, the chefs offerinf was sone prosciutto wrapped around a grisini, fantastic. What followed was overly sweet salads, overly tart mains and a confusing array of flavours that I struggled to identify over my stinging tastbuds and puckered lips. To add to the confusion I had the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Billy Idol serenading my date and I. I didn't enjoy another course until the palate cleansing coconut sorbet which was sadly followed by yet another overly worked dessert. This will not be on my list of must visits in the future. The final sting was the bill, $25 for a prosecco, definitely not Italian....
3
Went to the restaurant on the left for dinner on a Friday night, the food was quite average and certainly not worth the price paid, at over 230 dollars between two with just a glass of wine each. The staff are clearly trained to do some serious up-selling, which is OK but can get a little tedious! I would recommend the pizza restaurant on the right for much better and value for money experience
3
I dined here with several friends in mid-April 2014. It was terribly expensive, frenzied and fussy. The mozarella was delicious as were some of the other dishes, but oversalted in comparison with versions that I have had in Italy. I felt cheated and that this was a disgrace for any restaurant, much less for one with such pretensions. The meal didnâ€™t blow us away, but nothing went wrong either
4
Being Australia, I had never heard of Mario Batali but he sure does come up with some nice food!This is one of Marina Bay Sand's 'Celebrity Chef' restaurants and the food and service stand up on their own as worth the visit.My only issue was that there was little available on the menu for Vegetarians. The Carnivores with me enjoyed their meal immensely though and what I did have, was delicious.
5
One of the best places in Singapore for a real bite of Italy. Don't miss the Buratta pizzas, Stuffed Zucchini Flowers and Arancini balls - all made to perfection and extremely moreish!
5
One of my greatest experiences in a restaurant. Excelent service, personal and made our dinner complete experience. The food was mindblowing and the care and service our waitress gave us was probably even better! Wouldn't have missed it for the world.
4
Serving what is undoubtedly some of the best if not THE best Italian is Osteria Mozza in Marina Bay Sands!The food is heavenly to say the least. We were greeted by cheese crostinis compliments of the chef which were mouthwatering and raised our expectations of the dishes to be served.For appetizers we ordered the burrata with cherry tomatoes and pesto and I have to admit that it tops even the best burrata i have had in Italy!For mains we had the grilled leg of lamb and the spaghetti alla Calabrese and while both were perfect, special mention goes to the grilled leg of lamb which was a culinary delight!Where things go very very sour is the portions and price. The restaurant is insanely expensive. Dinner 1 appetizer, 1 primi (small portion) and one secondi with a bottle of water would set you back 200 Dollars!This restaurant would easily get a 5 star rating had it not been for the price
2
Both of Mario's restaurants at Marina Bay are very good but the prices are so outrageous I just won't go there anymore. Today my wife and I shared a pizza, shared an appetizer and shared dessert and I had a glass of wine and it came to $100USD. I say again one hundred dollars for a pizza, squash flowers a dessert and a glass of wine. Ripoff! If the rent is so high at Marina Bay that you have to charge these prices then move
4
Located in a mall next to MArina Bay sands it is an Italian split in 2. Pizzaria to the right. A la carte to the left. The a la carte is wher we went. Liggting just right. Staff VERY attentive. You can sit at a table or at the marble bar. Ambience is livey..but not distracting. Pasta are freshly made....Fish was fresh and tasty...Extensive wine list ....all in all it scores high across the board...and it doesn't break the bank like The Cut does which is situated right opposite them., Definately a place for coupls and groups. Management on top of everything. It's a winner !!
2
The food was ok, but for the money it should be far better than ok. The major disappointment started out by realizing this was just in the middle of a mall. There was not any effort to make you feel like you are not in a mall. This place is extremely expensive for the quality. I used to like Mario Batali.
5
I am dining here alone at the bar on a stopover. Love love love the food. I have had plates of octopus,burrata and now fish for main. Its relaxed fine food, which you can't beat. I get sick of the attitude you get in fine diners but this place has struck the right cord. My waiter kroydel has been wonderful too. Highly recommend
5
This is not cheap but by heavens is it good. Run under the watchful eye of Owen the GM who is often moving around chatting and ensuring you are happy, Mario Batali's restaurant iis of a standard not seen too often.The food is exquisite, the cocktails etc are made with pride and perfection. It has the Batali flare stamped all over it.I could not fault it. We went as a special experience knowing it would cost us a bit, but we enjoyed it so much and Owen was such a great host - would love to go back next time in Singapore

We visited Osteria Mozza as a treat on the final night of our honeymoon! We had the chefs tasting menu which is newly selected every night, so no two nights are the same.. We also arrange to have matching wines with our meal. From the get go, the service was amazing! We had two lovely waiters who helped us. One was more than happy to explain why we were having particular wines (and was patient enough to wait for me to take a picture of each wine bottle) and described our meals before we at them!The whole team made us feel very special, whilst it isn't the cheapest place... It was worth every penny for the experience
5
From the moment you walk in the service is impeccable! There was not one point that we could pick at. The set-up is perfect!And not to mention the food, wow! Our mains where the leg of lamb and the linguine with clams - both were delicious and perfectly cooked! The portion sizes are generous which is nice for such a restaurant. I would highly recommend Osteria Mozza to any of my friends or family! So if you planning a trip to Singapore and your budget allows then definitely plan a meal here!

Went to the restaurant side not the pizza side. Food was good and well presented but it was nothing amazing and the wine was super expensive
All in all not a bad meal but I would have been better off spendin g the money elsewhere
1
Really Not worth going there... Pizza is Not a real pizza. Wine and staff are Nice though but the good is really disappointing.
4
The quality you expect from Mario. Great food, bit snotty service.
Price fits the high end mall
I prefer the pizza side for value
5
a definite go-to place! with ambience, with character and with very good food. a new meaning to delicious = MOZZA
3
food was good.
service was OK.
premise was tight and crowded.
verdict: still a go-to place since you are at MBS.
experience could have been 4/5 had the entrance staff been less racist.
4
Last visit we had dinner for six, and ordered three different kind of pizzas.. All is very good, and the best one is with slices of ham on top.
We also love the slices of ham the serve individually..very yummy!

I took my wife and kids to Osteria on a week end trip to Singapore.Restaurant's deco is very nice, with a New York touch.We only tried pizzas as prices are quite high but were absolutely delighted !I mean pizzas are delicious and it makes Osteria a must go place for this reason.Service is excellent and fast. Deco is romantic and nice. Location is perfect if you come to gamble at casino.Visit Osteria and you won;t be disapointed
5
Visited the restaurant for the second time with the family.We were 3 adults and 2 kids.The pizzas were simply outstanding as were the appetisers. The salads and olives were of very high quality and was followed for desserts which were among the best we have ever had.The restaurant could well turn out to our family's favourite restaurant in Singapore - and is a huge compliment indeed as we eat out very often and try new restaurants.The service staff were also very very knowledgeable and helpful and courteous. All this of course comes at a price for the quality of the food and the location. Pizzas cost 27 to 35 dollars and desserts upwards of S$ 15.Our bill was S$ 208 for 2 kids and 3 adults and no alcohol - but once in a while you have to tip your hat and forget the price and appreciate the splendid evening of food we had and the unmatched hospitality and memories. Kudos - please keep it up as we will be there more often - even if we have to 'ouch' when the bill arrives :-) I love reviewing Hotels and restaurants so that others may benefit form my experience, just as I rely on the experience of others to make my holidays and restaurant choices better. Hope this review was useful

So often the thought of dining in an Italian restaurant leads to disappointments, but not so with Osteria Mozza! All the staff...and I mean ALL the staff...really went out of their way to provide wonderful hospitality...great service (just when you needed it - if not before) and delectable high quality Italian cuisine that was really yummie and so tasty and interesting!Highly recommended
4
Went there for the 3rd time with my wife, and I couldn't think of anything better than the delicious iberia pork chop. It was juicy and tender, heavenly. We had the small portion of clam pasta as starter and it was just ok. Then after the satisfying pork chop we ordered the chocolate lava cake with ice cream, it was also very good
5
Our pre theatre dinner was quick and with excellent quality of food. Service is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere made our one hour dinning to be relax and feel good before heading for the show. Will return again and again.
4
I thought my margharita pizza here was the best I've had outside Italy. My friend was less impressed with his pizza. The service was slow and I asked for Parmesan but it never arrived! My raspberry lemonade was delicious too!
4
Extremely busy. Very noisy. Tables crammed together. Gorgeous yummy food but quite expensive. Second visit in 2 years. Would go again for the food but not for the atmosphere.
3
I visited this place with a friend highly recommending their pizzas. The pizza dough was on a drier side, it is nothing close to the ones I have eaten in Italy, but still the best among all the below average pizza places in Singapore.
4
Very busy restaurant, however we were glad we waited and got a table. Make sure you reserve in advance. Food was delicious, and staff terrific. Bread was to die for..... However the wine list was too comprehensive and difficult to choose. It was a huge folder that was difficult to read. Make it simpler please
4
amazing service given by staff despite the busy and peak hour.can't demand much of the waitress for we understand the demands of our neighbor guests.good foods, very high price. was sitting at the bar and finally got a table for two opposite where we were seated. unexpectedly got a table. love the music. upbeat. knowledgeable staff yet entertaining. delighted by the surprise candle on my birthday dessert. will definitely come back with family and friends! keep up the good work. kudos to the staffs. great team you had there! memorable 29th of july. best time of my life. thank you osteria team

Decided on Mozza for its strong international reputation and its great location just opposite the theater. Was here for an early dinner so that we could just walk across to the theatre to watch the musical. Restaurant was relatively quiet when we arrived but gradually filled up quickly so do make reservation. Beautiful restaurant with a contemporary feel. Service was efficient. Knowledgeable staff. W had the mozzeralla and the grilled beef tagliata. The food arrived fast which was good with us. The dishes were up to standard, tasty and of good quality. We appreciated the attentive of the manager who came by once in a while to ask us about the food and the restaurant. Glad we made the decision to dine here. We couldn't order more food this time as we had to rush but definitely will stay longer next time to try out the desserts 
2
Despite food's high quality the service was poor. We arrived around 10h45pm and as soon as we seat the waiter told us that the last order had to be taken up to 11pm. This is a kind of information to be given by the hostess. Service was slow, with a lot of misunderstandings and took a lifetime to charge our credit cards
5
We dropby and check if they have available for 2. They only have a seat at the bar but we don't mind. We were immediately greeted and serve by the bar name Anandha i hope i remember it right. He was very friendly and helpful with the menu. My boyfriend was very pleased with his service and told me that he is the best staff he had encountered in Singapore.We loved the food and surely be back
4
I love Mario. So when we knew we were visiting Singapore we had to check-out his restaurant that sits beside his pizzeria. It didn't disappoint. It never does. Front desk was a little busy and stretched but our waiters rectified the hassled greet & meet. We were seated at one of what I considered the best table in the house. Corner table with a full view of the restaurant and its activities. We were presented with lovely warm house bread that was moorish and utterly delectable. The amuse bouche of handmade ricotta balls were light and well seasoned. That laid out the palette for what was to come. Starters of their famed burrata and nicely charred octopus respectively was sheer heaven. Fresh with layers of taste and flavour. Mains of braised rabbit was tenderly cooked without over-seasoning and celery root Cappellacci with mushrooms was out of this world. Mario does pasta best! Desserts of Bombolini was divine - 'mini doughnuts' minus the hole with sharp huckleberry couli hit the spot. It helped cut out the richness of the dish. Torta della Nonna - a simple almond pastry with a spot of vanilla ice-cream was perfection. Thank you Mario - that's why we love you
3
Great food but seriously overpriced. If you don't care about the bill, come here. Great service, al dente pasta, buzzy atmosphere.
5
We dined here tonight and the food and the atmosphere was amazing. The portions were just right. We really enjoyed the experience.
5
I made a reservation here with some friends on a whim - like 30 minutes prior. It was the best decision of the week. The waitstaff is as helpful and knowledgeable as you would expect from fine dining, but there's also a casual friendliness that is infectious. Of course, what matters most is the food. And the food was soooooooo good. An amuse bouche came before our meal that was a delicious ricotta on a delicious cracker with deliciousness on top. My first course was from the mozzarella bar - burrata with grilled asparagus. I could eat that every day of my life. My second course was agnolotti with butter & sage. Filled with tender meaty goodness. The flavor was perfect. We were so satisfied that we skipped to dessert. I had the olive oil cakes with olive oil gelato. Seriously, if you go here and you can't decide on dessert, I'm telling you now, this is what to get. I would have licked my plate if I wasn't in polite company
5
They seated me quickly after being rejected by db bistro because I refused to sit at the bar. The waiter recommended I had the roast pork with crackling skin. The food was amazing! Seeing me alone, the waiter gave me a book to read, by Joe Bastianich. What can I say, good food and good service, I was willing to pay top price for such restaurant
5
Just flew in to Singapore (14 hour flight) and was staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel and needed a light dinner. Had read good things about Osteria Mozza so decided to give it a try. Had a Burrata Caprese to start which was fantastic. 5 or 6 types, sizes and colours of tomatoes, all fantastically ripe, a dollop of creamy mozzarella (from the mozzarella bar) and some perfectly fresh pesto. Yum. Since I was eating light I just ordered a small size pasta course (all the pasta dishes had two sizes in case you wanted it as an intermediate course or a main). I had the oxtail ragu tagliatelle and I couldn't think if how it could be improved. Pasta cooked to perfection, plenty of meat/sauce with bags of flavour, and perfectly seasoned. I was on my own so sat at one of the many seats at the bar and got great service and some nice conversation (but not too much) from one of the bartenders. I had a glass of white wine (a vermentino) and a glass or red (from mt etna on Sicily), both were excellent and the bartender gave generous pours (don't tell Mario). I always worry about being disappointed when I eat at celebrity chef outposts (I'll bet mario only makes it here once a year, if that), but my worry was unfounded here. Great service, great food, great wine...not cheap, but still highly recommended
5
Actually ate here twice during a recent trip to Singapore. It's that good! The food menu is quite extensive, with tons of options. Nothing comes close to their hand-made pastas. Their fish dishes are also delectable. During both visits I started with a cheese starter (Burrata) and then only had a small portion of a pasta for my main (Orecchiette and Ricotta Gnocchi with Chanterelle mushrooms & Bloomsdale spinach). Everything was superb. The wine menu is also quite extensive, but the sommelier can assist. This is a must-do when in Singapore. The food, wine, and service are exceptional. One of the best meals I've had in a long time
5
This restaurant is by celebrity chef Mario Batali. My second visit and always a pleasure. Food flavors burst in your mouth. We booked the Pizzeria next door but managed to get the Osteria due to a cancellation and the experience was fantastic. Pasta dishes are great like duck ragu or pasta with sausage. All dishes from entree to mains are so authentic. Accompanied by Merlot the dishes were even better. Pricey but well worth it. Don't forget to book else forget about getting a table !
3
I went here with a few work colleagues and didn't have the best experience. We only got main courses which seemed to annoy our waiter (who was a bit grumpy for some reason). I got tortellini in a broth which I would not recommend. Some of our dishes were nice and others were only ok hence the 3/5
5
Five of us ate at this restaurant including one child. We all had totally delicious meals not to mention the dessert! Excellent and friendly staff too .. very attentive. It's quite expensive and we did not order wine like we normally would do back home in Australia (a bottle we would pay $20 for here was over $80 on their wine list!) but I think the quality of the food still makes this a must do while in Singapore. Unfortunately we didn't get back to try the Pizzeria next door
5
Fabulous food, personal service, wonderful interiors!!! The place was busy busy busy with lots of people, yet, even when the place was packed, the atmosphere stayed pleasantly marvelous....service was personal and efficient, the food was warm, uniquely creative, deliciously flavorful, airconditioning was cool, tables were perfectly spaced out to be comfortable and coZy, reasonably pricey and well worth it. We had the flatbreads with feta, basil & olives; the squid dish, fries w/rosemary, pastas & parmigiana. What an unforgettable experience Osteria Mozza is. :
5
was there many times and will visit this for sure many times more.
you can really taste the freshness of the food.
if you love Italian food,mozza is the place to go.
by the way,best negronis in town also.great restaurant.
4
Have to say quality of food exceptional. All dishes extremely tasty and well presented . Service Attentive. Shame about location as a little impersonal
5
We went there for pre-theatre dinner. Food arrived fast and delicious. Staff are very knowledgeable with recommendation and ensure that their guests were happy. It was a busy evening but we felt comfortable in a well designed restaurant and perfect lighting.
4
Great experience, we did not have a reservation on saturday night and we ended on the bar counter having diner. we had a Malaysian Bar Lady, she was excellent, very knowledgeable and friendly. She prepared us Calamansit Capiroska, delicious.The food was excellent too with some great antipasti with burrata, ricotta. The main were great too, my friend had the grilled lemon spiced chicken, delicious ( I had to try, sorry), I had the sweetbread which I loved served with some crispy spinach. To finish the meal we shared the chocolate flour less cake. A real winner and super decadent. Loved it.We will come back, and thank you for the great evening
3
Having visited Mozza for a second time I decided that my previous thoughts were incorrect. Initially I'd thought it was just a bit muddled and out of place but I now feel that it just simply doesn't offer value for money.Restaurants should of course primarly be judged on their food and in that repsect it's far from bad, but it is very expensive for what is a glorified and crowded canteen.Many people mark the restaurant up for atmosphere but to me they are misplacing atmosphere for what is quite simply 'noise' and at the end of the day, you are sitting in a canteen with an open window to a shopping centre which for 50pct of the restaurant is what you are sat looking at.The wine list is as overpriced as you'd expect for an MBS outlet, couple that with a guinea fowl that can cost you 120 bucks and it's an expensive night out in a restaurant where it is very hard to get the staff's attention.It will continue to thrive and be packed out every night due to it's status but there is far better available for less in Singapore
3
A fairly average experience, across multiple visits for dinner and once for brunch - food is OK, with some very inconsistent dishes, service alternates between good and bad, very hard to build any sort of on-going rapport with the staff despite visiting on several occasions (front of house/reception staff being entirely devoid of any sort of emotions). This feels like a very formulaic and managed experience from start to finish.Like the Pizzeria, which is all around much better, the Osteria is afflicted by inept rules which impede the experience - asking for anything remotely off the menu seems to set off a chain reaction of anxious hesitations throughout the staff, apparently petrified at the thought of going back to the kitchen...As an aside, the "brunch" is bizarre - it advertises the pastries of chef Adriana (who's terrific herself) as well as a main course but it's only when you reach the bar where the pastries are displayed that you are informed that you can only take 2... idiotic and misleading.Overall, a decent location for lunch or dinner (not brunch!) but a major missed opportunity to better focus on the experience of true Italian hospitality
5
Went with a friend to share the degustation menu - and split the menu choices so tried everything. Every course was great, and the quantities appropriate for degustation so did not feel over full. Highlights for me - the little gem lettuce with English peas, asparagus, radishes and labneh toast for antipasto - delicate fresh flavours beautifully put together, the mozzarella bar selections, the farfalle with maitake mushrooms, peas and walnuts, the wagyu beef and the berry crespelle. But there wasn't a disappointing dish. Service was excellent , and the two wines recommended by the glass (we didn't want all the matching wines) were excellent. It is not cheap, but the food and service made it a great treat
1
When we told my 11 daughter that we were going here for pizza, she kicked up a fuss and said couldn't we remember how bad it was the first time we went?! Well, clearly we couldn't but we should have listened to her! The pizzas are expensive and just not pleasant. My daughters was undercooked and soggy and the topping was sparse to say the least. Ours was slightly more palatable and just about cooked. What ruins them totally though is the huge amount of what I guess is olive oil poured onto them after cooking - drizzling this was not! They were swimming with oil. To complement the pizza, the service was poor - inattentive staff, and it takes ages for anything to arrive. We could see our 2nd beers standing on the bar for 15 minutes waiting for a waiter to bring them over - my husband got them himself, as we gave up waiting. I would not go back here. Just a note - we are referring to the pizzeria half of the restaurant and we have not tried the other side, which I think is a la carte.

We dined at Osteria Mozza last week, deciding we were last at this restaurant in Las Vegas and therefore had to try it in Singapore. For those with the option, Vegas food is better, Singapore staff is better. We were traveling with a baby and the staff was amazing with her (will be back for the staff friendliness alone). They brought out a small portion of pasta for her, along with our appetizers, so that she could eat quickly. For those with kids, you know how important that is. All in all, this is a very nice restaurant with high quality food and great staff. Favorite part of the meal was we told the sommelier our order and requested wines by the glass to match, and let him choose for us. Our makeshift food/wine pairing. Highly recommend the grilled octopus for an appetizer. We had all had a wonderful meal and experience
5
After visiting the Pizzeria Mozza three times, I was lucky to get a chance to dine at Osteria Mozza. It was a send off dinner by my friend. We ordered the frilled Octopus & Calamari fritters for starters. Ravioli & Sea bream fish with herba for the main course. Grilled potatoes with rosemary was our vegetable dish.We thoroughly enjoyed the food. It was tasty & very unique. The ravioli were cooked to perfection & the fillings were awesome. We shared the main dishes & hence got to know what each dish tasted like. The grilled fish was deboned & stuffed with herbs. The waitress said the fish was flown from Greece. Earlier they used snapper & now they have sea bream fish. For the dessert we ordered Chocolata (not sure if I remember the italian spelling correctly). It was bitter sweet & the fudgy portion tasted great. Texture, taste & quality all were good. Wine sounded expensive. Being a coffee lover, I ordered for a cappuchino. Instead of serving that after the dessert the waiter served it before. And when the dessert arrived (was served by a tall good looking guy), the table turned out crowded. But just a minor glitch. Sad that Budino is served in Pizzeria not Osteria.A great experience.
3
good place for casual dining. a bit expensive, but correct, efficient service and very good pizzas, more choice can better.
4
Ansloutly superb. The flavors r sooo much betters than the LA place. A must have is their braised wagyu and their green pasta with lamb. Come hungry and share all dishes. This is a place where u dont mind all the calories.
4
My first night in Singapore... Impressive Italian with a very creative menu. Beware as it's expensive but affordable options are available. Wine is the most expensive I have even seen... $6000 for a bottle in a shopping centre!
4
If your looking for Chicken Parmesan or Spaghetti Meatballs this is not your place. The expensive menu is filled with duck, quail and lamb. The Mozzarella bar choices were fantastic. Mozza is definitely a place too see and be seen. Overall a good experience.
5
a few days ago I hosted a dinner for my own birthday and had my family and closest friends around me.Words can't describe how divine the food , drinks and service was in this surely one of the city's best restaurants.beside anything the events executive dealing with the preplanning (Ms Sam) was 6 star and made sure every little detail was exactly how I wished it.simply superb (I know I repeat myself)Trust this amazing restaurant, you won't be disappointe
3
My first experience there was initially very happy as it was our first time, my friend & myself. Until the end of the dining, after I visited the loo & I was greeted by a young lady wearing a white shirt standing outside saying; I thought something happened to you as I wanna go to check it out on you. I looked at my phone & I took 4 mins inside there, was there a snake inside there or??? this staff probably wanna go back early but I really appreciate if her nicer words can be put in a better way. This lady really needs a lots of training on her speech & attitude as my friend was wondering why she said that too?? Was she cursing on the customer who spent $313++ on this restaurant??Fyi, the ambience was very nice, romantic & cozy But the rock & roll music just didn't set in
4
I put off visiting Osteria Mozza simply because it's located in a shopping mall. I'm not a huge fan of that setting in Marina Bay Sands. However, I decided to give the place a chance since 1) the reviews are pretty decent and 2) I was getting bored of my usual repertoire of restaurants in Singapore. I’m glad I went to Mozza. The meal was expensive but good. The menu is extensive and has a wide array of both classic and creative Italian dishes. I really enjoyed the oxtail ragu! The service was very slick, undoubtedly due to their American ownership and management. If you can ignore the shopping mall outside and the tour groups buzzing around and peeking into the restaurant, the décor and interior of the restaurant is nice. I loved the dark wood floors and the counter/open kitchen concept. One piece of feedback I would give is that they need to provide better translations of the menu. Too many of the dishes were noted in Italian and I had no clue what they were. The wine list could also be better organised in English instead of Italian. Because of this, we spent too long reviewing the menu and it gave for a very confusing experience. I was sceptical at first but pleasantly surprised with Mozza. It’s pricey so it won’t be my regular Italian haunt, but I will be back
4
Book in advance for a table as this place gets busy. We went mid week and due to an excellent reputation and food it was quite busy. Owen the general manager was on top of all the staff ensuring service worked like a well oiled machine ! The staff were knowledgeable and very service oriented. Food was excellent. If we lived I Singapore this would be a regular feature in our diaries
3
The food was good, but for the outrageous prices I would go somewhere else first. Of course half of it is the Batalli name...but I did not find anything to be amazing. It was alright and has a nice atmosphere, so if you are looking for a trendy restaurant you want your friends on Facebook to see you check in at, this is your place. If you're hungry, go to the food court downstairs

It was just by chance that I chose to dine at this restaurant. I was wandering through Marina Bay Sands looking at the myriad of options. It looked appealing from outside. I got straight in on a Sunday night without a reservation but I was dining alone. I took the option of a seat at the bar and was kept entertained by Mike the barman. He had certainly had the up selling training session recently (I was waiting for him to offer an upsize option or ask if I wanted fries with that) but he was pleasant enough. The food was magnificent. The focaccia bread was awesome. I had the wagyu with rocket and parmesan with a side of rosemary potatoes for main. The meal was hot and the greens very fresh. The dressing on the salad added perfectly to the meal rather than being the taste of the meal.The music was very loud and certainly nothing like I had heard in any trattoria in Italy. Lucky I was not trying to have a conversation. It did make it hard for me to overhear the staff talking about the guest at a table near me when they thought they were out of ear shot. I heard enough to make me glad the music was loud and I could not hear more. The suits they were wearing may have been fancy but the trash talk was not.It was expensive. S$130 for one main, one side dish, sparkling water and one bourbon. It may have been classed as a Celebrity Restaurant but this did not create any expectations for me as I had never heard of the "celebrity"
4
Serves good italian food next to Pizzeria Mozza. There was a bit of a wait for the food, and our group got their meals at different times. Otherwise, the food was great and so were their drinks. Recommended if you are nearby and like italian.
5
I loved food!!!
Recommend for anyone having special days...
I liked the chef menu. It is worth try!!!
good service on the floor.
4
Burratta with leeks vinaigrette. Orecchiette. A bottle of Amarone or Valpolicella. Attentive service. Heaven. My personal tip is to book a table by a corner or wall.
4
If you are not afraid to pay sgd 60 for pasta, just go!
I love to go to osteria mozza....yummy!
Went several times... Osteria side, not the pizzeria one.
Good italian wines but que caro!

After visiting one of the popular exhibitions at Marina Bay Sands, Charmaine* and I decided to have dinner at Pizzeria Mozza's - an urban Italian restaurant serving unique creations of wood-oven pizzas by a very hospitable service crew. A pizza bistro / restaurant filled with happy diners chatting away on each table, Pizzeria Mozza's oozes warm Italian hospitality and a very easy-going ambience. There were large "brick ovens" reminscence of an old-fashioned Italian trattoria, where one could see the chefs busy at work through the windows, preparing the delicious pizzas for its zesty patrons.The Honey Glazed Chicken Wings came first - large, juicy and simply tender. I did not eat the greasy, non-crispy skins though - the large chicken wings offered more than enough well-flavored, silkened flesh for us to devour. This dish definitely opened up our gastronomical capacity for the upcoming pizza.Yes, the woodfire oven Parma Ham and Mozarella Pizza was dished to us - thickly crusted, crispy and tantalizing with the hints of charred smokiness - I love that, for some reason. The ham and cheese were deliciously saltish, paired with the rocket salad atop, and the crispiness of the pizza base - the burst of flavors and sensations was amazing.

Having experience with "celebrity restaurants" here in the States, my expectations weren't too high when we visited Osteria Mazzo. However, I was pleasantly surprised. We started with the crispy pigs trotter, which was delicious. I had the goat cheese ravioli for a main, just the right mix of tangy and savory, and my husband had the pan roasted pork chop, which was cooked to perfection. The cipollini onions and roasted broccoli sides were also very good. Desert was incredible - the bombolini for myself, with the huckleberry jam and vanilla gelato! - and James had some sort of chocolate torte that he really seemed to enjoy.  Service is excellent, our waiter was very attentive. The atmosphere and decor was nice, however it was a bit too loud to be considered "romantic". This would be a great place to take business associates
5
The restaurant has two parts: an osteria and a pizzeria. I have never tried the pizzeria.The Osteria has an very good gastronomical menu with assorted wines. It is a six course dinner with small portions, and all the dishes are excellent. The menu has enough alternatives to cater for fish and meat lovers, and the assorted wines might not always be that convincing on their own, but they are very good accompanying the dishes. The menu has a good balance between salad, mozzarella dishes, pasta and mains with a sorbet and dessert to top it off.It is not really a restaurant to take children, and the seating hours for reservations are a bit awkward (6.30 and 9 pm), but we have been able to secure a table by walking up to the restaurant on a Friday night.it is quite pricey, but well worth from time to time
1
I cannot understand how this place is consistently full. My standards were already based on it being a celebrity restaurant in a tourist mall, so they weren't that high, but the meal was so bad it was appalling.They pretend the pizzas are all made fresh (it even advises on the menu that you may be waiting up to 40 minutes for the pizza as they're all custom made). As we finished a lukewarm but flavourful appetizer it was a surprise to see the pizza delivered - less than 15 minutes after ordering it. The crust was cold, the plate was cold, the toppings were cold. I have never sent food back in my life. I sent back the $40 pizza. The server didn't seem put off (or surprised) and said we'd have another one momentarily. Great. Of course the new 'custom' pizza was also cold. Save your evening and go somewhere else
5
Few restaurants in Singapore are run more professionally than Mozza where you can always expect consistently excellent creative modern Italian cooking. The squid ink spaghetti with uni is one of my favourite dishes anywhere. Brunch on Sundays come with their own special menu that doesn't disappoint.The decor is traditional with dark wood panelling and romantic dim lighting. Classic, mature, comfortable. Service here always impressed as well. The hosts at the door may sometimes come across as intimidating thanks to how well groomed they are, but the servers are warm and know the menu well.Never a disappointment.

We were drawn to this place from walking through the shopping centre by its decore and ambiance, and were welcomed by a very friendly man and seated at our table straight away which was pretty lucky being a bit later on in the night on a Sunday. From there however it was all pretty much downhill. I asked advice on a nice glass of red wine similar to what I'd get in Australia,full bodied and close to a Shiraz. I was suggested an Italian wine (for $27 a glass!) and thought why not he must know what he's in about. It was average at best. Then our group of four ordered. I ordered the wagu beef which I asked he big it was and was told 600-700grams. It came out and was no more than 200 grams!! My friends gnocchi he ordered had a lousy 6 pieces of tiny potato for $28 and it just got worse. The waiter named ROY (I got from the receipt) was a rude as he'll and didn't want a bar of us after bit ALL wanting entree AND mains. When he brought some things out he wouldn't even make eye contact. He spilt my wine on the table while pouring also. The "still water" he offered for the table came out and ended up costing us $24. Total bill for 4 people $310.73 and left starving. With no more than one drink each. The taste of the food was quite nice but portion size and this waiter Roy destroyed our experience.
4
We ate at the more casual side of this restaurant and really enjoyed our meal. The food and service were excellent. The waiters made great recommendations on the menu and my only regret is that I only got the chance to eat there once!
5
We arrived at a very busy restaurant on a friday evening but they still squeezed us in at the pizza bar without a reservation.
Service was prompt, the Mozza Martini excellent and the Pizza arrived when they said it would and was brilliant

We had lunch in this place. The pizza took forever to arrive and had almost no cheese! It was thin crust but gummy, and had a squalid piece of cheese in the centre. Besides, it was the most expensive pizza we ever had.The service was appalling
2
Visited on weekend trip, no reservations but were grateful for immediate sitting in packed house. Shared app, two cocktails, shared pizza (suitable for two). App came cold, we let it slide, ate it anyway. Pizza came cold. Mentioned to waitress who very nicely said that "proscuitto is put on last at room temperature". No, the crust was cold. Replacement pizza came in under 4 mins, cold. They appear to be cooking the pie en masse then topping with customized items to order. In and out in under 45 mins. Truly awful, $100 for the meal. Not recommended for any occasion.

We have been twice now before heading across to the theatre. Over the two meals we tried a range of dishes and were particularly impressed by the oxtail ossobuco, and the wagu beef main. We were advised on different glasses of wine by the bar staff and they got it spot on for the different dishes. We will definitely be back
4
Positioned in the Marina Bay complex, the restaurant was busy but we got a table quickly.The food and wine were excellent, with a great selection of cheese and pasta dishes. The standard of the service was good but nothing exceptional. The seared tuna was delicious and cooked to perfection. Decor was good as you'd expect and as should be expected in this location.Not cheap so don't expect it, especially in this area. So generally good value at 100 sterling or so a head

I arrived in Singapore following 24 hours of travel and asked for a single seat. They put me at the bar, which didn't really appeal, but i was wrong! Great, attentive - i would even use the word caring - service! And the food was fabulous. I recommend this restaurant highly (and say hello to the friendly bartenders!
4
Sat at the bar on a couple of occasions and found the service to be good and the food tasty. They do a really nice sautÃ©ed broccoli dish with chilli which I often had with fish...their rosemary potatoes are delicious too. Not cheap but good value for Singapore and for the standard of food
2
It's a shame to call this restaurant Italian, nothing with this place had any Italian in it, well maybe the name, but except that; nothing. The food was waaaay to complicated- the thing with the Italian cuisine is the simplicity, which I love - and it felt like this restaurant had tried to hard and mixed a lot of ingredients och spices and it ended up with something inedible. My pasta was suppose to be tomato sauce, chili and prawns, but the only thing I could taste was lemon. It wasn't good at all.And I should probably mention that we payed $188 for four dishes, which is $47 for ONE PERSON. Yeah, don't think so...And by the way, this "Italian" restaurant didn't have any Tiramisu. What kind of Italian restaurant don't have Tiramisu!?And oh, one more thing! When we just got there the waiter offered Prosciutto and we answered "three" but he thought we said "free" and yeah, things got really awkward..
3
The food was up to what I would expect for a Batali restaurant but I found the menu a bit too large like a diner & the service experience was a little confused. The inside of the restaurant had good intentions but it felt a little silly to be paying the prices they charged when you are literally dining in a mall and your view are the shoppers and stores
5
Great Italian food in Singapore. Very authentic and tasty. Being in a large mall, the atmosphere is very "mall like" and hence not what I would say is cool.
However, a great overall experience. Just forget the calories for a day!
4
Finally had the chance to visit Mozza, after many frieds told me about it, and surely was a good idea.
Great pizza and great selecetion of well executed Italian food!
4
This was our first time at a Mario Batali restaurant, and we can't wait to try another on our side of the world. The Pizza was amazing and the staff so friendly. They offered us a free cocktail and a free desert.
4
We went there Dec 30 for dinner and enjoyed and liked the Osteria very much. Service was very good and we would say that it was the best italian food we were served on our 4 journeys to Asia. The tagliata was like in Italy. The pasta with lamb ragout or bolognese. Wow. yummy. No, it wasn't cheap !!!! But very good. If you avoid cocktails and wine the check will be a lot smaller.
5
As with Italian food in general there were some very hearty and flavoursome vegetarian options at Osteria Mozza. The restaurant decor was really nice, and the service was great. My favourite was the dessert - we had the Bombolini with huckleberry marmellata & vanilla gelato and it was the easily best dessert I've ever had in a restaurant. The portion was huge and can be easily shared by two, and it was very, very delicious
4
Went with a group of friends without a reservation on a busy evening. The hostess was kind enough to squeeze us in onto the bar counter seats. The bartender was very friendly and guided us through the menu occasionally giving us dining tips. Cocktails were the usual classics nothing spectacular or experimental, good but not amazing. Then came the food. We were advised not to go for the main portions of the pasta dishes since there were large and quite over priced. We ordered 4 pasta dishes in starter portions and man were we disappointed! Disappointed that we didn't get the larger portions. All 4 dishes were cooked to perfection! Sadly, the main courses that followed could top the first dish, mind you they were well made but lacked the wow factor the first dish had. Will definitely return but only for pasta this time
3
Location in the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall, modern style italian food, the buffalo mozzarella variation is very recommendable as a starter, the Pasta is also very good with some asian influence, they also have a good wine list with a great variety of italian wines, it is not a romantic place for a Dinner, the restaurant was quite full and the staff was very busy all the time, it's a nice place to get a little italian feeling, the value for money was quite low,the food was too expensiv
3
Visited the place for lunch last week after sightseeing around MBS, not cheap nor expensive for lunch around the area. Ordered mushroom pizza (can't really remember the name) and white wine mussels for myself and shared dessert with my mum. food was nice and but the service wasn't that good, only the service staff were seen smiling and interacting with customers unlike the rest
2
Looks great, staff friendly…. but….but does not really deliver the goods. Perhaps if they employed staff who actually understood cooking methods and were allowed to taste the food, the outcome might improve. For example I ordered rabbit lovely waitress said: ‘it is very slowly cooked in its juices in the oven’. I am thinking slow cooking = 1-2 hrs and that it is a casserole type dish. WRONG it was roasted. Talk about dry, could not eat it all. My companion had spaghetti: it was just so, so. This place is all a façade. Not worth the money
4
After 3 weeks travelling alone, got a critical lack of italian food. By coincidence step into osteria Mozza and wow! Agree that receptionist should be changed: so unoleasant and arrogant. But once inside excellent service, very good italian food. The idea to borrow me the joe b. Book while I was there alone gave me something interesting and different to do and help not feeling that bad "business alone meal" feeling. Got very good burrata, salumi while gnocco fritto should be better studied. Overall a very good mea
4
Did not have a reservation but the staff still got us a table. Food was good and the service was pleasant and attentive. Will return here again!
5
My partner ordered the lamb and I had the quail. I've never had such a perfectly cooked dish. The servers were attentive and polite and knew to have fun with us. I highly recommend you try this. A little more pricey but definitely worth it.
4
Had good pizza for afternoon snacks. Place gets packed and you
May have to wait. I enjoyed my meal here. I will defintely come back here
Again,
4
The food is simple but excellent, the wine list is extensive, and the service friendly and attentive. For good knowledge of the menu and reliable recommendations, ask the men in tux (vs. the waiters without jackets.) The weak link is with the snooty, arrogant people at reception who never smile. Maybe this is due to the confused identity of this place - is it a high-end restaurant or an informal eatery? It aspires to be the former but allows in patrons in shorts and sandals. Contrast with Cut, the steak restaurant a few metres down, definitely a high-end place, where receptionists are professional, curteous and friendly! The informal Pizzeria has unusual and excellent pizzas. It has a more casual menu, but relatively speaking to restaurants in its class, it's even better than the Osteria
3
Having enjoyed one of the best Italian feasts ever at Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles, I have to say I was expecting more from the outpost in Singapore's Marina Bay Sands. While the service was splendid, the food was underwhelming for the most part. A serve of pasta with butter and sage sauce was particularly disappointing. I expected the butter to be nut brown and the sage to be crispy - as I've had many times with this dish around the world. The butter was a greasy pool and one soggy sage leaf was on the plate. Another dish of bucatini all'Amatriciana was also unremarkable - surprisingly for Singapore the level of chilli was barely noticeable and the most dominant flavour on the plate was the fresh parsley thrown in at the end.
2
Responding to some extremely lofty claims in recent advertising literature, we ventured to 'Pizzera Mozza' with expectations commensurately high. And why shouldn't we?In a nutshell: cocktails 4/5; food 2/5; service 2/5; ambience 3/5; value for money 1/5; over all 12/25 or 2.4/5.In detail:The staff at the reception were efficient enough, if a little inattentive. Having not made a reservation we were happy to be offered 'bar seating'. Despite a proliferation of waiters and waitresses (I counted twelve in our area alone) there was some confusion over who was taking our order. We knew what we wanted so ordered everything together. The cocktails arrived in good order, and the raspberry Mojito was very good; not blown by the raspberry and a strong enough hint of mint. A 'complimentary' Parmesan cheese crisp accompanied the cocktails. We ordered a buffalo mozzarella with roasted tomatoes and a green pesto drizzle antipasti. The ingredients used for this were not of the highest quality, the mozzarella being quite bland and the tomatoes being flavour-free – only the freshest, organic products should be used for this. For the main, lasagna and a Parma ham, rocket and Parmesan pizza were ordered. The lasagna was presented in the manner of a school dinner: a collapsed, stratified cube with no accompaniments. The lasagna was extremely disappointing in every respect: I would question if the meat was fresh, and if the sauce was freshly made. The pizza arrived with no Parmesan. I was not offered black pepper. I asked for both – three times - and in the time it took for them to arrive, the pizza was cold. When the Parmesan did arrive it was ground Parmesan, not of good quality (I would guess from a packet). At this price point I should expect high quality, shaved Parmesan for my pizza.And then the bill: SG$169. Wow! I can tell you what you are NOT paying for and that is quality of food and standard of service. I SUSPECT what you are paying for is 'location, location, location' – in that proportion.Very disappointing, especially considering the hype! There are far better pizzas in town

Attracted by the reputation of Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles I wanted to try the Singaporean branch for a long time. Had dinner at the bar, nice set up and environment. It starts with a very attentive staff, whom soon become too attentive and shows their main purpose is to sell, too pushy for asia, despite declining on the first time, have been offered 4 times the additional white truffle for the extra 40$. I started with an excellent artichoke venetian (22$) which I reckon was very nice. Meats and primi were showing totally insane prices so I settled for a plate of tagliatelle with oxtail ragout (60$) which proved so salty I could not eat half of the plate (no one asked me if there was any problem). Wines per glass starts at 19$ and go up to 40. Morality, a 140$ bill for a starter and the most expensive inedible pasta I ever had, plus permanent harassment from the staff. With high prices, comes high expectations and if they surely meet it for the show, they definitively don't for the food
4
We booked for dinner and had a few drinks at the bar before hand. Bar staff were very friendly and helpful. Once shown to our table I found the waiter a little pushy when suggesting courses. The prices are quite expensive and I felt pressured into ordering larger and more courses than needed. However the food is fantastic and worth the cost. The other staff were great
4
Having lunched at Pizzeria Mozza, this time round I went for dinner at the Osteria side. Called earlier, so got a nice table in the centre of the room. As the evening progressed, the room filled up & the place hummed. Staff seemed well trained & this was a well oiled operation that didn't miss a beat!Started with the Ribbolita which I had assumed was a soup that was made with day old bread. What I got was something more delicious, a patty which was fried till a crust formed. There were carrots, swiss chard or cavalo nero & lots of flavor. Added to this was a nice grating of parmigiano reggiano. Had a glass of Joe Bastianich's own label red (merlot/cabernet blend from Fruili) & was pretty much satisfied.Pasta course was tagliatelle with oxtail ragu - this sums it all up for me. Tasty, gorgeous comfort food & the small portion was just right. Again with a nice grating of romano, this was hard to beat.My main was a pan roasted sea trout served on a bed of lentils & topped with a tasty mix of red cabbage & parsley. I ordered a side of fragola, which is a barley like grain that had a pleasing sourness to it as it was cooked with cherry tomatoes & red wine vinegar. I was very pleased as the server recommended that the dish be cooked till just moist. He explained some guests liked it cooked till well done, rendering the fish dry. This was perfect.Dessert was olive oil cakes served with a olive oil gelato. It was just right & not too sweet. I did not eat the rosemary brittle that topped this dessert.Again a winner with excellent service from my waiter who also asked if I had any food allergies, which not many restaurants do. Experience was marred by the nasal twang of a Chinese American woman next to me. Instead of enjoying the food & ambience, she complained to her companion that she couldn't understand why the restaurant was situated in a mall (hello? Marina Bay Sands wasn't just any old mall if you even want to call it that). Some people are never satisfied. I would definitely returns as this was my fourth time
1
Stopped by to check out menu and restaurant and was going to book until interacted with Owen Manager who had bad vibe and bad attitude so passed on it. Owners should consider more hospitality for managers l. Lost business of me and my friends because of this. I encourage owners to get in touch with me as me and my friends can be frequent big spending clients but only with hospitable management thank
4
I love the pizza! I definitely look forward to going back again. But remember to reserve seats, else you'll never find a space!
4
Just wanted a quick meal so ate at the bar. Great food and service. Was good value for money when looking for a simple meal
4
It is not cheap but food is good and drinks are great. Staff is wonderful and friendly. Need to try the burrata as it is great. I didn't have any wine so can't comment on the availability and choices.

For pics and an in depth review, please visit my blog: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/osteria-mozzaMy husband and I are obsessed with Mozza (both Pizzeria & Osteria). Believe us when we say that it offers some of the freshest, tastiest pasta in Singapore! We even went to Italy recently and were craving Mozza back in Singapore (how sad are we??). I'd highly recommend ordering the Potatoes & rosemary along with the Orrecchiette with swiss chard and sausage. Both dishes are delectable. Another great thing about Mozza is the service is absolutely impeccable and the staff are very attentive and go above and beyond to serve you. My only gripe is that the restaurant is situated within a mall, so quite often you look out of the restaurant and are hit with the harsh reality of people in Birkenstocks, crocs and action sandals. Read more about the yummy dishes available at my blog above

A beautiful restaurant with great service!Food was good and really loved the gnocchi. The staff were courteous and pleasant to deal with. Prices are understandably on the high side, considering the dining experience and location. The restaurant share the same entrance with Pizzeria Mozza and is located directly opposite the Mastercard Theatres.Yes, do make a reservation for your meal, or you may have to seek alternatives when you don't get a table, or if you don't mind the bar
5
I walked into Osteria Mozza on a whim, and asked to be seated at the counter. The excellent staff were helpful with their suggestions on how to make the most of the menu, even though I was dining alone. The lardo pizza was light and delicious, and I would definitely eat the bone marrow again! Also had one of the best cannoli ever - best eaten with your fingers, which the staff happily encouraged!More at http://picksandpecks.blogspot.com/2013/06/review-osteria-mozza.htm

This is a serious restaurant with serious prices but if you want quality food and wine this is a great choice. It's in the Marina Bay conference and shopping centre so it feels a bit weird if you're facing out to a bunch of shoppers browsing in Hermes and Prada, but if you're looking inwards you soon focus on the service and the food. Absolutely top end and thoroughly recommended
4
Sat at the counter top and ordered a cocktail each they were gorgeous if not a bit stronger than we were expecting proving that they don't skimp on the sprits like a lot of places. My husband and I order one Mozzalla dish and one Burrata dishes they were both full of flavour and much bigger than a starter size, due to this we both ordered the pasta dishes in the smaller size. I ordered the clam linguine and my husband had the goats cheese ravioli both were very well present and the flavours were well balanced but I did have food envy with the goats cheese dish.They made me an Affogato even thought its not on the menu which was a nice touch. Through out the staff were attentive with out being intrusive, the service was impeccable and they all had time to have a conversation about the food and wine choices. Great night out
5
We chose to eat here on the first night of our Honeymoon whilst wandering round the Bay Sands area. Although packed and buzzing, we were seated almost immediately at the bar with a great view of the room. We ordered two simple pizzas and a couple of beers, they arrived pipping hot in good time and were perhaps the best pizza we had ever tasted (And trust me, my wife knows her Pizza!). The funniest thing about it though was the overall experience of sitting in an Italian Pizzeria, in Singapore, with British and American rock hits from the 70s and 80s playing in the background (including Alice Cooper's "Poison"! Honestly, you can't make this up!). The staff were fabulous and we had great chit chat with the Manager. They looked after us really well
5
The Al Fungi Misti crust was soaked in heavy Olive and garlic soaked pizza with smoky flavour, it even penetrated the vainty takeaway box. It even glistened deliciously under the lights of Osteria Mozza. Chicken wings alla diavolo was also tasty sourish spicey of the stone oven baked kind with a hint of little bit seared. I wish i could come back more often, i'l just have to chalk up more Casino points
5
The menu is stunning here... Even though this is inside a shopping centre the ambience is like an classy American bar..... Beautiful dark wood... Ou can even sit at the bar too.... Lovely cocktails too.... Could eat here every week and would not get bored
4
The pizza is good, it was done well except tht the side crust is a little harder than I like it but I do admit the dough is interesting. Mozza caprese is a must try!! For a first Timer - it is nice and service is up to expectation!
4
One is spoilt for choices at this joint for wines...unfortunately same cannot be said of the food....Although the arrangement of the hotel and the ambience is top class...the food needs to improve..The service is good and I will advise wine connoisseur to visit this join
3
Perhaps it was the hype and expectations that led to the disappointment. Felt that reception was lukewarm, though friendly and professional. Wait staff didn't seem to knowledgeable to of their menu, until the supervisor came to the rescue. For the kind of price, we were expecting to be wowed with the food, but came out blah. It was ok, but definitely not sated. There is no reason for second visit
4
This review is for the pizzeria side of Mozza where I had lunch recently. I opted to have two small anitpasti as starters - the cauliflower fritti with spicy aioli & the calamari al forno. Both had great flavors - the cauliflower fritti was light like tempura & the aioli complimented it nicely. The oven baked calamari was served with cannellini beans was delicious although it had a slight chewy texture. This is the danger with squid as it can so easily overcook.For the main I opted for the lamb shank which was the special of the day. It was well cooked & fell apart & came on a bed of creamy polenta & a fresh perky salsa verde. Shame the wait staff served it when I was having my antipasti. I had to send it back till I had finished my starters.Dessert was a nectarine crostada served with a dollop of thick cream on the side. Well baked with nice crumbly pastry & not overly sweet as that would have killed things.This restaurant specializes in wood oven baked pizza but I decided to give it a miss this time round - if you're visiting for the first time, you cannot go wrong by ordering one of these beauties. Just gives another reason to return
5
Begin with a Singapore Sling; the barman will prepare it in front of you and, if asked, will even teach you how to make this precious drink.The mozzarellas are a must, I would suggest the caprese salad as a starter.As a primo piato, I asked agnelotti with a butter and sage sauce (hummmmm incredible filling).The secondo was the Wagyu Tagliata: one of the best meat dishes I have ever had.Good Luck
5
When we had the opportunity to eat in this restaurant while in Singapore, we did not have second thoughts of dining here. Although pricey, the premium and pleasurable Italian food experience was all worth it. Food is carefully prepared and cooked. My family loved their brick-oven pizza Margherita, lasagna and selection of antipasti of Mozzarella di Buffala and prosciutto. Seated on the bar section, it was also a cultural learning for my boys who liked the idea of having their pizzas prepared before them
3
I have been a great fan of Ms Silverton and Mr Batali’s cooking and had been looking forward to dine in this Singapore outlet, as my travel itinaries have limited me from visiting the original Mozza on Melrose. I own the book and cooked several recipes from it myself.We were seated on the barstools, with a great view of the pizza ovens. The music was loud (too loud?!), the place was buzzing, we were ready for a great night. But that didn’t happen.The tri-colore salad was a mountain of salad and very tasty, the meatballs were a tad try and not as flavorful when I made them from recipe in the book. Also three meatballs is a small portion taken into account the price as well as the fact that Ms Silverton herself mentions that a serving portion is “5 meatballs”.Service was erratic and non-responsive, our pizza (fennel sausage and leek) was undercooked and even we put the uncooked pieces of dough in front of the cooks’ noses preparing the pizza, there was no response. The dispatcher/chef at the bar was only dispatching, never did she taste, never did she look at some of the work that was done by the pizza cooks, even after we complain to management, no action was taken in the prep or were pizzas more thoroughly examined before being expedited. When a manager did check-on us (about 15 minutes after we were done, and gave up trying to get attention), we were offered desserts and coffee. I ordered the Butterscotch Budino (which tasted wonderful) as well as a cappuccino, both appeared on the check. With the check there was a “comment form”, however it was offered without a pencil (if you want feedback, at least provide this, or don’t offer the comment forms…) No response was given on the form, I am also still awaiting the newsletter
5
This is my third visit in Mozza's and I can confirm that they prepare the best pizza around the city. Although it takes a little but to eat after your order, the waiting time is completely justified by the excellent taste of the pizza. Coffee is great too. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is from another planet... I will get back here every time I will pass from Singapore
5
I was alone so had the bar sit and was warmly greeted by the friendly bartender Mr Faizull, didn't know much about the Menu so ask for recommendation, gladly Faizull recommend me the Chanternelle pizza and a nice glass of Wine to pair with the food and for dessert will be the Banana gelato pie. The pizza and the dessert were really good and the wine went really well with the pizza. Had a great time at Mozz and definitely will be back for more, Faizull is a great staff who knows the menu and know how to take care his Guest, cheer
5
Such a good pizza and a really efficient staff. A family safe place and good option with some varied choice of pizza, rather then you run of mill soggy pizza. Highly reccomend this place.
5
Nice dishes, not the typical spaghetti bolognese but fresh and refreshing new to me, ingrediënts. Not cheap but worth the experience, both for the food and the interior of the restaurant.
5
This fun and affordable Osteria serves up delicious pizza! The service was great, and a good place to eat before attending a performance at the Marina Bay Sands Theatre...just a minute walk to the Theatre.
4
Lunched at the pizza counter since the restaurant was rather full. Was immediately offered a menu featuring great choices. Had one pizza with goat cheese, fennel and bacon. The service matched the food, both were great. Worth stopping by when shopping at MBS.
5
We had lunch here. Not cheap, but well worth it. We had Calamari for entrée and a Pizza for main. The food is excellent and the service was great. Would recommend this to anyone.
4
The famed resto by Chef Mario Batali at the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. The servers were very nice and accommodating, food was great too. Oh the dessert, ahh to die for!!
5
Having been to Sky 57 at the Marina Bay Sands for my wife's birthday last year , and being served what I can only call a crappy overpriced meal I was somewhat skeptical to eat at Marina bay Sands Again.However as we were going to see "The Phantom of the Opera"we had tight time restraints so I took a chance.Arrived without a booking at 6pm and was given a choice of a few good tables. Might add here that the place was chokka an hour later.We were served by the assistant manager Naghen Retnavalu who recommended a cocktail both for myself and my wife. By the way we were celebrating our 41st wedding anniversaryWe took him up on his recommendations and they were excellent. I in fact called him over toask him if they measured the tots because they were not shy on the alcohol I thought I was in Thailand.We had a two starters, Calamari, and Belgian endive which we shared. Now I make a pretty mean Calamari and always dubious when ordering it in a restaurant. It was the best I have had in a restaurant. The endive was very good as well.My wife had the sea trout which she had never had before. Hello!! it's another name for Salmon.But it was well prepared and was delicious. I had the Tagliatelle with an oxtail ragout which was likewise very good.No time for dessert or coffee as we had to go to the show.All through the meal the waiters were attentive without being in your face.Naghen Retnavalu the assistant manager gave us great service. We will go again. SOON!
1
2 pizzas, one water and two espresso for 100Sing (60€)!They use canned tomato paste for pizzas. We both had a stomach pain soon later and the day after.Pizzas had a strong chemical taste. This Americans have no idea how to make Italian pizza. Newer again
4
mozzarella menu was a cheese lovers dream, choose 1 or 2 dishes from here alone. cocktail aperitif's were lovely, most dishes were divine, the only dish I was disappointed with was the gnocchi with mushrooms, I would rate this at average only, the gnocchi were ok but cooked with asian mushrooms - the flavours just didn't match well, however they were still edible just not entirely to my taste. Everything else was wonderful.

After living in Italy for 7 years, and then moving to Singapore, my family and I have been on a 3-year hunt for authentic Italian food. Italian cuisine that has not been corrupted by fusing it with the common trend of overly spicing dishes to cater to the local taste bud that tends to enjoy their chili heat more than they care to actually taste the intricate elements of the dish. We are happy to say that Osteria Mozzo provides that experience. Osteria Mozzo offers a selection of authentic Italian flavors and dishes that are elevated, which is why the prices are high—in order to maintain the quality of products used to prepare their menu it will obviously cost more. The staff is superb at being attentive to the customer’s needs—refilling water glasses, wine, replenishing bread, and, overall, making sure your experience is topnotch. Since we were attending a theater production, we chose our antipasti, primi, and dolci from their theater menu, which contains selections that are also found on their normal dinner menu as well. The chef sent over a tasting sample, which contained fresh bufala ricotta—warm, creamy, and delicious. I chose the bufala ricotta with caramelized radicchio, spiced walnuts, honey & fried rosemary. I generally have reservations when I see the word “spiced” next a food selection at any restaurant here in Singapore, because that generally means “extremely overpowering heat that kills all other flavors of the dish”. However, the honey spiced walnuts were so delicately spiced that I could just snack on them. The heat is pleasant and hits the back of your tongue in such a way that you still can taste every other element used in this dish—the sweet, the tangy lemon, the creamy buttery flavors of the cheese, and the earthy piney essence of the rosemary, all on top of four toasted rounds of bread. This was a wonderful way to start a meal.Next, I selected Garganelli with ragù Bolognese. I felt my eyes just wanting to tear up from nostalgia—this dish just brought me back to Venezia (Venice) and to the quaint ristoranti (restaurants) I came to love and learn about the wonderful flavors of authentic Italian cuisine. Osteria Mozza has Bolognese done right! It is hearty robust flavors—comfort food.For my dolci selection, I went simplistic and had a serving of Olive Oil Gelato. I have had this before on the Pizzeria side of this restaurant and it is my absolute favorite flavored gelato—olive oil gelato—this really should not work, but it does. It is not too sweet and the creaminess of the gelato base really takes the olive oil flavor well. Then it is drizzled with more olive oil and sprinkled with a little bit of sea salt, which yields to this neat savory sweet experience. I highly recommend giving this dessert or the Rosemary Olive Oil Cake with Olive Oil Gelato a try—it will not disappoint. The wine selection is fantastic, and offers customers the opportunity to learn and understand wines from different regions of Italy and more.I noticed several complaints about portion size at Osteria Mozza. This is an Italian restaurant that is attempting to bring you an authentic experience. The majority of restaurants in Italy have a menu that is organized into “plates” (courses)—there are several plates that can be eaten in one dinning experience. The portions are small because they want you to experience them all, without becoming over-stuffed. By the end of an authentic Italian meal, you will and should experience foods from all the major food groups, and you should not walk away feeling bloated and disgustingly full. If you properly go through each course that Osteria Mozza has available, you will be pleasantly satisfied. Heck, I only had three of the courses in that come with the theater menu and I was completely full and satisfied. Osteria Mozza is elevated and upscale authentic Italian cuisine.Osteria Mozza helped me embrace my memories of Italy—thank you

Went to the pizzeria attached to the restaurant. Yummy pizzas and generally helpful service although it would have been nice for us (3) to receive our drinks at the same time and both pizzas a once.
3
I was really excited to try one of Mario Batalli's resto but it didn't lived up to expectations. It's not bad...but it's not spectacular either. The pizza was good but it still missing something...and I can't put my finger on it.
5
Unbeliveable food from slow cook octopus for 6 hours that taste like chicken to homemade delicious mozzarella infusions. A must stop by while at MBS
5
We ordered a pizza with broccoli on top. The broccoli was kind of new to us as a topping for Pizza. But coupled with the thin crispy crust & a subtle layer of cheese, it tasted fantastic. We ordered Prawns Al forno+ potatoes in red sauce as starters which was fantastic. The salad, the drinks (green apple ice tea was very fresh) & the dessert (Butterscotch - seasalt budino) were nice too. Nice ambience & good service. The cheese for the pizza toppings varied & though initially we felt it was too less for a pizza, we realised it added a subtle elegance to the taste. The freshly made tomatoe sauce for the starter was great. And very unique mix with potatoes. Overall a nice dining experience.

We were told this was the best Italian to eat at but we found it bland and uninviting. The staff were obviously too busy by too many tables and the pizzas were doughy and lacked toppings. I would not recommend eating here if youre from Europe, as pizza express is far far better
4
We ignored all the effusive comments about Osteria as couldnt stand the idea of eating in a mall (despite that being quite a limiting criteria in SG!). Eventually we tried to pizza half with the children and were so impessed. Excellent, thin crust pizza (best in SG) and amazing service. Spills, special requests all handled with charm. We then went (sans children!) to the Osteria Mozza and already planning return visit. Mozzarella options were as superb as you would expect, pasta delicious and many more than the usual fare. Completely forgot we were in a mall - large open windows and high ceilings gave a feeling of openness. Interestingly service was better in the pizza half, but a great experience
4
An amazing selection of cheese dishes! The mozzarella bar was fantastic! Definitely have the beetroot and horseradish burrata - it is excellent. Even the basic salad is very fresh and nice. The mains were very good - I recommend the ricotta gnocci. The wine selection was excellent. This place is a little pricy but definitely worth going to - was very nice for a first evening in Singapore

I was really excited when we were able to make reservations for our anniversary, especially after reading that this restaurant was listed as one of the top 50 in Asia. I have to say I was disappointed when I walked up and saw it was in the mall with no view, and dress was more casual than dressy. I thought it was in the Marina Bay Sands hotel. What really threw me for a loop at this Italian cuisine restaurant is they play rock and roll music?! I love rock n roll but not for a white tablecloth Italian meal. The food is spectacular, but you have to order the double portion just to get a decent amount, and at $60 for pasta, you should be full when you walk out! The best thing about this place is the service is impeccable! A+ for that
3
We visited Mozza without a reservation and could only get seats at the bar which was not too much of a problem as it wasn't crowded or noisy there. When we ordered out drinks, they gave us these cheesy crisp bread triangles which were really tasty. I ordered the lentils with olive oil fried egg for a starts which was really full of flavor and my fiance ordered the calamari which was also really good. When it came to our pizzas, I had the Bacon, salami, fennel sausage, pancetta, tomato & mozzarella. Which for me had too much tomato and not enough cheese. The fennel sausage, which is their own recipe, was ok at first but then the fennel became a bit too over powering. The base was really good though. My fiance had the Burrata, slow roasted tomato & Sicilian oregano, neither of us had eaten burrata before and it was quite a strange consistency being made from mozzarella and cream. For me it was the same as the one I had ordered with too much tomato and not enough cheese. I would go again but next time I would opt for the restaurant next door rather than their pizzeri

My girlfriend and I dined at this restaurant last week and would not recommend it to anyone. We were very excited to try this place because we have heard so many great things, one the five Celebrity Restaurants in Marina Bay Sands, one of the Asia's 50 Best Restaurant 2013, "created" by the famous Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich and Nancy Silverton... ... but this restaurant simply did not live up to our expectations. The food and wine was great, really authentic Italian, very tasty and well served but the service was terrible: Firstly the waiter brought and showed the wine bottle, after we confirm it he disappeared and brought the bottle already opened to the table. Then we had our "antipasto" without bread even though we asked many times. Our water or wine glasses were never refilled, we had to ask 2 or 3 times for it. We also waited a lot for having the check.We left the feedback card to the manager but it seems he was too busy to reply us...What a let down!!Luc

I would rate it my best italian dining beside portofino (venetian macau). From te bread, tasting menu and of course, the moscato. Very attentive service....
5
You should try the Osteria for many reasons:
- great location in the new busy vibrant Marina Bay shopping complex.
- smart decor with good atmosphere
- excellent, authentic Italian food
- extensive wine list catering for all budgets
- reliable and friendly staff/service
4
The quality of food is excellent but you pay every penny of it! We tried pizza anf lasagna and was good. They even have moretti beer which id quite unusual in this part of the world.
4
Good food, great atmosphere but a little overpriced. Will only go back for special occasions... A simple meal for 2 with just an appetizer, 2 small pastas and a glass of wine costed more than $80 per pax.
4
I am a HUGE fan of Pizzeria Mozza in LA, so when I saw that there was a Mozza in Singapore, I thought it would be nice to have one meal that was a taste of home. The service was not great, especially not for a restaurant which primarily caters to a non-resident clientele. The food was very good, just not as perfectly prepared as it always is at the LA location. As there is so much great food in Singapore, I probably won't be making it a point to return here. It's too pricey to justify the extravagance when I can get street food with more unique flavor at a fraction of the cost
4
Odd for Australians to sample fine food in a shopping centre but the Osteria certainly provided very high level cuisine. Absolutely delightful Italian tastes were provided in the degustation menu but portion sixes were too big and it went on for too long. Tasting sizes only should be provided for this type of menu. The early courses were smaller delicate and beautiful flavour mixtures. My partner especially enjoyed the bow-tie pasta in a lighter oil and butter sauce. I had a traditional ragu sauce with spaghetti which was cooked just on the hard side of al dente which was a nice change from pasta cooked a bit too much. The service was excellent and the floor managers imported from Los Angeles were most peasant. The Osteria is a lovely special occasion restaurant

I had a chance to dine in Osteria Mozza together with my Girlfriends last February 2013. Very excited to try, as this is among the five Celebrity Restaurants in Marina Bay Sands.One of the most-recognized and respected chefs in America today, Mario Batali brings the much-anticipated Italian cuisine to Singapore. We ordered Antipasti (appetizer) Bloomsdale Spinach Salad with ricotta salata, pine nuts & marinated white anchovy,Cauliflower fritti and Nancy's chopped salad. For pasta, we ordered Ricotta Gnocchi with chanterelle mushrooms & spinach, Goat Cheese and Eggplant Ravioli with Bianco DiNapoli tomato fonduta. And for the ultimate Itaian experience, pizza: Tomato, Sicilian oregano with extra virgin olive oil.Overall, it was one of the best Italian dining experience. Not to mention friendly waiters and staff! Good thing, our waiter is a Filipino, he made best selections for first-time Mozza diners like us
4
I have eaten at Mozza three times... Every time it is lovely. Pizzas made in a proper pizza oven which always makes them taste better in my opinion. Yes, it is expensive, but always reliable and the staff friendly and helpful. However, I don't like their margaritas... Just something odd about them. In future I will just have a glass of wine
2
This is the 2nd time I have eaten at Osteria Mozza, both occasions for groups of more than 8 persons. My Friend had wanted to celebrate first his wife's birthday and then his and asked me to help him with the booking.The experience starts badly when the phone is answered by staff who clearly think that they are too good to be working at the restaurant and are doing you a favour in attempting to take your reservation. As I was booking a private room I had to sign a two page contract, giving my credit card number and details and confirming that our group would spend a minimum of S$2,000 on the night.As we all drink wine this was not going to be an issue but really, is this necessary ?On arrival we were shown to the room by ice cold staff and sat with our friends. nobody asked whether we wanted a drink to start and after about 10 minutes menus and the wine list came. the list is excellent and extensive. I basically knew what I wanted and ordered a magnum of the restaurants own proprietary red. I tried to discuss this with the sommelier who couldn't even be bothered to smile or get more than a few unintelligible words out. We finished the first Magnum and I wanted to order another and asked for the Sommelier again, who this time didn't even bother to come to our room !!!!The food itself was poor and meat that looked like it had only just stopped breathing was served to us. The 4 women in our group had a hard time in even attempting to eat it.Very sad that in economic times such as now, restaurants still believe that it is the customer who has to feel privileged to eat at their establishment. Sorry but not this customer. I have choices and this will never be mine again

Ok, so everything in Singapore is expensive and probably the most expensive place you can eat is definitely at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. Took two colleagues from the US to Osteria Mozza for a simple meal of pizza and a couple of beers. We were just a little surprised to get a bill of nearly $300. Ok, the review: Pizzas are medium size and pretty good, although a litle on the pretentious side when it comes to the menu selection, but tasty nevertheless. The beers were local brew poured from bottles and about twice the price of what one might pay anywhere else in Singapore. Add $12 for a bottle of water and you start to get the picture. The atmosphere is pretty good, we sat in the open window to the mall and enjoyed the passing pedestrian traffic. The service was excellent and overall the experience was enjoyable, but its still a shock to get a bill like this for what was in effect a very simple meal.If price is no object then go along and enjoy it before or after a show or shopping or just to go somewhere to spoil yourself a little, just be prepared for the bill

Tasty Italian Fare served in a busy busy restaurant bustling with energy! Mouthwatering pizzas and some hot soup are a must have!
4
Oh my goodness, I enjoyed this restaurant! Delicious and unusual pastas, perfectly cooked (although disappointingly my first choice wasn't available); wine beautifully chilled and extremely good; everything really delicious. Even the ambience isn't bad given the location (a super luxe mall - address is The Shoppes, for goodness sake!) But oh my goodness you pay for it. Other clientele are the kind of Marina Bay guests who are in Singapore to throw money around, so expensive smart is the vernacular dress code (smart casual? who are you kidding!). It's the price that takes my rating down a ta

Nice Italian restaurant inside the mall at the Sands. We originally had reservations at Sky 57 on top of the Sands but after 5 minutes decided it wasn't for us (we should have heeded the poor reviews on Tripadvisor).We needed a backup plan and while walking through the mall (and reading the reviews), decided to give Osteria Mozza a try. While we didn't have a reservation, we were given the option when checking in to either go to the more casual pizza side or the more traditional and a bit more formal Osteria side. Take the "formal" with a grain of salt. It's really more of the "non-family" side as the pizza restaurant was filled with families and baby strollers and the Osteria side was filled with couples and business people.Overall a better than expected Italian meal with good service. Prices are on the high side. We each had a salad and a main along with one cocktail and two glasses of wine. Bill came to around $230. I don't mind spending that kind of money so long as the food and service are good (which it was at Osteria Mozza), but the fact that you are in a restaurant who's view is of shoppers in a mall was the one negative. It's ashame this restaurant wasn't one level higher with windows overlooking Singapore Harbor and the city
4
Expect to pay more than your average pizza but this pizza was not the average pizza so worth the tags! The crust was salted, thin & crispy. Our fave is the fungi. Try starter: fried cauliflower, bonne marrow, burrata, mozzarella, chopped salad, squid. Generous brandy on Tiramisu. The restaurant has 2 division: Mozza for pizza lover, open for lunch&diner; the other is Osteria, closer to fine dining Italian food, open only for diner&Sunday brunch
5
This restaurant is one of a number of celebrity eateries in the Marina Bay Sands complex. Sitting on one of the mall's concourses, its more about co-location than location as your view will be of the late night shoppers. However, that is a small downside on what is otherwise a fantastic menu, great service and ingredients from the best places in the world. The decor is quite close and intimate (which further demarcates it from the Mall) but the tables are a good size and the right closeness to your loved one. The sommelier may have been disappointed in our choosing our wine by the glass as a bottle of anything was hugely expensive (although this is more Singapore than just the Mozza).This is one for couples, lovers of fine food and service, and for those wine lovers with a big expense allowance.PS You can charge it back to your room if you stay at MBS Hotel

One half of this place is a pizza place and the other a more traditional Italian restaurant. I don't do pizza so we headed for the other side. I'm ashamed to admit that it was visitors to Singapore who introduced me to this place on my doorstep. It's inside the MBS shopping complex, looking inwards so not exactly a great view. Nonetheless, the food and service more than make up for it. All the dishes our party ordered looked good and tasted better. Staff were extremely knowledgeable on both food and wine but pity they didn't talk me out of the Californian craft beer which didn't rock my boat at all. Some of the piped music was a bit on the loud side and the place was generally quite rowdy but watching some of the food being prepared feet from our table took our minds off it. I will go back and I will take visitors there so I guess it must have left the right mark. Busy place usually, I believe, so reservations recommended
4
We started with drinks at the bar and then were seated for a lovely dinner. Thankfully we did have reservations because this place was full when we left. The portions were fairly small for the price, but I think Singapore is expensive in general. We all (five of us) ordered something different and everything was delicious. We especially enjoyed the side of potatoes. The servers are very knowledgeable about the menu and wine

I heard about this pizzeria from a friend, with whom we are in a search for the best pizza's across cities in Asia.In Singapore, I hadn't had a good pizza yet, since every time I am in town I head to Otto and that satisfies my hunger for great Italian food.This place is one of Mario Batali's establishments, so it has the right pedigree. We had no trouble getting a reservation for the same night, however it was a Monday. Service is great, and the pizzeria itself has a very warm atmosphere. It's next to Osteria Mozza, which is a bit fancier.We ordered some starters ("best garlic bread ever" said my boss) and a pizza each. There are such a wide variety of combinations that you are probably going to be thinking about the ones you didn't order and already plan to come back to try them all.My pizza was great, had a few cheeses on top and was a variation of the quattro formaggi. The crust was the best part, nothing I have experienced before. very crunchy, almost breadlike, not heavy at all.The entire party agreed that the pizza was great. Definitely will come back if pizza is the choice for the evening.The only small thing that bothered me is that you are in a shopping mall, and whilst the pizzeria itself has a good atmosphere, you can't escape the fact you are in a mall
5
As a table of 7 women enjoying a very special birthday, you could not have found a better fitting restaurant for food lovers at heart. We were welcomed warmly and offered drinks at the bar. we had arrived earlier than expected which as of no issue to the restaurant. We decided to indulge in the chefs tasting menu with some beautiful red and white Bastianich wines to top off our meal. From the start to the end each dish was as good and even better than the last. We were so excited to share this meal with one another and the event of the evening was when the head chef came out to greet us
2
This is a very poor Italian restraint . The service was poor, the ambience terrible - loud American rock music, staff more interested in talking to themselves. The pizza was almost inedible, poor base, way too much oil, dried out salami, poor taste. Then to to it off the price is over the top. This so called "celebrity" restaurant is an indictment on the chef/owners
4
OK we shared a pizza, but it was an italian style pizza so very tasty, but minimalist as ordered. Salad also shareed between two and some great coffee. That's all we wanted and that's all you need.
4
High quality Italian restaurant, providing great food and very good service. The pizza's and starters were particularly good.
4
We had lunch here and the food was great. The pizza parma ham was obviously very tasty, But my favourite was the spinach salad.Havent tasted spinach this crispy before! The service was standard and efficient. We would come back just to eat the pizza and the spinach salad. :)
5
superb dining experience. attentive wait staff who helped sped things up as we were running late for a show. the mozarella was fresh, pork chops were beautifully done, the dessert absolutely stunning. All meals in appropriate serving sizes too. highly recommend one try the meat platter and the rabbit
4
This is the place to go if you want to have well prepared italian style pizzas (light on the toppings, good thin crispy crust). Service is ok, although the hostess seemed a little rude and only allowed me a bar seat (I was alone). I would prefer a table, given the S$76 dollars I spent there for a Margherita Pizza and two glasses of a good wine.
4
A fun find in a fun city. I was taken there by a colleague and found the restaurant to be of a great quality in terms of service, and food. Fabulous mussels, and fresh pasta. typical Singapore prices. Is part of a chain but has the unique fee
4
Nice place to kickback and chat, over nice food. Service was very good, service staffs were very friendly and attentive and nice to see them having the positive vibe knowing what to recommend. I had the refreshing Caprese with burrata, cherry tomatoes & basil, excellent and melt-in-your-mouth Grilled Wagyu Beef Tagliata with rucola & Parmigiano Reggiano and finised with the excellent Picolo Budino Caldo di Cioccolato with candied almonds & bourbon gelato.Nice place to hangout with friends, visiting colleagues or even bring a date
4
It was our second visit and we thoroughly enjoyed the pizzas and the rest of the food that comes from a very special oven prepared just right. Much of the ingredients are flown in from Italy.Helpful and friendly staff serve with a smile and make you feel to go again. We will whenever we are next in Singapore, for sur
5
Can't imagine getting the total best pizza of my life in Singapore!! We had lunch in the less formal dining area which is lovely with great service.. The pizza crust is crispy, thin centre with crunchy outside crust.. Had a fresh baby tomatoes with a delish sort of cheese.. there are no pastas in this restaurant.. but for the best pizza, salads.. you must give this a try.. the Shopping centre is amazing as far a the architecture ... the shops are at the very highest end of the shopping spectru
4
We avoid the Marina Bay Sands unless we have a show to see in the theater. Pizzeria Mozza is a good option that is somewhat reasonably priced. The "homemade" fennel sausage is amazing! We basically order whichever pizza has it. Decently priced wine list as well and good service
3
We had dinner on the bar side on night. The food was ok and the service was a little slow at times. There is a good selection of pizzas and the quality was good.
5
We heard a lot about Mario's place, but nothing like the real experience, the pizza is made in heaven! absolutely the best pizza ever, we love this place and certainly we will be the first restaurant we will visit every time we land in singapore!
5
Probably the best italian food in Singapore for an affordable price range. Wether you eat the fine italian meat, pasta or pizza dishes, they are all of outstanding quality,.
5
Heavenly procuitto & Mozzarella
home made pasta (tortellini) fabulous
to die for Choc fondant with caramalised almonds
5
We visited both the Osteria and the Pizzeria during our stay and would highly recommend both.The Osteria is more formal but the food is excellent, the burrata salad with beets was particularly good and my partner thought the pasta with rabbit ragu as good a pasta dish as he had ever eaten. The torta della nonna for dessert was fabulous. Service was very good and attentive.The pizzeria was noisier and full of families eating together which is always good to see. The pizza fungi misti is well worth a try and the service on this side is friendly and efficien
4
This place has great pizza, in particular, they do use fresh mozza cheese which makes this place stand out from all the other pizza places in Singapore. Their salads are also nice and fresh. Great place for coming to dine with friends. The only drawback is that this place is a bit cramped and crowded. And also, I think this place is a bit over priced
5
I review this restaurant every time i visit...it simply doent disappoint ever!!The food is exceptional (best Italian food outside of Italy) the service is simply superior to anywhere ive been in the world, atmosphere is fun and laid back yet you know you are dining in one of the worlds finest...as all my previous reviews suggest...JUST GO!!
5
I visited this restaurant with clients in March and was blown away. Not only is it inMarina Bay Sands which in itself is pretty impressive, but the food was fabulous too. We had 8 people for dinner and chose to share entrees and a main each. We let the waiter organise entrees and antipasti and each dish was amazing from the pasta to the mozzarella. I had the duck for my main which was gorgeous, although I would suggest ordering a side with it. Perfectly crispy skin too! The wine is expensive as with all of Singapore, but our choice of red was perfectly suited to our meal. The wait staff were attentive and looked after us throughout the night. Definitely recommend checking this out when you are in Singapore
2
We have heard great things about the food in Singapore, but our first meal was a disappointment. We went for lunchâ€¦.. My husband had the meatball appetizer, which was pretty good, but his margherita pizza was average and a bit undercooked. I had the spinach salad, which was drowning in lemon dressing and covered with so much shredded cheese that I could not taste the spinach. We also thought the prices were high
5
I went with 8 friends, and ordered a whole bunch of pizza. They were all good! Their secret is having the mozza cheese to make their pizza. Now the store is quite crowded and the tables are too near, so the atmosphere is not the quiet ambience type. Service is okay.. I would rate this place as the best pizza you can get in Singapore (and the most expensive as well)
5
If you're at the Bay mall grab a slice of pizza at Mozza. Amazing and simple food with a great atmosphere and service!
5
Have had several meals here and they have always been a nice experience. All pizza's are excellent, worth the expense. Ambiance is very good. Strongly recommend making reservations before attempting to go.
5
great ambience, good food but ofcourse its pricey like most other celebrity chef restaurants in marina bay sands shopping mall.
5
My husband and I decided to try the Ironchef or Michelin chefs' restaurants during our travels. And we started with this one. We heard that we needed reservations to be sure so we asked our friends from Singapore to book for us a couple of weeks in advance. You don't need to make reservations that early though, I think a few days is fine. My favorite order was the cauliflower fritters. I love cauliflower and the batter tasted great. We also ordered pizza and pasta - I forget the name but the pizza we ordered had a sunny side up egg in the middle and it was damn good. It's expensive, though this isn't surprising. The service was great and this was not surprising too because some of them were fellow Filipinos! I would recommend it to friends to try out, though I won't be going often because of the price
5
Great spot - chef has an amazing place to visit, definitely do the tasting menu for interesting options with the freshest ingredients. Couldn't imagine a better spot in large dining scene at MBS. Enjoy and experience this place over others around. Thank the chef for taking a fine dining restaurant that is not stuffy or pretentious
5
We celebrated our belated valentines day at these beautiful restaurant. From the minute we enter, there were many waiter/ manager attended to us ensuring we are ordering the right food, the right wine...We begun with some on the house yummy cheese appetizers and freshly baked bread followed by our ordered appetizers...it was filled with flavors and quality...im not too sure what we ordered however it was some salad with ham and the grilled octopus...yummy! As for the main course we ordered some grilled beef which is recommended by the chef. Trust me you would not ever regret, ordering such yummy meals! As all our meals came and gone, the waiters and restaurant manager took great initiate to ensure we were comfortable and the food we are indulging is beyond perfection!We felt very welcome and enjoyed our evening....as the main course finishes they recommended scrumptious dessert and for him they offered their specialty drink naming Amaru, a strong liqueur for digestion. Our valentines day could not have been better! We loved the hospitality, we love the ambiance and we strongly recommend everybody to dine and wine and fall in love again in Osteria Mozza @ Marina Bay Sands..
4
We had dinner here in February. When you enter you can choose wheter you want to eat at the Osteria (looks more classy with tablecloth etc) or the Pizzeria (casual style). Since we wanted to eat a Pizza, we chose the Pizzeria. Staff was first friendly and attentive, braught us a bottle of water. When we wanted to order no one was there or did not hear that we were calling them. After a while we finally ordered the Mozza Carpaccio and the Prosciutto Ruccola Pizza.The Mozza Carpaccio was delicious - soft mozarella and basil pesto. When we asked for some bread, the waitress told us, that they don't have bread, just panini and focaccia. Dio mio!!! No plain bread for a salad or appetizer in an Italian restaurant?! The taste of the mozza carpaccio was so good, I did not want to eat it with a chicken focaccia or a ham panini! But when the pizza arrived, the bread problem was forgotten. One of the best pizza I ever had. Thin, a little crispy, not too much cheese, not overloaded, but well covered with cheese, prosciutto ham and ruccola. The tomato sauce was wonderful! Yes, it's not a cheap restaurant, but I prefer eating an expensive and delicious pizza, than being disappointed eating a 2$ pizza-similar bread
4
They have many specials pizza, but you better make a reservation cos they always full house. They have two side, one side for pizza, another side for pasta, you cannot order pizza if you sit at the pasta side, very funny!! So, finally we choose the Pizza side cos we want to try pizza.They will make in front of you if you sit at the bar table, the pizza is thin type, I love it and its yummy to me. I love this place
4
This review is for the Pizzeria section. This is a place to go with friends and family special occasions. Book a table well in advance. The pizzas are great, I recommend the Burata, the sausage and the prosciutto. The meatballs and bruschetta are good appetizers for sharing. Five of us ordered three pizzas. With appetizers and pizzas we were fairly stuffed so did not try the desserts
5
So this is for the pizza section named Pizzeria Mozza. I will dream of this pizza until I have it again. The staff was so friendly and accommodating despite constantly being full. I recommend reservations but did squeeze in a second time without one with luck. DO NOT SKIP DESSERT!!! The Butterscotch Budino is To.Die.For!!! Fabulous restaurant
5
Agree not the cheapest pizza but we thought good quality ingredients were used and we thoroughly enjoyed what we had and felt it was value for money.
Particularly enjoyed the complementary appetiser of crispbreads as it was different from your average bread basket.
5
Best Italian food in Singapore. I prefer the PIzzeria to the Osteria - better vegetarian options. You can not leave without having the peanut butter gelato.
3
This place is very expensive for the food that they serve. Maybe it's just not fit for my taste as my palate is not really sophisticated at all. None the less, it's still expensive.
5
We were a party of 3. We ordered almost everything.
Accompanied by a great Brunello. No need to say much,
except that it was excellent. As we ordered so much, I really
cant describe each and every dish. Must go!
5
Excellent pizza with great atmosphere & service. Located inside the shops at the new Sands Hotel & Casino.
4
Six of us sat and ordered a dish apiece to share, Malaysian style. Mozze lunchtime was full though eventually got a table. Business is clearly good for a Friday before the long Chinese New Year holiday. Salami salad was good, though a shade salty. Green bean salad was tender and crunchy, pizza was excellent as was the Panini sandwich. Free lemon zest water was pleasant. We were all too hungry to comment critically on the food, but it was a good Italian lunch nevertheless. Service was considerate and friendly and fairly efficient. With coffee and one dessert lunch came out to SGD200 after tax, which is not bad considering the location in the Sands Shopping Mall. Would go back

Mozza Pizzeria has really good food, a buzzing atmosphere and an overall good vide. We have enjoyed going there many times. I am not sure if there has been a change in management but the last two times we have been there (within the past month), the service has been so bad that we will not be going there anymore despite my accolades (there are too many other alternatives in Singapore). Last time, we sat for 13 minutes after arriving without being acknowledged at all. Were we not waiting for another couple, we would have left there and then. Also, the main dish was served to us 3 minutes after our starter. When we asked them to withhold the mains (to keep it warm in the kitchen), the waiter sort of argued with us and huffed away like he was being inconvenienced. I have other grievances regarding the service but they all revolve around the points outlined herein: minimal personal attention, and timing of food delivery erratic and not coordinated for all the people at the same table, or worse yet, the sequence of dishes (main dish should arrive when the starter is finished). (Note that I observe this last violation of service in many restaurants in Singapore).My husband and I regularly spend $250 at this restaurant (which includes wine), we won’t be bothering with Mozza any more in a city with so many other great options. But if you don’t mind poor service, then Mozza is really worth it for the food, the ambiance and overall, I think the menu is appropriately priced (which is not to say it is cheap - but I think it matches the quality)
3
We had a meeting overrun till 4pm and this is 1 of the few high end places open at that time for lunch. We ordered a pizza each as they don't serve much else for mains - no pastas or meats. No soup either. The "bread basket" was 4 small pieces of crackers. They did have a nice bacon bruschetta. our Parma ham pizza was ok. My friend's fennel one was average as well. They are thin crust pizzas, and while good, they are many out there just as good. They also had a good Stone beer from California, which is curiously not available on the us east coast but in Singapore. Service was good and friendly in genera
4
Vibrant ambience and great for gatherings with friends or family night out. Sitting at the counter is also fun to watch them prepare the food and pizza.Pizza is well made and I love how the crust is puffed up when its fresh out from oven.A tad expensive and I can get equally great pizza at much lower price.Still it is worth a try
5
It was a Saturday night and we did not have a booking. However we were offered seats at the bar and that turned out to be the making of our night. We were so well looked after by the wonderful Annun who worked behind the bar and he just excels in customer service. The food was oustanding especially the Gnocchi with wild mushrooms which we both had. I have never eaten better Gnocchi and that includes eating in Italy. The dessert of a trio of gelato dishes, well, they were not just your ordinary everyday gelato. I won't spoil the surprise but they were sensational.Later in the night as we were finishing we were entertained by some fellow guests on the merit of various liquers. Quite a few laughs there.S o thank you Annun and other staff for a great night
5
The food at Mozza is authentic, great selection of vegetarian cuisine on the lines of la petit mason....fabulous wine selection....great place and a must go
5
Delicious pizzas , great base. Pricey but worth the money for a good authentic pizza. One pizza, one salad and a bottle of the cheapest red wine all shared between 2 was around 160 Sing dollars!
4
Despite our initial disappointment when we got a table next to the hostess (we did reserve and came 5 min late) the manager moved us to a much better table and had a great dinner. Appetizers are fresh and tasty and the pizza are extremely good. This place is always packed so do make a reservation. Always a trip when I am in Singapor

My wife and I have eaten here twice and on both occasions the place was packed and alive. The appetizers are a must as it will take a while for your freshly-cooked food to be prepared. Fortunately, the staff is always ready to recommend a pizza that will suit your tastes. They let me add meat or extra cheese based on their recommendations, so be sure to let them know what your pizza preferences are. Watching them prepare the dishes from behind the counter is part of the charm, so a seat by the bar when the place is full isn't necessarily a bad thing. I would definitely come back and hope you enjoy your visit here.

Food was good with a very different style pizza, very good taste and food ingredients.Good service and as usual a very good location inside te MBS.But beeing Italian I cannot accept a bill of 400 S$ for 3 pizza, 2 appetizers 1 average wine and water.You would spend 60S$ in Italy and the ingredients are not more expensive in Singapore.We will not go back. Unfortunately

I booked Osteria Mozza a month ago to ensure a table during our short time in Singapore .We arrived on time and our table was not ready..ok ..however we were not offered a drink at the bar .. So we cluttered the entry.. We got to our table and were waited on by expert staff.The menu was superb! I wanted to try everything.It's not very often you see all your Italian favorites put on the same page.Although every item was cooked with a twist. My mouth is watering as I think about it.The wine list was all Italian wine.. And a list of enormous selections.The wine waiter was extremely skilled and we drank very fine wine indeed.We had a sensational night

I do like this restaurant (only been to the pizza side) but when you call to make a reservation they will tell you they are completely booked solid. Just turned up and sure enough three tables were occupied. I don't know if this is their way of not taking reservations but what ever the reason for this strategy, it is quite comical. Pizzas are gorgeous but fairly expensive - upward of SGD25++ each. This is my second time round though and I have to say that they are consistant in quality of food and the service is fairly good once you get in
3
Osteria feels a bit schizophrenic. It is trying to offer high quality cuisine yet appear like a real hustle and bustle bar/restaurant and all at the same time whilst you stare out at the inside of a shopping mall.The food is certainly good and the service is also very good but the ambience suffers badly from the open view out to the shopping centre, it's also incredibly crowded and feels a little claustrophobic as a result.Great food but not the most enjoyable place to have a meal with people at the bar next to you standing right over you.........
4
A little random, you get asked if you want Pasta or Pizza and then you get taken to either the left or right side! You can't have both (I wanted pasta, husband wanted pizza - who'd think it'd be so hard!!!) We were put in this random little wine cellar-y room. The food was delicious though, and the staff very helpful
5
We were looking forward to going to osteria as a highlight of our holiday and it didn't disappoint. We got the full chefs tasting menu with wine pairing and every dish had great Italian flavors which we diligently savored. The highlights of the meal were the simple parmesan and endive salad and mozza dishes. The sommelier was also knowledgeable and the wines were all delicious. Was worth every penny and will definitely be back next time I'm in singapore
5
Second visit to Mozza this time brought my partner along. Atmosphere was cosy, slightly romantic with dimmed lights & candles. Had a serving of pizza & bruschetta. Pizza tasted delicious and impressed the both of us. Loved its reasonably priced pizza with a usual serving for couples would be sufficient. Bruschetta came with massive toppings and tasted real good. Staffs are attentive and friendly. Overall enjoyed my dinner and an inexpensive way to dine in a celebrity chef restaurant to go with its perfect ambience. Nice place and would return again
4
Visited the pizzeria on a Sunday afternoon, busy but a great vibe, quickly attended to by staff. Pizza took a little while to arrive due to busy-ness of venue, but it is worth waiting for, true Italian pizza with loads of cheese and thick, airy crusts. Reasonable price for a pizza to share and a couple of drinks too. A great way to visit one of the celebrity chef venues at MBS without paying a lot

Decided to dine at Osteria on December 2, 2012 after attending a matinee of the Jersey Boys at Marina Bay Sands. While we were in a New York state of mind (or at least Jersey), the atmosphere and layout drew us in. Unfortunately that's where the semblance to New York stopped. Singapore establishments appear to have such a desire to fit in but unfortunately image and reality often don't mix. Where a New York establishment would have edgy service, a vibe, typically great food and family portions that demonstrate value (particularly in Italian restaurants), Osteria Singapore counts none of these qualities. I would suggest Osteria if you are in town attending a conference but beware. It is convenient and with crazy pricing. Service, taste, ambiance, etc will not be on the menu. There are much better Italian restaurants in Singapore. If you are hungry after the theatre, go for the pizza (next door) at Mozza. Loud, vibrant, a bit of a vibe.
4
Do not expect the same quality as Otto in NYC BUT they do a very decent job with the limited Singapore ingredients. I would say its the best pizza place in Singapore. If you love the thin crust with a variety of cheese toppings, this is a must. The best is the one with the burrata. :
5
Firstly, my review would be useful to people who only care about the food, and not how noisy a restaurant can be. This is the best Pizza I've tasted in Singapore! The crust is not too thin and not too thick, it is crispy on the outside but soft and fluffy on the inside, amazing texture. The pizza I had was an all-meat pizza, and I can honestly say the chef was pretty generous with the ingredients as well as the cheese. This a great place to eat with your friends or family. But in Singapore, be prepared to pay for quality. Other than that, great place to go, simply delicious
2
We used to go regularly to Mozza even if the place was noisy when crowded. We were really happy to see the place half empty at 1pm on Saturday. We quickly understood why. The amount of cheese put on their burrata pizza has been divided by 10, the cappuccino doesn't come with shaved chocolate or biscotti anymore. For those who don't like to eat without being able to listen to your friends, you can go there now. For those who like good Italian food, it is time to look for another optio
3
We loved the food. Our starters were the courgette flowers stuffed with ricotta and goats cheese with lentils - delicious, if a little on the small side. We shared 2 pizzas between 3 of us and could not eat it all, but it was exactly what a good pizza should be, with the most delicious, light crust. Sadly, the experience was spoiled by the dreadful noise, so bad that we could not hear each other speak at the table. A combination of hard surfaces, close together tables and loud music made for a really dreadful ambiance. We would have gone back for the food, but unless they do takeaway, we won't be eating Mozza's food again
5
If you love pizza and italian food you MUST visit. Trust me you wont be disappointed. Even if you have to wait for a table it will be worth your while. We dropped in mid afternoon for lunch and the pizzeria was crowded and bustling. My first thought was that we would be here for the long haul so i ordered some cocktails to get us by. We didn't have to wait long before our starters were in front of us. The mozzarella salad was amazing, as were the arancini balls and lets not forget the raspberry mojitos! Our pizza arrived not long after we had finished the starters. THE best pizza i have had, crispy base and crust with the most delicious offerings of meat slices. Totally scrumptious. The food was a little on the pricey side, but so worth it for the taste sensation. We can not wait to try out the restaurant next time we are in Singapore, my mouth is watering already
4
Came here during lunch time and waited for a bit since it was quite a busy hour.Service was quite slow, but understandable due to the high volumes of ppl. Food was great. The pizza was crisp and done to perfection and the chicken wings we ordered were wonderful too. Ordered the pizza with parma ham and rocket as well as the vegetarian pizza.Price was a bit steep for your average pizza but definitely worth it
4
Attended a conference at the casino, a few colleagues decided on Italian for dinner so we were directed to Osteria. Visually, it is a great looking restaurant split into casual and fine dining. Wine selection is extensive to say the least, although lacking some variety. The food, i've dined at Batali restaurants around the world, Singapore doesn't disappoint if you stick with the basis pizza and pasta items, the other dishes were not that inspiring. Given the amount of diners that night (packed), service was good
4
Went to osteria mozza, food portion was very generous, great selection of wine and food. Service was good, pasta was great but steak was just average.
2
good appetizers but pizza was simply tasteless. thin pizza dough looked nice but the taste was far from good Italian pizza...net, if they can't get the basic right rest does not matter.
net, pick up a different place. there are plenty in the mall.
5
We had a special family meal at 'Mozza' and sought the advice of a young Las Vegas Somelier/Manager who was looking after us on the evening. He recommended the most unusual and inspiring food and wines and we had a gourmet evening to remember. My wife , teenage children and I all had multiple courses of pasta , seafood , the house special mozzarella platter , and deserts and all said this was one of the best Italian meals we'd ever had - what a pleasant and unexpected surprise 
5
This restaurant was certainly a 5 star experience. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. We sat at the mozzarella bar which was great because you can watch them prepare all of the salads and appetizers. The cheese selection was outstanding and I have never had a better salad!Although this restaurant is pricey, I think it's definitely worth it
5
Prior to leaving the Philippines I had read up on Mario batalli's resto at the Shoppes in Marina Bay Sands. It recommended getting reservations which I had not done as I didn't really know how our days would go. But we did manage to get a table sans a reservation and service was quite quick, possibly a 20 minute wait for the pizza. Wait was much shorter for the crispy duck with lentils which was the dish for the day and the meatballs appetizer. Even much earlier we were served pizza toasts that were very good.The resto opens at 12 noon and we were seated after less than five minutes of waiting .The price for lunch here was a third of dinner's at Cut. Shorts are allowed .

...that's amore! Mozza pizzeria has the best pizza in Singapore and is one of the best pizzas I have eaten anywhere in the world. Sometimes I just crave pizza and the only place that can satisfy that craving is Mozza. Their pizzas are thin, with the perfect crust and crispiness and they offer several unique and tasty toppings. I love their funghi one and the one with big balls of sausage. Usually our meals at Mozza consist of a bottle of wine, an appetizer, two diversepizzas and a salad. It is a beautiful lunch or dinner. However, if you are originally from outside Singapore, the price is outrageously high. I could enjoy a similar meal in the US, Canada or Europe for half the price, if not less. However, I am not living in those areas anymore, I am living in Singapore, and I am willing to pay the premium for great pizza in Singapore. Their sister restaurant, Osteria, next door, is also good and owned by famous chef, Mario Batelli. He does great pizza and pasta
5
This was a spur of the moment choice of restaurant as we had forgotten to prebook anywhere. On a Saturday night we were lucky to get a table, and gratefully accepted seating at the bar. From the moment we entered the restaurant I loved the ambience and the buzz. There is an extensive menu with some great choices; we thought the food was excellent and we also enjoyed the best bottle of wine of our holiday. The staff were efficient, knowledgeable and friendly, attentive without being intrusive. I would love to go back - or better still, perhaps they could open up in my home town of Edinburgh
3
Tasty pasta. be careful about the sizes though. It comes in small appetizer portion or a full size portion. I ordered the small ravioli before and it came with 5 pieces, so this time I decided to have the full size. It was for a family of 3 with over two dozen ravioli bits. Don't know why I kept on eating and eventually finishing it.I did not try the pizzeria but a friend says it is better than the osteria
4
The menu is high-brow Italian as you should expect if you know Mozza or if you did any research! Which we did not! We came with my 12 year old daughter and her 9 year old friend and once we saw the menu we thought this was going to be a "FAIL". In fact, there was nothing on the menu that the girls could understand! And very little that we could understand either! However, all turned out very well. The ambience is very relaxing. Dark wood and a gorgeous long winding bar. Really, impecable service, which is not always the case in Singapore - even in fine dining. There was a delicious complimentart starter of light cracker with light cheese and herbs. THe mozzarella and tomato salad was the best I have ever had. Wine sommelier was spot on. His choice was perfect. In the end the children has Spaghetti Bolognaise! But it was very special! Ragu made from pork and veal in a rich sauce. We had the leg of lamb which was stunning. Overall the experience was one of the best in Singapore. Would have been an "Excellent" rating but perhaps slightly over priced
4
Excited to try this the first foray of Chef Batali in Singapore (Babbo is among my favorite restaurants in NYC). It did not disappoint. Fantastic pizzas in the New York style (thin crust). Also try the fried cauliflowers - heart attack on a plate but you'll die happy. Next time I want to go back and try the restaurant side (do note they don't serve pizzas on the formal side)
4
We've eaten at the pizzeria and the osteria and both are great. A large choice of antipasti and very good pizza.
1
Tiny Portions, Hefty prices and to Top all Off, our 5year Old Asket for Extra Penne since the frist Portion was Even for her too small we Ended up paying TWO fully prices dishes, 28 SGD each!!!
3
Food is ok, atmosphere quite italian, nice to get the european feeling once again as expat. However, everything is soaked in oil, less would be more!!
4
This resteraunt is primary for pre-theatre guests, however I chose to visit for Sunday lunch during my down time in Singapore. The atmosphere was lively with multinational patrons. Pizzas are all artisan and can take up to 45 minutes to make so bear this in mind. You can be seated opposite the Pizza makers which is quite entertaining. Staff are very good and always making sure that everything is in order and if they can be of further assistance.Food is simple and tastey and I would recommend that if you are looking for a quick bite whilst in the Shoppes Marina Sands, you can't go wrong with Mozza
4
We found this Pizzeria Mozza, owned by the famous New York chef Mario Battali and his partner Joe Bastovic in this busy shopping mall on Marina Bay Sands. It seemed to be a popular spot for visitors and we were lucky to get seats at the bar table on a Saturday night. The restaurant has a cosmopolitan vibe. We were facing two giant wood fire ovens and it was interesting to see the chefs making our pizza.We ordered the clams and calamari as the starters. Both were very delicious and made in the oven. As for the pizza, we had the classic Parma ham, rocket and tomato sauce. It was very crispy and had a great fresh taste. We concluded that it was the best pizza we had for a long time! The desserts were the coconut/lime pie and gelatos (plum, rum raisin and banana). They were great too!The service was also very good! Our waitress was friendly and always checked on us.We cannot wait to come back again for our next visit to Singapore
5
We dinned at Osteria Mozza, which is the sister restaurant and shares the same entry as Pizzeria. We arrived without a booking and as a result had to sit at the bar for our dinner (so you better book unless you are happy on a bar stool) which for my wife and I is actually a bit of fun, as you can watch the chef's crew at work slicing and dicing Prosciutto or vegies and also see what everyone else is eating at the tables below while you sip some wine and eat away. The food was really unexpectedly superb and full of mouth watering taste sensations and we cleaned up every crumb of Burrata and Burricotta and Pasta sauces of the plates. The Wine and Bar selection is extensive and I did need the help of the sommelier as I really didn't know many of the wines and didn't want to guess at those prices. The Wine recommendation turned out to be just about right, so we were happy. It was all over much too soon, so we were happy that the barman took the initiative to come over to drag us closer to his section of the bar and forced us to try his coctails for desert which was a nice finish. What a great night of food and fun it turned out to be for us and the whole crew at Osteria Mozza deserve our compliments. Singapore has many restuarant choices so if you are after something cheap don't go to Osteria, as it's not hawker store prices, however, life is too short to eat poor quality ingredients just because they are cheap. We will be back gain as it is worth it. Well done and please keep it up for my next visit

Actually, my wife and I agreed that our pizza at Mozza was BETTER than the pizzas we have had while traveling throughout Italy. We have eaten pizza in nearly every region of Italy, including Pizzeria Brandi, where they made the first margherita pizza. The pizza we were served at Mozza was better tasting than those we have had before!Even without a reservation we were able to get in for a table for two for an early dinner, around 5pm. We decided to order one pizza and one panini and share so we could try more than one thing. We ordered the pizza with bacon, salami, fennel sausage, etc. and the mortadella, prosciutto, salami, and aged provolone panini. The panini was above average, a little on the smaller side. The pizza was absolutely incredible. With the first bite we looked at each other and knew what the other was thinking. This pizza was even better than the ones from Italy. They are thin crust and use a traditional wood burning oven and obviously very fresh ingredients. The pizza was cooked perfectly and even though we were full, we finished everything just because we wanted to keep tasting it! I highly recommend the pizza, and the serving is really one pizza per person as the crust is very thin and are a little smaller than the traditional Italian pizza (way smaller than an American style pizza). But this is about quality over quantity, which we appreciated.Everything else about our dinner was great. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I don't know if it normally this way, but we had 3 or 4 different servers come by throughout the meal. Not overbearing though, it was nice to make sure everything was right. I also ordered the mint basil lemon ice tea and it was really nice, I only wish it had been bigger because it was so good. The price is a little high for pizza, but it's worth the splurge for something really quality
2
Went to the Pizzeria with my wife. The bill was north of SGD 100 for a pizza, a panino, some olives and a bottle of water. The marketing is that the pizzas are exceptional. They really are not. Olives al forno was a waste. It is just some olives put in the oven and should be given for free not charged at SGD 15.Better of going next door to the DB Bistro which has a lot more variety (Mozza doesn't even have pasta). They also give you free bread
1
We booked 10 people, got to the restaurant and they placed us on 2 tables. they said the policy was maximum 6 people to a table. but we could put up with this. the food is overpriced, the wine list is like an encyclopaedia with probably 500 wines or more. Problem is they are unheard of Italian wines and way over priced. The cheapest bottle was $120 and most we around $400. But we could put up with this. The food is the thing that is terrible. Small portions, over priced and inedible. Im talking about chewy over cooked meat, stale breads and strange tastes. The waiters almost con you into ordering expensive things, its like they get commission on how much they sell. The Manager / Owner must be ex use car salesmen! Also the meals are bland and boring - I ordered the Duck. It came out looking like a small piece of KFC. No vegetables, no garnish. Unbelievable. I was entertaining guests that are well travelled including myself. They all agreed this was THE worst dining experience they had ever had. Small, overpriced, bland meals
4
Had a lovely dinner with friends at Osteria Mozza. We made reservations for a group of eight a day before and were easily accommodated. For starters, my husband had the Buffala Mozzarela with Prosciutto and I had the Butter Lettuce Salad which were very good. They had large servings which we shared. We had the Linguini with Clams and the Goat cheese Ravioli and it was good we decided on the small portions otherwise we wouldn't have been able to finish it. We shared desserts with the group but I was too full to try any. Service was good, waiters were pleasant and I appreciated that all four of us ladies were given bag holders to hang our bags from at the side of the table. We only wished we could take them home, but had to leave them behind. The location was good because after dinner, we we able to watch the Light and Water show outside, and was a short walk back to the hotel
1
What a let down Osteria Mozza is. As a restaurant in a shopping mall, attempting to recreate an Italian bistro, the food was grossly overpriced, the pasta sauces too rich and cloying, the wine selection overwhelming and expensive. Only go if you are a Lenny Kravitz fan - he might be okay to cook to in the kitchen, but if your diners are looking forward to a nice evening, enjoying the company of their dinner companions, then this is not the place. The music was far too loud and intrusive. The service was poor and who has ever heard of having your wine glass seasoned? I was ready to send the glasses back as they looked dirty. If money is no object, and you enjoy objectional service and loud music then this is the place for you
5
After many failed attempts, we finally got to try this place. We ordered a range of items but were very impressed with the pizza. The base of the pizza is very thin but crispy as they cook it in a wood fire oven. Definitely will be back!
5
Ate at both Pizzeria and Osteria on 2 successive nights.Pizzeria is known for its pizzas, and you can pick any of the pizzas and pasta dishes and it is good.At Osteria, had the Caprese from their Mozzarella Bar and the Grilled Wagyu Beef Tagliata with rucola & Parmigiano Reggiano. The Caprese was different, as it came with 8 (I think) different varieties of cherry tomatoes and a chunk of Buffala Mozzarella in the middle. Was quite tasty. But what blew me away was the Wagyu Beef Tagliata. The flavor and taste was deeply in the beef, and paired with one of the Bastianich wines, was one of the best meals I've had in a while.B&B (Batali & Bastianich) in Vegas was a bit of a letdown for me, but I'm glad I gave this Batali eatery a try

There are so many fine italian restaurants in Singapore ! If you want to eat italian , go to Oso or Otto or Osvaldo or Gaia but not here ( except maybe for the pizzas ). The place is nice and vibrant , the service is fine . But the food is not truly italian . What you receive is not what you expect . The only advantage of this place is that it is conveniently located on Marina Bay shopping mall
5
Having been a fan of the food of Nancy Silverton for many years I was looking forward to visiting Mozza. It seems to be booked out most of the time but after a twenty minute wait we got a place at the bar which was fine. We had the Bruschetta with white bean purÃ©e and Saba,followed by a salad of Bib Lettuce,Blue Cheese and Dates,a Pizza with Salami,Chilli and Mozzarella and to finish a Caramel Coppetta.As with most things in Singapore it is not cheap.All the above was to share between two and with 3 glasses of wine the bill came to $SG 160 or about $US 128. But I felt it was worth every cent. The service was excellent and speedy and the food on a whole different level to even the better Pizza Chains. The Pizza dough was maybe the best I have ever tasted and I know from personal experience and living in Italy that this is something that takes years to perfect.Tha Marina Bay Shopping Complex is world class and a perfect location for this excellent restaurant
4
Gotta have the porcini rubbed rub eye. Just try it. Low end wine is good for washing feet but not much else. Choose something above $300 and you'll be happy.Service? Well, this is Singapore but there usually is a foreign manager around to keep the staff on their toes.Worth the expense
5
I've been 2 times to Mozza, and I'm looking forward to my next visit to Singapore just to try this restaurant again. Expensive? Yes, very expensive, but worth it all the way. Starters, mains, are great, and the chocolate dessert was amazing!!!Service is great.The only downfall is that if you don't make reservations in advance its always so busy that you need to wait hours in the queue. They will have your mobile number so you can walk around and be called when your table is ready.A bit loud (because there's always so many people
1
The atmosphere is American - Italian, very cosy and friendly. But the food is extremely overpriced and the worst I've ever had. To top it all we were charged for a plate I could not eat because of a food intolerance (and yes, I did ask beforehand about the specific ingredient which, by the way, was not shown in the menu). All in all a very bad experience.
2
Had my second visit to Mozza Pizzeria recently with a larger group of friends on our way to the theater - the menu choice is very limited if you are not a pizza fan (which one or two of the group were) and to be honest the food when delivered is pretty ordinary. Service is Ok but tendered on the slow side as the place was very busy at the time. The price per head is extremly high given that its simply an up market pizza shop .. which just shows what a little marketing and location can do for you
1
Osteria Mozza was promising during my first visit. The second visit proved to be disappointing as the standard of the food and services had dropped tremendously. The quality of the food was uneven at best. The calamari was badly charred to the extent that it tasted bitter. Similarly, the bread that accompanied the octopus was charred too. When we brought the matter up to the manager, she proudly told us the dish is supposed to be this way and we should have eaten the calamari with the condiment and vegetables. She offered no other option and simply walked away after explaining. We were left baffled by her indifference and arrogance, treating us as if we were a bunch of illiterate. When the matter was brought to the attention of the GM, he even mentioned that grilled items are supposed to be burned and did not bother to offer any alternative, nor look at the condition of the dish before commenting. We are not aware of any culture that loves bitter tasting food, not to mention charred food that could be cancer causing. The nonchalant attitude of the stuff is simply unacceptable and intolerable. When the pasta arrived, it tasted as if it had been soaked in salt water overnight. It was so salty that we had trouble swallowing. Again, the staff offered no apology when we asked for the item to be cancelled. The snapper and the quail fared slightly better, but by that time we had totally lost our appetite and zest. Dining in Osteria proved to be torturing. We can't wait to get out of this noisy and boisterous restaurant that sounded more like a fish market, where everybody has to compete to raise his or her voice to be heard. Avoid at all costs unless you have tons of money to throw away

Great food lots of variety. Okay wine list. I would go again! Downfall??? Expensive. I still would go again!
4
service was great altho place was packed one evening. food was just good (expected it to be exquisite).
5
I'm not a big pizza eater but although it was $35 a pizza it was the best thing I have eaten in a long time.
5
we went to this place after seeing the show in the theater. the food are so unbelievably good i cried. honest to God, while i was eating the pizza my eyes start to water. the service was exceptionally good, very attentive and friendly. i remember this dinner forever!
2
My husband and I went to Mozza for our wedding anniversary. We ordered burrata (we liked it despite the minimalist portion) and pasta with ragu lamb (inedible). The wagyu beef main dish was a sad experience. Such a great meat had been marinated with balsamic vinegar and other spices that left an unrecognisable wagyu beef taste. We were willing to have a great and expensive dinner and we ended having an expensive dinner not worthing it. The service was impeccable
5
This restaurant is best for serious food fanatics who appreciate food and do not mind paying for it. The recent trip was on 26 th July 2012. I understood from the waitress the menu changes everyday. We went straight for the Chef Tasting Menu which will give us both the selections as the Chef Tasting Menu required the participation of the entire table. The Antipasta: 1) Red Endive, Fennel & Parmagianno with Anchovy dressing was by far the best starter to tingle your taste buds. The sourness complimented the Parmagianno so well with the endive, stirring any appetite if you had none to begin with. 2) Grilled Sardines with Peperonata was muted but outstanding in its simplicity and freshness from the sardines. Real sardines!  Read more in moleonmouth.blogspo

We visited the 'Garden by the Bay' a Dream Land creation of Casino Lords of Las Vegas and wandered through the Plaza next door that had every designer store you can name and more open till past 10:00 pm. Singapore economy is abuzz and booming.Fortunately, we had made reservations for the Pizzeria as the Osteria was booked for the evening till late. That was to be the first Pizza during our two week visit, so we just went to absorb the hub hub of the place. It is loud, busy and the food came quick but hot and tasty. Everything we ordered was to our expectations - the appetizers and then the pizzas that followed were great. It is an eatery in the true sense. Servers were friendly and when we enquired about some of the ingredients served, she was good to get the information from the kitchen
5
I have been to Mozza about 3 times now and the food is always amazing, i have tried a selection of the pizzas on the menu and they taste amazing. The tomato sauce they use has a unique taste and is lovely. The food is always fresh and although you have to wait while it cooks it is always worth the wait. I will definately be back
2
We had a great appetizer, but the pizza had a tomato sauce that tasted like plum jam. Like the sour umeboshi of Japanese cuisine. So, 1 great appetizer, 2 bad pizzas, water, average service for about 110 dollar at lunch. I think that it's not worth the price you pay. But I have to say that the ham they use for their dishes is excellent
5
I have reviewed this restaurant twice already and it is always a must on my list of places to eat when in Singapore. This time was even more amazing as we were in Singapore after an extensive trip through Europe with over 2 weeks spent travelling and dining around Italy...I have to say that my best "Italian" meal on our extended trip was in fact at Mozza in Singapore! My husband is Italian and was expecting something amazing during our travels through Italy, however we had to wait to return to our own back yard to experience it. Mozza is consistently one of the best restaurants around. Although pricey to some, for me, you pay what you get for and when you get 5 star service and THE most amazing food, why wouldnt you expect to pay. Thanks to Will and Amy for treating us so well and i cant wait for my next visit to Singapore so i can savour the Batali delicacies all over again. Well done on being consistently soooo good!!

Found this restaurant by accident and would Highly recommend this restaurant
4
had 2 kinds of pizza.
which were both good, one with veggies and one with meatballs and had a yummy desert-brown butter tart with plum and mascarpone sauce. they where generous with complementary appetizer and they keep on refiling our glasses with water. good service.
3
I can only talk about what I ate there.A friend of mine and I ordered Prosciutto di Parma, rucola, tomato & mozzarella. We both thought that it was too salty. My husband and other friend ordered Fennel sausage, panna, red onion & scallions. I tasted it and that was excellent! So for me, it was hit or miss experience.For the location, price is decent. Causal but nice atmosphere (We were there for lunch and 90% of customers seem to be business people). If you order pizza, expect to wait long time. Service is fine otherwise
4
The food was lovely and very tasty but the prices are.....ouch!We had a mix of pasta dishes which included a very nice sweet potato ravioli , very tasty. The pork chop was excellent but both dishes just needed a little side to support them for the prices charged. Bread was plentiful and very tasty. Staff attentive and polite.This is a very nice restaurant ideal for special meals

Great place to go to for a lovely romantic dinner even if you're a vegetarian and a teetotaler. We always go for seats by the bar counter. Anand is a great bartender whose recommendations we always follow with no regrets whatsoever.The portions are small, but quite filling especially with frequent helpings of sourdough bread every time it's brought out in all its warm delight. If you sit by the bartender, you usually get first dibs (Which is why that's a favorite place for us :P) An appetizer, 2 or 3 plates of pasta (the one in the white sauce is comparable to little morsels from heaven), a few drinks and desert come to about SGD200 which we feel is justified. Plus, the chef usually sends out complimentary concoctions. The first time we went there, they even put the drinks on the house.I love the Osteria experience. It remains one of my favourite places for dinner in Singapore. If you're looking for a great night out, go for a show at the MBS theatre, dinner at Osteria and wind up with a nice walk around the place

I went to Mozza with my family during my visit to Singapore lately. Stayed at MBS so it was convenient. The restaurant is nicely decorated, very modern looking and you can see the fire place for them to cook pizza there. I ordered appetizer mussels with white wine sauce for myself, the bread with spicy cheese spread is amazing! Then of course, the pizza! I ordered mushroom pizza which was tasty and loaded with topping. Service was okay overall, wish the staff can smile more often

My boyfriend ate here on our vacation and we ordered their pasta. The waiter warned us that their portion is quite small but we said it would be fine. Our dishes arrived at our table in quite a reasonable portion and we happily enjoyed our dinner. When the bill came, we were charged for 2 "family sized" portion at $60 a plate!!!! Our bill came to $200, with no wine or liquor. We were aghasted but couldn't do anything since we ate the meal already. We looked around at other guests portion and it was literally a "coin" of pasta on a massive plate for individual portion! What a joke!!! Please be aware of their dirty tactic at this restaurant
2
Although some of the reviews were very good, we did not have that experience. The portions were very small, and the pizza was very overpriced. Hardly any chesse, mostly crust and sauce on our pizza. The appetizers were gone in two bites. It was a bit crowded dues to its central location in the mall, but I will not be coming back on my next trip to Singapore

As a non-dairy eater, dining at Italian restaurants has always been rather difficult for me as there is a lot of cheese in Italian dishes. Once seated at Osteria Mozza, the service staff immediately asked for any dietary restrictions before making menu recommendations and when I told her that I don't eat cheese and dairy, she was very diligent in only recommending non-dairy options. Moreover, what really impressed me was that even when they served the complimentary starter (which was ricotta on toast), they made a non-dairy option for me which was also delicious. My husband had ordered mozzarella and leek and without us asking, they served the mozzarella on the side so that I could have a taste of the leek. This was really an extra touch that made dining there all the more pleasant. Of course, the food was lovely and service excellent. Didn't skip a beat
5
This is the 2nd time i have eaten here, and the pizza is easily the best in singapore. Great starters and breads, and a very well priced wine list. Get along there if you can get a booking!! The service can be a little slow, just given how busy the place is, but the food more than makes up for it. And the ambience of the room is verry good, given MBS can sometimes feel a bit sterile, but the room works really well
4
The pizza was really nice with a thin crust and not too cheesy. But the calamari was the standout. Perfectly cooked and the sauce/dressing and beans were brilliant.
5
A casual pizza lunch with outstanding pizzas on a Sunday afternoon. Really friendly and particularly good to our four year old son. We are heading back on Saturday night to try the Osteria side.
5
We dined in Pizzeria and their pizzas were really impeccable. Try booking your table as early as your can as tables can get quite full during weekends or on special occasions.
5
Have several delicious dishes out from the ordinary Italian restaurant artound SEA, enjoy so much.

One of the celebrity restaurant on our trip. Accommodated our three young kids made a bar bench available for our family. The food was good, the pizza was made from best ingradients and the cocktails were innovative

There are two adjoining restaurants in the Bay Sands with a common reception. On the left is Osteria and the right Pizzeria.......and the reviews here all seem to be about the Pizzeria for which the reviews sound very different to my experiences of Mozza Osteria.I was recently there having insisted that we went after a visit some 18 months before when I was the guest. It was above excellent then and it was above excellent this time. I found that we were at exactly the same table with the same bubbly waitress who could have any job in sales so good is she. There is a tasting menu that friends of mine who had it said it is to die for plus an A La Carte with starters, including about 12 dishes with different sorts of Mozzarella cheese, a pasta course with some 18 dishes that could be mains or intermediate course, and the actual mains course. I had pasta with rabbit ragu followed by pan fried sea trout and it was, as another critic would say, historic!!A great meal with great wine, in great surroundings with great staff............get there (and there is the bonus that Singapore ain't bad either)
4
I had lunch at Pizzeria Mozza at the end of a recent conference in the attached Marina Bay conference facility. Nice table in the open window fronting onto the shopping mall. The pizza I ordered was small (maybe 6 inches in diameter), but tasty. I would have had dessert, but the server was nowhere to be found, so I simply paid and left. Bottom line was that a little personal pizza and two beers cost $64 (Singapore dollars - about $48 in US $). Must have some mighty high rent to pay
5
We decided to check this restaurant out one Sunday afternoon but was not sure if we had to wait long for a table. Thank goodness, we were ushered to our table relatively quickly. I liked the way the menu is set out, food menu on the one side and wine menu on the other side but the whole menu is folded to a card size which did not take up too much room on the table.We were famished and looking at the menu we knew it was going to take us a bit longer to order. The pizza menu had a great selection but... what is a Burrata? What is a Robiola? or even a Stracciatella?? Huh? Anyway, we decided to take a stab and settled for something safe such as Funghi misti, fontina, talleggio & thyme pizza together with a Fennel sausage, panna, red onion & scallions pizza. Since the pizzas were going to take a while to cook, we decided to have a couple of antipasti - chicken wings and calamari al forno. We also ordered a lasage al forno for the 5 year old foodie.We were served some crispy pizza bread while waiting - it was tasty and crispy. Our antipasti came next - the chicken wings were nicely marinated and the meat dropped off the bone. The calamari was tasty as well although a tad on the salty side.The pizzas arrived next and yes! -they were worth the wait... The crust around the edges were light, fluffy and crispy and most of us saved the crust to the last! Both the fillings were really tasty too and blended well.The lasagne was the last to arrive - we were not sure why it took so long but guess what... the 5 year old on the table really loved it and had the whole lasagne all to herself... she kept asking for MORE... !!We did not have any more room for dessert which was a shame.As a new visitor to this restaurant, I was a bit sad that I could not get this type of pizza in Sydney! Bummer

I should know better to steer away from celebrity restaurants -- all hype! This one is no exception. The pizza menu was extensive and did have a nice variety of gourmet pizzas. We settled for the pizza with fennel...which came with plenty on it -- too much in fact. Nothing spectacular for the hefty price they charged. The biggest plus was their service -- great wait staff. Again, it was "ok" but nothing that made it stand out from any crowd

This is a Mario Batalli restaurant so I was hoping and expecting that the food would be good. I wasn't disappointed.Prices range from $18 - $38 Singapore for a pizza; Anitpasti from $15 - 18 SD; Salads $10 - $20 SD; Main Meals $25 - $36 SD; Bruschette $15 - 18 SD. Excellent range of Italian wines by the glass or bottle.Great value.Menu states 45 mins wait for pizza as they are handcrafted. Even though the restaurant was packed, the wait was approx 15 minutes.Noisy as it was full but still had a great atmosphere.Service was impeccable with friendly staff.Tip: try for a 'window' seat so that you can people watch as they shop in the Centre.Loved it. Will def go again when next in Singapore
3
Nothing special about the pizzas and too expensive for what you get. Can`t compete with the usual Wolfgang Puck places for example... Skip it when you`re in Singapore
3
Pizza itself is average, atmosphere is bustling, perhaps espeically because it was before a show at the theater just across. Service is nothing to remember, would not go again unless we happen to be in MBS area and feel like pizza.
5
Just fantastic... The price is a bit high for the budget traveler but definetly one of the best restaurants I've hang around in my life... 100% recommended.
Cheers
Diego

The food is generally good!
I ordered the waygu and wanted to have french mustard. But the waiter told me that the sauce is how good and so good! So they refused to give me the french mustard!
4
The insalata mista was bitter. The garlic bread was nice, but quite oily. Thr pizzas were v nice - handcrafted n fresh! Keep In mind they take 45 mins to make Not many options fr veg people - no starters (e.g bruschettas) were vegGreat atmosphereReally cool placemats - diff for each personWorth visiting for pizzas
5
I have already review this restaurant in the past, but seriously cant help but write it up again upon a recent return visit. Osteria Mozza (fine dining restaurant) is simply some of the best Italian food i have eaten, and my Italian husband agrees!The service is impeccable, the dining area itself, although bustling (playing a strange music set list) is intimate and enticing. The menu has a number of traditional italian dishes with a modern twist. The wine list is comprehensive, however could do with more world wide varieties and not all Italian, but seriously a minor point.Compared to some of the other top restaurants around the world i think the prices are extremely good value when you are dining on such fresh and high quality ingredients.If you like good italian food i highly recommend a visit. I will definitely continue to dine there whenever in Singapor
4
Went to this place randomly without any expectations, and was blown away by the panini, the cheese and the pizza. The charcuterie used was of excellent quality. But the greatest part was of course the pizza: the crust was fantastic, hand-made and wood-fire grilled.And one last thing: they have two zones a "pizzeria" and "osteria" which is for more formal dining. I would recommend going to the pizzeria
5
A cllient hosted a dinner for us at Osteria Mozza to celebrate a milestone. The food, wine, service and superb company all contributed to a wonderful evening. I had been there a year before for a quick pizza lunch, but that dinner in the private room was something else. Out host had thoughtfully selected several starters, entrees and desserts to share family-style. I loved the Red Endive, Fennel & Parmigiano Reggiano with anchovy date dressing; the mozzarellas - burata and bufala; Orecchiette with sausage & Swiss chard and the Brasato al Barolo [braised short rib with horseradish gremolata]. The staff were friendly but not over-familiar. We could not stop thanking our host after
4
The food here was excellent....quite pricey but I guess you don't mind that with the quality you get. In the main the service was excellent with very attentive staff. However with the desert we ordered that had a ten minute prep time (this was important as we'd booked as a pre-theatre meal) we were told after about 15 minutes that the chef was starting it again as she wasn't happy with how it had set. Fantastic attention to quality.... However, the desert finally arrived almost 30 minutes after originally ordering it allowing us only 5 minutes to eat it to make the show, and the desert wines we had ordered had obviously been finished long before with no offer of a complimentary second. The issue I guess is that the restaurant seems perfect until something deviates from expectations and the staff seem unable to deal with it appropriately. I'd still recommend people to try this place, but if something goes wrong, be very clear with them what you want so your overall experience is not tainted when you're paying almost $600 for a meal for two

I ate at the Pizzeria. It was a spur-of-the-moment decision, but we secured a reservation for places at the counter before the restaurant opened for dinner. The wait staff were cheery and enthusiastic, and the pizzas piping hot - I may be philistine, but though I find it easy to tell when pizza's bad (cold, soggy, ungenerous), I can't really distinguish one competently-made pizza from another - the few crispy-crusted, topping-laden ones we wolfed down at Mozza were as good as any of their Italian/ (insert city with major Italian immigrant influence) brethren. The sodas were also good.There are definitely cheaper options out there, but Pizzeria Mozza is not a bad choice for an unpretentious meal at the Sands
5
The restaurant has 2 sections. The pizzeria is more laid back, bustling and serves the most amazing pizzas i have had anywhere outside of italy. The other section called the osteria, is quite, trendy and looked very expensive. Not really what i was looking for, so i chose the pizzeria. You will not be disappointe
5
Party of 2, we did the tasting menu at Osteria Mozza. The food was absolutely divine. Each course was beautifully presented and the pasta especially was the highlight. The service was excellent and the waiter took care to ask if we had any food allergies which was a nice touch since typically there are no substitutions allowed. Drinks were on the pricey side but overall the ambiance and meal were well worth it
4
I visited Osteria Mozza while on a business trip. The atmosphere is by far the best I have seen - the staff is very attentive and explain the menu very well. You need that explanation as the way the menu is written is a bit complex for my understanding (I had an Italian colleague with me and he concurs also). The Mozza is located in the Shoppes and Mall of the Marina Bay Sands, hence if you are staying there, its a worthwhile place to visit. The restaurant has two parts - the Pizzeria (more informal) and the Osteria (more formal fine dining). The food itself is very good, lot of good options. The food is very rich, so you may have to hit the gym before and after. The portion sizes are decent, very good presentation, but the food pricing is fairly high. However, that shouldn't be a deterrent to visit it atleast once. Pluses: Location, Atmosphere, Food varietyDeltas: Food is just too rich, small portions and high pricesIn summary, I would recommend this place to others on a special occasion only

Have eaten @ Pizzeria Mozza a few times, both at lunch and dinner and always enjoyed the experience. Always busy and bookings are essential. Loud, and noisy and lots of fun, especially with a group.Be aware that while Pizzeria Mozza and Osteria Mozza are owned by the same people, next to each other and share toilets, the prices are very different. Pizzeria Mozza is the more relaxed and cheaper option. Osteria is more fine dining.Pizzeria Mozza menu focuses on pizzas, antipasti, and salads. Food is good and very tasty.Have loved the:Arancine alla bolognese in antipastiCalamari al forno with fagioli & oregano in antipasti Any of the CarneTricolore with Parmigiano Reggiano & anchovy dressing in saladsMargherita with mozzarella, tomato & basil pizzaFunghi misti, fontina, taleggio & thyme pizzaProsciutto di Parma, rucola, tomato & mozzarella pizzaGood wine list with lots of Italian wines.Recommended

The key to a great dining experience at any restaurant is knowing what to order. So here's what we ordered and you can judge for yourselves if you wanna do the same:Burrata with Parma Ham- Waste of money and time. There was literally a DROP of burrata in a sea of ham. The result was it tasted like the filing of a ham and cheese sandwich.Broccolini- Overly sour - tasted kinda like chinese food. But the texture of the broccolini was excellentGarganelli Bolognese- This is one of the best bolognese I've ever had. The pasta was nicely al dente, and there was none of that doughy texture that we associate with mediocre pastas. The sauce was sufficient and didn't taste washed out.Beef Tagliata- I'm convinced that Osteria's strong suit is beef. This was excellent - juicy with nicely charred edges, and the cut was not too fatty.Duck al Mattone- I love duck, but this was not good at all. The skin was golden brown but not crispy. and the flesh was dry. Don't waste your time.Olive Oil Cakes (Dessert)- Great! highly recommended.We also had a bottle of Brandini Dolctto (house wine) for about S$85. The total bill came up to about S$340. The atmosphere is casual (unlike some of the restaurants in town with comparable prices, like Abstinte, which is of course terrible) and friendly. If you can, ask for a table near the windows so that you can have a nice little corner to yourself. The wait staff are very well-trained, helpful and extremely attentive - it's hard to find such good service in Singapore. It's a pity that the food doesn't justify the price

Located at Marina Bay Sands , the Osteria was cozy, with another table of four rather too close to ours.( Wish the windows overlooking the beautiful Marina Bay view instead of shoppers passing by ). Prosecco was $ 22 each, the antipasti and cheese dish selections are good especially my Bufala Proscuitto in a large plate would be enough for two ( $25 ), pane pomodoro ($ 28) was tasty. We each oredered pasta with ragu: Oxtail for me ( $ 60 ) and maltagliati in duck ragu ( $ 57 ) for my husband- both are tasty : however, both are definitely are too salty - and I like salty food ! Cauliflower side dish tastes good ( $14 ) would be nice if it were cut rather smaller. We each had a glass of red wine ( $18 each ). We did not have desert . The desert selections are a nuovo style Italian - American . With 10 % service charge and 7% GST our dinner for two was $ 311. KIndly note we did not have first plate and second plate courses nor a bottle of wine
5
GREAT FOOD!!! everything's fresh and even though is not the traditional confort food from italy is a very good choice!!! new takes on the traditional dishes!!! I tried the mozzarella and burrata and it was good (i'm italian so i can vouch for that). We had pasta for second course and it was good! Actually everything was great!I highly Recommend this ristorante!!
5
Nestled in the amazing Marina Bay Sands shopping mall Mozza Pizzeria and Osteria will dazzle your taste buds with unquestionably the best Italian food i have eaten outside Italy. The restaurant is divided into two halves. The Osteria focuses on fine dining and provides a more intimate setting whilst the pizzeria delivers something akin to a 'taverna' experience. Every dish that appeared was tantalizing and carefully prepared. From antipasto to dessert continued a veritable excursion through a landscape of flavours and specialities that lovingly defines the finest elements of Italian cuisine. Table service was attentive and intelligent, the ambience revisits the heart of Italy without being kitsch. I thoroughly recommend this as a must do dining experience when in Singapore. It was without question one of the most memorable gastronomic treats i have ever had. Advanced reservations highly recommended. Otherwise expect at least 30- 40 waiting time during busy periods
3
Mozza did not really live up to my expectations - there is a note on the menu that pizzas take 45 minutes to prepare and when my pizza did finally arrive the base was very crunchy, perhaps too much so. I did enjoy mozza overall though, the staff were good and the atmosphere was fun so I would probably return although not for a pizza this time
3
We went there in a party of six before going to watch WICKED across at the Theatre. Its a buzzing place with good service. As with all the MBS restaurants, I remain amazed that the windows look into the shopping centre and not onto the bay. Watching other people shop is not the most riveting thing... The appetizers were generally good - we had bbq calamari, bean and hazlenut salad (excellent); caesar salad, wings (not recommended compared to the more interesting things on the menu but we were catering for two kids).The panini was undercooked and doughy and too full of slabs of meat. The 5 pizza's varied from perfect (the mushroom pizza was sensational), a good Margherita, to average (Goats Cheese and Rucola), to a very soggy Hawaiian which was so bad even my son left it. It was explained at the end that hawaiian Pzza's were always soggy - wish I knew before I spent $40 on it. Would I go again? Not sure but I would give the Ossteria next door a try without the kids. Next time we go to the Theatre in MBS we'll head to DB Modern as that was great on the last vist
3
I know I should have expected the prices to be high given that it is on MBS.... but a bit too insane given that it is just pizza. $110 for 2 beers, wings and a pizza
It was a good pizza though admittedly
3
Limited menu but clearly focused what they do well which is Pizza. Their pizzas are thin crust, lovely topping, nice size for 2 persons. My kind of place for a quick meal.
4
You can tell a good Italian by its margherita, and this one is excellent!! Can't wait to try more!
5
My husband and I ate at Mozza on our last night in Singapore. This was our first time at a Mario Battali restaurant. The pizza was delicious, perhaps one of the best we've had. We also ordered the meatballs, which were quite yummy, and dessert was amazing
4
Mozza is opposite the entrance to the theatre in the Marina Bay Sands complex, which made it a convenient choice for our dinner before the show. Service was very prompt and although the menu warns that the pizzas may take 45 minutes to deliver, we had ours in fifteen minutes.The ambience is good-like almost every other pizzeria in the universe you can see the chefs at work in front of the oven, but there are also cute little touches like the envelope holding your cutlery or the placemats decorated with random excerpts from Italian phrase books, comics and so on.The pizza toppings are very good; we had a margherita and a mushroom pizza, which were both good, although I found the bases a bit over the top; I'm used to a thinner Roman crust. Still, a good, lively venue for dinner
4
I dined here with my brother and we ordered the tasting menu. This was a great way to sample what the restaurant had to offer! There were about 5 courses and the portions and timing made sure that there was still room for the next course and that we would appreciate the taste of what was to come. Save for the wee bit salty steak in the main course, all the dishes tasted great. Our server was very accommodating and thats always a big plus. I would definitely go back on my next visit
5
While the intention was to gorge on Asian food in Singapore, Mozza was a wonderful surprise to my family's tastebuds. One can tell that this resto does not compromise on quality. I asked for draft beer and was told that since the mall had an exclusivity deal with a local brand which the resto found to be below their standard, Mozza opted to NOT stock draft beer and go with bottled libation instead. It has principles (so rare these days)!. As the name of the restaurant suggests, we felt compelled t try their insalata caprese. Wow, the mozzarella was creamy and delightful, and the cherry tomatoes the perfect partner. We had a grilled squid appetizer with garbanzos that we all loved. Our main dish was a goat cheese pizza which was thin and heavenly...just like in Italy. Try their garlic bread....it is so much like pan amb tomaquet of catalunya, spain. We loved the ambience, noisy and lively as any decent restaurant should be
5
This is a fine restaurant immediately across the Grand Theater of Marina Bay Sands, making it a good dinner option if you're catching a show. The ambiance is nice if a bit crowded - if you're going to eat there on a weekend before a show, a reservation is a must.Service is efficient. Most of the staff is pleasant and friendly. The appetizers we had - Fried potatoes, ceci & herbs and the Arancine alla bolognese were flavorful and enjoyable, as was our Mozza caprese salad. We've tried several of their pizzas, all of which are served with a light thin crust, and all are quite delicious. Their Chicken Cacciatore is also good, served in its sauce, not over any pasta.It's a bit on the pricey side, but for me, it was money well spent. I would definitely eat here again
3
We ate at the Osteria expecting a fabulous meal but all we got was bloated stomachs. There was too much bread with everything and the mozzarella we had for appetizers was drowned in olive oil. We ordered a pasta meal each and was advised by the wait staff to get the main size as the entree size was small. This was not the case. The main size is huge and neither of us was able to finish the bowl. If you are getting an appetizer with your meal then do not waste your money on the main size. The service was quite good but the gnocchi that my partner ordered was sold out which was disappointing.The wine is so unbelievably expensive with only two or three wines available by the glass.Overall the food tasted ok, not great, just ok and definitely not worth the amount of money we paid
5
Unbelievable, these are without doubt the best pizza's I've ever eaten outside of Italy, luckily the wait is worth it. Yes, you do have to wait at least 30 minutes, especially during their busy perio for your pizza to arrive, but as soon as you take your first mouthful you will have forgotten about the wait. This was our second visit ( we had to come back after our first visit last year) and we hadn't made a reservation, but it was quite late in the evening and they managed to find us a table. What I was a little surprised about was the service was a little hit and miss, the staff just seemed to be waiting for everyone to leave and most of the time were just chatting amongst themselves, a couple of the chefs were sitting at the bar having a drink, which is not a problem after service, but not so great when you still have customers in the restaurant eating
5
one of the best meals in a long time so we went back 3 times. Chef David is amazing and i cannot rate him highly enough. excellent food and service and worth every cent. Possibly the best restaurant in SIN. Must GO
4
It is sort of a good family and get together resturant. The food is good, with much variety of pizza choices. Great tasty Italian gelato, I have tried the olive oil flavour.... I really like it. The atmosphere is nice, staff is friendly, ready to give recommendations. Price is reasonable, considering the location, about $100 for lunch for 2, including drinks, appetizer, meal and dessert. Worth trying, although could be a bit crowded, but there is plenty of seats and rather spacious
3
I finally visited Pizzeria Mozza together with a friend after having read so many raving reviews. The pizza was ok but nothing I’d write back home about. In fact, I think Spizza would compete quite favourably against Pizzeria Mozza in a blind tasting. In addition, I didn’t like the mall setting as it feels a bit like having dinner in an airport terminal. Probably works well for American and Asian “mall rats” but a bit off-putting for someone from Europe
5
Of all the restaurants in Singapore, I chose to go to Pizzeria Mozza for my birthday. It's that good!We like to sit at the bar area where the pizza is made. They pay enormous attention to detail and it's fun to watch. When you first sit down, they bring you these parm/rosemary homemade crackers that are unbelievable. They also carry USA IPA beer. So good!We always order a Nancy's Salad--salami meats, cheeses, chopped lettuce and red cabbage--it's beautiful. The pizzas are perfect. They're basically personal pizzas, so we order 2. We love to order a white one and a red one. The white one with the fennel sausage is my favorite. Dessert is good, but not my favorite, probably because I just want Italian Cream Cake for some reason. The restaurant is expensive, but really not too bad if you're not having alcohol. We love it and highly recommend it--great job Mario. Just be sure to make reservations, especially if you're dining before a show

The wife and I went to Mozza's after watching a show at the MBS Theatre, just across the hall in this huge mall. Not having had time for dinner, we were pleasantly surprised to see Mozza still open (they close at midnight), so we went for a late night pizza.Reception was very friendly, and as this was 22.30 h, we did get a seat. The restaurant, both pizzeria and osteria (divided by the reception), were well visited even at that time, I'd guess about 2/3 tables still occupied with many diners still having their mains.So this did bode well.While I was very hungry, my wife had had the chance to wolf down a sandwich prior to the show, so she only was interested in a hot chocolate, or maybe a warm desert. The waiter who came first- possibly an assistant- claimed there was no hot chocolate to be had, only tea or coffee. Later, she discovered hot chocolate on the desert menu, but wisely refrained likely due to the pricey price.I chose a pizza, described as "Salumi piccante, mozzarella, tomato & Fresno chiles" as per their online menu, which I reference while writing this review. Tastewise, as well as optically, this was a salami pizza. You may want to look up the the difference in wikipedia, keyword "salumi". To be honest, I had read "salami" on the menu and ordered that; the online menu from the pizzeria's website spells it salume, so now I am somewhat more disappointed...The pizza was one of the slightly smaller variates, good enough for one person. The dough was Italian in taste and thinness, but the crust was rather large with big bubbles, just like the American varieties. The salami cover was relatively sparse, but managed to provide a rich taste sensation. Which was not quite that of a traditional salami pizza, but also not so different as to provide a "wow" moment.The pizzeria's online menu states a price of S$26, I remember the print menu to have said S$29; the deserts on the online menu are 8- 9S$, but were all well above S$ 10 on the print menu. Specifically, the online price of gelato, S$8 for choice of three flavors, was a shocking S$ 17 on site. We missed out on the deserts because I have to earn my money, these prices seem targeted at casino winners.There is a big photo outside near the MBS theatre advertising Mozza, which shows a fat, bearded chef wearing sausages like a necklace. Given my experience last night, I kinda shudder at the thought that some paying customer may have been made to eat those sausages after the photo shoot...So in sum, I ate a smallish, very average pizza that tried to provide a new taste, but failed. For what I got, this was way overpriced. While I do not exclude ending up eating there again after a show at the theatre, I would not go there specifically
5
We went to Mozza's because we love Mario's show and we were going to the theatre across the mall. We ate in the more relaxed half where the wood-fired pizza ovens are and found it quite comfortable and the food was great. Staff were accommodating and courteous with no condescension. They even do "doggie bags" for anything you can't finish and held ours for us when we went to the theatre across the concourse.The bruschette with chicken liver, capers and pancetta were a nice size (not so thick that you couldn't bite into them without making a mess) but we found they had a slightly bitter taste.The pizza had one of the best crusts we've ever had (I don't usually eat all the crust, but did this time) and the sauce of olive oil, parsley and tomato was excellent.The wine list was extensive and they also sold by the glass.We also had the roasted olives which were a real treat.Yes it was a bit pricey, but the quality was there.The only criticism I would make is the use of paper napkins and placemats. I have to wonder if using linen wouldn't be more environmentally sound than throwing out all that paper
5
Mozza is an upscale Pizzeria located inside the Marina Bay Sands shopping center. It is extremely popular and usually requires a reservation. The pizzas are quite pricy compared to the more common chains. The pizza is delicious though. I visited with some Singaporean friends and we split three different pizzas, all of which were unique and scrumptious. I also enjoyed the atmosphere with friendly staff and 70's classic rock playing quietly in the background
4
I went to Pizzeria Mozza after watching the play, Wicked, at the theaters which is opposite this restaurant. My mother had reservations about going here as it was a bit pricy and she wondered if the taste would match the price as well as the portion size. However the place changed our initial perceptions. The hostess advised us accurately on when we should place our reservations. The service staff were friendly and helpful as well. We ordered a Margherita pizza and the Bianca with mozzarella. They were surprisingly good and I have never tasted pizza that was that full of flavour. Though I felt that the Margherita had a bit of an acidic taste because of canned tomatoes, i think, but you could look past it. Overall a great place to have dinner and I will definitely go back when I go for another play

The food, it's all about the food here. On one side, pizza to die for. I mean really. It's the pizza bases and the oven they're cooked in. The toppings are an add on. Beautiful pizza.Osteria is all about Buffalo Mozzarella - so try a selection from the Mozzarella Bar, amazing...! We chose to dine "family style" which is an option on the menu.. Iberico pork chops with fennel and sambucca, and we chose a selection of side orders to add to our gluttony. We were rewarded with a superb supper which we complimented with some wonderful Italian wines... Go, visit this place. The only downside was the reservations team who were remiss in their efficiency. But it didn't matter as we booked through the concierge at the Mandarin Oriental in the end who managed to find us a table on the day we wanted it, and at the time we wanted it. Attempts to book ourselves resulted in that silly "6:00pm or 9:45pm nonsense" and then unanswered emails by the reservation team meant we lost even these silly options. Use the clout of your concierge, restaurants always keep tables for these guys (if you're staying in a 5* hotel). Otherwise - good luck..

Lunch at the Singapore outlet of the Mario Batali & Nancy Silverton casual pizzeria in the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre in Singapore. It is located adjacent to Osteria Mozza which is slightly more upscale. Was extremely busy on the day we went and we could only get a couple of seats at the bar.We started with a dish of fried potatoes, chickpeas & herbs - simple but tasty. We also shared a mozzarella, tomato & basil (Margherita) pizza which was great, it was only small but the flavours were appealing and the crust was nicely crisp and bubbly.I would return if I'm in the area again and want something different to the excellent local food. It is good enough that even though it is expensive it is worth it
5
Perfectly cooked, fantastic ingredients is what you will encounter at pizzeria mozza. Get the waitstaff to match a bottle of red and you won't regret it.
Food 9.5/10 service 8.5/10 decor 8.5/10
P.S try the sausage and fennel

Excellent food and wine, great service. The Osteria has great starters, in fact two appetisers will make for a great meal. the Pizzeria is also wonderful, perfect for lunch, the fennel sausage pizza is the bomb.
4
Freshly made pizza, great starters. A bit noisy, not a good place for conversations.
3
We often go there , but this may be the last time, the pizzas are still very good but the services is poor , they are not trained , not nothing .....what a difference with the bIstro next door.
3
Place ok, service ok. I didn't like the american pizza style. not italian at all. no sparkling water (just the fake one from coca cola)...
3
My husband and I ate in Pizzeria Mozza for lunch. The place is nice and cozy. It was full during that time - several families were eating with their young kids with them. Service was fast, food serving size was average, taste of food is nothing spectacular. Should you want to try this place, especially if you are staying in Marina Bay Sands, make sure that you make a reservation, especially during dinner time
5
The food was sensational. Always wanted to eat at a Mario Batali restaurant. This certainly did not disappoint. My wife and I shared 2 starters and 2 small mains and 1 dessert... everyhting we tried was amazing. The burrata from the mozzarella bar was a real delight and the wagu steak for the main was probably the most flavorful steak we have ever eaten, cooked to perfection. Service was great, the head waiter was delightful and came over for a chat...gave some grappa to finish the meal off...Was not a cheap meal, but not unreasonable for that quality food and that location. Sometimes you go to "big name" restaurant and really regret the decision.....this certainly not one of those times....would love to go back and do it all again

We chanced on this restaurant by accident while at Marina Bay Sands to watch a show at the theatre. It turned out to be the discovery of our Singapore trip!! The pizzeria and bar had a nice warm ambience. At 10.30pm, we were probably amongst the last diners, so the place was not too crowded. The service was prompt. Our veg fritter and meat ball starters made for a good start for dinner. The clay oven baked, handmade pizzas were excellent. Their mouthwatering desserts rounded off the meal perfectly. Don't skimp on the desserts here and do not watch your calorie count for once!! In all, a pleasant dining experience
4
Had a lovely meal here.... About SGD80 for my meal, which was burrata with radicchio and candied walnuts, raviolo with egg and ricotta (divine!), mixed salad and a coffee. Lovely warm bread, attentive service. If you love Italian food and fresh cheeses, you must try it
4
My gf and I arrived on a busy evening when the only seats available were at the bar, right in front of where the pizzas are made. We had a fantastic view of the restaurant, and it was a great vantage point from which to people watch.What excited me at first was the selection of different styles of pizza available. We eventually settled on the pizza highlighting goat's cheese, adding a Caesar salad and few glasses of wine. We were not disappointed. The sizes were ample, but we left enough room for the lime pie, which was a delightful end to a satisfying meal. Overall, we would likely return to try something other than pizza...it helps that we were sharing the dishes. That kept the bill to a reasonable minimum
4
Food excellent but the music is deafening and hardly food for the ears!
5
I've been lucky enough to have been raised by an Italian mother who is a fantastic cook. Our family works in hospitality, so it's common that we'll eat in many great restaurants all over the world, and be lucky enough to also have amazing food at home.I've eaten in hundreds of Italian restaurants, but Osteria Mozza is genuinely one of the best. It's truly magnificent. We had the degustation menu, and it went from good to great to incredible with every dish
3
It was buzzing with energy and full of patrons seemingly enjoy themselves. We got a table for 5 close the bar counter. Lots of wait staff but something was missing. I expect as with anything in Singapore, the hardware is good on the surface but peel away the veneer and the software leaves much to be desired. Perhaps not fair as they were trying but I expect alot from a restaurant! We received our fold out menus and a small packet containing our cutlery and a card containing some interesting information about Italian culture. Nice touch! Our FOC starter was the delectable taco like chip flavored with parmesan and rosemary. Delectable. My son simply could not get enough. We had a carpese salad which was a bed of very fresh mozzarella cheese, covered with pesto sauce and garnished with baked cherry tomatoes. Again, just divine.The garlic bread was way too salty for our liking but then again as a habit we do not consume any salt with our food. I suspect that was the reason why the children did not like it but it down very well with the pesto.The main consisted of two pizzas. One margarita and the other their house speciality which was parma ham and arugula salad. The sauce on the pizzas is very good but the size of the pizza disappointing.I ordered two glasses of Pinot Grigio and the kids some pop and at the end a scoop of icecream for the kids. Total bill, a whopping $200. That in my estimation for pizzas is on the high side.Give it go if money is no object. I suspect this is not the place many hard working middle class Singaporeans will be going to any time soon. Rather, multimillionaire gamblers! Precisely why it is in the casino and priced the way it is

My friends and I went to the Pizzeria and had to make a reservation for 9.15pm on the day itself (around 4-5pm) to get seating - so its fairly popular and well-packed! The atmosphere is really nice though, not too noisy and filled with hustle and bustle and decorated in warm tones and colours to make you feel comfortable.Its split into the Pizzeria and Osteria (which is apparently more formal). My friends and I were always Pizza people and we made the right choice - the food was fantastic and we could order such a variety of food and try so many different things! We had quite alot of food that we thought wouldnt be enough, but by the end we were surprisingly full! (well i was :P). Between the 4 of us, we had 2 pizzas (the funghi misti, fontina, taleggio & thyme Pizza is good!), loads of antipastis (try the Mozarella! I'm not sure if its under antipasti or insalata - but do check it out!), the Lasagna al forno (the special on Sunday- RECOMMENDED by ME!), a few other things and 3 desserts!! Without wine, the bill was more affordable than expected at $60 per person. check out my photos for a look at SOME of the stuff we ordered.A small problem is the service - but this is a problem not at all exclusive to this restaurant - the restaurants in singapore sure seem to have alot of staff who cant seem to see customers hands and look the other way when needed! So its not a problem with Mozza in particular. I would still DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant when you want to do soemthing nice with your friends or with your partner/spouse.I absolutely loved it! the food, the atmosphere was warm and welcoming and made me enjoy my trip to MBS even more. After that, for drinks, drop by Ku-de-ta for drinks from $16 (beers) onwards. :

Space is limited and felt a bot cramped.Waiter was excellent, knowlegable and very good humouredWas not allowed to try tasting menu on my own (bizarre)Food is expensive. Wagyu steal was excellent however fish I had was bland and full of bones (Told it was fillet)Pasta starter with rabbit was tasty but not outstanding.Would try again if only for committment of waiter and will choose food carefull
5
My daughters and I are big fans of Mario Batali from Iron Chef America, so we were excited to visit one of his restaurants and we were not disappointed.We dined at the Osteria side of the restaurant. The service was excellent, waitstaff were helpful and always happy to answer questions. Serving sizes was not very big, which is normal in this type of restaurant, but was top quality and well presented. If I were to find a bad point, it woud be that the music was a bit loud. We would return for another visit
5
Amazing pizza... cant forget the taste. me and my husband were here for 5 weeks and visited it more than 7 times. the freshly made thin crust n its crispiness really makes us go again n again. its always almost full... specially on weekends cant expect table easily... but its worth waiting. The environment n people there also adds flavour to your dinner. if u are Italian cuisine lover... MUST VISIT IT.

Overall this place reminded me of a middle/upper-tier American chain restaurant rather than anything approaching a real Italian place or a celebrity restaurant. I used to eat at the Spotted Pig in NYC a lot and loved every visit I had there, so I was really, really looking forward to this.Good:- Pretty good service - front-of-house worked smoothly- Great cheese selection- Good vegetables for SingaporeBad:- Terrible execution:1) Our $50 pasta was totally undercooked and chalky to the bite2) Our gorgeous fresh mozza was drowned in oversalted toppings and then piled onto oily bread -- why would you do that to such awesome cheese? You could barely taste it.3) The "pork trotter" was basically a pork mcnugget with mustard mayo sauce for $17 - Music was way too loud half the time (only some tracks.. I like loud music in a good busy resto)- Salt, everything was way oversalted -- and I love salt too- It is in a shopping mall guys. How good can you get when there is a Blue "Citi" and red "OCBC" sign glowing out the window, right next to the massage place where little fish eat the dead skin off people's feet. Nice. Overall: good shopping mall Italian with good service - but not at all worth the high-end price-tag -- there are much better Italian places in Sing
3
The atmosphere is a bit chaotic and noisy, since we ate at the pizzeria side (which is the casual area of Mozza). The service is good though. The appetizers were ok, we had the aranicini (rice balls) in bolognese sauce - good. The squash blossoms were ok too. The "hawaiian" pizza with speck, was sweet and salty (good) but was somewhat dry and a bit tough to slice and bite. But if you compare it to Mozza in Los Angeles, the ambiance and food are the same. Nothing special for me. But the saving grace was the dessert - gelato and sorbet of 3 choices. Very good. We had peanut butter, vanilla gelato, and the chocolate sorbet. Another thing great is that they were able to accommodate us even if we didn't have reservations, though we had just 1 hour to eat until we had to leave to make room for the guys with reservations. No worries though. Unless we got to try Mozza in SG

MozaNetAverage. For a nice night out go elsewhere. Pros- fresh ingredients- generous portions- variety of dishes was good - extensive menu - friendly wait staff- convenient location near marina bay sands hotelCons- service seemed rushed- food was average - main course had dry/bland meat in the pasta but pasta itself was fresh , dessert was plain and lacked flavor Price- seemed high relative to quality/flavor  of the foo

In keeping with the general level of taste at Singapore's Marina Bay Sands Casino complex, the sign posts point to the row of "Celebrity Restaurants." Mozza, however, is the real deal: excellent food, beautifully presented. Good wine list, too.
4
Very tasty food with a great selection of Italian wine. Ask for the sommelier's recommendation and you can't go wrong.
3
Sharing walls and a hostess stand with the fine-dining restaurant 'Osteria Mozza" doesn't mean this pizza place is a 5-star on its own! Ehhhh...I enjoyed the pizza, but it's not something I'd go back for. Singapore has too many other places to eat. Fair enough, they do have a hard-to-find "salami" picante-a pepperoni-like topping, a rare find here in Singapore, but I think I can find a real slice of "ZA" somewhere else
3
We ate at Pizzeria Mozza for lunch with my husband and toddler son. The place had cosy feel to it and service was quick and efficient. We ordered the calamari al forno, which was very well cooked drizzled in high quality extra virgin olive oil with chickpeas and oregano. Followed by the funghi misti, fontina, taleggio or mushroom pizza and special of the day, chicken cacciatore. We wanted to order pasta, but apparently they do not serve pasta at all. There is also no kid's menu. The pizza and chicken were a bit salty for our taste, it wasn't especially flavorful. Portions were good for two adults. We didn't feel that the cooking did Mario Batali's reputation any justice. It seems a bit like what any other restaurant can whip out and at a better cost value. I must commend though the servers and the manager, you can see that they are doing their best. Wish the food was better though
3
I was very excited to eat here given that 1) I love pizza; 2) I'd never eaten at a celebrity chef restaurant before; 3) Mario Batalli is one of my favorite celebrity chefs, his food always seems delicious. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed in this experience.My wife and I each ordered a pizza. I opted for a simple margherita, whereas she went for a pizza with prosciutto and arugula. The pizza was decent, the highlight being the crust, which was thin and crispy. The sauce was OK, and you could see it had a different taste to it than what you usually get at other places, but different isn't necessarily better. It was good, but nothing that special. I found my pizza to be lacking in cheese. So overall, pretty average pizza, at a not so average price. I've had better pizza for much cheaper at countless other establishments, so if you're looking for pizza, save your money and go elsewhere
3
My wife and I patronised this restaurant before our visit to the ArtScience Museum. We had a Wings Diavola (which is a an entree pasti of 4 chicken wings) and a Benno Pizza (which is a pizza with ham, pineapple etc).In terms of the food, we think it's very average. You can find better pizza at the Pontini restaurant at Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel. For the chicken wings, you can easily find better ones at Newton circus hawker center. In terms of the service, we find it very average. If not for the mandatory 10% service charge, seriously, we think it's probably worth less tips. Can give this place a miss and have your meals elsewhere before a visit to the Marina Bay Sands

Having recently returned from a trip to Italy, we've been avoiding Italian restaurants for fear of being disappointed. Finally went there with a couple of friends who were visiting Singapore - ex New Yorkers, who are big fans of Mario Batali. We're glad we did... the restaurant was fabulous - from the cool ambience to the thoughtful service and of course the delicious food! It's on the steep side, but worth it for the quality. We went on a Monday night - the restaurant was nearly full (we couldn't get through on the phone to reserve a table earlier that evening), but we got lucky. You'd be well-advised to book in advance. They were very accommodating of our friends' 6 month old and offered to provide a high chair for the baby. The waiter was very helpful and answered numerous queries with a smile, and gave multiple recommendations which were spot on. Another thing to note is that there are enough options on the menu for vegetarians as well. The restaurant carried only Italian wines, so we couldn't get a Riesling Kabinett that we were looking for, but the sommelier made a good recommendation.We tried a couple of items from the mozzarella bar as appetizers - burricotta with artichokes and pine nuts and mozzarella with pesto, tapenade, etc. For the mains we had tortellini with chicken liver and truffles, some wagyu beef, ricotta and egg raviolo and an eggplant pasta. Rounded off with some chocolate bombolini for dessert... everything was EXCELLENT.BTW, it seems that their menu has been updated - the menu we got at the restaurant is slightly different from the one online.We're definitely going back to this one - look out for my tasting menu review next time! :-

My colleague and I visited Pizzeria and Osteria Mozza in the Marina Bay Sands shopping complex since we both had a desire for Italian and I especially some good pizza. The food did not dissappoint but the price was very hight. $37 Sing for my pizza (good meat pizza with Fennel Sausage, Salumi, etc) and a special on the lasagna that evening for $30 Sing. Both were very good but you are paying for the privilege of eating at a famous chefs restaurant. I could and have gotten similar quality and taste in New Haven at Pepe's or some other local Italian eatery. This is typical in Singapore...hight quality restaurants in the big complexes charge good money. Get used to it if you don't want to eat at the Asian food courts every night. The place was packed and we were lucky enough to wait for 1/2 hour and got a table by the window where we could people watch as they shopped in the mall...very interesting and entertaining
5
No doubt the greatest Rustic Northern Italian cuisine on the planet.A mirror image of the Los Angeles establishment,with well trained staff.From the moment you are greeted until the final goodbye,it is pure heaven.We were lucky enough to meet the man putting all the great presentations before us,Chef David Almany.If you looked up commitment to fine dining, you would find his picture.To Will,Owen, Paul and of course Ms Jennifer Beech,the finest hostess anywhere, a well deserved tip of the hat to you all.Continued success and our best wishes
4
The restaurant seems to have a bit of an identity crisis: the inside looks fine dining, with low lights and dark wood paneling everywhere. However, its open space facing into the mall, plus ridiculous rock music makes it feel like a slightly more upscale version of tgi Friday's. Food is very good though: try the roasted fig starter and the pastas. The Iberian pork chop was excellent as well. Service is friendly, though wait staff tends to get easily distracted and over explain everything--even informing me that the wine I chose was red! Would go back for the food but not really a place I would intentionally plan of going to
5
Amazing cheese and pasta! Great service! Good prices! Best Italian we hadcin a long time!
5
We are an expat family that has lived in Singapore for about 10 years now and have been waiting for a "big city" restaurant to open here in SIngapore. Finally its has. We were immediately greeted by amazing, friendly, passionate and hospitable staff. Just like service staff in New York. We started with a delicious glass of Prosecco, Italian sparkling wine that got our tast buds roaring ! There were 5 of us ( we went without the kids) and ordered about 4 ANTIPASTI which was perfect for a party of our size. We got the Octopus, some burrata cheese dish with Leeks, a crispy pigs trotter, and a buffalo mozzarella dish. All extraordinary!!!! You can tell the chef puts in a lot of extra hours sourcing these amazing ingredients. The Octopus was a little salty but as I love salt it was perfect! Plus the captain informed us that the Chef does not put any salt on the dish, just seafood goodness plus as informed you must eat each bite of the Octopus with a bite of the green salad below. For next course it was pasta!! We got two family portions split for the 5 of us which was perfect. We got a Bucatini dish with a red sauce and a small meat ravioli in a light butter sauce. They were topped with cheese at our table which was a nice addition to the service. Best Pasta ever!!!!!! For the Main dishes of the night we got 4 mains for the table a duck with corn, a whole fish with grilled lemon, a rib eye steak ( best steak in the world) and a lamb dish with yogurt. All incredible. We had a little room left for dessert and ordered the Italian doughnut holes, and the chocolate cake plus a couple scoops of sorbet. With every course we had a different bottle of wine and they were all paired with the food perfectly. All in all this is not your typical Italian restaurant in Singapore, but maybe that is why is it is so good. Thank You Mozza we will be back soon!!!!!!!!

Best pizza in Singapore. Not a normal pizzeria for kids...mine hate it. Meatballs and wings too spicy for them and Margherita pizza is not cheesy enough for them.. The food is not kid friendly. But I love it, I don't think it's meant to be kid friendly. Good music and lots of bar seating make it great for a fun date or a night out with friends. Order everything for the table and share. US beer and Italian wine

A Mario Batali resto? We just couldn't resist!On our last trip to Singapore, we made reservations in Osteria Mozza as we wanted somewhere nice to go to celebrate hubby's birthday.When I made our reservations, I was told the dress code was "business", so I had expected a little more with the ambiance. I guess it didn't help that the resto's in the mall (and not enclosed in glass) and that many guests were casually dressed. But it was nonetheless a pleasant dining experience.They started us off with choices of bread plus olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Then we were treated to complimentary appetizers from the Mozarella bar. Hubby says it was really good (I couldn't have any cuz of preggy dietary restrictions).I had the Spaghetti alla Gricia and hubby had the Orecchiette with sausage & Swiss chard (which our server mentioned was one of their specialty pastas). Although I enjoyed my pasta (not the best I've had), my hubby's pasta was tastier.We had Torta della Nonna (chestnut honeycomb & pine nuts) for dessert--YUMMMY! This we enjoyed a lot.Bonus points--they surprised us with complimentary gelato complete with candle to celebrate hubby's birthday! (I had mentioned we were celebrating his birthday when I made the reservations as I wanted a good table).Bottomline, I'd give this resto a GO
2
I went for a dinner on the Pizza side restaurant and I was really expected something more.The quality of the food was very poor, the pizza was not cooked enough, in the menu it is written <Carrni > which means <Meat > in Italian but there was no meet only salami and ham (prosciutto) under the menu.It is too far expensive for what it is and not a very good copy of Italian food
5
Had a "merienda" or heavy snack at the Pizzeria Mazzo of Mario Batalli at the Marina Sands Singapore. It was worth the trip to the horribly crowded and maze like Marina Sands Hotel.The snack we had was fantastic. We ordered too much but finished off the food. The salad was excellent, the pizzas were distinctly Batali and the chicken wings was divine. Service was very good and the table settings were casual but did not let you forget that it is a pizzeria with fine pizzas. We would have loved to dine again at the Osteria Mazzo but it was so fully booked. In fact we were lucky to get a table at the Pizzeria. Call for reservations way way in advance to enjoy this fantastic place
3
Ordered take-away pizza from this restaurant, and the taste were pretty good with very crispy edge crust. But it is not a pizza that you would look forward to it. However, it is obvious much better taste than those of large chain pizza restaurant. The pizza were pricey, average about S$30++ for a 12 inches size.Cannot comment on the sit-in foods as I had not try them. Maybe next time
4
I went there invited by some friends. As a starter we had a wonderful octopus. Then a very good pasta and a not less good snaper. The wine (white and superb) was recommended by the manager - very good choice. Overall speaking, I'll repeat the experience
3
Small group of 8 in a private room. Set menu of $80/head and we didn't even get a full pizza each! Only one between two? So, shared entrees (good quality - not that big), shared salads, 4 pizzas (maybe 12 inch, not larger - ok, but had better in SG), and one dessert each. You do the math.Lesson - don't EVER get a set menu - it's just highway robbery. Or, just don't go to MBS - everything there is overpriced. And for a restaurant with a view of a...shopping mall? Best pizza restaurant in SG - you don't get out much do you....
4
Visited with wife and small kids late Sunday afternoon. Service was polite, but very difficult to flag down for requests after we initially ordered (4 different attempts). Food was very flavorful and delicious though I'll admit my kids who are used to Dominos and Pizza said they liked the pizza "just ok". I loved it though and also loved the 3 different vege a la carte items we ordered (potatoes, asparagus, and cauliflower) which were all cooked perfectly and accented extremely well with dips, herbs and great seasonings. Even the kids liked them. I ordered lasagne which the special on Sunday. It was melt-in-your-mouth rich and delicious. The prices are a bit on the high side but if you can tolerate the poor service you can enjoy some great food
3
During our stay in the Marina Bay Sands Hotel we had dinner at Mozza. Food and service were ok but the restaurant is rather expensive.
2
Pizzas were pretty but tasteless. Hard-to-cut crust, over priced. Disappointment. Restaurant was nice though.
1
Food is ridiculously overpriced.
Pizza is the worst ever, the dough is hard and chewy and the sauce seems some precooked pasta sauce. I wonder how they can call themselves pizzeria.
5
Being in Singapore for almost a week, we'd had our share of local and Asian inspired cuisine so decided to splurge on a 'celebrity' restaurant and Marina Bay Sands. We figured since Mario Batali only had an Osteria Mozza in Singapore and Los Angeles we'd give it a try. Boy, were we glad we did.First, the wait staff was probably the most efficient and friendly we'd had our entire time in Singapore. We never waited more than a minute when we needed something, our food and drinks came out promptly, and the staff was well aware of the items on the menu to make recommendations and pairing suggestions.We first ordered the grilled octopus (pretty amazing considering I'm not a big squid person) and an item from the mozzarella bar which was to die for (super fresh). I had a pasta which was quite obviously house made (maybe one of the best I've had since going to Italy) and my boyfriend the beef hanger steak which was cooked to perfection. We also had 2 shared sides (the broccoli and rosemary potatoes were AMAZING) and a mixed salad.We ended the meal with donut holes w/ fruit compote which was a great ending.I have to say the prices were not bad at all. Considering the amount of food we ordered, wine, coffee, dessert, plus tax and tip, we only spent about S$350 ($100 being for wine). Definitely recommend

Having been in Singapore for 14 years, there's been good pizzas, there's been mediocre ones, and the occasional one that wasn't really any good at all, the type even the dog would think twice about eating it, but it's cheap so it gets eaten. But I'd never truly experienced one that caused such a reaction that I would actively hate it. Until now.We ordered the Margherita, and the Ham & Pineapple one. The Margherita was extremely bitter tasting, with a weird bad red wine taste and smell to it. The only way to even eat it at all was to scrape all the sauce off. The ham & pineapple was "better", but still poor. The price was astronomical as well, up there above the priciest Singapore italian pizzerias.The kids hated them, I hated them, the wife hated them. Neither of the kids could take more than the first bite. , and we went outside later to get her a burger, with my son falling back on instant noodles from home once we got back. Having said that, the non-pizza food in this pizzeria was "Okay" but too salty, the salad was nice, but got a bit spicy by the bottom of it, and the crispy duck with lentils was also overly salty, even when eaten with the leaves and lentils it came with which actually made it taste better-ish, but the lentils don't go with the duck
5
but NOT cheap. Locates in the Mall of Marina Bay Sands; reservation is a must on the weekend. Went for dinner after touring the Museum. Ordered the Tricolore (frisee, arugula & radicchio) insalata with Parmigiano Reggiano-- done right and my favorite -- fluffy and light with a hint of anchovy dressing. Ordered the Artichoke al forno w/ ricotta toast.-- super yummy-- rich but not heavy, toast set atop baked artichoke and swiss chard in French Onion soup like broth. Children had the Lasagna--small portion for the price but good, and salami pizza loaded with salami- makes it a bit salty for my taste but the kids devoured it. We had the fennel, green onion, and sausage pizza-- perfect marriage of flavors. My only comment, not only applicable to this pizzeria but ALL pizzerias in Singapore, the crust is super thin thus, can't hold up the toppings when picked up. Can't wait to return to try other offerings. on the menu

After scanning TA from top to bottom whilst in Singapore my hubby and i couldnt decide where to eat on our last night in Sing. We asked everybody we knew in Singapore and got a variety of recommendations, when it all became too hard we thought we will go to one close in MBS as that is where we were staying. What a fabulous restaurant. The food was heavenly...i cannot rave enough about how good our meals were....and you MUST have one of the mozzarella appetizers, they are simply divine!!! Pasta exquisite....poultry cooked to perfection, seriously the food was soooo good. Service was fantastic and Owen (the GM) and his team seem to have it all together. Couple of downers. Wine list is huge and a little expensive and seems to only carry Italian wines (being aussies we always like to stick to our own wines..) However the Sommelier was quick to lend a hand and the recommendation was a divine Pinot Gris...Only other 'gripe' was the ridiculous music!!! When we first arrived i felt i had walked into a nightclub. The music was loud and quite housey...as the evening went on it improved a little, but to start with it was quite loud and doof doof.Having said that did i mention the food was soooooooo good? The music could have been heavy metal and i wouldnt have cared once the food arrived. Definitely will return and highly recommend if you like great rustic style Italian food

Your first impression of this resto must be quite nice. Interior design was nice, waiters look clean and educated. You look at the prices are a bit high for a pizza place. But what the hell it looked like a decent high end italian resto. So you give it a try. Anyway what can happen? Its Mario Battali's resto. This must be something.Then its just have a bitter ending.Food:Pizza was bad, worst than pizza hut!! Dough was tough, can barely swallow.Chicken wings was so so.Service:Just bad.When we order the waiter was very snob i reaaaallly feel like give her a slap in the face. The menu is half english half italian. Well heeeeeyyy i will ask few question. I know she might get that from most customer. Well i think thats is quite humane. Not evryone can speak italian!! Gosh im so pissed when i remember that moment!!After that its just went down the sewer! We are seated in the far corner of the bar. And it takes a shout to get the attention of the waiter. Your waving will not do it.Its a shame. I mean its a decent resto, but i just reach my limit.Me n husband are decent people, being treated as an idiot is not the smartest way for a resto with foreign menu.I sohould have written down that idiot waiter

My friend and I were looking for a restaurant to go to before going to The Lion King. We walked passed Osteria Mozza, glanced at the menu, and decided to give it a try. We left absolutely stuffed, all smiles (which could have been the wine, haha), and definitely satisfied.When you go to Osteria Mozza, know upfront that it is a bit pricey and that to get the full experience, you will probably have to spend some money. You definitely need to get the mozzarella cheese appetizer (warm, melted, creamy)--delicious. I had the yellowtail fish while my partner had the duck; we shared gnocchi. We both couldn't stop raving about whose dish was better. The waiter suggested a nice Pinot Grigio that paired perfectly with the meal.The wait staff had impeccable service. They knew we needed to get to a performance, so they made an obvious effort to make sure we were able to make it in time. I highly recommend Osteria Mozza! Bon Appetite! A must try

Its my third attempt to try this restaurant, the first two time was full house and we were rejected. Finally we get to enter the restaurant on a saturday at 1230pm, by then all the tables were occupied, and we were told to sit at the side counter table. The utensils were put in a nice envelop and stories of Italy were wrote on the menu. We ordered 1 appetizer, 1 salad and 1 pizza. The red ^ yellow chilly stuffed with tuna was totally delicious, many kinds of pizza to choose from. We had a 3kinds of meat pizza, n the size wasnt that big for 2 person
