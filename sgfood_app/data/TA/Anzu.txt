Good food and very reasonable price. Presentation of food really good and service was fantastic. Portion although small but enough to fill your stomach. Generous with their inhouse salad. Location near orchard mrt about 5 minutes walk. Highly recommended.

Dined here twice during a 4 days stay. All meals were bit expensive but excellent quality. Did not get to try lunch special (limited 20 set lunch at SG$15), but lots people were having and look fantastic.
Must try for all authentic Tonkatsu lovers.

Value for money set lunch at 15+. Only 20 sets everyday. Lots of variety in small portion to sample. Great and friendly service too.

I had a fantastic "service lunch" which reminded me of mini kaisekis. The set had more than 10 food items served un colorful porcelain for the very reasonable price of $15:) I love the fried prawn prawn covered in a tartare-tasting sauce. The chawanmushi was perfectly smooth n delicately seasoned. I look forward to going back for more

Went with the family on a Sunday night for dinner. Restaurant was not full when we arrived. After selecting the dishes we want to order we are told the niku-jaga was not available. We went with some thing else but that was not a good start. We were offered two types of rice, we ordered the mixed rice. Receiving the food to a long time and the dishes came piece meal. On top of that, the mixed rice was not easy yet so we got white rice to start with. By the time we were 2/3 through the meal, the mixed rice came- but only one order. The soup was also wrong I.e. not as ordered. And the quality was average at best - we had the premium katsu and the regular katsu and must say the normal version is better.

We ordered an oyster and pork set and a claypot set. I couldn't finish it and left half of it uneaten. Both pork that was dry and tough. I would say you can easily find better katsu restaurants in Singapore. E.g. Tanpopo, Ootoya, Tonkichi. Avoid this place

Decided to try Anzu this time in the newly opened Japanese food court in Wilsma Atria. Restaurant was 40% full but had to wait 10 minutes before somebody came to see us at the entrance. Took another 10 minutes to give us a table. Got the menus straight away. After that service went further down - took time to get somebody to take order, 3 reminders before we got our drinks. Food took another 20 minutes. I wonder what would have happened if the place was full. The restaurant specializes in Tonkatsu. Food was excellent and prices very reasonable. Wish they could employ more people and improve on the service

Decided to try lunch at the restaurant today. Turns out to be quite a gem. The limited lunch set main consists of 3 types of ingredients (meat, vegetables and seafood), with steamed egg, rice and miso soup. Wife had a tea-rice set. Waiter was very sincere and patiently explained how to go about enjoying the tea-rice set. Food is very well-prepared and presented. Everyone should go try the dishes

The tonkatsu is prepared the same way as in Tokyo. The portions in the set meal (inclusive of miso-shiro, chawan mushi, tsukemono and salad, for 15sgd) are perfect! Service is good too; the chef goes out of his way to please customers (just like in Japan). Ate a second time during the same week; this time, we ordered a pork loin katsu set, and a katsu hotpot (both for 52.80sgd). HIghly recommendable

I'm glad I gave Anzu a second chance. Wasn't very impressed with the pork loin during my first visit but this time, they wowed me with the ebi! It's crispy on the outside and well done on the inside (i.e. not overcooked). Pork loin is above average, though I've had better ones.
