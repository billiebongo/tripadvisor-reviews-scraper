We had the pork rib both and rice and noodles for dinner. Great food well priced. We are not Chinese but we loved it. Great service and experience.

I really enjoyed the pork ribs at this place. The meat is tender, the soup is peppery but not too much (for me), and the service is quite good as they refill your bowl whenever the broth gets low.

Review by Dr Sim. Good Pork Rib Soup. Tight seating. A bit pricey. Tourists can visit. Enjoyed the food. Service is quick but basic. Regards Dr Sim

It was an average meal below my expectation. Being listed in michelin i would have expected the best. Long queue to get this. Well the tea was good
5
We literally came here 15 min before they open to avoid the line, 10 min sitting down is already FULL HOUSE.I enjoy the soup, the aroma of the herb used is very unique. I strongly suggest try with the noodle, The other side dishes offered was overcooked. The kidney in the soup was average. The soup base is one of the best ( to salty side)..we took home 2 boxes of the herb to duplicate at home.. ( almost same!

Founder of Song Fa BKT Yeo Eng Song started serving bak kut teh from a pushcart stall in 1969. Nowadays Song Fa no longer operate from a pushcart but promise the same original fall-off-the-bone tender pork ribs experience. Sadly what we had was far from that. Our premium loin ribs looked impressive but the meat was super tough and dry. The standard ribs were surprisingly much softer and flavoursome. The soup was not overwhelmingly peppery but just enough to make you sweat. Not the best bkt place we've been to unfortunately and there's nothing that would entice us to come back anytime soon

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh chain restaurants are both popular for many Singaporeans and visitors since 1969. The founder Mr Yeo Eng Song diligently started out as an assistant in a stall selling the traditional Teochew dish. Today, the family has 7 restaurants dotted around Singapore. The dishes we had were delicious- fish broth soup, pork belly stir fry. No beer sold here. Don‚Äôt arrive late this restaurant closes around 9pm. Although you have to line up, diners move in and out quickly. Cheapish prices around $25AUD including rice and green tea.

This is a diner dedicated almost entirely to a local soup called Bak Kuh Teh (pronounced BACK KOO TAY, called BKT by locals). It is a spicy white spare rib soup made with secret herbs and white pepper. The soup is served hot, and the broth is frequently refilled from a big kettle, like tea.There is no furnishings to speak of. Diners sit on wooden stools on small narrow benches. And, given the climate, it can be hot eating here. Bring tissues as napkins are skimpy here. Patrons almost always have to stand in line. There are two restaurants sitting side by side. One with airconditioning, one without. There are no reservations, and we waited about 10 minutes. Service is terrific. We ordered while standing in line and our food was delivered almost as soon we sat down. The BKT tastes divine. The spiciness is intended for flavor, not punishment, so the soup is almost addictive. The ribs are boiled but taste like an important part of the soup.Side dishes include boiled peanuts and boiled green vegetables. Make sure to order sublime fried dough (yotiao) deep fried in coconut oil. It's impossibly crispy and a Southeast Asia only specialty

When i crave for bah kut teh, i normally head over to Song Fa. Love the soup; only problem is always crowded and that somehow cause the quality of tenderness of the pork ribs too Don't forget to add on some iconic side dishes ‚Äî options include braised peanuts, preserved vegetables, braised pork knuckle and Braised Pig's trotter. Sometimes I love this trio more than the ribs ;

The meat on the ribs are so tough and dry. The soup is full of pepper taste and lack the sweetness of a proper pork rib soup.
Can skip !

The restuarant is very near mrt clarke quay station crossing the Central mall. Good food and fast if you come before lunch time a bit.

We were in queue for lunch and surprise that when we were next in Q the service staff skip us and take in the next group with the same number of customers. When we asked why so, then we were told our other members were not in the Q. Yes they were just busy parking their cars and were expected to arrive anytime. The situation could be better managed if the system been made clear or instead of rudely skipping customer in the Q to the next, give clear explanation first and seek their u derstanding

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh. This place at New Bridge Road has been thriving since the day it had opened years ago and it‚Äôs renowned for the best bak kut teh in town ,Together with the best pork ribs soup .The meat is very tender, come apart easily. The herbs and seasoning seeps into the meat. Overall it is very good and very satisfying. The broth is sweet and juicy, it has a few boiled garlic in it, but the taste of the garlic is not too strong, which is nice. The staffs are friendly, nothing out of the ordinary, they will ask how your meal was, which is nice as well. The foods are rather fast to be served. The place is not too big, evenly spaced between tables, In conclusion it‚Äôs a street food that I would unquestionably recommend to my friends or any tourists to visit

Most often visit food shop in Singapore, one of my favourite food when spend time during weekend.Pork lib soup alway hot and have more taste.If you don't like vegetable, this shop is most recommendedCome to visit early morning then you can seat easie

We did not try it here. Instead, it was at their nearby outlet in Chinatown Point.Service is brisk and efficient at weekday lunch. What we liked : the pork loin ribs, pig stomach and liver, the soup refills for any of your orderWhat we disliked : too peppery, may turn off some people.A reasonable price for this type of food

Visited early in the evening about 6 pm had to queue, busy with business people, tourists, locals, amazing place. The pork rib soup is full of tender tasty pork ribs, they continuously bring the broth around in a big tea pot to top you up - no frills, but a fab experience to see how the locals eat fantastic food at a ridiculously low price

It might interest you to know that they charge an exorbitant fee of 1SGD for a packet of wet tissue which I absolutely think is a rip-off. They do not inform diners about the charge. Food was so-so, service was hurried. Not a loss if you haven't tried eating here. Go have bak kut teh somewhere else

I had a bloody good lunch here.
The pork soup, soft peanuts, salted vegetables and bread were all delicious.
Service is very prompt and prices reasonable. Very Highly recommended
5
we got this restaurant in my country but no one can compare to the original one! the soup and the ribs and my fav which is salted vegetables are taste the best here
5
fragrant boiled pork ribs is what Bak Kut The is about- very popular but still authentic- great price- nothing fancy- great eats

Souper nice bak kut teh üëç Free soup refill, generous serving, attentive staff, comfy place due to the air coolers. Will be back soon..

Walking distance from the Clarke Quay MRT station. We went to the branch with indoor seating, not the corner branch. The queue was long but moved fast so we were seated inside in no time. We just ordered the Bak Kut Teh and rice. Unlimited hot broth, delicious pork meat to the bone. We bought their to-go Bak Kut Teh flavor herbal packets (said to be the same flavor used in their restaurant) and tried it when we came home to the Philippines, strictly following the easy instructions available at the back of the packet. Just pork ribs, garlic, water, and the herbal packs- very delicious too

Brought a group of overseas friends from a workshop there for dinner. Ordered a variety of items due to our big group size. Food was nice and love the soup. Especially nice was that the soup could be replenish without charges for unlimited times. Love the hot soup
5
The title says it all. Good food, served almost immediately. Service is quick and efficient. This Bak kut teh is special. A must try. I have spoken to a few friends who have eaten here and some of them do not agree with the taste. So I would think that the kind of bak kut teh served here splits opinions. From my point of view though, its split to the positive end. I would go back for more.

If the queue was any indication of what was in store with number 096 in the queue and a 20 minute wait for a table was worth it. The hot soup refills and the soy sauce with the spare ribs was soft the meat falling off the rack
5
Best bak kut teh I've had anywhere. Soup is peppery and refreshing, and they give free refills. There are 2 branches near each other on New Bridge Road, I prefer this one (11 New Bridge Road) at the road corner, near Clarke Quay. Its more airy and seems to be less crowded than the other one at 17 New Bridge Road

Of all the BKT I've had around Singapore, I only ever enjoy 333 at Balestier road or Song Fa... And Song Fa is really the only one I keep coming back to. IMO, even Founders has gone down the tubes, so I don't even bother anymore. Song Fa is affordable, it's tasty, and the service is prompt, attentive and friendly. I've never had a problem at SF, and the food is always consistently good. The soup is delicious and is always topped up (I don't even have to wave for someone to TOP it up!) after a polite "more soup sir?" (Or a shorter, polite Singlish / Chinese version ) the staff at Clarke Quay are Super friendly and quick. I've even seen loads of non-Singaporeans eating there.Just note that they don't take credit card, only cash or nets, so come ready with money
