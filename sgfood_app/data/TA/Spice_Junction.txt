We go there once in a week. Food is delicious and service is excellent. This is the only place I could find to taste authentic Kerala food..

Highly recommended, and a pleasure to be in. Excellent service along with very tasteful & fresh food. Been here several times, the most authentic Kerala restaurant in Singapore. The food is delicious with a Homely feeling.

Bad service . Extremely slow . Takes forever to get the ordered food that is if they remember .
Food was average . Nothing great . But definitely not worth the wait.

Been here several times. Food is delicious.
Nice environment to peacefully sit and enjoy the food, specially for couples.

There was only one other table when we visited, which should have been a sign that the food is nothing special; which turned out to be true. Fish didn't seem fresh, lamb was quite tough. Service was OK, but I would not go back there in a hurry. Perhaps it was an off night

Went for an early dinner, had Appam and a Kerala parata - the stew was good but the Aviyala and Bitter Guard Theeyal we ordered were not that great. The price is on the higher side to what the quality/taste is, esp. the Avial was a kind of spoiled a bit probably made for lunch that they continued to serve, it was not fresh so I had to ask them to take that away

We had our family dinner here on 31 May . There were 7 of us. This is our 2nd time dining here but this time around, the food came out way faster ( which is a good thing) .The service was good. We were attended to pretty quickly by the waiter today.The food items ordered : Plain Rice - 1 portion can be shared by 2 paxChicken Briyani - This actually took the longest to come Prawn Masala AvialVendakkaa VazhattiyathuChicken Korma - Cashew based gravyEgg BriyaniSquid Pepper FryFish Curry - This was AMAZING!Mutton Coconut Fry - Another winning dishPomfret Fry - Most expensive dish but SO WORTH IT. MUST TRY.Nadan Chicken RoastCheese Porata - YummyIce cream Salt LassiKing Fisher Bucket ( 2 buckets )Fresh Lime Juice Total "Damages" = $320.70 including svc charge.Absolutely loved all dishes and I believe they used lesser or if not, no MSG in their dishes

Its a nice restaurant with pretty decent interiors and good number of kerala dishes. Refer my ratings (on a scale of 10) mentioned below, for better understanding.- Menu : 7/10 - Location : 7.5/10 (Located on race course road, between Farrer Park MRT and Little India MRT)- Interiors : 7/10- Service : 9/10- Food : 6/10 (Food is not really tasty as is the case with kerala items. I mean it does not satisfy your taste buds, though you feel full on stomach)- Overall value for money : 6/1

Being here few times now, we love it, not usual common Indian food you find everywhere. This is more close to Sri Lankan type food with spicy level bit on higher side, used of coconut milk. Love it.If you decide to dine her, get kappa with mutton or beef, try appam (hoppers) fish curry, "Parota" wow the best we had in Singapore so far, most or all the places is made with too much of oil. We love it at SJ.Prices are reasonable. For family of 4 with good amount of dishes not too little not too much (rice for 1, Appam for 1, Parota for 2, 3 dishes of curries/sides) and drinks such as lassy. You will get a bill around S$75/-

We went with my overseas friends for dinner. have seen this restaurant lot of times while roaming around Little India and its the first time we were visiting this place. Food was nice, felt you were having real Kerala style food. People were friendly. Our Chinese friend liked the food so much. Will recommend this restaurant

If you happen to be in Singapore craving Kerala food this is the place to be. The food was excellent. Food was hot and had perfect spice. Fish curry and fish fry was awesome. The staff and service was good.
5
Great food in an interesting nighttime area. Excellent service. Authentic, not too large or touristy. Not frightened to spice it up on request
5
Home made taste especially fish curry and curd curry etc. puttu vellapam and other kerala foods are not forgettable.
and also another plus point . Beverages are available

The restaurant itself is well placed along many eateries along Singapore's famous Racecourse Road.A pleasant and welcoming restaurant where myself, my wife and a friend had a early lunch. The food is a blend of South Indian delights, reasonably priced and the service was very good. Plenty of waiting staff on hand to deal with anything the customers wanted, attentive and friendly.The food was good quality although if truth be told, there are other places in Little India which offer South Indian food which I would personally rate a little better.We had a mixture of mutton, prawn, cutlets and Appams and a couple of deserts. I would recommend this place for sure for first timers
3
I found it pretty average restaurant in terms of food taste , ambience and service. My entire impression revolves around the fact that ordered a Kerala parota (in a Kerala restaurant) and it was neither fluffy not soft. Curry dishes were good. Overall , its fine to visit onc
5
This place is a must try for anyone wanting to try out Kerala Cuisine in Singapore.The Parattas are crispy and yummy. Kerala Style Beef Fry is mouthwatering .The Thali meals is real good bargain if you are at the Spice during lunch time.Highly recommend
5
This is an awesome place for South Indian Food. If you are Fish/Curry lover, there is no place like this in Singapore. Managed by Keralites, they serve the most authentic South Indian food in the town, the best meal we had in Singapore so far. Highly recommended for South Indian/Fish & Curry lover. There is nothing like "Fish Curry Kerala Meals" and "Sambharam" in the town. Awesome. Huzay

This is a cute little restaurant at Little India, Singapore that serves Kerala food. The ambience is very good with a friendly staff..if you are looking for food rich in Aromas, various spices, I would recommend this restaurant for you...Kerala is a small state in the south of India, well known for its back waters and its food.."Karimeen pollichathu" is a famous Kerala dish that you can try at this restaurant..

We went to this place based on a recommendation from a friend.Being from Kerala really enjoyed the Parotta, Appam, Kadla Curry and Malabar Prawn curry. The multi-layed Parotta was fluffy and tasty and the Appam was really nice. The service was fast, personal and the food is relatively inexpensiveWe will going back to this place again and agai

Was hungry wandering around Race Course Road, but had to go for dinner in a couple of hours. Saw this, went in, and ordered Appam and chicken stew. food came in quickly- I was the only customer at 6 PM. Excellent Appam, and very good chicken stew. They had a lot more appetising dishes, but I could not eat too much. (Hint: getting ready for a big dinner in a fancy place)Good service. low price. What more to ask

This one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Good kerala food. Decent ambiance and friendly staffs. It's little expensive compared to other kerala restaurants we have in Singapore.
Recommended dishes: puttu biriyani, prawns fry, mathi fry!

Yummy biryanis, excellent fried chicken with prota! This place has become a regular with me. The owner ensures efficiency, has a pleasant demeanor and thus good customer service. This definitely needs more attention!

This is now my go to place for Kerala food. I have tried the nai chorru with mutton stew, and on another occasion the thali with fish curry. Have either washed it down with a cold beer or the moru (chilled buttermilk with spices and green chili). Portions are reasonable, and service has always been friendly. The manager Sunil is always very attentive, as were the other staff on each occasion I visited. All in, a great value

I used to like Spice Junction. They gave some competition to "Swadisht" just a lane away in the "Kerala Cuisine" category.You could have nice Sadhyas on Onam and Vishu (regional festivals in Kerala, India), always walk in for some Kerala Porotta, Kappa and Meen curry.Competitively speaking, I always thought Spice Junction had the upper hand - better location, more space, better interiors, etc.With time however, all that faded away. What remains is a Kerala restaurant that is happy to dish out subpar dishes and hope to charge a small premium for offering a niche cuisine. I certainly saw that attitude when I called to ask for their catering rates.Swadisht seems to have benefitted from this downfall without doing much on their end. Kerala customers seem to be flocking towards the smaller, Swadisht in much larger numbers now.Sad... I wish they went back to being the super nice Kerala food place they once were

Quite surprised by the other reviews. Perhaps at one point of time, this restaurant had good food and service. I had a vastly different experience.Took 10 minutes to even get the menu. Asked for chapati, no chapati. Asked for naan, no naan. Asked for tea, no tea. Asked for coffee, no coffee. Asked for water, it took 15 minutes to come. And that was after we asked twice.All this can be forgiven if the food was fantastic. The chicken curry was pretty bland. Everything else (chicken briyani and fish curry set) was mediocre. On a positive note the paratha was crispy and large.My advice would be to go to gayathri or muthus curry. They're more expensive but have better food and service

I'm a regular at Spice Junction. The wait staff and especially, the woner, Sunil, are very friendly. I usually order their fish curry meals that comes with brown rice, sambar. a couple of side dishes and a dessert. Friends swear by their fish biriyani. I've also tried their puttu and kadala. Overall, a great place for lunch

At times Little India in Singapore feels more authentic Indian than India itself! Because of restaurants like Spice Junction. A friend asked what kind of food I wanted to have for our lunch meeting. Not an easy question to answer in Singapore, which to me is the food paradise of the world. Having just flown in from the U.S., I needed some home food for comfort. So I said a good and simple Indian meal, not too heavy, would be great. I was more than satisfied with the Kerala Thali with fish curry. The food was very authentic Kerala. Service was great. The only minor discomfort for me -- I had arrived from the East Coast just that morning -- was that the room felt a bit warm and humid, but it wasn't bad at all

My family and I went to Spice Junction a fortnight back and came back very disappointed. We've been there before and the quality was very good then. This time it was clearly bad. We ordered a south Indian thali meal and the food wasn't tasty at all. Some where too tasty, the others were not fresh. Previously we ordered parotta, puttu and kadala curry etc. They were all nice, but rice thali, something for which Kerala is famous for, was bad. The air con wasn't working and we were sweating profusely on a hot sunny day. Could be better

@TheKuoKnowsGet ready to have your taste buds tickled, if you should step into Spice Junction.The aptly-named restaurant combines spices in just the right proportions to produce some of the tastiest Kerala dishes.The Malabar Chicken Biryani simply leaves other biryanis wondering where they went wrong. Its understated appearance belies a burst of flavours and tender chicken pieces that are not only enticingly excellent but excellently enticing.The Fish Moily might look like just another korma clone. But it is not. The subtle combination of the five "C"s, namley, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves, and a hint of chillies infused in coconut milk produces a tantalisingly-good curry. Eat it with appam - Kerala's answer to hotcakes - and it could leave you wanting more... and more....and more.Service at Spice Junction can be a little slow at times. But it is worth the wait.

This is probably the best Keralite restaurant outside of Kerala. Actually scratch that – this restaurant is as good as any restaurant in Kerala !!Clearly the place has great choices for non-vegeterians – fish wrapped in a leaf, mango curry prawns and chicken biryani are some of my wife’s favourites. But even a vegetarian like me is never disappointed – I normally dig into Appams, vegetable stew, uli theeyal and the thali (available only for lunch). To me, what sets this place apart is the authentic taste and freshness of ingredients – something which reminds me of good ol home-cooked food. I am a bit surprised that this place is not super popular yet – but I guess its just a matter of time. But please remember it is a family-run kind of place, so service can be a bit slow and ambience is not exactly breathtaking. But if you want to taste good Kerala food, don’t think twice. Tip - If you are going in a big group, it may be a good idea to ring them up in advance so that they are adequately prepared

Tried the appam, mutton stew and gobi manchurian. While the manchurian was not bad the stew was too watery and the appam was too thick at the bottom. I could not find enough reason to visit this place again.

Authentic Kerala food in Singapore.
Appam, stew, kappa theal, kadala curry, pootu , parippu paisam all were mouth watering and excellent. It appeared as though we were in kerala.
4
A dish not to be missed 'Naadan Kozhi Porichathu' (Kerala style chicken fry). This is a wonderful dish. Also try Seafood Biriyani, quite delicious. Try Spice Junction special Ice Lemon Tea

We had a very tasty kerala sadya here. Good place in Little India. It was not too crowded, probably because we went on a working day. A good place to visit if you feel like having authentic kerala style food.
5
Owned and operated by an expatriate Keralite, the meals at Spice Junction are authentic, tasty, and good value. Service is great, although the decor is - well, very clean but boring. A good choice for family and friends.
5
This is the third time I have been to this restaurant and they have been consistent with their great food quality.
My favorites: meen polichadhu, fish curry, kerala parotta, sambharam.
5
A friend took us here, saying it was "light" Indian food. It was only after we got our food that we understood what he meant. Each of the sauces was different, and excellent. And none of them were heavily laden with oil as is so often the case. One of the best Indian meals I've enjoyed inside or outside India

We were greeted with a warm smile which gave a very pleasant feeling, but that was all to cherish for......The place was very stuffy with the aircon totally non-effective. It even stopped once and had to be restarted.Service was extremely slow with a person wanting to take order after 15 minutes of already having ordered. We had ordered a typical Kerala dish of Appam, mutton stew and chicken korma. Taste was good though the mutton had a slightly boiled taste. But what happened later was out of the world. We ordered a Biryani and after 15 minutes and one re-confirmation in between, we were informed that they have run out of Biryani. Really could not understand why it took them so long to tell us. We ordered a repeat of Appam and had to wait for eternity before it finally arrived. All these happened while the Restaurant was less than half full. Even though the Manager was apologetic for the mess, we left the restaurant with a sour tast

We went here with a lot of expectations, but the overall experience was disappointing. Service and atmosphere was good, but it is the quality of the food which was way off mark. We ordered puttu (kerala style steam cake), karimeen pollichatu (pearlspot fish covered in plantain leaf), traditional kerala chicken curry and kappa (tapioca).... puttu was extremely bad with a horrible texture. The non veg too was not good. Items were overly spicy and were not done properly. The restaurant boasts off visits of kerala cinestars, but I wonder whether they appreciated the food served...not at all good enough for the money we paid....all in all a forgettable experience

Service was lovely, owner (I think) came to double check on us when we ordered Vindaloo level 7 hot explained the spice level before sending order to kitchen (very thoughtful). 7 was just fine, slight sweat and runny nose without killing the taste buds. Fantastic veggie samosas light crunchy pastry. Saffron rice nicely spices not just yellow, chicken jalfrezi and garlic naan equally yummy
