Visited for the first time and was impressed with food especially the burgers and my friends was impressed also.

This place is recommended by my friend, quite happy I can make table reservation online using Chope.

Everything was good(lovely burgers) except for the rainbow cake dessert which looked great but was dry and hard.
5

Sat upstairs because it was a bit hot that day. It was nice with no one else up there. Casual place. Only had some drinks for a quick chat. Haven't tried the food yet. Wish they had some fresh fruit juices... cold pressed would be best.

Went to this ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù for lunch.Waitress needed to walk away for her ‚Äúmoment‚Äù before she even took my order. She was so lazy, it was like she was annoyed that I was asking her for something special. I have rarely seen worse service. Still no interest in what was going on in the restaurant at which she was effectively the host.Ordered food. Had to leave my table to ask for cutlery and napkins. And that took another 5 minutes, as if I was really asking for something special.Drink arrived at table. Warm. Needed a lot of ice. It was a can of Coke Zero, I‚Äôm not asking for something special here.Pizza arrived. Terrible. This was a pre-made pizza that had been fried (who fries a pizza base?) and then put onto a wooden platter to fake a real pizza.I have to say, I ate one slice and left the rest. It was simply disgusting. Who adds oil to a pizza base? Imbeciles.Really just a very poor experience.Staff and management need to close. This restaurant should die
4
Good burgers, good selection and serving size is satisfying. The jalape√±o poppers were very good! I am avid burger fan, to my standards, I think the beef taste and juices could have been stronger. Good service. Overall a good place and surely worth a visit if you are in the area. Great place to visit in the evening.
4
It was an experience that I almost did not get to enjoy due to the crowd which I think could be the one downside of this place. However, there are multiple solutions to solve this issue. One of them is an app, Waitrr where I simply choose my food and pay via this app
3
The seafood platter is fresh & the burger is delectable - fresh juicy beef patty.
That is their Rainbow latte that is beautifully presented. Not on their menu, need to request for it.
3
The drinks nice and super expensive...
Spicy red Burger was deference taste. Overall it was gd experience.
4
The meal is good, the price okay, the ambience is so so because it is so open to the street where people walk and passing. When we came they gave voucher for dessert in their linked group restaurant.
5
Such helpful and friendly employees :) great juice and coffee! Ordered a latte and got an extra espresso! Employee pointed us in the right direction for our further travels
2
Typical "western" food you'd find all over Asia. So, not great if you're from a Western country but the locals seem to love it. Service is sub-standard & pretentious, which at least is consistent with the hipster establishments in Australia which they seem to be trying to emulate
2
Went to I Am to celebrate 2 colleagues birthday. Ordered a platter to share, fries, 3 pastas & 2 burgers. Our mains took quite a while to arrive. Last to be delivered was our 2 burgers. By the time we got the burgers, a colleagues had finished her pasta. Burger buns were not toasted...beef patties were hot though. Cheese on the burgers didn't melt thru. Personally, I will not be returning to I Am. There are other better pastas & burger place around the area
3
this is quite a nice place. we dropped by for a quick dinner after shopping at haji lane. the menu is western (pizza, pasta, burgers, steak). the mock tails are not too bad. the service is good. the waiter was patient and gave recommendations on the pizza and drinks. the shrimp loco pizza we ordered was quite good - thin crusted. it is al fresco dining, so it was nice to sit and eat and enjoy the evening. get a table on the other side (not the main area) - a good place to people watch
4
Celebrated a friend's birthday here and we ordered the burgers and pasta. Good food, good service and great that the place where we were seated is air-conditioned (on the second floor). Reservations are also accepted which is good for planning meet ups with friends here too
3
Tried the chicken linguine pasta along with the special Belle's chili bun burgers. Pasta had a lot of delicious meat for its buck, but the sauce got quite salty towards the end. Burger was pretty good, as its patties and buns had a complementary mix of spices and oils. Mocktails are quite ordinary and little in quantity. Also, sitting along the roadside of Haji Lane to eat cafe food has its own appeals, just try not to visit when it's raining, as the number of working seats will decrease
3
Does that boss burguer on the menu look good to you? Ok, let me tell you one thing: it‚Äôs just not worth it.The burguer sells for 18 SGD. Now having that the thing they put on top of the patty isn‚Äôt real bacon; that the mayo is good, but not great; that the patty itself is overcooked; and that if you add a drink, plus service, plus taxes, your bill will get to 25 SGD; would you buy it?I had seen this place many times and wanted to try it, but it was just not worth it. It‚Äôs nice, food it‚Äôs average though and prices are two high for quality here in Singapore
4
Burgers were good, this place is not the cheapest but food was tasty and it was a welcome respite from the heat. It was reasonably quiet when we were there over a weekday lunch so service was prompt, no complaints.
5
The food was nice and worth the money. Was given a long table for 8 instead of for 6 which we initially booked. Overall üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
5
This is a great place to eat informally. Burgers were excellent and Mocktails were also really good.
Seasoning in burger patties added to the flavour.
Well worth visiting.
5
Nice place to chill out on a Firday night with friends.
Reserve seats in advance to avoid disappointment.
5
Perfect place for meet-up of friends and family
Nice ambience and pleasant staff. Good service rendered.
5
Service personal cater to our needs when we need them and apologise for their mistake. We were given bright smile as well
5
First time being placed on tbe second floor, i think the atmosphere is rather good. Enjoy eating tbe food as well it was good just that the portion seems abit lil? Love the drinks definitely! service can be a little bit better and more willing i gues
5
Only learnt of this restaurant from my Friend. We came with reservation on the second floor and realised that the first floor is already full. I had found the menu to be interesting and localised western food. Had ordered the burger and found it to be very tasty. The other mains like the ribs looks and tasted good, portion is big.Had enjoyed my meal there
3
We arrived as the first customers, food were delivered promptly. The burgers selection are awesome but the pasta that we ordered tasted differently even though we had the same pesto pasta. It took quite a while to get my hot drink which i had reminded the crews twice. Overall it's a place quick brunch because it's very very hot
4
Pizza was quite nice but the soft shell crabs was on another level! Service staff were friendly and approachable. Typically crowded during peak hour so try to get there by 6pm if you didn't make a reservation. Good place for a casual dinner. No beers available though.
5
Both our burgers were tender and juicy. And the buffalo wings are awesome too.
The staffs were friendly.
We enjoyed our food and definitely worth the price too.
Two thumbs up! üëçüëç
5
As always, the food at i.am is good and worth its value. Only thing was service was a little slower when it gets crowded, esp on the 2nd floor. And it gets a little noisy when there are more ppl. But overall, great.
3
We ordered finger food for an office event, because they are one of the few places that make halal pizza and deliver. The food is OK, but nothing to scream about, in terms of either quality or value.
4
Great halal alternative for quick food. Friendly staff service.
Love the squid black ink past. Goof for family and get to gether with friends
gatherings.
5
Good Halal food joint, you basically get all the western food under one roof. Try their fish and chips and you will like it. Go for their chef recommendations, no regrets
5
Had been there for a couple of times. Their main servings are burgers. Not simply burgers but giant burgers. You would take around 15 minutes to finish it. You might need to wait to be seated. Unique burger experience.
1
Very Poor customer service! My 2 Girlfriends and I reached your cafe last night at 8,45pm and the cafe was not even full. We went in and stood at the counter for a full 5 mins, waiting to be seated. Unfortunately nobody attended to us. The restaurant was not even full. There were a few empty tables and we were only a party of 3! Then some diners got up and walked to the counter to make payment. Only then one of their female staff walked up to the counter and the first thing she did was to ask us to wait outside of the cafe! There was space for us to stand and we were not blocking anyone or hindering any staff from carrying out their duties! We asked her how come we need to go outside and wait when we can wait inside? She replied "oh...see the sign out there? It says Wait to be seated outside"!!! So we went out and left. Service was really good when I AM Cafe first started at Haji Lane. Sadly popularity is causing it to slack in other factors. Will definitely NOT visit this cafe again
1
I had high hopes before tasting their food. Stayed up to google the night before on cafes which serves Halal burgers... This cafe popped up as a popular choice. I really wanted to like your cafe, but the atmosphere was noisy, not ideal for couples who are looking for a quite meal to chat over. Though there were fans to circulate the air, prepare to come out smelling like fried food. Found it inconvenient to walk over to the other side of the shop to pay when it was raining as well. The shop is separated by a road without shelter

I went to I Am yesterday with my wife and was very happy with things, so i'll break my experience down for you. Staff - More polite than most places in Singapore, attentive and professional. Service - Good service, quick food, quick to clear our plates and quickly processed our payments.Setting - An Amsterdam theme, open air restaurant in such a lovely part of Singapore. Bugis and Haji Lane are is so characterful.Food - Very good food, nice fries and substantial burgers and overall very good. As a cook myself, i would say the patty could definitely do with seasoning before it's prepared (lacked that salt and pepper kick)Price - Very much in line with the market for Singapore and the gourmet burgers in the area. I gave it 4 stars just because i felt the meat/patty could have been better seasoned but that is my preference rather than anything else.
4
Food and service were great! Went to break fast with friends on a weekend. Reservation is definitely a must. Staff were great. Only downside is the cutlery provided were insufficient. Staff had to take away plates and forks/knives to wash because they ran out.Food taste awesome except for T-bone steak. The rest are awesome. Will go back definitely
4
Nice place with nice food. After dining, walk along Haji Lane with lots of interesting shops that awaits you. Remember to try their Chai Tea Latte, anytime better than Starbucks & Coffee Bean. Burger is a better choice than pizza here, a must eat.
2
We only ordered a few drinks and some snacks but the service was extremely poor. Completely ignorant and uninterested in helping you.
Perhaps would have given a higher rating if we had tried the food, it did look good on other people's plates.
5
Nice staff, great food. It is not really Dutch food, but the food is great and fresh. Definitly try the Rainbowcake, that one is definitly amazing!
5
Family had great meal - t-bone, boss burger and crayfish pasta. Used the new waitrr app to order & pay... super fast & fresh
5
Celebrated my birthday @ this particular cafe. Food portion is rlly big & halal. About $15per person avg. The bell peppers were exceptional!
4
The staff at i am cafe are friendly, prompt and helpful. The ambience is good and cozy, suitable for a for gatherings.
5
Although there was a crowd the food did not arrive too late and their fish and chips is really delicious! The fish was tender. Downloaded the waitrr app and ordered, paid through the app which was really fuss free and we also managed to get 1-for-1 deals AND $2 off our total bill since it was our first order
5
The staff there are quiet friendly, i've only been there twice and both times are great. Had their burgers which is awesome and messy to eat(in a good way) and also their pasta which is really really good. The price isnt expensive at all, though the drinks are slightly pricey but of course they also provide free plain water if you arent willing to pay for the price of the drinks.
3
Went there for lunch with 2 other friends. The resturant is very warm (probably explain why it's so quiet) with ceiling fans. Service staff is friendly and proactive in giving menus, taking orders and serving. We ordered fish & chips (Chef recommendation), pasta and baked mussels. Baked mussels are with cheese and herbs. The mussels are huge. The cheese and herbs are not very flavourful. The fish and chips served great fish - fresh, with nicely made batter that is not too thick. However the chips are not great. It's dry and soggy in the inside. Until the good chips that are crispy outside and soft in the inside. Somehow the chips felt soggy. The pasta is tasty and done proper. We also ordered a mock tail and ice lemon tea. Reasonable prices and tasty. Nothing too special to talk about. Overall, for the price, I would say it's average food, with great service. Good place for gatherings as it has a great variety on menu- pizza, pasta, burgers etc and it's hala. The place is warm during the day as we are in Singapore, but evening should be rather cooling. Some pics to share
5
We popped in here for some refreshments after touring the area.Really enjoyed the Mocktails and they were good value.We did not eat, but glancing at the tables surrounding us, ( which were all full with diners) the food looked absolutely delicious. Open kitchen so you can see your meals being prepared.We will return to eat at another time
5
The day was hot but my sitting down in I AM cafe was a good experience....from the cool drink to the food to the service staff...I'll be back!
3
Service is not too attentive, maybe because the place is always crowded. Pizza is mediocre, fries are dry but the mayo is good. Fried mushrooms are way too oily. Mocktails are like water plus syrup. We were fully underwhelmed.
4
‚û°Good restaurant...
‚û°Delicious food...
‚û°Yummy taste...
Need to try again next time...üòÉ
üî•Hurry up Hurry up!!!
3
The food were alright but the staff are generally very helpful. Would recommend for the kind and friendly staff over there üëçüèª
5
Great food and ambience. The staff are receptive to feedback and goes to great lengths to create a wonderful dining experience
5
Wow that's all I can say. One of the best burgers I have had in Singapore and it's halal. The service was very friendly and we decided to sit outside even though it was hot but hey I don't get much of a chance to do alfresco dining in London. They do have a room if you prefer being in an air conditioning room.The mocktail was very good and refreshing.I went for the Boss burger which did not let me down. Pure indulgence I would definitely come back again
1
No matter how good your food tastes, we will never know because you turned us away at 955pm when your official hours are 11am to 11pm. Please do the public a favour and amend the hours on your websites and all other blog sites that are listing your establishment as open till 11pmYour shop is also not listed at all on the Directory at My Tampines HubWith the Mall not even placing unit numbers on the front of units, who can find your cafe? It was a nightmare, wasted trip, being turned away, absolutely no service recovery at all. I'd avoid this place
3
Visited after seeing so many good reviews about the space. However, the cafe is not air-conditioned and was extremely humid and warm. To top it off, the kitchen exhaust was directly into the seating area.. Not the best idea. Am not sure why so many others gave such high ratings. Good was averag
5
Haji Lane can offer various options for travelers and locals alike, but I Am is a great place to start. First off, the food is totally worth it. It may come at a touristy price (approx. 30 SGD for two), but the servings and quality is an A+. The service was very accommodating and quick. They offer an option of ordering through an app called Waitrr to get the ball rolling on your orders too. We ordered the turkey bacon burger, margarita pizza, and rainbow cake. My boyfriend was happy because it was the first place he's been to that served turkey bacon with his burger. Perfect for those who avoid pork. The pizza was good too. I think the only thing we wouldn't order again would be the rainbow cake, the slice was huge, but it was a little heavy for us to end the meal. Location wise, it's the first stall along the "pub-ish" street in Haji. It's close by hotels so it's convenient for travelers who need a place to eat right away
3
It has great location. The service is not bad. The atmosphere is quite well. But I found the beverage was a bit too thin, fries wasn't cooked well enough, buffalo wings' taste was not authentic enough and the famous rainbow cake was too heavy. Charcoal grilled beef burger was good.Âú∞ÈªûÂæàÂ•ΩÔºåÊúçÂãô‰∏çÈåØÔºåÊ∞£Ê∞õ‰πüÁÆóÊòØÂæàÊ£íÔºå‰ΩÜÊòØÈ£≤ÊñôÈÉΩÂ§™Ê∑°‰∫ÜÔºåÁÇ∏ËñØÊ¢ùÁöÑÂè£ÊÑü‰∏çÂ§†Â•ΩÔºåÊ∞¥ÁâõÂüéÁÇ∏ÈõûÁøÖÂë≥ÈÅì‰∏çÂ§†ÈÅìÂú∞ÔºåÂ∞èÊúâÂêçÊ∞£ÁöÑÂΩ©ËôπËõãÁ≥ïÂêÉ‰∫ÜÂ§™ËÜ©‰∫ÜÔºåÊàëÊòØË¶∫ÂæóÂè™ÊúâÁâõËÇâÊº¢Â†°ÈÇÑ‰∏çÈåØ

The menu are reasonably priced and food quality is excellent too. Kudos to the team! Tried most of their signature dishes, you will not be disappointed.
3
The food was decent; I really like the juicy burger! However I was taken aback by the night setting in the kitchen, as there were a lot of flies flying about the kitchen light!!
5
We walked past this little "restaurant" on our way from the airport to our hotel and as we had checked in we went back to "I am.." because we were hungry and just gave it a try. We had different burgers and they both were delicious. The staff is also very polite and friendly.
4
We heard about this place and decided to try it. I'm from the Netherlands and love "Bitterballen". So the added reason for excitement was...they had bitterballen on the menu! Place is absolutely buzzing with activity and in spite of many tables occupied, the staff was very friendly. We decided to skip the "great-looking-burgers" and order snacks including the NL-style fries, garlic bread and of course double portion Bitterballen. the fries with DUTCH style mayonnaise, the garlic bread were fantastic, but the bitterballen were absolutely horrible. We both ate one and agreed that we couldn't eat this. The stuffing was tasteless, there was hardly any meat in there and the skin was soft instead of crispy. I opened each and every bitterbal to see if there was meat or something else inside, but could barely find meat. We asked for the check and told the waiter that the 'bitterballen' were horrible and we couldn't eat them. I saw he went to the kitchen so i decided to follow him and speak to the chef. The chef said they use minced meat, but was asking what i was expecting. So i told him that based on the "Dutch" taste, the mix between stuffing and meat should be at least 50/50, don't use minced meat and in addition, make the stuffing taste like something. Went to pay the bill and to my big surprise, both portions were removed from the bill, apologies made AND...the request for the right recipe was the best "save the nite" attempt ever! I offered to pay at east one portion, but they wouldn't have it! Heads off for this service and urge to please customers!We will definitely go back and try the burgers (tthey look awesome) AND we will bring the recipe
4
I was entering the cafe during lunch time; so it was crowded. I only ordered their signature rainbow cake to be taken away. It costed SGD 8.5 for a big slice cake. The cake was still tasted great after 2 days ( I bought it to be taken to Jakarta). Even both of my sons love it
4
Decided to come back when the restaurant we intended to go had a long queue. We don't regret it. The burger was juicy as claimed. Fish and chips was huge and well done. I like that the fries come with the skin. The pizza was only just better than a frozen one
5
Kept walking past was so hungry popped in and a little piece of home I discovered. Being Aussie was missing Aussie food, but got chips garlic bread and a pizza with a can of sars...very reasonably priced friendly efficient and delicious will definately be back... will try a burger next time :
4
food was good. but the waitress was pretty blur when taking the orders.end up we had some friends who received 2 drinks instead. service level has lots of room to improve. will suggest that they have a service bell to attend to the diners at level 2.i love the fries and fish&chips
1
Ordered food at 9pm but did not receive my food way past 10 30pm. The staff made no effort to explain or apologize for the delay even though the traffic at the cafe was minimal. Very poor service
5
The first meal / restaurant I visited once arrived in Singapore. It was walking distance from our hotel. Almost full in the restaurant but not waiting too long to get our seat. Foods and drinks are nice but environment so so. we had dinner but the same time rubbish truck arrived to collect trash and the smell destroyed our mood for dining so we end up not finish the food just take get it take out
4
Was there for lunch - the food was generally food but my pasta portion was rather small for the price I paid!
4
On weekdays, if you want a quieter environment, sit at the main level. As the one on 2nd level can be very noisy when youngsters gather and talk.
4
-Great chicken satay burger seldom seen from other shop
-Juicy marinated chicken patty with great satay source and fresh cut cucumber
-It serve with fries
-My friends burger they ate (The Big Bear beef burger) is huge portion for small eater
4
Food tasted better this time. The rainbow cake is great! Appreciate one of the staff member for throwing a surprise to our friend. Thanks much.
5
It's was an old friend meet up session and we found the food in terms of taste and presentation both were very good. The service staff which was also the cashier was friendly and helpful.
4
good food,value for money,nice ambience never dissapoint.great place to chill or get together with friends and family.
4
If you are looking for halal caf√© around the area, then you should try this. Popular with locals and tourists, central location and near to the hipster Bali Lane. Food quality can be better and more, but we enjoyed the juicy burgers and baked cheesy mussels. Caf√©-style drinks like iced coffee, juices and mocktails.. expected spread but nothing outstanding. Pricing wise, comparable and ok for Singapore F&B standard
4
Went to the new branch at Tampines Hub. Interesting flooring... thought there was a flood with wet newspapers all over the floor... Hahaha.Using Waitrr app was quite interesting. But paying using Paypal is a problem. Then they had to get me read my email to find my order. Maybe teething problems?Food and drinks came in quite fast. I ordered the double trouble burger with an egg. The burger was good but at $20.99, a bit too expensive. A sprinkle of fries which were already cold did not make the meal more interesting. Also, the burger was rather small if you compare the ones at Swensen's. But the burger was nicely cooked and juicy. My wife and son ordered pasta which were average. The mac and cheese was rather painfully bare! $89.00 for a party of 2 adults and 2 kids is quite expensive for a neighbourhood cafe. The rainbow cake we ordered as a takeaway was ok. I am still searching for the best! In short, I have tasted better stuff at a much lower price
4
This cafe was recommended by a friend for their rainbow cake. It was delicious. Though the portion was way too much for one person better to go with company. Average cafe though just on a side street. Didn't try anything else on the menu. It is a good stop over place if you are discovering Arab st and bugis street
4
This place has the best jalape√±o poppers! They were giant, perfectly cooked, spicy, and served with a delicious sauce. I highly recommend this place if you need and American food fix. I had a burger and a fried fish sandwich here too. Both very good. The fries are cooked well too. I also had a Black Forest latte that was delectable. I highly recommend this place.
4
We had lunch at this restaurant this week and the food was very enjoyable. I had squid and my husband had the cheesey balls. The service was quick and we would have no hesitation recommending this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore.
John and Gail Laney
4
Their satay burger standard is still there. First time trying their soft-shell crab burger & it was good. It doesnt have the oily feeling:)
5
Every bite of the hamburger was fantastic and the people working there are really nice. Easy too find next to Arab Street.
5
After a long morning seeing magnificent Singapore sights ,we stooped for a quick lunch and were amazed by the quality of the food and the excellent frindly sevice by the staff.
Greatly recommended
5
Loved it! Burger was amazingly good. Great location. Not too expensive. Red velvet cake to die for. Rainbow cake looked good too!
4
it isnt my first time at IAm but their service was good, food served hot and fast on a weekend. glad that i made a reservation and was given seats upstairs with air condition.
5
Great halal food close to Sultan mosque. It is a small place off Haji lane, may have to wait for open table during rush time. We tried burgers, wings, fish & chips all were delicious. And the specialty drinks were also good.
3
Location is good because the caf√© is right located along the main street & therefore, it is easy to spot.
4
This was a busy little place on the corner that we stopped in for lunch. The food was scrummy and the virgin Mojitos with Lavender and Blueberries were delicious. We would definitely visit again as it was a great place with a good atmosphere and a variety of great food and drinks
5
it is located on the intersection of north bridge and haji lane. it's quite a small cafe but quite fancy.. the most important thing it's halal. we tried the pasta, burger and fries with cheese dip.. overall everything is good, but the most yummy is the cheese dip. So goooood...
5
Mad love for their soft shell crabs. Acceptable waiting time for a table of 8. Noone left disappointed!
4
We just passed by and were attracted by the smell of the food. We had some fish and chips, also some hamburgers. Well, quite good. Enjoy a cozy afternoon.
4
This is is small cafe tucked at the corner of te street with awesome food and gr8 vibe...must try past..sloshed.beef burger with juicy patty...and rainbow cake which is yumm
4
My sincere thanks for allowing us to bring our own birthday cake for my fiance√®'s birthday. We had an amazing time. The restaurant had a rustic vibe to it. The food was absolutely spectacular.What a great place!
5
nice open air spot right at the edge of the arab section of town, a block from the mosque. friendly service, wide range of athentic items on the menue, home made desserts.
4
Above average food but the ambience made up for it. We paid service charge but had to pack iur own leftovers.
5
A bit crowded but service was fast and the food was delicious and reasonable price... they even have a kids menu not your usual nuggets but delicious kid size portions. For a busy night service was fast.
4
satisfied.A nice burger joint. Had their signature 'Big Bear' burger for lunch. Delicious, juicy. Would've liked the egg slightly less cooked but that's only a slight niggle. They missed our order ofa Cheezy Bomb starter but we weren't fused because the burgers were enough for us. I Am ... satisfied
5
Arrived during lunch and was given good service. Too bad i didnt get his name. He was very patient and recommended the popular dishes to us in each category: burgers, sides, drinks, pasta flavours. Thought the cajun chicken was quite tough but overall, its super filling. I didnt manage to finish my fries!
3
It's a halal cafe, so it's good for me. Then again, this area has quite a number of halal restaurants to choose from. The place is open, close to the road. I'd recommend this for catching up with friends, but not when you have tiny active toddlers who want to run around and explore the surroundings.
4
My last trip to Singapore is designed as a vegan trip. Glad they have a very good taste of vegan pizza. So for sure I left the place with a happy tummy. No guilty feeling after eating the delicious food.
5
High recommended place to eat(: customer service was great, food was delicious & price is equal to the quality of the food. .............................................................................................................................................................................................
5
One of the finest little eateries I've come across recently! Boasting a simplistic bill of fare certainly was refreshing to come across!
Our dishes were contemporary and had that oh so delightful home cooked flavour, all in all superb!
4
Food was greasy but value for money. We had fish and chips, burgers, mac n cheese and crayfish pasta. The crayfish pasta was slightly fishy.
Service was halting. Some servers are cold and refused to smile. Some were friendly.
Still worth a visit!
3
Came here as my partner was curious that this place was quite talked about within the malay community. Ordered their special of the day - tbone steak and a side order of jalapenos. The jalapenos cooked with mozzarella cheese came in a huge sizes (about the size of an average palm). Although it didn't really seem presentable, the overall taste was pleasant but we couldn't finish it as we were expecting bite-sized portions (it was listed under starters). When ordering the steak, I guess it was partially my fault that I did not indicate my preference of doneness. And the waitress could have checked with me instead of assuming it to be well-done.... WELL-DONE! LOL. I personally hate it when steak is cooked well-doned. But I'm sure the steak would have been nice if it was medium or medium-rare. Overall, I would definitely come back if there wasn't a queue to try their burgers (seems like everyone was ordering that). But I feel it's not worth queuing for. Atmosphere and service was really good though, only the food ruined my experience for that visit
4
We had a nice lunch after walking quite some hours.It's a friendly staff and nice food.You feel a bit in Holland because they have bitterballen on the menu( a typical Dutch snack. There are also a lot of Dutch street name plates on the wall. So make sure you don't miss i
3
We ordered the a burger with egg, shrimp burger and fries.The beef burger has good taste but I have had better.The shrimp burger was nice but not great.The fries was DRY! Their fish and chips looked very nice. Service was good at one point when it started getting busy it was hard to get the staff attention.The place was good but in Singapore there's definitely better
4
Went with my friends and we ordered their fish and chips, some pastas and salmon pizza, fries and rainbow crepe with choco sause. Friees were tasty as fresh potatoes were used and nicely cooked. Salmon pizza and fish and chips were great too.Service could be better as we were not issued utensils when the crepe was served.

The service staff went to check on our reservation but never came back only to be told by another staff after we asked a second time that they couldn't find our reservation which I did using Chope. Even after we were seated, the service was slow and staff impatient.

If you're visiting Singapore, don't miss out on an I Am burger. So happy that I found this place so early into my stay in Singapore. Located off the very hip Haji Lane, I Am is an open-air restaurant serving up great burgers and drinks.We have so many good halal gourmet burger joints in the UK, but nothing as good as I Am's burgers. For once I was eating a burger packed with flavour - not just a plain beef patty doused in toppings and sauces. I tend to get fed up of burgers half way through (I'm not a fan of plain-tasting ones) but not at I Am, I managed to polish off every single bite!We visited this place 3 times during a short stay in Singapore, and both my husband and I were so impressed. Their mocktails are great too - the best we've ever had. The signature Bushra Mint is a must-try!Negative points - The chips served alongside the burgers are a bit of a let-down, tasteless and not a very pleasant texture. The Pizza didn't look too appetizing (so don't waste a trip to I Am on a Pizza!), and finally, the staff - not that they were rude, but they definitely weren't friendly or welcoming either which is a shame for a place that serves up great food! I hear they also have a indoor dining area above the restaurant, so if the idea of melting in the Singapore heat for food doesn't appeal to you, you can sit upstairs

Very worth it with 1 for 1 burger with OCBC card although only limited to one type of burger. Buffalo wings were not very spicy and easy to eat.
5
The food is really worth the price cause it's so damn good and filling!! Their red velvet cake is my utmost favourite cake!!! Their cream cheese is so fresh and the cake is light and fluffy. Everything is awesome!!
4
The burgers and jalepeno poppers were yummy, however the fries, although they looked good, were cold and tasteless. Large cocktail and mocktail list. Good meal overall.
5
Very pleasant cafe. I had the berry tea. We shared a BLT which was excellent. There is an alley next to the cafe with very cool fashion and things
4
Dinner here is fun with friends! Usually long queue..so you can tell how the food quality should be good. We ordered variety of foods. I got the signature main The Boss charcoal burger which is tall! Matcha latte is good too but I guess it comes from powder. Friends ordered things like fish and chips, fish burger, beef sandwich , pasta, please judge it from the photos :
5
One of my favourite places and a must do each time I visit Singapore, the very burgers I've ever had (I'm sure the rest of the menu is amazing but I just keep getting the burgers!)The coolest location (Next to the wonderful Haji Lane), wonderful staff and a very chilled out vibe
5
I eat burgers, a lot of them and most of the time they are usually the same, but having this burger was something else. I ordered the "big boss" which has an onion ring and an egg in the burger on top of the 7-herb infused beef patty. The burger arrived and towered over the chips it came with (which I think could do with an upgrade). I tried to flatten it which caused the egg yolk to drip out the sides, I knew it was going to get messy and it did. The beef patty really was something else, it wasn't your ordinary minced beef. The herbs were coming out with every bite and really gave the burger a memorable taste. I highly recommend dining at this place their mocktails were also really nice and it is a great halal option
5
Good menu, my brother and I both had the satay chicken burgers and hands down one of the best burgers we've had, everyone enjoyed their meal! Good location , we were able to take a stroll down Arab St afterwards. Good service as well, would recommend great halal option in Singapor
4
This is a cute spot to grab some lunch. They have a wide variety of food, from burgers, to pizza, to pasta, etc. I got the pesto Chicken penne and it was pretty good except they put way too much salt on it. In summary: Good spot to grab some lunch
3
Located in the corner of Haji Lane, open air, very casual, serves Halal food - burgers, pizza, sandwiches etc.. Food is good enough and service was ok. I went with a group of friends, we were happy to catch up with each other so we didn't mind the place. Having said that, they were very busy even on a weekday. So they must be doing something right. And you can just step out to the roadside for a cigarette anytime!! And they do not accept reservation
4
Great food and not pricey, there's a huge selection too (but it lacks many of the real Amsterdam food). The ambience al fresco is nice as well but can be a bit hot during the day.
4
Serving good burgers and pastas as well as light bites, this is a causal but hip place for great food at great prices, if one does not mind the lack of air conditioning.
5
2nd visit with my Hubby.
Been here 5 times, every time the foods which were being served never disappoint me.
It is a must visit place.
Ordered:
Iced Nutella choc
Buskinmint
Soft shell crab burger
Seafood Alio Oligo
Baked mussels
4
Late evening coffee with a friend; had the crepe cake on recommendation from Yus - he was right about everything!
Worth coming back!
5
What a great find tucked away in the back streets of arab district singapore not a big place first day was packed came back second day had awesome lunch and cakessasss to die for
4
Had been wanting to patron the cafe for the longest time but was always put off by the crowd. Fortunately I was able to get a table before the crowd arrived. First, the iced Nutella chocolate was not overly sweet and I love the subtle Nutella sweet in the chocolate milk. I had ordered Charcoal grilled Sloppy beef burger. The little sauce did not give the name justice. The beef patty was very flavourful thought. Lastly we had ordered the popular rainbow to share. It was very very yummy but unfortunately our tummies were too full to accommodate more food. All in all, the entire dining experience was great. I just hope that there's a stool or something which let my bag 'sit'... :)
4
I've tried many of the places on Haji lane and most are not worth a second visit. I am... Is well worth a second visit. Great burgers, not to flashy but amazing taste. Good services and deserts make this my new local go to when I feel the need for a burger
3
After spending a week in Singapore we really missed a nice burger. So, we thought to visit "I am".I must admit that their "Charcoal Grilled 'Big Bear' Beef Burger" was seriously good. It was well cooked and juicy. My only recommendation is to add fans since "I am" doesn't have indoor space and sitting outdoor in Singapore's hot and humid weather is quite challenging
4
Went with friends....My first time...and I really loved everything each one of us ordered. No Frills... Simple menu and delectable food... My Buddies thought the same!!The Roast beed Sandwich was brilliant....and the bread was freshly made .The pesto pasta and Fish and chips are a must try.Attentive staff and really good service.I'd really like to go back
4
We stumbled upon 'I AM' on a Saturday morning. Why was a tiny corner shop that looked like a 'hawker stand' absolutely jammered?! Soooo glad we checked it out! AMAZING food and QUICK & COURTEOUS service! The prices were a little 'rich' for the area, but hey...its SGP! Still glad we stopped & we will definitely go back! Great to know they are OPEN during CNY, when so many others are closed
5
Pretty colours and nice flavoured... Not too sweet,just nice... Easy to find and friendly staffs too....
5
Every thing taste so delicious i love each and every thing and reasonable price , I highly recommend it small restaurant but must try
2
Ordered a crepe cake and cafe latte. Cafe latte was okay but the dessert was horrible. Extra dense layers with chocolate which only tasted of flour.
5
Good food, great portions and more importantly great service. Coffee was also very good. You cant leave this place without trying the "best rainbow cake" in the world. surely a food selfie cake.
3
Nice place for lunch but be prepared to wait as it is crowded. Service is quick but time for food takes a long time - so don't expect a quick lunch. Crayfish spaghetti is good because of the spice.
3
Second visit here. This time, we only had the rainbow cake which was huge. But the taste was just average. Too much coloring I guess. Anyway, prefer their burger which tasted really good during my last visit. Very busy but service was prompt and very friendly too
4
We went for early dinner and the service was quick and very friendly. I got the pasta with chicken and it tasted great. The waiter brought my sons food first, which was nice as he was hungry and was not in the mood for waiting.I liked that the ice tea was homemade and that it came with sugar on the side, to adjust the sweetness as wanted
4
This restaurant always serves good quality burgers which are Halal. A variety of other dishes are available but the burgers are just the kings here. On weekends, the street they are on is closed so they have tables out in the street which is very breezy and nice. Staff always very nice. Downside: The crepe cake is dry and not very good. The mocktail drinks are a bit toooo sweet. The rainbow cake is very good, but massive so must share with others
4
Went on a Thursday night, it was super busy and had to wait around 25 mins to get a table. Casual atmosphere, seating was extended into the laneway which was closed to traffic in the evening. No aircon so better to dress down especially during hot days..
3
I stopped here as I was walking by after I saw their pretty dessert case. I ate a piece of the rainbow crepe cake, an interesting idea, and it tasted decent. I also ordered this European meatball appetizer and did not enjoy it - the meatball was fried on the outside and the inside was uncooked and liquidy. I was told it was supposed to be liquidy like that, it was not undercooked, but it did not taste right to me. Overall, I'd say it's worth stopping for dessert
4
Ordered a seafood pizza and shared it with my friend. Reasonable price and i love that the prawns are big and juicy. Located at Haji Lane
4
Nice decent Halal restaurant. Do take note that it is mostly crowded so you will be better off dressing lightly. Pretty decent food and a good place for you to either recharge or fuel up before going down Haji Lane.
3
Service could be more warmth and livelier. The food was good in presentation.. but tasted average.
The drinks however, was good.
I would visit again to try something else *hoping it taste much better*
5
The burgers are awesome and its reasonably priced, so its a good family dinner out. We just visited last night- Sunday, no need to wait, as you cant book or reserve, hence i think we will be going on sundays from now on!
5
Stumbled in looking for nourishment. Ordered phenomenal pinapple burgers, so juicy on the inside and charred on the outside, never liked pineapple on a burger but this made me into a believer. We ordered an appetizer platter, chicken wings were the best, soft shell crab great, but the calmer we found over battered and the grilled shrimp and mussels would have been better off without the rich creamy 'pasta alfredo' like sauce on them. We would come back here in a heartbeat for the burgers and wings
5
Initially we were intending on having dinner there but we ended up in another establishment with less of a crowd waiting to be seated. We ended up there after dinner for dessert, but no matter as the rainbow cake blew me away.The cafe has an open-air concept, not ideal in our humid weather, in my opinion. That did not stop the crowd though, for it was full. Given the capacity crowd, I noticed the service crew did well and did not seem the least bit frazzled. They turned tables over for the next customer with speed. Back to dessert and that famous rainbow cake! It presented itself in a huge slab with multiple bright colours surrounded by fresh white cream. It definitely enticed me to take a bite off it as soon as it was served. Multi-hued and extremely tasty but yet not too sweet, it was an perfect ending to our dinner date
3
We stumbled across this place as we were wandering around near haji lane ... And thank heavens we did..... Nothing like a burger and Coke to give you the protein and sugars you need for a serious sightseeing. The burgers were delicious with soft flavoursome patties and good chips. Service was fast and with a smile. Burgers were around $17 each which is pretty normal for a dine in burger. Would recommend for burger lovers
4
This place is located at the corner of arab street and has great food and drinks. We ordered the pizza and burger which was very nicely done. The taste was good. Although the place is small the food quality is great and the portion was perfect
3
I've been hearing about this place fro my friend and saw it a couple of times. The rainbow cake was really attractive. I went here lastweek and ordered the rainbow cake and lime juice. (There's a free water anyway)I think the cake is so buttery. I only a bit of it and gave asked my friend to finish it. hehe I think it was too much for me to take for 1 seating. The location of the store is nice. you can walk to the Haji lane after or visit the Mosque and take photos of the graffitis around the area.I could go back and try their famous burgers but enough with the cakes. heh
4
I had the juicy burger (one of their signature dishes - first one mentioned under Burgers), which has pineapple on top. It was so flavorful and delicious. The ketchup/tomato sauce for the French fries also has a kick to it, which was unexpected but delicious. Only downside is you have to get up and walk to a cooler for water and they only have small glasses. It's not even 6pm and the place is packed
4
Great burger, buzzling place, and really good service - sometimes that is all you need and you get it here!
4
Excellent cafe serving western food next to Arab Street. Was busy but service quick and attentive. Nicely or prepared and presented dishes which were tasty. Prices reasonable. When we were there we downloaded the Poket ap and got a free drink.
4
Loved their and the atmosphere...it's always busy and you have to queue up but it's certainly worth it!! I had the clarify shell crab and their classic burger...amazing!! I'm going back for more with the family...a gem in Haji Lane üòç
2
After hearing of this cafe multiple times, i decided to give it a shot. It was below expectations...Oily fish greasy burger overcooked fries. Got my drinks 5 minutes after all my food came. Over priced as well for a cafe. Costed us 80 bucks for 2, 2 appetisers 2 main and a cake. What a let down.
3
Only tried the rainbow cake and an iced mocha. Rainbow cake was huge and vibrantly coloured, definitely great for pictures and wow-ing over. Taste-wise, not spectacular. Couldn't taste any difference in the colors, so probably just colouring? Unlike some other rainbow cakes in other cafes where you can actually taste the different flavours.Cafe was a little too warm for a mid-afternoon. Fortunately cooled down by the iced mocha. No reason for me to return again
4
You wont miss this restaurant because its in the corner of Haji Lane towards Arab street. The ambiance is just nice as the wind is blowing while you eat. The space is quite small, i think it can accommodate around 40-50 pax, in and out the restaurant. The waiters are attentive enough. Food serving is average about 15-20 minutes.
4
was walking thru haji lane when my husband and i spotted a busy little corner cafe that was full of locals. we decided to give it a try-great halal - western options. tried the cajun chicken burger and honey glazed chicken with the fries-buns were soft and chicken was good. they had the best chilli sauce!!! price was ok, overall-we enjoyed. cons: we sat in the overflow area without a fan so it got a bit hot sometimes but it was alright. price range: each entree about $15sg
4
This place served great burgers, homemade burgers buns that are soft & nice. The burger comes with a chargrill flavour. Fish & chips are battered and love the chips, thicker & longer. Pasta was tasty and al-dente. We tried the velvet cake, far to big piece and moderate taste & texture. The place is slightly small, not much of the air condition that was felt as they had an open kitchen. Overall a good experience on the food and will definitely return again for burgers or around thr corner.
3
stopped by this small cafe as it was packed, the location is arab street so theres plenty of things to do around there. the coffee was not bad, a little weak by eurpoean standards. but it was alright. a nespresso machine perhaps? the cake was nice too, it being a huge piece.The only issue was the comfort level, it was incredible hot and humid that day, and the staff did nothing to assist with our comfort level.its a cheap and cheerful cafe, so overall, still good wor
3
There always seemed to be a Que outside this place anytime i walked past so i assumed it must be something special, its not. Its just about average and far from the best burger i have had. I asked for mine to be cooked medium rare, which they said was not a problem, however it arrived well done. It had taken so long to arrive i couldn't be bothered to complain. Even if it had been cooked as requested it would still have been pretty average. Seriously i don't quite know what all the fuss is about as this place is just average
4
We were recommended to I Am by a Haji Lane merchant and were very satisfied. The food is delicious and in very laege portion! The drinks, the main meal and deserts are very nice. Don't forget the rainbow cake!
4
Food was great. We came for early dinner at 5 pm on Sunday and the place was already crowded. Service was fast though. The staffs were attentive and friendly. We love their signature dessert, the rainbow cake. Price reasonable. We will return.
5
Very chilled out place where everyone can hang,eat and enjoy. Expect a long queue especially on weekend evenings. The service is really good! Nice,friendly and helpful staff. Pizza,drinks and especially the cakes are all budget friendly and yummy!! Will definitely come again and again and again! Haha a very must see and eat place when you travel to Singapore. Good job I am...team! Cheers!

After reading the TA reviews, we visited I am..... for lunch last week. I had the Fish & Chips which were good, but not amazing, the fish had a very heavy thick batter on it and the fish was quite tasteless other than the taste imparted by the possibly old or burnt oil it was cooked in. The chips were great - rustic cut and crispy (just how I like them) My wife had a B.L.T - which also wasn't exactly to her liking, the "bacon" was turkey bacon (which the menu advised) but was not fried/crispy, but more like many slithers of salami..... again, others may not find fault in this, but our expectations were different. The milkshake I had was great, cool, thick and refreshing. I am..... was busy, every single time we walked past. There is even chairs lined up for people waiting to get a table. We will visit again, as there were many other menu options that appealed to us, sadly on this occasion, we weren't blown away, simply by the choices we made that just weren't what we were expecting
3
Walked past this place a few times and the cake window caught my eye. Menu is mostly Western options about $15SGD a dish. We ordered the pizza and a pasta and it was pretty good. Since we were so full we got a slice of the rainbow cake takeaway $9SGD and it was so big we had it for dessert and breakfast the next day! Decent eats, simple open decor
4
Always love the food here. However there is always a crowd. So you have to join the queue before being seated. It used to be a standing queue but they have provided chairs & menus now! So use your time queuing to decide on your food cause I realized how quick they will come & get your order once you're seated.Pretty extensive menu. Different type of burgers (chicken/beef), even vegan ones & pizzas. They have a few hotdog menu & pasta though. I believed it's muslim-owned (or they already halal-certified maybe) so its a fully halal establishment. Don't forget to try out the drinks - so many quirky drinks to choose from! One thing that is really good about I am is the location, its so easy to find as its by the road & they even expanded to have a couple more smaller cafes in that vicinity. So try it if you want nice halal cArbo loading meal! You will not be disappointed!
3
Small interesting cafe..heard alit of hype about this joint..tried it with wife..i had sloppy burger while wife had fish n chips..ordered hot wings on the side..Sloppy burger were well presented but cant bite the taste compare to other cafe i been through but still not that bad..Fish n chips was not bad..nice..Wings was abit salty..could taste the high amount of msg..I had to agree though...rainbow cake is indeed 1 of the best i tried..moist..full of flavour and goes well with coffeeWould i return..? Only for the cake...definitely.
4
Really good burgers. Tasty, well seasoned, good quality meats and a nice choice of options. Had the one with pineapple and was very happy with my selection. Best burger I have had in Asia. Service was friendly , food came quickly and was a reasonable price (western standards). Chips were ok. Be careful of the chilli ketchup if you don't like spice.
4
Visited this joint on a weekday with my wife. Nice non airconditioned place with a quirky deco. Polite staff and most important of all, good food at a reasonable price. My wife and me enjoyed our cajun burger and cajun chicken aglio olio pasta respectively. The drinks are quite refreshing as well and highly recommended for a hot day.
4
We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here. We arrived early which was probably the only way to get a table here! Polite waitress but it would have been great if she was more knowledgeable about food allergens as she looked a bit puzzled when we asked her if the food contains dairy. She did however inquire from the kitchen and get back to us promptly! The food was yummy and value for the amount charged!
3
On the menu most items are not "Dutch": did you not try the pannenkoeken, stammpot, poffertjes when you were in Amsterdam?
But as a "normal" cafe, the service is very good. That is why you are popular.
5
They have an add outside of their venue that says they dont care about what background people come from, the only care about individuals, the hire people that share their philosophy and that's awesome!
I loved their rainbow cake and the minty mocha!!
4
very nice cafe but yes it's always packed.. food was great but have yet to try their desserts. would definitely come back again
3
I very disappointed with the service n its very hot place some more.. the drink taste blantly...n food not given small plate for the pizza ...food wise just average.
5
Amazing little place severing up Dutch/Western dishes. It was packed with locals so we stopped to try it out. We had the huge fish and chips and the best burger we have had in Singapore the "The juicy"
5
This place was bustling with people on Sunday night and so we decided to stop by.We ordered a grilled chicken burger and a BLT sandwich. The sandwich was so good that I can come back just for that! Drinks were good too.Seating and service were fine. Good portion sizes and not expensive either
4
This cafe is always packed and has long queues. I happen to chance upon it at 9.45pm and thankfully kitchen closes 10pm and restaurant closes at 11pm. The portions are big and the food is worth the price. Cheesy bombs were awesome and the jumbo hotdogs may get a bit messy but its delicious. Would come back if the queue wasnt long
4
Burger was really good, especially the patty.Service was very nice and service minded in General.Portions could be bigger. Im not a big eater and the portion was good for me, but a big eater wont me stuffed after he ate a burger (comes with fries)
4
Visited I am a couple of times whilst staying in Singapore. It wasn't far from our hotel. Food was exceptional, service very friendly. Fish and chips and burgers were great. Very busy little spot, you may have to wait for a table, but the food is worth waiting fo
5
My sister brought us to this place which she frequents. I ordered ham and cheese sandwich and was surprised by the big serving and it wasn't just ham and cheese... It was ham and cheese and lettuce and tomatoes. I was happy. My mom had their seafood pasta which she said was one of the best she has tasted and they did not scrimp on ingredients. My sister's fiance had a burger which he could hardly finish. The burger looked small but he said it was very filling. I agree after seeing the thick cut of burger patty. We also had the rainbow cake for dessert. It was not too sweet.. The cream cheese frosting was good. I am unaware of the prices as my sister was the one who foot the bill but I don't reckon she would frequent the place if it was overpriced. I would gladly return and take the tab next time
4
We ate here on more than one occasion good value for money. The burgers were a treat and prices were reaso
4
Nice little place to stop for lunch. Burgers are good and the staff are friendly. It's next to a couple of good shopping streets and is a good place to stop for a recharge
4
the queue took very long mainly because this place seems to be very hip right now. It took us almost 2 hours to get our seats. The burger was very delicious! it's worth the wait.
4
I have passed this place more times than I can remember and never stopped, mianly due to the fact that in their glass counter resides those horrendous multi coloured layered cakes that usually signifies a bad restaurant in Singapore.This time though after seeing their advert on a column about 20metres before the restaurant I thought there was something I hadn't spotted before. Previously when I had passed by it has always been fairly busy and this time instead of grabbing a cab home I thought I'd stop. I am glad I did.I ordered a classic burger for take away which came with fries with the skins left on and inside the burger a large onion ring. Not the ones that are too crunchy, this one was just right. The flavour of the sauces were pretty good, but maybe one thing was that it was slightly overdone ... which I don't mind compared to asking for medium at other places and getting a slab of barely cooked meat.I think I will be back to this place ... and in short don't judge a book by its cover
5
My friend and I had lunch at I am.. a couple of weeks ago. Between us, we ordered fries (that came with one dip) and you can add $1 for an additional dip (ranges from honey mustard to cheese). We chose the honey mustard, but felt like it was not worth that price. We also ordered jalapeno poppers (jalepeno stuffed with cheese). AWESOME! There were about 5-6 pieces (and because the peppers were so hugeeee.. we couldn't finish it all). For our mains, my friend ordered the Cajun Chicken Aglio Oglio Pasta and I had the Cajun Chicken Burger. Portion sizes were amazing. I had a choice of salad/fries to go with mine. Chicken in the pasta were cut up breast meat (my favourite)! All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch and cannot wait to go back!Pros:Offers free-of-charge waterAwesome vibeAwesome big slices of their cakes (red velvet, rainbow, and oreo cheesecake). Make sure you have one! Wide selection of starters, mains and mocktails/milkshakes Great service! (The klutz that we were -- we spilled over some water and the girl who was serving us was nothing short of making sure we did not feel like fools). So two thumbs up for that! Cons:If you reach during peak hours, be prepared to wait to be seated (and this may sometimes be under the hot scorching Singapore sun). I say -- it's worth the wait though
5
I was going to Singapore with a friend who requires Halal food and we found I Am... on the internet. We went there to have some burgers or sandwiches and we thought it would be just regular fast food but we were so wrong. The store is very easy to find, it's close to Masjid Sultan. The burgers and hotdogs are super delicious and you can hardly find cooking oil left on your fries. For hotdog lovers, I recommend the messy type of hotdog menu.On lunch, it's usually very full. We went there on Saturday and it was open for order starting 11.30AM
5
Went there for a birthday dinner with the family. Not my first time but first time for others in my family.We find the food quality is excellent. Price is great. Location is great. Wish the restaurant would expand someday. On some days, there would be long queues. Would go there again soon. Family enjoyed the food there
5
First time at the restaurant, I did not what to eat and the staff recommended one the special burger. And when the food came I was not disappointed at all. The burger is delicious and portion is just nice for me. Highly recommended for the pasta and other food in the menu. Overall I am satisfied and happy
3
A place you can have hamburger or pizza, fish'n'chips... with nice ambience of semi-open air. I had their signature "big bear" hamburger, the meat is good while I prefer firmer bun. Size was not as big as I expected from its name and price. Overall OK place to enjoy good food and atmosphere
4
I AM is a nice place to hangout as they offer some great food. Their drinks are at par with the food and the ambiance is lively as well. One should look forward to try out their cakes too. The price may appear a bit more but the overall experience is worth. Service is nice and staff is warm and friendly.Had been there twice and planning to visit again soon. Strongly recommend others to try it out
4
Fall in love with their food to the ambience, smack in the street of great history. A nice place to just chill with a bunch of mates and watch the daily trendsetters passes by.
2
Have had better pizzas from Iceland, drinks were also warm which was odd. Prices weren't awful but if you're gonna go order the burgers
4
Loved the decor and quaint street location. Loved the cake, but as it is baked fresh, sometimes they ran out of the favourites.
5
The food in menu is fantastic. I like the fish & chips/soft shell crab & the crepes most.
The staff are attentive and pleasant.
Location is great, but the space is a little sqeezy though...
5
Amazing cafe on Arab street highly recommend this place it was busy when we went obviously a popular place. We ordered the Cajun chicken burger it was delicious very well presented we also ordered a mocktail and fresh orange juice both were just divine and very refreshing. We went here on our last day in Singapore if I had more days I would liked to have tried a few other things on the menu everything just looked delicious the staff were great too very good service. This place is a MUST if visiting Singapore a little gem in Arab street for sure 
4
I heard and read so many good reviews about I Am Cafe which located at Haji Lane. It wasn't open on Monday and I will leave Singapore on Tuesday. Thus, I quickly grab the chance to visit them on Tuesday before I'm off to Changi Airport. Since I am alone, I could only a drinks and dessert. I ordered Ice Latte (the weather was so humid and hot) and a piece of colourful rainbow crepes. The rainbow crepes taste really yummy!!!!! That is one of the best crepe I ever had. But the portion was quite big and I couldn't finish everything. The coffee was really good too. MUST Visit them if you're in Singapore. Not to be missed ya! :
4
My husband had the Big Bear beef burger and I the fish and chips. For drinks, I drank the Bushramint and my husband had the Root Beer. With the exception of the root beer, everything else is the chef's speciality.The big bear beef burger patty was juicy, cooked to perfection. The spicy sauce that accompanies the dish was really really good. It smacks you with the right amount of heat. The fish and chips was nice and flaky. My only issue was that it was a tad greasy and the batter was not fully cooked through and I was hoping for the same spicy sauce but it's fish and chips so all i got was mayo. The one thing that I really appreciate most is that drinks were paired with fruits such as cherries for root beer and the concoction that is the "Bushramint". It was beautiful, citrusy and minty at the same time. Worked well as a palate cleanser and washes out the greasy stuff that I ate. Ambience was great but some seats are by the road side. Where I sat is a 2-seater table nearer to the road and the counter, of which the table was a little wonky. I did not ask for a change though cos it was a perfect spot. The service was good although I do recall a waiter who never smiles. Everyone else was great and friendly
4
Stubbled on this place in the Arab quarter late afternoon. Menu typical of western none franchise burger joints. Both the beef and chicken burgers were excellent would come again, worth paying more than the usual for this type of cafe/ restaurant. Service was friendly and efficient.
4
We were at Haji Lane and decided to have our lunch at the I am cafe. The cafe was crowded but we didn't wait long for a seat. We ordered 2 pizzas and a I am platter together with 4 drinks. That costs us about $60, a price that was quite reasonable for 4 of us. The service was fast and satisfactory. My mother, who didn't really like western food, was happy with our orders. She thought the food was tasty and nice. To me, the food was not particularly special but the atmosphere at the cafe was relaxing and leisurely and that made the whole experience satisfactory

For someone passing by the restaurant might not consider dining here since its a small restaurant with very basic seating style. However, what the place lacks in looks it sure beats it with its food. To define the taste in words is simply not possible for me. I had the vegetarian burger and it was nothing short of eating in any of the fine burger joints. It was fresh and full of taste. The vegetarian pizza was so yummy and fresh and the dough for the pizza base was freshly made. Its a good place and surely a value for money

Went there as it was most recommended in trip advisor. Been there during a weekend night about 7 pm. We tried the charcoal bread burger which was juicy, meatball's pizza, and meatball's pasta. Overall, food was good as expected. Perhaps having more choices in the menu would added more advantages and choices to customers.Customer service was also great. Keep it up. We were quickly attended to since we had a small child with us. We don't mid visiting again next time when we are around Singapore

Decent western food with a twist of Asia and some innovations in e.g. the burger fillings. Decent and large sandwiches with good Ciabatta bread and not the "usual" sandwich bread Expect (good) turkey ham though, not porkIt can be crowded there. Interior is nice but you have have to sit on the street which is also nice (pedestrian street). Good and nice servic

We went here on the recommendation of our friends so we decided to give it a go since it was near our hotel. Went here on our final night in Singapore and all the tables were full so we waited. It was our first time waiting for a table so it was both a new experience to wait and dine at I Am. We ordered while waiting so when we were finally seated, our food came in a jiffy. The waiters and waitresses were so nice and we loved the whole hipster style they had on! definitely something different. The food is a little pricey but definitely a good value for money. Total recommendation

Cheezy bombs was very tasty! Ordered sausage love pizza and nothing special with the pizza, will try burger or pasta later on. The cafe was small and crowded, but the service was great. It was raining when I arrived there, and the place was a bit not comfortable when rains.

Located in Arab street, this cafe always have a long queue, but fortunately the queue is fast. They serve mainly western food with nice cakes and drinks. Western food like aglio oglio spaghetti and hawaiian thin crust pizza is delicious. There is no air conditioning at the cafe. We had the rainbow cake. It is very big in portion and can be share between 3 persons
5
On a visit to the Arab quarter the "I Am "cafe is a must stop visit. Situate on the corner of the trendy boutique shops of Hji Lane, its a gresty place to relax, take in the buzz of passers by and the streetlife. Food is mainly western and the cakes are to die for, both in design and portion size. We also tried the yummy lemon and honey tea

Expect ques however, the food is worth the wait. The restaurant is open air and quite small. A little expensive however the serving size is generous. We asked the waiter for food recommendations. Food is yummy! It's in Haji Lane, a quick walk to the haven for shopaholics. I love the cheese balls which are spicy

Like:THE SERVICE. I couldn't give them more credit :)The appetizer: please do order Jalapeno Poppers - it's that good!Drinks are refreshing - I had virgin mojito, a bit sweet to my liking but still good!The ambience.And of course, the location!OKThe pasta - I think it's fine.DislikeSuper oily fish for fish and chips. Perhaps something to be improved next time
3
We ordered the fish and chips as we fancied something English/European ;-) and they were advertizing home made dutch fries... which turned out to be from a freezer bag as far as we could tell... bleh! :-(The fish was extremely good though... and the iced coffees were fine... Service was really quite awful... Overall it was an average experience and probably not worth going out of your way for..

Cafe is small, and quite crammed up, not very comfortable. It's open, so can be quite hot. We ordered Chicken Cajun which tasted good. Staff was very friendly and helpful.

It was my first time trying out something at this cafe. Heard a few rave reviews and some average ones. It's usually too packed with a very long line for me to bother trying but I went on a Sunday morning around 1130am and the cafe was just starting to receive customers. The place is small but the ambience is generally okay. I had a Big Bear burger or something. It was a huge burger for me and very filling with lots of fries. I also tried a chocolate oreo drink and it was delightful as well. They are priced around the same range as other cafes but I think the food is mostly worth it. We paid around $43 for two mains and 2 drinks. The location is also convenient when it's not so full - short walk from Bugis MRT in front of Golden Landmark Shopping Centre

Busy little caf√©, not much seating but they do their best to get you in quickly they do have curb side dining so your not necessarily sitting in the restaurant but just around the lane way. Service was quick we ordered while we waited and by the time we got a seat our meals came really quickly. Very tasty and a generous serve can get a good feed with a drink for around $20

I ordered the 'famous' sloppy burger which costs around $14 bucks, reasonable for cafes and restaurants alike. However, I was disappointed when I tried the burger. the description on the menu clearly says that the burger is topped with a good amount of cheese but when I got it, the cheese was non-existent. only some tangy tomato based sauce was in it which I found very distasteful, especially in burgers. On to the important part, the burger patty was tough, overcooked and hard to chew. The burger patty has a satay-like taste and texture (think about chewing satay meat left out in the open for a long time) I do not recommend any of their burgers there.However, their service quality was commendable. Menu selection and payment was smooth, I am giving an extra star just for this.

We were casually walking in Haji lane and it started pouring with rain so we decided to stop and have something to eat at 'I am'.The staff were very friendly and we were seated outside with our pram and 3 kids.We decided to have the signature dish which is the burger. Service was quick and efficient. Our meal was absolutely delicious and we had one of the best-tasting burgers ever! The waiter explained that the beef pattis are home-made and the bread. Wow. The food was well presented too and was served on a cutting board. Looked very funky.There were lots of young people and there was a great laid-back atmosphere.All the food is halaal because the caf√© is muslim-owned which is a plus for muslim travelers.This cafe is a real gem and I would highly recommend that you visit and have a bite to eat

While exploring Haji Lane consider to stop for a while and have a bite in this great place. I stumbled upon it one day and since then I have visited this place several times for its well manered staff and the tasty food. The menu had a good selection of western food with an Asian touch that was reasonably priced. There are loads of different cakes and they all look great, especially the "Rainbow cake". I would also recommend the "Meatball sandwich" and the "Spicy beff & Mushrooms Pocket". And if you happen to be in the area on Sundays, try their Sunday¬¥s brunch.The service was quick, very efficient and friendly. And of course Jam¬¥s management is top: warm and highly professional.Summing up, a great place to eat at any time of the day, since they are open most of the day and offer food from breakfast to dinner

We found this place by chance after getting caught in the rain shopping on Arab street. From the start the service was excellent, offering us an umbrella to cross the road and they found us a seat out of the rain. The menu had a good selection of western food that was reasonably priced. We chose a chicken burger and a beef burger which were delicious. The service was quick and very efficient and friendly. We would definitely go back if we are in the area!

I stumbled upon this adorable little corner cafe while exploring Haji Lane an Arab Street. Very cool, unpretentious atmosphere, lots of young people, and great food. Fish and chips were delectable. I saw other dishes coming out and they all looked great. This place has only been open a bit more than a year and I see the ratings are bringing it quickly near the top for Singapore casual restaurants

There are 2 reasons why I love this cafe... Their phenomenal rainbow cake and their iced chocolate! Most pretty cakes don't taste as good as they look but this one definitely does!!! Everyone must order a slice of this cake if they go here! And an iced chocolate this cafe is pretty busy at night there is even a line up
5
Worth the 8 minute wait in the line to get a table for 1. Had the iced coffee, one of their mocktails (I asked the waiter to surprise me and it was delish!). Very refreshing to see something so well put together -from the decor, to food, to service, to ambience, and best of all, to see it popular with locals. Young crowd. Polite. Food is western, but with a neat twist and at a great competitive price. Not hawker food or food court price, but not Orchard street or Marina Bay prices either. A friend who lives in Singapore recommended it and he was 100% right. Need a coffee? Come here. Cool down with a mocktail and om nom nom. :) A place I'll definitely go back to

Although it is a small cafe, hidden at the corner of arab street, it serves great foood with reasonable price.

Nice innovative burgers and innovative drinks. Simple but good food and drinks. Perfect for a quick stop in arab quater.

The cake was really good... the food was pretty average. Nothing spectacular! Great for a quick inexpensive bite near Bugis. Good for outdoor seating as well... but maybe a bit tight for comfort.

Small little cafe, facing the Golden Landmark. It's always have been a long queue and seems like customers didn't mind (food must be good, ehh.. ). It's was late afternoon, around 3, so there's no queue (AT ALL!!) Waiting only took, say, about 5 mins. The food was superb .. but a little pricey, well, you can't get cheap these days. And it's Halal! Yay for me! My little Arie loved the fruit punch which comes with a cute little glass. Will come back again, same timing so I don't have to wait (HA!), been eyeing for other food

An interesting little cafe with personality on the corner of Haji Lane. Went there last week for a late lunch, ordered the burger and was not disappointed. Why would anyone go to the big boys when there are places like this! Service was great, menu was extensive, price was good and all Halal. What else could one ask for?
5
This cute little cafe is located on Haji Lane. I have been twice- at lunch and dinner and I would probably recommend lunchtime or early dinner before 6:30 so that you dont have to wait. THis place is unique as it only serves mocktails and is HALAL. I would definitely recommend for a quick bite to eat and some fancy drinks. Don't forget to try the yummy rainbow cake
5
This is a very cute a quaint cafe located on Haji St. A few steps away from the trendy new boutiques that are very affordable in Singapore, it is a perfect way to stop, eat snacks and drink coffee or tea. Delicous cakes along with iced coffee is what my wife and I ordered. The cake was in rainbow colors with rich icing in between. One slice was enough to share and we couldnt even finish it. The iced coffee cools you down from the humidity and heat.Yum

Wow I can't believe so many reviewers are being so harsh about this place! Ok ok it's not 5 star dining, but I know good food from mediocre food and this place is a great place to eat and catch up with friends ! The mocktail a were Fantastic, my husband loved his burger and my pizza was far from pretentious, it was simple and delicious ! It really hot the spot. We received great service, smiling waiters and very attentative.The rainbow cake WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD. THE BEST CAKE I HAVE TASTED!I'm not exaggerating I have had a lot of cakes and my friends you have to stop by and order cake and eat it here! It is huge so you must share with at least 2 other ppl. Unpretentious place that just serves up good food!!!

It's just a cafe, a tad over-rated. With that price, they should air-conditioned the whole area, it's sweltering hot eating outdoor in Singapore's weather. Menu is kinda limited, fish & chips, burger, pizza and some fried finger food. But the cakes were the saving grace. There's only about 3-4 types of cakes, that's it. Seats are too close. review is based on 2 visits, Lunch & early dinner

It was my first time having brunch with a friend on a Sunday. Knowing Singapore weather is warm and humid, the restaurant is not equipped with air-conditioners and ceiling fans are not very strong. The menu served on the Sunday was very limited. I ordered Grilled Ham and Cheese. Food presentation was good but would be better to serve on a bigger plate and sharper knife. The taste was just average. Nevertheless, the "Honeymooney" drink was great to have on a hot weather! I wouldn't come back as the restaurant can get too busy and my first experience was certainly HOT and MELTING
