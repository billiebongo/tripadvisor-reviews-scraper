If you are an Udon fan give this place a try they make it fresh and its very nice, a little expensive for Singapore food but very tasty !

Ordered the pork udon. Regular : SGD 9.80 No gst and service charge. This place is like fast food place for jap food. You can get water from the dispenser. You can also get refills of the broth. They have some condiments for your udon too e.g.. tempura crumbs, seaweed. The udon is really chewy, very nice. The pork tender and really yummy. I like it and am satisfied.

You choose a Base udon at the onset and proceed to choose tempura sides to go with it. I had a beef broth udon and got a prawn tempura and vegetables tempura as my sides. Free flow of ice and water, soup, tempura sauce, tempura bits as toppings, chilli, spring onions, wasabi, other condiments. Interesting concept, food does not disappoint.

Overall fast & convenient. Works like a foodcourt-cum-buffet.The overhead menus provide the basic noodle/rice with preferred topping. This is quickly served then patrons slide trays to choose sides, etc, before payment.It's very much a self-service eatery where utensils are throwaways and condiments laid out like in MacD's.Pricing and quality are decent.Would return for a quick meal

This is one of the best udon we have tasted outside Japan. We tried the Udon with pork, with beef and just plain udon - all tasted really good. But the tempura is not up to the mark. Easy to reach - just take the mrt (NEL or Downtown line) and align at the Chinatown station (NEL) or Downtown station (Downtown line). Both stations are linked to the basement 1 of Chinatown Point
