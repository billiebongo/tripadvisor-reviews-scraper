It's the second time I was there but this time, it's for takeout. Service was quick and the quality of food's good. What really impressed me was the first time I was there with my family for lunch, some weeks ago. The waiter was very thoughtful and we were the only customers at the outdoor section, yet he positioned another fan just so that our baby wouldn't be fried by the heat of the afternoon sun
