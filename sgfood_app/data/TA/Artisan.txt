Came here to kill some time and had a wonderful pull pork burger! Great comfort food! They provide free eater and make a mean chai tea. Well done!

Visited this artisan boulangerie a few times and always good. I like to have an eggs benedict now and again for breakfast or brunch and the one here is delicious. I usually have the salmon one with two poached eggs and crispy bacon on the side. There are other sides available as well. Service is always friendly and efficient. It is a family cafÃ© as well which gives it a good atmosphere. Highly recommend it

It was my first visit to this cafe and it definitely would not be the last. We had the mushroom soup, mushroom risotto and beef lasagna. The lasagna was alright but I love both the soup and the risotto. The complimentary chocolate caramel cake was delicious as well! Several of them were having the salad and I guess that should be delicious as well. We would definitely return

This is a regular haunt and my title isn't meant to be defamatory. When in Katong if you are looking for regular good quality european food and some delicious cakes and breads this is a great place to start. I love the chicken and avocado salad and it's good value too. The pasta is nice. Sure the portions aren't huge but so often we complain that our plates are too full. I also think in general Asian portions of food are smaller than the west and I approve. The coffee is good here too. The juices and smoothies although limited in choice are fresh and delicious. I like to sit out side because the sitcom is quite strong. The service is prompt and charming. No a place for a special occasion or romantic meal. But my choice of regular food with good value and many return visits

Are at this outlet with my mum, found the portion size generous. Prices for the main courses are around $20+, each drink between $4-$6. If you visit on weekdays lunch, there are special set menus that you can choose from.One call out is their Challah bread. Only available on Fridays and you will need to place reservation for it, one loaf is $5.50.

Great location with great coffee. I have visited this cafe several times and usually they are quite good but not this time. The avacado chicken bacon focaccia was terrible. Instead of being toasted, it was microwaved and combined with some old lettuce and tomato, the focaccia bread was soggy and unappealing. There were only tiny bits of avacardo and dried up bits of bacon. They have lots of other good things but need some help with focaccia bread - avoid ordering until they can improve!

Stopped by this place on a whim.The Good:1. The cappuccino was delicious, better than my experience of Starbucks I'd say.2. The chocolate brownie and fruit tart were both very nice.3. The cafe has a casual, cozy ambiance.4. Their biscottil is excellent!5. Warm, friendly service.The Not-so-good:1. Slightly expensive perhaps?2. The spotlights on the ceiling need to be better placed or adjusted as they tend to point directly downwards and cause a harsh glare in the eyes

It was a great find for some interesting bites. Price is OK, food was tasty and nicely garnished. Everybody in the family ordered differently and all the dishes turned out great. You order at the counter and they serve at the table. Some interesting drink mixes and healthy appetizers

This place has good sandwiches but the mains are so so. Have tried the chicken schnitzel which was a bit dry. Also pasta did not have that good "Italian" flavour.However Tuna-mayo sandwich is good with generous tuna, alfalfa sprouts, on a nice some what soft large bun for $8.00. Others, such as ham and cheese (on a harder roll) is also good. Add a nice soup such as Carrot Ginger or Mushroom, and you have a nice soup and sandwich lunch.This place is in the 112 Katong Mall which I freqeunt for lunch

Decided to try this after hearing much good stuff about their deserts. Ordered the mushroom soup, roasted chicken and ribeye.Mushroom soup: pretty normal but very very worth it for that price if you order a set, just need to add $5 for the soup or round up $30 for soup/salad and desert. Definitely not those from the can. Tasted fresh and top up with truffle oil.. Excellent (7/10)Ribeye medium cooked: served with fries, the quality of the meat was awesome , and cooked with some class. Medium came medium, not too rare or too well done. Potion was respectable too. $32 worth every cent (9/10)Roasted chicken: took a while to cook, but worth the wait totally. It was roasted in a hurry or overdone by amateur, the breast of the chicken was used, and the tenderness was EXCELLENT!! The meat melted in the mouth. $19 worth every penny. (8.5/10) think the only reason why it's not getting a prefect 10 is because I am more a beer person. Take this dish to any chicken lover and a 10 is what it will get.Service lastly was capital "E" Excellent.. Esp their female manager or supervisor by the name of "C....." Won't commend any names here but if you do go down, and check it out , you won't miss her
