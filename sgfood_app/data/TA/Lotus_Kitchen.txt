It is a vegetarian chinese restaurant and a very good one at that. The food was definitely tasty. They also had a decent variety of dim sum dishes as well. We will definitely visit this restaurant again.

Dinner for four at this restaurant. Entrance looked small but was rather spacious inside. Server was friendly and quick to recommend us dishes, this being our first visit. Extensive menu, from dim sum to regular noodles and rice dishes. Enjoyed their signature dish - dry laksa although it was a tad too spicy for me. On the whole, we found it was a welcomed dining experience. On the other hand, the place was slightly noisy, perhaps due to the busy shopper all around as it was close to the Lunar New Year. Price-wise, I think it is comparable to other vegetarian restaurants

The menu contains a relatively good spread and the dishes were interesting, creative, and with fresh ingredients and good flavours. We had two staples, one vegetable dish, and one summer wrap to share among the three of us, and three portions of different herbal soups and three drinks.The service staff were prompt and responsive, and the dishes were served in good time. The summer wrap is served in the style of Peking duck, but with the meat being replaced by crispy beancurd. The passion fruit strips added a cool, tangy taste. This dish is on the pricier side though.The eatery is conveniently located next to the Chinatown Point exit of the Chinatown MRT station on the Northeast Line. The floor space is not huge, but the tables are not packed too closely to one another. Having made reservations a day before, we had a round table near the main entrance, which was spacious for us since it could seat 6 persons

Went with family (group of 6) for weekend lunch, with booking. Service was poor - even though they were not busy with other tables (yet), the staff taking our orders was grumpy, bordering on rude, eg: did not make eye contact, corrected us as we were ordering, did not properly explain what was in the dish when asked. When dishes were served, some staff did not know what they were serving and had to go back to the kitchen to ask.Food was average quality. Portions were small for 6 persons - this was not explained to us when ordering. Food was presented on plates to try to make them look impressive, but that ended up taking too much unnecessary space on the table. Hence staff were in a hurry to clear plates to make space on the table for dishes as they arrivedSeating was uncomfortable and the whole place looked like an unfortunate hybrid between an IKEA restaurant and a hospital canteen - somewhat functional-looking but mismatched and cheap-looking tables and chairs. Dishes were overpriced - it is on the ground floor of Chinatown Point, facing the MRT exit (previous tenant might have been a jewellery store). Rent must be sky-high, and they obviously keep their staff costs down by hiring part-timers and don't train them.People who rave about this place obviously haven't had better food or service from a veggie restaurant....Everyone at my table decided we won't be going back
