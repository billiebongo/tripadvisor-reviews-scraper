We had an excellent dinner here last night.. Bamboo clams with garlic, prawns with vermicelli, mango sago with pomelo - all very good. Service was prompt and helpful. We plan to go back.

Food has become so expensive. A plate with ONE crab costs S$120. Will not return because not worth the money. This restaurant has been over rated by tourist books.

Excellent food quality, ok ambience with moderate service attitude from staff. Place may be a little warm for our foreign friends

The Chilli crab use to be one of the best i eat before, but recently go back again, the standard drop alot, Jumbo still better than them.

Yummy yummy - I prefer white pepper crabs because it is not spicy. Good for kids too. Also like their red bean pastry for dessert.

Ordered Alaska crab cooked two ways - chilli crab and salted egg crab. Both were delicious. Adults loved the chilli one, kids devoured the salted egg one. Another favourite was the cereal prawn - interesting textured. Sorry, only photo of the almost eaten food, as food was too yummy that I forgot to take photo first.

Ate here with a business colleague and we had a great evening. Razor clams, veggies, fresh shrimp all rounded off with a 1.7kg chilli crab. Service was brisk and friendly - unlike some reviews everyone could speak a little English and communication was not a problem - a smile goes a long way ! It was full of locals and Asian tourists and not western tourists - worth it just for that ! Price was very reasonable and a fraction of the cost of eating in the hotels in Singapore. I would definitely recommend this if seafood is your thing.

Love the original location at Geylang. But parking is a nightmare and valet service is almost mandatory. Friends from Malaysia rave about it and I totally agree. Succulent Sri Lankan crabs are de-rigeur. Bon appetite

We enjoyed our meal here
The chilli crab and pepper crab were delicious and I'd recommend the coffee pork, bizarre bit really good! Vibrant noisy atmosphere, perfect location and view.
I'd happily return.

Here you get to have your seafood dinner with the sea breeze. No signboard is famous for their white pepper crabs and rightly so! The white pepper crabs were juicy, aromatic, with a slight pepper kick!

Of its branches I like the one near the Esplanade. Smart idea to book a table as this place fills up.

Went with my firend here at their Clark quay outlet for dinner..cozy place to have dinner enjoying chat with your family or friend...i felt it is overly priced, one crab costed us almost double the price that i had paid at other sea food top 3 restaurant joints in singapore...one time visit is Ok...but the ambience is too good, the temporaray staff comprised of college going part-time boys & girls...we were served by a teenage girl...extremely helpful in deciding the menu... prompt service...hats off to her.. hte way she was working relentlessly ...guess they get pittnace for this kind of service comapred to thewir regular staff, yet they are the ones which keeps customer service so high...enjoyed the meal as such..

Considering this place prides itself on being the oldest and most traditional seafood, the service was pathetic, slow and with top notch attitude. The service was terrible even when there was only a handful of tables occupied.The crab was average, way too much batter and extremely salty. The price of the food was expensive for what it was, definitely disappointing and will not be back.Stay away from this place, if you want quality service and food at reasonable prices, go to Jumbo Seafood

I went with three friends and by the time they got round to serving us, I just decided to not eat. My friends meals were very tasty. But we actually had to ask for service to order and to get our check. They prices were high for what we got, even for Singapore, and they charged extra for the wet wipes and the peanuts they put on the table before we ordered. We spent about an hour longer than we wanted at the restaurant and left very disappointed

I had Chilli Crab and White Pepper Crabs on the 14th of April 2014 and honestly cannot say I have eaten both dishes and felt so disappointed.The Chilli Crab sauce was so watery and tasted nothing like the Chilli Crab Singapore is so famous for. It contained a very strong flavor of sambal which is odd.The White Pepper crab was average in taste and while the flavor was alright, it did not have the aroma of freshly ground quality white pepper which this signature dish is known for.I will not be going back again

We went to East Coast Seafood Centre as this was recommended for seafood lovers.There are about 8 restaurants and we had done a little bit of homework. Jumbo was packed out, but this has a reputation for being a bit generic and relies on hype. Red House did not look appetizing. The others were a mixed bag. The "No Signboard" restaurant beckoned because more local people were there and it had a warm ambiance. Service was impeccable, food was exquisite and described perfectly in the menu.The 'chilli crab' was a delight and so large it was painful, but had to be finished!!!The final bill was not a shock because we were kept appraised of rough cost of individual (by weight) items such as lobster.If you want to save money eat in Changi Village - very good food at an everyday price. If you want fantastic seafood blow the bank balance and go to "No Signboard" - 300 Singapore dollars for dinner for two was well worth it!!

my friends recommended me no signboard seafood but i think i went to the wrong place.the prawns we got are obviously not from the live tank but from the freezer.the chili crab is ok but not amazing.I won't come back. I heard that the outlet from same company in Geylang is much better.not sure we try it again in Geylang.the seating on east coast is right fronting the sea. that's the only positive note I will remember about this restaurant
