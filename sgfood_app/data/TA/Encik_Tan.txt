Not too bad for the price. It is quite crowded at times and many people are ordering their curry rice. Good for a quick meal with coffee/tea.

Enjoyed bowls of noodle at this restaurant. Food was okay except that the queuing time is quite a while. Be prepared to queue if u order noodle. Order rice, there will be no queue.

Its halal so everyone can enjoy their chinese style noodles like wanton mee. their curry rice is addictive you can enjoy it with chicken prawns squid or fiah and it comes with fried egg and veggies.

Several run ins with complaints against outside food, but finally certified to dispel outlet has yet to gain their certificate. Great curry rice, but queue can be too long if looking for a quick bite.

Found the food to be nice and good value for money. However, the queue was long and when we got to the front, we were told some of our items needed to be ordered at another counter. Staff were also not very accommodating. I strongly suggest larger and more obvious signs

Love their fried kway teow, laksa and curry squid rice. This is not as big as other places, e.g. Bedok.They have separate cashiers for different dishes, which can be confusing and time consuming if you want to order several dishes.Perhaps it would be simpler to have a main cashier station for ordering, then different points to collect the dishes

The menu looks interesting and simple so we decided to dine here.Bought the fish ball + cake noodle and it was good!The price is very reasonable, you should try it if you are here.Service was fast and there was quite a crowd patronizing the outlet when we were there

While we were window shopping around Bugis Plus, we lunched at Encik Tan, 1st I wanted to order Laksa but then I decided to order the Signature dish which is fishball noodles, the Signature fishball was not like I expected, totally not delicious. My nephew ordered Hainan chicken curry, it looks nice but my nephew said the fried chicken was hard, not fresh.

Different outlets sell different varieties of food, but there is always the stores that sell the Hainanese curry rice and drinks present. For this branch at Waterway Point, Punggol, two stores selling curry rice, laksa, fishball noodles and wanton mee are present here.I would recommend trying out the laksa noodles or the Hainanese chicken cutlet curry rice. The curry rice comes with the meat of your choice (chicken, prawn or fish), rice, a fried egg, some pickled cabbage and their signature curry sauce. The laksa's broth is tasty and flavourful and the spiciness isn't too overwhelming. If you order a main course from them, you can purchase lime juice at a discounted price for only SGD$1.00

Its cheap, tasty and straightforward. Fastfood style meal and it is nice if you want to get something fast and fresh. Try the chicken cutlet meal. All rice meals come witha fried egg, rice, their signature curry sauce and pickled veggies. Btw, they sell noodles too
