This buffet has been around for the longest time and never fails to impress. Delicious Peranakan cuisine and international favourites in a beautifully furnished interiors showcasing motive and arts of the Straits Born Chinese race

Enjoyed their peranakan buffet. Great place to dine with family and friends.Many varieties of dishes.
5
Buffet had a really wide spread with lots of varieties. The peranakan buffet was very good; with fresh durian as well.
4
Keep up the good work Hazel! She is friendly and pleasant! Hope to see more young and cheerful service staff in F&B!

Went for high tea with my good friends. Wide selection of food and good service. Kim Melissa attended to us and she was attentive and constantly refill our tea and clear the dishes. Will definitely be back again.

This is the second year we‚Äôve gone for Chinese New Year‚Äôs eve Reunion dinner at Ellenborough Market and totally enjoyed it. They serve all the favorite, auspicious dishes, including Yu Sheng, plus some Peranakan dishes for those who are craving a bit more kick with each bite. Desserts are a mix of classic Peranakan kuehs, plus my personal favorite fresh durian pengat (literally flattened durian). Yum!! They also have a lion dance troupe performing loudly midway through the evening to really make the night festive and memorable.

This elegant place offers a great variety of food from this part of the world, served in a very appetizing way. I liked the seafood best but tried some of the meat as well. So much to try...Just to look at all the different desserts was fun! Some of them were good and some were something you have to get used too. 15 S$ for one beer is expensive though! Friendly and efficient staff.

We had a buffet dinner here yesterday. There was a wide selection of Peranakan cuisine plus Japanese sushi and sashimi as well as seafood. The Nyonya laksa was excellent as was the pongteh. The bubur cha cha is not the same as that in Malacca and was a little disappointing. Nevertheless, the other dishes I tried were excellent and brought back very fond memories of my childhood in Malacca and my grandmother‚Äôs excellent cooking of Nyonya food. The sweet corn ice cream was also excellent as were the Nyonya desserts.

If not for the good prompt service from the prc staff, i would have rated 1 star instead of 2 stars. Was there on 20Jan 2018 for buffet dinner at $68++ per adult. I think for such food¬† standard, maybe $48++ still not justifiable. "Durian Pengat" by 20:40HRS are gone...no refill! (Buffet closes at 21:30HRS) Meat carving section only one miserable small roast beef....btw is this a halal restaurant (no pork no chicken)? Kueh n dessert worse than any hawker stalls (flavour-less kuehs n cakes confirm low cost ingridents).zha jiang mian@ÁÇ∏ÈÖ±Èù¢ sauce so fake...come on, bulk purchase of the original sauce in sg ÁîúÈù¢ÈÖ± will cost the hotel restaurant at less than sgd$0.40 per 100grams! Slipper lobsters all dried up! Tuna sashimi not replace when darken after placing for more than an hour. No oysters, And still got the cheek to do discreet upselling by setting a sugar cane juice station in between the buffet spread (selling sgd$3.50++). Warm coffe served (pre dispense by putting it in a pot). Brand it as peranankan style but is not authentic at all (if this is the reason for no oysters)...no chendul no assam laksa...so why is call peranankan style?In short, standard drop after renovation. The management have to try better to think hard to either reduce price or value add...as i believe biz will not improve with such standards...was not packed at all on saturday evening ....will not go back again n not recomending any friends unless there is an improvement on the buffet spread

I had the Nonya High Tea and it is very good. This is located in Merchant Court Hotel and i was surprised it was so popular. When I reached the restaurant at 3.25pm, there was already a long queue of about 40 pax. Luckily, we had reserved a table. The variety of food is good, with Nonya, Chinese, Japanese and Indian food.The satay was the best. The ending was a bit disappointing though as the waitress who came to bill us has to go and ask her supervisor questions. Each time took her 10-15 minutes and she seemed to be the only one bringing bills to all the customers in the restaurant. I estimated i only left the restaurant about 50 minutes after i asked for the bill.
4
Lunch at the Ellenborough Market Cafe was good. A wide range of peranakan and Xmas items. Service staff was quite slow in the clearing of plates but when they were called, they did it with a smile. Price was on a steep side though.
5
Excellent service by Kim Melissa Hwang, who was very attentive to our needs, prompt with service and always serving with a smile. The food selection was great and our dining experience was made more delightful with the warm hospitality of the service staff.
4
Went for the buffet. Must try the durian pudding. Good spread of food available. Sushi üç£ is fresh too.
5
Food was excellent. Great variety of western, chinese and perenakan food. The dessert selection was very good. Place was cosy, service was attention. Cashier can be improved. Perhaps to go to customers to settle bill earlier.
3
The food selection was quite small. We were asked to settle the bill only 1 hr into the buffet, felt very rushed. At about 10mins to the end of buffet, the glutinous balls were already cleared. Felt very rushed throughout the meal
1
I thought the food here should be real good I was disappointed on almost everything.
Everything look good but taste bad !!!!

My husband and I decided to eat here for our Christmas dinner as it seemed comparatively better value for money than elsewhere and the posters (see picture) sold the Christmas buffet as a traditional Christmas feast. What a joke! We had high expectations as the hotel is wonderful but they should absolutely not be associated with this substandard restaurant. We were seated and no drinks order taken. When we got the attention of a young male waiter to order he subsequently ran away never to return. After three attempts and a forty minute wait we got our drinks. We had asked for the free-flow package which we had booked prior to our arrival but two of the staff we asked had no idea what we were on about (see advert) so we ended up having to pay for individual drinks. The food was appalling. So much for a Christmas feast, the best we could find was some turkey/gammon hidden amongst the cheese boards and over cooked Brussels sprouts. No gravy, potatoes, vegetables or anything resembling a Christmas dinner. At one point we were so confused by the lack of Christmas dishes that we asked a member of staff where the pumpkin soup was. The member of staff actually shooed is away! Appalling!! We were so disappointed by the service and the poor, bland and cold food. If you are looking for a traditional Christmas dinner steer clear of this place and in fact we wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t return under any circumstances.
5
The meal is what you would expect from a high-end international buffet, but what was memorable and gave my family and I a good time was the service of 2 excellent staff, Mr Harry and Ms Sonia. They were proactive in our needs, especially to my young children and were understanding and accommodating in every aspect. Throughout our meals, it was not the food, but their excellent service that made my time with my family cosy and pleasant. Highly recommended for the service of the staff

We went there for our department's christmas lunch and there were about 9 of us. We had a lovely round table all to ourselves at a nice quite corner. While that was a delight, the selection of food choice was rather disappointing. While to some extend the Peranakan theme was something unique and different, they did not hold up the quality to follow suit. The steam fish in teochew sauce was fishy (since it was left out for a number of hours) and the filling for the kueh pie tee was too soft (constant boiling in the hot pot). We hope the restaurant will keep up with their QC for a better dining experience
5
Family lunch on a Saturday before Christmas. Nice food... something for everyone. For those who love peranakan food, there is a section catered just for you. Make your own kuih pie tee by filling these top hats with your choice of fillings. A speciality here is the durian pengat dessert which some people will go gaga over. Sashimi was good and fresh and cut to a nice thickness. Herbal soup was good as were the other various dishes. Good variety of desserts too. Great choice for a family with diverse eating habits.
4
Was there to celebrate birthday with friend. Decent spread of buffet items and the food taste good. Unlike other hotels, Ellenborough is spacious! We were slightly disappointed as they did not serve mee siam.
5
The spread of food is good. My children enjoyed themselves. My Friend also like the variety of food.
5
This is the 2nd time to Ellenborough Market and it just as good as my impression of my first visit. Recommended.

We had dined in Ellenborough Market Caf√© a number of times over the years and it had been almost a year since we last ate there. The place appeared to have been recently refurbished, which was a welcome change to the old look. Staff were extremely polite and attentive.Previously we felt the menu and food quality had been gradually declining in quality and taste. It has much improved during this recent meal. The theme of the food is still the same ‚Äì cold seafoods like crayfish, cold shrimp and sushi. There was cooked food like mussels, clams, the ‚Äúbig fish‚Äù, local favourites like mee rubus and do-it-yourself popiah, desserts, salads, breads, indian cuisine, and of course the usual favourite ‚Äì durian pengat.Overall we felt the quality and standard of the restaurant has been revived along with the facelift. Will definitely return again
5
The cafe have a lot of good food . Is a international buffet a lot of choice and the staff here also very friendly especially a girl name Neha. Very helpful and we have a wonderful afternoon chat with our dear friends . Cafe also very wonderful ! Wonderful cafe , wonderful food and wonderful staff ! I will be bac

I've eaten here several times while a guest at the Swissotel Merchant Court in which it's located. They have a great variety of breakfast items, from the conventional "western" fare to Asian dim sum, congee, and noodles. My only criticism is that I seem to weigh more when I leave than when I arrive :
5
We have used the Ellenborough Market Cafe for breakfast and dinner.The breakfast always has a great selection of different foods including fresh cooked eggs. It's a great start to the touring day.The dinner buffet has such a great choice of all kinds of Asian cuisine that you would need several sittings to be able to try everything. Our whole family treats that as a highlight of our Singapore stopovers.It would not be the least expensive Singapore dining option, but it is worth it and I heartily recommend it

On 11 Nov 2017 Saturday went for a buffet lunch with my family.Ellenborough Market Place.Was very impressed with the new decor and the changeover. More spacious, great colour combination and so much brighter. Unfortunately, I was a lit bit put off by the drop in your service standard. The chinese lady with no name tag told my mother that they don't serve tea for buffet. We had been patronising Ellenborough for many many years and she told us that they don't serve Tea for buffet. Luckily I went to one lady called KIM MELISSA HWANG, she told me that they servetea and she went out of her "territory" to bring my mum a cup of tea.(Even though she is not in charge of our area. Melissa was so very professional even though I learnt she was only a part-timer. She should be immediately put on to full time work, if she want to. A great asset to any f&b operations And it was also because of her, I still want to consider coming back for lunch. Please offer more supervision to those waitress with no name tags. Do you know they even spilled hot tea over my wife. Incredible!!!!! (Sorry also no use... )One of your Chef who is in charge of the Hi Tea personally came to our table and shake hands with my family on hearing that my Dad had passed away two years ago.He once used to help my Dad with his plate to the table. My Dad was very impressed with him. Ellenborough was our last buffet dinner with him.....Anyway, I am sure you understand why I am writing to you. Please don't let a few untrained and unprofessional people tarnish your good service and excellent reputation and great food. Many thanks....Phili

I would suggest to sit in the open cafe area overlooking Clarke Quay. The service and food here is outstanding and not too heavy on the dollar either. Being a vegan family, we had plenty of options which was reassuring. The staff were extremely delightful. Would surely be back here given a chance!
4
The durian pengat is excellent. Great overall spread of dishes. Peranakan dishes like laska and kueh pie tee tend to be better than the normal Chinese or Western food spread. Ms Melissa Lim provided great and efficient service. Will definitely be back again with my family
3
Choice of foods were so limited!
Kuay n cake for high tea are so important but hardly find those common ones! Lousy spread!
3
The place is too crowded. A lot of tables. Should duplicate some items to prevent long queue especially the 'hot' items like Sashimi and the Durian paste. Not value for money. Service not up to hotel standard.
4
Variety is good but quality of food seemed to have dropped a little (durian pengat).
Laksa is good and sashimi is very fresh. Large range of dessert though
5
Yummy breakfasts. We would eat late in the morning & didn't need to eat until dinner time, which was yummy too.
3
This is attached to the Swisshotel but walk in are welcome. There is inside and out side seating. It can get busy so it can get noisy. Caters for westerners and Asians. WE only went there for Breakfast. The usual Asian foods, omelette bar, cereals, fruits, pastries etc etc. We didn't eat there on out last day at the hotel but went across the road to Starbucks for something different as the buffet was the very similar each day. It was Ok and if included in your stay it will be just fine. Otherwise there are options across the road at the shopping centre for breakfast
4
This is one of my first few buffet haunt years back. They have refurbished the interior into a more clean look with a splash of local culture. Foodhall spread is ok, don't expect a huge variety. Durian pur√É¬©e was the best! Standard of sushi dropped though.
4
Went there for a weekend dinner. Place is known for its durian pudding and peranakan dishes which i am not keen on, but it has other items like a cold and hot shellfish (prawns, crabs & crayfish) spread, sashimi and desserts. Most dishes good though there were a couple that were disappointing (laksa too salty, salmon pastry tasted odd, ice cream had weird flavours)
4
My family of ten had my sister and cousin's post birthday celebration at Ellenborough Market Cafe. It was quite an ideal choice as it was a good spread of local peranakan food, good curry, fresh steamed sea bass, japanese sushi, fresh sashimi and wide spread of local desserts too. It was definitely a good wrap up celebratory meal for my sister and cousin's birthdays
5
Basically EMC at Swissotel Merchant Court has become a frequent dining location for me and my friends! Service is top-notched, attentive and prompt! Food is generally well assorted with the occasional changes in themes! Our recent visit was Singapore Local Fare which was a great selection with an assortment of International cuisine as well as seafood choices! As the usual standards of great service was consistent but really propelled me to write this review and compliment is not to mention the past accolades in my previous reviews but to highlight a commendable management decision!I was served by a senior staff who is probably in his 40s-50s and i am amazed at his level of proficiency! His service skills are well-honed and you could obviously tell that he had years of experience in the service and food industry! Service finesse and his niceties are in abundance and he was extremely hospitable and friendly. Service was prompt and also extremely applaudable! I think that the management of hotel and in particular the restaurant have great strategies in place to hire such talents despite their age as it obviously shows that experience is definitely a commodity that is worth more than youth! I would like to commend the management for their stance in this matter and also the staff for his dedication and kind service rendered that night! P.S. Perhaps the freshly squeezed sugarcane could have been complimentary

I was at first excited when my friend suggested that our group of 13 go to Ellenborough Market Cafe for the buffet dinner on 18 Aug 2017 as I had a pleasant experience when I ate at this restaurant many years back. Moreover, my friends have 2 Farcard Gourmet cards that offered 50% discount, so we thought why not.I was greatly disappointed that within minutes of arriving at the restaurant, we became infuriated even before we started the buffet course. As we did not understand why the management needed to put a table with a 30cm gap between our tables, their rationale that since we were using 2 cards, we must separate tables. As we had done bookings with other hotels, where we enjoyed the 1-for-1 buffet with certain credit cards, the restaurant management at other hotels did not insist that we separate tables but would bill us separately. Please note that we were speaking in a reasonable tone and voice, when a friend tried talking to a manager, Benjamin Liew, I heard her calm voice became more and more agitated, and I wondered why as my back was towards them. With my mind set on telling my friends to accept the gap and moved on, I turned to talk to this Benjamin Liew and casually mentioned that it was weird how their policy was such when in the past I had no such problem, the next moment I felt infuriated as this Benjamin Liew first raised his eyebrows and using a condescending tone replying "Is it?", clearly questioning what I just said. His whole body language, manner, and tone, clearly showed us that he was not suitably trained and totally unprofessional. Worse, even after we asked for his superior, he stood there like a statue and refused to budge until we insisted. The whole service in this restaurant was so appalling. The serving staff took so long to ask if we wanted a drink, and when we noticed an ant in a cup, they removed without a word of apology. I couldn't review on the food as we had no appetite to stay there for our dinner, it was a gathering of friends to have a good time and we certainly not letting such unprofessional service ruined our evening.We were happy to bring our business to Peony Jade Restaurant with good service and attitude, and we had such a great time there. And I will never go back to Ellenborough Market Cafe ever again and obviously, I refused to rate with any points
3
Nice variety of Singaporean cuisine as part of their National Day celebration. Chili crab, however, was not that great but everything else was good. A little pricey though. Could have offered free flow of drinks for that price.
4
Lunch here was excellent. A really good spread of Peranakan food and I enjoyed it very much. I have to mention the traditional "kueh" - they were great and brought back memories for me.
4
Enjoyed our afternoon tea buffet at ellenborough market! Especially enjoyed the sashimi, and making our own kueh pie tee!
4
Service not too good... took a long time for a person to attend to a table. Disappointed that we are unable to change table but others are able..
5
This is our favourite place for buffet.
We like the durian pengat, sashimi and nonya cuisine.
All the staff are very friendly, especially Kate Fong, Sandie Thung and Linda Ho at reservation.
5
Staying at the wonderful Swissotel Merchant Court, we had breakfast in the cafe each morning. The food was more than plentiful, always fresh, and the chefs on hand to cook up eggs just how you like them was a joy. I put on weight thanks to the assortment of delicious foods available here each morning
4
~both 2017Jun & 2016Oct dinner buffet were a hit for my kids~easy to park right next to the lift and take a short walk up to the caf√É¬©~reservations are a MUST but you really don't have to wait till they reset for the buffet to start at 6.30pm, you can actually ask for early seating and order an ala carte drink before the buffet begins beating the very long queues to get in at 6.30pm~note I used the 50% discount coupon from the FAR Card which accounts for the bill both times~service is generally very courteous and prompta sumptuous spread that is very local, nonya favorites abound and a very good sampler if you are bringing foreign guests...!definitely a local favorite haunt
5
We enjoyed breakfast each day at the Ellenborough Market Cafe. We preferred to sit outside most mornings as we enjoy Singapore's warm weather. The food selection is very good and we noticed that there is a small selection for people who require gluten free food. The staff are always very friendly and we would like to mention Peter, Vincent, Max, Molly and Johanna who made our breakfast times enjoyable.
4
We had breakfast as part of our stay the Swissotel and can definitely say it was worth it. There is pretty much anything you could ask for of breakfast. The buffet style breakfast covers Asian to Western, they have it all, chefs make your omelettes to order and the cooked breakfast of beans, bacon, sausages, potatoes and toast (my favourite) tops it off. There is more healthier options of course. It is also awesome for kids as it caters for most of their tastes even down to the cereal
5
breakfast was a thing of beauty. Breakfast was the most opulent thing I have ever seen, there was a station full of western cooked breakfast items, a station full of Indian cooked breakfast options, a station full of Singaporean breakfast items, a station for eggs (custom made omelettes, fried eggs, poached eggs, etc) a station full of bread items and a station purely for healthy food options. My husband had the best crispy bacon every morning and I had the best Bircher muesli I have ever eaten.Highly recommended
4
This is a value for money buffet if you have the FAR card. This month is slightly more expensive as they have the durian desert theme. The durian pengat is one of the best in Singapore. The crayfish dish is still good as ever.
5
This is one of my favourite places for buffet. I love the spread of seafood and nonya cuisine. The cafe is a great place to gather with family members and friends! And most importantly, the price is reasonable!
2
The lunch buffet is quite disappointing and not value for money .
However, the service provided by Max and Kate are superb .
5
Ellenborough Market cafe has always been famous for their Peranakan-styled buffets, and last night did not disappoint. The kueh pie tee, laksa, fish head curry and sambal fried rice were all on point. The durian pengat is to die for as well. However, it was their service that really impressed me. We had last minute additions to our table and needed an extra large table for 11. The manager Mr Yusof kindly accommodated our request and made sure we were all seated together. It is the extra mile that service staff go to and the pride that they take in their work that makes all the difference. Will definitely be back
1
Had a go at their lunch buffet as we were staying at the hotel but the food and spread were both such a disappointment :(10/10 would not visit again.. Poor variety, seafood not fresh, indian cuisine cold and oily (unappetizing).. Peranakan food was better though I ve definitely had better.. The bill came up to about $65/pax for lunch, v pricey for the food and variety they served.. plenty of other hotel buffet lunches that can offer more for that price..
4
Made a reservation for my parents and aunt for a July birthday get-together via CHOPE, based on my last visit to Ellenborough Market Cafe a long time ago. And... They were NOT disappointed! Thoroughly enjoyed the food, and excellent service from Max and Irene. Still talking about it as we speak! The Peranakan spread was of a good and authentic standard, with fresh seafood and sashimi. A lovely way to spend a rainy, cool and enjoyable Friday, paired with delicious food and delectable company! Now, I'll definitely have to make a trip myself!

It has been a while since i last visited Ellenborough. In it's hey days, like 10 years back, you will probably have to beg and steal to get a table at this premise. Their Durian penyet and Fried Crayfish is their signature (and now as well), and people come all over to have a taste of it. My previous review of Ellenborough was nothing more than worthless. It was filled with poorly managed stalls, mediocre staff performance and bad management. Things have changed. I came back after series of positive word of mouth.Firstly, cafe has been renovated (quite a while back) and it looks fresher and more spacious. Secondly, there are designated desert counters and live cooking station (i have had foie gras, Fried Kway Teow during my recent visits). Thirdly, it is so much better managed under a new manager Steven with his line of new crew who are young (some are interns) and the seniors (whom i have always been supportive of, to encourage them to carry on working if they are well bodied). I was also fortunate to have been served by a very enthusiastic and sincere intern - Rana. I really wish to see more of such energetic and positive staff attitude in the service industry. It makes a hell lot of difference in the dining experience. Food wise, standards for the popular Durian penyet and Crayfish are well maintained and the queue remains. There is a wider selection of sashimi and live seafood; oysters, alaskan crab etc, that continues to attract a long queue. My only complain is that there are some people who doesn't observe the long queue and cut in front of others, disregarding the other customers that have been lining up. Even this is something that may happen in buffet places, it should not be happening in the more up-market places. I don't observe such mayhem at buffet in Fullerton, Ritz, and St Regis. The buffet is priced at 68++ and Far Card or Love Dining guests get discount on their dining (tiered discount that varies with the number of guests, the best is 50% for 2 diners). Transportation wise, take the North east line to Clark quay station and follow the signage that points towards Swissotel Merchant Court. The cafe is at the right corner at the lobby level. Personally, i prefer the seating area near the main hot food area. It is for a selfish reason.. i can better monitor the queue
4
While most services staff were on the ball to clear plates and answer any questions, Sandie was extra attentive to meet my needs. As it was buffet style, she reduced the food portion for laksa to that we can try other food over our time here. In addition to that, she served with warmth, and check back with diners with regards to the counter she is in charge of - Peranakan food. Good Service
5
Celebrated by son's 18th birthday at the Caf√©. First of all, the person who took my reservation and taking note of my requirement for my son's party was already incredibly impressive (I apologized I didn't take note of the name). This didn't end here. At the party, the table was well set up and the service by this wonderful gracious lady Yu Si is just extremely impeccable. I then recollected that she was also the one who served my other few dining experiences at the caf√© the previous months. Wow! she was just excellent in her job! Wished all staff are trained like her - service with a smile and detailed oriented and most of all, delivering good service.My son had the best party ever and thanks to Yu Si for her services ranging from helping with the balloons, to the party packs and the cake cutting despite the crowd. She handled the bill efficiently too and most of all, composed, smiling and delivering her very best. I cannot thank her enough for making a party a huge success.If anyone would like to have a small party with great food and good service, Ellenborough is THE CHOICE! AND OF COURSE ASK FOR YU SI (HA HA HA).Glad I could share this experience with all those reading this review.Thank you Yu Si for being there for us on Saturday. Will always remember you.for your excellent, impeccable and leaving a lasting impression of your goodself
5
I am celebrating a birthday and selected this restaurant where I can find good variety of buffet food at a reasonable price. My friends love this place where the quality of food is good, clean and upbeat ambience, good service staff whose always attentive and clearing the tables. I like to commend one of your service staff, a Miss Yu Si who is an excellent service staff. She was always seen to be working to clear the tables for the guests and providing assistance to anyone who needed help. She's always smiling and helpful and despite some rude guests who seems to have taken advantage of her kindness by ordering her around, she's never frown or responded rudely in any form.When I arranged for the cake to be presented for the birthday cutting ceremony, she's very prompt to ensure the guests and taken care of and my friends really had a memorable time and enjoying the food and excellent service. She is a model staff and should be commended by the hotel and restaurant

Satisfactory spread and nice tasting food. Prawns and oysters are fresh. Crayfishes are delicious. Traditional Muah Chee are served warm coated with toasted peanut bits, taste great!!!
2
Crab cuisines are alright but dessert extremely too sweet. Lobster bisque not up to standard and the rest are normal. Standard of food really not as a few years ago so wonder chefs have changed. So family members especially mum quite disappointing with it.
4
The international buffet spread was good, given that it was just a high tea buffet. Worth trying if you haven't been there before!
5
Great food and ambience
Love the wide selection and freshly prepared food
Only down side the crab feast is a bit disappointing but the nonya was great
4
A vast room with endless stations offering the freshest of local and international dishes. Caters to a variety of tastes and nationalities. Can carry you to dinner!

I held my daughter's first birthday at the Ellenborough Market Cafe on Sunday and the high tea party was a great success! We had about 50 odd guests in total, including several kids and everyone had a good time. The food selection was plentiful and replenished often, the setting was nice and i love the area they cordoned off for my party. I want to extend huge thanks to Linda for coordinating the booking and planning for me. She was extremely patient and lovely over the phone and was very prompt with her follow ups. A big thanks too the staff on duty on Sunday, especially Serena, Benjamin and the tall Chinese gentleman, with glasses. Im so sorry i forgot his name but he was so polite! Feedback from my guests was that service was very efficient, polite, plates cleared, water glasses refilled, and the staff were very pleasant, especially Serena and the tall Chinese gentleman. They did their best to accede to all my requests with the cake, the balloons, the clearing of tables, getting the baby chairs, and sorting out parking coupons for me. You guys are great! I held another birthday party for my son 2 years ago and couldnt hold one last year as the restaurant was under renovation. With the revamp, it's good to know that service standards are still as high and i look forward to returning to the Ellenborough Market Cafe again. Well done to a great team

I would have given 5 stars rating if not for the poor service at the Ellenborough Market Cafe !1 star at the Ellenborough Market Cafe :-As we wanted to have steaks instead of their usual famed buffet. We booked ala carte dinner for 5 at the Ellenborough on Sat 8th July, arrival from 6.30pm - 7pm. Went down to the cafe during lunch time to confirm the reservation as well as the assigned table which we were told is a round table.Dinner time, went down earlier at 6pm but was assigned a different table which is smaller and rectangle table instead if the round table. Sat down but no staff attended to us nor interested in taking down our orders... Had a chance to ask the Restaurant Manager or Person-in charge "Mr Benjamin Liew" why we were given a different table and not the prior reserved table. I quoted his reply " because service line is like that, if customer insist, they have no choice..." ! His half-hearted reply is another group came a minute earlier and insisted to sit on our reserved round table and so the Manager allowed them to do so... what kind of logic ?Service and Serving was extremely slow and we noticed that staff seemed uninterested in serving our table maybe because we ordered ala carte menu instead of opting for their buffet dinner ? Our steak orders took a long time to arrive and even our cake (reserved in advance - complimentary from Amex Platinum) took another 15 mins to arrive and we have to ask for serving plates and forks/spoons for the cakes... everything have to ask and prompt the staff there instead of being part and parcel of their service... ?Previous dining experiences at the Ellenborough were fine and well-attended, probably our reservations were handled by Amex Platinum Concierge. But this time, we booked the dinner directly. Wondered is there any discrimination... ? Overall experience at the Swissotel Merchant Court is Average 3 stars (instead of 5 stars), totally let down by the poor service at their Ellenborough Market Cafe

We had a family get together buffet lunch for 10 of us. We were really impressed with the attentiveness and smiles that we got. The food is good but the service excellent. Special commendation to Yusi and Minnie who worked non stop to clear plates, top up water, take additional orders. It's wonderful to be greeted with smiles not just from two staff but from the entire serving crew on 8 July 2017. Thank you!!!! Rebecca n troop

Disappointing. We were expecting a crab buffet and paid for such but it was the same normal spread with some crab. That beehoon with crab and broccoli with crab should not be considered as crab dishes. Crab buffet season in SGP is between May and June. There are a lot of better crab buffets than this.
3
Buffet spread was disappointing. Unlike previous visit, food was mediocre and not enticing. Wanted a bowl of laksa but noodles were ran out way before the first hour of opening with no other options but offered with yellow hokkien noodles which just was not appealing at all

Had the crab buffet dinner. Variety of crab dishes were not bad. However, the cooked crab shells seemed to be harder than those you eat at the seafood dinner. Other dishese were good as well. Kway pie tee is on of the better ones eaten.
4
We enjoyed the lunch buffet at Ellenborough Market Cafe, though we were hoping that there would be a wider spread. Perhaps, can add a few more live stations like noodle station, satay station etc?
1
Foreign Staff were not helpful. Spilled water while refilling.
Dropped my knife and asked for clean one- China waitress took her time to replace it.
Poor coffee and tea taste.
Limited variety of food. Won't come back again.
4
The desserts bar is really exquisite. Mouth watering. Good service and spacious place. Suitable for families of young and old.

Haven't been here for some time; the new look was refreshing and gives a more relaxed feel.Not only was it an international buffet, it was also crab night. So we had different kinds of crab cooked in a variety of ways. There were the usual seafood like prawns, scallops, mussels, oysters and sashmi. There was also a good spread of Peranakan food. There was also beef etc.I always enjoy the desserts, though the kuehs were disappointing and the durian penget seemed a bit less concentrated than what I remembered from the past.The service was polite and helpful though they lacked initiative. When we were seated, the cutlery and finger bowl for eating crab etc were not at the table. We had to ask for them. We had to ask for water too. It could be the lack of manpower in a busy restaurant; the management should look into improving their service if it is to compete with many other fine buffets in the city.I find the price of the buffet dinner far too high. If I didn't have a discount voucher, I wouldn't eat here
5
I booked a dinner buffet for my bf to celebrate our first staycation out together. Spread is really good, staff are friendly. The atmosphere is homely, made me feel happy and relaxed. Oh and the crab feast was so delightful, I will recommend you to try it. As expected, my favourite dessert was the durian penyet!
3
The restaurant is so noisy, full of "Animals". Has to quene 30 minutes for Foie Gras. Since there wa a quene for this live station, the Chef should limits the numbers of foie gras that a customer should take, instead of giving the customer a full plate of foreign gras, at least ten pcs on a plate. Lot of greedy people, took at least five to six pcs of slippery lobster on a plate. There was no dessert spoon. No spoon given when tea/coffee was served.
4
True to its Peranakan theme, the traditional desserts and dishes were well represented. There were enough to satisfy a diverse palate for both young and old. The big ticket items like foie gras, cold crab and peppered crayfish were very popular. However, it could have been better if the toast for the foie gras was more crispy and not rushed; too much water trapped in the crabs and the sauce for the crayfish made more intense. The service was wonderful; very attentive and efficient staff despite the rather hectic pace of the dining hall. The poultry meat were of poor texture; clearly frozen and tough. They do injustice to the well prepared spices. Price wise, given our Farcard discounts and $60 voucher, we ended up paying $120++ for 3 persons, which is pricey. Upon reflection, none of the dishes stood out. Perhaps, they should focus on creating a few signature dishes that will give them the competitive edge in the buffet competition and entice repeat patrons.

Firstly, as previously mentioned the newly renovated EMC is indeed more spacious and easier to navigate around. It also boasts new Neo-colonial Peranakan touches that goes in line with their line-up of food. Secondly the price is extremely affordable if you're an American Express Platinum card member. Seafood spread includes salmon and tuna sashimi as well as light Japanese appetisers. Freshly shucked oysters, Alaskan king crab, mussels and prawns are also very popular. We were there for the foie gras promotion which included pan fried, terrine etc but because it's extremely overwhelmed you might need to be patient and join the queue. Hotel can consider limited number of pieces per customer per queue because there are individuals that take like a plate of 10. Also had some storage issue because was there with a big suitcase, but concierge refused to store the bag as I'm not a guest which I clearly understand because of security risks. But when I asked the restaurant, I was also denied despite concierge asking me to put in the bag for storage via the restaurant. But it was a small issue, but management may like to review communications amongst departments to ensure continuity. Cause it's quite irrelevant when someone says this while the other say that. Lastly, any restaurant can put food on a plate or display them and charge a price. But it's the service that really matters. Staff were attentive and helpful, my compliments to Zhi Qi who was particularly exemplary because she is able to notice a customer who dropped a cutlery and came back with a new one without being asked. Hardworking and also extremely hospitable in her niceties. It is obviously a great manager that instills such values, Mr Steven was there at the front line to greet customers, making his rounds to check on everything and ensure perfection in every touch point in the customers' dining experience. I was particularly impressed when he even offered to decant our red wine which was a outstanding personal touch that even many famous establishments do not practice! We will definitely be back for more
4
Since we frequent this place, the food was just the same. But if you've got guest, this is a decent spread for local food. Get them to try the durian paste. Was disappointed coz when we called to make reservations, we were told there will be foie gras. We booked the dinner hoping for that in the menu but it wasn't. Anyway, saving grace was the staff named Navdeep Rana. He was wonderful. Very attentive to our needs and always serving with a smile. It was a busy friday night but Rana seemed so delighted serving us
4
My parents and I were satisfied with the food selection given the price. There were sufficient seafood, foie gras, other kinds of meat, and some desserts. My only complaints are that no soft drinks are available (what??) and that desserts didn't include fruit tarts.
4
The food are great, no regrets going back there again for our anniversary. Variety of food is splendid.
4
Good variety of international and Asian cuisine
Their nonya desserts are awesome too
Service is a bit slow as they may be under staffed
4
Quite a good choice of varieties of food. Delicious. Quite an enjoyable meal with my wife. Will recommend to my relatives.
3
Had lunch here while staying at the attached Swissotel Merchant Court hotel. The items were ok but nothing truly exceptional. Especially considering the high prices. Better options right outside along Clarke Quay.
5
Excellent service by the staff who are attentive and very helpful. Very happy with the service. The dessert and western selection is good.
4
Food was sumptuous and the spread was good
Dessert is especially fulfilling
Will definitely visit again when there is 1-1 deals
4
Came here as a family celebrating Mother's Day and one obvious plus point is the abundance of space between tables. Unlike some establishments, they do not try to fit more tables in order to seat more patrons at the expense of the comfort of the diners. Food wise, really not bad. There were crabs, crawfish
4
Had a blast there for the Mother's Day Brunch Special. Great foie gras, Buddha jumped over the wall, and sweet sweet crabs! Ample food, no worry for food running out. My favorite was the beef brisket handmade noodles, with Sichuan chili!Was having difficulty looking for food for my son. But the chef made him garlic butter pasta. My small eater downed almost the entire plate. The chef also helped us scoop ice-cream. My son has fun putting all the choc bits and colorful candy flakes on top.All the food is very fresh. We definitely utterly enjoy ourselves to the full (stomach)
3
I am giving this restaurant a good rating (not average nor very good). Been there few years back. Love the newly renovated look, bright and white. This place is good for parties and gatherings. Spacious tables arrangement. Kueh Pie Ti shell was good. Very fresh and crispy. Let's say the cakes were better than the kuehs (so very hard) which came as a huge surprise as Ellenborough Market Cafe is being marketed as a Peranakan restaurant and Peranakans are known to make good kuehs. Durian pengat was as before good. I had a huge bowl. I love the mango prawns salad too. But seriously at $80 after taxes, there are really better options out there
5
Had an absolutely delightful time at the Cafe. The selection of food was great and the stff were friendly. Highly recommended.
2
Some crayfish are not very fresh. There is fly at the food. However the prawn and cha kuey tiao is nice.
3
With promotion of 1 for 1 then it's quite value for money , however for $80 per pax , you have other better option .
Alaskan crab leg is big salty n not so sweet .
1
Chicken is bloody literally as under cooked. Duck is stale. A fly landed on cake dessert on the buffet bar. The service staff simply removed the fly using her hand and left the dessert for guests to continue to take. Terrible food and hygiene.
4
Nice ambience, Kids friendly, not much seafood but fresh.
Location is ideal, very friendly staffs. Worth !
5
nice restaurant to visit, a bit pricey for high tea but lot of variety. 2 hours of complimentary parking free make it value added.
3
Food was forgettable, nothing to shout about and in fact, some dishes were cold and bland. Ambience however was lovely with nice oriental touches.
3
Liked the buffet selection but wished there was more choices for Peranakan food. The durian mousse was good though. Service was good and friendly.
5
Great place to go especially if you have friends with varied taste buds. The spread is sure to satiate any palate. The durian dessert is out of this world and you could concoct a dish out of the other garnishings there. The keuh dada that is freshly made live is also about the best available in Singapore, both the wrap and the coconut filling. Without fail, the 3 times I have been there, all my friends are fully satisfied.
5
Can only speak to the breakfast buffet here which we included in our hotel package. We were very happy and satisfied with the food and service. We were always welcomed congenially at the door and shown to a lovely table and immediately asked whether we would like a pot of tea or coffee and hot chocolate for my 10yo. The buffet was VERY extensive given this was only brekky! One area had everything including cold cereal, bircher muesli, fresh fruit, cold cuts and a selection of juices. The next zone had bacon (crispy or soft), baked beans, chicken sausages, beef sausages or pork and cheese, grilled tomato, wedges or hash browns , etc. the next was a variety of breads for toasting, fresh Danish pastries and croissants, a cheese board, an egg station (omelettes or fried made to order by Colin and staff), French toast, pancakes and waffles with a selection of toppings and syrups. There was also a refrigerated cabinet with a selection of yogurts in little glass jars. Next was the Asian breakfast buffet with steamed dumplings (including scallops!), scrambled eggs, plain congee or crab porridge, otek otek, noodle soups cooked to order and a selection of items such as fish fingers, spicy fried chicken drumettes, veg spring rolls, etc. Not only was this a great start to our day each morning but it also lined our tummies enough that we didn't need to eat again until mid to late afternoon. From the cafe we could easily go back to our room to finish preparing for the day, head back to concierge for help or just go straight out the front doors to the riverwalk and Clarke Quay with handy access to the MRT. Would not hesitate to add the Ellenborough breakfast to our package at our next stay.
5
I loved the cny buffet selection!
There were braised dried oysters, roast meats, YuSheng and the usual sashimi and Peranakan fare.
5
Fantastic breakfast buffet and hand made noodles fresh every night, that you can watch being made. Simply great.
4
Overall everything is very good except the sushi rolls they did not use the japanese rices, one bite, then rice was hard, gritty and not season properly.
4
For the price you paid, you get a huge selection of Peranakan food and their most famous durian dessert.
4
Revisit after some time. It has since been renovated with turquoise theme. Good selection of food and has a Nonya theme. It was good. Durian paste is still in the menu.
2
We were having breakfast at this place on the 19th of February 2017. The spread was okay. Nothing special. Couldn't complain even its very standard. However, the service was far from standard. The waitresses not competent to do something (which supposedly standard, like taking the dirty plates out of the table) unless we insist and they seemed to try to get somebody else to do it for them. What a restaurant
5
Went to Ellenborough Market Caf√É¬© for dinner yesterday, my 8th visit and I would still rate them very good. Wide range of food for both warm and cold dishes. If you are new to Peranakan food, this restaurant will be a good start as you can try a little bit of everything and work out the dishes that suits your palate
4
I was going to give this place a 5 star review, but after today's experience, I would rate this place as mediocre. Most of the food is great though. This is a good place to go to if you want a taste of the hybridised culture of Singapore. The cuisine focuses on local delicacies and Peranakan food, while including a few non-local dishes. The desserts are a mix of local and non-local. On the whole, the local food is well done. Nevertheless, the soup served today was lukewarm (it wasn't the last time). The service is efficient in the sense that they clear the plates promptly. However, I did not get a tea refill since I got my first cup of tea. Maybe I should have opted for plain water instead (because they get refilled more often). The plate I got was stained. The interior decor is definitely well done and is welcoming. They managed to give this place a modern appeal while incorporating Peranakan elements in the design.On the whole, most of the food tastes good but I think they were just overwhelmed by the sheer amount of people today. Do brace yourself for inconsistencies at this place.
3
We had dinner there while we were staying at the hotel. The buffet had sashimi, prawns and bugs and other typical buffet food. There was also a selection of local and Malay-Chinese food. Some of the meat was overcooked but most of the food were fresh and pretty good. Nothing really stood out as impressively fantastic, but a decent family style buffet
4
exciting and wide range of food. totally love it. the service was very polite but I do not like the way customers are put very near each other despite the restaurant being pleasantly empty. When I asked for a table further away, I was told that these tables were reserved but no one turned up for the whole duration that we were there
4
Was looking for buffet promotion and came across Chope app to book. Visit and food was pleasant and will definitely go back again!
5
The durian dessert was very good and we enjoyed the variety of peranakan food. We were seated immediately and the plated were changed regularly.
3
If you like your local/Peranakan food this is perhaps the buffet for you. The selection was a little limited though and sadly there were only a few standout dishes for us. Overall this would not be my first choice for Asian cuisine.
4
The newly renovated restaurant gives a nice ambience for gathering of big group of friends. A big round table can accommodate 8 comfortably and facilitates chit chat. High ceiling reduces noise level. Great place.
4
Just visited Ellenborough Cafe after the revamp and while the buffet area appears to be more spread out, the spread itself appears to have shrunk.
Quality was still pretty consistent though and that is still one of the high points.
3
Not much variety as compared to an international buffet so we got bored of the food pretty quickly, but the food quality was great. Recommended for elderly or families. Serves only coffee/tea/water, other drinks are subjected to extra charges.

Firstly, for me to pen down my thoughts in the midst of dinner could only mean that it is so evident and clear that the team in Ellenborough did exceptionally well. I have been dining at Swissotel and Raffles as an Amex diner since it's inception and to be frank dining at Ellenborough has been nothing but downhills and disappointment as my historical reviews on Tripadviser as shown. Service was previously sloppy, slow, aloof, nonchalant and also food was mediocre as I have recalled vividly bringing this to your kind attention almost a year ago. Even when Mr Raju offered to straighten the path, it seemed a downhill process as there were way too many lapses hence my absence from Ellenborough over the past.But with my family visiting Singapore I have decided to give Ellenborough a second chance. And I was well received and handled with such care and attention from your outlet manager itself that my entire reservation process was seamless! His attention to details, leadership and ownership and handling specific requests were handled with poise and professionalism that it was hard to find a better Manager. On our arrival, I was met by Steven himself and was surprise to find a familiar face, who was previously the manager at Sheraton Towers The Dining Room! I am not surprised that Swissotel has managed to steal this asset from Sheraton and he was indeed a staff that was memorable and also personable! During my visit to Sheraton, Steven exuded the same kind of professionalism and warmth but equally impressive was his leadership by example! While many managers would probably rest on their laurels and in fact take a back seat and just simply provided instructions. Steven seemed to exude a different form of leadership, which is by example! He can be seen ushering guests, clearing tables and engaging guests which is a rare sight for someone holding a managerial position. And I dare say that this is where his staff and subordinates take the que, they work efficiently and quickly with finesse and such level of professionalism that it almost seems you are in a fine dining restaurant. Etiquette such as the sequence of pouring wine, refilling of water glasses, personalised finger bowls, and even niceties when clearing plates are extended. Steven and his team in Ellenborough have set an extremely high standard in terms of service delivery across all F&B outlets in all restaurants in Singapore. Because the most important in any form of organization is the ability to set standards and follow them, it is clearly evident that the management of Swissotel Merchant Court has transmitted strong values and thus reinforcement has trickled down to the entire management team and all associates. And while the dining options in Singapore remain varied and many, I am confident to say that Ellenborough has earned my undivided loyalty. This is thanks to an excellent management team, fantastic team work and a hardworking and well trained team in Ellenborough! I sincerely hope that this serves as a reminder to all the staff in Ellenborough that service begins with you, and that you do indeed make a difference. By propelling yourself forward in terms of providing great service, you delight guests, and with that repeat customers and in turn increase in revenue and expansion and promotions. Conversely, the similar negative service attitude will bring about the downfall of the company and ultimately yourself! Hence, with this i congratulate your team once again on a job well done and also on the side note my compliments to the Chef for the increase in culinary delights compared to the past, especially the durian desserts
3
Supposed to be Peranakan cuisine, but the selection seems to be very limited.There was of course the sashimi/seafood/oyster corner. Alittle Chinese cuisine. And a small selection of Peranakan Cuisine.I don't feel like its a Peranakan cuisine at all, and i feel alittle disappointed to be honest.The durian mousse taste okay, but not the best i have tasted. If you want to have a real peranakan cuisine, it would be better to bring your money and visit a real peranakan restaurant, and have a full fledge meal
4
Took my family there to celebrate my eldest daughter's birthday. The renovated restaurant was bright, modern and nice. The stir-fried clay fish and chili crab were tasty though messy to eat. We went for the cold salmon, oysters and snow crab. My girls like the Chines and Western dessert. Overall, the buffet dinner was pretty good though would be a little pricey without the credit card promotion

4
Nice ambience after the renovation. Food is quite tasty except that refill for sashimi took longer time. Variety of dessert is good and the chocolate cake is yummy! Service staff need to improve their attentiveness. Will visit only with credit card promotion.
4
Good mix of Peranakan food. The durian mousse used to be better - nowadays, more flour than durian shreds in the mixture.
4
Those who favor peranakan food will not be disappointed. The high tea serves a wide range of nonya desserts. The popular durian paste is definitely for the durian lovers. This cafe is my favorite buffet venue. Value for money :)
5
Wonderful food, had good crayfish and had good durian local food. enjoyed ourselves. the new restaurant that has been renovated looks good now!
5
Always lovedl the food at Ellenborough Market as it offers fresh and delicious local and international delights. Space between individual tables are spread out that makes walking much easier.
5
Enjoyed the lunch buffet. Good service and tasty food. Good spread of food. Their lobster is a must try ! Outdoor dining overlooks the Singapore river. Complementary parking available
4
The range food is wide & different from most hotel buffets. The fried carrot cake, crayfish, salmon sashimi, durian peggat & other desserts are nice. Worth for the credit card promo $80++ for 2pax, not worth for normal rate of $160/2pax. Bring your hsbc or amex platinum card
3
Haven't been here in years. They renovated the place. Went for the Saturday lunch buffet at $58++ per head. Half peranakan, part international (japanese) and part local fare. For that price, a lot of cheap food were served. Expensive items were the crayfish, sea bass, 2 types of sashimi and cold seafood only. Selection in general was not very wide. Pay special attention to their durian pengat which is their specialty and kueh dadar. I had 50% off (far card membership). Would not have patronised if not for the discount
3
This restaurant is newly renovated. this is my 2nd visit. the first time, we were seated near the entrance beside a fountain facing a non descript unadorned pale blue wall. That unattractive area of seating remains unchanged. This time, we were given a table overlooking the Singapore river, with a lovely view outside. The main offering here is their peranakan (fusion malay-chinese) buffet. But since none of us are fond of such food, we opted for ala carte. Many of the foreign servers look decidedly new and unsure when asked about the dishes, but seemed eager to please. While the food was good, the one hour wait was not. The hotel provides 2hour complimentary parking to diners. But with less than an hour left of parking time to consume the food and pay the bill, it was not possible to exit the car park within 2hours. The hotel should increase their efficiency or increase the free parking to 3 hours
5
The staff are very observant and caring. Give us a table near the buffet table but we feel it might be too cramp so we want to change. He explained why and said that the other table would be far away from the buffet table. We said ok, as my sister taking the foods for me, I just sit. Definitely we would come back - we loved the buah kelak and durian pengnet. Al the seafoods were fresh
5
They have just relaunched their restaurant and they continue to serve great peranakan food. It is a notch above the usual generic buffets. Great food and great service.
5
good food, good services, friendly staff, the durian pengat was very nice , will go again. only thing it the food always runs out all the time
4
Spacious, good for big group as they have long table. Food variety is good with cold dishes, Peranakan cuisine, Asian and many desserts to choose. My group of 18 enjoyed very much.
4
While the price is a little high, there is variety of food: sushi, local favourites and paranakan desserts. U can sit by the windows and enjoy the view of Clarke Quay. Al fresco dining is also available.

I say disappointing because the last time we were there - before the renovation - the food was great and there were queues of people waiting for tables. Our recent dinner was a mediocre buffet at best. The restaurant used to be popular for its Peranakan buffet but now they offer a mishmash of East and West and definitely master of none. The Penang Laksa gravy was lukewarm and lacked oomph. The chapchye was pathetic with only cabbage, a few bits of carrots (for colour?) and a few strands of soyabean strips. There wasn't even fresh chili belachan to accompany the local Nonya dishes.The chilled crab claws were tasteless while there was hardly any "meat" in the butter crab and the crayfish was soft i.e. not particularly fresh. The saving grace was surprising the roast beef and mash potatoes, though our appetites were still hankering for more Nonya dishes that we came for but were denied. There were only four varieties offered plus a few chili vegetable salads.The dessert offerings were generous which included a huge pot of durian which went well with the bubor terigu. Other than that, the nonya kuehs looked better than they tasted. The filling in the (freshly made) kueh dadar was paltry and the cheesecake inedible. The apple strudel was so-so. The safest recommended sweet would be the ice cream! At $62++ a head - and even with our credit card discount of $80++ for two - we felt it was really not worth our while nor our appetites. Without a doubt there was quantity, but for sure the quality was missing.Service was good with the plates efficiently cleared in good time. We felt the new decor was cold as compared to previous place. It seems a lot bigger but maybe because the place was half empty. No guessing why! Oh yes, they offered a parking coupon - but for only the first 2 hours. Sigh....
1
This was my 1st time back since they completed their renovation. Was very very disappointed in the quality of the food. The first few rounds of fried kway teow was hard and undercooked before they changed to a different type of kway teow. The quality of the rest of the food was under par. As a far card member, I had 50% and even with the discount, I felt it was totally not worth! The only good thing is that they offer 2 hours complimentary parking
2
Went there tonite with my family, mum, sister and her family. We have an American Express voucher which gave a discount of 50% on the price of the buffet dinner. A wide spread of food but not of the best quality and flavour but the peranakan curry laksa and acar were the best dishes for me. Also quite good was the durian pinget, with a nice and distinctive flavour of Musang King and perhaps some D24. A decent spread of cheeses too. Slipper Lobsters would have been better if cooked in garlic butter sauce instead of black beans. Beef brisket, duck braised with yam, steamed fish, curry prawns, seafood omelette were at best pedestrian. The cooked peranakan dishes do not look appetising and I did not try any of them except the pork ponteh. Gravy seems a bit too thick and saltish and the pork despite being a piece from the belly, was tough and devoid of flavours. The cold seafood spread also did not look appetising although the cold cooked prawns were fresh. If not for the discount, I find it not necessarily good value for money. If only the cooking can be better. But the service was excellent and managed to salvage the evening for me.

Had a dinner in ellenbourough after reading good reviews on this restaurant. The hotel is still undergoing renovation but the restaurant has been completed. Food selection is pretty good. Crayfish is delicious, curry prawns is ok. Chili crab is above average for hotel standard. Pumpkin soup is delicious and is a must try. Personally, the perankan selection is pretty normal. Ice cream selection from Movenpick is good!! The only thing that needs improvement will be the coffee as we were initially served a cup of tasteless brown water and upon feedback to the manager, we were given a complimentary cup of coffee freshly brewed
3
Came here together with my family in a group of 10. Restaurant was refreshed, but there wasn't much crowd. The new renovated restaurant did gave an uplift of the atmosphere. Food wise, I think more needs to be done. So far, we enjoyed the laksa, the sashimi, the sushi and the cold prawns. The rest of the items would need improvement. For example, the fried food items (eg the fired chicken, the yam and mango roll, the spring roll, the tempura) were dry, the Portuguese egg tarts and the baked Char Siew Pastry were not flaky enough, the Kuehs were hard and dry, the kueh pieti shells were hard and also not crispy. The price has gone up considerably but the food has to match up. The parking fee is also exorbitantly expensive. It really makes you think twice about a revisit.
5
Great service ,staff are quick to seat you and get tea, coffee etc, great selection of food for all tastes .

Ellenborough Market Cafe went for renovation earlier this year, and reopened in July. The decor is nice, and it is more spacious than before.Food is of the same good quality as before. I think there are more choices, now more spread out in the restaurant. Overall feel is less congestion and more space to move around.There are several must try dishes in the hi tea. Durian pengnyat is definitely one. The second to try is their porridge - smooth, contains a lot of ingredients and without MSG feel. Only thing is the youtiao is not as crunchy as I would like.Desserts are a must try. A whole lot of desserts from asian to western to try, like cakes, kueh, tarts, soups. Likewise, the laksa is another must try. Mango and yam rolls are nice and crunchy.All in, a must try for buffet lovers
5
Although the restaurant went through a facelift, I must say that the quality of food remains just as good. The durian paste now comes in small packages but the quantity is of the right portion. Many may not get use to the the new layout but I assure you that nothing is lacking ... Just more classic in the way food is displayed. Worth the money. I'll be back !!

EMCafe used to be a favorite of mine for many years. I liked the dark decor. Nevertheless I eagerly awaited it's reopening after several months of refurbishing. I went for their $52++ lunch buffet earlier this month. The food variety has increased. So that is a plus. There is still quite a lot of Peranakan style food. However, nothing seemed particularly delicious which would entice me to return soon. The new decor is much lighter and brighter. Pleasant. But I didn't mind the old.I now realize that one of the plus points of the old EMCafe was its price/quality ratio. If I recall correctly, lunch was $38++. Somehow, $52++ seems so much more expensive for what we are getting. It's something like a 36% increase! Merchant Court Hotel is surely not a 5 star hotel. But $52++ surely must be a 5 star price! And half the lobby is still under renovation hoardings! Not a classy feeling at all!Will I return? Only very slowly
4
First visit after the renovation. Whole place looks brighter and more welcoming. Quality of food for buffet is good and nice selection of peranankan food. Highly recommended for casual gathering with friends. Will be back
2
Before the renovations, there were a large variaty of food. Thus, was eagerly waiting to try fter the reno. Went last Friday at dinner time with some friends. I was quite diispointed with the decreased in the variety of food choices. Food was on the hogh end of average to be fair.However, this does not make up for loss in choices.
5
We were there for the Lunch Buffet, highly recommended by Brandon Chia to visit after the refurbishment of the cafe. We were indeed intrigued by the decor and of course the good quality/variety of food & beverage.My wife and I really enjoyed every moment especially the service rendered by Steven, Lyn, Edriana and Erin were warmth yet not too intimidating.We will definitely recommend this cafe to our friends and colleagues for gatherings and company's get-together
2
Eagerly anticipating their re-opening, I finally got to dine there again a week ago with a friend, didnt even ask about the price.Setup was refreshing and food selection still starts from just after the receptionist but it hugs along the walls in one direction leading to the main dining area. There was 2 live stations when I was there: Mee Siam & some bread puddings.Overall, the variety has reduced slightly but quality has definitely dropped many notches. Also at $52++ compared to $38++ before renovation, I will not be back anymore.2 choices of soup then: Hot & Spicy a la SzeChuan style and Clam Chowder. The hot & spicy soup was really quite bland, the sour part from the vinegar was weak and the complimenting spice was missing too. Clam Chowder was worse: it was nothing more than potato and carrot in milk! Hardly any seafood nor clam taste in the entire mixture!Carpark redemption is only for the first 2 hours and if you reach early, you get penalised big time: $4.50 for first hour
3
So the range of food was very good - wide selection of local food including laksa; nonya cakes etc; sashimi and sushi; western cakes etc. Drinks were limited - only tea and coffee - so things like latte have extra costs but they also had things like lemonade etc. Some of the quality of the food was not so good though e.g.filled crab is dry; otah is dry. Some of the food is good e.g. carrot cake. Parking for the hotel is very expensive
5
A variety of foods Western and Asian. Eat as much as you like and you can drink tea/coffee and a variety of fresh fruit and fresh fruit juices. Pastries galore have a big breakfast and that will do you all day
5
The Market Caf√© is excellent, offering a variety of food for both the Western and Asian pallat. There are various theme months offering specialities that are both appealing and delicious. Staff are friendly helpful and proficient. Open for breakfast,, lunch, dinner
5
Lots of choices in this buffet style cafe. Staff were very friendly and kept the coffee flowing! Loved the choice of hot and cold options.
1
sometime, as hotel .. do spend time and upgrade instead of giving false information .. there is nothing to enjoy with the hotel bill one pai
5
good food, service up to mark , durian pengat was supeb! but the restaurant need to revamp, service staff was very attentive and provide good service
5
This is where breakfast is taken when resident in the Hotel and open to non residents in the evening.Has a varied choice of eastern and european choices
2
Ambience was nice and tables placed far enough apart to not feel boxed in. Service was good with very attentive staff that cleared plates and filled cups pretty quick but that's all the positive side of this dining experience. Steamed cold prawns, yabbies and spanner crabs didn't smell fresh enough and if your seafood isn't fresh you shouldn't steam it and serve without sauces. The prawns were decent enough but the rest didn't smell tantalizing at all and were actually borderline bad. Moving on to the mains, nonya food is far from what was served. Braised pork lacked flavor, kueh pie tie filling was also...yes...lacking... Chap chye was plain and tasted just like what seems to be the only ingredient, cabbage. The only saving grace for the nonya food was the sambal belachan. Dessert selection was plentiful but, then again, lacking in flavor and texture. Eclair was filled with watery filling which squished with every bite. The cakes was, nothing surprising, also lacking. The only 2 desserts that were decent enough in texture and flavor were the pulot hitam and durian pengat. Logistics was also not good. The walk from hotel lobby to the dining place was under construction at some areas and wasn't presentable at all for a named hotel. Also, washroom area had to be accessed via another door which you had to pull open. Not good when you're heading there to wash your hands.To not end on a sour note. One final plus is that the restaurant back door opens up to the riverside area where you can go for a post dinner stroll and look at all the other eateries you should be picking over this place

We did a late booking through Amex Reserve Concierge Service on 26th Dec, most restaurants were fully booked And we had 12 pax to cater. Ellenborough came through , even though they said only outdoor seating , we eventually were seated inside (Aircon) There was a good spread of Asian cuisine including Indian Rojak (rare) and Mee-goreng (reminds me of famous ponggol version) and all the traditional Nonya Kueh were superb. The usual super dishes were a major draw .. Like Braised Crayfish and Steamed Fish, all "wipe out" within 2-3 mins of coming out of the kitchen. This cuisine is only till end of the month, so hurry
4
Our family of 8 dined here for dinner tonight and the service was fantastic - very attentive yet without staff hovering around.Foodwise, they were serving a mix of Christmas dishes (think turkey and honey baked ham), as well as some Peranakan, Japanese and Indian dishes. Generally, the food was of a high standard and the prawns and crayfish were especially fresh.I enjoyed the Indian style fried chicken, which was moist on the inside, as well as the carrot cake and shepherd's pie. I am not a huge durian fan, but I also went for a bowl of the justifiably good during pengat, as well as nonya kueh like kueh dada, bubur cha cha and Christmas fruit cake.Prices are on the high side (around S$75 +++ per head) but it was worth it for the relatively wide variety and the high quality of food and service
5
Love this market cafe have our breakfast there every day when staying at merchant court . Sat outside by river can't beat it just hoping they keep it when all the renovations are done . Would not be the same without it. Lovely place also to have evening meal lovely buffe
2
our department booked for 30 people for lunch. it wasnt crowded . food choices is limited. seafood is so bland. we heard durian is heavenly here but came out as ordinary as well. i appreciate so much the cream brulee and the sago. they taste good! if you ask me if i want to come back here again, the answer is NO.
5
Excellent buffet breakfast, plenty of choice and great fresh quality. I loved that the chef was cooking eggs anyway you like while you wait. Great ambience as well.
4
Celebrated my birthday on 6th aug with my partner. The service staff was very attentive. Plates and drinks were cleared and refilled promptly.
Like that they are still serving a whole fish all these years.
Also their thick durian penget.
4
Convenience restaurant located near Clarke Quay mrt station. I have tried the lunch buffet and surprisely the food is good and there are lots of dessert including Nonya kueh. Their durian pengat is the most popular dessert and it taste really good.
4
This is my 3rd visit in last 2 month for buffet lunch. The service is good and the staff is attentive and clear the plates fast. But food that served this month was not fantastic as compare to previous month. Nevertheless we had enjoyed the fresh prawn, sashimi, Hong Kong style steamed fish and braise duck which are nice. Their durian penget is the best and you would love to have more

I decided to revisit EMC after an absence of 2 years or so (due to bad experience previously, i had stopped going to this place). And this is due to the heritage promotion that promises durians and other local fares like chili crabs and laksa. Saw a lot of people feasting on the fresh durians collected from an outdoor stall ( that resembles those like a streetside stall... interesting concept). But i took my time to try on the other hot dishes first. At 7-ish, i went to queue up like the rest of the diners... but by 730.. they announced that durians were out and i was bestowed the last plate, of which the durian wasn't fresh either. Manager promised the crowd ( who obviously came for the durians that he will source for more and deliver then table by table). By 930pm, no durians were sent. As such, i paid extra for a buffet, that still serves normal food, and failed to deliver their Heritage promotion. The only change positive experience came from the staff members (not manager but servers). Prompt, polite and attentive. Swissotel has been on a major slide, from rooms... to dining ... to staff attitude. Guess now, with better staff members, they should work on the basics to regain the well deserved 5* image and reputation. For now, 3.5 * at best.
4
Went with my friends (group of 6) on a Friday night, reaching at about 6.45pm.At this point of the season they even have a small counter offering Durians (middle-range hybrid) in small plates for diners to enjoy.There is also a good mix of peranakan dishes and international favorites like some Sushi and seafood. The local desserts (hot) range was impressive. In all, it was a very good and satisfying dinner, even among the small group of us who were quite picky about the food that we eat.If there is any minor blip, I will think there is not enough variety of cold drinks on offer. (Only 3 or 4?). This restaurant is definitely recommended for anyone who wish to enjoy a good local buffet dinner with wide range of dishes: Satay, fried rice, durian-inspired dishes and others.Dinner set us back by about $80 nett per person, includng taxes. Still quite good value, considering what you are getting.Cheers
4
we went there to celebrate Father's Day. the place seems big enough to accommodate crowds. we really enjoyed the seafood, the Peranakan dishes and local desserts and kueh. there is also an outdoor corner with satay and other noodles. the sashimi was so so as there was only salmon available. the staff were attentive and diligent in clearing our plates. buffet prices a little pricey. we went on a sunday night and it costs S$60++ per person.once we were done, there was also a photo booth outside the cafe where we could take photos with Dad! Happy Father's Day :
4
Restaurant is near Clark Quay train station and close to the Singapore River, which provides a good venue for a relaxing walk after our meal.There is quite a good selection of food which include Japanese, Peranakan & Chinese. Tried the Peranakan duck but was disappointed - the duck is too tough.Most of us loved the clay fish and durian dessert
4
We stayed at the hotel and had buffet breakfast there every morning and the buffet dinner once. There is great choice of food. Breakfast included eggs cooked to your liking, pancakes, waffles, french toast, as well as plenty of cereals, breads, pastries & fresh fruit.Dinner also had plenty of choices with sushi & sashimi and other cold seafood (prawns, crab, mussels, baby lobster) as well as hot seafood (stir-fried lobster) & fish; but also other dishes such as pork ribs, chicken, noodles etc. Good choice of desserts, incl fresh fruit.The service was good, with plates being cleared quickly and clean cutlery provided.It can get quite busy and a little crowded, so certainly not the setting for an intimate dinner, however if you eat outside it is not only much quieter but you also get to overlook the Singapore River and the rest of Clarke Quay.It is not a cheap meal, but not overly expensive in comparison to other restaurants in Singapore
1
Food is average, but the kitchen is unable to dish out food fast enough to meet demand. 15 to 20 mins to replace the fish, and longer for the sushi. You really have to eat real slow to keep pace with the kitchen, and keep staring at the food sections so that you are the 1st in the queue to get to the food. If not, you will have to wait for another 20 mins...
5
I love the seafood buffet specially the sushi. They are so fresh and delicious! Staff are friendly and the restaurant is clean! Will sure come back next time we are back in Singapore.
3
Great spot close to river for snacks or dinner. Do not ask for icecream as the icy nature is not pleasant to the mouth. Service is somewhat disinterested. Range of food at the buffet for dinner is very good without being sensational.
4
There are lots of varieties of food and dessert. International food including Seafood and super yummy durian.
The desserts are nice and similar to those you can get form the five stars hotels in Hong Kong.
However, they do not have ice-cream.
5
Great selection of food at the breakfast buffet.
Beautiful location.
We sat and enjoyed our breakfast outside.
Highly recommended
3
The food selection was miserably little, and there are not much choices. Food replenishment was slow too..

I endorse much of what Rebecca388 has mentioned in her review earlier. Hence I come from another way to share my experience. Do pardon me for the cold humor below in my description of my birthday dinner here on Friday night, 8 May 2015.Buffet spread - I don't understand the buffet theme. Already confused by their spread of Peranakan food, mixed with seafood servings that you have to walk around to look for them.... Oh wait! Maybe that's the cafe's way of getting you to digest your food as you go for additional helpings. Sadly, it didn't help me as I lost my appetite after all the walking. The saving grace for me were the durian pengat, salmon sashimi, and the good ol' watermelon in its simplest presentation. Service staff that do tai chi to your request - called the attention of a male waiter, asking for servings of water ten minutes into our first plates of food. Instead, he turned around and called another waitress to do it! Amazing! A cashier that tells me my daughter should be older - I could have sworn I remembered my daughter's birth year when I stepped into the cafe. Strangely, while settling the bill, my family was told that my daughter couldn't be a toddler. Instead, she looked four years old to them at EMC. Hence they have to charge her for the buffet. That got me to think, "Did my daughter go thru a growth spurt in the last 2 hours during the buffet?" Or "When you use a baby chair at EMC, your child's age is automatically four years old, which means the buffet is chargeable!" Neither question made sense to us, and naturally we declined and explained the real age of the child to them. In any case, if you have a child eating with you at EMC from age five and below, do consider bringing his/her birth certificate to the cafe for their staff verification. Then again, they may still say your child is four years old.Sighs - EMC, I saw you in your heydays a few years ago. Sad to say, you have fallen from your heights. What's more, you are a part of swissotel! The food and service my family got is no different than eating in some buffet set up in the heartlands. Hope that you will awake from your slumber and one day return to your former glory

Have not been here for quite awhile and was glad to see that the place is still doing pretty well.Lots of tables for big groups and many seemed to be regulars.We had made a reservation for 1pm but was there at 12pm instead. They were able to allow us in but we found it odd that they seated us at a table for 5 when there were only 2 of us. Someone must have realized it later and they split the 2 tables into a table for 2 and another for 3. This is more like it.Interesting array of food. If you love Peranakan food or would like to try some, this is a good place to visit. Today there was pie tee, little crispy shells where you put some vegetable filling in. At the Peranakan corner, there is also the nangka lemak (coconut jackfruit), item sio (duck), buah keluak, etc...Then there is the usual cold prawns, mussels and crayfish. Today they had Mee Siam instead of laksa, both traditional dishes. Desserts were our favourite. Whenever we are here, we will go for the durian pengat (durian blended with coconut milk), something that some may steer far from. Interestingly, they had muah chee (glutinous rice dough coated with ground peanut and sugar) which seems to be difficult to find. Various other traditional desserts like bubuh terigu, black sesame paste, cheng teng, etc... were at the buffet section too
3
This place is suitable for big group gatherings, since there's ample seating. Restaurant was half full on a week night dinner.It is strange that food is laid out over three different locations, same distance apart.When we were directed to our table at the inner part of the restaurant, we have initially missed the seafood and Peranakan sections which were located at a different part of the restaurant.Main section of the buffet included cooked dishes like vegetable (kailan), cooked prawns, fish, mutton, black pepper crayfish and paper-wrapped chicken. There's a salad bar, two different types of soup and a limited choice of bread. Sashimi and some sushi? (did not get to try the sushi which was gone and not replenished). There's also fried laksa, which was too spicy for many of us, chicken karaage and a few other tempura\fried items. Dessert included the 'famous' durian pengat, fresh fruits, cakes and a few types of chinese dessert (chengtng, green bean soup, white fungus soup and a few others which i cannot identify). For me, these dessert soups and also the muah chee were not fantastic. Maybe it is time for a menu change. We were disappointed that there were no ice cream in this buffet.The Peranakan section is disappointing; and we did not try any of the 6 items except for the kueh pie tee, the filling of which was a bit too salty.Seafood spread included crabs, prawns and mussels. The prawns and crabs were quite fresh.Hot beverages (tea and coffee) are included in the buffet.Overall, the dinner buffet @ $48++ was average.Service staff was polite and attentive. However, the service of the reservation desk needs improvement

I really liked the Asian decor/ambience of this Cafe. And the HUGE Variety of Food Choices, including Western AND Asian, really made Breakfast a delightful meal. Yes, it is Busy...but there never seemed a problem with getting a nice table...or getting one's eggs freshly cooked. The 'servers' were always looking out for changing the plates or offering more coffee or tea. A very pleasant start to my 4 day stay. Thank you!
4
We had breakfast here daily and I was pleased to have access to gluten free cereal and gluten free bread. There appeared to be plenty to choose from at the buffet. The a la carte menu needs expanding, especially the Asian section. Why travel this far to order western food
4
A must try is their famous Durain fruit desert, fresh prawns and crayfish dishes are usually quick to finished so do take it early before they are gone. For those who prefer Alfresco dining, there is a outdoor seating(smoking is not advise)
5
Good for sitting outside and people watching . Excellent food , the evening buffet is particularly good , especially if you like lobster in copious quantities.
4
The most expensive Fish and Chips ever eaten - ¬£23 approx.
Breakfast menu is brilliant. Staff are excellent, nothing appears to be too much trouble. Would recommend in the future although only if Breakfast is paid for as part of the booking.
4
Open early and really the only thing around the area for breakfast! And the coffee is good, too. Extensive continential, full or asian style and egg chef.
4
from sushi to fresh prawn are there, and a must try durian pengat, not a big fan of durian, but here, still want more after 2nd refill.
service are excellent from waitress and chef, also all the food a fresh prepare ( lunch time ).
5
The chicken slice porridge is particular spectacular. Bacon, salmon, omelette and the dimsum was all fresh and nicely cooked.

I had not been to the Ellenborough market cafe in three years so this was the test of time to see if is as good as I remember, and it was! Saturday night was busy and all the inside tables were reserved so we had to sit outside. I was wondering if the weather would be too hot to enjoy our dinner but it was not. THis was the first time to dine outside and it more enjoyable than I had anticipated. We arrived ten minutes before opening and were seated right at 6:30 so we could enjoy the first pickings. Because we were waiting for other family to arrive we decided to wait. When we did finally start in the place was getting full and so many people already digging in. My favorite is the BBQ slipper lobster or crayfish, but they had the black bean version instead which turned out to be just as tasty. So many dishes to enjoy and my waste-line showed it. I learned once again that people lose their manners when it comes to buffet in Singapore, like people filling two large plates of the lobster leaving others to wait for the kitchen staff to bring more. I would like to personally tell Singaporeans whom like to be selfish and gluttonous that you disgrace your people by doing so. So sad!  I enjoyed all the delights of the evening and will make another return visit, not just because of the food but because of the friendly staff. Our table was attended to by Anba and another lady which I didn't get her name. Anba was very courteous and helpful the whole evening and that added to the enjoyment for all. Overall I give two thumbs up for a job well done by the serving staff, thank you for contributing to the success of the birthday celebration for Isaac! Bravo! I hope that my next visit will sooner than later but will have to wait for my waste line to shrink a bit before returning, ha ha

My family and i recently dined at Ellenborough Market Cafe (EMC) at Merchant Court Hotel at Clarke Quay. We used to frequent this place 7-8 years ago and the interior hasn't change a bit. Good for us since it added some nostalgic sentiments to the gathering but not so good if you are visiting for the first time as the restaurant might appear a little bit aged. EMC is famous among its regulars for its durian puree dessert and it certainly didn't disappoint - it is smooth, chilled and not too sweet, just the way durian lovers like them. The rest of the spread is quite good too especially when you consider the price tag of $48 per adult for a weeknight - i think that is a decent price. The seafood spread includes the usual suspects of chilled prawns and mussels but i thought many people, like myself, would be disappointed not to find fresh oysters and tuna sashimi. Ask to seat at the al fresco area if you are not travelling with young childen as the sight of the bustling clarke quay and the waterfront can be romantic at times. Overall, it was a pleasant return to Ellenborough Market Cafe
3
When there this afternoon with my family and a couple of friends for high tea. Reservations were made but we still have to queue up in the same line as the rest. So if those ahead of you didn't have a reservation you will be held up just the same. The restaurant opens at 3:30pm sharp for hi tea.Once seated you are free to roam around the buffet. The variety is not bad.. international, some sashimi etc. They offer lime juice, cranberry juice and bundong on the tap. Coffee and tea are served.The taste of the food is ok nothing to shout about. The waiters are waitresses are quite prompt. Food are replenished quite promptly. All in all the service is good and atmosphere is quite good.. not too noisy. The spaces between tables are good so you won't bump into others as you move around from your seat to the buffet.They charge $30 for adults and $15 for children above 4. Of course being in a hotel there's +++
3
Made a reservation for 10pax to celebrate a friend's birthday. The buffet spread is divided into 2 section. Seafood and nonya food at one area, while dessert, sashimi, cook food at another. It's not a hassle to move between the 2 food area, as we are seated in between these 2 section. Overall, I find the food serve is of more local fair than international cuisine. The durian pudding, which is a long time fav, is a tad too sweet. Sashimi are rather fresh and that is what I had most. While The rest of the food are so-so. Most memorable is the service rendered from the service crew. The are really polite and patience even though it was busy night. All our requests are taken care promptly, guess that's the highlight.Per head is about $58, after tax, rather expensive given that we did not order any alcohol/wine. Coffee and tea is inclusive
3
Ellenborough Market Cafe have not enough choices of food in buffet dinner. Though their seafood section and "Chilli "Crab" taste good but lack of pasta, meat, and dessert section. They are more on Singaporean local food but not enough International food choices.
3
My family and I had buffet dinner at this place and were disappointed by the food. The Penang Char Kway Teow was too oily, sticky and cold though it was supposed to be a stall style, the chilli crab was overcooked, the kueh pie tie fillings was bland and the salad range was limited.If you like braised pork nyonya style, this place served it ok but if its warmer, much better. There is unlimited flow of salmon sashimi, crayfishes in black pepper sauce (the sauce is awful, too strong) and the garoupa cooked in curry sauce was just not attractive at all.So overall, to pay that price is ok if you are hearty eater
5
A really good range of food choices, we loved the seafood buffet, no oysters but everything else, well presented and prepared, nothing ran out and no waiting in massive lines.Even tried the local Durian fruit, verdict: not a fan, but plenty of other options available
3
The location was located just beside Singapore river.Food was as average buffet but there's durian booth which we love it. The price was a little overpriced for the food. There is a small station for seafood and it was fresh, a small station of peranakan dishes that does not taste as good as expectation, and the rest as normal buffet will have - sashimi, Asian food, desserts only a few. Good service we enjoyed thoug
3
As a frequent stayer in the hotel i go to breakfast buffet regularly. Its not bad, but gone is the time where they had swiss cheese melted at sunday brunch. Now its only the normal basics. And the tiny juice glasses are ridiculous. You either have to get 3 at once or walk 3 times fir a reguar glass. Given the price they charge for breakfast, that should not be an issue
3
We're there for dinner with family, it was very crowded, which is good for the restaurant, but not us having great problem moving to the food area. Food served were not the usual high standard, and is not enough, people queuing and waiting for the waiter to bring out and immediately is empty.Most of the trays are visually empty, it shows there is not enough.i ll certainly avoid this place
3
Went for the dinner buffet. Place was decorated in a Chinese / Peranakan style. The special thing would be the serving of nonya food.Crab wasn't fresh. Only have 1 live station.Dessert serves durian ice kacang. You get to make your own ice kacang. There are selections of nonya kuehs too
5
I went there a few years back as there was the crab buffet, and they had the credit card promotion where 4 dine for the price of 3.The crab buffet selection was good, they had the black pepper, salted,steamed crabs available, but you must snatch it really quick because there are so many people waiting to get the pincers.I really loved the lobster (as they called it but I think it's more like crayfish), and it's always running out quick. Dessert range was okay, but the durian puree is to die for. It's so good that I had 3 servings.I also liked how they have chefs to cook noodles (eg laksa) for you on the spot! (:Buffet selection wasn't wide though. But I spent $50 per person (including taxes etc) and thought that it's really worth it. But currently I think prices have gone up
3
I been to many places for buffet but this is just average to me. Variety of food is limited and no drinks included in the buffet. Price is slightly higher relatively to the range and quality of food. Sadly to say, spotted cockroach in the restaurant which hotel should do more pest control on this
1
Went here for brunch at about 11am on a Friday morning. Several other diners sitting outside, some with food, some without. It's table service so we sat down and waited to be served. And waited, and waited, and waited. 10 minutes went past with several wait staff walking past us but not making any eye contact, acknowledging us etc. Finally we asked a security guard for a menu and after selecting what we wanted (pretty pricey, though the food that had been served to other looked decent), continued to wait. I figured that they might be busy and understaffed, but we were able to see one of the wait staff slowly counting and sorting the two containers of salt and pepper packets inside the restaurant while we waited.Unbelievable.After being there for 20 minutes without any acknowledgement etc. from any staff in the restaurant we walked off to one of the other place to eat along the quay.Seriously, screw this place
5
We stayed at the motel, but you can use this Caf√© for Breakfast off the street. It's right on Clarke Quay. Staff are very attentive, it's cool and comfortable.
5
Stayed at the hotel for four nights. Had a great breakfast each day.
There was plenty of Asian and western dishes available
5
We enjoyed their super breakfast with a great variety of hot and cold meats, eggs, croissants, great choice of juices(guava, orange, watermelon...)crepes, cereals...hot chocolate, cappucinos,
3
The restaurant has a good buffet dinner offer and it seems like most hungry people from the city is here to eat. They carry plates after plates topped with food.
4
The restaurant seems to cater the buffet customers. We ordered a la carte and were pleased with the food. The service was a little slow but friendly anyway. Maybe the pace is just slower than I was expecting. The food is very good. We tried the Asian foods and were very satisfied
5
wide selection of east/wide combo...there is cold seafood section with boston lobsters, prawns, scallopssashimi/Japanese sectionperanakan section: veru authenticChinese section: was good but seems the most popular dish is the fish - it went to bones as soon as it was serveddessert section: cakes and all for those with a sweet toot
2
This restaurant is meant to have won an award in 2013, but it beats me why. I had the buffet breakfast here being a hotel guest and regretted the choice. So whatever meal you choose to have here, make sure you go al la carte or be disappointed as I was
3
Decided to try this place with a friend, rather than our usual restaurant upstairs in the same building. Turned out to be a terrible experience! We ordered ala carte instead of the buffet, which was what most people were there for.Firstly, the complimentary bread arrived...cold! Very, very cold.We ordered a "Grilled Lamb Rack with roasted potatoes with rosemary jus, garlic mash and ratatouille" (24++SGD) and a "Grilled Salmon with potato gnocchi and poached spinach" (24++SGD) as stated on the menu. Firstly, the grilled salmon was served finally after 30 minutes. The salmon was poached! And tasteless, except for the extremely fishy taste, and it was so un-fresh that the salmon had a mushy texture to it. The 'potato gnocchi' turned out to be fried hash brown balls, which were glistening with what tasted like day-old oil. The lamb arrived, and one of them was COMPLETELY BLOODY and uncooked! Again, fried hash brown balls in day-old oil replaced the 'roasted potatoes'. The ratatouille was some sort of tomato and cucumber salsa dumped in cheap tomato ketchup. Garlic mash was missing, and the 'rosemary jus' was very obviously oyster sauce with vinegar and other weird condiments, all but rosemary.However, when we asked to speak to the manager, he was very accommodating and promised to feedback to the chef. I just wonder how much of our feedback will actually get through :) Have yet to try the buffet and hopefully it will not be as disappointing as such
3
Went for the dinner buffer last night at S$48+++ per pax. Tried almost everything on display.They have essentially maintained about the same spread for years bar one or two new items.Cray fish was a tad salty.Steamed fish was ok and consistent.Indian rojak was nice and sauce was tasty.Loved the pie ti. Kept the taste well. Nonya chicken was nice n tender.Surprisingly, star attraction durian pur√É¬©e has dropped in taste. Was too sweet and lacked the oomph.Coffee was too bitter for my liking.Will come back again if offer of 1 for 1 is available
3
Only had buffet breakfast 3 times, but food selection only changed slightly. Egg and waffle station can get crowded. No wonton or laksa (very surprising for an Singapore hotel).Would not pay for buffet breakfast. Goto "Ya Kun Kaya Toast" or "Swissbake" in nearby Central Shopping Center, much cheaper and better

I was well catered for with my Gluten-free diet.Wonderful breakfasts included in our room rate. Yogurt and butter and jam from France even!

variety of dishes especially for breakfast staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was well cooked and plentiful. The restaurant was spotlessly clean anedensure everywhere was neat and tidy.

I had postponed my reservations for Swissotel Merchant court evening buffet for 4 person from 7/12/13 to 14/12/13 due to unavailable of indoor seats on 7/12/13.Although had booked 2 weeks in advance,upon arrival at the restaurant on 14/12/13 my family and i were told i had REQUESTED FOR 'OUTDOOR' SEATS.Adurey booked for me was so blur and careless that she booked wrongly.Although there are several EMPTY SEATS INDOOR,THE INDIAN MANAGER STILL INSISTED THAT ALL INDOOR SEATS ARE OCCUPIED.Only 1 HOUR LATER ,THAT I WAS TOLD MY FAMILY AND I CAN SHIFT INDOOR TO CONTINUE OUR DINNER!!!!!We were treated like second class citizen outdoor without providing any wet wipe or paper towel on the tableThe food are horrible and no soft drink and ice cream are provided.We were told had to pay for soft drin

I was in a group of 4 adults at dinner during the week. There is a wide variety of items, and some very really excellent - the roast turkey, the lasagna and the sea bass in particular . The desserts were also very good - stollen, Xmas log cakes and mince pies. However we were quite surprised by the slowness in replenishing up several of the items, and it was bizzare to see empty dishes for 15-20 minutes at a star hotel buffet. Plenty of seating, range of cold seafood items and variety of local (Japanese, Singaporean and Malay) items was impressive
3
Service was awful took multiple request for tea before they finally came over with it.The spread was not plenty but good enough to get filled. SElections consist of Japanese,malay,singapore and some chinese. I like the local desserts. The salad were decent...The downside really was the service. Food was acceptable

Commendations to the chef who had greatly ensured the standards of all the food items! Although food could be re-stocked and replenished more frequently. Seafood was quite disappointing cause featured some hairy crabs and mussels and quite surprised to not see any fresh oysters. Considering its a international buffet. Seated by staff and no offer of drinks. Took a good half an hour before we could get some attention. Staff were all hardworking but seriously underhanded due to a saturday. Plates were slow in being cleared due to the same reason. Stewarding department thus also took a long time to return fresh plates, bowls, chopsticks, etc. Which were always in a lack of. Had to ask for chopsticks and bowls on several several occasions. Buffet lasted till 9pm but food stopped replenishing around 8:30 which seems quite odd although the restaurant was practically empty by now. Sashimi were left with a few pathetic pieces and steam fish was only left with their "naked" bodies and yet still "steaming". Chefs did a great job cooking but when asked for replenishment, wasn't quite happy and exuded negative sentiments and vibes. Restaurant also filled with spotlights and coupled with a full seating, was humid and suffocating. Manager was seen addressing some customers with regards to this issue, and my compliments for his attempt. Management might want to replace these high energy consumption heat producing bulbs for a more conservation friendly alternative with similar effects. All in all a place worth revisiting but perhaps in shorts and t-shirt, nothing fancy and don't expect any first class service. More of a hawker fare with a larger variety and more costs due to lack of staff and also a intolerable atmosphere

I went for a dinner buffet at Ellenborough Market Cafe on Monday, 14 October 2013 with 4 other friends. During the buffet dinner, we noticed that the crabs did not taste fresh. The next day, all 5 of us developed symptoms of food poisoning - stomach discomfort, vomitting and diarrhea. Our symptoms worsened and all of us went to the doctor's. One of my friend's symptoms were so severe that she had to be sent to the hospital and put on a drip. I myself vomitted anything I ate or drank for 3 days. Another friend had diarrhea for 4 days. The doctor's diagnosis in all 5 cases was food poisoning.I lodged a formal complaint with the hotel and their reply was that they did not receive any complaints from the other diners for that night. This I have no way of verifying.What I am certain, is that apart from that fateful dinner buffet, we did not had any other food in common in the days before and after that dinner buffet - and all 5 of us came down with food poisoning at the very same time

After sitting on the opposite bank at a seafood restaurant for 20 minutes waiting to see some to serve us we walkout and crossed the river where we found this wonderful restaurant. The variety of food was extensive and beautifully presented. The service was very good and the atmosphere pleasant. We will probably go back when were turn to Singapore tomorrow

Had the international buffet dinner with a group of friends.The spread was very extensive. Seafood lovers have a lot to choose from - big fresh prawns, slipper lobsters, crabs, etc. Sashimi lovers like myself were limited to salmon and yellowtail, which were replenished regularly. There was also a large selection of local Chinese, Malay, Indian and Peranakan dishes, as well as some international dishes. And lots of different desserts.I particularly enjoyed the durian puree, which was responsible for making me go from "very full" to "too full."If you have a huge appetite - like some of my younger friends - it is good value for money

Went there this week for lunch. They are having a seafood based buffet. The prawns are very fresh and crunchy. The baby lobster is a little tough but i will consider it to be quite meaty given its small size. There are crabs as well. The seafood spread is not a lot but the food is fresh. The salmon sashimi is fresh. However, you've to watch out for the bones as they are not removed thoroughly. The cream of mushroom soup is thick and flavorful. I am disappointed by the durian pur√©e. It is not thick and tastes artificially sweet. It is so finely blended that I can hardly find the fibre in it.
4
We ate at this restuarant as we were staying at the hotel. The service was very good as was the food however I thought that the restuarant lacked any ambiance but it could have just been that day - who knows.

Nice buffet at Clarke Quay area, famous for durian dessert. Food quality is good. The variety is consider ok. Price around $42++ per person.

Just had lunch with some friends at the Ellenborough Market Cafe today.The spread? They have a section on peranakan food - 2 veggies, kuey pie tee, sambal prawn, ayam buakeluak. The problem is, every time I go, I see almost the same peranakan dishes. What happen to ayam/itek sio or babi ponteh or babi hong? I think they need to be a little more creative and go beyond fixed dishes. I get bored when my guesses are always 100% right. Even the arrangement of the dishes does not change. Why? It boils down to laziness.The second section features ice-cold seafood. I skipped this section since I am not a fan of ice-cold seafood. I am sure they can consider some warmer dishes here too but the decoration is nice. I like the grey stones placed until the glass tanks. The display is as important as the food. Those in charge of the peranakan section can learn from here.The third section features Japanese food but it is limited to sushi dishes (those rolled in rice) and some sliced salmon. What about tempura and other Japanese dishes? Maybe I am asking for too much. But every section, it seems, suffers from one fixed format. Ice-cold means ice-cold. Rice-wrapped means only rice-wrapped. Hmmm.Next to the Japanese section is the noodles section where a chef will prepare some noodles for you. They had mee-rebus today. An interesting change from the boring laksa or fishball noodles. They even had fried wanton. The mee rebus is average in terms of taste but it is an interesting inclusion. I should give it more marks for this section alone.Opposite the noodles section is the dessert corner. All hot dessert . The rice balls disappointed me because there was only fillings with sesame inside. I thought peanut will be better. One of my friends thought that peanut was left out because some of the guests may be allergic to it. If that was the case, the restaurant should not serve crabs and prawns or any food for that matter because someone will certainly be allergic to some food or other. Conspicuously missing was the cold dessert. There was also no cold sugary drinks available. Yes, the restaurant serves it (at a charge) but it wouldn't kill to include some apple 'juice' or orange squash made from syrup and water. Hmmm.The buffet spread also included lots of nonya kueh-kueh which I abstained because I thought they were more suitable for breakfast or high tea. Anyway,. I also saw some delicious-looking kaya but there was no toast to go with it hence I did not notice anyone taking any kaya (a local coconut plus egg jam). Stange but it happened at the Ellenborough.Of course, for those who like the offending smell of durians, the restaurant has always prided itself for serving durian - the so-called kind of fruits. There are also a good variety of fruits though there was no agar-agar.Finally, the main course. There was roasted duck, stew oxtail, red snapper in some sauce (this was notably the most popular dish), noodles with mushroom, plain rice, prawns in black pepper. The taste? Okay but nothing to shout about. Name a dish that I like the most? It has to be the deep fried yam with mango. The purplish yam is of a good quality and the mango provided that extra dimension to the taste. The flaky covering was crispy and it was fried to the right texture. Nice. Would I go again? Probably but it would not be a craving. I remembered when I first visited the Ellenborough Market Cafe about a decade ago when the cafe was occupying a much smaller floor area, I was thoroughly impressed. Was it me who has changed in my perspective and expectation or was it the cafe that has forgotten that it also needs to continue to surprise and welcome back loyal customers like myself. Apart from competitive pricing, a good restaurant needs to remember to work on its presentation, variety (not just sheer number but vary the dishes, too!) and most importantly, the taste. The roasted duck look delicious but it was as cold as the crabs from the seafood section. Not all food needs to be served cold, you see

The Hotel has great location in the waterfront at Clarke Quay area of Singapore.Their restaurent Ellenbarough Market Cafe in the ground floor facing the waterway has not only got a great decor but also offers a fantastic buffet dinner spread.There was a huge collection of prawns and lobstars in a variety of preperations.There was also the famous singaporean chilli crab.The food was mainly western and oriental but we were surprised to see Madras Mutton Curry the famous mutton curry of south India.And it tasted really authentic.All six of us enjoyed the food very much .However equally surprising was the very very reasonable price of this great buffet at Swissotel Merchant Court.We visited the same place twice again in the next 10 days of our stay in Singapore

I went with my parents and friend for the dinner buffet around New Year period. The first thing that greeted us when we were seated was the party hats and New Year celebration collaterals. Next was the sumptuous food that was beautifully arranged to whet our appetites. My favourite was the seafood on ice and peranakan cuisine. Desserts were more limited but still reasonable. My friend gorged on the slipper lobsters with chilli sauce and shrimps. It was a fabulous food extravaganza!

This is my third time dining here. Food is ok, acceptable. Variety is decent as well. However, the thing to "die" for here is their durian puree! I had three servings. :), They also served a variety fresh seafoods - crabs, prawns, etc. Quite fresh. Didnt had much of it, because i was focusing on their durian puree. :)Overall the service was good, except for this waitress (i think she might be a supervisor, because she was in different uniform). We requested for lemon slice, she ask us to get it from the counter. My friend asked for a dessert spoon, she ask us to get it from the counter. Not much of a service eh? Would I recommend people to go there? Yes, to try their durian puree

I came here with my family for afternoon tea yesterday afternoon. However, the prawn dumplings (har gao) was not nice, my mom also picked an item of food which looks like carrot cake, but it was not nice at all, she said. My husband and my mom ate the raw salmon too, but the colour of the fish was not right. My mom ended up with very bad diahorrea after midnight, and my husband also had diahorrea this morning. :( Shocking to discover that there was a very big mosquito at the edge of my warm water cup, my husband managed to kill the mosquito, and I asked the waiter to change another cup of warm water for me

My hubby wanna go for buffet and I wanna go for Peranakan food, not many places in Singapore provide such deal, except Swisshotel Merchant Court - it provides plenty choices of Peranakan food for buffet, which suits what we wanted.I would say this hotel looks very classy and traditional to me, so does this hotel cafe. I was quite impressed. It has such strong traditional and stylish Peranakan atmosphere in the cafe - the china being used to hold the Peranakan foods, the huge Peranakan printed vase in the middle of food bar etc, all the elements added up to create such harmony environment.Each person pays ard SGD 52++ is a good deal for such environment and quality Peranakan Foods in buffet style. We would definitely consider to visit again :

I ate one dinner at the seafood buffet. The tiger prawns were outstanding. I also ordered a crepe and was about third in line. Went back to sit down, and the cook actually came and got me to make sure I got my crepe. Excellent service
4
I used to have problem in the past trying to book this restaurant...always full. The last two visits in March, I did not have a problem.The dinner buffet is very famous and to me, it was good. The spread was good...There's chilled seafood corner, there's sashimi and sushi, Chilling crab, crayfish, steamed fish, etc.. And even a great selection of desserts!However, what I find lacking was the service. There were many staff there but there were not proactive. There was not bowl of water for you to wash your fingers, the crab's pinches were not cracked and you have to ask for the gadget to help crack the pinches. The other restaurant that is under the same group and serve similar buffet provides such good service that makes you feel that the Ellenborough Market Cafe has much to improve on

what you should expect from a buffet breakfast.
good range of food and catering for different tastes
4
Pricey but offers a nice buffet spread for dinner. Food is almost excellent and the dining crowd, thankfully, the well mannered profile. Great for a romantic date.
3
A decent variety, and we got this as a free upgrade! If its not part of your package, there's certainly plenty of choices for good breakfast nearby.
5
great variety of food - really worth the price. The Sushi and fish provided is fresh and tasty- salads and local cuisine also above ordinary . Recommend a visit to their buffet lunch or dinner
4
We ate here on spec and were impressed with the quality, range and volume of food. Not the cheapest option at Clarke Quay but a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
3
Food wise is fine, but the peranakan food section needs more work, there are places that are better. International selection could do with more choices perhaps. Desserts are good. Service is good too; guy named Bill waiting our table of 13 was nice. Atmosphere is okay, although they had to put standing fans to circulate the air and cool the place. The drinking glasses were dirty, not the outside of it but the INSIDE of the glass.

There is a great buffet available in tge Ellenborough but having had our fill of asian food we chose items from the menu. The food was very good quality and reasonably priced. The real issue during our visit was the service. Initially it was fine but staff became much more interested in setting up breakfast rather than serving dinner guests. Having waited 15 minuits after finishing our main course and still not had any of the staff approach us, we gave up and went to our room for coffee. The service let down an otherwise good food outlet

Absolute value for money. You'll get a decent spread of local dishes (Chinese, Malay and Indian) and international cuisine (seafood on ice, sashimi) and save room in your tummy for dessert - the durian penget is a must-try! Though this buffet may not be as exquisitely presented as the Straits Kitchen at Hyatt Hotel, you're not going to find the fare any less tastier - guaranteed satisfaction. Reserve a table to avoid disappointment - they often have to turn diners away

Part of the Swiss Executive Club entitlement is an opportunity to have breakfast at the Ellenborough Market Cafe as opposed to having it in the club lounge. The buffet spread would be extensive with more variety, so says the lounge receptionist.I was not disappointed, to say the least. From the moment I stepped in till I left the restaurant, I was overwhelmed by the atmosphere and quality of food. We were given the option of sitting indoors or outdoors. Needless to say, being in sunny Singapore; I chose to sit indoors. Though it was peak breakfast time, 9.30am on a Saturday, I managed to get a nice table by the wall. The restaurant covers a huge floor area, with tables that accommodated two to ten people. I was brought back to colonial times, as the ambience reminded me of being in the company of residents in the Raffles Hotel, or any of the colonial buildings that still stands in the city. The buffet spread was concentrated in the mid-section of the restaurant. It was further sectionalized into food of the Western or Asian variety. Both were equally mouth watering. I had my choice of choosing anything from pancakes, ala minute eggs and corned beef (western cuisine) to kway teow, carrot cake and spring onion pancakes (asian cuisine). Cut tropical fruits took pride of place in another area of the spread. If I had a hearty appetite, I would have had more than one helping. The bread selection was in another part of the restaurant, for lack of space in the main area. I guess things cannot be that perfect as the spread where the bread was laid out was not so noticeable, so I had to ask a service personnel where it was. In summary, if you have thoughts of lazing away your Saturday morning with quality food and a cosy atmosphere, I recommend spending it here.

Buffet spread for lunches and dinners include Japanese sashimi & sushi, many local and Peranakan dishes. Local favourites are the durian dessert and fried carrot cakes. S$58++ per adult for dinner is expensive if you are 'small eater' who does not have the appetite to try every dish
4
We only had breakfast here, but the choice of food was great.
5
We only ate here once but the food was very good, definitely recommened
5
Breakfast to die for. Had to make sure we were up to enjoy the great selection of tasty breakfast options from American to Asian style and everything in between.
4
A wide range of good food and you must be able to find dishes that please you. Be careful not to choose food from a dish that is not very full, it may be too cool, wait till it has been refilled.
5
eat here in the morning if you stay at the hotel and choose an outside table to enjoy the river view and morning air. (also being jealously watched by commuters who are rush to their work.. :P)

all gud. been perfect so far. back n forth to this hotel area n try others, but yeah, def. this is the best for me.
5
It's in the Swissotel Merchant Court. We asked for 2 lime juices. They had none but the young waiter went off, found some limes and made it himself. He brought a small jug of sugar syrup to go with it in case we wanted it sweeter.What a darling!
1
The seats were comfy. The staff made us feel uneasy. Coffee and tea was luke warm at breakfast. Food seemed to be stale even after they topped up the display. Response from hotel was they were undergoing kitcehn renovations, in which case they shoudl have shut it down and let us eat elsewhere
5
We were lucky to get a table for six at the last minute. Arriving at the Swissotel Merchant Court Hotel, it looked like a spruced up market place but once inside the long corridor, the Ellenborough Market Caf√© was amazing. Crowded with families. Delectables from Nyonya kueh (cakes) to chicken curry, laksa, fresh fruit salad and much much more. Tea and coffee were regularly refilled by attentive waiters. An informal caf√©, with practical furniture and pleasant d√©cor. Highly recommended

Nine of us met for the Peranakan and other Asian food themed high tea buffet and generally enjoyed the food especially the durian penget, satay and rojak. The staff was attentive but unobtrusive, the ambience was cosy and comfortable and a good time was had by all. The only problem was that settling the bill and the car park coupons took a long time as some of the waiters did not appear to know what to do or what to say. Overall, however, I would recommend this buffet to all who want a comfortable place to relax , chat and enjoy the fairly wide selection of Peranakan food. Peranakan friends who were there agreed that the best dish was the durian penget. There was also a fairly wide selection of dishes available for the vegetarians among the group
