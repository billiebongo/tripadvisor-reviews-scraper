we had a few hours before a meeting, and decided to grab a bottle of bubbly and some small bites - we weren't disappointed here. must come back for the full experience on our next trip!
5
We dropped in for dessert and wine after eating street food. What a contrast. The staff was gracious even though we were a small order. The dessert was flavorful and rich and a lovely glass of wine. To be sure, we will have the full dining experience next time
5
We were so glad that we went to this restaurant.Food was soo delicious with awesome plating. We were also given a complimentary cake. The wine that the staff reccomended was well paired with the food that was served.Staff were very attentive but at the same time gave us our privacy.Will definitely be back again

I just report Le Nicolas as one of the best French restaurant in Singapore, only because I do not test all of them. Nicolas is one of the best chief I know, and I use to have dinner in his place since ten years ago. He deserves to have stars in Michelin. If you want have delicate, tasty, amazing quality food you have to try his restaurant and his generous way to cook. He is a specialist about wine, and you can trust him to choose your wine. Do not miss this must address if you appreciate fine French cuisine

I was lucky to get a table for lunch on New Year's Day – thanks, chef Nicolas! There was a set menu with 4 or 5 courses, which meant that I took all of the starters, a main course (from three alternatives if I remember correctly) and a dessert. There was also an amuse-bouche with foie gras! I took one glass of house white and one glass of red; I think they were the only wines by the glass but I could not justify a whole bottle for myself. The combination of flavour and texture was innovative and everything was cooked to the point of perfection. I enjoyed all courses and would definitely return when I am back in Singapore
5
We’ve recently discovered this restaurant. The chef is creating a new tasting menu every two weeks and it’s reeeally good) the personal favorite is Hokkaido scallops plate with and a prawn with the best leek and potato soup I’ve ever eaten. The wine by the glass list is short but the wines are excellent and very well priced! The only complaint is a little bit long waiting time but chef does most (or everything?) himself and it shows in the quality of the food he brings out. The service is excellent too, the administrator/hostess is very attentive and friendly. Really recommended and worth the $! Thanks, chef, for the delicious experience
5
Invited for a champagne paired dinner in August. Last time we were at Nicolas was when they were in the adjoining Keong Saik Street. Excellent food that evening. Every dish had just the correct combination of flavours and taste. The ambience was also welcoming and warm. Service was efficient
5
The most discreet restaurant among the French fine dining community in Singapore,and yet one of the best. We truly enjoyed every time we dined there.The restaurant has been open for nearly 11 years and it is easy to understand why it is hard to get a reservation. There is only 5/6 tables, top ingredients, top wine list and top service, top value for money..what else
5
We had a blast last night at Nicolas. We visited for our anniversary and we truly enjoyed our time there. I am a foodie and love tasting menus but it can be an expensive business especially in Singapore. Every course was well executed, amazing flavours and neat presentation. Wine pairing was amazing too!The ambience felt intimate and cosy - nice to have the chef coming to our table to introduce every course and wines.6 course tasting plus wine pairing for 2 wad only around $320! Amazing value for Singapore standards.The pictures of the venue and the food don't do justice - need to go and visit!!!
5
This was a random restaurant I ended up Googling when I was searching for a French restaurant to try. I'm glad to say I look forward to returning. I was told this place served of a old school French food. I loved all the dishes they served from the 5 course (iirc) tasting I got. The egg at the 4th picture is one of the best eggs I've had in my life. The hokkaido scallop in the broth was amazing too. It was fun to eat the pigeon as I like gamey meat. This isn't a place to eat at if you want to leave full though. The price for thr quality of food and service is awesome though.
5
Very cosy intimate French restaurant. Food is leaning towards modern French with a touch of fusion. The Hokaido scallops is the highlight of the meal. Service was attentive. Overall a great dinning experience.
4
Hosted the year end dinner for my company. They offered one for one wine for free corkage, we had a five course dinner with the lamp rack as the main. Good service and excellent ambience
4
Owner Nicolas puts his mark of experience onto the menu, solid French based fare with a fresh twist. Open kitchen concept lets you see the efficiency with which he operates and I like him addressing the clients personally and engage
5
The dinner was amazing. I do not drink alcohol at the moment, but this did not interfere with the enjoyment of this outstanding food.
5
great modern french fare with chilled out ambiance. small restaurant and kitchen team focusing on set menu (main dish has 4-5 amazing options). menu changes every 2 weeks. Chef Nicolas was great, recommended me an excellent wine after discussing my taste. really couldn't fault anything - perhaps the front of house manager could have been a bit less seriou
5
We went there for the first time ever after a tip from a friend. In a nutshell: wonderful dinner, we had the set menu for S$98++ and every single part of it was amazing. Amuse bouche, superb shrimp/squid, brilliant eg, unbelievable scallop, perfect lamb and what a dessert to finish off. We liked it and we will be back. Only negatives were a group of 20 or so Chinese celebrating something and they were very loud, especially after some alcohol. So it appears this is a restaurant that accepts big groups that make a lot of noise, meaning that if you are looking for a romantic or quiet dinner, you might want to check first if they have a group or not on that same evening. Some of the younger staff don't speak English very well, or at least they never seem to understand what you mean when you talk to them, but in all honesty, when we go to a restaurant these are details. The food and atmosphere is what is most important and what it is all about. And the food is really superb, that is why there is no doubt we will be back
4
We dined here with friends to pre-celebrate Christmas. The restaurant is a cosy place and intimate. There was only the tasting menu when we visited so we chose that. There is very little choice for vegetarians on the menu. The snacks were tasty, and we really enjoyed all our dishes. The tastes were clean, fresh and flavoursome. I would say this is a modern international restaurant rather than just French. Service was attentive but let down by the fact that the waiting staff couldn't explain the dishes as they served them. So the overall experience could be improved by having some more professional waiting staff. There is much potential here and we will visit again

I have enjoyed Chef Nicolas cooking for many years and dined at all 3 of his restaurants in Singapore. The quality of the ingredients is consistenly excellent, which is no mean feat in Singapore where fresh fine farm produce is hard to come by. Unlike many French restaurants in Singapore, Nicolas has a light touch which means letting the ingredients speak for themselves and not masking their flavour (or lack of it) with spices and sauces.Our family is fussy about food: in Singapore, we select our favourite hawker stalls with care; when in France, we spend our limited time dining almost exclusively in Michelin-star restaurants. Yet we do not chase Michelin stars in Singapore and did not bother to step into the name-brands like Guy Savoy and Joel Robuchon here - because those are merely chains when here. Nicolas is our favourite French restaurant in Singapore and we hold all our 'major occasion' meals there. we must have enjoyed over 50 meals with him, and every one has been excellent.Many in the fine-dining community here have been shocked by Michelin's first guide to Singapore in which hawkers preparing a single dish at a low price point were found worthy of stars where established restaurants were not. The experiences are of couse chalk and cheese and not directly comparable. For whatever reason, Nicolas remains an undiscovered Michelin star(s) - take advantage if this while you can, it is only a matter of time
5
On the top of our list, we are always looking forward to our next dinner.The qualilty of the ingredients and the creativity is superb, great vibes and excellent service. The staff make you feel at home from the moment you step in. The tasting menu and the wine is a good value for money
5
We were fortunate on a visit to Singapore to be part of a private group who enjoyed a marvellous dinner at Nicolas. The group occupied most of the restaurant and brought its own fine wines to accompany Chef Nicolas Joanny's 5 course dinner, adapted from the restaurant's usual menu for the occasion.After a canapÃ© we started with Sicilian red prawns in a clam bouillon, then confit toothfish with French abalone, then orechiette pasta with pigeon and black truffle, followed by main course of Tasmanian lamb before a selection of matured French cheeses. Each dish was excellent, showing the fine touch of a great chef, but the orechiette pasta dish with pigeon and black truffle was truly outstanding, one of the best pasta dishes we have had anywhere in the world.The ambience is warm and friendly but efficient with great service including sympathetic wine service and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of fine stemware. There is a chef's table area with a full view of the glass fronted kitchen, which can be partly seen from the main dining area.In a city known for its cuisine and great restaurants, this is fine dining in one of the very best
5
Very attentive and accommodating staff. The portions were just right. For the set menu, we had 4 appetisers before the main. Nice presentation n great taste. Will go back again!
5
Probably the best French -European restaurant in Singapore.
Great wine selection and well executed French food by chef Nicolas.
5
Spectacular in all sense of the word, from food to service. Chef was extremely accommodating. Staff was professional and attentive. Food was heavenly and creative. A must visit. Have been here many times and will certainly be back again.
5
I've been to Nicolas three times and I'm always amazed every time. Professional and friendly staff, beautifully crafted delicious meals and great atmosphere. They've definitely got the recipe right!
5
We stumbled upon this place after a bad initial experience at Burnt Ends (tiny table facing a wall, no room to eat, crowded etc etc). So a quick search revealed this place, wow wee, its straight in as my favorite restaurant in Singapore for fine dining.Quality service and decor, knowledgeable staff, all the key fundamentals, but it was the menu that really set this place apart. Apparently it changes very regularly, but the tasting menu was really special, an amazing eclectic selection of ingredients, Japanese prawns, Spanish ham etc all done in an innovative and sympathetic manner. Every dish stood on its own, the accompaniments were quality and the wine list not too big, not too small, just right. A truly faultless and enjoyable dining experience
5
Love this place. Wonderful, creative food, great wine pairings, and the chef regularly comes to greet the guests and check on you personally. Service is perfect. Lovely selection of wines. A delicious 3 course meal that won't break the bank - a rare find in Singapore.
5
One of the best hidden gem in Singapore, Very discreet and always very good.The service is so accommodating and the ambiance is nice.The tasting menu is probably the best value in town and among others fine dining in Singapore.The starters are mostly sea food, Hokkaido scallop with corn, Sicilian prawn and abalone! The pigeon is always on my top of the list (so far i haven't experience better)Insane Cheese trolley, i guess more than 25 different kind of cheeses served with an unusual eggplant jam
4
we had a gathering of work buddies including ex colleagues at nicolas le, to celebrate birthdays for those born in Jul and celebrate our friendship going back to the mid 1990s.the menu was specially prepared for our group of 22 pax. there was 1. poached egg in an open egg shell. the yoke was still soft like the type we get when eating ramen.2. two prawns in some tomato based sauce. 3. scallop with prawn bisque with a wanton like ravioli in the thick soup. 4.a piece of grilled pigeon (i think so) or it could be duck. its red meat. 5. a piece of pork tender grilled. almost like wagyu from looks. 6. assorted cheese. 7 coffee plus a birthday cake (we bought from Paris baguette) with added ice cream provided by the restaurant. we brought our own alcohol.overall the food is well presented and taste good and some favours quite unique as first time experience. the service was excellent. we were such a noisy bunch and the staff accommodated us and took good care of us including taking our group photos. its actually a fine dining place. quite romantic. located at the fringe part of chinatown near keong siak street which used to be a red light district a few decades back. there could still be some brothels around today but i guess they are highly discreet in their facades compared to the old days where the sign was a unit number is colored red and is displayed in a light box above the entrance.:)can come again
5
Where do I start? Atmosphere was very cozy and pleasant. Excellent selection of wines as well! We had the tasting menu, each and every dish was an explosion of flavour with the components paired together harmoniously in culinary symphony.Highlight of the dinner was the Hokkaido Scallop, wonderfully seared and served with the most divine bouillon! Just when we thought we couldn't be anymore satisfied, the friendly service staff brought over the cheeses. Wish we could've just had the whole board! Wonderful selection and experience, would definitely recommend
5
I am lucky to lunch at Nicolas regularly as my boss is a fan of this small restaurant near Keong said area. We tried the dinner for my friend birthday, 8 of us. The menu was superb, we opted for the 4 courses at $78++. This menu is normally not available on Saturday but the manager said it is okay to have it. The portions are just right and every dishes are full of flavors and texture. We had two btl of wine around $80, very good and reasonable considering the quality. We were surprised to see a b'day cake together with the dessert, that's was a nice attention. Great fine dining experience without paying an insane price
5
Very pleasant restaurant for business or for a romantic dinner. Delightful food and just the right portions paired with a number of well chosen wines. Planning the next visit...
5
Enjoyed the tasting menu
Everything was perfect with fresh ingredients like they were just taken from the market
One of the best places we've ever tried in Singapore
5
We went to Nicolas le Restaurant for a birthday celebration last weekend. I was very excited to try the tasting menu and it was really great! I enjoyed almost each dishes! . However, the cheese platter was too small for $18++. Personally I think it should be served a bigger portion. Wines are too expensive as well. Though, staff were very attentive to the customers. Overall, it was an great experience to dine at Nicolas
5
Years after years Chef Nicolas has been consistent, in the food quality and in keeping a very good service standard.The ingredients and the technique are great.The chef is not afraid to offers unusual ingredients like fresh abalone, Carabinero Prawn, Spanish pork cooked rose.We normally go for the $98++ 6 courses menu and we never get disappointed.This is a fine dining without arrogance.A special mention to the wine list, huge considering the restaurant has only 25 seats, but really exiting if you are a wine lover, and value for money
5
This restaurant has been opened for 9 years and we only heard about it recently, what a shame!!There is two options for dinner $4 courses a la carte ($78++) and 6 courses tasting menu ($98++). We opted for the a la carte, 2 starters, main and dessert.It is all about ingredients, Carabinero prawn, Langoustine, fresh foie gras...An outstanding pigeon and surprisingly a Spanish black pig (rose!!). They have the best cheese trolley I ever seen in Singapore.The service is really concern about making us comfortable, we choose a btl of Bordeaux at $180 but the waitress push us to order a wine from the Languedoc region at $90, it was a real discovery.We went back the following weekend for the full tasting..
5
I was recommended to Nicholas by a friend that has lived in Singapore for 20 years. In my opinion, overall value for money and quality this is most definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore. There are not many tables, so you will have to book in advance for sure. Nicholas himself has cooked in some of the best Michelin restaurants in Europe and it shows. I have been twice for lunch, and the menu changes every two weeks which I like. There are only two menus, one is 3 course and the other is 5 course. The 3 course is more than enough, and if you are still hungry you can try some of his cheeses from the cheese board, which are great. Last time I had the Iberico bellota for the main course, it was really outstanding, as well as the prawn raviolo for a starter. Dessert is a combination of 3 small items, also very very good. The price? $42 per person! This is now one of my top 3 restaurants in Singapore and I highly recommend it, I have never rated a restaurant 'excellent' in all areas of service, food and value as there is always room for improvement but my visit there was truly outstanding
5
What a nice evening we had.. This is a real small Gem in Singapore.. 25, maybe 30 seats restaurant nested in the middle of China Town.. Nicolas and his staff make a fantastic job. We took the "degustation" menu which is a set menu with lots of different flavors.. Amazing meat, some "ecrevisse", each time served with some beautiful "emulsions".. In the middle of the meal, we had a plate of Spanish ham (amazing).. The house wine is one of the best "savigny les beaume" that I ever had. Also I decided to try the white wine for the dessert, "vouvray", super fresh, was perfect. The choice of the cheese, hum, you can see that Nicolas is a Cheese lover, the way he select them.. Another great time just before the dessert. Last but not least, the service is "impeccable".. Once again bravo and keep going this way. 
5
This is a chef's "my dream" business. The restaurant is tiny, beautifully decorated, with big tables and plenty of space between them. It's quiet, with a discreet street frontage.The maitre(sse) d' was professional and helpful. The serving staff were a little nervous, but attentive. The food was, as expected, absolutely of the highest quality: fresh, inventive, gorgeously presented, and tasty. It's quite a meaty menu, with strong flavours, but portions are not overly large so we didn't feel uncomfortably overfed.I swapped the menu fixe dessert for cheeses, and congratulated myself that I did so as the cheese board was excellent (although my companion had desserts and was equally happy). The wine list is good beyond my capacity to appreciate! By Singapore fine-dining standards it was relatively well priced.Not for everyday, or even every week, but for an important meal, or just glorious self-indulgence... nothing here could be faulted. If I had to be really picky, I'd say that the lighting could be a little better (it was a tad too subdued at lunchtime), and the chef could have spent a little more time chatting to guests. But I'm forcing myself to nitpick here. This is a classic
4
Fine French cusine with good service to match. A cosy restaurant near to chinatown serving up michelin star food. Appropriate for those with sophisticated tastebuds and wine lovers. We brought our own wines and the corkage policy was very reasonable. It was an enjoyable night out for the family and our course included scallops, prawns, foie gras, lamb....most of which melts in your mouth with intense flavours. Excellent experience and not too pricey
5
It was a tough week, three dinners at three fine dining restaurants, on top of other lunches and dinners. And dinner here stood out for its sheer quality delivered with minimal staff.I have always enjoyed eating here, but Nicolas upped it a notch that night. Every flavour and texture was clear and in balance, standing up very well against the wines we brought
5
I have been to Nicolas a few times now and have always enjoyed my meal. Look forward to going back again.
4
Not too expensive to come with friends. Food is not bad. Service a little hurried.
But I prefer the taste of food at the former locale.
3
The scallop appetizer wasn't great but main course lamb was good. The breads and selection of cheeses did really well in filling up the before main meal and before dessert. Didn't like the selection of 4 mini desserts however.
4
A group of us had our wine pairing tasting menu at S$188++ in this cosy and intimate place nestled in the old part of Singapore. Great value for money. The service is attentive and professional. Food is prepared and cooked by Chef Nicolas Joanny, which is rare, as many celebrity chefs talk-more-cook-less these days. The rack of lamb is exceptional and highly recommended. Beware that food portion is in real French portion
5
Went to Nicolas Le Restaurant with husband for Saturday dinner, we took the Tasting Menu with a bottle a wine recommended by the lady manager. Everything tastes so delicious from appetizers, main course to dessert. The scallop tastes so great that hubby almost took mine :) Service is fabulous, the manager, the wine sommelier and all the other waiting staff are professional and friendly. Even customers in this restaurant are very pleasant as well, we had a nice chat with our neighbor - a lovely couple who appreciate wine & dine like us. Chef came to say Goodbye before we left for the night, shall certainly come back soon
5
Recommended to us by a friend living in Singapore, my wife and I dined here one evening. Booked the Chef's table and had the degustation menu, with wine to match. Not much we could say other than this was an amazing meal at a small, intimate and out of the way restaurant. Not cheap, but worth it. Compared to a number of the 'top' restaurants in town, at the high-profile locations, this place is a stand-out. You would think you were in Paris, at some little place you discovered by accident
5
Lovely intimate atmosphere. The restaurant is quite small (maybe 10 tables in all). We were welcomed with complimentary champagne and delicious cold appetizers. The food is wonderful - creative, delicious. We ordered (I think it was called) the set menu. VERY reasonably priced. The chef came out and served us one of the dishes and chatted with us to ensure everyone's ecpectations were met (for us they were exceeded). I loved each course - the jumbo prawn, the beef, the scallop, and wow, the cheese plate for dessert was to die for. This is a great place for a special occasion or to enjoy with friends. We were not rushed one bit and stayed very late
3
It was my first time at le Nicolas. When I made the reservation, it would have been nice to have been advised that they only offer set menus on certain days - and no a la carte. Unfortunately, the person who took my reservation seemed a bit disorganized and offered no such information. When I arrived, I was disappointed to have been seated right at the back, next to the kitchen where the tables seem to have been put there almost as an afterthought. It was far too warm and far too bright from the kitchen heat and lights. The wait staff kept on squeezing through all evening -- not pleasant at all! Also, one of my pet peeves is being served bottled still or sparking non-stop, wait staff opening up bottle after bottle (without asking if you want another bottle). The staff did this brilliantly, even after I asked for tap water. We had to wait quite a while for our first course to come. But when the food did come, it was very good and I especially enjoyed the ravioli and pork with asparagus. The lamb was a little bit too pink for my liking. The selection of wine was good. And the selection of cheese was impressive.But overall, after spending about $250 per person - it just didn't seem worth it. Did I enjoy the food? Yes, definitely. Would I go back there again? Probably not. For that kind of money, I expect a better experience or at least a better table
5
I had had a recommendation for Nicolas from a friend of a friend and am very glad I took his advice. Not only is the food and wine delicious and very well thought out, Nicolas himself is a totally hands on chef, doing everything from preparing the food to actually serving it and recommending wine. We opted for the surprise menu (8 courses of......well, you don't know what) and I would do this every time. It is by no means cheap, but certainly not overpriced and well worth the final bill.I travel to Singapore for business frequently and Nicolas will be on my list of places to visit each time
4
We spend Christmas at this restaurant. I´d say that the environment is nice but the place is quite small, very easy to get full and then some table are very close to each other. I asked for sparkling water, the first glass was ok but the following glasses of water were not sparkling at all, i didn´t pay attention to this, but is something to improve. There is only one toilet for men a women.The food was tasty but honestly in few quantity. we have three entrances and one main dish, at the end i´ll say we have 4 entrances. The wine is quite expensive (even for Singapore) for the brands and ages they offe
5
a group of us visited and opted for the 4-course (rather than 6 course). A smart move, as the food was ample. Very tasty, topped with great service. The wine list is extensive, but a bit toppy (pricey). all in all, a great night out.
4
My husband and I spent New Years Eve at Nicolas. There was full house of 30 and a staff of 3 waiting and 3 in the kitchen, including Nicolas.The evenings set menu, duck rillette, scallops, pork, cod,steak, cheese and dessert served at a comfortably slow pace with plenty bread and butter to fill the gap. Decoratively arranged,often on slate plates which were very attractive the amounts were small but adequate. The cod was superb, the best I have tasted in years. The steak was tender and done as requested but served too cold. They reheated ours when asked. The only fault we found was their sparkling water does not sparkle, but when we commented on this a staff member went out returned with a large bottle of Pelligrino. A delightful and highly recommended restaurant with hands on Chef Nicolas
4
I was theer for a year end business dinner and the chef cooked just for us. The flavors were un expected and a beautiful surprise. We had a lot of dishes and they were one more suprior than the others. I strongly recommend this place for an intimate dinner out. I had the cod as my mains and I have never eaten a better preparation of the fish
5
We went to the restaurant after a recommendation from one of our friends. Being french you always expect a little bit more from a french restaurant abroad and we loved it ! the place is small, intimate, nice staff, lovely french waitress came from the same village as us in france !! Chef Nicolas is actually cooking and very available, very friendly and it does add to the experience. Food is absolutely delicious, prices are right and the all evening was a real treat. Not only we recommend the place but we will come back again, sooner rather than later !!!
3
We were taken here by some friends who have just relocated to Singapore. Everything looked really fabulous and smart when we entered the restaurant and were seated. Menus arrived along with the water and the evening was getting off to a great start.I ordered the venison which I requested as medium rare. The waitress then said not rare and I replied no. I was then absolutely horrified when she said you don't like blood - just as well your not a woman!The other guests at the table were horrified. No one had any idea why she made that comment.Notwithstanding this the food was good and the wines were fantastic - our friends were exceedingly generous with the wines.It would have been the perfect evening if not for that comment. I don't think we will ever return
4
I just been once and I think than I have to come back over and over. The food was good, the ambience Ok. The price is not astronomic, so I will recommend people to go and have a good food experience.The chef really use world ingredients to give you a nice and yummy meal. Is a must try for every foodie
5
This place is a real gem in the fine dining world of Singapore. I celebrated my birthday here, as did several others on the same night & it was truly a wonderful occasion.It didn't start so well with one of the waiters trying to give us half full glasses of flat champagne but the very efficient maitre d took over & made sure we had full glasses of fizzing champagne.All 11 courses of the tasting menu were incredible & chef Nicolas personally served & explained the perfect wine selection for each course.I couldn't get enough of the food & being on the chefs table allowed us to see the energy & passion that went into creating it. The junior waitress was always attentive too & full of energy & smiles which combined with the maitre d's excellent management led to us having seamless service too.My partner had a vegetarian version which was also incredible if a little too rich & dependent on variations of cheese but she loved it nonetheless. Highly recommended especially as both food & wine were amazingly priced at the low end of Singapore's fine dining experiences.Definitely will be returning.
5
Nicolas le Restaurant is one of those small, somewhat inconspicuous restaurants that rewards the diner with a relaxing ambience, excellent food and wine list and very good value for money. Located in a quiet street in Chinatown, Nicolas offers a couple of excellent set menus for lunch, each with a limited choice. This is one of its strengths as each dish is a masterpiece; a large number of choices often makes one ask how stretched is the kitchen to deliver the quality hoped for. The wine list creates interest due to its diversity and on the two occasions I have been to Nicolas (both in the last 6 months; I am a visitor from Australia) other wine lovers have also been present to enjoy top quality wine with the food to match. This is a glowing endorsement of the restaurant
4
With silly rents and the F&B labour squeeze, I don't know how Nicolas Joanny maintains his high standards at the prices he charges. Check out the menu on the website. I did after being put off by the prices at another restaurant. We had the 3 course lunch menu at $42++. With complimentary rilletes and a couple of slices of lomo, good bread and butter, sparkling water and a tasty glass of red Savigny 2010 and coffees, the bill for 2 came to SGD137.71. High quality ingredients are used and portions are generous. The level of the dishes is very good to excellent. Some of the staff were a bit inexperienced, but the overall "white-tablecloth" service was good. The food is French, influenced by Japanese outlook/technique after Nicolas' working break in Japan. Do yourself a favour and try it
5
The start attraction of this wonderful restaurant is its personality -- and that of owner/chef and his staff. Nothing industrial here, instead expect a top quality degustation at a fair price, although as always in Singapore, adding wine changes the bottom-line far more than it should (thanks to the local tax regime). Don't expect perfection: expect passion and a genuine intent to make it new. I loved it, twice so far. The place is small, so book ahead
4
The food didnt disappoint. Fresh and of top notch quality. The waiters are very attentive as well. Will definitely be back.
5
Had a lovely meal for 2 on Friday night. Atmosphere was wonderful, not too noisy light at right level, service smooth and not over the top. Food was 1st class. Set menu was well balanced all the flavours came through and there was more than enough to feel full at the end of the evening. Wine was recommended by Nicolas and was a good accompaniment to the meal without breaking the bank. Cheese was best I have had in Singapore - well conditioned - a real treat. We will be going back. Cost was S$400 for 2 with wine and all the usual ++'s. If you are looking for a restaurant for a special night out, this should be on your list
5
Just got back from dinner for 5 of us.Very busy restaurant tonight, but great, highly responsive and knowledgable service as ever, and just delicious, original food using the best ingredients and cooked to perfection. And all for really very sensible prices.Over the years and many visits I've had the very occasional average experience here - but only by Nicolas' exceptionally high usual standards. Almost invariably I have left with a beaming smile on my face. It's great to see the patron himself evidently cooking every dish for you in person.Having experienced many more vaunted establishments around the world and wildly higher prices and inferior food and service I have no hesitation in recommending Nicolas to anyone looking for a wonderful evening of delicious food, service and ambience
5
Chef Nicolas cooks an array of delicious dishes which are reminiscent to 3 Michelin Star cuisine. It may look small but go through the degustation menu and you will be satisfied with quantity but especially the refined quality. Small and intimate, efficient and friendly service: it is amazing what Nicolas pulls of with 2 1/2 people in his kitchen. I highly recommend the Pelt risotto with goose liver and mushroom, the pigeon which melts in your mouth, the succulent king prawn, this menu is a summit.....
4
Friday evening with reservation.room and ambiance are cosy, well organized, giving enough room around the table.for the price paid, the menu is quite interesting. Excellent mains : the meat we had (lamb and venison) was really outstanding. The starters were interesting and creative. The dessert is certainly a let down, but i had swapped for the cheese board which is truly exceptional for Singapore.some minor downsides : we did not want the degustation menu which was the only one proposed "for the week end"; we were of course accomodated, but with the restriction that we were asked to have the same starters choice my wife and I ??? Service was a bit uncertain, maybe due to a beginner waiter. And as mentionned above, dessert will be disapointing for the sweet teeth..
5
We scanned trip advisor and discovered this restaurant and were not disappointed.Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Staff attentive, food delicious and ambiance very pleasant. All three of us were equally impressed. Nicolas, Le Restaurant sits price wise in the mid range economically but from our standpoint in the upper range of desirable placed to eat in this expensive city.Presentation of the food had a definite style with ?possibly Japanese influences. Also noteworthy is that despite the smallish size of the individual dishes, overall the quantity of food was quite satisfying as there were inclusions of complimentary surprise additional courses. Wine list extensive and a tad expensive.Not an easy place to find, glad we took a cab. Would unreservedly recommend

This is the first time we have a fusion of french and japanese style cuisine, and the chef did a great job! Emphasis on the original flavour of the food, excellent services provided by the staff, really worth the search on here! Just one suggestion to make it even better would be the padsion of food when explaining the menu and dishes, and the clarity of English for one of the staff we have will make it perfect.

chose this restaurant after consulting trip advisor!it is a genuine small french restaurant in the heart of singapore, with a visible and friendly french owner/chefwe had the tasting menu...we have had better meals in france, but not many! very, very good food.good french wine by the glass, and an extensive wine list. service was friendly but not quite top notch. two locals at separate tables went to the service tables to get their own wine to serve!just a little bit of tidying up to do, but to be honest it did not detract from the evening...in fact the lack of pretention was refreshing!price good for the quality S$300 for two

Enjoyed the Tasting Menu. Each course is a surprise with different tastes, texture and some fusion of tastes. The Hokkaido scallop was excellent. The main course pigeon done medium was a complete blow away. Dessert was an array of bite sized cakes and ice cream of sort

So I found myself in Singapore and was taken to this restaurant. I did not know what to expect other that it was recommended as one of the places to try while in Singapore. Off we went then. First thing that threw me off a bit was the concept. a 7 or 8 courses meal where you only really have the choice for the main course. The rest is the same for everyone. Now that can sound exciting (it was to me) or not so much if you can't eat some of the items they pre-selected for you (my wife could not eat the Pigeon, so I ate it LOL). I can't remember exactly what every dish was but man oh man! I had never expected to eat that well and be that WOWed. Every course was phenomenal. White Asparagus, Perfectly cooked Egg, Caviar, Japanese broth, Prawns, Pigeon... and pork for main course. Too bad all the pictures are still in my camera. Wine list is also pretty good and there are some wines there that are not easily found in Singapore (or even France for that matter). I cannot recommend this place enough to everyone that wants to have a fabulous meal. Will be back for more as soon as I am in Singapore again

We had dinner with wine pairing. Excellent, refined French cuisine . Sommelier Michael and Chef Nicolas were both very friendly . Extremely enjoyable dinner experience

I booked dinner for 3 people and that doubled in size to 6 people to celebrate my 70th Birthday.All my guests flew in from Australia for the occasion and all were blown away by this excellent restaurant. We absolutely enjoyed the Tasting Menu Number 196 complete with paired wines at SGD 188 ++ and considered it great value.Chef Nicolas and his staff were ever present and yet did not interrupt our dinner in any way.The portion sizes were just the right size and the quality was excellent. Chef Nicolas has been trained in 2 & 3 star Michelin Restaurants, and it shows, and when he preempted our departure by standing in the street to hail two taxis for us, we were blown away again.This in the opinion of my 5 guests is the best restaurant in Singapore.

Had lunch here on the recommendation of a friend who is a true restaurant connoisseur and it lived up to its reputation.Delightful setting on the edge of Chinatown (but nothing's too far away in Singapore) in an area of shophouses that now contains several restaurants. Had the very reasonable set lunch. Portions are small, but really couldn't fault the food nor its presentation. The pigeon (not on the menu but apparently nearly always available) was a highlight. Attentive but discreet service, good wine list. Overall difficult to fault. The only way I could see that you might be disappointed is if you were looking for quantity...this isn't the place for large slabs of meat etc

I totally agree with previous reviewers about the quality of the food and the wine. The outstanding feature of this restaurant is the friendly and welcoming manner of the patron and his staff. Nicolas welcomes everyone personally, cooks the food, answers the phone and manages to do it all without seeming stressed. Of course, he has a sous chef to help with the food and attentive waiting staff all of whom work together to make the experience a pleasure for the diners. They called a cab for us too at the end of the evening. I thoroughly recommend this restaurant and expect to return when I am next in Singapore

I went here a couple of weeks ago for a wine tasting dinner and was seriously impressed by the food, so I went back with the missus for a good dinner before she jets off to Blighty for a 3 week business trip.I rocked up slightly early and had a very good glass of Muscadet-Sevre-et-Maine while I amused myself with the menu and wine list. Aforesaid missus was running a bit late so I had a second glass and selected a 2009 Chambolle-Musigny from the impressive array of Burgundies on offer.Once my wife had arrived and was settled, we studied the tasting menu and she opted for the aged Angus tenderloin while I plumped for the venison.We explained my eating foibles (no seafood) so Chef Nicolas changed the first two courses for me, which was good of him at such short notice.Of the 4 starters, which were all excellent, the stand-outs were the steamed hen's egg served in its shell with a tartine of Iberico ham, and the Provencale ravioli in a mushroomy emulsion, superbly flavoured, great. I had a great morsel of pigeon breast as a substitute for one of the prawny starters, and I may have that as my main course next time - there will be a next time!The tenderloin was perfectly cooked as was my venison, "rose" and simply but elegantly presented with a swoop of pumpkin puree.A trio of desserts to finish, a delightful tart lemon er, tart was my favourite but they were all good.I liked the fact that Chef Nicolas came and chatted to his guests, I use the word deliberately as that's how it felt, and the staff were friendly but polite and knew their business, very good and sadly rare to find here.Overall a great dinner and although not cheap, it was great value for the money

After walking around with a group of hungry,tired and borderline angry people, we stumbled upon this nice little place in the outskirts of Chinatown. The manager/chef, which I presume is Nicolas, went out of his way to make a table ready for a group of 8 without a reservation on a friday night. Their set menu is reasonably priced at 78$ with additional $12 for choosing the Angus beef for the main course, which was well worth it. Every course was beautifully prepared and was very delicious. Would greatly recommend a visit to this charming place

Nicolas is tucked in Teck Lim Rd, off Keong Siak Road. The food is special because their ingredients are from France and Chef Nicolas is the one who cooks the food.He will come out to chat with his diners . It is a personalized treatment, like eating at his home

Decided on this place for lunch due to its high ranking here and was curious. They claimed to have been around for 7 years (and not increased their price) but the reviews here only started 7 months ago. HmmAnyway, this is a very small restaurant with low chairs that don't quite adjust well to the table height. They have a 4 and 6 course lunch and we opted for the former as we were in a hurry. Both seemed to be good value. They serve good duck roulette with bread at the start. My starter of egg with iberico ham was a little underwhelming , i expected more wow but got sort of half boiled or poached eggs instead. My friends' scallops seem ok. My main of venision tenderloin was good. My friends had the cod which look good too. Dessert was a "surprise" of vanilla ice cream, a chocolate dessert and a very sweet tart. The tart was really too sweet. Ended with very normal pralines and tea/coffeethis place serves authentic french food without too much reinvention and creativity. I do like real food, but sometimes wish they put more pizzazz and effort into the design and ingredient

had the new year's eve menu... apart from the desserts -- which i thought it was ordinary... every other dish is fantastic... even the bread and crackers which are just the free starters..! so it's kinda anti-climax when the dessert didn't match up with the mains...but still... there are restaurants where i've eaten 1 or 2 extremely memorable dishes... at nicolas... almost EVERY dish is very special and memorable... at $88++/pax for a new year eve's dinner... it's well worth the $$$..

We ate at Nicolas's restaurant as a party of three. The restaurant is not large, but comfortable and not intimidating. It's located in Teck Lim road, in an old "China-town" area. We choose the 'A La Carte' menu: choice of one starter, and one main course, with and three desserts. Wines are available by the glass, and are predominantly French. Portions were reasonably sized (but not generous - don't expect a feast!), and presented nicely without being overly fussy. All the dishes we tried ranged from very good to superb, with highlights being the rack of lamb and Iberico Presa pork. In general, the main courses were the highlight of the dinner. We were also offered a cheese course, but most of us declined. The only slight disappointment was the coffee - not strong or fragrant enough for my caffeine-fueled self.Service was friendly and efficient, without the sort of condescension that you sometimes encounter at upmarket places.Highly recommended for a special night out
