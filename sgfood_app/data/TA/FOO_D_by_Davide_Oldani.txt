Very nice restaurant, in the nicest area of the city. Excellent dinner, great quality materials and creative cuisine. Very friendly service, good wine list at reasonable prices. One of my best dinners in Singapore

Visited for the weekend brunch whilst visiting SG on recommendation by my son. Wow we were not disappointed- beautifully presented courses of delicious Italian food to excite you. Service also impeccable- discrete and attentive. Will return on our next visit from London.

Some hits and some misses but overall well executed dishes. Could do better with plating as while aesthetically pleasing it was impossible to grab some of the food from the dishes used.

If a restaurant’s venue adds to the experience, Foo’d gets of to a great start. Housed in the beautiful Victoria theatre its outward grandeur is matched by a spacious and modern design within. The food was equally beautifully presented and matched by great flavours. The four course lunch special offers two choices of starters along with a soup and a dessert (all at a very reasonable 52++). I opted for the asparagus and poached egg starter with taleggio and black truffle; the creamy taleggio sauce had a delicious cheesy flavour that wasn’t overpowering, but when mixed with the perfectly prepared poached egg and fragrant truffle, it was mouthwatering combo. As a bit of food swapping was going on , I also tried he octopus starter which was artistically presented and tasted soft, yet still firm enough to have a nice texture. Next came te creamy mushroom soup which was also presented very well by being poured over some steamed whole mushrooms. The grilled seafood dish came next and although it wasn’t as spectacular as the previous starter it was well presented and tasty. Cooked with subtle flavours that complimented the texture of prawns and fish without disguising it. Of all the dishes the dessert was good rather then great, a nice mango pana cotta with pineapple chunks and lime zest. Overall the meal was well balanced, tasty, not overly filling, but packed with different and delicate tastes at every turn. The service was generally polite and efficient, although one guest was missed while ordering and some cutlery was missing before one of the courses. But that’s just nit-picking as all in all it was a great lunch. I think I’ll be back to try the omakase menu

This was out second visit since last July. The first time was perfect, food was amazing with great value. Creative presentation with high quality ingredient. We have kept missing it until we were able make it again last weekend. The price has increased by 15%, which we knew it in advance, but we still want go since the food was way too attractive. But, the menu changed so much and all the costly ingredients almost disappeared. Seafood, beef and my favorite smoky duck. They replaced it by honey duck which I didn't want to order again. To that extent. All the portion were smaller which was fine since you can order again. But you feel, the feeling is not good when you see the size shrank so much. I will not go again, very sad that suddenly I lost my favorite restaurant but good thing,like is I don't need to diet so much for a meal in the future.

Italians love eating, cooking, talking about food since ever (way before this was 'mainstream'). Being and Italian in Singapore I sincerely appreciated the establishment of Foo'd. Quality drive, prepared Crew, First Class Chef Simone De Palmas nested in the renewed Victoria Concert Hall makes a real difference. Among the huge plethora of pretentious players in Italian restaurants Foo'd deserve a very high ranking. Definitely suggested. Keep up the good work guys

Had the weekend omakase and it was an amazing experience. It was 14 courses on that day and its all-you-can-eat. Comes in taster sized portions so you can try all and decide which ones you like the most. My favourites were: foie gras, cauliflower soup, risotto and beef cheek.Staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about the food and building (it is in a beautiful colonial era part of town). Elegant surroundings inside, but I popped outdoors for dessert so I could enjoy the view of the National Gallery, Cricket Club and Singapore Flyer. Great value for SGD 52! Sadly I was too full to order a second round of my faves.

Was told by a friend that they serve (omakase)12 course lunch for $52.00 only on Saturday.Italian cuisine, nice ambient upon sitted chef came around greeted guest.Not a bad deal for this omakase food presentation also good.Quite a good portion and at the end of the meal a waitress csme and ask if we like any of the the dish they will serve us more.We were surprised at this gesture, we said it will be great if our meal include coffee or tea. The reply they do hsve hot drink but charge separately.We joking said free ok pay no, then came the manager after some conversation he said he try snd see what he can do.Then we were served a pot of free tea, he really make our day and we feel so complete with the hot tea.The extra service and flexibility will definitely bring in more business, We then book another date to bring families.Understand they now open on sunday.To the manager good job

Nice ambience with great foods & service.
1) crispy prawn with ginger sauce
2) potato leek,watermelon,roasted octopus
3) beef short ribs
Above 3 are my favourite.
5
Value for money. Every course was a delight. Wine selection focuses on Italian. It's a well-selected list.
5
We have always enjoyed its weekend Omakase lunch. The lamb was made perfectly. We will definitely return again.
5
Atmosphere was great as the restaurant sits in a museum. Interior was pleasant to be in. Food was even better. Loved the sea bass and the desserts were superb. Can't stop thinking about the lychee creme brûlée!!!
4
The service was excellent. The ambience is nice, great dining place for couples. Love the wine they recommended.
3
The restaurant is quite nice. We went for the omakase lunch.Food was not bad, but served a little too slow even though there were just about 5 tables around.Desserts were a little disappointing though.Bad point was we felt that they were quite pushy about their alcoholic drinks. We told them we didn't want to drink alcoholic beverages since it was a lunch, but they continued to tell us about their bespoke cocktails service so we just ordered 1 so that they could leave us alone
5
We went to FOO'D for a friend's birthday and it didn't disappoint. The presentation of each dish was impeccable and well thought out. The spread was a good range: we had things from foie gras mousse and black truffle to beef short rib and excellent seared salmon. For what you get, the weekend all you can eat omakase lunch is extremely affordable!
5
We are vegetarian and most Italian restaurants only offer us few options. Foo'd was a completely different experience - we had the Omakase menu and the chef delighted us with creative creations...we had a wonderful meal and the chef personally came and checked in with us several times...overall, very good attention to service and great food
5
This is a superb restaurant.Fantastic food combinations, and great service combine to make eating here a real occasion.We had the 5 course Degustation menu which I’d recommend, as it allows you to try a wide selection of dishes.Chef Simone came out to chat with us, and was happy for us to change any items on the menu, at every course he came to see us, talk about the recipe and check we were happy- fantastic service.Even the cutlery and glasses have a story behind them, which I will leave for the waiters to tell when you visit.Fully recommended, we will be back again...
4
Had 13 courses of wonderful produce served in very interesting formats. What's even better, if you love the dish so much you could ask for it again right before they fire the desserts. Chef Davide himself was greeting everybody present on the very busy F1 weekend. It was also my partner's birthday, and the staff were sweet enough to bring out a slice of cake.Wonderful dinning fine dinning experience at very affordable prices, must try
5
Food was great! The chef actually came out to have chats with us and making sure that we are ok with the food and service. Would definitely return to try other dishes.
4
Really cannot complain at all for 52++ for free flow omakase brunch. Hits and misses but overall pretty awesome. Will definitely be back
5
We had the Saturday omakase for $48++ - 8 courses with unlimited repeat. The food was delicious and price was great value. Add to that the setting was great. Will definitely be back, and try the free flow Prosecco too.
4
My first time here and I had omakase lunch with 3 friends. The food was beautifully presented and we enjoyed the majority of items on the menu (13 items!). Good value for money
4
It has hits and misses, but is overall worth the checking out. Desserts are not strong. Very pleasant service.

We were there for a couples weekend lunch getaway from the kids and was very impressed with the ambience being our first time. Perhaps we already started off wrong as hubby was put off by the purple potato dish, too cheesy for a start and we could not really taste any foie gras in it though it was very beautifully set on a plate with the polenta and frog leg tempura. Those 2 appetizers were fine but not seriously blown away still....Next on the pumpkin soup, it was light with a tinge of ginger and served with a few slices of grilled octopus. Nice offset to the cheesiness of the potato. The 2 dishes that followed - Gnocchi and Marsala were refreshing combination of different ingredients. Also, the next 2 dish - Branzino (sea bass) and Beef cheek were cooked to perfection! Hence, hubby reordered the Branzino as well as the beef cheeks again! Unfortunately, it did not taste the same the second time round. The beef cheeks were overcooked and the Branzino I had had a bone in it (about 1cm)! I informed one of the staff (in grey suit) about the bone and he mentioned that he will feedback to the kitchen. That was all there is on the Michelin Star service (or none!) that we were expecting. Totally disappointing! Though the meal is truly value for money and the place is nearly full by the time we left, I truly hope that the management is able to better train the kitchen (QC) and service staff.
5
Housed in the historic Victoria Concert Hall, this spacious restaurant has an alfresco area for drinks and offers fine dining sets in generous potions at very reasonable prices. Matched with attentive service and helpful recommendations by restaurant manager, this is definitely one of the best pre-concert meal in town
5
My friend and I had the Saturday omakase lunch for her birthday. The staff were lovely, friendly and attentive. They even brought us a special birthday surprise! The restaurant is beautiful and yet the atmosphere is unpretentious. Chef Simone Depalmas is so humble and greets all his patrons personally and even asked us why we didn't finish some dishes (paiseh) but honestly it was cause we were way too full by the 4th appetizer. He was even gracious enough to let us take a picture with him! The staff explained each dish to us and every course was exciting. It is amazing affordable as well. I would definitely come back to try their weekday course menus. I would love to thank the team for making this day so special for us, it was the best dining experience I had in Singapore this summer
5
Having read all the good reviews, I decided to try this restaurant with my colleagues during lunch. We really enjoyed the food.. good quality ingredients served with impressive presentation and taste. I must say we were very impressed with the service staff too who were all very attentive and gave their best in service. It was also great that the chef came around the tables to greet the diners. Ambience was nice.. classy and romantic. I will definitely be back again for a romantic dining experience here!

This is our "go-to" for a dinner prior to a show at the Victoria Theatre - super convenient as it is in the Victoria Theatre!. A return visit, I was really looking forward to their entree caramelised tartlet, however it wasn't as good as the first time. It was simply over-done - borderline burnt so was disappointed - sorry! Perhaps next time we will try the ala'carte menu instead of the pre-theatre offering - oddly the ala'carte menu wasn't even offered to us and we had to ask for it. If you ask for soup, request the bread - they only bring this afterwards with the main
5
I visited the restaurant last Saturday for Omakase lunch ,is my second visit in this restaurant,absolutely one incredible experience ,for the food quality,for the food presentation,for the great service staff, for the Chef who takes care of you,
This restaurant is absolutely Michelin star level
5
Service staff was attentive, head chef was warm and friendly. Unique dishes that delighted our tastebuds :)
5
Value for money 💰Omakase lunch on Saturday
Exquisite quality and variety of gourmet
Excellent service and servers, including friendly Chef who goes round chatting with guests
Perfectly classy ambience
Highly recommended!!
5
Excellent food combinations be it for taste and texture, very good presentation and service; overall nothing we did not enjoy... even the bread and butter were excellent ;-)
Looking forward to our next visit...
5
Beautiful interior, unique food, impeccable service! My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our visit and will definitely be back for more.
5
Overall very pleasant experience! The staffs were all very attentive and knowledgeable. Food was very nice, even the cutlery was very interesting.
5
Very friendly staff and our wonderful server was Christine. We had the most amazing and intimate dining experience. Soft music so conversations can be heard. Brilliant and eye popping food presentation.
2
Granted I dined alone but there was very little atmosphere for a Saturday night. There was limited options on the menu, especially for pre-theatre. The food was very heavy/rich and felt quite uncomfortable after. Some lighter and more healthier options would be preferred, especially if attending a show afterwards. The food appeared to be pre-prepared as well. Had hoped for something more special in such a beautiful location
5
Had ala carte dinner before our Boeing Boeing show. I must say we thoroughly enjoyed the food n service rendered to us by the professional n friendly staff. Assistant chef made an effort to come to us to explain the meals. Food was very good n tasty .Nice embience n will definitely go back again. Special thanks to staff Furhan ( hope spelling is correct ), Christina n Uncle Foo ever so smiley he told us his niece was the owner hence Foo'd combined with the chef's name. Highly recommended!
5
I've been here twice and both times I'm stunned by the creativity of the chefs and the wonderful service. Every dish made us feel a new experience, even something familiar like smoked duck was executed in a way that made us look at it through different eyes. It's amazing value for such high quality and I'm shocked they're not fully booked all the time. Do not hesitate - the Saturday afternoon omakase menu is a steal. You get to try 10 dishes and then reorder any number of those you liked. I've not had a single bad plate here. Not even a mediocre plate. Everything is good. I'm definitely coming back.
5
Unforgettable experience especially when chef came by twice to chat with us. Definitely recommended and will be returning there very soon
4
The ambiance is good and the cutlery is interesting. As for the food, the taste of the starter is nice, we love it. The staff are polite and friendly. Overall we are happy with the service and foods.
4
Food was good, especially tomato starter and coffee flavoured risotto. Ambience nice, but please take away the LCD screens
5
My dad and I had dinner here as part of the pre-concert dinner tie up with the Tang Tee Khoon grand series Beethoven the Heroic years. I informed the staff that my dad was diabetic and they kindly arranged an alternative dessert for him - a fruit platter with pineapple sorbet. This was really going above and beyond their duty as they could easily have said that the menu was fixed. The food and service were extremely commendable. My dad and I had a really lovely experience
5
Finding food convenient before a show/play/opera tends to be more about convenience ahead of that performance start time, and always has that "rush it along" feeling. As restaurant "Food", shares the building of the Victoria Theatre, it is absolutely breathtaking, 3 floor height towering ceilings, Landro sculptures, opulent crisp white column elegance - the dramatic interior you would have thought yourself dining in the Italian location of the John Wick II movie.I like it when your visual is messing with your head and the starter looked like a dessert (tart tartin onion w quenelle of cream fraiche) - gets you taste buds intrigued and you cant wait to dive in. We had a three and a two course pre-performance menu and between both of us tried every dish. Every morsel was absolutely sensational. Presented beautifully, perfect serving momentum, suited size portions (not big eaters) with new flavours and textures. The silkiest smooth pumpkin soup, with a perfect poached egg was scrummy. The crayfish risotto with the pistachio nut crumble for me was to die for - I like mains that tend to be lighter. Def would not share the onion tartlet next time!. I loved the entire menu - my small appetite was actually salivating for more! Michelin Star delicious.We arrived 6:15pm, and with the Victoria theatre entrance being literally one step (you can see show goers buying programmes) it makes for a v relaxing and easy dining experience where both culture and food can feature. It felt like we had two events in the evening out. We may have walked out of the play, but strolling along this restaurant made our night. And as you cant guarantee how you like a performance/show, I can reassure you won't be disappointed by Restaurant Foo'd.This is our "go-to" place before any Victoria Theatre performance
5
My friend and I had the 4 course lunch set. Both ordered different dishes.All dishes were beautifully presented. The chef came to have a chat. Super friendly and enthusiastic.Apparently they change their menu every 2-3 months.I especially love the risotto with aged rice! Yums!Must go!
5
Ordered the ala carte menu for dinner at FOO'D by Davide Oldani. For starters, I had the signature 20 months aged Grana Padano Ice Cream Onion Tart, which was amazing - the Onion was caramelised and topped with the salty Grana Padano ice cream - good balance and also tried the Alaskan King Crab salad. Had a pasta main course which was pretty affordable - less than 30 dollars. This place looks fancy but is actually pretty affordable! Perfect to hang out with friends! Service at FOO'D is one of the better ones in Singapore, staff are attentive, friendly and helpful. Go for the Saturday Omakase Lunch which is one of the most affordable weekend brunch/lunches in Singapore - SGD 48 for a 12 course menu and unlimited dishes!
5
I had the opportunity to try Oldani's new restaurant in Singapore over a business lunch and the overall experience was up to the mark. We found service being flawless and waiters very professional and well prepared in explaining you each course. Food was an exquisite experience: I had the tasting menu and each course was unique and very good.On a side note, it was a very convenient price if compared with great quality. Only downside to me was the ambiance design which was not up to the mark if compared with the cusine
5
Went for dinner on a Saturday with my family.Ordered the pre-theatre menu ($10 off if you can show your ticket).Portions are not large - so it may not fill your tummy if you are a big eater.The caramelised onion with cheese and dessert (lemon meringue and lettuce gelato) were outstanding.Service was very good. Highly recommende

I had wanted to visit Foo'd after hearing my friend's experience. They offer an excellent value 13 course Omakase menu on Fridays & Saturdays for lunch at Sgd 56 including tax. Some courses were standouts like the straciatella with tomato gelato, the iced lardo with honey & toasted polenta as well as the duck roulade with truffle jus. The portions though small do add up but I'm glad I visited the restaurant when I'd. To finish there were a number of small desserts but all I really craved was the refreshing green Apple sorbet which was just the right ending I sort. Some of the other dishes didn't quite make the mark such as the risotto of year old rice with red wine reduction & sour dough crumbs. I felt it was too heavy and the crumbs caught on the back of my throat but I give the chefs full marks for trying. The setting in the elegant Victoria Concert Hall was wonderful & I'd certainly return again.
4
Good variety, nice ambience and attentive service. good choice for mates or family gathering. Omakase menu is pretty comprehensive at decent pricing.
4
Lovely ambience, attentive and personable service and yummilicious food
Nice to see Chef walking around meeting and greeting guests
5
Still relatively quiet since it's new but I'm sure it's going to be a big hot soon! Better chope before you have to start queueing!
5
Food was excellent. Nice fusion.
The chef personally talked to us and explained us the food and it was extremely tasty.
Everything else was also top class
5
My husband and I went to Foo'd for the Omakase brunch. $48 I think for a free-flow of delectable mouthfuls bursting with flavour. The owner and chef, made a point of speaking to each and every diner to explain his menu and general food philosophy and to ensure that we were all happy with what he was serving us. A thoroughly likeable chap with real passion for his food - everything is super fresh, each dish has a great balance of flavours and textures. A real steal at just $48 - anywhere else you would expect to pay twice this. In case you needed any stronger an endorsement, my husband and I are booked up there for the next 3 Saturdays! I wish Chef Oldani all the very best, he truly deserves it.
5
My wife and I went to Foo'd by chance. We saw it a couple of times on the first floor of Victoria Hall and decided to pop in for a meal. We were definitely impressed by the atmosphere, the service, the quality of the food and variety of the wine. It is a good choice and we will bring friends there in the future
3
I heard about this place from my friend, and visited them for my business lunch. Positive elements were ambience (high ceiling and unusual setting) and dessert. However I found that most of food and service were mediocre. As one time experience, it was alright. But if anybody asks me whether I will go back again, perhaps my answer is negative
5
On my last visit to Singapore i visited Foo'd by David Oldani for Saturday Omakase Special, From the minute i walked in i was very impressed, the restaurant is gracefully located at Victoria Concert Hall and has an elegant classy ambiance.Greeted by professional staff, the service was very attentive from the minute i walked in. You would be able to tell, that the staff were carefully trained in a fine dining standard. My attending waiter explained on how to use the glass as well as the history of the unique creation by Davide himself of Sforknife (a spoon which is crossed with fork and knife, 3 in 1 cutlery), When serving meal he would also explained each course thoroughly in a very graceful yet professional manner. Every each of my course was stunningly presented like a work of art, and tasted absolutely amazing!! When i see the menu i was genuinely excited to try each of the dishes that i had. I remember the course menu being set up as creative yet attractive for my liking! Although i enjoyed all the dishes, i must say i was very impressed with the Pistachio, Crayfish, Coffee, year old rice as well as the Caramelised Onion with Grana Padano (absolutely a joy of a dish).Overall it was a simply exceptional dining experience, reasonably priced, outstanding service. I will definitely be back for the 7 course degustation dinner very soon.Ps : Coffee was excellent too
4
the setting is elegant in an old historic building and the food is very good, the carmelized onion was a favourite. I guess it is early days and people have yet to take note of the place. It was extremely quiet on a Friday night. It didn't matter to use as we were with great friends, but I am sure to others it was an issue. The service was attentive and informed
4
An amazing meltingly sweet and sticky onion tart followed by gnocci with prawns and salmon roe. Lovely dessert of lemon curd/meringe with unusual and delicious lettuce ice cream on a chocolate crumb. The only minus was that I was the only person eating lunch and the restaurant feels as though it's been carved out of the large entrance hall but that wouldn't put me off returning. Chef and staff were charming and that onion tart is a must-have
5
The food was presented in a exquisite manner for every dish. Dessert was lovely. Ambience was lovely. Service was impeccable. They even remembered to prepare a cake with candle for my friend celebrating his birthday! We enjoyed our food very much!
4
Good experience tho the place is somewhat a little quiet . Great food for 8 course meal . Ambience is fine dining in a colonial building
3
Food is decent, some hits and misses, and drinks were good. However, need to check one is correctly billed.
5
Housed in a beautiful heritage building Victoria Concert Hall is a new restaurant FOO'D by Michelin Chef Owner Davide Oldani. We arrived to cheerful warm greeting. Restaurant is so beautiful with high ceiling,white interior,beautiful columns, tasteful decor except for the two tv screens please remove !! We sat at terrace for happy hour drink one to one till 8pm, very nice bourbon by the way ! 5 course dinner reasonably priced at S$138++ per pax. Exquisite menu creation and staff explains every dish when serving. Dessert was an interesting item that looks like Singapore's icon Esplanade and staff informed indeed Chef Oldani was inspired by Esplande and created this lemon curd, what an innovation and paired with Lettuce Ice Cream !! Wow daring but so nice as it tastes more like matcha. Love the warm service, staff are very professional and make our dining experience so wonderful ! Executive Chef Simone is so friendly and warm too ! great dining experience and highly recommend !
3
Had the pre theater menu and it offered decent value for money with good flexibility around options of starters, mains and desserts (choice of 2 or 3 course with any combination). The highlight was the onion starter (nicely charred while moist) but the beef cheeks mains were dry and gamey (sauce was good but insufficient). Service was competent. Good option for pre show meals and wouldn't mind returning as the restaurant refines its offerin
4
We had a pre Theatre/Concert meal here on Friday 24th which is good value. Set menu. You get an extra discount if you have tickets to an evening performance which we did (and what a brilliant concert too -SSO and Beethoven). Restaurant opens at 6. This is a really good idea and will in time attract concert and theatre goers once word gets around I'm sure. This is a beautiful setting but why put in two huge flat screens and spoil it? Hideous. We chose the famous onion and cheese starter which is one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. Crunchy buttery pastry, sweet onions and a gorgeous cheese cream on the top. Outstanding. My main course of beef cheek was tiny and dry. The polenta was a minuscule polenta wafer when I was expecting warm soft polenta. That was disappointing. One mushroom to accompany the meat?! My husband's risotto was very good and he enjoyed it. I'm glad we were served (good quality) bread as we were still hungry. We had some time - smooth unhurried service - so we decided to change from a 2 course menu to a 3 course menu and enjoy the chocolate pudding. We were told it would take half an hour to defrost and we were offered the lemon pudding which we declined. What a rookie error for such a grand restaurant. Tell diners this or put it on the menu! So - I would try it only if you can take advantage of a set menu deal. This is a very expensive restaurant even by Singapore standards. I have given 4*s rather than 3*s because I don't think I have ever had a better starter - highly recommended.
5
I visited the restaurant last Friday,It 'was recommended by friendsThe location is beautiful , service is Friendly,but it could be betterThe food is great and the service by the Chef Amazing,He did visit the restaurant after dinner,making the most interesting experiencedefinitely be back soo
3
The decor of the venue is great and inviting. However, the place is quite inaccessible especially when it is raining. No nearby covered drop off or pick up area. Went for lunch, thought the food was great though wasnt enough to make you fell full after. The vegetarian option is quite disappointing but for the other option, the chicken was nicely cooked and flavoured well
5
We are Italian and we live in Singapore, we had an excellent dinner, very nice location and the quality of the food was excellent . I strongly recommend this place, both for business and private dinner . Chef Simone is extremely professional and friendly. Great staff as well ! Must try it !! Buon appetito
2
We had the valentine's day menu and the food was way below expectation. Only one dish out of 8 dishes was acceptable. Quality was bad, service was average. Oyster served was room temperature and not cold. Definitely not worth $188 per person.
