Need to add more variety of food choices. But over all the view was fantastic my husband enjoyed the sashimi. The service was good.
5
Love their selection of oysters from many different countries. Fresh seafood and lots of choices in the hot food section. Great value for money.
5
One of better restaurants in the Singapore.Setting is impecable and very smart looking.People dress up for this restaurant.Food is amazing and service rounds it all up !
5
I went there with my wife and my 11 month old daughter, we had a warm welcome from the staff.
The place is calm and luxious.
I recomand it.
5
The food are nice and many choices. Love the desserts. The staffs are friendly. One of the staff ask me wanna have some tea to go along with the cakes.Nice environment. Would love to be back again.😊

This buffet is inside the Carlton Ritz Hotel, so the setting was beautiful, modern and high-end like.Cold fresh seafood selection was plentiful and filled up regularly.Hot fried, soup and cooked selection was delicious.To top it off drink selection like fresh apple/ orange juice was nice

My wife and I went to Colony for a Valentine's Day Dinner last week, and it exceeded our already high expectations. Colony is one of our favourite restaurants, and it never gets old or fails to surprise. As good as the food and ambience are, what really makes it stand out is the staff. On this last evening Mr. Lim Beng Kuan really made us feel special and well looked after. He was friendly, professional and knowledgeable, and we really appreciated his service. Mr. Retish's staff always impresses us, and that's what my wife and I think is the key part of a 5-Star experience
5
We celebrated valentine's day over a dinner at Colony and am very pleased with the whole experience. They have a large variety of food to choose from their buffet spread. Service was excellent, we had Devi who was very accommodating to our every request. She is someone who definitely deserves recognition for her vigilance and assistance. We definitely will be back.
5
Went there with my boyfriend to celebrate Valentine's Day in advance and we were very impressed by the selection and taste of food, the beautiful decor and the amazing service. Please save your stomach for the sweet seafood and tasty desserts! Special mention to the staff Sally and Nina who were so attentive and gifted us mocktails and dessert after knowing that we were there to celebrate V-Day :) really made both our day and made this experience even more unforgettable
5
Everything was outstanding
Must go in Singapor.
I have never seen such a fantastic buffet bevore. Service was very good as well.
3
For a weekend night buffet, there is NO wow. Not even lobster on ice. It’s just a normal theme buffet. No quite worthwhile.
5
Good variety. Nice mains and seafood. Dimsum can skip though
Great place for celebration. Expensive tho
5
Beautiful ambience and fantastic food for the price. Thanks to Mr Ben(from Colony) who attended us with full service and a big smile always. Cheers buddy
Will be back soon.
5
Thanks Chope and Colony restaurant. I left a note while I made the booking at Chope, stating the dinner was to celebrate my Husband birthday (: and I’m glad that the message was delivered to Colony. They’ve arranged a cake and wished him happy birthday during the dinner. Staffs were very observant and greeted customers with smile. We very much enjoyed the dinner. Thank you

I have stayed at the Ritz-Carlton on a number of occasions over the years. Totally love the hotel. Each time I stayed, I was in an Executive Room, so I dined in the wonderful Executive Lounge.This time in Singapore, for reasons I won't go into, my wife and I stayed in the Swissotel The Stamford. However, we decided that we would like to eat at The Colony on one of our dinners. I made an online reservation, some weeks before we left the UK, to ensure we would be accommodated.When we arrived at The Colony, I was surprised by how busy it was and how close the tables were to each other. Maybe I should have read a little more about the restaurant, before I booked?The food selection was very extensive and we sampled things we hadn't eaten before. All very tasty.Because the restaurant was very busy, the table service in clearing plates, refreshing cutlery, bringing fresh glasses was lacking finesse. In fact, a couple of times, we couldn't attract the attention of the wait staff, so I sought out the assistance of a supervisor.Overall, the experience, wasn't what we were expecting. We certainly weren't wowed. But looking at the bill, we certainly should have been

My Wife and I booked the lunch buffet as part of our honeymoon visit to Singapore. Generally the food was quite good for a buffet, only for it to be quickly spoilt by the following incident; I carried a glass of juice back to our table and the bottom of the glass literally ‘fell off’ which resulted in an entire glass of juice all over the table, sunglasses, clothing and drenched my Iphone. It was explained to us that this happened because the staff pre-wash the glasses in hot water and then pour cold liquid in them while the glasses are still hot. Therefore they crack and break. Not only is this dangerous, it’s extremely silly and sounded like it had happened before. Although Raj the supervisor was very apologetic, we only received a mere 15% off our expensive bill, which we felt was quite insulting given how reputable and expensive the hotel is. We don’t normally give a bad review to a restaurant, but after spending our lunch wondering if my iphone was permanently ruined, we were rather shocked at how little was done to compensate us for this
4
The buffet brunch was excellent. The choices were wide ranging and a definite threat to the waistline! It is the perfect venue for family celebrations. The service is great and the decor luxurious. Possibly the only drawback is the location of the various "food stations". It was a bit confusing.They are widely spaced and, given the large number of people enjoying the Sunday Brunch, sometimes they were difficult to find. We had a fabulous meal but left wondering if we had seen everything, perhaps there was yet another food/cuisine offering tucked into a corner?
5
I’ve been to Colony twice already and was impressed with the quality of the food, varieties and service they had provided, but my second visit on the 20th Jan 2018 took the cake when Sally(One of their waitresses) go out of her way to request Chef Ang to cook their delicious plate of Salted Egg Chicken Wings especially for us when she overheard us being so disappointed as it was not available that day, our table was overwhelmed with happiness as Sally and Colony service staffs continue to provide us with the best quality service. To end my review I would honestly say that I wish I can give Colony 10 stars instead of 5 as my experience there is beyond excellent! And I’m not going to write a recommended dish/dishes cause everyone should try abit of everything :DP.s. for everyone that read my review, the salted egg chicken is truly awesome! :
5
I was last here in July last year with my family, this visit last night was with a friend.Once again the choices and quality of the food was superb. We spent over four hours here and took our time, the service is second to nowhere in Singapore. Special thanks to Darren our waiter and Rethish the manager, they remembered me from my last visit which was very welcoming. This buffet menu is great value and you will no be disappointed, good for families or business people. can't wait for my next visit to Singapore so that I can return again
5
The Colony buffet restaurant at Ritz Carlton Millennia is a good choice for family and business dinning. Nice ambience. Good tasting food. Value for buck. Highly recommend the buffet.
5
Went here with wife and friends,there is a lot of choice,all Singapore region food but my favorite was the Indian.Go with a big appetite it is all you can eat!
5
Another great lunch - Darren, Connie, Clarissa and Devi and the team looked after us so well.
Always to be recommended.
Will be back again.
5
Possibly the best buffet in the world but then we are biased we have come here most years since hotel opened in late 90’s. Food is great quality , staff are warm & friendly and the beverage package is v good value
5
Had dinner with friends at Colony and was blown away by the spread and quality of food on offer. Definitely takes more than a seating to try out everything. Freshly shucked oysters were brilliant, and so were the numerous live station items although some of the Oriental food offering at the buffet line can be improved, but that's just me being picky. Overall, as a buffet joint, Colony ranks high up in the places that I've been to
4
The buffet spread was very good especially the fresh oysters. It was a good mix of almost everything. The lobsters were really fresh. The food was good but they failed on the ambience. The tables were too close to each other that you can hear the conversations of the other guests. Coffee was badly served. They just gave us the cups with no accompanying saucer. But i would still recommend this restaurant for its excellent food
5
Colony at Ritz Carlton was rebranded from Greenhouse. It builds on the already high standard Greenhouse's buffet and the quality of the impressive spread is just remarkable. Notwithstanding the price is on the high side, dinners definitely get more than what they paid. Ambience is perfect too, with a mixed of open tables and private sofa settings. Truly a very impressive place
4
Great place for a friends gathering, quiet and classic decoration, easy to talk atmosphere. Comfortable sitting arrangements. Was there for weekend brunch, the latest menu comes with a tier set including Xiao Long Bao, abalone on bread etc. enough for an adult appetite. Free flow dessert, nothing unique about the desserts, favorite the gelato ice-cream.Servers were very friendly and warm, sometime could be slow and hard to get their attention. Wouldn't be a problem if you were not in a rush.In general is a good place to go to if you have a free afternoon for some girls chat
4
There's not many free flow Saturday evening buffets worth checking out these days but this is one of them.Starting at opening time 14 of us descend on Colony for my 43 birthday. It had been a few years since we had dropped in and I'm happy to say we were not disappointed.Food is great quality and varied for all tastes and if you buy the drinks package (39++) you can drink red, white, tiger beer and Processco all night long with your glasses always full.Definitely give this a go, ideal for large groups who fancy that intermate setting.
5
We stayed at the Ritz using Amex Fine Hotels and Resorts so we had the breakfast included. We went to Colony every day and the breakfast is outstanding. The selection is huge, both Western and Asian. The noodle soup station is my favorite, the curries, Indian food, dim sum, all were to die for. I did not try the western stations but the food coming out there looked super yummy.The place is big, and can get busy on weekends. Although we saw a line sometimes, the restaurant inside never felt crowded. There are very short lines only and the service is impeccable.The hostess knew my name after day one, I have no idea how she did that but I received a warm welcome every day
4
Good quality seafood and cooked food dishes! Loved the fruit juice station. Only thing is I think the dessert table is not as good as they used to be
5
Great food, great service, excellent and unprecedented variety of food - including all you can eat chilli crab, a BBQ meats stand and a cook to order pasta stand. Best buffet ever.
5
Colony has one of the best buffets in town- wide variety, great food quality and top notch service. Special shoutout to Mr Beng Kun for his wonderful service. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner last night, definitely coming back!
5
Just the right place, be it for biz meals or celebration.
Food spread is of quality standard and noteworthy is their high-level service, special mention of Ms Simran for her excellent customer service. Truly 'ladies and gentlemen serving ladies and gentlemen'. Thumbs up.
5
My fiancée brought me here for a simple champagne brunch for my birthday and it was the best so far!In terms of spread, fantastic! Quality wise?? superb! Best of all, service staff was very attentive and polite, very willing and happy to serve. Special mention to the manger, mr Rethish, who constantly came by to ensure our glasses were constantly filled and ensuring that we were well taken care of by even to the extend of explaining the drinks and food to us! Had a great time dining, Highly recommend!! Well done Ritz Carlton, we will be visiting again soon!
5
Colony was hand's down, the best brunch I've ever had in my life. The quality of the food and the variety did not disappoint at all. I was pleasantly surprised at how fresh the seafood were - make sure you get yourself some Lobster Eggs Benedict. There were plenty of options when it came to cheeses and cold cuts, which is always nice. Also, I got free flow champagne so can I complain?
5
Colony has the right ambience for couples’ afternoon high tea. I went there for my birthday celebration with my husband. Like the fact that they serve a glass of champagne to their high tea set to add to the celebration.Good food and great service! Highly recommended!
5
Food served at various stations will pleased the most demanding in term of quality and variety. A real culinary experience.Seating was comfortable.Surrounding noise could allow a business conversation without raising voice.Waiters were quick to remove empty dishes, replenish glasses and rearrange the table.Bill was accurate.We were so pleased that we returned for pleasure another day
5
This is my first time here with family and was impressed by its excellent service. All staffs were nice and always greet us with friendly smile. We would like to thank Mr. Lim Beng Juan for his genuine and prompt service. My mom is a vegetarian and i forgot to make certain request in advance but Mr Lim and the chef's arranged for us in a short time. He also explained the menu and drinks in details. We had a memorable experience here and highly recommend the afternoon tea in colony.Excellent service and great ambience. Thank you again to colony team and Mr Lim
5
I was here for on my birthday for lunch with my gf, when we went in we were totally wow by the interior design and the waitress who showed us our table asked if we were here for the first time and explain to us where the food station was and so on. The variety of the food was amazing and my gf enjoyed her snow crab very much :)The food here was really good, like the tortilla wrap, snow crab, laksa, oyster mee sua, they have the mini steak but it was very normal grilled meat. The dessert was a little disappointing as lots of it was yuzu and variety was pretty less. But all in all it was a really good experience and would highly recommend here for buffet. So far the best i have been to
5
First time here the ambient was great with excellent service. fresh seafood, sashimi and good food variety.
enjoy the dinner here will definitely back with family next time.
5
Highly commend on Ms Connie, she provided an excellent service to us.
Make our dinner very enjoyable.
Thank you.
5
Second visit to the restaurant, it was crowded but the service was great as usual. The spread of the buffet was great and the quality was within expectation. The dessert can be improved. Overall we enjoyed very much...
5
The wide selection of food from cheese varieties to mini international food stations to comfortable dining experience. Definitely a worthy buffet experience at a higher end of price.
5
Excellent service.. The seafood was very fresh and good quality. We enjoyed it very much. The only suggestion is that they should offer more dessert options..
5
Mr Lim made our dining experience very enjoyable. He was very attentive to our needs and needed no reminders to change our cutlery. He would change them without being asked! He went out of his way to make us feel comfortable and always had a smile on his face. Definitely one of the most caring service personnel! He makes me want to return to Colony! Thanks Beng Kuan!
5
Pros: +Lovely and Romantic ambience. +Table staff were attentive but not intrusive. +Variety and quality of food was worthy of the hefty price tag.  Cons:-Oyster and King Crab leg station was in high demand but the quantity available was often not enough.- Lighting was a bit too dim at the dining table we were at as we were seated at the fringes of the dining area.- Some items lack description tags or were not labelled correctly.
2
I wasn't sure if I should even write a review, but think maybe good for the restaurant to self reflect. There was an enormous cockroach running up one of the columns whereby my partner killed and squashed, it was right behind my parents, I would stay roughly a few inches away from our food. We spoke to the nearest staff after this incident and they were not very apologetic or sincere. We did not make a big fuss about it, but paying SGD100 per meal to have dinner in a restaurant with cockroaches is not ideal, we were not compensated in anyway and the staff did not return to tell us they will sort out this issue the restaurant is facing with - makes me think it's lacking in hygiene somewhere
3
Had a pretty good experience at colony for my dinner buffet, good variety and service. However, my experience for afternoon tea was ghastly. Not only was their spread one of the more limited ones I've ever tried, the service I was rendered was really lacking! It's weird that they were attentive to certain aspects (such as offering to switch us to another table so that we can have a quieter time), but totally negligent to others, more basic services such as not asking for our drink orders when we got seated and not asking/offering us the tiffin set AT ALL, until one of our friends who arrived almost 2 hrs after we first got seated got offered & served hers (only). We had to ask if we (the other 3 of us) can also order the tiffin set (and only then did the waitress express her surprise at having none of her colleagues offering to serve us the tiffin sets previously). Even when we got the attention of a waiter to ask if we can order drinks, and also ask what do they have on the menu, the waiter also couldn't be bothered to get a menu for us. Instead, he just half-heartedly replied, "we have soft drinks and juices..." And we had to ask him further if they serve coffee and tea, to which he merely replied, "Yes." and then we even had to ask further on what kind of tea they serve. Oh, they served hot cocoa too. He NEVER told us that. Really, really quite a nasty experience. Will never return here for high tea ever again
5
One of the best Sunday Brunches I have had. The fresh seafood is amazing, big lobsters, prawns, crabs and there are about 5 types of fresh oysters that were absolutely delicious. All The hot food stations should improve a bit more. I thought the roast beef was under cooked and cold, the Indian selection was quite poor and did not have the famous chicken tikka masala or naan bread made freshly as requested, like in many other Sunday brunches that we have been too. I did not eat anything from the Wok station, the chef behind had a flu and was sneezing heavily all over the place. I was very worried to get his bug on my holiday, but my husband did try the food. He said many dishes were over salted. The vintage champagne was good, but I have to say that we had a better non vintage rosé champagne at the club in the Pan Pacific Singapore hotel. The dessert was superb. I would give a special thumbs up for the crepe suzette, made fresh as requested. I will be back, but I will call before to double check if my comments were considered. I went on the 22 of October 2017.

A Feast fir the eye and heavy toll on the tummy as everything looks and taste great. My favorites are the roast pork and laksa plus fresh crab legs, prawns and scallops. Desserts simply too many choices but not complying though.
4
Quite a wide varieties of food choices. Love the atmosphere. Good for catching up with friends. Service staff are attentive to he needs of guest.
5
Good service , attentive staff who offers to clear the plates , and prompt service to requests for coffee or hot water.The spread for hot and cold food is wide ranging, good spread of soft drinks, iced teas and juices, hot food , cooked food, as well as good spread of cold appetisers and Japanese sashimi and sushi. Love the satay and sashimi.Deserts yummy and wished had bigger space for the food. Unfortunately could not . Would go agai
5
Wow - the only word to describe our experience at Colony Restaurant. From the moment we arrived, we were mesmerized by the decor and ambience. The service was impeccable, and the food was outstanding. The choices were immense. From salads, seafood, roasts, Mexican, Asian, Indian, to “die for” desserts and cheese boards, I could not fault this restaurant. My only gripe was having to pay $10 for a glass of coke. If you are wanting an experience to remember, and you don’t mind paying a bit more for it, this is the place to visit.
5
The setting and dinning environment is hard for any other to match in Signapore. Sea food is great, what is particularly worth mentioning is they carry a few great touch of authentic-traditional Chinese food, of course, sashimi is very nice as well. Look forward to next visit: weekend dinner
5
Service, decor, variety all excellent. Try it even if you’re not staying at the hotel. As hotel restaurants go this one is very special. Service was spot on and chefs go out of their way to please you and will cook something to order if you have special requests. The chefs are on had to explain about local dishes and how best to enjoy them which made the experience for us all the more enjoyable. It’s a buffet restaurant that wipes the floor with any restaurant that I’ve been to before. It’s a refined experience and I never thought that could be had at a buffet, so I guess that’s me told. Chapeau Ritz Carlton
5
The decor of the Colony restaurant is the most original I have seen anywhere. A historic photo gallery on the colonial theme is displayed in a most attractive and creative way. Excellent value afternoon tea with a glass of Moet, delicious savouries served in porcelain tiffin boxes and an unlimited sweets buffet with a live poppiah pancake station. This is not your classic English-style afternoon tea with cucumber sandwiches (although scones are available...) - Asian flavours of the savouries and the sweets are available alongside the more traditional offerings. Impeccable service with a smile. Will be back for another special occasion! The most memorable afternoon tea experience we've had
5
I’ve made a reservation at The Colony, 2 months before my mom’s birthday so I totally forgot that I’ve requested a small cake for her. Upon finishing our meal, the staff brought in their cake and my mom got surprised, she cried. It was a heartfelt gesture from their staff. By the way, the food is great!
5
Had dinner on Christmas eve at this restaurant and was not disappointed. Excellent serving staff, great ambience and the best buffet spread that I had. Good tasty and fresh food that's worthy of the Ritz Carlton name. Wonderful and attentive serving staff. Overall, a great place to have a celebration
5
I have been eating there for this Xmas eve dinner buffet. Me and my friend like the food. You have large choice of seafood and different oyster varieties which reminds me if my country. You will find other traditional food there from Indian, Chinese to western food. Do try the slice of wagyu beef if you can eat it. You will find different fruit juice near the main food as well and fruits. The desert are nice too but I have seen more choice in other place but I guess this is more than enough after eating so much. A real thanks to waitress, "petite mais costaud", Connie for her excellent service and always smiling face. We did enjoy our dinner there for Xmas since we couldn't go back home this year.
5
Great food, ambience and service. Loved the live food stations so food is freshly prepared. Good variety and spread too. Will definitely be back.
5
We were married at this hotel and return over and over. To our surprise the Colony was an improvement over the last iteration. Comfortable seating, well placed food stations loaded with good food and excellent service make the restaurant a star.
4
It’s rather small buffet restaurant and variety of selections is not Grand but I love the cozy ambience.
It’s a worth a visit if never been to Colony...
4
We were there for annual Xmas dinner for company. Meal was good with adequate variety. Service was excellent - in particular would like to thank Beng Kuan for his service.
5
great customer service, great food and the environment suits everything.
will recommend to my friends and definitely will come back again.
5
Best variety spread, love the Xmas decor. Will definitely come back again. Thank you Ritz Carlton for your 5-star service and hospitality.
5
Five Star International Buffet, with wide spread of seafood and not forgetting their dessert! Service staff were attentive and polite. Good ambiance, highly recommend.
3
Colony ranks as one of the top buffets in Singapore. The staff and ambience is excellent even at its peak. Although it can get very noisy, making conversations fairly difficult.The display and the quality of food is great. The down-side has to be its layout which means some stations can get extremely crowded
5
The spread and quality were very good. There's even a wide variety of oysters.I especially like the juice bar. The staff were friendly and attentive and even volunteered to take group pictures for us despite being so busy during the big crowd with lots of big company groups. Big Thank You to staff at The Colony.
5
First of all, the hostess was warm and polite. Already felt very warm hearted before we sat down in the restaurant.As always the spread of food is huge. There is always something for someone even those with the pickiest palate. The western food presentation is very elegant and made us feel like we are celebrating christmas in another country.The japanese food and chicken rice was amazing! A must try! Do not usually take much bread in a buffet spread but the focaccia was really nice and I was tempted to go for more
3
Visited the restaurant in the hotel for lunch. Was amazed looking at the variety of options for deserts on display. Very few vegetarian options to choose from infact on the day i visited there was only one vegetarian option available.
5
We had dinner at the Colony Restaurant and the sevice and food were brilliant. The range of food was amazing and the quality was first class. Well worth the cost! Recommend dining here, we will be back.
3
I'm not into a feeding frenzy type atmosphere. The foods okay for a buffet but that is what it is a buffet
1
Went here for a company xmas brunch and then spent the next ten days violently ill. 9 others from our party were also sick and had to miss work. Genuinely terrible experience and when we wrote to complain, Colony sent us all what can only be described as a pathetic gift basket. Frankly, given how sick i was, it didn't even come close to making up for the experience. Will never be back, and I'd advise anyone to steer clear..
5
We were still talking about the experience that we had in Colony's Vintage Sunday Brunch. It was an afternoon to remember for last Sunday's visit. The wide food variety, the top notch food quality, the spirit-uplifing atmosphere and engaging service has made the dining adventure wholesome! The chef and service team has made this possible and we are very appreciative. Every diners were well dressed and enjoying themselves. We first met Ms Erin when she offered the choices of vintage champagne. She took the effort to introduce herself, the afternoon's cocktail and the food that we should try. She checked on us and ensure that we are enjoying the afternoon. She may have joined the Ritz team for just six months or so, however she was professional, patient and engaging. To Ms Erin - thank you for your time and effort. Also, welcome to Singapore - the little red dot!
5
We went for a company lunch at the Colony on a Wednesday Afternoon.There is an amazing assortment of food being served, and the quality of all of the items are very high. We're talking about snow crabs that are sweet, and juicy roast meats and turkey. Sushi and sashimi are fresh, thickly sliced and tasty! The salad section is well-stocked and perfect for vegetarians.The dessert section is no slouch, with beautifully done cakes, ice creams and other sweet treats!The staff were both attentive and friendly. If you asked for anything at all, they will get it for you very quickly, and with a smile. I loved how they would unintrusively clear your plates and quickly bring you coffee if you asked them.At $58++ per person for weekday lunch, this is superb value for superb quality
5
Variety of food was great! From western to Asian to seafood to local fare, you name it, you get it. Quality of food was awesome for buffet standard. Good range of desserts too. Beautiful restaurant setting and queues were not too Long at the different food stations. Our family of 5 thoroughly enjoyed ourselves that night. Will be sure to visit again
5
Went for dinner with family to celebrate fatherâ€™s birthday. Selection was excellent with the 3 region oysters, also lobster, scallops served which is not available at lunchtime. Night time atmosphere very pretty and with Christmas around the corner the RC is all decked out. Food is well presented with service prompt as usual.
3
I feel it is overprice with the food selections and quality for buffet dinner. Desserts is poor, ice cream look pathetic with the size of scoop. Main entrance to Colony is not clear, took me some times to discover. And my friend got diarrhea after the dinner.
5
One of the best hotels it's restaurant offers the best dining experience ever! All types of cuisine are available for your taste buds. You won't get disappointed for any reason am sure.Comfort seating area with decor. Great customer service that you can get.Hotel values there customers as you expected. Hassle free stay with your love one.
5
This is the 4th time we have our buffet lunch in Colony. The food is one of the best among the buffets we been to. The cereal prawn, Mutton curry, Sashimi and more were nice beyond expection.
5
Wide selection of food with good quality. Good and attentive customer service accompanied with great ambience
5
Kudos to Colony for the excellent food and celestial service. Especially want to highlight Phil Park who attended to our every need and together with his fellow staff members ensured our dinner experience was wonderful.
4
We had a family lunch on Saturday, 2nd Dec at the Colony restaurant at Ritz Carlton. The Ambience is superb! The service also was very good. Special mention for Ms Gayatri, she was always there when we looked for coffee or tea or some other item. The food selection is delectable too
5
Making Colony my favourite and regular place for dinners has never been a choice I had regretted. Quality of food is always superior and the disposition of all the staff on the floor is exemplary. Always enjoy interacting with the interns (some familiar faces, some whom have completed their internship and have gone to further their ambitions).And of course, Ratish, the floor supervisor, Sundar from the Indian station and John from the Pasta station (Thank you for preparing the last portion of Mushroom truffle risotto) are always around, as welcoming and accommodating as ever. Ratish is a true gentlemen to the RC brand, as he always ensures that my near 90 year old grandmother is always comfortable whenever she visits. Sundar also amazes with his Indian culinary skills, and conjures something special whenever we visit. I am confidently certain that Sundar will be able to scale the kitchen to even greater heights in his finesse displayed in Indian cuisine - true to Indian culture, amazing to the tastebuds and a feast for the eyes.We love the festive atmosphere and looking forward to returning soon! With kind regards,Kelvin and Eric

Beautiful place! Food was delicious and ambience is great. Would especially like to mention Manager Wayne for arranging a table for us and Chef Kim Hui for his exceptional service. Pleasantly surprised by the special cake and birthday song planned by Chef Kim Hui and his team. Also, server Wan Ting for constantly looking out for our needs throughout the dinner. Thank you for making this celebration a memorable one. In addition, I would like mention Chef Alvin, Chef Kwee Hong, Chef Kingson and Chef Jean for their great service as well. It has been an enjoyable dining experience at the Colony
2
At first I was excited by the different food stations on offer. Once I'd had a bit of this and that my excitement turned to dissappoinment. The hot food was cold.The food lacked flavour, even the cheese section and desserts were lack lustre, it's pretty hard to get these staples wrong. If aesthetically pleasing ambience is what you desire, this place could work. If its good food I'd go elsewhere.Seafood and sushi section was good however.
5
We decided to celebrate a significant birthday in this restaurant which is know for its high end buffet. ...and were greatly impressed... the personal service we enjoyed from the assitant manager Tessa Reyes was wonderful as was the selection of foods.... and to top off the lovely meal we were presented with a birthday cake.Excellent Job all round
5
The staff services at the Colony was exellent. The staff are all very attentive to us, they make sure our cups are constantly filled up with waters. The chefs at the Colony provides a tip top service! They explained to us what are the speciality and the “must-try” food over there. Knowing that we don’t really take too spicy food, the chef specially cooked for us a not so spicy chilli crab to suit our taste bud! The seafood served at the Colony was very fresh and the varieties of food over there was madness! There are so many varieties that we couldn’t even stuff in our stomach anymore. The desserts are to-die-for! The selections of sorbet ice creams, and super delicious cakes that you can’t resist! If you have a sweet tooth then it’s a heaven for you.The bread served over there was very fresh and yummy! Overall it was really a great experience to dine at the COLONY! BIG THUMBS UP TO ALL COLONY CREWI rate a 10/10
5
This is really a good and recommended place, food is awesome..nicely plated and tasted sooo goodChefs from the noodles station, pasta station, roasted meat station & oyster station are very friendly and polite...the smile from their face make my journey memorable...A few names was noticed and i just wana say thank you for their great service.Chef Yi Jeh, Yao Kang, Dennis & Adib. Thank you guys for the great service! I will definitely come back again! Good job

The variety of food is amazing. Despite having a large selection, each dish is well executed. In addition, the service is excellent! Ms Simran who took care of us has been super attentive and made our dining experience a wonderful one.

Me and Alex had our friends birthday celebration at Colony and was very impressed by the extra efforts done by Chef Benton, Chef Nicolas, Service Manager Kelvin and Raj! 😊

My family and I are regulars at the Colony since its opening in late 2015. I am simply attracted to the great varieties and good quality of food one can find at the restaurant. It is no wonder that I "selfishly" plan all my get-togethers with families and friends at the Colony more times than I can count. In any case, I am gratified and heartened to note that I can always count on the restaurant to ensure the standards of food and service, making every visit a resounding success. The warmth, professionalism, and efficiency of the wait staff definitely enhances each visit and I would like to extend my special appreciation to Raj who is always helpful, cheerful, jovial and kind to our party. Laughter is always an added bonus with him around, and I thank him for that.I would also like to thank Mr. Phil Park for his great and helpful service when I recently celebrated my birthday at the restaurant on the 18th of November. Everything was perfection and our party, as always, had a great time.The food on the menu that night was also awfully delicious and I especially love the Colony grilled lobsters and the prawn noodles. Thank you to all the staff at the Colony and please keep up your good work. I can't wait to revisit the restaurant again

We were in Singapore for only two days so we wanted to make sure we had the best food experience possible. After a lot of research, we decided on Colony based on reviews. We booked a reservation for Sunday brunch as this option seemed to offer largest spread from their menu options. We particularly focused on the seafood selection as my husband loves seafood. While they offered a large portion of seafood (chilled lobster claws, jumbo shrimp, Alaskan king crabs, crawfish, clams, conch), I wasn't impressed with the quality. You can tell they were frozen before they served it. They also offered shucked oysters (4 different kinds) which was done right before serving. The oysters were relatively large sized and were good but again lacked the flavoring I was craving from my previous experience elsewhere. Their hot food selection were plentiful but again their flavoring was good but I was not wowed but the food quality/flavoring. They offered grilled lobster tail which felt like eating rubber band which was probably my least favorite. However their sushi selection was nice and definitely fresh, which was my favorite item from our meal. Given the price point, I was expecting much more from this dining experience (food quality wise) and it felt short of my expectations. Also, both my husband and I end up immediately going to the bathroom as the food did not sit right with us. I think we will skip quantity next time and focus on quality.

Had lunch with my staff recently at ColonyGreat service! Chef Kelly personally escorted me around to show the vegetarian choicesFood was excellent,and the bright cheery design with lots of natural lighting made for great photographsThanks also to Beng Kuan for the attentive service and photographyAlso Nazar for such patience. Definitely going back

The spread was good and of good quality. The ambience was classy and does not feel like a packed canteen.Unfortunately 5 of us (out of 16 people) had abdominal problems the same night and following morning and put a damper on this rating

Defineatly the best dinner buffet in Singapore! Everything was perfect from start to finish. Me and my fiancé went here this evening to celebrate his birthday. Excellent ambiance, food was delicious from entrees like sashimi, sushi, soups, Etc to specialties like Singaporean chilli crab with mantons, really good lamb, tandoori chicken, naans, squid ink pastas, custard egg buns, to many other delicacies from around the world to satisfy any taste palate. We really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. The surprise birthday cake at the end was so yummy and their dessert selection with a fresh waffle station, ice creams etc was to die for too. We’ll surely come back when back in Singapore. The service was excellent from start to finish, staff were really good with clearing plates and getting drinks etc. keep up the good work! And Thankyou for making our night very special

We were spoilt for choice with the spread of delicious food available! But what really struck us was the wonderful and kind service that Emily extended to us during our 2 days of stay ☺️☺️ Thank you Emily for making our breakfast time so special with your ever ready smile and remembering our orders! You are what makes The Ritz Carlton service standards a class of its own

Poor layout of the place. Weekend buffet is like a zoo, super crowded, and due to the organization/layout of the restaurant it feels like obstacles / maze-like to get access to any food. Food stations are widely spread apart. There is just too much furniture around. Very cluttered. The seafood section is the worst section of all. Located near a wall, super long queues.As a result a human wall was formed and thus you are barely able to wiggle your way through. The crab legs is obviously from frozen and not fresh. The quality of food is your standard affair like other buffet. I didnt find it really stood out or differ itself from other hotel buffets. The tables are extremely small and awkwardly located. The service was excellent and helpful. The only reason why this place gets 3 stars is because of the service.For a hotel like the ritz carlton , there are certain standards to be met. This place was disappointing as its not at the same calibre as other ritz carltons around the world. eg. Hong Kong. Would not really recommend coming here as this place is just another average hotel buffet. What a shame as I had higher expectations for a hotel brand like this. My advice is for a complete overhaul of the interior design of this place - whoever did it in the first place should be fired. Secondly add something unique to your buffet that makes it different and stands out from other hotel buffets? It is better to keep things simple than to make it so convolute

The seafood dinner on Friday offers free flow grilled lobsters that were nothing short of amazing! Fresh, juicy lobsters, worth it!
5
Awesome $300 for 2 people inc free flow drinks package. Reccomend to anyone wanting awesome dinner and ready to spend the $$
5
A most surprising experience at a hotel. Fantastic food and great service. The breakfast buffet was the most fantastic I have ever had in the world.
4
Perfect restaurant to celebrate any occasion, Classy ambience, nice soft music, friendly staff . Best part is the Food , Seafood are so fresh. A little pricey thoug, but its all worst it. Highly recommended, will come again.
4
A posh ambience with great food to boot!
Although a bit more expensive that others in the same genre, you get what you pay for, and the service matches the 5-star experience.
4
The service is first rate and the quality of the food is excellent, this is no ordinary hotel buffet. Highly recommended for lunch, dinner or weekend brunch.
4
Intimate and warmth can only be expressed during our dining here. Love th cocktail that the mixologist did for us. Truly a trip worth visiting to the British charm.
5
The food variety is excellent with lots of fresh seafood to choose from. Plenty of juices to choose from. I can't emphasize enough how good their service is.
5
We arrived late for our check-in so didnt sit down until after 8pm by which time we were very hungry. Our waiter, Daren, was friendly, attentive and even took us through the areas to explain about the different meals offered. This was seafood night: fresh oysters, gravlax, crabs and prawns which we both enjoyed twice! Then on to a small laksa: rich flavours in the soup with delicious ingredients & garnishes. Thai, indian (over 10 choices) and chinese (many dumplings etc) all fresh and despite been near the end of the night, no shortage of food. Desserts are dainty, sweet and delicate - we both tried our hardest for desserts but were defeated and couldn't finish our choices. This was the loveliest dining experience I have had for such a long time. Once again I need to mention Darren who, from Penang, was so friendly& informative about the foods and wines. Just writing about this already makes me want to go back. Definitely recommend!
5
I am a frequent traveller and I have lived abroad for years. I am very confident to say Colony and its buffet deserve a spot in my top 3 restaurants in the world list.Variety, consistency and above all quality are unmatched. Wine selection is great (even if not excellent) and service is fantastic.Colony is my staple visit every time I am in town
4
the standard of the buffet is very well. the seafood there are fresh , and like the oyster there~~~~
5
The services are excellent. The staff are friendly, helpful and polite.
The food is fresh and dessert is fantastic.
Things to improve - The lighting of the restaurant is a bit too dark.
5
Great selection with great food. Other than the sashimi which offers 4 or 5 kinds of fish, there are freshly-prepared food. Ambience is great and suggest seating by the side with the greenery view.
5
Celebrated my birthday there. Colony has a fantastic ambience and buffet spread. Kudos to darren and rethish for their excellent customer service. Highly recommended. Two thumbs up.
5
We visited the new Colony 2 years ago after the renovation and we were some what disappointed with the seafood selection and a view other things at that time.We have been back quite a view times and have to say that the improvements have been Great!The Colony's buffet is hands down the best buffet in Singapore.Great selection of a very high quality, including the seafood.keep it up!P.S. One thing that could be better is the lighting. It is very dark at certain table
5
Best buffet i've ever tried in Singapore! Second time here and it still doesn't fail to disappoint us, but instead makes me want to go back again! Service was great and personalized, with napkins folded each and everytime we left the table to get more food from the buffet spread, water refilled whenever the cup was emptied, plates cleared as soon as the servers see that you have finished with your course, and servers checking on you to make sure that everything was going well. They have a wide spread of variety, ranging for Chinese stir-fried, Indian cuisine, carvery meats, Chinese roast meats, DIY spaghetti, DIY chinese noodles, cheeses, cold cuts, sushi, seafood, dim sum, breads, desserts and even a drinks counter. It is a very rare sight for drinks to be included in buffet prices in Singapore because it is usually chargeable. There is also a wide variety of drinks ranging from pink guava juices to milo dinosaur and even strawberry iced tea! Their fruit counter were very extensive and fresh as well, having exotic fruits such as dragonfruit, jackfruit, nectars, whole pear which were a rare sight in other hotel buffets i have patronized. Each and every single thing served was so good that it can be sold or served as an individual dish outside. For other hotel buffets, there are only a few highlights out of all its spread, whereas for this every single thing they served was the highlight. Food was of good quality too! Extremely value for money. Would definitely return again.

I went to Colony in August for Sunday brunch. I've been a lot of brunches in Europe and Asia and i cant deny that Colony is the best in the world. Great quality of buffet(if you are seafood lover, you must visit and experience!) and service made us happy and touched. It's just another level with others. And we met an amazing lady, Erin from Korea. She is the one who made our brunch perfect. She's very attentive and humorous. The restaurant was quite busy but she constantly checked on our table and try to communicate.Also we met a great manager, Rejan. He also made us very comfortable and gave us unforgettable memories. Not only these two staffs, but also all the service staffs and chefs were great. Thank you so much for everything Colony team. I'll defiantly visit again. Merci.

If you are a tourist with a short span of time in Singapore and want to get a good representation of Singapore local dishes, here is the place to go to try some of the signature dishes in singapore.For locals this place is good for the family ocassion. For the buffet and as a singaporean, i believe it captures the authenticity of Singapore local food dishes
5
We had dinner this week and i can proudly say that spread of buffet was stunning though we need to find/look for the staff to accomandate and ask for our reservation table. It was remarkable service by Emily, very polite and every time we need something she’s always there to give helping hand, unlike the the other indian service staff, we request to get us fresh utensils but instead he gave us back the old sticky utensils (haiz!)Anyway, their ambiance was amazing and enjoyable dinner, peaceful and lovely place. Their kambing soup was excellent and the meat melt on your mouth, great choices of noodles section as well as all the chef were really accommodating, they even send us the eggyolk bun to our tableWill definitely be back again and look for Emily to give service to our table.Kudos to all
5
I went & had high tea with a girlfriend she had never experienced high tea before & she loved it!!We were served by Erin, she was helpful & served us well, she also introduced us to a wonderful new dessert ....which was delicious.....Very good value $54 which includes tax also included a glass of Moët.....What a great experience....I have been to a few high teas & I think this one tops them all ...
5
No doubt a 5 star hotel, great food, great ambience, very courteous staff and food was surprisingly great... There wasn't s single dish that i did not like, variety and taste were well taken cared of... kudos to the chef and team at Colony!
5
Wide variety to choose from, service was really good! Price slightly pricey but worth to go once in a while
3
Had dinner from office. There were 45 of us.
Very elaborate set up for sea food and all types of meat.
There’s an Indian section too but very few vegetarian options.
Maybe my expectations of colony is higher!
4
Been here pretty often, it has very good spread and worth every penny. One of the best buffets around. It is spacious and the staff are very attentive. Able to host big groups of 20 people. One pax is about 90+
5
I was invited to Colony, a good friend, a great business partner and a like-minded, seafood goer buy me a dinner. It was another fantastic night, flattered with the best seafood in town. If you are lover for fresh seafood, real freshness, i would recommend this place. Try the Oyster and the lobster, a luscious and natural sweetness will tinkle you for more.Chef Benton came to our table to ensure we are well served and taken care of, we are impressed by the chef dedication and commitment to his work, devoted attention in his culinary belief. We would also like to thanks Sally for serving us with a big smile.Recommend for business dinner, and family get together
5
You'd expect no less from the Ritz Carlton. Great service from the staff despite the entire restaurant buzzing with guests. Roving cocktail station - always a great idea :) opted for the lemongrass prosecco and it was delicious, light, with just the right amount of sparkle. Kind of wish it was a buffet of savories and not the other way around with desserts though! Free flow coffee/tea also refers to having to stick to the same drink throughout the afternoon.. I.e. You can't have a latte and then change it up to a peppermint tea if you decide it'll go better with your ice cream from the ice cream bar later on. I'd come back again just for the beautiful daylight that comes through the windows. Ambience is perfect
5
It was my brother and I first time to Singapore and so grateful having dinner buffet in Colony . I really like the sushi side from Chef Siang , it was so fresh and tasted good! For my brother, he ate a lots of chili crabs and I believe he will definitely come back again just for the crabs! Thank to Chef Kim Hui for the crabs and Chef Desmond for lobster dishes.Overall the service was pretty good as well! It was really worth of money spent and we highly recommend for all of you who looking for an amazing buffet dinner in Singapore
4
It was my very first time dining in Ritz Carlton and I can say it was an excellent experience ever! The service was pretty professional and friendly! I can see all the hostess and waitress keep smiling while working all the time. In an addition, I was very satisfy with all the amazing foods! Special thanks to Chef Rayson who made the pasta for me, it was so freaking delicious!!! Thanks for Chef Ken as well for preparing all the special dishes for us! Last but not least, thank for Chef Kingson for recommending this awesome restaurant in Singapore! Definitely will bring my family come back again! Thank you for all and have a good day ❤️❤
5
This is my favorite buffet ever, hands down. Everything is so delicious, quality is top-notch. There is something for everyone here! I love the Tandoor and the various kinds of pappadum. I think the Colony has one of the best biryani and butter chicken in Singapore. The ambience is wonderful - the way tables have been arranged ensures guests have their own private space for dining
5
We booked the Colony for our wedding of 200 guests and I can safely say it was one of the best choices we had ever made. From the very start, we were well taken care of by the Colony's manager, Gene Del Barrio. She was prompt and accommodating with her communications with us, and when faced with problems, gave us excellent advice and even offered some very creative solutions. The place on the night of our wedding was beautiful. Of course, it already boasted a wonderful ambience and needed very little in terms of extra decoration. Our guests were impressed from the start and over the course of the evening, their initial good impression only grew better with the attentive service and the range and quality of the food offered. Even now, when we meet up with our friends who had been there that night, we are still regaled with stories of their favourite dishes and compliments about the food. Many of our guests said it was their best experience of wedding food ever! We had a few serious hick-ups during the night because of the rain and one of the items we had planned almost got cancelled. The staff led by Gene Del Barrio were amazing and managed to find a creative solution to the problem that was even better than our original idea. None of our guests suspected a thing!My husband and I have only the best things to say about the Colony and we highly recommend it for your dining experience or event
5
This is where I always bring my family every time they visit Singapore. Fresh oysters and lots of high quality food. Thanks!
5
A very big thank you to the awesome team the seafood bar for the great service! Thank you for grilling my oysters with cheese! Loved the cold seafood and salad bar. Great range of food available as well. Extremely worth it!
5
Good buffet spread. About 92 age plus plus. Nice environment. Unlimited lobster and oyster etc. Find it expensive.
5
Ambience was wonderful. The seats were comfortable to relax and chill in...
the service was fantastic! Awesome service crew!
Thank you for the extra mile of warmth!
Food was good... freshness of seafood was worth it!
5
The setup of the place is very nice and grand. The staff allocation by area also gave undivided attention to the guests. Love the 5 tier food. The desserts is free flow. Love the peanut ice cream wrap the most.

妻の誕生日で利用しました。
料理の内容、サービスともに非常に満足できました。
Special thanks to Connie san.
We can enjoy my wife's birthday lunch because your service is the best.
Thank you for your kindness.
5
Wide selection of food, all ingredients are fresh and delicious.
The chicken rice was raved about but was a little too salty for my preference. Would prefer if kampong chicken is used instead so it will be less faty.
5
We are now at Colony having a family Lunch buffet. The food is good. Better than the food is the attention and excellent service from Hong :) she's always quick to clear the table while we went for more buffet spread and on hand to ask if we need more drinks..... Definitely will come back for more rounds of buffet with service staff like Hong around!!!! Thanks for the wonderful servie. Ritz Carlton Management team... Do help to convey my thanks to Hong for making our lunch a wonderful experience
4
The food was great but did not give 5* because i was expecting more from their seafood bar, no lobsters for a price of 97/person (i can get lobsters and more from other buffets for only 67-70++, just saying). Other than the food, the ambience was just amazing, very classy, and mood is quite. The chairs are comfortable, the staff are very attentive with your needs
5
I was there yesterday to celebrate my husband's bday. I indicated during the reservation that it's a birthday celebration for him and requested a cozy corner seat.Indeed i got a nice seat away from the most of the diners.When i asked for the bill, instead we got surprised with a cake for him! Great staff! Keep it up
4
Variety of food was good. Chili crab wasn't fresh. We love the pasta, oysters, fresh fruit juice station, chicken satay and laksa!!! Chocolate ice cream was good too.
5
The vast choices of food available make this a truly memorable dining experience that one must definitely try in Singapore
5
I had the buffet here and it was probably the best buffet I have ever had in my life. I can not wait to return!
5
Well-stocked buffet with a nice ambiance setting. Food was fresh, from seafood to local delights. The only drawback was the juices weren't really nice.
5
I have only ever had Sunday brunch at Colony, but it is the best - the choice and quality of food, the free flowing champagne, the friendly staff and the wonderful ambience of the restaurant make this the perfect venue for a special occasion
4
My family and myself enjoyed the lunch buffet on Saturday in the Colony of Ritz Carlton hotel. It was bright with the skylight and cosy environment for family dining. Although some of the quality seafood quickly ran out due to the crowd, e.g. the scallop on ice and snow crab, there were other seafood like mussels and prawns available. For desserts, our favourites were Tiramisu and, peanuts with ice cream crepes, which were feshly prepared at the desserts counter
5
Just celebrated my wife's birthday with her family over Saturday buffet lunch. The ambience of the Colony is pleasant. Bright and cosy. Acoustics is such that the place is not too noisy. The spread was extensive. Only managed to try about 70% of what they had to offer. Bread and Cheese, Cold Cuts, Salad, Seafood, Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Local, Chinese, Live Pasta and Grilled Beef stations, Fruits, Desserts, Chocolates and a wide assortment of juices. Personally felt that the food was of better quality than most hotel buffets. Premium stuff include extra virgin olive oil, premium butter, pine nuts, Himalayan rock salt, squid ink pasta, larger sized Chinese stir fried shrimps, mussels, thick slices of fish, offerings of jackfruit etc. Albeit perhaps they could consider introducing oysters and reducing the saltiness of the Indian cuisine. The service was excellent. A delicious complimentary chocolate truffle cake was provided to us for the birthday. Also special mention to service staff "Hong" who had patiently, attentively and cheerfully waited upon us. Highly recommend this place
5
The restaurant has very good reviews so I decided to test it out. Went for afternoon tea and boy was it a treat. Ambience:The restaurant was big and tables were well-positioned to give the spacious feel. The lighting is good and it makes diners feel relaxed. Service: Ritz-Carlton's service has always been known to be top-class. The waiters look genuinely eager to be of service, they were very attentive yet not overbearing.The food: The tea service starts with a glass of champagne, then followed by a fixed portion of savoury canapÃ©s served in Nonya-style "tiffin" containers, and free-flow of desserts. Taste-wise, the savouries are average at best, while the desserts are generally very good with some exceptionally delicious
5
Really wanted to visit other restaurants in Singapore, but this played a spoiler. The food was delicious and the menu extensive so out of greed came back for a couple of days to complete the menu. One of the best menus in Singapore. I guarantee that
4
If you love oysters, there are 3 variety to choose from - New Zealand, Irish and French. The King crabs, prawns and sashimi, sushi are Yumz. Make sure you try to prawn noodle and lobsters. Juices are suoer nice, especially the soursop. Do not miss the lava cake
5
I've enjoyed many lunches and brunches at the Colony. Great ambiance, buffet is well done (sometimes circulation can be tricky with so many people) but overall impression is very good. Staff is attentive and friendly. Best brunch in Singapore as far as I'm concerned.
5
Nice ambience. Sitting outdoor sea Breeze and having the cold drinks it’s a enjoyable experience. Rainy days sitting outdoor not advisable. Indoor design is beautiful and very comfortable. Nice staff and hospitality too.
4
One of the better quality buffet spreads that we've tried so I can say that this is a buffet that we will want to return to! Hopefully the dessert varieties fare better during our next visit!
5
Good quality food and service at the ritz carlton standards. Always value the money. Keep it up!
Feels like coming back again and again:)
5
Had our family breakfast buffet there several times and everything always went right. Impeccable service, wide remake of food choices and decent food quality. Beautiful decor and will definitely come back here again
4
Nice ambience. Very nice to have natural light. Good mix of food. Includes freshly squeezed fruit juice, freshly baked bread, good mix of brie cheese. It is on the pricey side but overall well worth the visit. You get what you pay for.
5
Excellent service and a good spread of food. My family and I usually go for the breakfast which is $40 something for adult and $20 something for children above 5 and below 13 throughout the week (weekend same price!) before ++ charges.Additionally, if you do not have to spend too much on dinner buffet, it is also highly recommended to buffet lunch which is cheaper at around $56++ for adult and $28++ for children.For a 5-stars hotel at those prices, you can't really complain
3
I'm not a fan of buffets but the spread set before us looked wonderful. Unfortunately as we'd just walked miles out of our way due to Grand Prix road closures we were hot and tired so opted for the a la carte. Big mistake no doubt, but I'm basing my review on our tasting experience.Service was good
5
What an amazing buffet this is, as others have mentioned the selection and presentation is out of this world. This is what I call a buffet :) You can probably see from the photos what is on display here. I will never forget the lobster bisque or the amazing port sauce that was presented with the beef, wow! I think my husband ate his own weight in oysters... It was a bit hectic but that is to be expected at this size buffet with this many people. Quite a lot of families with kids. I did find the table service to be adequate and they tidied as well as asked if we wanted new silverware all the time. One tiny suggestion for the dessert buffet, I'd love to see smaller versions of the Ritz's amazing macarons and perhaps some berries. (I may have missed potential berries, as the buffet area is vast.)
5
We celebrated our 2nd wedding anniversary there. Although it was a busy Sunday evening, Waiter Isaac was attentive and noticed that i was unwell and offered to bring me a pot of hot tea if i like. I requested for Chamomile, and he came with extra honey for me to soothe my throat! We were also really touched that the Colony surprised us with a cake for our anniversary!

Colony serves high quality food at their buffet line. Every food presentation is carefully taken care of by the assigned Chef. The waiter

Had lunch buffet at Colony today with my family & thoroughly enjoyed the food and ambience of the restaurant. It was our 2nd time there for my wife & I but it was my mum's first but we all left very happy with the lovely food we had. The buffet spread was extensive & I wish I could try everything but it was too much .Special mention also for the 2 caring staff that looked after us so well, Nazar & Hong, who went the extra mile to make our lunch even more enjoyable! With great food & superb service I will definitely be backAdrian Fletcher

Thank you very much for the colony restaurant team on September 19 to give me a beautiful and great night.Thank you Assistant manager: TESSA [--] and internship staff at Kaohsiung University in Taiwan: EMILY ï¼ŒThank you for your professional and enthusiastic hospitality and service, and I look forward to meeting you again next time and thanks agai

Third time dining here and I usually go for the cold seafood.4 types of oysters, king crab, clams and mussels were available that night along with other cold dishes, a variety of cuisines to choose from such as japanese/western/local as well as a dessert counter. They also serve fresh fruit juices unlike other buffets.What I didn't really enjoy was the foie gras pate with an overpowering smell of goats cheese as well as my undercooked noodles from the bean paste noodles. The laksa broth was however enjoyable as well as their chilli crab.Impeccable service throughout the night. Attentive, alert and thoughtful. Ended the feast with hot camomile tea and had an enjoyable night
4
The atmosphere of the buffet restaurant was good as the interior design of surrounding was classic & elegant. The service we received is the best as we also celebrated our dad's birthday over there as well. They provided us an in-house complimentary mini birthday cake which tasted really good. There were various choices of food however the quality of the food need improvement as the Chinese soup we had was kinda salty & the chili crabs didn't really WOW us - not really fresh/ the meat was just alright & the bun wasn't those crispy type but the sauce was good
4
A very pleasant dining experience especially as we happened to have a very friendly and helpful waiter on internship named Isaac. He is very cheerful and have a pleasant disposition.
5
Fresh ingredients. Appetiser section is great! Setting and ambience was lovely. Staff is very polite. Restaurant is quite packed but tables are arranged so there can be some privacy.
4
Very tasty and delicious desserts with gd tea. Amoratic coffee. Small and delicate finger food served.
5
Fully enjoyed our lunch over there.
They even prepared a mini birthday cake for my boyf. Warm and sweet.

High tea on a Saturday afternoon.
High tea offer a free glass of champagne as well. Food wise is on a good quality but the variety is rather limited. Excellent services staffs and feel very welcoming.
5
Wonderful ambiance and conducive environment to hold celebration with your love ones. The staff were excellent and ver
5
Superb service, foods and staffs . Price is reasonable and also very nice desserts! Its my monthly meetup wif my friends cafe.
3
Service was efficient. We were hoping to have some authentic Singaporean food so opted for the a la carte menu that was very limited. I chose chicken with rice which was tasty. However, my daughter and husband chose a seafood and noodle meal that they didn't enjoy at all. We initially chose this because of its rating on TripAdvisor. We would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Just remember we did not opt for the buffet
4
although it was my second visit there, it didn't disappoint me even a bit. I won't claim that all the food are up to the standard, in fact, I found some of the food is salty/over-do like the lamb satay. but in Overall, I find food quality there worth the price. and also credit to the service personnel there as well, they deserved 5-Stars. Well done
5
This is the first time we been to colony and it did not disappoint us. The overall food quality is good and balance with a good mix of local, seafood and western. The oyster selection is great with multiple variety of oyster. The beef stew was perfect along with the satay and laksa. The service personnel was attentive and Raj from Colony recommend a fantastic wine for us for the night. I look forward to our next visit soon
5
Excellent Service; all staff wrre very friendly and approachable. They make you feel very welcome & comfortable.
Great quality food & lots of selections
Cosy ambience for get together

Good service, comfortable ambience and nice food. I love the salted egg chicken wing! Will come again.
5
Nice selection for midweek lunch...was in a bit of a hurry so didn't make the most of the buffet. Will go back
5
Nice atmosphere

Fresh and good grade of seafood
Free flow of drinks
About the widest selection of food with high standard
One of the best in Singapore

A good variety of seafood, sushi, sashimi, salad, cheese, grills, pasta station, Indian cuisine, Dim Sum, juices & desserts.

Love their vast varieties of pastries. Also the wonderful spread of buffet especially the oysters.
Will definitely go back again.

I am so lucky to have experienced one of the best service that I got ever in my life so far today. I used to come from the service industry myself, I have seen many sides of it. I do understand how crazy it can get, long hours, low wages etc. The list goes on. Today I was served by an intern (Wan Ting) who only worked for less than 2 months. And oh my god, her work and attitude, was on point. Some from my place of work, after 4 months of training, cannot even provide her level of service. I asked her, if I could write a compliment letter for her to let the company know about her performance. She replied sheepishly that I could go onto "TripAdvisor" to rate the overall service and food. But why? Why is the system so flawed, must I really have to rate u on a system, that will credit the company. So that they can look good on an internet portal, so bookings and revenue will increase? I don't think "Ritz Carlton" need it. Thats why I am here writing this, hoping that the "Ritz Carlton" management sees this. Hoping that perhaps they have a system where I can just compliment her. Honestly, not everyone working there deserve this "Title of Review

Colony is located in the Ritz Carlton and matches up to the level of the hotel. A great spread of food options, all well cooked and presented (we went for buffet option, although reality is a lot is cooked to your order/liking). A bit pricey, especially the wine list where the cheapest bottle is Â£50+ (actually cheaper to get 6 cocktails than a bottle of wine) but still altogether good value.

Exemplary service by Mr. Rethish, was extremely delighted to celebrate my partner's birthday there. Surprised by Mr. Hai Rong and Rethish, along with a train of staff, with a gorgeous complimentary cake for my partner, even though it was a last-minute impromptu hint during payment time. Thank you very much for making our occasion a special one! Dated: August 5, 2017 Saturda

boyfriend brought me to Colony upstairs for high tea i remember is second floor, the set was great, sgd 50++ before gst good for two pax, after that you can even go out to stroll around the garden. =)
5
We have enjoyed our brunch very much! I would like to recommend Colony for its best quality of food, environment and certainly the service.
5
Quality and fantastic spreads. It is real wide variety of cuisines and not just that it serves real made juices. Of course if you like to indulge a bit more champagne non stop serving. It is the best place to dine on not just on special occasion on weekends but all weekends if you love to indulge your weekends all year round.
5
been to Colony numerous times and it has never failed my expectations before.the service is always been great, servers are always with a smile and prompt to your requests. the variety of food is wide that i had never ever managed to finish trying every single dishes. great job

Celebrated my birthday with a complimentary cake. The place is beautiful and arty. With a real cosy feel. Spacing in between tables are comfy. Great spread of food with wide choices of oysters. Food was fresh and fine selection. Great service from the service staff, Phil, Darren and Angie. We will be back!

Great buffet! One of the best in Singapore. Service is great, food is great, ambience is great. Only one complaint: the chilli crab is not fresh. Been here many times for the buffet and it's always the same problem: the crabs are not fresh. Chilli crab sauce was delicious but the crab meat was watery and not firm. It's only one item but it matters. I hope they'll make it right soon.

The raw oysters were not fresh even though the shells were opened on the spot. Contracted food poisoning the next day resulting in diarrhea. My friend who didnt eat the raw oysters, was ok. The food standard dropped despite it being on the eve of PH where no discounts were given, and service was not as fast compared to the previous 2 times that we ate there

I had being patronizing since is named Green House till now as COLONY. The experience has always being delightful and I should say as unforgettable. Regardless of any celebration such as anniversaries to Birthday. This restaurant will always be my very first choice. I would specially thanks as well as to show my appreciation to the fellow nice, sincere and amazing service provider from the front line Tessa. She is always with her wide smile and greets every walk in guest. She even go to the extra mile by arranging my surprise impromptu Brithday last year. Sorry Tessa, this take slightly longer to compliment you for your awesome wonderful service arrangement. Next is Mr Raj who is such a hilarious guy. I like his gags and bring me joy throughout my stay with him. Next is Mr Kathir who is always at the Indian Cuisine. He is such a sincere chef who I never has encountered. I remembered once (during is named Green House) when I brought my little nephew to the restaurant, he wanted to have chicken rice badly. At that time, there wasn't any Chicken Rice on the buffet menu. My nephew was a little disappointed and he returned to the table. But Mr Kathir surprised my nephew with a bowl of hot and fragrant chicken rice. You cannot imagine how delighted was my nephew. My nephew was already 13 yr old now and till now he still remembers uncle Kathir who made his day which was 3 years ago. Next but now least is Mr Andy who is always at Cold Sushi Area. He always ensure all the sashimi and sushi where he prepared are freshly done up. I have to admit that I always troubled him with my request of Salmon Belly. But he never once rejected my request. I have a bad experience with Todai at MBS where I was being criticized by the sushi chef by asking me "Do you know one salmon has only one belly?" I was shocked as he could just easily told me as the belly is running out......Thats why whenever I feel like having Sashimi, COLONY is my first and only choice. Today I visited Colony, no doubt the restaurant is full but the service providers are very fast and efficient. Specially thanks to Wan Ting. She is so attentive and fast and not forgetting of her beautiful smile. Finally I met Mr Kathir and Ms Tessa who are always in the earlier shift. Ms Tessa still remembers my favorite seating and straight away bring us into the nice ambient restaurant. Mr Kathir greeted us and do us a special Tissue Prata. This is the best Tisue Prata in my lifetime. Thank you Mr Kathir. I am still in the restaurant writing this great and magical moment with Colony

Fantastic services we have been receiving all these years, from "old" Green House to "new" The Colony restaurant. I was a Ritz Pleasure member and hopefully the membership scheme will return. Highly recommended staff Rethish, Tessa and Khin Phone Thant. Professional and efficient services every time we dine in. Making us feel at home and they listened to our feedbacks. Lots of Compliments from our families. Hope to be served by them on future visits. Thank you for the wonderful experiences.Warm regards Carol Si

Multiple times visit in Colony because it was not pricy but extraordinarily high standard of food and service. Mouthful taste across different varieties of Asian food. Fresh oyster and fresh seasonal fruits & juices are attractive always. Encourage to come early with pre-booking online reservations as I think limited tables for walk-in.
5
Was celebrate my birthday dinner at here last Friday. Nice environment, nice atmosphere. Food was very fresh, staff service well. Highly recommend. Will visit again.
5
Would recommend to any one. It is a great place. Dont miss it. IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST IN SINGAPORE. I have been there only once but gave me the memory of a life time
5
Brought my partner to Colony for her birthday celebration. Very impressed with the service. Our waiter, Johnny, was very attentive and cleared our plates regularly. The spread of food is good. Ranging from French oysters to local indian cuisine. Will be here again next time
4
It is great, price cheap, waiter is frendly.
There are many dishes and they are good.
Thank a lot Colony
5
After googling and reading reviews for 3 hours, I chose to dine at Colony. I made the right choice. The service is excellent. The staffs diligently cleared our plates and filled up our water. The variety of the selection is great too as you can see from the pictures or check out their menu on their website. The food is yummy too. The only thing I didn't like is that the lightning is too dark, makes me a little uncomfortable. However, I still strongly recommend this place
5
Dining at Colony restaurant with my friend, the environment is very beautiful, we took a lot of photos. Both of us satistied by the service, especialy Mr.Raj, who always come to us and talk with us. The food here is also good, my favorite is seafood, so I took a lot oysters. Salad bar got many choices, and vegetables are fresh. Desserts are also produced on site, I love small cakes here very much. The next time we will come back and try the brunch, wish it will surpried me. 在我和朋友一起在Colony餐厅用餐，环境很漂亮，我们拍了很多照片。 服务很好，特别是Raj先生，他们总是来找我们谈谈。 这里的食物也不错，我最喜欢的是海鲜，所以我吃了很多牡蛎。 沙拉酒吧有很多选择，蔬菜很新鲜。 甜品也在现场制作，我非常喜欢这里的小蛋糕。 下一次我们回来试试早午餐，希望它会让我惊喜
5
The unsung star of Colony restaurant is Rethish (Raj). Despite my last 2 visits being in Dec 2014, he remembers details of my previous visits & created a 5* dining experience befitting of the Ritz-Carlton brand name.Unsurprising that his team members praise his management abilities & kind personality, & this pulled a seamless service from a team that's proud to be under him.Obviously, the food was great as well.Truly a 5* dining experience
3
Almost full house on a weekend lunch buffet. However it was still easy to walk around the food stations. Quite a few amazing finds, eg the chicken rice & roast meat. The pasta station and the prawns from the wok section was good. The dessert section served a variety of kuehs, but I find a limited choice for cakes. The sorbet was good
5
Really one of the best places to take your family, if you wanna pamper them! This place definitely makes you feel like royalty! From the swift action of the waiter to change the plates, to constantly refilling our drinks, the staff here makes will make you feel as if you're the only customer in the entire place! Constantly attending to you! Even from the start, when I walked in, I was greeted with the sincerest smile by Elena, our hostress for the night. She showed us to our seat The food here is amazing! Especially the seafood, it's extremely fresh! The size of the seafood are huge too! Special commendation to the Chef at the seafood bar,Hong! He was extremely patient in introducing all the types of seafood to me and even shared with me which sauces will go well with the different type of seafood! That really impressed me a lot. Lastly, the Chef who really left the best impression on me was Jason. My hands were both full of food and was shaking a bit because of the weight of the plate. Jason saw me struggling and rushed over to assist me back to my table. Impeccable service!  Definitely will be back with my family and will invite my friends too

My husband is lactose intolerant, and it is always difficult to find a place that does afternoon tea willing and capable of accommodating his requirement - and make it tasty at the same time. I called at 10 am to make a same day reservation - and I was assured that his requirement will be accommodated.We arrived at 345, and were seated at the table. The decor fits well with the name of the restaurant - very colonial and grand.The food is out of this world, and my husband really enjoyed his dairy free options - all the savoury dishes came specially designed for him, and he also received a special dessert as well.Great, attentive and friendly service. Also great value as well - the afternoon tea set was 59 per person, including a tea pot, buffet of sweets (including 2 types of scones) and a glass of champagne.We will be coming back next time we are in Singapore!
5
I've been to Colony multiple times ever since its revamp and this place never disappoints! The quality and variety of the food is great for its price point and the service was impeccable. Love it.
4
Buffet had a wide variety of choices. The Indian options were especially good (go for the Butter Chicken). The seafood array was also outstanding (go for the crab legs). Located in the Ritz Carlton, a wonderful venue.
5
Perfect for our dinner recently.
The tram service was excellent.
The quality of the food was fresh.
The restaurant was very cozy and clean.
Must visit if you are in Singapore

Great food, fresh seafood. Ambience and service were pleasant. Selection of food was okay. Loved the seafood and dessert sections.

Heard so much of their lunches, brunches that somehow excites me when my Niece suggested having high tea before heading to GEM's concert @ indoor stadium.The session kick start at 3.30pm to 5.30pm. It includes a flute of MoÃ«t Chandon. All you can eat desserts including scones, Nonya kueh. It wasn't bad really but not something I would say ...WOW factor.The high lights from this high tea is a 5 layers of dim dum as shown. Out of the 5, only the tiny little abalone with yam really stand out. Others were bad yo just ok. The beef was a written off, the lobster quince was dried n tasteless n looks like it's been on the tray for weeks. Others aren't appetising to say the least.Would I go there again? Despite its beautiful set up, ambience was good. I rather go to my Favourite imperial treasure, or Crystal jade Dine In or Paradise Palace for seriously good dim sum.Ambience 8/10Service 8.5/10Food 3/1

I wanted to host a dinner for a great friend and business associate for long time. After my recent great experience with Colony, I decided to host my dinner on last Friday in Colony. As before, we were well received and served by the professionally trained teams in the restaurant. My guest was highly impressed and that made me a proud and honoured host. Can't thanks Team Colony enough.The fine quality of foods and it's splendid choice is a given, this time I wanted to reserve my comment to a few highly impressive individual that my guest mentioned during our lunch yesterday. LeeLee, she was highly attentive and polite in serving us. You are really a wonderful person. Chef Vinary who serve us with fresh Naan, and the best Cheese Naan. The Cheese Naan is unique and worth waiting. And Chef Ang who proactively bring me the steaming hot Mantou to go with my Chili crab, and the Mantou compliment the crab perfectly.This is really a great place to host a distinguish guest... i strongly recommend
5
My partner and I enjoyed ourselves during our visit to the restaurant earlier this week. A big thank you to Elena, the hostess who contacted me to offer an earlier time slot which was not available when I made the reservation online. She noticed that we were celebrating a birthday and took the initiative to arrange a small cake for us. She dropped by several times to make sure that we were well taken care of. We were also impressed by the service and attentiveness showed by Bing Kuan and Emily who attended to our table. Lastly, my partner would like to compliment Binu for his bright smile which was a pleasant touch to the end of the meal. Kudos to the team

The previous restaurant , Greenhouse, was renovated and re-named Colony with a revamp in the food. The new place is now more cozy with smaller tables in the center and partially screened off from the larger tables at the peripheral of the restaurant. Food wise, there is a cold seafood table serving oysters, king crab legs and prawns. The big salad table is my favorite and had a big selection and fresh avocados that are cut and scooped out when you request for them. The japanese table is smaller but still has a good selection of sashimi and sushi. There is also a fresh juice and fruit table at the back of the restaurant. For hot food, there is a cooked asian/seafood bar, roast chicken and noodle bar with really good laksa, an indian counter with satays and curries, a bread table and roast beef with vegetables and grilled lobster and scallop station. For dessert, there was a fresh dessert station that was making lava cake and crepe suzette on the spot. We were too full to try the cake section even though there was a pretty sizeable selection on display. The ice cream station had many choices but as usual, I asked for a double scoop of vanilla ice cream to be mixed in with my order of single shot espresso from the complimentary tea and coffee selection to make affogato

We had lunch at colony 10 days ago.The staff as usual was very attentive and professional. But the food was not fresh this time.What disappoint me a lot is that the following morning i called the restaurant to give them feedback, the lady 1st told me nobody in charge could speak to me, then someone called me back 4 hours later and told me they would investigate and call me back again...10 days later i still never heard of colony anymore!We have been coming here quite a number of time since back then when it was still the greenhouse (before they renovated the all restaurant).Unfortunately this time will be our last as this lack of customer care is unacceptable from an hotel of this standing
5
I visited on a Thursday evening, the restaurant was reasonably crowded yet the service remained impeccable. The tables are spacious and amply spaced with beautiful soft lighting, perfect for family gatherings or just a date out. The food was what impressed me the most. The standard is very high, and they use really fresh ingredients, which I could most clearly taste in their seafood dishes, especially the sashimi and oysters. Service was tip-top, the service staff were all really helpful and smiley. A special mention to Chef Chuah, Yi Jeh and Shay for their good recommendations and service that made my day.Will definitely return and maybe try the Fri-Sat buffet next time as I have heard that the variety is even bigger and that their Baked Lobster Scarmoza is really good
5
So much delicated food being served in this restaurant. The ingredients are fresh and of high quality. Thank you Chef Kim & Hui and Angela for introducing various types of food. They have been patient and passionate.
5
Lovely family lunch, excellent service and Atmosphere! The range of food was great and we liked that you couldn't see the buffet from our table. Would recommend!
5
I loved the great seafood selection, especially the oysters! Excellent cold cut, sashimi and sushi selection and the dessert selection are to die for!
5
Lots of variety & deliciously prepared. You need to have a big appetite though as there are so many varieties. Impossible to finish trying the different kind of food in one sitting.
5
Been here countless times... Spread is excellent and Great Champs too........ Great place for family and friends to get together
5
Wanna pamper your family or your love ones? This is the place for you.. No regret~~ Worth every penny~

Best buffet in Singapore hotel . Thanks Chef Lisa , Jin Xian and Chye for guiding and recommending of the popular dishes as its my first time visiting this restaurant. Best restaurant with the best staff . Best recommended for all those tourists first time visiting Singapore.

(+) Wide selection of cuisines and food options(+) Service crew generally experienced and serve with a smile(+) Details to decor create wonderful photo opportunities. Glass panel windows offer good natural lighting at chosen dining area(-) Perhaps it was a day after a public holiday, crustaceans and raw sashimi were not as fresh as the last time we had them over here.(-) We were quite particular about the taste of local food, and I was disappointed that the laksa was not flavourful enough, and that the rojak sauce was a tad too salty.Overall, still a pleasant place to visit with partner for buffet lunch once in a long while, or an intimate gathering place for small groups to chat over a meal
4
I made a mistake: I didn't realise Colony was the buffet restaurant of the Singapore Ritz-Carlton. As a buffet, it probably has few peers; there's all form of fresh seafood, various cuisines on offer, and many, many desserts to encourage the swift onset of diabetes. But it's a buffet. Staff are polite and swift to take drink orders or clear plates, which is great considering there's 400 seats in this massive space. Probably good for Sunday brunch, with a group of friends. It's a great, big, expensive buffet. Not my thing, but it might be yours
5
Booked for champagne brunch and it didn't disappoint. Vintage MoÃ«t white or rose was excellent and free-flowing. Loved the oyster selection and fresh seafood section. Roast rib of beef was perfect. Bear in mind the buffet closes from 3.15 onwards and doesn't appear to stagger the sections, so don't miss out on the wonderful cheese selection and deserts
3
its my second visit to this restaurant. the staff seems not to be as welcoming as before. food-wise is average except for some dishes.the lady doing the strawberry crepe is very pleasant. as usual my favorite oysters didnt disappoint me. its yummy!
5
Great food with great variety. Simple delicious. A bit dark atmosphere but okay for dinner. No need to go anywhere else if you want great food all you can eat.
5
Had a great birthday buffet lunch for my hubby.
Food was so fantastic & service was top notch. Attentive and prompt services from your staffs, Angel & Johnny.
We will definitely be back again😎
5
We had a lush dinner here at Ritz Carlton’s restaurant. Pleasantly cosy and tranquil. Our meals were excellent, the ambience is fantastic. An evening to remember...
5
The Colony Restaurant has a buffet that feel is one of the best in Singapore. All Staff are always on hand to assist and offer the food suggestions!Special thanks to Chef Sundaresan to prepare the best garlic Naan bread with butter chicken for us...Well Done
5
Just wanted to take a moment to compliment the service we received from Ritesh on 1st Aug for our dinner evening. You guys were super busy, the restaurant was at capacity, and he was fantastic! I appreciate a server who does a great job and great smile, and he handled our table of 10 adults with a perfect display of relaxed competence. He keep our table so calm and share great jokes with us. Very professional person and Ritesh is a asset to the management. Well done!Thank you so much Ritesh (Ritzcarlton Singapore @ Colony) From,Indran Nai

First time dining at Colony and it was an excellent experience. The staff were very friendly and provide very pleasant service. The delicious food variety from all cuisines and friendly staff made the evening really awesome. It's worth complimenting Rethish (think he's the supervisor as he's wearing a different uniform from the rest), Andy (a service staff) and Elaine (from pastry section). Thanks all for the wonderful time.
3
I have the buffet lunch, the restaurant was full. The sashimi and seafood was fresh. I love the cheese and the carne meat. As for the hot dish, it was not bad except the fried rice and noodle was very tasteless.. the most disappointing is the desert station, all the Nonya kueh was cold and hard, the fried sesame ball was so hard.. and the variety was limited.
5
We usually celebrate my son's birthday at The Line, but decided to try a different place this year. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality, tastes & variety of the food: salad (which includes fresh Roja as you wait) , antipasti, fresh seafood & sushi/sashimi to start, a comprehensive international spread of hot food from roast duck, chili crab to tandoori, and a an equally diverse dessert spread to tempt you beyond satiety. Juices & some very lovely teas are included. We were served by Angel, our very attentive server, who positively coddled our group of seven - outstanding service. We'll definitely be back.
5
I had the buffer dinner on last Friday with my family. I am a great lover for Oyster, and Colony offer multiple varieties of Oyster, I like the French Oyster most. This place offer high quality food, my youngest son keep going for more slices of beef, they are juicy and nicely baked. If you are courting for quality Seafood, Beef steak, and fine dinning, you should pay here a visit. A great surprise was that they offer Alaskan Crab legs, which is rarely offered in any other buffer dinner. The staffs here are well groom and highly professional. Chef Yao Kang take time to explain to me the different varieties of Oyster, it's flavour and texture. I would also want to mention Chef Kelvin and Chef Ang who serve my little boy with beef and bring a hot bowl of noodle to him. We had a wonderful evening, one of my best family get together ever
4
We had the Champagne Sunday Lunch. The quality of food and drinks were superb.
Recommend the cocktails
5
This is the place to visit if you are seafood lover. Especially for those who enjoy live lobster, chili crab and various flavor of oyster. I celebrated my wife’s birthday with my 3 children here last Friday. We had plenty to savour, I would rate the seafood The Best in town, from freshly opened Oyster, to the freshly baked lobster. Service staff here are great too, you will be attended to with eagerness. I like to drop a few kind words for Cory and Raj., who have relentlessly serve us. Highly recommended if you want to host a delightful dinner for important clients, families and colleague
5
Booked here for my wife's birthday and couldn't fault it, staff went above and beyond to look after us and ensure we had a memorable evening. The food choices were extraordinary and delicious will definitely be visiting here again special thanks to Kim J Soo Katy and Cor
5
Myself and family went here last night, we eat out allot and I would say this is the best buffet we have ever had. Really top quality food, Oysters and Lobster was fantastic, staff are brilliant. I can't speak highly enough about this place, you will not be disappointed
5
The food served was fresh and wonderful. There are a variety of food and deserts. The staff were very warm and friendly. Excellent staff service from both the manager and the Colony. Perfect ambience for a dinner date. I'll rate for overall a 9 out of 10Food 9/10Service 10/10Ambience 8/1
5
This is my second time to Colony and the service was really good. Smiles from all the staff and very keen & quick service. Food is TOP-notch too! Having tried buffet at many other places, I think Colony is truely one of the best. Free-flow juices & coffee and tea included too. The staff were also very nice and friendly to my very active Son.... even though he messed up the seat around him, the staff at our section was very kind and cheerful in helping to clean up after him. Thanks for the good service and food!
5
I chose this because of the many positive reviews on Trip Advisor and frequent mention of excellent gluten free options. I had conversations with 3-4 chefs about the options available and 2 cooked me individual dishes to reassure me that they were indeed gluten free. A special mention therefore to chef Desmond for a lovely fish and asparagus dish which was delicious. Plenty of options from the Indian section and 3 types of gluten free bread available though I was busy eating other food! There's a lovely juice bar as part of the buffet so I'd say there was no need to order other soft drinksService was excellent with plates being cleared quickly and the staff were super-friendl
5
One would think that the food served at a buffet in a 5-star establishment would be of good quality. At Colony, this is not the case. It was fantastic. The variety was mind boggling & those items that I had was as good as those served in restaurants famous for them. The service is excellent too with the staff even making recommendations & bringing those recommendations to your table. Will definitely dine there again
4
Two visits to Colony in total - one lunch and one dinner. Service was great from the get-go, with plates being cleared immediately once finished, and glasses refilled with water promptly. The seafood offered was very fresh, especially the prawns and oysters which I loved. There was a sizable selection of cold cuts, salads and desserts as well. Range of hot food could be larger though, especially for the Chinese food section (dim sum). The drinks could be customised, as I requested for a mix of the orange and mango juices which they gladly obliged. Ask for any available card discounts upon payment as Colony offers discounts for cards of certain banks. Great buffet overall and its worth return visits. Prices are a bit steep though
5
It's my second time here, and Colony is still under my top picks for buffet in sg so far. There's a good range of food for you to choose from (seafood, sushi, live stations for cooked food, fruit juices and more..), and I'm impressed that the quality is consistently good! Had an enjoyable time at Colony - service was attentive and atmosphere was great.
5
Food was excellent, and service was prompt and friendly. We also had complimentary flames of biscay (signature drink) served to us when we curiously enquiries about it as we observed an adjacent table with the demonstration. Overall and enjoyable experience and lovely ambience!
5
Good selection of food.wide variety offered. Pleasantly quiet and ample space for diners. Would definitely plan to come back again.
4
Great selection of dishes. Brother-in-law loves the chilly crabs. I like the curry prawns.
Deserts especially the chocolates are decadent. Can not stop going to desert station.
4
meats were amazing, very large selection of cold cuts and options for the salad bar and fruits... people usually recommend the signature colony laksa, which was good, but if you're a small eater and need to optimise the amount of carbs you're taking in, go for the squid ink spaghetti in cream sauce instead! it was heavenly! two thumbs up for the excellent service and friendly staff as wel
5
My husband brought be to Colony for my birthday celebration. Food are of great quality and the free flow of oysters from different countries are a plus. Service was top notch excellent, friendly and warm staff with great efficiency in clearing the plates. I would like to take this opportunity to commend on the service staff named Angel. She is an angel indeed. When she overheard that this was my birthday celebration she took the initiative to get us a small cake for celebration. That took me by a sweet surprise. I will definitely return again.
5
We went there spontaniously. Classy and fine atmosphere, but rather dark.The staff was very attentive. Eventhough there are a lot of tables, they never made u feel lost. Food is top, especially I liked the sashimi, butter chicken and tandori chicken. Very nice chef at the grill. He prepared a very fine lamb rack which was very tender.Good deal: we paied around 100 US$ per person with wine

I booked afternoon tea to relax and everything would have been lovely: attentive staff, good tea, food and pastries but a selfish woman brought a baby and let it yell every 3 minutes for the entire two hours. What's the point of relaxing in a lovely atmosphere then? Might as well eat dim sum in a back alley. The staff did their best: they moved me to an empty part of the restaurant, but baby was so loud you could still hear it and it was dark and very cold from the aircon in this other part of the restaurant. It was really unfortunate and the hotel should reconsider letting people bring infants to disturb others if you want to preserve a good atmosphere. Pros: food was lovely, abalone bites were delicious, two types of scones both tasty, fantastic creme brûlée and grapefruit sorbet, also a lovely selection of traditional Singaporean desserts. I would have preferred more balance between savory and sweet pieces. The staff was fantastic and brought me a little birthday cake when learning it was my birthday! Everything was lovely apart from the baby but this pretty much ruined my enjoyment. If there's a afternoon tea that doesn't allow infants I will take tea there instead next time.

To celebrate a birthday, we decided to have dinner at Colony on a fine Sunday evening. Indeed, the atmosphere and ambience was just right for a warm celebration; Packed venue but not overcrowded or noisy, the last of the sun streaming through the greenhouse-like decor, the gentle wafting of pleasantly delicious scents to waft the appetite for a wholly satisfying buffet ahead. Fresh oysters and crab at a buffet are always the highlight for any seafood lover and are arguably the main justification for a substantially-priced meal. The ones at Colony did not disappoint. The popiah and kueh pie tee were delicately put together and were bursting with local flavour. The hot meal section, strategically placed away from the ever-popular fresh seafood counter, had an abundant variety of different cuisines including Western, local and Chinese. Special mention goes to the fried rice which had tiny abalones in it as well as the fantastic chilli crab. There was also cooked soup noodles (choice of either laksa or chicken) that came with a very decently-sized portion of lobster meat. The whole affair was simply sublime. To top it all off, dessert selections were aplenty and each item was cleverly petite so as to not overwhelm and overstuff one at the end of an excellent buffet.Many thanks to Darren and Katy for their attentive, sincere and friendly service that helped to make the night even better! Tip: HSBC cardholders get a 15% off. Reserve in advance for a good seat

Went there last week to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and our daughter's 4th birthday.An extensive choice of food, most of which was of high quality. We were particularly impressed with the cold cuts and salad bar. Some of the hot dishes was less satisfactory, e.g. the fish and laksa.Service was fantastic and flawless - they even sang Happy Birthday to our daughter. We were made to feel very special. It is the best buffet we have had in a long while

I was at the restaurant on Wednesday evening. for my belated birthday celebration.First visit to Colony after they have changed from Greenhouse to Colony. It is renovated till really classy but the lights are dim till really dark. Its really hard to eat with the dim lights. If I am not wrong, they expanded the area to display their cooked food as well.Seafood spread was good. 4 different types oysters, snow crabs, 2 different clams, fresh prawns. The sashimi were well sliced and tendered freshness. snow crabs was juicy and sweet.Love their juice bar. Spoilt for choices.I had their prawn dumpling and shanghai dumpling. Skins is way too thick. Kind of disappointed with the cooked food. Maybe too high expectation for Ritz. No doubt their service staff was top notc

if you enjoy your seafood, this is perfect. so much choice you likely wont be able to make your way round everything. fixed price buffet good value if you want classy surroundings and have a hunger
5
I've been here both for dinner and for Sunday Brunch and I loved it both times. I recommend all to come here with huge appetite and empty stomachs as you will surely want to try a bit of everything once you see the buffet.
5
Definitely one of the best buffets in town in terms of selection and ambience. Amongst the seafood spread, meat galore and desserts, there is a huge table entirely dedicated to cheese. A shout out to the Colony signature cake. Simply sedap!
5
First time to this restaurant for dinner buffet.Definitely , the name live up to its reputation as one of the best buffet . Also to thanks Chef Sky , Chef Andy and also Chef Joshua . Never had been to a restaurant that have such excellent service. love this place , thanks colony
5
Came to dine with friend to celebrate a special occasion . Chef Desmond , Chef Norman and Chef Jian feng really make us feel special on our first meeting here . Also not to forget Mr.Raj for his great service.Definitely will return again to this great plac

Have been to the Colony three to four times. The most recent, to celebrate a birthday took place two days ago.The interiors are done beautifully. You feel you have a measure of privacy. It is very cosy (no harsh lighting). The waiters as with other places are quick to ask to clear your plates. They are also observant and proactive.The is Chinese (chilli crabs served), Indian, Western food and also small stalls serving roast meat/laksa.You will also find a cold cuts section, a salad, bread, cheese, sushi and seafood section. The alsakan/snow crab legs and prawns are terrific. There is a little juice room. You can pick the cups of beverage available at the counter (i saw sour sop, milo dinosaur and strawberry tea) and /or pick from available fruits and pass your plate to the staff at the counter for juicing. They will hand you a number for your plate. Return in 5 minutes or so with your number and hand it to the counter staff in return for your cup. Do that as many times as you like! I didn't check out the desserts this time but from memory, they were great.If you are wondering where to spend 3 hours with good food, good service and cosy interiors, this would be the place

We have been to the Colony twice - both occasions were for family birthdays.Well - all I can truly say, is wear expandable pants! The selection of the dinner buffet is excellent and one must come with a good appetite to do justice. Food was very fresh, appealing to the eye, and delicious! Staff service was excellent right from the service staff at the entrance to the chef who made customised noodles. There is a very wide variety of local and international fare, seafood, cheeses, fresh juices and list goes on.Will definitely return; wear expandable pants, and probably book a room upstairs since wheelbarrows are not an option! Ambience is lovely, could be a touch brighter but all good

If you fancy a good buffet then Colony is the right choice, better for adults and business just due to the ambience and lack of kids choices. The food has a great variety on different kinds of choices espec. Seafood is quite good with 4 different kind of oysters plus alaska crab legs etc. - further a rich indian corner, nice chinese dishes up to dim sum and those typical western dishes like a whole rumbsteak shank. Nice choices of cheese and breads and a good dessert buffet on top. A little bit sad that the wine choice is not with more variety but I am spoiled on this,So for the 'normal' wine drinker the choice is fully ok. Better than Edge and Line for sure
5
A friend was in town for the holiday season and I thought this is a good way for her to experience the best of Singapore food. And I was right. The buffet lunch spread was absolutely scrumptious, even for someone who lives here and eats "Singapore food" everyday.There's a appetiser section, which (strangely) serves up cold meats and sashimi, which was not very Singaporean, but I am not complaining. There is also freshly prepared "kueh pie tee". The selection for the hot food was massive! From satays, to fried kueh tiaw, to butter chicken. It does indeed present the multitude of dishes one can find in this multiracial little island. One thing to point out about the quality of the food - they are good! In fact, the shrimps were so big and fresh, I must have eaten more shrimps in that meal alone than I do for the rest of the year!We were too full for dessert but still managed to cramp in some mini tarts and ice cream. It was a very nice lunch indeed. And the setting, especially around Christmas, was classy and very festive. Definitely somewhere I look forward to return to one day

I was at Colony in celebration of a family member's birthday and also Father's day. I must say that this is probably one of the few restaurants that I would personally recommend to anyone - awesome ambiance, good food, and excellent staff. One of their staff (I've since forgotten her name) took notice that my young son was there and went the extra mile to pick out fresh salad vegetables for him and was mindful to point that she only took those that a young child would want to devour into - corn and carrot. She did this not once, but twice and was patient in helping to clear up the mess he accidentally created. A pity that I can't remember her name else I would have sent the hotel a note of commendation. The restaurant has a good selection of food - a fresh salad bar that has a good range of vegetables and cold cuts, a delectable cheese counter, sushi bar, meat grill, indian and chinese cuisine, fresh seafood cuts, and a dessert counter. There's definitely something for everyone at Colony. I personally hope to be back soon
4
The food were excellent, resturant ambience was nice and good service from the staff especially Angel who served us. 😀
4
Great selection of cold seafood - 3 types of oysters, Alaskan king crab, shrimp, clams and mussels. If you don't eat oysters or crab, the buffet will be relatively over priced. A couple of other things that set Colony apart from other hotel buffets - beautiful interior decor and impeccable service. Definitely the classiest buffet in town.
4
I have to say the foods are excellent, especially seafood is remaining its freshness till it is served to the table. However, the ambiance was not very nice as you don't actually get quiet and private ambiance as you can touch the person sitting on the next table if you want to. its just that close. Staffs are nice but not as what St. Regis hotel staffs can do. Still, i would love to come back
5
I took my family to dinner at Colony tonight. It's been a while since wehad a meal at the Ritz Carlton Singapore. The spread was good; quality of food was was excellent. The Tomahawk steak (prime rib) was tasty and cooked just right, oysters (French, Irish & New Zealand) were fresh, Alaskan crab was succulent, local laksa a must have for anyone with a craving for a good one (you won't find one with broth made from lobsters so this is a treat). I would like to commend Mr Rethish (Raj) who took care of us - thank you Mr Raj for making our family outing a memorable one. And Desmond from the carvers section who took time to explain how the Tomahawk was prepared - congratulations on your 10th anniversary at the Ritz! Lawrence Pan
5
Had the pleasure of attending with friends, at their suggestion. Exceptional selection of all types of food from seafood, indian, chinese, japanese, western. Service was first rate. Drinks package very reasonable, along with the food package. Highly recommend. Get there early to take full use of the offering as it takes a while to get through all the food options, including desserts and tea and coffee. Service starts at midday until 2.30pm.
5
The buffet was the best my family has tried thus far. I especially loved the sushi/sashimi spread because of its freshness. My only complaint is that the ambience lighting was a little dim for comfort, however the service staff more than made up for it. I would especially like to single out Martin, who helped to make the occasion more enjoyable.

Dear LewisI want to write this email to thank Retish (Raj) for serving me and my friend today at The Colony restaurant today.I wanted to give a farewell lunch for my friend, without consideration, I immediately thought of The Colony. I called Colony and was attended by Raj. He is really attentive, patience, always look out to our needs and even presented us a small cake for our farewell celebration. I want you to know that you need more people like him to be around in Ritz Carlton. Appreciate if you could let him know that we do appreciate what he does for us during our lunch.The Dining experience was impeccable as always, and I will definitely give more positive feedbacks in TripAdvisors.Thank you

Quite expensive, though they have all choices of tea and coffee but quite pricey. Service is not friendly. Youngsters nowadays does not give much thought on giving a friendly service to customers as long as they have work and finish at the end of the day.
5
We visited Colony at the Ritz Carlton Singapore on the evening of the 4th July. The food and service were both excellent. We had a range of sushi, sashimi and seafood to start then moved on to a variety of Dim Sum and other Chinese dishes, all of which were beautifully prepared and full of flavour. My wife is gluten free and the chef prepared several individual dishes especially for her all of which were excellent although there was plenty of choice for her from the various stations. Although we didn't try it the Indian station had some great dishes judging by the aromas. There were also some excellent cuts of meat including some gorgeous looking rare rib of beef. We indulged in a number of cocktails with my son trying his first Singapore Sling in Singapore, lucky lad! The ambience and mood is very relaxed and welcoming. The cost of a meal for three is fairly high coming in at $460 Singapore. Overall highly recommended if your prepared to pay the price.
5
The evening buffet in the Colony, with a lot of great seafood but also a lot of other dishes, is one of the best meals my wife and I have had in Singapore. You can add on an alcohol package for not very much, and it's a great evening out.Mr. Ritesh and his staff are really wonderful. The two waitstaff who really stood out when we were there recently were Ms. Lee Lee and Ms. Erin. All were very professional, friendly and helpful. They really made the evening
5
Been here twice within a month as not only the food is worth raving about, the service is impeccable.
We had in both occasions excellent service by Serene(if i remembered correctly) and Angel.
Service was genuine and sincere.
5
The buffet at Ritz Carlton is just simple awesome! The service is excellent and the price is even better! Make sure you come hungry and make reservations!
5
Fantastic Sunday brunch at the Colony in Singapore. We were lucky to be looked after all day by Angel. Exceptional service by Angel who ensured our glass of Moët was always topped up and that we had all we needed. Would definitely return!!!!
5
A group of us went to Colony today. The buffet has a wide variety of food and the ambience was quite good. We asked for a bottle of champagne from Ms. Angel, and she went into detail. By asking why we order the champagne, she kindly noticed that we went there for celebrating the awarding we just achieved. To our surprise, she served us a cake with the letter of "congratulations", which made us so happy. Thanks to Ms. Angel for giving us a great dining experience
5
The setting at Colony is subdued, luxurious, and a little bit eclectic with interesting art and open boxed room dividers. We were seated by windows and enjoyed the luxuriant foliage outside. The buffet is delicious and beautifully presented. Oysters from different regions in the world, a house smoked gravlax (heavenly), sashimi, lovely cheeses and Malay/Thai/Singaporean hot dishes.Elegant small sampler desserts and house tempered chocolate and truffles made on the premises also a dream. Our drinks waiter was a delight - always smiling and genuine- thank you Balan (Belan?). In fact all staff so well trained and courteous. Only downside was very expensive wine and beer ($20 - $25 a glass) but cocktails the same price so we enjoyed a couple from the extensive menu. We had a fantastic experience and would highly recommend. Our children behaved wonderfully as they were so awed by it all!
5
The variety is staggering! From the seafood, meats, local delights, foie gras, cheese and the desserts, well they deserve a whole buffet by itself. They have ice cream, macaroons, cakes, churros, crepes, chocolate fountain, chocs, cotton candy!) The cheese choices are out of this world and its really for cheese fans. If i would to go back for the 2nd time, don't go to the seafood section immediately coz that's what everyone will go for. My stomach would only contain the seafood (oysters, king crab), roast beef, foie gras, soup (chinese treasure soup all the goodies), cheese and desserts. Not sure it is good for gatherings coz the food is too good, no time for conversations
5
We went for weekday lunch buffet which was 58++ per person. Totally worth it. Almost nothing to criticise about. So, when you feel like a buffet, just go straight in to Colony. No further research needed. Great variety of food, all well cooked, delicious. Service was very up to the standard as well. If I must feedback some suggestion, I would suggest:- More choices on fruit juice. Would be great to have freshly squeezed juice- Steak was a bit thin:
5
Life could have been easier if we'd held a banquet but after years of attending banquet styled weddings, we knew it wasnt how we wouldve wanted to hold our wedding.The Colony is definitely more than just a buffet restaurant. It's exemplifies class and personality, right through its quality of food, down to its highly attentive staff.My guests loved the food, the ambience and the whole experience for the evening.We are especially thankful to the team for making at all happen. We were very well taken care of as the wedding couple. The restaurant went the extra mile to make sure we were well hydrated through the mad rounds of alcohol. Help and assistance was always had hand even before being asked.Gene was the manager who'd been with us through months of planning. Despite being out of town on the actual day, our event was well handed over to Jessica. Absolutely grateful for the wonderful experience team at The Colony delivered
5
Special commendation to your staff at Colony restaurant during our dinner with 2 families on Sat 24th Jun - Natalie was exceptional. Not only was she polite and friendly, she was especially thoughtful and thinking ahead for us, patrons just like any other. Yet, her extra efforts to go that extra mile like making a special order of spaghetti carbonara for my fussy daughter that was not on the menu, by going to the kitchen to check, then confirming again with us. That is what makes a dinner out with family that much special. Thank you Ritz Carlton. Thank you Natalie!Gregory & our party of 8 on 24th Jun 201

Good spread of various cuisines (chinese, indian, american, japanese), wide spread of breads and pastries but i wouldnt say the food there is fantastic, found myself running out of food to eat after 2nd round.. Must haves : the 36deg soft boiled egg, fruit juices, honeycomb. Friendly servic
5
Food was great there. Also plenty. Morning buffet was with huge variety of cultures and areas. You should go there very hungry, though.
5
Wide variety of food. Great service! Had an enjoyable time there. Expensive but nice and fresh selection of food.
5
A wide variety of food but unfortunately the mini steak was a little over cooked. Other than that, the food is awesome.
5
I have been entertaining myself in this restaurant many times and it never failed me.
The spread were awesome, the seafood bar was always amazing.
4
Overall everything was very good except the price was very expensive compared with others hotel buffet.Hope you can offer more discounts with cards.
4
Offers a wide variety of food and all taste nice, especially seafood!!! One big plus: great service from a lovely waitress named Angel 💖
5
Wide buffet spread and great food quality. Friendly service staffs and surprisingly station chefs are helpful and always there to recommend the dishes for you to try. Specially i would like to thank to Chef Kelly (for cooking a special dish for me that i always wanted to eat but feel embarrassed to ask for in a 5 Star hotel) and Chef On Chin for preparing a cake for my daughter when you overheard my daughter telling me tomorrow is her birthday and she wanted a cake like the next table
5
Awesome service from the staff..they really pay attention to details & anticipates your needs..eg. staff by the name Phil immediately brought a spoon for my son when he noticed my son took some dessert but w/o a spoon.Food quality was great and ambience was fantastic. For the price we pay, it's worth visiting again
5
Was there yesterday celebrating my wife's birthday. Full of praises to the place, I have been to plenty of international buffets and this was the best I have eaten in a long long time!The food was awesome, the Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Roasted Meat, everything was good. The chef was so caring and attentive! He spotted my toddler and realized that she had nothing much to eat, he then cooked a bowl of porridge for her! So nice of him!Also as someone who drinks a whole lot of water, the waitress Ms Angel was really patient and always kept a cheerful smile on her face and kept refilling my water! Haha! Every time I thank her she will always say "My Pleasure!" Not only that she was really friendly and patient towards my kids too!The caring chef and Angel were really the ones that really made the difference and made our family's night! Will be recommending to our friends and definitely be going back there again :
5
The food quality at Colony was excellent, but I could do with a little more variety. Staffs and chefs were quick to replace food portions that have been finished.Really enjoyed the evening with top-notch service from waitress, Ms. Angel, who was always ready to serve and help with any requests that my 9 other guests had. 2 thumbs up to great service
5
The atmosphere both lunch and dinner at the Colony has always been superb. The service is impeccable and appreciate the attentiveness of all staff.
5
Were celebrating my wife birthday here and we have a great time here. Good quality of food and friendly staff! Thanks to Angel who serve us tonight!
Will definitely come back again!
4
Service is excellent. Food selection was not too bad. Only downside was a lack of seafood varieties. Oysters are not served during lunch.
5
Balon & Fong Yee had a perfect arrangement for the Birthday surprise last night. They are funny yet professional!! Nice experience!!
5
One of the best buffet in Singapore.We head over Colony almost on a monthly basis.Fantastic spread Just to name a fewcold ice seafood - live oyster, crabs, prawns along with sashimi, boston cheese lobster, beef(normally tomahawk), chili crab, cooked scallops etc. etc.Live station - pasta and chinese food ( laksa, prawn and fishball noodles )Desert live station- friday serve rum baba and smore
5
The moment you step in the restaurant, you'll be ushered to your table. One of their staff went out of his way to make sure we don't miss the signature dishes! Servers were very attentive from start to finish! Buffet spread - one, if not, the best in Singapore!!! Amazing oyster selections and high quality cold cuts and appetisers. Will definitely be back!
5
one of the best buffet i have ever visited. lots of varieties. so classy. compared to other 5 star hotels? this is one of the best!! worth to pay the price. and to mention Chef Nicolas! He was great to offer us must-try local dishes. other staffs were very attentive too and cheerful at the same time.and will really make you feel that you are taken care of.I will Definitely bring my friends here next tim
5
My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner buffet experience. The seafood section was excellent with fresh prawns,oyster,mussels, crab, smoked salmon etc.We also loved the bbq section with bbq duck and pork belly on offer. The chilli crab and mornay scallops were also delicious. The selection of fresh juices on offer was also excellent. I enjoyed a crepe suzette for dessert that was finished in the pan as you watched. Altogether an excellent evening out
4
This is the first visit for my whole family to Singapore and we decided to have a good buffet dinner together. Colony was on our list and not surprise turn out to our expectation. Great selections of fine wine and Mr Balan displaced the Ritz Carlton's excellent service towards their guest by recommending pairing wine to their food. However, a bit disappointment upon the quality of food, seems happened to all hot food section in all buffet restaurant, way cooked too long. I don't expect happened in Ritz, and that's why I'm a little disappointed. Otherwise, unforgettable evening.
5
There were so many selections there with certain food items cooked on spot by the chefs there. All choices succeeded my expectations as they were so well made unlike so many other buffets. Nothing here failed to impress from the extremely fresh cold seafood to the tender steaks. Would love to visit again
5
Celebrated my wife's 50th birthday with a family dinner here. It was expensive but well worth it. Food was great. Service was discrete, friendly and efficient.
5
The usual great warm hospitality in true Ritz Carlton spirit. Fabulous food selection as always and Christmas favorites. Always a joy to be back and attentive service!
5
Good food, huge selection including fresh seafood. Great service (as expected for this kind of restaurant).
4
Love their food! Taste very yummy😋😋😋 But what a pity there were only few choices of cakes. Would be better if they serve more cakes. They have many candies & ice creams so the kids will love it.
5
Had our dinner at the colony, celebrating my girlfriends birthday. Foods very good and service was great, theres this korean staff johnny, he was very tentative, cheerful and he was able to recommend us the perfect cocktail for the night. Thank you for making the night more memorable!
5
We come back to The Colony every time we visit Singapore. The spread is outstanding and by far the best buffet in the country.Pro's - Food, the chefs come out to sing happy birthday to you with a personalised cake if you call beforehand.Con's - They need to open one in Pert
4
Quite costly at $78++ per adult! But the quality of food from all the kitchens make every cent worth. If you are seafood lover, you will be in for a even better treat to the fresh oysters, sashimi and crabs. Local delights such as the roast meat rice, laksa, zhi char and Indian delights are very good. Love the bread section and fresh fruit juice! Ambience is lovely. Dessert variety is quite limited but all are delicious! This is definitely going to be our first choice for future dinner buffet
5
My husband and i came here expecting your usual upscale buffet. we were very wrong, this place is made for royalty well the foodie kind any ways. everything is neat and clean. the service is fast and so respectable. the seafood selection is amazing. sushi, crab legs, little Thai cups that they make in front of you. then all the butcher meats, Indian, Chinese, breads, fresh juices, on and on. the desserts are another world on their own. they have mochi, sesame, vanilla, etc ice cream topped with anything and everything you can imagine, chocolate cakes, Vietnamese cakes, pudding, macaroons, fruit cups, etc. we tried so hard to taste everything we wanted...we happily failed. then to top that off the house (insert the servers' name later) gave us chocolate cake and champagne. that night we walked home and fell into a food coma. it was great. best buffet ever
5
Walking into the restaurant, we were guided to our table by Elena with her utmost hospitality. The staff quickly filled our glasses with water and patiently adjusted our seats to our liking. There was a huge diversity in cuisine, ranging from Western dishes to Asian dishes. The best Colony offered with its considerable price was the seafood. Only one funny cons: there were too many mirrors, that I almost bumped my face into thinking it was the next room
3
What's with tripadvisor here in singapore? every restaurant (except for the famous ones or owned by famous chefs) they keepon promoting or will ask you to make a review? can be a bit pushy sometimes. Going back to the food, they have a decent selection of seafood with reasonable price and serving. But nothing to go crazy about since there are a lot of seafood places here in sg. Service was just okay
5
Outstanding variety of dishes, and all of great quality. Service beyond reproach. A buffet that is without peer.
5
Have visited countless times & the service standard has been very consistent. Would love to see more varieties of dessert such as cakes for future visit
3
The website looked having a unique and good afternoon tea, however dishes and and sweets(buffet) are not more than Ritz Carlton quality as I expected. The good point is a glass of Moet Chandon Champagne is included with price of SGD49++.
5
I had a wonderful buffet dinner here last night. Lot of choices and great quality. The service was outstanding. Nathalie was so kind! Because she noticed that I was coughing, she brought me some minttea with honey and lemon.
4
The dinning atmosphere is Europe Feel, beautiful Glass-Arch, comfortable and privilege seating plan, the righ-matching art and photographies are all lining up very well. All the restaurant stuff are so warm and professional. The cold-food session is gorgeous, wonderful sushi, salad is must-try. Having said that, the hot food session could be more international, though current Indian & Chinese cuisine is really genuine. Desert varieties could be better. Net, a wonderful place! Thanks to all hotel stuffs
5
This is my fourth time dining at the restaurant, the food has been consistently good since the last three visit. Service staff was impeccable, Nazar was the name of the server this time round that made our dining experience all so wonderful. Will definitely continue to dine at the Colony
4
A very nice restaurant with cosy lighting and sofa. The items you should try, if you eat raw stuff, are their oysters and crab. When I visit it on Wednesday, they have 4 different type of oysters to choose from. Another nice place is their desert and sweets session. Overall, the food is nice and staff are very friendly and helpful
5
It's our 18th Wedding Anniversary. Without a doubt, we choose to dine at our favourite restaurant. The ambience was fantastic, especially we get to sit thru from the evening sunset to the night. The entire place is full of life and vibrant, with nice background music to pair with the nice food. The place is always full of surprises and great services. This time, we get a nice anniversary cake from the staff. Of course, special mention to Chef Jin Xian (cold seafood bar) and Chef Lincoln (grill station) for their outstanding service and attention to guests need. The service staff from the fresh juice stations are also very friendly and patiently introduce the various drinks to us. I tried almost all the nice juices.Great to be back again to spend this memorable day at The Colony.
5
Thanks Colony for the consistently delicious dinner buffet food. The options and spread are extensive, the quality top notch, presentation perfect. Special shout out to Thomas for taking care of our table yesterday, keeping a keen eye on our dishes and making sure we always had enough tea to drink. Thank you!The Chef from the Indian food station also made me some hot and fresh naan when I asked him for some plain naan as the others on display were mixed with Garlic. Thanks Chef!Cold seafood station had not just oysters but FOUR various types of oysters! Desserts were fantastic as usual, loved the salted caramel chocolate cake and the chendol ice cream. We also got a 10% discount using POSB credit card! Definitely would return again, hopefully soon :)
5
11 of us went for the buffet dinner. Service was excellent. Angel was extremely attentive to each and everyone of us and delighting us with her passion for svc. She was extremely attentive to every individual needs and anticipates what we need without the need for us to ask.Being a svc provider as well and i am extremely impressed with the level of svc that i experienced.Great job and Angel keep it up!!
4
Weekday buffet @ colony. Nice decor and environment, excellent service with helpful waiter/waitresses.
Spread of food is average and desserts are too little! Alot of candies, chocolates but cakes, I find it too limited.
4
Good quality spread. The best for me was the juice bar where they can make frozen ice smoothies with fruits chosen froma huge spread. The usual seafood, grills, etc -- all good
5
A very pleasant experience! One of the staff here called Angel is being really helpful and friendly. Definitely come again! 👍🏻
5
Service staff was excellent,friendly and efficiency.Plenty of variety in food and beverages.The icing on the cake is the ambience.
5
Superb Food. Outstanding service. Ambience cozy. Awesome place for families, couples and everyone. Great dinning experience.
5
The best dining service I've had the pleasure of experiencing. The night was perfect thanks to the amazing staff of Colony and those who served us impeccably Johnny, Sally Ho, Tessa, Darren and especially Mr Raj who went an extra mile to create an unforgettable dining experience for me. Not only was the food amazing but the overall service itself was what made the night perfect. It's these kind of service that makes you appreciate them for what they do and creates a special memory. Really, a special thank you for the staff of Colony for doing what they do best and for going an extra mile for us when they didn't even need to. It was honestly the best dining experience I've had.
5
Colony serves superb quality food!!! What makes it an heightened experience dinning is the people working there. Ritz Carlton's motto for the staffs is "Ladies & Gentlemen serving Ladies & Gentlemen". Will such a mission statement, you can just imagine the kind of attentive service from these Ladies & Gentlemen from Colony, Their lobster ball Laksa is a must try
5
Brought my in-laws here for a birthday dinner and was very impressed by the food and the service. The quality of the food served was excellent. There were 6(?) types of oyster alone, and I liked the way the food was spread out over different areas so there was a sense of discovery. An example of their excellent service: I had just brought some crab to the table and sat down, and just after I sat one of the staff was placing a bowl to wash my fingers and a crab fork down for me. Many times they anticipated what we needed, and all we needed to do was look their way and they would be coming over to help. Also enjoyed the glutinous rice, juice, a la minute crepe suzette and desserts
5
I had breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea at colony several times and the food spread never fails to please me. Breakfast and lunch buffet both have very wide spread of food. Quality of food is above expectation and is one of the reason to keep me coming back again and again. Aside from the food, the environment is one to talk about. Design of the space is beautiful and definitely liven up the whole dining sensation
4
This is by far one of the best buffet that I have had. Everything from the quality of food to service was good. However there is something that I was pretty uncomfortable about, is that the chefs at the sushi counter were actually gossiping about guests in Chinese. Other than that, i definitely did enjoy myself at Colony and would be back again.
4
Went to the dinner buffet and there was a lot of variety and the staff were very helpful. Ken Jianfeng went the extra mile for my auntie and got some plain crab without sauce, as she couldn't eat the chili crab due to dietary reasons.
5
The buffet was excellent . The service was excellent and special mention for Isabel , an intern at colony .she was attentive and initiative
5
Was greeted by one beautiful lady at the door. Good first impression.
She was attentive and polite.
Wide variety of different food to choose from, awesome.
They left feeling so stuffed and happy.
Highly recommend to everyone to try
5
One of the best buffet in Singapore, great variety and every two weeks I go there for their seafood, tries Shangri la Buffet but colony is definitely the best.
One thing, please add hummus to your menu, it's very healthy and awesome taste.
Thanks.
5
Excellent service and buffet spread, very fresh seafood (oysters and mussles). I'll definitely go back again. Thanks to my service staff, Angel ,for the exceptional sevice quality!
5
What an amazing food , service and ambience ,, everymoney was worth spending here ,, it A a must visit place

Super good service and lots of variety of dishes to choose from. Cook food and seafood are very fresh
5
Great food, Great ambience, Great Service
Always an awesome place to spend time with loved ones!
Highly recommended!!
4
The quality of food was good. However, the variety of seafood was limited given that it is a seafood buffet. Service was fantastic though!
5
We've been to many buffets. This simply tops them all. Absolute fantastic and great. As others wrote, prove is roughly 71$sgd. Worth every single cent.Service was fabulous- choices of food fantastic- they serve free juices and most important- food is fantastic!!!Surely gives several + for the Ritz!Go there and check it out yourself- we will be back
5
Was there on e 29h April to celebrate a birthday. Great ambience, good selection of quality food and excellent service rendered by the staff especially Firdausi. Will definitely visit again!
5
they have many selections of food for breakfast.
for me, their selection for fruit and yogurt made so happy.
they have chinese, japanese, and western food also.
5
Spendid experiences, the service is great, the ambience is very nice, the buffet selection is great and the quality is good!
5
There are many variety of food. And the sea food is very fresh. Excellent service. Will visit again.
5
Had breakfast with my family at the Colony and their service is simply amazing! Every staff greets us with a sincere smile, and they manage to be attentive without being annoying. There's a wide variety of different foods here with a few cooking stations and a lot of different fresh fruit juices! Special thanks to Chef Sundar for bringing a smile to my little girl and the grandparents with his personal touch, you made her day! Thank you, Colon

Located on the ground floor of the Ritz Carlton hotel, my wife and I visited on a Sunday evening. This place isn't cheap, but it's worth it. The dinner buffet is $78 pp and the drinks package $39 so when service charge and GST added the bill came to $275.40. The all you can drink drinks package - which isn't documented anywhere - was a red wine (a Chateau Lafitte Cabernet Sauvignon), white wine (a Chateau Lafitte Sauvignon Blanc), beer (Tiger) and tea and coffee. I stuck to the red wine and my wife the white. It was very drinkable. At first top ups were slow but the waiter soon got the message we wanted frequent top ups!Food was also excellent. There are numerous stations serving food from all around the world: Japan, China, India, Western etc. I had a sushi and sashimi plate for starter which was nice and then a cheese, meat and pate plate (the burrata was very good). This was followed by some lamb chops, wagu beef and Beijing crispy duck with green and white asparagus and tender stem broccoli, some flavoursome Chinese ribs and some excellent fried rice. For dessert I had a chocolate fondant with matcha ice cream and a medley of different cakes, macaroons and creamy desserts. We both left feeling stuffed and a bit drunk. Service was very good overall. I highly recommend based on the quality of the food. We would definitely return.

Colony is probably the best buffet line in Singapore now and the crowd is a sure sign that it is. The selections are extensive and the quality great. I seldom say this, but even the Laksa and Burbur Cha Cha, dishes you do not associate with buffets tastes great. The only bugbear is that it was crowded on a saturday night and people were swarming to grab the crayfish/lobster items

it was our 2nd visit (4 pax) on 5-5-2017 for colony's buffet dinner. food quality & selection still as good . very beautiful and cosy table settings, great atmosphere. staff always friendly and attentive, especially Raj, always making sure everything's well taken care of. we are very happy with his service. very professional
5
Not really a fan of buffet because of the quality of food they are serving - but Colony was an exception! They really have good quality food and a wide variety from Chinese, Western and also local cuisine! Too bad I couldn't try everything! Next time I'm in Singapore, I'll go back and try it again
5
It was our 2nd time my family dined at Colony and we are still love it. The spread is awesome, varied and of top quality, They even have a freshly pressed juice station which I relish. The food selection ranges from meats, cold cuts, fresh seafood, sashimi, dessert, local cusine...the list goes on... Service is impeccable as the staff are very polite and attentive. My husband was specially presented with a birthday cake and the waiter even sang him a birthday song. It was a delightful and enjoyable evening in the lovely resturant and we surely be back again
5
Awesome food choice and excellent service.
Especially from Kethish and Auntie Angie.
My favorite would be the raw salmon and the chili crab!
5
The variety was great! Had everything you could ask for; from meats to seafood and local cuisine. Service was top notch, friendly, attentive and intuitive. Keep it up Ritz!
5
incredible vairiety of high standard food, not a cheap deal, but with a rich selection of oysters, fois gras, sashimi in elegant atmosphere
5
You walked into a different ambience. Relax, class. The staffs are so friendly..we felt very taken care off. Nabil even made his special coffee for us.. not forgetting Michelle who sang birthday song together with Nabil for us.
5
My wife and now count Colony's seafood buffet dinner as one of our best restaurant experiences, and best nights out, in town. The food is great and there's always something new, and we can spend the whole evening there enjoying the ambiance and having a great time away from our daily routine. The wait staff are always top notch and engaging without being intrusive, and that's as important as any other part of the experience. Mr. Ritesh, the Manager, is friendly and professional and very clearly knows what he's doing. And this time we met Ms. Sophie and Ms. Jolyn, whose friendly and professional service helped make our night at Colony so enjoyable that we'll have to come back soon
5
I'm glad that I have celebrated my birthday at The Colony. The food there was of premium quality, the ambience was great and the service was excellent too. I was specially presentated with a birthday cake and the waitress even sang me a birthday song. Am really touched by her service !! I will definitely go there again !

So four months after, I was back again, this time for dinner.I prefer natural light of this restaurant so was anticipating a less lovely time in the evening. I was pleasantly surprised. With the renovation and the right music (and scent!), the place is now pretty chill at night.The cold seafood's quality was very high and came with a selection of French, Canadian & Irish oysters. Table service improved a lot from my last visit. The staff stationed at the Ice-cream section was wonderfully cheery and helpful even though there was still no labels and the ice-creams were a tad melted. The food I tried were all good except the lobster bisque which was too salty (caveat: I didn't try much of the cooked food). As usual the salad counter looked fabulously fresh and interesting. Of course not forgetting the thoughtful juice bar at the corner.With this visit Colony has rooted its place for me as the most lovely buffet restaurant in the city, 2017
5
The staffs at Colony are smiley and provide excellent service. Special mentioned to a young lady who was serving our table. Angel was very polite and attentive. She is a pleasant young lady and has a good working attitude. We had enjoyed our lunch cos of your excellent service Thank u

Before I go into the food, I'd just like to give a shout out and kudos to Dason, one of the serving staff at Colony during lunch today. There was a little boy really into the ice cream section and wanted to eat toppings straight from the bowl. I could see that Dason was worried about whether the kid was gonna stick his spoon back into the toppings bowl cos the kid was being really demanding. Thankfully he was quick and managed to prevent that. Also, he very nicely told the boy he would get a bowl of toppings specially for him and bring it to his table. I'm really impressed by his unflappable yet really considerate service towards the kid.Back to the food. Spread was a good variety. I love the drinks bar because they not only have fruit juices but also some cute concoctions on a daily basis. The last time I came it was the local fav - Milo Dinosaur. Today it was raspberry iced tea just the way I like it - more tea and less of the fruit taste.The local chicken rice section is a must try! Can rival the $30++ chicken rice at Mandarin Orchard's Chatterbox any day. Good spread of Indian cuisine too. The naan is delicious and all the different curries, dhals etc were well done. And I love the Chinese soup prepared. I had herbal chicken last time and it's so rare to get a decent herbal taste in such souls especially at buffets but they've got it down pat here! I think they've got really good chefs. One thing to note - don't save stomach space for the salted egg custard bun at the dimsum table. Siew mai was average too.Overall, service was excellent. Another shout out to Sally who was so kind to help us get another two glasses of juice from the drinks bar even though it was self service (I'm sorry we were in the midst of a discussion and lazy...). She was really responsive and efficient and v polite too. Such a joy to have her in our table area.Too busy eating, no pics! But come try it for yourself. :

I just had to write in to let you know how pleased I am with your chefs and your service staff. It was the 1st time for my elderly folks to dine in your restaurant, and they have made them feel very comfortable with a wide variety of selection, and we are all spoilt for choice. Keep up the fantastic work, and we are looking forward to returning again in the near future. Bon Appetit

Dined here for our wedding anniversary and had a great experience.
Food was good and the service was exemplary.
Special mention to the service staff: Nabil, Darren, Angie. They made our evening a memorable one. Good work guys!
4
Went here with my family for dinner. Place was quite crowded. Food varieties was great. Some of the waitress was unfriendly.
5
In my opinion, this is one of the best buffet restaurant you can find in Singapore. Love the wide variety of food, especially the oysters. Desserts are out of this world; I'm loving the chocolate truffles in particular!
5
Very good quality and fresh delicacies. We thoroughly enjoyed the oysters and sashimi. The lobsterball laksa and pasta were good too
4
had a sumptuous dinner buffet there at Colony, no complain. Excellent services, nice ambience, Great Food, wide variety ..
5
Staffs are very friendly, the extremely offer excellent service. Food looks well décor and best Singaporean taste. Atmosphere is the top class in Singapore. I definitely recommend this great restaurant.
4
Dessert counter make me disappointed;As a lady, I always have a high expectation for dessert and colony always serve Nyonya kueh for the afternoon tea and as well dinner, It make the diners feel the menu remain unchanged.Love to have juices counter and the service is great as well;Hope to see some change on menuThanks
5
It was a delightful dining experience when I had a sumptuous buffet lunch with my colleagues at Colony. The service was attentive and the buffet food quality was great. I liked the laksa because not only it had wowed me with the aromatic gravy but also the huge juicy and tender lobster balls that were not seen in all the laksa I have tried elsewhere before. The sushi was fresh, well presented and appetizing. In particular, the sushi rice was mouthwatering. The Chef at the station, Chef Siang professionally prepared and recommended some sushi for me. As it was a company lunch, so I was very surprised when the service staff served me a bowl of Chinese birthday noodle and a plate of longevity peach buns. I guessed my colleague had probably purposely or unintentionally disclosed that my birthday was just around the corner while we were at the noodle station. Thanks Chef Jian Fong and Chef Kingston for your hospitable and attentive services and for specially prepared for me the birthday noodle and the creatively decorated plate of longevity peach buns. Thank you for the surprise birthday treat and it was beyond my expectation. Truly amazing dining experience. Will surely be back again

Great weekend experience in the recently refurbed restaurant in the Ritz Carlton. The space is beautiful with high ceilings, plenty of natural light and retro-Empire ornaments and nick-nacks harking back to British rule (hence the name, right?) It was heaving on Saturday lunchtime, so the service is good if you're demanding enough - you're anonymous otherwise...The self serve buffet lets you pile up Indian, Chinese, local and various other asian cuisine while the bar serves up a pretty mean Bloody Mary (just how I like it - spicy but not too much, salt on the rim and a s%%%tload of celery: see pic!) All good, but you could have been anywhere in the world...
5
Went to Colony for the first time and was impressed with the quality of the food and the many choices of food! There were 4 types of oysters and all of them were freshly shucked. Only alightly disappointed with the fruits section as most of the fruits were a bit sour. Their desserts although not many choices but quality is tiptop! Also would like to thank restaurant staff Nabil for his amazing service. He was very observant and handed me the tools needed to cut the crab leg and dessert spoon when he realised i took desserts without taking a spoon. Thank you
4
2nd visit to the restaurant. Nice ambience and delicious food! Please give thanks to restaurant staff- Mr Nabil. Very polite and professional. Wonderful dining experience because of his excellent service...
5
After trying different hotel buffets, The Colony, is the best hotel buffet in town IMHO. Quality of food is good with great service staff. Ambience is a subtle nostalgic feel. Always a good experience. It is however one of the more pricey buffets in town.
5
We had the most amazing lunch at Colony today. The lunch buffet has a huge spread of international cuisines of high quality and each dish is well presented. We are most impressed by their service staff, Ms Angel who served us with her lovely smile and attentiveness throughout the 2-hour lunch. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we are going back again next month.
5
The sashimi station and the seafood station is my favorite. Chinese station feature Peking duck and suckling pig. Seafood feature lobsters and oysters. Curving station serves rib eye prime ribs. There are about 10 stations all in all. I love sashimi so I indulge on it more than anything. SGD $78 per person. Not bad for the quality of cuisines serve
5
I would like to recognize Jonathan, a Korean team member who is extremely hospitable and does his work with passion. Till today, my sister is still talking about the wonderful experience at Colony. On 22 February, my sister was at the restaurant celebrating her son's birthday. Jonathan took care of us from the start, personalizing his service throughout the time we were there. He was extremely attentive to our needs. In fact, when our Camomile tea was served, Jonathan made sure a bottle of honey was placed alongside the tea without us having to ask for it. We felt well looked after by Jonathan, who I see is a hardworking person and is always willing to serve. Please recognize Jonathan for his efforts, a true hospitality professional. He is the reason my sister has made a reservation at Colony again next week to celebrate her birthday
5
We stayed in Ritz Carlton and decided to go with my boyfriend for a buffet dinner. The variety of food is enormous. Everything is so tasty that we even didn't know what to try next as we were so full but the willingness to try everything was always pushing us to take more and more. I think even if u don't stay in Riz Carlton you have to go there. First of all, it is easily accessible, secondly, the price quality relationship is perfect, last but not least the food experience is unforgettable. People working there are also very friendly and help to make a choice. Go there without any doubt, you will like it for sure
5
Everytime I visited Colony, I will always take away with great food, great service and great satisfaction. Always never fail to impress me and my friend who visited for the first time. Special mention to Chef John, serving at the Cold selection counter for his superb personal service and excellent service standards. He made me amd my friend felt so welcome and certainly made our dining experience more satifying. Great job and continue to keep up the great work. Looking forward to return soon
5
The food as well as the service was about the best in singapore. The roast was excellent, the oysters from 3 or 4 countries were fresh n succulent. It's an experience one must not miss, that is if u can afford it as it's not cheap.
5
Extensive range of food. Cheese and salamis selection were great. Food were of quality and not those usual kind you'll see at buffets that were of quantity and poor quality. Dessert section was great too. Peanut wraps are a must eat. I had 4 rolls of that. :) But it does comes with a price tag, but i'm willing to pay for the quality. Must try! UOB and DBS credit card 10% off and we managed to get complementary parking too
4
Very qualitative seafood buffet, slightly more expensive than everywhere else in Singapore (90singdollars++) but you are in Ritz Carlton, right? ;) They have very good selection of fresh sea food : cold - including various sashimi, clams, oysters etc and hot - the famous chili crab, lobster, scallops etc.We went there for dinner and enjoyed everything! There is a dimsum and laksa station, curry dishes and they offer roasted duck\chicken as well. Just to mention a salad bar, sushi and a cheese table. :)One of the best buffets I've been to! The only one reason I don't give them 5 star because they didn't have raw scallops and sea urchin :) everything else was very good!As for the deserts - there is not very big selection, but being a sweet tooth I've tried almost all of them - yummy! Will come back when next time in Singapore :
5
Make a reservation at this restaurant and have the best two hours of gastronomical experience. The spread of food was extensive - with various choices of even oysters! You will not regret this - truly the best buffet in Singapore. The service was attentive!
5
Favourite staff is Nabil. Food here is nice but time limit can be longer by 15 minutes. Hope that the time limit can be extended.
5
Was there last Sunday and everything was excellent. The varieties, the ambience, and the service were so impeccable. Chef Sky and chef Alex were so attentive to our request and thumbs up for them !! Definitely will b back !!
5
I can say this is my favourite buffet in singapore. The seafood variety is amazing, the chicken rice is great! Leave space for Desserts!
4
excellent dinner buffet with a vast array of fish, meats, curries, delicacies, desserts, cheeses, everything you could want basically! Service is also very good, very attentive and the wine list is great even if you're the only one drinking.good ambience and overall a lovely place to have dinner at very reasonable price
5
It was a company trip with my two other staff in Bangkok visiting Singapore Head office. My business partner bought us to this restaurant for a receiving lunch. At first sight, we were impress by the set up and the unlimited spread of food of most popular culture and places, Japanese, Indian, Chinese to western. It is the undoubted the best Hotel Buffet lunch my Thai team and I have ever had. The food quality is flawless. When my team got in on Tuesday, I wanted to bring them for Singapore well known Chicken rice, but owing to the tight schedule, I had not done so. And at Colony, one of the buffer dish is the Famous Chicken Rice, it was marvellous. The Japanese sushi is worth mentioning too, the salmon is of top fine quality, they melt in the mouth. The only regret is neither of us have a Big Enough Stomach to taste every dishes the restaurant had to offered, the spread is far too wide, and every dishes were diligently done. The service staff is friendly and attentive. Special mention go to Chef Nicholas. He introduce me the various food counter and recommended some dishes that I should and it’s a MUST try. The Chef team is fantastic, every counter I walked to, I always have an interest to know more about the food, they delightedly prepared the food and give me a quick introduction. Never feel so pampered in my life before, being serve almost like a king in a restaurant…. hahahaha The ambience, the service team, the Chef Team, the food spread and the food quality, is absolutely a 5 stars quality. Sincerely Thank you. Hope to be back in Singapore soon, I will try the buffer dinner the next time
5
This was my second visit and the experience just gets better. The attentiveness of the staffs and the quality of the food is impeccable. The variety at the buffet line is refreshing and has a wide variety for the most picky taste buds. Upon request, Chief Ken was kind enough to help me fry some buns. Special thanks to Chef Alvin, Shay and Dennis for the recommendation at the buffet station. I will definitely visit again
5
We'd read other reviews saying that this restaurant had options for coeliacs. As two of the three of us are coeliac it seemed like a good choice for daughter's 20th birthday and we were proved right! The chef preparing the rice paper spring rolls knew to change his prep board to make us a totally gluten free spring roll with no soy sauce. Chefs Sky and Karthik went beyond the call of duty, preparing our own fried rice dish without soy sauce, and making specially for us a portion of gluten free pasta. There were so many options, from Western standards of roads and stews, right through Indian and Asian choices and even two types of gluten free bread and a sweet gluten free loaf. Then the two lovely women on the dessert buffet talked us through their options - make sure you leave a bit more room than we did if you want to sample all the toppings with the home made ice creams and sorbets that are on offer as well as patisserie! The restaurant manager for the evening was most attentive and very entertaining. To top it all, they arrived at our table at dessert with a specially made little birthday chocolate pudding and sang happy birthday to our daughter! We hadn't asked for anything, so that made her evening
4
Was there in Dec with colleagues to celebrate long service award.The food spread was really good, fresh seafood cold dish, freshly juice from selection of fresh fruits, slated egg pork rib was good and the dessert was replace by seasonal cakes like Christmas log cake, pudding and etc. Wide range of teas and coffee to end the sumptuous meal.Staff service was excellent
4
I went to The Colony for a buffet dinner and I enjoyed it. It was a bit unusual having the buffet spread out throughout the restaurant and I was maybe expecting more options in terms of desserts but everything else was top notch. Service staff was also quite attentive. I would definitely go back again
4
Impressive as always. Very high quality food for a buffet spread of this size. Despite a full restaurant, the service staff were attentive and extremely pleasant.
4
A good place to chill and catch up with friends and colleagues. Nice atmosphere. Food wise, the selection is a bit limited and quality of food is just a little above average, but they have good pastries through!
5
Food is consistently good with all the usual buffet favorites and then some. The venue itself is beautiful and service always impeccable. I find it excellent value for the price and would not hesitate to return.
4
Excellent Service and dinning atmosphere was great! In love with the variety and quality of food served.
5
First of all fantastic service from Nabil our waiter. The place was lovely and relaxed. The food was fresh and tasty - wish we could have eaten more!
Thank you again Nabil for organising a cake for us!
5
Thanks to karthik and suga for the first e Indian food you prepare and also to Beng whi is such a gentleman!!
5
Four varieties of fresh oysters and the most delectable spread of salads - this was how I started my buffet dinner at Colony. I must say that the seafood served here was quite all encompassing: baked lobster, sashimi, chili crab, crayfish, grilled fish, etc etc. you are really spoilt for choice!Desserts - all the usual could be had, but our fav was choc lava with vanilla ice cream! Despite being full house, food was aplenty, and the staff was great
4
The newly revamped Colony not only looks beautiful, but is also THE place to have a great buffet.The stations are endless, and you do need lots of stomach space to be able to try everything, which is not possible in one visit.Not only does it win on variety, but on quality as well. The Indian food corner, where the naans are always warm are a must have
5
Held a lunch meeting at ColonyYou can choose from the Ala cart or the Buffett I have to say the buffet was spectacular Sea food bar with clams muscles crab legs and scallops is just the beginning Sushi and sashimi finally prepared will have you going back f or more. Of course don't miss the hot foods. Local cuisine at its best try the laksa or the choice of meats duck and pork cooked local style And if you save some room. The desserts which there are many are out of this world Bottom line come hungry and leave satisfied
5
Went to Colony for Lunch last Saturday and was very impressive by the buffet spread. It was extensive and cater to all people with different palate. The seafood was fresh and good (pity there weren't any Oysters for lunch but it is only served for dinner). They had Japanese, Western, Indian, Chinese, etc, etc. My personal favourite was the western station as they had ala minute beef steaks made to order. It was accompanied with 3 different types of sauces, my favorite being the mushroom sauce. Another favorite of mine was the dessert station. Extensive and of good quality.I would also like to give a very big shout out to Katy and Hong for taking great care of us. They really showed the true Ritz Carlton service and ensure our meal would be a great one. Overall, I would definitely recommend people to visit Colony if they find themselves craving for a buffet
5
The ambience was nice and the spread of food was great!!! The oysters were v fresh! Will definitely be back!
4
Very sensitive to customer's needs!
My friend does not take beef but she did not mentioned to server.. server saw she did not touch the beef pastry, asked and came back with other non-beef pastry..
5
The quality of food is great. Chef also very kind to recommend the food to us. Especially thanks to Chef Kim Hui and Chef Yi Jeh. The server also attentive and polite. Overall it is good experience, highly recommended, I very enjoy it,thanks.
5
I was able to have 3 different types of meal at this restaurant during my stay at Ritz, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was very impressed with the variety, and most importantly the quality of food. Everything was freshly made, and very often right in front of you. Laksa with a lobster ball was a dish that I will always remember as the best one I've ever had, Chicken Rice impressed me with its simple presentation, and a great flavor. The service was very friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place if you want to have a memorable breakfast, lunch or dinner
4
Colony located within the Ritz Carlton is indeed a spectacular place for family for breakfast , brunch and holidays luncheons or dinners . We stayed at the hotel many times , a few occasion with a party of ten , a few kids under six .All can have a good time and fun food here .Despite a very busy place , staff very efficient and friendly Buffet style with multiple stations , and food is very good f . Holidays ( xmas / new year ) even more spectacular , oysters , foie grai prime rib station , crab legs , lobsters all in plus more . Also a mixture of eastern and western food . The only problem is you cannot eat for a few days after such a spectacular meal.
5
Colony has one of the best dining environment and their staffs are very professional. I was served by a very nice lady named Angel. She greeted us when we sat down and politely asked for our names. She then took the time to bring us around and introduced the different cuisines available. This was the first time I had experienced such a service. During the course of the meal, she regularly helped us clear our plates and gave us new cutleries. She was also very efficient in answering to our requests. All in all, i think my experience at Colony has improved a lot since the last time I was there. Thumbs up!
5
Wide food selection of Singapore local Chinese,Indian and Western cuisineHad lunch buffet on Saturday at this restaurant. It was the BEST buffet i have so far. All the seafood and sashimi are very fresh. A lot of choices of food and fruits. You can choose your own fruits and ask for fresh squeeze juice. Kudos to Ms.Nina to deliver the 5 star service and also Chef Adam and Chef Karthik introduce their station's food . Surely will be back again
5
I came at around 7pm and immediately get seated without waiting. The buffet dinner is super good with good variety of food. Also had to mention the chef that make nice food for us as I asked for some recommendation. Chef kim hui, sky, Angela, Dennis and Benton
5
The Colony dining ambient is cozy and comfortable with an A+ service although it's a buffet lunch. Kudos to Nina who served us!The Colony buffet have a wide range of delicious and quality food, taste tremendously good! Highly recommended. We were surprised with sample signature dishes by Chef Kim Hui, Alex and Dennis. We will definitely visit again, one of the best buffet experience we had so far! #DiningAtColon
5
Had lunch buffet at this restaurant with my friend. its amayzing place. wonderful and luxuly design, so many selections of food. food is fresh but not so many kinds sashimi.Especially the hot section surprised me, i think no need go the other restaurant. They has all of food tht represents SG. When I was confused in front of a lot of food, chefs very kindly explained food and they served me. I remembered your name, chef Angela n Sky.I will be back when I visit SG again
5
Service was excellent. Servers were attentive and polite. Food was a tad mediocre for this place. Selection was great though.
5
A beautiful buffet full of wonderful Asian food. It was a real treat for us to do this as a gift to my parents and well worth it. The dress code is reasonably relaxed but the service and food were excellent.
5
Have a Nice Food and Environment, we have a great days that day.
I will suggest my friends and come again. =]

Let's get something clear first - the glory days of great buffets in Singapore is long gone. Circa 8 years ago you stop by for a buffet in most 5 star hotels in Singapore and you'll be spoiled rotten by the excellent choices. It was not uncommon to see a selection of up to four kinds of oysters, besides lobster, king crabs, excellent sashimi and the likes. Then a few years later some hotels start to cut corners by offering 'special nights'. So you want to have a good range of seafood selection? Please come on Tuesday, with say, $20 more. You want to have better meat? Please come Wednesday, also $20 more. Other 'normal' nights? Same price, less items - compared to glory days. Gone were the wide selection of seafood and better meats. Time travel to today, and you're blessed to find 1 kind of oyster or a quality lobster. So, the buffet scene today is definitely not on par with those of yesteryears. So I am rating the food based on what's on offer in the buffet scene now, or this will not get a 4 star.I stopped by Colony for lunch finally after their renovation from the previous Greenhouse. Of course, it was lunch, so the items were even more limited. But fortunately the quality had not suffered. I had a pleasant time, enjoying the nice atmosphere and enjoying the quality of the food.Alas, were there things that should not have been? Yes, plenty. Firstly, it was apparent that the new renovation, though looking really good, is done to further enhance the profit of this restaurant. The stations were squeezed up, so I could imagine if it's a busy day when lines fill up. What's really unbecoming of Ritz was to design these two seaters that were close to the salad and dessert counters. They have zero privacy as people walk by and see you eat at very close range. The seats were horrendously tight, with little space at all. When I walk back to my seat after taking my food, I had to pass by these seats and believe me when I say the patrons seated there looked absolutely miserable.Then we have the food which were not labeled at all. That brought about so much problems for the staff and customers. I witnessed quite a few customers at the dessert station enquiring about the ice-cream flavours as none was labeled and saw a spectacular display of 'service' by the lady stationed there. She would first ignore the customers' presence, then ignore the first question, before showing a truly upset face to answer the questions, by rattling off the names so fast I didn't think the ones listening managed to catch much of what she said. Her horrendous attitude was totally not acceptable anywhere, let alone a 5 star hotel, and let alone Ritz.But she was not the only failure of service that day. We were seated soon after the buffet started so the restaurant was still pretty much empty at that time. However, no one bothered to come by to serve us water. We had a hard time catching any waiters' attention the whole time we were there. It was very disappointing service wise since we were really impressed by the friendly welcome of the doorman.Like I mentioned, I am rating it four stars to reflect the quality of the food, not variety. The service in the restaurant was disappointing with the lady mentioned deserving a dismissal. There was a reason why I chose to go to Ritz Carlton instead of some other hotels with similar offerings and a high degree of service was one of the reasons. However, with the lady, not an ounce of service was evident. It would have certainly, though, been easier for her if the restaurant is willing to spend a few dollars to label their food. I only managed to enjoy the day because of the maintained standard of the food and my luck in securing a good seat, ensuring that I had a relaxing atmosphere.Colony could have been way better. Some things can easily be improved, some unfortunately, not at the moment
5
We had buffet lunch at Colony buffet a few times so far. They have wide range of food, including Japanese, Chinese, Indian, and fruit jucies and pastries. The quality of food is great. The service staff is friendly and very attentive. They serve coffee and tea at the end of the meal. Ambience is good as well and the whole dining experience is superb
4
There is nothing i can complain about. perfect service, outstanding food and fantastic location. This probably the best choice of buffet restaurant I can find in Singapore. You may find more luxury restaurant in this area. nevertheless, this is still the best which i would recommend to my friends. I will bring my family to go there once again
5
While staying at the Ritz-Carlton we decided to reserve a table in their new restaurant Colony, for their legendary Sunday Champagne Brunch. We kicked off with a Bloody Mary and then flowed with the free pouring 2006 Moet. The food is visually inspiring with every imaginable delicacy available.
4
This is the sort of place that you would want to go for buffet. Because it has the ambience, fresh sashimi, extremely good and quality spread, last but not least, good service! The reason for not getting 5 stars this time round is that ritz was supporting earth day and they switch off the lights for an hour, it was too dark, almost all tables at my area were using torches fr hp to see what we were eating, and even the service staff was having problem identifying which guest were calling them and which plates were empty. I guess that is also the reason why they gave us an expired car park coupon by mistake
4
After my first visit last year, i cannot find a better one than Colony! So i came again this week.The buffet spread and quality food with attentive service still impressed me. My overseas friends like it so much with full mouth the whole night spoil with good food. Even salad spread was good! Cold dishes like hams , cheese with quality one.There was even fruit juice station! I drank kiwi juices twice! I would want to come back again!

I am always skeptical about buffet meal since the volume may be more important to guests than the quality. Not so at The Colony. It is not a buffet, but multiple buffets from different nationalities. The problem: everything is so great that having self control is absurd. One more Indian appetizer, but then a Chinese etc.etc.And then the dessert selection. This was a superb dining experience!! One of the best ever!

atmosphere was nice, food was average. live station, service was fast, clearing of plates, topping up drinks.

I had buffet lunch here and the spread is huge with many choices.
Service is ok and can be a little slow if it is very crowded.
Ambience is nice and price is reasonable.
Recommended for those who have a big appetite.

Went there for my birthday celebration. Good quality of food and service. Definitely will return again.

We like to be be "Tai-Tai" (meaning "Socialite") for the afternoon. Colony is the perfect place to be. Time: 3.30pm-5.30pm. At SGD$49 per pax, this is one of most expensive high tea in town. Food was served in a five-tier ceramic tiffin. When we sat down, Ken offered us choice of champagne OR fresh juices, anyway, he was graciously sweet and we ended up enjoying both. :) Tiffin is their house special. Takes around 15mins to prepare, so order once you are seated. You can leisurely pick your dessert later. Tiffin comes with smoked salmon with roe sandwich, yam puff with baby abalone, mini lobster quiche, pumpkin cake with chilli crab sauce etc etc ...it was simply feast for the eyes. And lastly, we ended the fabulous afternoon; English tea with choice of tea syrup added (lavender or rose

I have been to some buffets but I must say this is the best buffet I've eaten, all the meats / seafood are in tiptop quality, nice ambiance, low lighting for a smooth date and conversation what more you could ask for?Thanks Chef Adam and Chef Chan Yong for the western food and service. and Mr. Raj for his service.What i love:-Oyster was fresh-sea urchin will melt in your mouth like butter-Alaska King crab was nice and sweet.-Ice cream was awesome!-chili crab was nice to
5
Frankly speaking it was not cheap but the variety and quality of the dishes out do all other buffets I have been to. I actually felt guilty for eating way too much but I couldn't help myself! My personal favorites were the fresh oysters and king crab legs. Not to mention the roast beef was done really good, it was just so juicy and tender with the right balance of flavors. Anyone with a sweet tooth will be hard pressed to pass up on the dessert. The range was just mind blowing! Highly recommended to try this buffet at least ones in your life. After which you can go for a run to burn off the guilt and calories.

We had our family dinner on the 21st march, it was unbelievably awesome! Beautiful buffet spread accompanied by the relaxing ambience creates the best dining experience. The seafood is definitely the most outstanding for its quality. Credits to Mr. Raj for his sincere and heartwarming service. Big thanks to Chef Nicolas as he share his wonderful knowledge on local food and Chef Yi Jeh for always carrying the beautiful smile without fail as he serve us for quite a few times while we are taking the dim sum. Surely we will be back again! Thank you

reasonable price, especially lunch deal for weekdays.free parking-have to ask the waitress for coupon.Very nice food.can find all kinds of Asian, especially South-East Asian food here.Dessert is the best-even with chocolate and ice-cream with all kinds of toppings.Service is good as well.Free lunch for children under 6

This restaurant was a huge highlight during our stay in Singapore. They noted that we were celebrating a birthday and presented us with a divine cake, gift and hand written card at the end of the meal. The food was sublime. We ate ourselves into near food comas but it was worth every bite! The alcohol package was well worth purchasing also, instead of by the glass. The staff and level of service was excellent
5
Their seafood pasta in pink sauce has always been on my 'must order' list. Salad bar is decent and the ice bar offers adequate selection for seafood lovers, though not the best. Having free flow of drinks inclusive of freshly squeezed orange and grapefruit juice is a bonus. Laksa is good too and the cereal prawns are huge and yummy. The rest of the mains are standard mediocre buffet items. There's a variety of desserts but save your space for ice-cream
5
We love the seafood cold platters in Colony! Especially the oysters, prawns and alaskan king crab! Service was good as well. We love the ambience in Colony- spacious and relatively quiet.
5
Excellent buffet at the colony. Great food. Attentive and friendly service by all the staff. Special mention of Mr Lim Beng Kuan who's service was above and beyond expectations, with an excellent knowledge of wines and pairings. Highly recommended.
5
The ambience is super good and the dishes worth the value. Definitely the best buffet that I have ever tried!
5
Wide selection of Singaporean, Chinese, Indian, and Western food for any meal of the day. I particularly liked the cereal prawns and steamed fish on chili dish that is available on the lunch buffet. They also have a wide selection of salads, cheeses, sandwiches, and desserts. You have to bring a very big appetite to get the most out of your visit. They have slightly limited ala carte menu items, but this place is really built for buffets anyway.
5
Australian Mussel, Alaskan King Crab, Poached Live Prawns, Marinated Sea Squids and Fresh Sashimi (Mekajiki, Salmon, Snapper & Swordfish) are just some of the appetizers to kick-off a fantastic and absolutely great lunch with business partners over excellent venue for meetings in a posh restaurant of a luxury hotel.

Colony is a marvel; stunning restaurant delivering the grandest of buffet offerings; we are not "buffet" enjoyers routinely, however Colony is so well designed you don't feel like you are in a busy buffet restaurant due to the numerous partitions and decoration.Service is excellent and the restaurant is clearly managed exceptionally well. Shame about some of the guests who just do not know how to behave in public! Pushing, shoving, fighting over food like it's their last meal; and then consuming insane piled up plates of food, shovelling it in like there is no tomorrow (maybe to last them a week or two without having to buy another meal?), it's a real shame that the ambience is routinely destroyed by fellow diners who have no idea of how to co-exist with others.It would be all too easy to name offending nationalities, and all too easy to defend the same by excusing the perceived behaviour as being "cultural differences". Hey ho, Colony still rocks, just turn a blind eye

Had a lunch buffet on a weekday to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Food spread was good with cold seafood, cold cuts, salad and sashimi. Hot foods covered Chinese, Indian, Italian food. There's fresh fruit juices thrown in, but that's if you find them as they were tucked in a corner just opposite the fresh fruits shelf ;)Service was great. Attentive wait staff who promptly provides a small bowl to wash your fingers in and tools to help pry open the king crabs I was tucking into.Desserts were alright, but am not a fan of it to begin with. You can leave just a small space in that buffet filled tummy, just to try them out.Overall, good value to come dine in for lunch
5
We went for the MoÃ«t Champagne Sunday lunch and it was amazing. All you can drink Moet plus gin and tonics with some. Rey nice choice of Gins. The buffet had every conceivable dish you could think of. The seafood was exceptional. Big choice of oysters from France, Canada and Ireland, crab, lobster, claws, everything. Delicious. They even had a foie gras station with seared foie gras. The meat station was superb. Don't get me started on the huge selection of desserts. If you're in Singapore on a Sunday this is a must do. It's not cheap but great value for money.
5
We booked the buffet dinner at Colony for our anniversary celebration.As expected, we were greeted by a courteous staff Grace upon our arrival. But what was the exception was that instead of just showing us direct to our table, she asked whether it was our first and when we said yes, she went to show us how was the works at Colony. That is exceptional because that is what customers need to know when you go for buffet.The rest of the evening was memorable.AmbienceWonderful ambience. We were there before the sun sets so you get to see the nice high ceiling and all the decorative. But when the sun comes down and the room is lighted with the casndecent lamps, it takes into a different form and ambience altogether. One great thought that went into the set-up was unlike in most buffet restaurants, the food lines are not situated in all one area, There are islands for cold cuts, salads and sashimi. Then another cuter for all the hot food and lastly a section for all the desserts.FoodSplendid. They don't just serve oysters. They serve oysters from different region and the guy who shucks the oysters even care to explain the differences and I learn something new that night. The spread was balance between western and some locals. The dessert was sublime and they have daily specials. Ice cream is a must.PeopleThe best service ever. I truly understand why it is rated 6 star. We were served by Nabil who was just an intern but he went beyond his way. He suggested the drinks, the food and even got the chef to whipped something for my wife when she could not find garlic naan on the line. When Nabil came to know that we were celebrating our anniversary, he went to the kitchen to get us a special Vanilla cake. Never tasted any cake so so smooth. Lovely. The came Mr. Retish who is the F&B Manager. What a guy!And also thanks to Cary. Nabil topped it all with a cup of a cocoa coffee that he concocted himself. He has yet to have a name for it. Someday that is going to be in the menu.To Mr. Retish, Nabil and the entire team thanks for making the dinner a wonderful and unforgettable memory!Ray&Ju W

Some really good Asian Cusine is served here, we tried the laksa and it was delicious will repeat soo
5
Beautiful set up with attentive staff, food was very impressive and good but not over the top selection. Will come back
3
range is not very extensive, just the usual cold cuts with Sashimi, prawns etc. Have higher expectations of the taste of the food though. Feels that it is overrated.
5
We were a party of 17 celebrating our nephew and his wife's birthday at Ritz Carlton Colony Cafe on March 4th. The wide selection of fresh food was amazingly good. Western, Japanese, Chinese, Indian and local fare. All constantly replenished and all very tasty. Service was very good. In particular I would like to single out Darlene for her excellent service. Attentive without being overbearing. Darlene serves with care and with a smile. She obviously takes pride in her work.
5
Service staff really took care of us, bringing us around to introduce the wide spread as well as letting us try delicious concoction of juices.The chefs are really friendly to help as well especially when you take more than you can carry. Cold seafood is a must especially oysters
5
It was definitely an experience dining @ Colony.! Awesome spreads and excellent service.Kudos to Ms Sally Ho for her professionalism when her colleague made an error for the types of liquor provided in the beverage package. She still honor us with the type that we had requested .Even,it is just for one glass that is good enough! Thanks Ms Sally

I will not eat anymore buffets, I will not eat anymore buffets, I will not eat anymore buffets,I will not eat anymore buffets! OK, I have finally learnt my lesson and conceded that help yourself / free for all dining is always a disappointment. Its not that Colony is really doing anything wrong. It wouldn't be so highly rated on TripAdvisor if diners weren't impressed.So, why the average review? Lets start with the positives. The sushi and sashimi were excellent as were the shucked to order oysters. The low was the crab. This was the main attraction for my wife and I. It was watery and quite tasteless. The same can be said for the prawns. Both were probably frozen. For the rest? Just average. The local cuisine was catering for western palettes. Curries were quite bland. We aren't big dessert eaters and only picked at a couple of samples. In our opinion, they tasted quite generic and processed.My wife and I dined mid week. The meal wasn't cheap (I know, food and drink in Singapore is). With a cheap (sic) bottle of wine, water and service charge the bill was £200. For those that prefer quantity over quality, its probably relatively good value. However, our meal the previous night was at Artemis. This is a fine dining restaurant. The cost was considerably less for a superior experience.One final criticism. The service at Colony was average at best

We went on the 19th Feb'17 to Colony to celeberate our daughters birthday. From the beginning everything was done very professionaly . Our booking, seating arrangement everything was perfect. Ambience of the dinning area is cosy. I have to mention few names that made this night very very special and evening to remember. First was the service manager/leader Raj. A consumate professional at service. Right from the start till the end of our dinner. Took care of our choices in food and arranged cake for our daughter. Atttention we got made us feel like royalties.The other fantastic person who truly looked after us was Chef Benton. This is the first time i have seen a Chef on the floor attending guests. He was attending many guests but still managed to give us personal attention. From the moment we told him it was our daughters birthday he went out of his way to ensure we had one of the best dinning experience so far. There were some very spectacular dishes we received for the birthday girl. Dishes that were delicious in taste, color, texture and platting. Hats off to the kitchen team for these fabulous dishes. Then there was Chef Sunder and Chef Suga who absolutely spoiled us with yummy tissue paratha for dessert and special macroons. In this stone age to get service and attention like this is phenomenal.Special mention of Angie who was efficient in clearing our table of dishes and making us look civilized.Last but not the least Peter Mainguy the GM. He was passing by but took some time out and spend few minutes with us. All in all a night to remember. APPLAUSE!!! for everyone at Colony.No hesitation in recomending this wonderful food joint to anyone who just doesnt want food but also service of highest quality.THANK YOU...

This is my 8th time heading back to the Colony, and while the staff are different, service and quality remain unparalleled. You're greeted by the maitre d who asks if it's your first time, presumably to check if you need to be introduced to the gastronomical spread of different food stations. Your waiter for your dining area comes to you, asking most politely if you'd like to start with still water, or perhaps wine. Then you had to the cold seafood section and you're meet with oysters freshly shucked from France, Canada and Ireland and New Zealand. Compliment them with cold crab and giant scallops, clams and mussels, and you're off to a smashing start to your dinner. I couldn't resist the Parma ham and other more exotic cured beef slices. They go so well with the more than 7 selections of cheeses. Of course, you wouldn't want to miss the lamb rack grilled upon order...so tender and juicy. You'll get to enjoy the famed chilli crab, sze chuan prawns, lobster laksaand many other local dishes. In the end, enjoy the array of quality local and international desserts: kuehs, crepe suzette, chocolate soufflé and more, with your choice of gourmet coffee or tea. But the evening is made exceptionally special when you get royal treatment from staff like Nabil from Sri Lanka. He pays attention to you even though there is a crowd of diners. Without my asking, he comes offering me another glass of apple juice, noting that I headed to the juice bar. When he saw that my table had cold crab pieces, he quickly offered the crab pincers and meat scissors so that I could eat the crab with dignity. He offered to recommend his personal concoction of coffee, and was prepared to make it decaffeinated so that I could still enjoy a good night's sleep. All this with a smile, and with the experience and skill that befits this classy restaurant. Truly, Nabil helped make a typical buffet experience a gastronomical journey as if we were travelling first class

This is my third time came this buffet, the first and second visited was wonderful, everything was so great and the seafood very flesh too, this time all the ice bar area seafood not flesh, even the oyster, prawn, and the king crab...! I strongly recommended my 2 friends to join us to dinner but after our visited I feel sorry to my friend... :
5
We attended the Colony Restaurant on Valentines night and what a great night it was. We were greeted with a glass of Champagne and a Red Rose for my wife.The choice of food at the Colony is impressive and what ever part of the world you are from you will be catered for. Remember that wine generally in Singapore is always expensive in restaurants, usually starting from £60-80 a bottle.I would say do not have lunch on the day you visit here for dinner, we started with shell fish going on to meats and fish dishes from around the world and finished with hand made pastries, desserts and chocolates.You must visit when inSingapor
5
Good food. Especially the chilli crab which my wife loved. Kudos to Chef Benton and Chef Siong who recommended some of the dishes. Also to the excellent service from Phil who served our table
1
We arrive at 13:25 on a Saturday and the staff made no mention of the fact that they stop serving at 14:30. The lunch bill was very expensive but we didn't manage to get past our starters from the buffet (although they were happy to spend time advising on their wine list
5
This is a true once in a lifetime experience and hopefully more than once! This was just great. Big variety of great food. Fresh seafood, oyster bar, dim sums, big variety of warm dished and great desserts. Of course free flow of proper champagne is a big plus, Moet Vintage 2006. Anyone spending a Sunday in Singapore should experience this. It's pricey but worth every dollar
5
Had dinner buffet on Friday night at this restaurant. I was the BEST buffet i have so far in my life. All the seafood (yes REAL seafood, big lobster, crab, oyster and shrimp) are very fresh. There are lots of food to choose. The pasta is also very good. Everything is at the top quality. The service is also fantastic. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore
5
I came here to celebrate my gf's birthday, the buffet was amazing, quality of the food was the best I ever had for a buffet. Especially the seafood was amazing, great quality sashimi, crab, oysters. We enjoyed the seafood so much we almost failed ro try the other dishes. The indian food, chinese, and especially the deserts were perfect as well.I was surprised about the dress code though, we were clearly overdressed, I saw many people in tshirts, and semi shorts. The staff surprised my gf with a birthday cake and a song, very sweet
5
First advice is to make a reservation, we did it and needed it. You will find several stations with different types of dishes, Chinese as well as Indian, Sushi as well as Italian, and also cold seafood, cheese, sweet deserts and much more. Zhe food is very good! The service is good, sometimes they are not able to refill the stations and clean them up. So I would make a second advice: try to avoid the "rush hour" between 6:30 and 7:30 p
5
The settings of Colony is spacious clean and there are just soooo many selections of food. Especially love the fact that all kiosk are live station and great service. Food are fresh and tasty. Love the dessert sections the most, well worth the money spent. Lunch buffet !!
5
There are rows of fresh seafood such as king crab legs, half scallops, black mussels, poached ‘live’ prawns, oysters...even don't remember everything. Western grills such as Beef Wellington, Beef and Stout Stew are absolutely incredible. There are the other Asian dishes such as Iberico Suckling Pig with Balinese Spices, Grilled Satay and Cantonese-style Roast and so on. Sweet temptations are hard to resist. Thank you for cuisine, the high level of service and special atmosphere

I loved Ritz-Carlton. It stood for top-notch customer service, luxury, and class - in good taste. Having frequented numerous hotel champagne brunches, buffets, I always felt that Ritz-Carlton's Greenhouse remained unparalleled.Which is why yesterday's Valentine's Day high tea experience at Colony - the restaurant that replaced Greenhouse - left me somewhat ambivalent. Don't get me wrong - Colony is lovely. Lovely ambience, delightful spread of food. The high tea menu offered a five-tier tiffin of delectable savouries for two, as well as unlimited servings of delicious desserts which was heaven for the Mister. Service however, while respectable, fell short of Ritz-Carlton's usual standards.I mean, I know I am holding Ritz-Carlton to high standards. But this is the hospitality industry and don't we know that Ritz kinda is a standard-setter?So what happened? Nothing serious, but the small touches that's gone wrong just doesn't make it feel like we were at Ritz. For example, we ordered Colony's custom tea blend that supposed to come with a choice of tea syrup enhancement such as French Rose, Pandan, or Lavender. We were informed that the syrup has not arrived, and thus "could we offer you honey instead"? Also, it took really long for the wait staff to clear out the stacked up used tiers of the five-tier tiffin sitting on the table. (The restaurant is really not that packed.) And bringing the bill to the lady during Valentine's Day just seems a tad wrong. Yes I know we talk about gender equality... I'm not going down that direction. It just feel a bit strange and not what a top-class establishment would do. Will I go back to Ritz? Yes.I think I would want to give them a chance. Maybe it's just some procurement hiccups. And maybe the staff is new. Next time better hopefully
5
Long time since we had an Asian buffet but this one is truly superb. They have several stations serving out a wide variety of dishes to suit all tastes This is a lovely situated restaurant in a great hotel. However the secret of this place is the wonderful staff. Amongst many others we were attended to by Ramon and later on Katy. Ramon took a genuine interest in us and you could see he is a class act and made the evening truly memorable. Likewise Katy was keen to please and also ensured we felt special and well looked after. We travel a lot all over the world having retired several years ago and we appreciate top class service. Ramon and Katy and the many other staff in this place are first class ambassadors for the Ritz CarltonThank you all for a terrific evening.
4
A wide variety of food and a few live stations. Fruit juice was also free flow. Will definitely return again.
5
Colony is definitely one of the most impressive buffet I have come along.From the cold cut, to local delights, the freshly squeezed juice & the dessert spread.. 3 W'... Wow Wow Wow.. :)
4
The service staff there was also prompt and attentive to our requests and clear the table promptly. Will be back again
5
Came here for Vday dinner with my gf, ultra pleased with the excellent and efficient service. Food was amazing especially the ice bar and dessert station. I will recommend Colony to anyone.
4
Memorable Christmas Day brunch with friends. It was a bit crowded but the staff were up for the challenge and all had a great time.
4
Nipped along to the Ritz Carlton for the buffet one evening hearing good things, the price is high but given the service and the sheer quality and quantity of food on offer I would easily say it was worth it. The food selection including Sushi and Curry amongst other offerings was very good and the selection vast, almost a little difficult to commit to one style of dish before getting full. There is the facility to make smoothies whilst there and the wine and cocktail list is impressive, water is topped up all the time and staff on hand always with a smile. Worth a visi
5
Definitely one of the best buffet in SG. Although pricey but the quality of the food is the best. Make sure to book during lobster night! It's more worth it! And the Alaskan crab is so yummy without the hassle if getting dirty with your hands! Will definitely go back for special occasions
5
I am impressed with the food spread and the freshness of it. There's too much variety of food that most of us not able to get to try all of them. The dessert station serves a special ice cream wrap was quite nice other than the popiah skin was quite thick. Overall from every station chef to the service staff the service was excellent
5
The spread was excellent and very good value for money, especially for reunion dinner. The more senior staff truly exhibited the Gold Standards of the Ritz Carlton service. One of them presented my daughter with a goodie bag of stuff toy and colouring book and pencils, just to keep her occupied. Another was fast to provide a large salad bowl to keep the milk bottle warm. They were quick to assist when my infant son vomited his milk. Kudos to the Ritz team
4
Great dining concept!The restaurant is designed to highlight the various foods that form part of Singapore's eclectic history and culture - ranging from traditional English roasts, through Indian, Chinese, Malay and even Japanese influences.It's a fabulous idea that enables them to offer the best of the best from all over the world, threaded together with a theme.The Chilli crab and cold seafood stands were an absolute highlight, with the dessert array almost too beautiful to actually eat.Pricing, which excludes wine - is extremely reasonable for what's on offer
5
Excellent value for money; service was great; The quality of the good was unbelievable good. Will definitely come again.
4
if you are looking for a good Sunday brunch venue look no further. Some great food with free flow Champagne and its the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon. enjoy
4
We really enjoy the food and the service. The food are well display and delicious and service staffs - shuen poh, Johnny and Raj was very attentive and helpful. Is a good dinner place that we will go again. Cheers!
5
I had a valentine dinner date with my Girlfriend, really impress with the service provided from the waiters to the chef. Big shout out to this people Chef Desmon, Chef Ivan, Chef Sundar, Chef Chuah, Chef Karthik & Chef sky. From the service staff, Kevin Seah & Rethish!
5
We were in SIngapore for my Mother's 80th birthday, I made the reservation on line prior to travelling, based on trip advisors reviews and we were not disappointed.A lovely welcome and explanation of how the buffet works - then we spent time wandering and choosing dishes, no time constraints. We thoroughly enjoyed a wide selection of foods all beautifully displayed or cooked to order.When we were eating dessert my Mother was presented with a birthday cake and the staff sang Happy Birthday which was really lovely.Colony is a large venue but designed to feel intimate and arranged very cleverly to ensure diners have their own space. A lovely evening, thank yo
5
It was day we were about to depart from Singapore and we have reserved a dinner table in Colony Restaurant...The food especially the sushi buffet was rich delicious every thing was in good order and there were a lot of choices for the many tastes. ( Japanese, Indian ,Chinese, Italian etc)The tables were clean and the service was very good.
5
I had a dinner with my friends at Colony on my business trip. With the best food qulaity and the most rememberance memory during meal was two things ; Phil tons of thank you for your best hospitality from begining to end i was truly appreciate for your caring and warm service with your warm smile. We had a very enjoyed the time because of you.Chef Adam thank you so much for serving the best food and sharing your philosophy on cuisine it was very impressive to listen your passion toward food :) Thank you Colony! I will come back to you for my next business trip
1
Food was not bad, but was really bad value for money.I felt that choice was not great and if you don't like seafood you won't get valued for the 100 dollars a head.Not great service or choice so go else where if you don't want ripped off.Worked out at about Â£1 a minute you spend in there and that's stretching it
5
We've been here a few times and they've never disappointed us. Food is always good and service is always excellent! And for this CNY, they've gone the extra mile by having Lo Hei as part of their buffet. Service staff will gladly bring any number of Lo Hei sets to your table and chant the auspicious words that go along with this dish. A special mention to Adilla (service staff ic of our 3 tables) and Chloe (cheese section) for going the extra mile. Keep with the great work!
5
Family were at this restaurant on New Year's Eve dinner on December 30.It was an absolutely wonderful dinner!Despite the fact that we are not very fond of the concept of "buffet" for the gala dinner, everything was very appropriate. An incredible variety of food - sea food, European, national -. Chinese, Indian, etc., salads, desserts, all fresh and very tasty. Do not try and one-third of food, so much choice.Beautiful Christmas decorations, Christmas music - all created a festive mood.Very friendly, attentive service.For us this was the best dinner on our trip to Singapore
5
I was very pleased with the wide spread of the buffet. I specially commend Ellie who was very attentive and polite and helpful!! Would definitely return again. Also, the supervisor Raj was very warm and welcoming. I am well pleased.
4
went there on a saturday noon for tea. this is suitable for a 2 pax dining or group setting. ambience was good. a pity the Colony's signature was out of stock.
4
The oysters and seafood were fresh and succulent. There was a relatively good spread of the dishes and fresh juices and some local beverages were also available.
5
Our server is Shuen Poh from Colony. His service is excellent. He is attentive n cheerful. Keep up the good work
5
The service for excellent.. it was my second time there n still the service was there.. service staff introduce to my staff who was 1st time there where the food was everything.
5
We enjoyed a great Sunday brunch at Colony. Like so many other great places for brunch in Singapore, the food selection and quality cannot be faulted.We paid the extra and got the free flow champagne - well worth it.The staff were excellent and attentive. Thanks to Sage, Alvin and Joyce for their smiles and service

The newly revamped Colony at Ritz Carlton is transformed into an elegant yet cosy restaurant where diners seated on comfortable couches within their individual booths during afternoon tea. "The Journey" is Colony's themed afternoon tea, infusing Asian and Western delights. As with afternoon tea at Chihuly Lounge, another restaurant at Ritz Carlton, food selection is relatively limited compared to other afternoon tea options in Singapore. However, what Ritz Carlton promises is quality over quantity.The service team is attentive without being imposing. Truly living up to the name of Ritz Carlton. I enjoyed my experience and would recommend it to others.
5
Please convey my thanks and compliments to the young chap who served me and my wife on 21 Jan. 630pm. He was extremely meticulous and responsive to our needs. And also special thanks to Colony; you surprised us with a wedding anniversary cake. I experienced such lovely first class service and will surely be back again

For the most important meal of our 6-night stay in Singapore, after much deliberation, my husband and I chose the Colony Restaurant for our evening Christmas dinner. We had a choice between the buffets at Colony, the Bar & Billiards Room at Raffles Singapore, and the Golden Peony or Oscars, both at the Conrad Continental. We both felt that Colony offered a level of dining above the other offerings in Singapore.Located just off the hotel lobby were Dale Chihuly’s stunning Anemone Walls - Sunrise and Sunset - which caught our eye and are spectacular.After a warm welcome in the Colony Restaurant, what followed was the ultimate buffet spread. The surroundings in each section are intimate, stylish and sumptuous, exuding warmth and cosiness with a nice Christmas ambience, and we settled in quickly to enjoy this fabulous occasion. There is very good muted lighting - perfect for an evening meal. Even though the rooms were full of diners and very busy, the noise remained at a comfortable level and we could converse as usual. The staff were extremely sincere, attentive, friendly, helpful and seamlessly professional. They cleared our table and replaced cutlery unobtrusively whenever required.The restaurant has a well-designed floor-plan which allows for easy accessibility to the different food areas. The excellent, delicious and amazing buffet sections were spread throughout four different areas. The choice, variety and selections of different cuisines were huge, fabulous and presented perfectly. The numerous food options made it difficult to choose what to eat.The drinks package was amazing value, with unlimited Chandon sparkling wine to start and then followed by a very, very nice French Burgundy during the rest of the meal.We had a delightful and totally enjoyable Christmas experience at Colony - and we would love to return next Christmas, and the next, and the next ……

We enjoyed our family New Year's Celebration at The RC and what a night it was. The ambiance & decor are exceptional with food stations widely spread through out the entire restaurant, so you don't feel like you are one of many, often there were only a few other diners at the same station, so it doesn't have that feel of a frantic buffet... also the tables are all in little alcoves, with many dividers throughout, beautifully decorated with period photos, so once again, it is a more private dining environment. The food was exceptional from the variety, choice, quality & replenishment. Everything was delicious and we all tried something from each station- (be careful to save room for dessert) My Husband & I enjoyed the beverage package, which was also exceptional value, including G & T's & free flow sparkling. We loved Colony & had a fabulous family evening & will return when next in Singapore
5
The food there, from salads to desserts, are simply fabulous! Though it's pricy, the wide choice of food and great service from the staff there, make it worthy!
5
Wide variety of food from Japanese to Indian to Chinese to Western. Servers were extremely friendly always with a smile on their faces.
5
Loved the choices, freshness and creativity.
Do not miss the Sunday brunch! Dinner seafood buffet offered so many amazing choices.

Some friends treated me to the buffet and it is my 2nd visit this year.
Even though there was a hitch with the booking - the service and food was really good. Thank you to Calvin Seah who came and addressed the issues.

I would like to compliment chefs Chan Yong & Adam for their wonderful excellent service during my dinner with family. Was queuing for the grilled lobster... when it was my turn; there was none left. So I asked Chef Adam how long I would have to wait for the next batch. Was told about 4mins more. So I was unde isive whether to wait or not. Just then, both chefs has a short conversation & suddenly... one of them came over to me with a plate of the grilled lobster fresh from the oven. Such little heartwarming gestures & attentivenesz from the chefs really makes my day. Making our diners feel so special.Most certainly was not expect such 'going the extra mile' service at all.Another service staff I would like to compliment is Service Staff Alex. He is also very attentive & hospitable. Very cheerful disposition too. Our family truly enjoyed ourselves at The Colony. Hed

Attention all oyster and crab lovers - if you have yet to try this buffet, then you really should really make a table reservation immediately. I was there over the Christmas period last year, and there were no fewer than 6 types of oysters for you to savour from the seafood section. Pair that with the Alaskan king crab, I was in heaven.Apart from that, the spread is immensely comprehensive. Personally, I really enjoyed the entire experience. Usually for such international buffets, I would tell myself that I won't want to come back anytime soon. I was sitting at the table after the meal at Colony, although feeling very full, and finding myself asking when I should be back again!The ambience is lovely, and the service crew were very friendly and accommodating. I really had a pleasant time

went there for a birthday celebration. party of 8. enjoyed the buffet spread and excellent service. place is nicely decorated and each section has its own cosy space. didn't feel like it was too crowded although there were lots of people.liked the food display and the selection of food were good. yummy food and drinks except for the chilli crab.blessed to have the opportunity to dine at Colony
2
Ambience was great! Food wise was okay. One of the oyster wasn't fresh. It had a awful stench. We felt that the culinary team were either too task oriented or busy talking among themselves, unaware that guests were waiting for them to order. I would like to however, compliment Jian Feng (noodle station) and Genevieve (pastry) for their pleasant service

I didn't think it was possible to get impossibly lost in a restaurant, but here it is. Once seated I was expecting our waiter to tell us where everything was but on arrival we waited a while for anyone to acknowledge us and then they only explained where to go when prompted. Once you eventually find the area you're after you then have to work your way back to your seat, which is a trial in itself! The food itself more than made up for it, we found this was a great way to sample many of the local dishes on offer and some of the desserts were well worth a second helping
5
Had a nice dinner at Colony with a very wide spread of food selection from cold cuts to desserts - totally spoilt for choice. With great service too from Ken (Supervisor) who treats you like an old friend with his warm smile and impecable service. Also Alvin and Angie for their attentive and friendly service too.Highly recomend that you do not miss - i will be back for sure
5
Unbelievable variety of food and of high quality for breakfast style presentation which is hard to do for a high volume of guests. They did it very well and the staff and surrounding were wonderful
5
Excellent quality food buffet with extensive choice & selection. Warm and comfortable ambiance. All in all a very positive and enjoyable dining experience
2
Towards the last half an hour of the dining hours many food was not refilled. Staff services was great and responsive.

I bring my family to colony, celebrate our Christmas.
It was fantastic, we will come back again for every special event. Thanks, we have very enjoy for our Christmas day.
Food fresh and friendly staff.
Keep it up, 5start.
5
I have to say I wasn't disappointed. My server was sweet, kind and helpful making me feel comfortable to seat alone. The ambiance is nice, along with excellent food. It's the best meal I've ate in a long time. Highly recommend
5
Ambience is comfort and peaceful.
Staff are professional and helpful.
Food slightly saltish and desserts too sweet but a great variety
5
This is my 3rd time here and every time there is a pleasant surprise. :)Very warm and cosy ambience. The food variety for the dinner menu is good and tasty for those who like to try many things, from fresh oysters (from different parts of the world), prawns, sashimi, sushi, starters, salads, local delicacies, lobsters, chilli crab, pastas, dim sum, desserts, cakes, ice-cream, fruits... and many more.The staff is very attentive and friendly, e.g. when they saw us taking selfies, they offered without our asking, to help us take photos. They also made sure the table was cleared at all times (when we went off to get more food haha) and replaced our cutleries.They also prepared a nice little Anniversary cake for us which was a very nice little touch. We love it
5
This is my first time to dine in this restaurant. On Nov 24 is thanks giving day and I am longing for the big turkey.I enjoyed my food very much. The salad with lots of variety, very fresh, and ham have a large of selection and tasty as well. The big turkey is very popular so have to wait for the chef to arrange, it is very juicy and I love it.There are many food sections and I can't try all of them. Pricewise, is worth for it, with good environment and best service. Special thanks for Korean staff Phil, who is very attentive and polite.Bakery shop offers hugh discount from 7:30pm and I also bought some bread and jam, taste is excellent as well.If I visit Singapore again, I hope to return to this restaurant
5
The Christmas brunch they serve is so good that I am sorry I even ate yesterday. Everything is delicious and well prepared, especially the Indian food section, where the chef explained everything on my dish. This place is a must visit if you spend your Christmas in Singapore
5
My first visit to Colony was in Nov 2016, when I was hosting a friend visiting Singapore. It was a comfortable and intimate experience. The staff at Colony are extremely attentive and sincere with their services! We enjoyed our time so much that I brought my family there in Dec too. There was a wide variety of food and they taste good! Loved their wanton noodles in particular. Atmosphere is chill with mood lightings. Thank you for the awesome buffet experience, Colony
4
Colony is the only buffet I've been in Singapore that serves FRESH fruit juice at NO ADDITIONAL charges !!
Besides that, the food on a whole, is above average.
Thus, worth going for it !!
5
The usual great warm hospitality in true Ritz Carlton spirit. Fabulous food selection as always and Christmas favorites. Always a joy to be back and attentive service!
5
In my opinion the best brunch buffet in Singapore.
exceptional seafood station and love the charcuterie and cheese boards.
The vintage Verve Cliquot rose is to die for and they are generous with it.
Expensive but great for a special treat

与朋友相约一起吃晚餐相聚。很舒适的地方！还有很贴心的服务人员-Monika。 看到我咳到很凄凉，自动送来honeylemon，说是让我润喉,要我喝多点保护好我的嗓子！😍 thank you Monika!
5
Best spread in Singapore so far and it is not to be missed! Sumptuous spread of oysters from various regions, lobster, sashimi and lots more quality gourmet creations. Worth every penny! Reservations recommended.
5
I was recommended to try Colony by a friend who lives in Singapore, and had dinner there earlier this month. Must say, it was truly a great experience!! The food was excellent with a large selection of seafood and international spread. What made the experience so memorable was the warm and engaging service at every moment by a young lady Sage who took care of our table, she even noticed my tourist map and helped to recommend tourist sites to see, I will be be back on my next visit to Singapore

Visited this place for dinner. Had the Laksa as a main course.I am a fan for Asian food and I understand that Asian food in Asia is sometimes different than what I am used to.With that said, this dish fell far below expectations even after adjusting for Asian touches.The broth was super bland, the prawn rubbery, the noodles over cooked/soft, and the cake thing cold and soggy. Sorry I couldn't review the other items since that one bite ruined my appetite for the rest of the night.The water was good and helped wash away the after taste though.Service was warm and friendly
5
It is not completely local food, but if you only have a day and are looking for a mix between good sashimi, cold cuts, and local dishes, then this is the only place you should go.The ambience is good for both friend gatherings or business meeting. I was pleased with the wine by the glass selection as well (good list with relatively inexpensive)
4
we went in expectation it's 6* service and food since it's Ritz. sometimes our expectations raises the bar of reality and I find it's easier to notice the flaws more easily. The staff at the restaurant were friendly, smiley and super efficient in clearing cutlery! We were made to feel noticed and welcomed. The food quality is good but the crab legs were too frozen.It is a nice ambience to bring your elderly family members because they will enjoy the care and attention given. For "critic" like me, Colony still have quite a no.of improvements to be made. Overall, they are considered "well trained" for service. I do feel their sincerity. My small grouse was with reservation and making small requests. (although later on they met it and it is a pleasant ending). would be good if they have complimentary parking automatically given (it's a first come first served basis
4
The buffet food spread from seafood to cooked was expectedly fresh and sumptuous. The high ceiling in the dining area provides a feel of spaciousness.Service level was excellent. In particular, its manager, Sherwin , served my wife with honey lemon water when he saw her coughed persistently. We did not request it, but he took the initiative without being asked. We left Colony feeling satisfied and happy
5
It was for a family birthday celebration. The food selection was great, there is something for everyone. Most of all, the service is excellent. I must say we enjoyed the dessert the most!
5
One of the absolute best buffet and prepared meal restaurants in Singapore. You MUST try this place!
5
This is my favourite Sunday brunch in Singapore. Anyone visiting is spoilt for choice with the immense variety of excellent food. The champagne is excellent too. A must-try for anyone looking to go all-out in terms of food in Singapore
5
Nice ambience and high quality of food! Service needless say! Lives up to its name and worth 5 star rating certainly! Thumbs up!!!!
5
Rated one of the best buffet in town, whole range of international and asian dishes from oysters to sushi, from indian naan to chilli crab, from traditional roast meats to honey baked ham. The laksa is simply to die for......word of advice....skip breakfast and lunch when u visit during dinner !!
5
We arranged to have a Christmas gathering with a group friends in Colony as we felt that it was a good way to let our hair down and pamper ourselves to a good spread of food to end the year.When we reached the Colony, it was out of the world. We felt like we have just been teleported into the British colonial days. Not many hotel restaurants take note of such intricate details for a proper dining experience.The spread of food was amazing. From the lobsters, scallops, crabs, to the sashimi and Japanese spread, to the roast and turkey, fresh fruit juice, selection of coffee and tea.I must commend the excellent service provided by Raj and the service team. They are prompt and while they were busy, it never felt rushed and that they were just attentive to everyone!The chefs Jin Xian, Lisa and Joshua at the cold dishes and salad bar area ensured that the dishes were always topped up and were all smiles. I was also recommended by one of the chefs on types of dressing. Thank you and keep it up
5
Recently I brought a group of my friends to Colony for Xmas gathering. It was my first visit. I have been to other hotels for buffet but nothing beats this. The service was excellent. Remon and one more Chinese guy were very prompt and attentive. I was impressed!Colony has a huge variety of food. I went to the meat counter and was contemplating if should I try the beef. Chef John was very friendly and took the initiative to recommend turkey and beef to me.I will highly recommend Colony to anyone who is considering a nice place for a buffet dinner!
5
We booked out a private corner for 24 of us. The food experience was fantastic, but what delighted me was the attention of the staff assigned to us. Shuen Poh was all smiles and accommodated our requests for drinks and food recommendations. His promptness and initiative is the reason this review is bumped up from 4 to 5 stars. Thanks Shuen Poh
5
This place may come off as pricey, but the service is efficient and smooth. With its well-designed layout, Colony enables customers to feel comfortable (since it was not cramped and the lighting was just right). The spread of the meal is wide and the food is cooked with precision. I greatly enjoyed my meal there.
5
We had dinner at Colony and were throughly impressed by both the food and service. The team were very attentive all the way through the dinner with smiles and jokes. Our special compliment to Alvin and Raj for making our dining experience at Colony so relaxed and unforgettable. Highly recommend in every aspect
5
Was back at Colony to celebrate the brother's birthday. Family's very impressed with Ken's service in particular. Thanks Ken!
5
Had a family X'mas celebration at Colony.
Loved the laksa and thank you Chef Justin for giving me extra serving!
Thumbs up!
5
Great spread, impeccable service. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Colony. Fabulous Christmas ambience too.
5
My trip to the Colony was indeed nothing short of excellent. From the service to the ambience and food quality, it was probably the best of those I frequent regularly. The variety of ham choices we had for lunch buffet was remarkable as well, though the roasts at "The Walk" could be better. Kudos to Shuen Poh and Phil for going to the extra mile of taking care of our needs and requests, giving us a personal touch many are lacking in this hospitality industry. Great place overall, highly recommended. Keep up the good work
5
We visited colony last year during Christmas. That was our very first time visiting colony and the food selection was amazing. We came to colony again last night with friends and once again we were impressed with the service and range of food we saw. I had personally requested from chef Vivian who prepared a lava cake and a dash of vanilla ice cream which complemented the cake dessert. It was amazing thou I was stuffed from dinner. She also recommends the sweets around the counters and it was delectable. I would not hesitate bringing my family and friends to colony for each occasion, it's value for money and delicious.
5
A wonderful restaurant with fantastic food.From all buffet restaurants I have visited, I must say they are willing to go the extra mile. As the menu is usually fixed, at the pasta station I was not satisfied with the two choices they had to offer. The cook, John, saw my perplexed face and asked if he could help me. I did not hesitate and asked for a plate of aglio olio. I am surprised as it wasn't on the menu and John didn't hesitate to offer my preferred choice. John must be applauded to fulfill my personal request while it wasn't part of the menu that night. An extra effort that went an extra mile and made me a happy customer
5
Our family had wonderful dinning experience on 17/12/2016. I had a one of the most amazing laksa prepared by Chef Justin. His art of presentation and the amazing taste has created a huge smile on everyone face. We wish to come here more often and to have more dishes prepared by all the amazing chef in Colony. Our special compliments and appreciation to Chef Justin.
5
A service experience like this cannot be found anywhere else. At times of questionable singapore customer service quality, Angie, defied all odds. As i need to take medication on a regular basis, Angie came and offered fresh water upon seeing my medication box. Usually i have to look for a waiter for assistance. But she offered it every time when i opened my medication box. Her initiative was appreciated as it made my dining experience so much comfortable.Angie showed concern and care. Something rarely evident in our Singapore customer service quality.Thumbs up!
5
This is the second time that I have attended a festive dinner at the Colony. It is a perfect place for friends and loved ones to gather especially during Christmas. The food and company was fantastic. In my humble opinion, the best dish was the squid ink pasta prepared by Chef John. He was polite and was always putting up a friendly and welcoming smile
5
I am writing this letter to compliment one of your staff by name of Nazar and commend his excellent service. Our dining experience at Colony was extremely an enjoyable one.Nazar courteousness as well as qualify of service and constant concern for our comfort is awesome.The excellent food that your chefs prepared for the occasion has also been a great both because of its comfortable and appropriate facilities.Thank you especially for being aware of our requirements
5
My partner and I dined here during my birthday and this buffet is a notch above many other 5-star counterparts.
5
Service, food and ambience is superb. We enjoyed the high tea session and will wish to be back soon.
5
This setting is always busy with people who enjoy food. The variety and quality are excellent, never enough room to fit in all that one sees laid out in a nice setting under art by Chihuly glass blower.
5
It was an absolute pleasure to visit Colony and it is the best buffet experience I have found to date in Singapore.The location is excellent and the decor and environment within is second to none. The choice on offer is unbelievable and has the quality to back it up. The Colony concept is a unique one which we really enjoyed. I was also happy to see an excellent wine list which is one area I feel other buffets could improve on. I would not hesitate to visit again and the choice and quality on offer represents unparalleled value for money.
4
The food was as usually excellent. But I was disappointed that my reservation was not updated despite the restaurant confirmed that they have amended the number of pax from 6 to 10 the day before. Although last minute arrangement was made to ensure that all of us could sit together, it was a pretty disappointing start to the family dinner
5
We flew into Singapore and took a taxi to the Colony arriving at 0730.We were greeted by very friendly staff for whom nothing was too much trouble. The range of dishes at the buffet was enormous and the food, without exception, was totally delicious. I have never eaten at a buffet of such high standard nor be welcomed by such a warm and helpful team of waiters - perfect
5
On a recommendation of family who live in Singapore we had a celebratory birthday brunch. We have been to other brunch locations in Singapore and this has now gone to the top of our list. Very attentive service, continual champagne top ups of both brut and rose. An amazing array of food, lovely fresh seafood, sushi etc, roasts, foie gras and gin bar, absolutely amazing choice of cheeses, many from France, curries, Chinese and of course desserts. The restaurant is big and a little echoey but lovely chihuly glass features on the wall and lots of pictures. It was a lovely experience
5
Had breakfast at the Colony. The place has changed a lot since I went there, when it was called Greenhouse. The decor and ambience is wonderful. The breakfast was excellent with lots of variety. The food quality was great. Staff were were attentive and friendly. Price per pax is $45++. Total bill with addn charges was $105. There was a 15% discount for DBS cardholders (check on qualifying period). After discount, total bill was $90.

Have not been to ritz carlton after green house went thru a change.Heard from a friend who work there mention a good place for dinner good spread, reasonable price. $68So when I have guest from australia wanted to bring them there but happen to be the F1 race and the price is $98 I thought was rather expensive.In december which is my birthday want to find a nice place to eat so book the line in shangri la. ($62) On the day suddenly I remember I so wanted to experience the colony, so I cancel the line and book the colony instead.($63)No regret, it was so class, food spread was good, food quality was good, service was good (even though the waiter was a student u can tell he was trying his best)That's the kind of food I like even though the spread is large I skip a few station try not to over eat. (skip the indian, timsum, meat station) we order a bottle of red wine too.We had Alaska crab, while eating the waiter chuen poh came around and he told me I should try the laska and chicken rice.I told him okay but I have the chicken without the rice and laska off cause is my favorite and it was really good I enjoyed so much, we actually spend more than 2 hours eating relaxing to me is a beautiful lunch . But it will be perfect if there is fresh oyster too.Many people's said buffet too much to eat. But for me if u select and don't eat too much is also a good meal. You still get your money worth. Somehow while talking I mention it was my birthday, guess what they even bring me a small cake with a candle what a good gesture. Good job.chuen poh

A lot of choice and good quality. The staff were very friendly and provided good care and service. The chefs kept dishing out fresh food and kept up with the stready stream of guests while answering their questions. Everything comes down to the people. Great customer experience
5
Came here for their buffet dinner and am delighted by the wide spread of dishes from starter to main course to desserts. And the quality and taste of the food are both excellent. The ambience of this place is nice too.
4
Seafood selection was good, only lacking raw oysters.
Too many variety to try all. Laksa was great. Rockafella oysters were excellent
Dessert and fruit juice section can be better.
5
The restaurant I booked calls to remind me for my bookings. attends to additional remarks I requested. excellent
5
A memorable party served with great food, great ambience and most importantly great service staffsI would commend on the ❤️ heart warming service by Cory, Tessa and Nina. The ladies took much effort and strong commitment to make the party fun and entertaining. Chef Nicholas and Chef Ang great culinary skills made the guests think about the return food trip. The baked lobster is the hot favorite, followed by the chilli crabs, the cold seafood is next on the list. A great place for celebration. Well done
5
Went there quite some time back for my partner's birthday lunch. It happened to be the day where some international conference was hosted at Ritz and the place was rather filled. We never felt uncomfortable though and the staff was nice enough to arrange for a corner seat when they realized that it was my partner's birthday. Variety and standard of food is superb and service was outstanding. Really enjoyed the experience and will be back again
5
I had an amazing yet pleasant dining experience at Colony.I was so thrilled looking at the wide spread of food selections that I had no idea where to begin with!Having getting my plates and plates of food, I was able to dine in at a peaceful and quaint atmosphere despite the crowd. Service was exceptional and the food was definitely top-notch! Will come back here again :)
5
Went to the buffet and was impressed by the excellent and professional service provided by one of the serving crew, Mr Nazar. He was very friendly and warm, and when we told him we were seated very far from the buffet table, he went the extra mile to bring drinks from the buffet table to our seats. The Colony is very lucky to have a staff like him. You need to let him be the role model for other staff.However, there is this young malay waitress that greeted us and brought us to our table who wasnt flexible to allow us to change our table when we requested a table nearer to the buffet. She was impolite when she rejected our request. Do take action
5
Not generally a big fan of buffet dining but this place is exceptional. Seafood was outstanding, especially the crab and sushi. Also enjoyed the duck, turkey and ham. Didn't have room for the variety of curries and dumplings but they also looked nice. A must have on the deserts was the Taiwanese yam ice cream wraps. Great cocktails and wine selection washed it all down nicely. Service was really good, understated but very efficient.
5
We were all delighted and amazed at the presentation and quality of the food. Food was delicious and beautifully cooked and presented. Our waitress was excellent, polite and friendly and attentive when required. Very nice atmosphere. An interesting venue and worth a visit. Go there and you will go again

This was our first time at the Colony Vintage Champagne Sunday Brunch. We had been a number of times pre- refurbishment when the restaurant was known as the Greenhouse. The brunch then was spectacular, now it is substandard for the price. The quality of the food and the range provided was a huge step down from Greenhouse times. Signage is poor - so many items and stations have no descriptions. I knew through research that there was a station that made soups and laksas, but you wouldn't know that by looking. A poor guest tried to take an item and was curtly told it was to go in a soup, he said he had no idea what was going on. The roast station promoted some meats, but nothing to indicate you could also have the Chinese roast pork or duck as well that were hanging in a corner. None of the petite desserts or ice creams were labelled so the poor 2 chefs that were working that station whilst trying to serve crepes and ice cream were constantly interrupted with queries about the dessert display. As to the free flow champagne - it was great if you could catch someone's attention! And no advice regarding wines or beer which are included in the tariff. The cocktails consisted of Gin & Tonic ( one spirit plus mixer) or a Bloody Mary. In the Greenhouse times you had at least 4 proper cocktails to choose from.  Paying over $1000 for brunch for 5 people you expect good service. We were appalled at the insistence by the waitstaff on putting dirty cutlery back on the table. For example, one of my guests had lobster bisque and left the spoon in the bowl with the remaining bisque. The waiter took out the spoon and put it back on the table. I had curry and the same thing was done with my knife and fork. Were we supposed to lick them clean before the next course? By the time my husband went to get dessert they had actually run out of spoons and had put out plastic teaspoons to eat you ice team with! This is The Ritz, not a hawker centre! We took 3 guests with us and frankly we were embarrassed. Never again. Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere
5
We came here for our dinner after reading great reviews on Tripadvisor. Great food and wine and drinks were fantastic. We did enjoy our dinner here and would highly recommend !
5
From the moment we stepped in...we were greeted by a friendly staff & she actually shown us around before we get started ... Food were delicious & Lots of choices for a weekday buffet...but service even better!
Overall, great time spent @ colony. ☺️

Great reviews on trip advisor prompted me to visit. We were rushed to our table by a hostess who reeled off comments to my wife at 100 mph whilst she was walking to the table. I didn't hear a thing and she didn't take too much in. Our server was more helpful but if you haven't been before please take the time to tell us what's happening! My sense is that it caters very much to the local palette. I found a lot of the food just barely warm and as such not that inspiring. Granted there are western dishes but you can get much better. If you want to stuff yourself to the brim on buffet style food, then this is good value but if you want something more refined then avoid. If I can take any positives away, the shellfish which we had to start and the deserts were good, albeit most of the deserts were cold and it took 3 attempts to warm some apple pie in the oven. Difficult hey! Crepe Suzette very good. Overall for us very average and disappointing. Didn't even ask if we wanted any wine just asked about water. Back to the Club lounge at the hotel for usual first class service.

I celebrated my 42nd birthday at The Colony Ritz Carlton Singapore on 26/11/2016 evening. We had the evening International Buffet there. The food variety, hygiene standard and ambience of the restaurant were excellent. What really impressed me the most was the customer service from your staff "especially Phil" who is a Korean Waiter that served my table. He was exceptionaly polite and patient towards the customers no matter how busy he was. If your looking for good food and good customer service..this place is definetly worth the price you pa
5
Once again, Colony has not failed to disappoint. Lobsters were sweet and succulent, unlike the frozen lobsters on ice served at many other buffets. Lobster bisque was great - neither too thick nor watered down. I asked why there was no roast beef/lamb that night and was told by a Chef Bertram (or Bertrand) that they were serving the Festive menu - so turkey and ham. I was clearly disappointed. 10 minutes later, Chef Bertram showed up at my table with 3 pieces of grilled ribeye - well seasoned, tender and hot off the grill. Now that's great service! Well done, Colony
5
Wide spread of food with great taste. Love the Canadian oysters, need to queue and wait for replenishment but also meant the chef opening and replenishing it when running out. It stay fresh and sweet! The ambience is great and the place totally gorgeous! The service staff were polite and friendly, especially chef Desmond with special introducing of foods and service! Definately worth it but make sure come with a big appetite!

My wife and I chose the Colony to host another couple at dinner and are delighted that we did. The Ritz Carlton has totally renovated the space of the previous Greenhouse Restaurant, and the new decor, featuring open metal screens lined with photographs, provided a lovely setting for an excellent meal. The dinner buffet features a wide array of seafood, sushi, salads, breads, Chinese barbecue, main course items, cheese, and desserts, all delicious and beautifully served. The salad items are especially colorful, while the main courses include a generous combination of Asian (Chinese, Indian, and Malay) and Western dishes, including rack of lamb (made to order) and hand-carved roast beef. The buffet also includes a choice of coffee and tea, unlike many restaurants where these come at an additional charge. This is clearly among the best buffets in Singapore today, well worth the price. We have shared our recommendation with friends and other family members
5
We had nicest buffet dinner here which I have never ever experience before. Great staff and exceptional service. The staff Ken who leaded us to the table was such friendly and helpful. And the guy who service our table was also excellent. Especially the Korean staff Grace, she was surprised us with a lovely cake. Variety of food selection.

Having a party of 21 pax for a birthday celebration back in September 2016.The buffet was little pricy but you are served the best food quality you can expect. The seafood and cold meat section was really fresh, oysters of 2 different region was freshly opened during the serving time.Many of us are overwhelmed with the delicious cuisine available from various different live station. I personally has a little of everything but did not try the pastries and desserts station as there is not enough space in my stomach anymore.Ambience was good but it could get a little noisy when the place is fully booked. The service staffs are friendly but there are a few staffs that may not be very well versed in English but they are trying their best to look after your needs. Overall, it is a good dinning experience

HiI would like to provide feedback on a service staff, Wayne Khor - serving at the Colony.I was at the Colony bakery on 21 Nov with the intention of purchasing some bread at a discounted price. While I understand that the discount for the bakery item is from 7.30pm onwards (I was there at 6.45pm).  I was checking with the staff, Michelle who is managing the bakery if she could make an exception for the purchase before 7.30pmShe declined politely that it is not possible which I have made a request to perhaps check with the manager or supervisor for an exception.I was subsequently referred to a Wayne Khor, which I understand is the supervisor.  While I tried to request for an exception, Wayne's expression and body language was unfriendly, with no smiles, no apology for being unable to accede with the exception.I liked dinning at Ritz as the service staff were excellent and friendly however I was somewhat surprised by Wayne's attitude.  While I understand there is a policy to adhere to, nonetheless it should still be a service with a smile.Disappointed, with the service coming from Ritz Carlton.Regards Elaine Si

Following a revamp and with a new name, this buffet restaurant in Ritz Carlton Hotel offers a cosy venue for gatherings, perfect for festive seasons. Visitors and hotel guests will also be awed by the good spread of authentic local and international cuisines.

We celebrated my father in law's birthday here as a family. They found it relaxing, wide variety of food including local food. Best is the ambience if you are looking for a fancy 5 star hotel. Lots of natural light and tables are further apart. Service here is excellent with attentive staff. We were served by Ellie. If you're celebrating a birthday, call in advance for a complimentary cake! For Singapore at this price point for high end hotels, it's pretty good. Ask to see whether you can qualify for a 10% discount with a credit card.

I made a dinner reservation for 6 pax to dine in on 27 Aug 16. Prior to the dinner, I had sent in an email to request for a little surprise to my son and it was being agreed that a small cake will be arranged for my birthday boy. On the day of dinner, no cake or surprise was given. At 9pm, I approached one of the waitresses to enquire about my request and she said "will check". After half an hour later, nothing happens and I check with another waitress. At 9.45pm, we were given a molten chocolate cake taken from one of the buffet item to be a "surprise" cake. From the whole incident, I would assume that my prior request was not taken seriously despite the written request and this definitely left us a very bad impression for the service level of the hotel. At the same time, the waitresses on the day were not very attentive as well.One more thing to mention, the light of the hall was turned dim around 9plus which give me the impression that they are ready to chase you off your dinner table.....

Often come here for the dinner buffet which is absolutely the best in town. The selection is fantastic, the quality always top notch and the service is impeccable. The staff truly delivers on the Ritz-Carlton spirit with a smile and always goes above and beyond. A special shoutout to Sage from the team. I love the space and the decor of the redesigned restaurant, the atmosphere is very warm and inviting. The wonderful food selection never disappoints. Great value for money.

This is my second time dining in Colony and always a pleasure! Raj is very attentive and always ready o serve! He makes our day with his funny jokes and we couldn't stop laughing. Thank you Raj for making our dinning experience enjoyable! Hope to be back soon! Thank you!

Especially pleased with a gentleman by the name of Ratesh (?) who is very cheerful and friendly despite having to attend to so many diner

This time I brought my parents n brother and his family along. They love ❤️ Colony as much as I do. I do admit it is not tat affordable for frequent dinning but once awhile or special occasion is worth paying. ✌️️Usually I dun eat wanton mee or tim sum on buffet. They are either too hard or tasteless. However Colony serves yummy dishes range fm chinese to jap to international. Laksa is a must to eat always but a bit disappointed for last 9 as it taste too spicy. Hot hot hot!!! Chilli crab is yummy and they serve with soft steam bun!!! The refill is fast too. Dun need rush ah! Juices!!! OMG, u name it they have it. Dun have they will freshly squeeze for u!!! Where to find? Self selection n order to cook pasta was abit oily but I appreciate the chef was trying his best to cook. Suggestion is should have 2 stove or 2 chef cooking. Waiting time, 15 mins to have my pasta. Dessert selections are wide too. I always love their ice cream. Sorbet also shiok!!! They have tis order to make lava coco cake. Yummy!!! Well, never too full for dessert! Well the list goes on. Most impt is they really carry out Ritz Carlton motto, people serving people. I always enjoy the ambience, service and wide selection of food. Staff are always smiley and reaponsiveSadly... abit disappointed with 1 of the ac-hod chef yesterday - Dennis, at the noodle station. "Dear chef, I din realise u are so engage cooking the noodle for ur so call mrs so and so. I am sorry din meant to interrupt ur cooking. Ur loud and firm reply - a moment pls repeatly, make me alittle uncomfy lah.I am sorry I may have disturb u or meant to be the kiasu customer. Reason I repeat myself as I did not feel u respond willingly to my order. Pai sei ah!"Thanks Colony for always giving me wonderful experience. Love u guys!!!

My folks really enjoyed it and requested that we go back, however, we were a little disappointed this time round. My folks complained that the quality of the fresh seafood selection (for Saturday Lunch) has gone down. Specifically, they are of the opinion that perhaps they had made it exceedingly salty to prevent excessive consumption by patrons. Apart from that, we were satisfied with the good service, excellent ambience and wide selection of food. There is also a 15% discount with DBS credit card.

My top choice of local buffet restaurant for these reasons1) Great service - allow my special needs child to have simple porridge at min charges2) Very high food quality even though we are talking about local food3) Love the dessert spread - fantastic quality4) Great ambience and has elegance5) Every birthday person is givena special trea

I wish I was reviewing Colony after having a dining experience in the restaurant but that is not the case in this instance. I have been emailing a number of high end restaurants in Singapore over the last 10 days or so to enquire about dining options for Christmas. I had dined at the restaurant before when it was Greenhouse and was impressed with their Sunday Champagne Brunch. I particularly liked the idea of dining at Colony as they had two sittings for their Christmas Day Brunch and the option to not go until 1.30 pm appealed to me. So, even though I was emailing a number of establishments, I really hoped to be able to dine at Colony. I emailed Colony at the Ritz Carlton to enquire. I received no reply. Equinox at Swissotel the Stamford responded to my email, Brasserie Les Saveurs at the Four Seasons responded, Melt at Mandarin Oriental responded. Every restaurant I emailed responded, and not only did they respond, they responded promptly. I was disappointed I had not heard from Colony so sent an additional email enquiring about their brunch on Christmas Day. That was a couple of days ago. Again, no response. I ended up making and paying for a reservation at one of the establishments who were polite enough to respond to me and am now happy with my decision to do so. I would now have little faith in Colony being able to organize a decent Christmas Day brunch if they don't have the organizational skills required to respond to potential customer's emails

Awesome food, co operative staff, well interior n well managed, varieties of desserts n special Birthday cake at last ( as per recommend while booking a table

We have a great service at colony tonight by Ms Siti . She served us with great passion !!! Well done Siti and we will e back again ... The place is cosy too for gatherin
5
Fabulous food, 5 star service. Friendly helpful wait staff who went out of their way to make a birthday brunch a very special occasion. Lovely MoÃ«t, constant refills.

One of the best buffets I've had in Singapore! Great assortment of food and all served hot and fresh. Signature dishes include the Laksa with lobster meat, chilli crab, and the assorted sashimi. Best part, 3 types of oysters from 3 different countries! Ambience was cosy, not too bright but not too dimly light as well. Special thanks to Raj, for his wonderful service and constantly coming to check on us and crack some jokes. My partner and i didn't feel the time pass and we sat there eating and chatting until it was last order! Definitely recommended!

Entrance to this place could be a bit confusing if it is your first time there, just ask for directions when you enter the hotel.I love the ambiance and layout of the food. Selections were great and food quality can be a hit or miss. Overall the live stations are pretty save to go for. It is definitely fresher. Things i wish could be better are the juice/drinks selections, they are also kind of hidden at a corner. The Hot food standard is surprisingly not the best. It seems like some of the food has been left out there for a while and the quality was compromised. I love the appetizers and desserts selection a lot more. Service was really good, my apologies for not being able to remember their names but there were 2 Korean servers, 1 gentlemen and 1 lady who really stood out to me. They were very friendly and efficient. As the restaurant was not packed, it was pretty quiet and i was worried our group of 7 could be a little too loud as well. Lighting could be slightly brighter to give us a better idea of what we are consuming at our table. Overall, this is a buffet that is definitely worth your time to visit
4
We really enjoyed our dinner at the Colony. Reason it is not a 5 is related to the price. Slightly high price in balancing all the factors: selection, quality, etc. Service was quite good. Most of the food was with a couple exceptions such as king crab and pasta choice. Desert choices were average and limited. Overall a very good choice though it did not clearly define itself as "the best" in Singapore. (As context the Ritz Carlton is my favorite hotel in .
3
As the title says the food cant be knocked, the bill for just two of us came close to $300 with just the buffet, 1 beer, 1 cocktail. So a bit more expensive than its made out to be, just be aware of some of the deserts, as if you have any allergies such as myself (peanuts) it's not labeled up and I bit into what I was told was a Apple treat with chocolate, then to find out it was filled with chunky peanut butter. I had a pretty bad allergic reaction the following day
5
It was a great dinner with friends. Food was sublime, fresh and various, all tasty and simple prepared. I really enjoyed it. I loved the indian food, chicken curry and the red lamb curry, plenty of choices, lobsters, oysters, and sea food fresh and nice.The only negative side was the wine, either red or white, it was not at the level of the food. I do believe that for such dinner a better wine could just make it perfect
5
Dined at the Colony on 29 October 2016 to celebrate three of our family members' birthdays and it was as usual, never to disappoint and only to exceed expectations. Raj and his team delivered the exemplary service that is recognisable as part of Ritz Carlton's high standards around the world. Sundar from the Indian station was extremely enthusiastic and shared his vast knowledge about Indian cuisine with us. He also surprised us with an Indian desert specially made for the special occasion. The staff were at the same time extremely attentive to my grandmother and served her soft food suited to her.It was great visiting the Colony and will continue making it our regular place for dining, whether casual or celebratory. Once again, thank you to all at the Colony and look forward to returning really soon

My husband and I booked for the Sunday brunch over the long weekend and we are so happy we choose here.Brunch is served from 12pm to 3.30pm in the Colony Restaurant. We were grated and served by friendly and helpful staff.There is a wide selection of food from seafood, chilled meats, salads, different main courses and plenty of desserts. Included in the brunch is Moet Champagne, white or rose, with cocktails, wine or beer. I would say this is more suitable for adults only.I highly recommend coming here for brunch
5
 Thanks to Ken Fong, the dinner experience at the colony was elevated to that befitting of the Ritz. He was ever the professional, yet with the personal touch that beams of warmth and assurance of excellent service. He is a gem, polished and precious to the Ritz.The chilly crab rivals that of seafood restaurants, while the oysters and cold prawns are as fresh as can be. Be sure not to lose out on the fabulous desserts and the signature lobster laksa.A dinner worth saving up for!
4
Terrific and good welcome service. Waitress service is also excellent. The buffet spread is average. A lot of cooked frozen food but the bread quality and selection is very good. The Chinese Roast Meat is a let down. The dining experience is marred by the poor service of the chef who station at the Chinese Roast Meat. He chased me away and serve another customer even when I had queued at the front for a long time

My family and I went for birthday dinner for Melinne aged 8 yrs at Colony on 22 Oct 2016. I would like to compliments a staff that was assigned to take care of our table. He is Ming Wei. Not only was he fast in his service, throughout the dining experience he always have a smiling face for everyone. He is the best service staff i have seen for a long time. I also would like to compliment Rethish for his efforts to ensure we had a good time and drop by often to check on us as he did to other guests also which i observed..Thank you Colony for having such wonderful staff and making our dining experience unforgetable and our 2 young daughters very happy that i lost count how many times they said thank you to Ming Wei... Our first dining trip in Sep for birthday dinner also for Melissa age 10 yrs was not so good as we literally had to wave and try to catch anyone' attention but this oct visit just make up for the unpleasant time we had in Sept..Thank you..Yvonne Yeoh9223332

The afternoon tea includes a glass of champagne and a box of savvy bikes. The sweet bikes are of buffet type. They serve abalone on xiaolongbao from the savvy bikes and it is of reasonable size. The crepes from the dessert section are freshly made, the process is fun to watch and entertaining, especially when they pour the wine on to the crepes and ignite them. It is very interesting to see the fire burning on the crepes. At for the lunch buffet, it is of high quality in terms of the food. They use extra large tiger prawns in their cold seafood section and some other sections with seafood. However, they would only provide a limited amount of those juicy prawns and switch back to regular grey prawns when they refill. If you are a prawn lover, go for the tiger prawns first before they run out.

We went for lunch and was amazed by the buffet. We were originally going Ã  la Carte but changed to the Buffett option. The service was poor, we had eaten our 2nd helping before a drinks order was taken. Wish we'd know about the Buffet before as we'd booked the table for 1:15pm and the Buffet finished at 2pm. We ate plenty but would have been nice to have a leisurely lunch. Brilliant value for what you get, shame the service let in down
5
Excellent ambience and service. Seafood spread was impressive. Good Spread at the hot food section too
5
I heard about this buffet from my good friends.My husband & I made the booking & went there. The buffet was amazing.Lots of delicious food from 5 different types of oysters from France, Ireland & New Zealand, prawns, Alaskan crab, lobster, Singaporean crabs, sashimi, sushi, salads, bread, dim sum, various kind of soups including laksa, Indian food, chinese food, sate, desserts ... so many more.The service was very good too.
5
Fabulous food selection and nice ambience. Great dining experience with attentive staff @ Josphine n Jonathan Hon
4
Excellent buffet indeed, but this remains a buffet and an expensive one. If you prefer quality to quantity there has to be better options around
4
Beautiful and recommended. Faultless table service only let down when we went to pay, we seemed to have forgotten us. Totally food fusion from oysters to curries, chocolates to fruit teas! All taste buds catered for.
5
The Victoria Sunday Brunch at Colony restaurant at Ritz Carlton Hotel is a true "WOW" experience. We celebrated a special occasion, and could not have picked a better place: the quality and range of food on offer, the presentation and ambiance as well as the attentiveness and excellence in service provided by the staff simply floored us. We had high expectations, but these were far exceeded by the superb brunch experience the Colony offers. This is true luxury: no false pretenses, but simply the best of the best in terms of brunch experience one can find in Singapore. And all offered in a classy yet very relaxed atmosphere - absolutely recommended for that special occasion, and if you need to spoil yourself and/or others. Just: "WOW"
5
Came here with my sister on last friday, the crowds as usual always full house with all great variety of food, service was excellent from the hostess to the station and well taken care by Raj & Sage.I must compliment both of them because i was impressed by the service & they are very attentive.I can see they serve guest with heart. It will be nice to have 2x choice of satay meat instead only 1 choice of lamb satay.The variety of dessert need more improvement - some local dessert to be added in that would be great.eg - Nyonya Kuih and Waffles Overall experience is good, nice ambience and the new design of the restaurant.Definitely will intro to my friend to choose Colony as their first choice for dining
5
Bruch at the Ritz Carlton is an experience that you will never forget. Fabulous buffet with the highest of quality offering and of course champagne makes it more than complete.
5
Colony has every type of cuisine/ food you would expect. The best Buffett restaurant I have ever visited ( and I have been to a few!!) wonderful service, atmosphere and mostly food. It is expensive for wine, but the food is sensational! Wonderful fresh seafood- highly recommended
5
Came here on last night of singapore trip. Loved it! Great variety of food. Lobster ball laksa to die for! Omg the satat chicken skewers were heavenly! Popiah made fresh! Service was excellent! Best dinner in my trip to Singapore!
4
I ate at Colony for breakfast. I hadn't been to the restaurant since it was renovated and changed. It is now mess up market than previously. The buffet was quite extensive. The crowd was more touristy than business. It however wasn't cheap for what you got. Wouldn't be my preferred choice for a more formal breakfast meeting around this area.
5
My wife and I attended the buffet to celebrate her birthday. what an amazing experience, Gene Del Barrio, assistant manager and the team could not have been more helpful. The food was exquisite and the selection immense. Highlights include lobster, chilly crab and the biggest oysters I have ever seen. Whilst it may seem expensive, it is excellent value for money. Great atmosphere and will definitely return
5
Lunch at Colony is a fantastic introduction for visitors to Singapore to the amazing multicultural food this tiny island holds. The service, the light-filled rooms, and the huge variety of stations does not disappoint. We used to bring people to Straits Kitchen, and the food there is great but you can't get around the fact that you are eating in a windowless mall. Colony is gorgeous, modern, and sun-drenched. While Straits Kitchen may have the edge on authentic Singaporean dishes, for ambiance Colony is a winner
5
The Colony was a great place for a Friday night family dinner. With a great environment and friendly waiting staff that catered to all needs quickly. The chef, Teck Soon cooked up savoury dishes and the buffet selection was plentiful with many choices. I suggest looking out for Rethish, as he serves you with an experience which would have you returning again
5
It was a beautiful experience to be sharing a dinner with my friends here. Is a very nice restaurant and amazing food. The environment was very bright and lively. Champagne was great and free flowing nicely

I've been here a couple of times when it was previously Greenhouse and was pretty excited to visit now that it has been revamped. Came for a Saturday lunch with my family (6 of us) and we were seated at the brightly lit centre area, near the appetizer buffet. It was very busy and the restaurant was full. The decor is really pretty and well thought out, although some areas near the buffet are quite narrow. Food-wise i loved the selection of meats, cheeses and appetizers (smoked salmon with gravlax yum!) , and the drinks/juices station was a nice touch (loved the raspberry iced tea!). The mains were good, beef a little tough, variety was just nice i felt. I thought desserts were quite average in selection and taste, and could be improved. Service was excellent, we were served by Hong and she was very gracious and has a great memory - got everyone's customized coffee orders right
5
It is a mark of how well this brunch is run that despite the restaurant being full, one never feels rushed or cramped, nor does one experience any bottlenecks at any of the serving stationsThe quality of the offerings is very good, and the very relaxed ambience encourages you to take a leisurely approach to your meal, enjoying it course by coursethe stunner for me was the cheese station, which was easily the best selection of cheese I have seen since my lunch at the Waterside Inn at Bray some years ag
3
we tried the Saturday lunch buffet on around early August, i went there with some guest total 8 of us to celebrate my daughter birhtday, the spread of the foods was quite extensive.. however the quality of the food and service, I think for such outstanding hotel like Ritz Carlton could do much better...Maybe because of the high rank they get at tripadvisor, that's why my expectation was very high....the sashimi on that day weren't very fantastic.. the way they cut it's quite thin, the pasta counter I noticed the chef wasn't quite friendly when I told him that I wanted lesser pasta, the way to cook the pasta, etc etc.. it's like he was so rush and unhappy or tense to take our pasta order, not only I noticed, but my friends too.we love the grill counter, and their indian food section were quite good... the place is very comfortable and cosy, it's a nice place to invite some guests..
5
Afternoon tea at the Colony offers an amazing array of fine pastry and desserts. It has got minimal savory and more sweet stuffs. The ambience is unbeatable. Set on the newly renovated hall with lots of sunlight. There's the ice cream corner with great gelatos as well. U can choose between the afternoon tea set or the buffet. I highly recommend buffet though the set comes with caviar, just spoilt yourself with the amazing buffet that is high in quality as well. I also notice if the run out of the items on the set, they will replace it with those on the buffet table. Overall a good deal as a spread like this usually cost more but the price is competitive given the quality and ambience
5
The food was great! Give us compliments from chef. Alaskian king crab was perfect. Service staff were very good
5
Choose this restaurant to celebrate my hubby birthday on 16 October 2016 based on the review. Was super impress by the service the moment we step in the restaurant.Wide range of food selection but too bad we can't possible to try all.We would like to thanks Angeline, very outstanding service she provided to us and other customers. For sure we will return again for some other celebration. Keep it up
4
Colony has very good spread of quality food. Their sashimi and cold crab is very fresh and sweet. Has very nice ambience. The only feedback is the dessert which has room for improvement.
5
We recently had a large family gathering at the Colony Restaurant. The restaurant arranged two large tables for our group. The food and service was amazing
5
The sunday buffet here is simply out of this world. It has such variety and everything is delicious. The atmosphere is relaxed but elegant. Make it a special day, put on one of your special outfits and feel glamerious while enjoying the food and pamparing
5
One of the best buffets I have ever tried. Also their restaurant is very classy and cozy. The restaurant's variety of food is unique and everything tasted good.
5
arrived just after 6:30 and many tables were already seated and eating! they probably open slightly before 6:30 even to Really give u ample time to eat and rest-pretty awesome in my opinion. first up, some warm soups and salads. the "local" boiled soup was old cucumber and though not as rich as ones you may get at proper chinese restaurants, was not bad to warm us up. the lobster bisque was alright as well, some found it very rich, others thought it a little watered down (but each to their own in this category i feel!) was great with some of the bread options - the staff suggested baguette or a light small roll, but i like it with the surprisingly tasty gluten free focacia!!the salads, cold cuts and cold seafood came next. same as the lunch with a good selection of greens and edible plants, lovely mushrooms!! the cured meats were also a delight. no sandwiches like at lunch though but probably less suitable as this was dinner anyway.the lobster claw was ok, didn't try it as someone else mentioned the meat was a little too soft. the alaskan crab was great though it thought! maybe a bit on the salty side but through the salt i could definitely taste sweet sweet meat! the oysters as well! there were 4 different types available and 3 of them were definitely tip top in freshness and taste (maybe that 4th one was a little off, not too sure). prawns also super sweet and succulent.the sashimi was good standard for hotel buffet with tasty sushi for those who don't mind the extra rice. i packed on the salmon though! but moving on to the warm food....the salmon on croute was probably one of the highlights!! as was the gigantic tomahawk steak in bone, and later in the night they actually changed the cut to a hunky sirloin? or possibly tenderloin? wasn't sure but was decent again for a buffet style (i think i preferred their tomahawk though, more tender and juicy next to the ribs). baked lobster was ok but grilled prawns definitely more of a standout. the chinese section and indian was decent but nothing to shout about. laksa great as usual.desserts! fresh fruits great, juices ok. crepes and ice cream very tasty!! esp the gula melaka! little pastries - best was the hazelnut dome on a small cake base (eat the bursting dome) and the chocolate tart. others inc some lemon tarte, banana mousse (also good). there was molten lava choc cake but ran out fast! delish w ice cream. all in all, not a cheap meal but WELL WORTH COST AND CALORIES!
5
The food was delicious! Give my compliments to the chef! Especially to Zahren, we appreciate your attention to detail when you answered our questions. You're more helpful than you realize.You light up the room.Thank you for the extra mile that you put into this effort. It was one of the best place we have visited
5
Great food, and I don't mean "given it is a buffet, the food is great", but the quality of the food is spot on, even the sashimi and lobster has been perfect every time we went to get some. We were not happy that we had asked for a quiet table and were in fact placed in an awkward spot. Also, when we were there, we were really annoyed by some practices of a few Chinese men such as loading their plate with 8 (!) lobsters cleaning the entire lobster table at once when there were 20 people queuing for lobster, just insanely inconsiderate. This happened more than once in the short time I was queuing, just crazy.Also, choice of drinks could have been better (teas, soft drinks etc). Apart from that, great meat selection, amazing desserts (!), good sushi and sashimi, even tasty olives, which are otherwise a hard find in Singapore..
5
Visited on 2 October with family. This is my second visit to Colony within three months. We love the ambience and privacy we get throughout the meal. We booked this place on the day itself and had requested a complimentary birthday cake. Staff fulfilled our request on a seat with more privacy & the last minute birthday cake without frills. Food is superb. We love everything there especially the fresh oyster and roasted delights. Various kinds of dessert is a MUST TRY too. Staffs are all very polite&attentive. Special thanks to Rethish, he got sense of humor and gave us a good laugh. He did his best to give us the utmost satisfaction. We really appreciate it. This is my number one place to go for buffet for sure. I wish I could go back again for my birthday celebration which is at the end of the year!!
4
Service staff were attentive, despite it being the weekend and a packed restaurant. Requests were promptly met with and always with a smile. Food was good. Especially oysters from France. And not forgetting the ice cream too. Don't let the hordes of greedy customers spoil your appetite. The food is that good, that's why. Table side cocktail is also available. The trainee that served us did her best and we also had the chance to mix the drinks ourselves. Overall a great experience Bring your kids and your family!
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our evening here. We chose the buffet with its amazing choices. The staff were attentive and we particularly enjoyed Raj's humour. We had a booth which was nice and private. Thoroughly recommended
5
Food is great, the alaskan king crab in particular exceeded our expectation. Special mention to Harvey for his exceptional service as we were with a toddler and he was always there to help us clean up or keep the baby occupied
5
Was dining on a Sunday dinner at the Colony on 2nd of October with my family of four. As the restaurant was a little bigger compared to the ones I've tried previously at other 5 star hotels, the staffs at the entrance were really kind and courteous to seat us down to our table. The food was really good as they had a large range of varieties from local to western to Japanese foods and not to forget the seafood section as well. As their food were really fresh and tender. The ambience and atmosphere was really good as well as clean, the theme of the restaurant indeed looks like a colony and I would like to also complement on Chef Kelly Tay and also Restaurant manager Retish as their service towards us and other guests whom dine at the colony were being very attentive and brought us around the restaurant to show us around from the selection of foods as one of my mates had allergy to some ingredients. All in all a very good dining experience at the colony and would definitely be back for more in the future as this is one of the best buffet restaurant I've tried so far.
5
We celebrated our 47th wedding anniversary here. The staff were attentive and the food was delicious, and the ambience suited to a quiet evening
5
My husband and I celebrated our 3rd anniversary at Colony and had the best experience there! We had the most attentive service from Raj, one of the managers. He was friendly, polite and attentive, making sure we enjoyed our anniversary celebration. The food was amazing too
4
We came to The Colony restaurant tonight for our 8th Wedding Anniversary. We initially chose it as we had our 10yr old daughter with us and needed to ensure there would be something that she would like to eat also. From the moment we arrived the service was impeccable. In particular, I would like to mention our waiter Harvey who went out of his way to make sure everything was perfect at all times. There was an incredibly large selection of food on offer. My daughter went back to the dumpling section several times and the chef was wonderful in helping her. The array of seafood was impressive as was the variety of food from all parts of the world (braised pork in vinegar was devine). There was one section that was the stand-out for me however, The dessert area. Wow!!!!!! I cannot begin to describe the attention to detail, mouth watering taste and the beautiful presentation. It may be pricey for a buffet, but this is no ordinary buffet. With waiters there to assist you in every way and food that is devine I cannot recommend it enough. I think we will be back to try the High Tea based on reviews here. Thank you to the staff, especially Harvey for such a memorable and happy evening - you are what makes us come back to Singapore time and time again
5
The decor and atmosphere are great, the staff are very attentive and the menu offers such a great variety of dishes and a beautiful high tea option which is quite a level above sandwiches, scones and cupcakes. It offers some exquisite bites and the pastries and cakes are such pretty little artworks. My Colonial basket of treats arrived quite late but I had a glass of bubbly and a beautiful selection of mini cakes to enjoy while waiting for it
5
Sage was so good to my sister and I during our dinner dining experience! She was friendly, courteous, helpful, and professional. She even recommended a dish despite being at a buffet and went out of her way to help us order it! Sage took time to get to know us and we felt like she really cared about our experience at the Colony. We highly recommend sitting in her section. :) Thanks Sage

askd for more chicken rice. chef said scared not enough rice for customers later. am I nt yr customer? asked for spagetti, said stall nt yet opened when buffet starts at 12pm
4
The selection of foods is good and attentive servicing. Dessert was just awesome and nice comfy dining experience
5
Just had champagne brunch here and I'm totally awed by the wide variety & excellent quality of the food and impeccable service of the staffs here especially Ken, who had always make sure that we are served well. He even showed us around to introduce the many types of food offered by the esteemed restaurant. The ambience here is really great. They served really good desserts too by a French chef... one of our favorite in the menu. Will definitely come again...
5
Excellent cheese selection - in French u say they are "bien affinÃ©s". Six kinds of oysters from Ireland, New Zealand and France.Gorgeous seafood bar - lobster claws, clams, mussels..
5
With all other hotels offering champagne brunches with a smorgasbord of food offerings, it's pretty hard to beat the ritz carlton and their Sunday brunch. Quality is top notch: from the 5 varieties of oysters all the way to the crepe Suzette, you know it's the creme de la creme when they offer you 5 different varieties of toppings just for the dessert. And the unmistakable signature service of ritz carlton makes the experience all the more memorable, thanks to captain Tessa and Harvey especially. They turn the brunch experience into a human one, rather than just a functional occupation. Kudos to them for exemplifying the ritz carlton experience with their ever attentive checking on our gastronomical feast and on clearing the finished plates. On a separate note, it's fantastic to see that dedicated and hardworking staff like Tessa are still serving at the Ritz. Valuable staff like her need to be recognised for making this experience the pinnacle of singapore's Sunday brunch experiences
4
Waiters and Waitresses are friendly and polite. Limited choice of Japanese food, soba is not available. More choice of Asian food will be nice.
5
Food is excellent and in good value. Worthy to eat again. The services is good as well and location is very easy to find
5
It was a beautiful experience to be sharing a dinner with my friends here. Is a very nice restaurant and amazing food.
I recommend this site!!
5
Brunch was absolutely fantastic, and the staff were brilliant. The environment is very bright and lively. Champagne was great and free flowing nicely. Only at one point was the seafood section overly crowded. Photos speak for themselves. Will definitely be going back.
5
Celebrated a belated birthday lunch today for a good friend at The Colony, Ritz Carlton Singapore. This is my 5th visit and each time was impressed. The service today was especially attentive as we were looked after by a young Malay gentleman, NAZAR who really had initiative and provided the Ritz's service with a smile! The food as always very good standard and consistent. Chef Chuah at the roast meat station also impressed us with his knife skills, presenting beautifully cut roast duck and roast pork to us! Well done everyone and keep up the good work

I have eaten at Colony a couple of times over the past two months - the first of which was in May with friends that were leaving Singapore. We had heard the restaurant had been re-furbished, so we decided to head down for the evening dinner buffet. The food selection was really good, there was a generous seafood counter (which was refilled right up until closing time), a great indian curry station and a made-to-order desert bar. Overall, we thought this place was great value for money, and it felt a bit more classy than some of the other island buffets we have been too... we visited again in August 2016
5
been a couple of times and found the new look very interesting. A great selection of food with something i feel for everyone. the waiting staff have always been very helpful, really enjoyable food and at a more realistic price. only criticism is that the fruit juice station shouldn't be serving juice in hot out of the washer glasses
5
I always look forward a lunch or dinner at Colony with its unique elegant atmosphere. The spread is pretty wide with Indian, Chinese, peranakan, Japanese and western options. One can feel that the quality of the product there is very high, products seem to be selected carefully and I totally trust their sashimi buffet. Delicious desserts as well with fine taste and delicate presentation

This was my pick for a public holiday buffet lunch with the family.The place is definitely a good upgrade from the old greenhouse. Still bright and airy but in a more sophiscated tone and ambience. More cosy sofa seats than previously. But less space for service staff or even guests to walk around in. Buffet spread was huge, with plenty to eveything to keep people happy. The spacious layout also made it seem not as crowded as it is. Seafood was fresh, desserts delicate and mostly sublime, and a dizzling selection of hot dishes (indian, chinese etc), fresh juices, freshly baked carbs. The choices seem endless, and all done very tastefully. But service could be a bit more refined I felt. Plates were not cleared frequently and I found myself having to bring my plates to the staff instead. Staff also did not allow me to take pics of the stations before they opened the buffet at 12noon sharp. Very strange. But kuods to them for preparing a very nice lava cake for a little boy's birthday which made him very happy
5
For the start, you are most likely impressed by the gorgeous interior which ties to its colonial theme. Images from different Imperial colonies of England beautifully placed with similar decoration to take you back to the times of vintage glamor. The buffet dinner spread is by far the best I ever tasted. Despite my food limitations due to my pregnancy, I enjoyed the wide variety of food choices while I watched my husband savour every bite. The dinning experience was special for the both of us.I stepped out of Colony feeling much heavier (with a full belly) and perhaps with a subtle sense of royality
5
My companion and I dined at Colony on a Wednesday night for a special occasion and we weren't disappointed! Raj and his staff should be commended on their service, which was top notch. The ambience was lovely-we were assigned a table off to the side, which made it a lot quieter. The variety of dishes offered were fantastic, particularly the seafood. My friend returned for a second plate of prawns and oysters (and contemplated a third!!), they were so delicious. The laksa was also lovely, but the chilli crab was just so-so. The Indian selection was delicious, especially the naan, (3 different varieties) and the tandoori chicken was very tender. There was also a fantastic array of salads, vegetables and roast meat-just make sure you leave room for dessert though, which I guarantee you'll visit more than once! Overall, it was definitely worth the money. Well done Colony-we'll be back
5
Our family had a nice dinner at colony. Good service and ambience. Would like to give a good review on one staff "Phil". Outstanding service and good positive attitude.
5
Really enjoyed our time here for a small birthday celebration. The cooked dishes are delicious and desserts were exquisite!
4
This is one of the best buffet I have tried in Singapore. Definitely worth it.The variety is good and the quality of food is very good.Some of my favourite: Alaskan Crab, tiramisu, selection of bread, selection of cheese.There are also lots of cooked food- Indian, Chinese, stir fry, roast beef, chicken rice, spaghetti etc, definitely spoilt for choices.Kids below 6 years old eat for free and there is a couple of credit card with 10-15% off.If you are looking for place for special celebration, I think this is one of the choices
5
Love how sincere Phil has provided service to my family throughout the whole buffet, and created a wonderful experience for my mum as she celebrated her 60th birthday here.Thank you Phil!:
4
This place is excellent. Good service and great food. It could be the most extensive Buffett I've ever seen - almost any type of food you could hope for. I'm not a Buffett type of guy but this is different and the most affordable means of eating. Mains start at $28 - 40 SGD but the Buffett is $48 for all the cold selection and $78 for the hot plus desserts. Again - the quality is excellent and I tried my hardest to eat them out of tuna sashimi without success. For the two of us, two Singapore slings, half a carafe of wine, one cold Buffett, one hot Buffett and a bottle of sparkling water = $310 SGD. Not at all "cheap" but then again neither are the surrounds, food or staff.
4
Reasonable buffet but drinks are very expensive (that's just Singapore!).Food from India, Italy, England, China, Singapore and Japan. Probably more but that's what we had.Service was nothing special, had to go up to cashier to order drinks and to get the bill as we were being ignored. Seems to be a popular place so worth booking
5
Not usually a big fan of buffets but Colony felt more like a fine dining restaurant with unlimited food especially for the desserts. Great atmosphere, service is outstanding and the food options are amazing. Wait staff are very attentive and regularly come by to take plates and make sure you have enough water throughout the night which is a small detail but a detail many other restaurants just don't get. Overall, just had a great evening and was very full by the end of the night. Would be back again and recommend to anyone in stopping over in Singapore
4
The decoration is amazing. Staffs are very friendly.I am not too fond of Singaporean food, but was very happy to find fresh oysters, sushi and sashimi here
3
Beautiful ambiance, good service, huge selection of food, including a ton of desserts. One issue: they use way too much salt & MSG to enhance the flavor in their food. For most people, this means, you will feel extremely thirsty the next day as your body tries to flush it out
5
This isn't your standard buffet where they make the dish fast just to meet demand. Every single dish had effort put into it and tastes like it too. Highly recommend, just come early so you don't rush the desserts :)
5
Not the greatest variety of foods but quality is unsurpassed. A great place for visitors to Singapore to try out all the local delights in a timelessly chic dining room filled with natural light.
3
My 3rd visit in 5 months.Sushi counter was unexciting; served simpler items, and no longer providing uni and egg roe. Do avoid the Har Kaw and Png Kueh (pink rice cake); skins were too thick.Having said, staff continued to be very professional and friendly; best asset of the restaurant. Oysters, Poh piah, laksa, baked lobsters and desserts were great.
4
A good place to try all the delicious cuisine offered, there is an International buffet plus all the Singaporean specialities eg. chilli crabs, Singapore laksa and a big range of Indian food. The sea food is amazing and also the desert counter is something to die for if you are desert person. The restaurant is good for lunch ,dinner and breakfast. You don't have to go out to eat if you stay in this hotel as the food here is fabulous
4
We love the newly reno and the seafoods are so fresh & nice. Local food like beef satay also a good try. A lot of choice on fresh fruits, be it cut or whole. Really worth lunch-ing there, will visit again next time
5
The wide spread of food was enough to entice my taste buds, not to mention the quality of the food that was being served. Accompanied by the newly revamped interior of the dining area, I was able to enjoy my meal in an enjoyable and relaxed ambience. Topped off with the excellent service by the staffs, I am definitely coming back for more!
5
The buffet was awesome.We had a departmental lunch in Colony. 36 of us, everything was coordinated smoothly. Thank you Hui Yu, you are professional.Must try the ice bar – snow crabs, clams, prawns etc., and the sashimi, popiah, laksa, sandwiches… GOOD variety and quality.Wonderful atmosphere. And, I love the blueberry ice tea!With HSBC 15% discount, we shall be back
2
All I can say is that we were very disappointed with the overall experience I am not going to go into detail as the issues were rectified at the time by the Manager
5
We were well taken care of by Nina.. Warm, friendly and professional.. She deserves a pat on the back for a job well done.. Food was great but the services was was made the whole dining experiences wonderful.
4
My daughter and I had lunch here last Sunday, we had booked a table, but the restaurant couldn't find our booking, but accommodated us without problem. We were given an Aperol cocktail and given a lovely booth by the window.There is a lot of variety here, and I certainly didn't do it justice. The oysters are from various regions in France and are freshly shucked in front of you. The prawns and crab legs, although plentiful, are frozen and so retain a watery texture. I don't understand why you'd serve frozen seafood, I presume it's cost prohibitive to supply the amount they require any other way.There's a wide range of sashimi and sushi, and various fresh vegetables and salad ingredients including asparagus and fresh mozzarella.For meat lovers, there are many options including roast pork, lamb, beef, cooked in various ways, and a vast array of international hot food such as prawn curry, fish etc. There are a few stand out options such as pan fried foie gras, and an incredible cheese platter with some stunning French cheeses.Desserts have their own stand, and as expected, are beautifully presented with many different choices. All this washed down with endless Moët Brut or Rosé makes for a very chilled out Sunday brunch.Most normal people wouldn't be able to try everything offered at the Sunday Brunch tables at Colony, although the family next to our table certainly gave it a good try! After going through all the courses from seafood to dessert, they started it all over again!About AUD$220 per head, when taken in context though, if you drink an entire bottle of Moët each, which we probably did, it's not too bad
5
Raj and his team had been really helpful and treated us with genuine care! We felt really at home and comfortable at Colony. Raj popped by every once in a while at appropriate times and cracked some jokes which we found really friendly. The team is attentive to our needs and it made our experience a great one. We will recommend this place for its quality food and service with a special touch.
5
Great food! Great service! Kudos to Mr Raj.
He was really funny and he gives first class services! Thank you for a wonderful dining experience.

I write to recount my wonderful experience at Colony Restaurant on 21 May 2016. We were there to celebrate my niece Natasha’s Birthday. I brought my brother and his family there to celebrate his daughter Natasha’s birthday that day. We booked a table there for lunch. My family were so impressed by Colony's server LEE LEE. She made Natasha feel very special. LEE LEE prepared a super-delicious birthday cake for me; it was the same mango mousse cake that she had prepared for me in March 2016 (for my birthday) and it was such a generous 1 kg cake. We all loved it, it was the most delicious cake we had ever tasted. That day was a Saturday and Colony Restaurant was so crowded. But LEE LEE went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. The other servers attending to our table were so busy with other guests but LEE LEE was so attentive that we hardly noticed that the other servers had not refilled our water and/or our tea. She is so quiet but forever watching to see if we need anything at all. She is quick and happy to serve and make us comfortable. My clients/guests told me that they were so honoured to be my guests that day because of the special treatment that LEE LEE gave us and the food that she prepared for us. It was a memorable birthday for my niece. Colony will always be my FAVOURITE restaurant of all time. LEE LEE IS A VERY SPECIAL PERSON AND I COMMEND RITZ CARLTON FOR HAVING STAFF LIKE HER. KUDOS TO RITZ CARLTON

We were looking forward to the opening of this renovated buffet restaurant. A new concept buffet restaurant is always a big welcome!!! The cold cut/seafood counters have the freshest items with many choices of sauces. I love the live stations-noodles - try the laksa, Indian,satay,chicken rice, etc. The hot food are just placed in front of these live stations so while waiting for our orders, we can then select other food items. The salads are on nice round table near this corner of the restaurant. The fruit juices n fruits have their own special corner too. Remember to spare your tummy for some great Desserts...you won't want to miss it! Definitely a 5/5. If you are looking for pastry takeaways, there is a bakery nearby, they have nice biscuit tins :
5
For seafood and sashimi lovers, you will enjoy the spread here! Nice ambience, great service and wonderful selection of food!Yes it pricey but you will leave the place smiling with a satisfied tummy!A great place for special occasion
5
Went here for a Saturday Buffet which proved to have a good selection of foods as both appetizers and main courses....BUT the sweets selection was unbelievable....only twice a year if you are on a diet or just trying to maintain weight...
4
The food selections were good and fresh. The ambience was excellent. The service was prompt and attentive. Very good for family get together
4
Frankly, i wasnt impressed by the cooked food section (normal - not as authentic) but the sashimi, seafood (crabs prawns) wowed me. It's the 1st buffet where chefs generously give uni (my fav).
5
It was a wonderful dining at Colony. There were a lot of variety of food at the buffet counters. The restaurant setup was classic. Great services from the team. Do visit Colony for more wonderful experience
3
Sadly, this used to be our family's fav buffet place. The standard has dropped quite a bit after the renovation. Still plenty of food choices but no longer as tasty
5
We had dinner at Colony and the experience was fantastic. The food was excellent and service was very attentive. We tried the Long Journey cocktail and it was one of the best cocktails we had ever tasted. The only disappointing station is the cheese one with very cheap cheese. Apart from that, we had an excellent moment at this restaurant
5
We went there after not having time to eat for the whole day. And did not regret! Best buffet i have ever seen. Especially seafood corner. Everything so delicious. The best buffet I have seen.
5
The staff serving our table at lunch is Nazar. He's very pleasant, friendly, attentive, excellent service with a smile especially for someone who has been on the internship for 1 month. It just takes so little to make someone's day. All the best to him !
5
Our family had a good experience on dining in Colony, super value !!Quality of food were good, and price is super reasonable !
5
Whilst staying at the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore my wife and I visited Colony a couple of times.A simply immense selection of every type of type Asian or Western cuisine you could wish for, no skimping on quality ingredients and products here. The seafood alone is worth the cost of the buffet, and such a helpful attitude, if you don't see something, they'll make it for you.Absolutely great, a real must for any food lover, all set in an elegant surrounding, this place is really fantastic, I thoroughly recommend it
5
WE had 4 days in a raw breakfast here and it was great even it was very busy. All Staff greeted us with a smile and the food was replaced fast and never looked messy. keep the great work up
5
Had dinner at Colony. Nice cosy ambience and great service staff. The food was very high standard - a great selection of local favourites like Laksa, Chicken Rice and Wanton Noodles; and international selection (sashimi, dim sum, seafood etc) . What stood out was the north Indian food - excellent quality, also the breads, roasts, truffle mash potatoes and the amazing Charcuterie section.Also tried the cocktail. great mobile cart with all the classic bartender tools - and you get to make the cocktail yourself too! fun!. Overall, a pleasant experience
5
Took my mum out to Colony to celebrate her belated birthday (which I mentioned while making the reservation on Chope), the buffet spread was substantial and service staff were very attentive. However, we did notice the service level decreasing as time went on...towards the end it was difficult to even signal a waiter for more water. Nonetheless, it was a good dining experience made better by the fact that the staff actually brought out a small cake and sang a birthday song for my mum! Many thanks to the team at Colony for putting so much thought into it
4
My second visit! Great layout , Good food, ambience and services! COLONY will be my top list of place for buffet.
5
At both our lunch and breakfast visits which were a few months apart, the wide smiles of delight that I saw on other customers' faces mirrored my own. Some people gasped in wonder as they came upon display after display of beautifully laid out food. This place has a varied and delicious buffet with local, Asian and Western dishes, and a nice choice of sweets. The seating area is intimate and luxurious. One of the best buffet experiences in town
5
Saw this was #3 in Singapore and wondered how a buffet could possibly be that good and it was sooo yum! We had dinner reservations but decided to go to lunch instead and it was amazing! Plethora of fresh sashimi and sushi. Ramens, laksa, Chinese, Indian, salads, pastas, desserts, and much more! Definitely give this place a try! Sage helped us out and gave us great advice for visiting Singapore. Thanks!
4
This was a pretty amazing buffet, if you like that sort of thing. As far as the quality of the food is concerned, everything from the sushi to the Singapore crab was very good. The wine list was not bad either.
5
Excellent buffet, one of the best meals I have had. Variety of food choices is great. Loved the seafood corner with unlimited sashimi and oyster. Dessert is delicious.
Good ambiance and the atmosphere is great.
Good service and beverage choices as well.
5
The ambience was really nice and the service staff were the best! Very attentive and polite. The food was well organised and selection was wide. Enjoyed myself thoroughly and will definitely visit again
5
Farewell dinner on a suday with my 3 brothers from different mothers and we had an extremely memorable evening. The buffet range was not the biggest i've ever had but the quality and thought that went into preparing the food was exceptional. The renowned laska was bursting with flavour with ever mouth, and could easily give Katong Laksa a run for their money.Great selection of seafood and cuts of meats. I tried their pasta live station and almost couldn't stop eating the fantastic Aglio Olio (reminding myself to go for variety) The dessert section was exemplary...crepe, Chocolate lava cakes, and an entire section of cakes to ensure your sweet tooth satiated. I personally gorged myself on the haagen dazs ice cream having 6 scoops (different flavours of course ) Would recommend for the dim sum section to be looked into to match quality and variety of the other sections. The staff were very helpful and friendly, occasionally popping by to see how things were going and ensuring we were taken cared of. Would recommend everyone to come and try this buffet :) Brace yourself....We were mind blow
5
Went for the champagne brunch package for my friends birthday. There was a table of 19 of us (20 odd year olds). The variety of food was pleasing, and most of it tasted quite good! What made the brunch however, was the incredible service of the waitress, Adilla. She was incredibly patient, kind, accommodating and understanding. Thank you very much Adilla for your incredible service, you made our day that much better. Would come back if I was guaranteed to have her again
5
Promptly attended to upon stepping into restaurant. Service was friendly and unassuming. Ambience was cozy and was given a sofa seating.Food selection was wide ranging from salad greens to fresh seafood to sashimi with local delicacies including Indian, Chinese and Grill fares. Freshly squeezed juices and appetising desserts were made to order. Highly recommended for buffet dining
5
This is my third visit to Colony this year. The last 2 times was with family and this time was with friends. I was worried that my impression may drop if the visit is too close. Somehow, the experience was still as fantastic. My wife and I was pleasantly surprised too be greeted by Ken at the later part of our dinner and his warmth and hospitality was felt immediately. Certainly, his presence made our experience even better as he is really friendly and professional. A great way to end the busy week with nice food and great company. Will definitely be back again
5
We've been coming to this restaurant for the friday night seafood buffet for over 5 years, even when Colony was the Greenhouse, and it's never disappointed.Service is always brisk, prompt and polite. Ambience is wonderful too.The variety of food available is huge. Since there is no way I can eat everything, i tend to avoid certain items which I feel will not be as good as what I can get elsewhere - namely the dimsum items, the pasta station and the chopped roast meats. The sashimi, oysters and seafood-on-ice are all very good, sweet and fresh. The grilled lobsters are a firm favourite, meat is sweet, succulent and not overcooked. Other enjoyable items are the beef satay, roast beef, the accompaniments to the roast beef ( mash potato, grilled veg ), lobster bisque, the chinese herbal soup, briyani, dhal, and mutton curry. The variety of bread is astounding, but the best is their baguette - thin, crispy crust with soft chewy interior; delicious paired with the french butter provided.Desserts are awesome too, with many cakes and puddings available. Our favourites though are the crepe suzette and house-made ice creams and sorbets. There are also a range of juices available.At S$88 for adults and a 15% credit card discount, definitely worth it!They say there is a smart casual dress code, but I see women and men there in shorts and slippers
4
Great selection and choices in a very nice ambient.Laksa is good. Service is good too. The staff there is friendly and approachable. It was a good deal with credit card discount. Will definitely like to go back there for another meal
5
We went there to celebrate my baby girl's birthday, the food and service as well as the ambiance were fantastic. One of the staff, Ms Sage, heard we were celebrating birthday there, she even made a small cake for my daughter and sang birthday song for us. The other waitress from Korea also provide her kindly service to us. Overall,we had a lot of fun there and the restaurant was highly recommended by my family. We will visit there again soon. : 
5
Just visiting this restaurant absolutely fabulous place. Buffett style restaurant with style. On par with brunch at Sandy Lane in Barbados. Food fantastic, staff very helpful and friendly. A must for anyone who likes very nice food.
5
This was my second visit. This restaurant never fails to impress me with the level of service and food quality. Will definitely return.
3
Huge variety. However, I felt that the food that tasted best were the cheaper type of foods like, BBQ pork buns, custard buns, crepes, their butter was very good, the supposedly more expensive foods like seafood on ice taste bland, especially the crab legs. Hot foods were decent but nothing to shout about. Would recommend to go only if you like big variety of food. Service was decent but not fantastic
5
I've always thought the seafood at the Ritz Carlton in Singapore was among the best, and the evening seafood buffet was no exception. I would go on Friday or Saturday when it includes live lobster. The buffet is less expensive than the Sunday champagne brunch but no less elegant in the renovated Colony restaurant. (I've indicated below that its prices are high, but that's because of the type of place it is; it's definitely a deal.) Also, the staff were really attentive and professional, which is ultimately what makes it a 5-star experience. The manager, Retish, and a waitress, Monica, were really exceptional even by Ritz standards. I would look for them when you're there
5
On our last night in Singapore, we went to the buffet at the Colony, located inside the Ritz Carlton! The buffet is excellent with fresh seafood, all kinds of hot dishes, soups, pastry, etc. The service is also excellent! We especially enjoy the oysters, shrimps, Alaskan king crab legs! Will definitely come back next time
3
Our 1st visit to Colony after the renovation.....My colleague got in first & her first reaction was 'Wow!'. The friendly staff has brought her for a dining tour since she was early. And I think was really a warm welcome :)When I stepped in, yes I love the design, ambience is romantic & cosy. 5 of us were seated at this semi-round couches & chairs - very comfortable. Whole design concept is nice to dine in...but the lighting can be a little brighter.I had a tour myself... from the 'cold to the warm station'. Under seafood on ice...there are 3 types oysters (NZ, France & Ireland). Freshly open on the spot.Though NZ oyster is not the best but the other 2 types are way too salty to go for 2nd pc & meaty is miserable. I am anticipating to have USA or Canada oyster to be in the menu. Hope the restaurant can include in the buffet. I will sure go back.Next, 'must try' alaska king crab leg... very succulent, meat is firm with natural sweetness. Very satisfying. Come in quite a jumbo size filled with solid meat & so easy to take out - especially for lazy people..no excuse to say 'NO'.At sushi station, the sashimi does not look fresh & appealing so i did not go for it.Roast duck I heard was quite juicy & tender. Chilli crab looks good & the sauce tastes as good but not the meat - kinda disappointed :(The dessert corner has a variety but not presentation & taste not as good. During 'Green House' time, the dessert spread looks more exquisite, beautiful, delicate, prime with quality. Just too good to resist...Verdict: Price does not match the food quality.P.S. I will go back if there is a change in the menu list & anticipate for better qualitySign-offFood love
5
This is definitely the best Hotel Buffet dinner my wife and I have ever had. It's a night to celebrate my wife birthday and we are both a seafood goer. We can never resist a Seafood feast, and the Lobster here is ocean fresh and best of all - FREE FLOW. Wahhh....The Oyster is another worth talking about, they are so fresh that you can taste the clear Oyster liquor right in your mouth...Yummy...Hahaha.. Now come my favorite chili-crab, they serve big, fat meaty crab and lover like me can never have enough. Overall, the food quality is flawless, the spread is wide and you may find cuisine of most popular culture and places, from Japanese, Indian, Chinese to western.The service staff is friendly and attentive. Special mention go to Chef Kelly, Chef Sky and Mr. Rethish. They are just marvelous. Knowing that we are here to celebrate my wife birthday, the restaurant had prepared us a BIG surprise. We were presented with a little uniquely crafted, nice rounded chocolate cake by the pastry chef (too bad, didn't get a chance to look closely at her name tag, was overly elated when the team walk towards us, I would love to thank her with this opportunity) and a birthday song with the companies of Mr. Rethish and his team..... Well Done! The best gift I could have given to my wife....The ambience, the service team, the sincerity, the food spread and the food quality.... THUMB UP.We will be back, for sur
5
I really enjoyed dining at Colony for special occasions. Pleasant environment and kind staffs. Staff named Harvey took good care of my two year old son and our family had real good time at Colony
5
This is my 2nd visit to the Colony with friends. I am very impressed with the quality of food and high standard of service in this restaurant. Both times that I was there, it was to celebrate a friend's birthday. The food was excellent the ambience was perfect! We especially love the chilli crab and a few of us went for at least 2 servings. The had a good spread food and there is a mix of Asian and Western food. The service staff was very attentive and after finding out that it was my friend's birthday on that day, they gave her a slice of complementary cake. This place is definitely one of the best buffet in Singapore
3
my family and I went for an afternoon tea, and were mildly dissapointed at the limited selection, primarily desserts. The savoury food was only brought out to us about 30 minutes after seated and there was no vegetarian options and only one pescetarian option. However, the food nonetheless was nice and service was very good
4
Trendy, casual buffet restaurant which serves good buffet spread of fresh, quality food. Good service and stylish, trendy ambience.
5
The spread here is incredible. Chinese, Japanese, Indian, western. Every dish was a hit. And I'm afraid i had many. The Singapore Chili crab here is now my favorite. The Laksa is unique and incredibly tasty. Chicken Rice.. lovely. Leave space for dessert - the mango cake, teh tarik and cendol are AMAZING. But what tops it all for my hubby and me tonight, is that incredible Ritz Carlton service, exceeding our expectations tenfold. Every member of the staff was there to ensure you're enjoying your evening, they couldn't do enough for us. From our attentive waitress Vivian (offered us a crab cracker the moment she saw I had crabs on my plate, then minutes later came back with a finger bowl!), Raj (Rethish) who was so cheerful and had a lovely sense of humour, Chef Joseph was so happy to put together my chicken rice and dim sum, and even offered to carry it to my table for me. Last of all, I have to mention Chef Alvin - I saw some Yoo Char Koey by the Rojak section, and had a hankering for Yoo Char Koey and a little Kaya (coconut jam) dip - the section he worked in had been packed up and cleared, but he took the trouble to go into the kitchen and bake me a fresh piece of Char Koey, and went to look for some Kaya to go with it too. Kudos to Ms Gene Del Barrio and her wonderful team. This restaurant deserves to be number one in all of Singapore, in my book
4
So good we were there 3 times for their buffet. Good value too. Took a point off cos seafood section could be better - bit bland when everything is boiled/steamed/ a la naturel.Good value for the variety compared to other buffets.Lovely comfortable restaurant, service can be hit and miss at times, but wait staff are attentive when called.5 different sections - seafood, Asian, Japanese, Indian, Western.Dessert - yummilicious - wanted to try everything but couldn't eat anymore
5
Online booking can be done via their website. Had special requested for one slice of birthday cake for bf bday. It's a complimentary 200g of chocolate cake. The seats are not too close to each other. Definitely hv privacy. Wide spread of food. First time I see buffet serving four different types of oyster. And the crab is huge too!!! And do not miss the dessert corner! Love their creme brulee. Fresh fruit juices are available too. Staffs are all attentive, esp Quang. He is sincere and diligent. We are impressed at the service!!! We definitely will come bc again. One of the best buffet I ever had
5
They have the wide variety of food, i love the chilli crab, the oyster bar from different countries, the Sashimi, sushi , the pasta, they have chicken rice, roasted duck & pork, satay, roasted beef, vegetarian food, Indian food, french cuisine & I will give the thumb's up for the dessert table. they have more cakes, local sweet treats, more fruits... they also have good range of cheese, slice hams & pickles...the ambiance & service is very good....
5
Great ambience and good food! Love the fresh juice bar. The food spread was good too especially the lobster
5
Went to Colony for the first time since its been revamped with my wife, our daughters and their boyfriends. Food was out of this world, great sushi and sashimi and frankly something for everyone - complimented perfectly with the vintage champagne. Definitely be going back there soon
4
Buffet we dined in Ritz-Carlton, Restaurant Colony, after arrived the hotel just turn left, then you can see this beautiful dessert bar, all the section is open kitchen, including sea food(oyster from three country), cheese, salad, sushi, ham, a lots of hot food(chicken rice, spaghetti, beef pork etc..)Dinner $78+, the value is more then price so maybe we will come back to visit again
4
I'm a serioue buffet buff, so mention 'The Line', 'Melt', and 'Edge', I will definitely be familiar with these names. 'Colony', on the other hand, has gone through some major revamp, and I was amazed at the spread of cuisine that they had. Ranging from the usual Japanese fare to even local delights such as Hainanese Chicken, I was amazed that this buffet had fresh juice as well!Aside from the food, the ambience is only indeed extremely condusive for a wide variety of date types - couple's night out, girls' night out, birthday celebrations, you name it, we can have it there. The booth seats provide ultimate privacy and cosiness, while the large long tables give big groups a chance to gather without anyone being left out.Oh! But singles who are on their first date, should avoid this place if they do not want to appear like a glutton in front of their perspective partner. After all, when such a large array of food is presented in front of us, who has the willpower to refuse? Not to mention, the cake topping would be the impeccable service that Colony staff members provide. Sensitive to your needs, they take initiative in noticing personal preferences and act upon them, providing a fine balance between attentiveness & intrusiveness.All in all, I'm glad that I had an enjoyable time at Colony. It would be even better if they had credit card loyalty discounts though, as the price can be a deterrence to those who want an excellent dining experience, without having to break their banks. Thank you Colony, for a memorable experience! I do hope that you continue improvising and maintaining your standards, to keep customers coming! Also, let's not forget occasional promotions that will definitely help to entice us further! *winks

The food selection was a lot. Most importantly, they are tasty. As my wife like to try many different food, it was a great treat for her.They allow for me to order from their ala-carte menu, in this case, Laksa, which i love it when i ordered the same in through their room service in May 2016. This is unlike many food establishment where they were afraid of the person ordering ala-carte eating from the person which is on the buffet menu. As a customer, I felt trusted by the food establishment and all the more I will not abuse their trust in me. Thumbs up for Ritz Carlton

Everything was close to perfect. Service staff was attentive and smiley! Food was delicious as usual. Wish that there was more variety in the food selection though but all else, perfect!

If you don't mind a buffet (I geernally do not partake), then this certainly is a great spread. A super spread of salads and cold cuts and sashimi etc, and a very large section with live cooking stations. A little pricey, but worth it if you have the time to enjoy.The decor is too busy to my liking; things happening everywhere. I prefer a more quiet approach
5
Went there for the lunch buffet with my wife to celebrate my birthday. First thought was that the ambience was fantastic. Whether you're there in a big group or just two persons, they have just the right table setting for you. My wife was pregnant and close to delivery and we were cautious about cooked and uncooked food. But she really wanted to have her cold seafood, so we asked the staff to help us re-boil the crabs and prawns which we picked and they gladly obliged. Overall a very good experience for me and I will definitely be back again

Came here for Sunday Champagne Brunch. Let's talk about service first. Service was attentive, professional and courteous. On occssions a bit too efficient in clearing plates (before we were done). Noted a few staff engaging proactively with guests. But we were left alone generally which worked for us. They topped up drinks attentively.Found the decor very interesting and visually pleasing. Worth a walk around the almost maze-like layout.Food was generally of good quality. Heard many rave reviews about the chicken rice and laksa. They were very good but we have tasted better. Guess it is a matter of preference. But there is good variety to satisfy your cravings. Dessert selection was good and to our taste. Overall a pleasant experience but there is a missing x factor which prevents me from saying this would be a place I would regularly visit.
5
This is one of my family's favourites. There is a good selection of local and western food, plus a well executed dessert section including chocolate truffles! Must haves include the lamb chops and lobster ball laksa. Also included is fruit juices, freshly pressed as per customer request from any of the fruits available that day
5
My wife and I went to Colony for dinner buffet. First impression of the decor and ambience was amazing. Love the feel of dining in British type colonial interior! Staff were amazing and polite right from stepping into hotel and while dining there. The servers were attentive and polite, and they would clear the plates every now and then. The foods were simply fabulous and we were spoilt for choices. The foods which I personally thought were fresh, especially I was attracted to their Ice Bar which featured fresh & succulent oysters. And I had their famous chicken rice which the rice was very aromatic and every grain of it was fill with chicken stock, and the chilli sauce was on point. The grilled lobster with melted cheese was also definitely delicious. Price was reasonable for that buffet spread and quality. Overall, my wife and I were happy and satisfied with the dining experience

Love the customer service and ambience of the food however the snow crab at the seafood counter was not replenish however couldn't have 2nd helping

This is a new set up at Ritz, previously was Greenhouse. The atmosphere is more private and allows one to walk 'more' to get your food ranging from seafood, sushi, sashimi, Chinese, Indian. It also serves pasta, cold cuts, cheese and local dishes. The seafood with king crabs is good and I actually fell in love with 3 items here. 1st : laska and it's the best I tried amongst hotels and you must eat it as the gravy is 'shiokalingam'. 2nd; rojak is good too. 3rd a baguette with its butter, simple yet heavenly. My friend mentioned it's ondeh-ondeh is good but I have no luck in putting it in my mouth. For the price of S$58 before taxes is really a good place to lunch in. Dinner on weekdays is S$78 and weekends is S$88
5
My hubby and I decided for an impromptu dinner on a weekday. Did a walk in and was told that it's fully booked as there was some coporate booking. Instead of turning us down flatly, the staff took the initiative to ask for our no. and if we mind waiting another 10mins. We walked to the nearby lobby sofa to wait. About 10 mins, the staff walked all the way to the lobby personally to invite us in. Wow! After a sumptuous dinner, we called for the bill and Sally attended to us. She is one of the best service staff we had ever met. Despite being so busy processing the bills of so many tables, she still took the trouble to attend to our other random requests. Thumbs up to her
5
We went there because we were staying at the hotel and were pleasantly surprised that even though it was a buffet, the food was really good, and there was a huge choice.
5
Dined here while staying at the Ritz for 6 days. Even if not staying at the Ritz, this should be a destination for an outstanding dining experience. Everything - from the food, presentation, service, - was flawless.
5
This has been the best Hotel Buffet dinner I have ever had so far in Singapore! The service ... The Food ... It's totally amazing! I would like to compliment all the staff at Colony especially a Big Shout Out to Ms. Adilla for being an Awesome Trainee! She always serve us with a smile and the passion to get to know her diners well! To the supervisor Mr. Rethish also! He really goes the extra miles for us even with the smallest request! I will definately bring my Clients to dine here!Will write a review on my blog too traveleverywhereluxury !! Can't wait to be back! (Need to lose 2kg now first)

Chef Goh Kok Vee:He offers Best Service Quality & is the Most Gracious Chef.Chef Sin Yi Jie:He offers Ultimate Dining Experience & is Super Friendly
5
We have a really wonderful time at Colony this evening. Besides the usual good food we have come to expect in this restaurant, we really appreciate the excellent service rendered by the staff. Want to especially commend Supervisor Phua Siew Yi for her excellent service. She really goes the extra mile to meet our expectations of what good customer service should be. Also a big Thank You to Manager Lewis Quinn for preparing a beautiful birthday cake for the occasion.
5
The ambience is great! Food is superb! Waitresses and waiters are all very friendly and helpful. Harvey attended to my husband and I. He patiently attended to our queries. And his mega-watt smile made our day!

Booked the dinner buffet to celebrate my lil' sister's birthday and it was such a enjoyable experience for the both of us. Special thanks to 3 outstanding staff namely Ken , Hycinth (not sure if that's how her name was spelled), and also a korean lady on duty (we didn't manage to get her name) that escorted us to our table when we arrived.It's that personal touch that made our time there really great. From the moment we arrived it was all smiles and it made us feel welcomed. then the complimentary champagne to the slice of birthday cake and the occasional greetings and what can they do to make sure we were comfortable, it certainly exceeded our expectations. The food was great and there was a wide spread to choose from , the raspberry drink (*must-try) that the staff recommended to us from the drinks bar was very refreshing and unique. What can be improved was the lighting, it was a little dim and dark during dinner service , probably to suit the ambience but it could be a little brighter. Thumbs up to all the staffs there and we definitely will be back again !

let's start by the positive: 1- People : the service team is awesome, lovely and really deserve a big congrats. Special prize for Amber and her friendly and efficient service.2- presentation of the dishes is well maintained and the place has some refined deco that makes it a pleasant placethe negatives now: The taste of the food. what a pity and deception, from the seafood buffet (despite several type of oysters, shrimps water-flavoured), passing through the Meat, up to the cheese bar where many ones were not that fresh. No worries on the cleaness, nobody was sick, but it is more a lack of flavours in the products, guys you need to challenge your procurement team, as for a reputable brand like Ritz, the only ones saving the situation were the Indian and Asian food. i will not mentionned the champagne because it is more a taste due to the brand itself (moet & chandon) , and this is really pure subjective topic, so no blame on this.really not worthy paying 400 SGD + for a couple, where so many alternatives availables for an awesome sunday champagne brunch in singapore.i tried it but i will definitely not come back for the sunday brunch. It is my own experience only, but at the end i really do not enjoy it.Hopefully some of you will have a better one

We were served by Sage and Alex on 23 June. Their service were excellent. Sage is really friendly and helpful. She's also very attentive and thoughtful.
3
First time trying since the change from the Greenhouse.A let down the space is now dark and crowded.Choice of food is a lot less than before.Good if you are drinking alcohol.Service is ok not outstanding as you would expect given the location and pricing
2
came here for my birthday, had great selection of food and choices but not the best buffet i had tasted thus far. staff were friendly and accommodating nonetheless.
4
Great spread, fresh and good food for a reasonable price! Service staff was friendly and helped cleared plates promptly
5
We held our wedding dinner reception at Colony and received great assistance from the service team at the restaurant. The chefs at each counter were also very friendly.The food selection is vast and there was something for everyone in my wedding party. The quality of the food served was high, although we noticed that there are slight inconsistencies (in terms of size of shellfish, for example) when compared to our previous experience at Colony, but this is as expected of fresh produce. Everyone enjoyed the buffet and it was a great experience dining there.No major complaints. We were slightly puzzled at the timing that the king crab was served (fairly late into the dinner).We will be back again on a different day to try the other specialities.Kudos to Gene, Harvey and Siew Yi for a job well done for my reception
5
Went with my family to Colony to celebrate my wife's birthday and it did not disappoint.The staff were very courteous and child-friendly (our son's baby seat was the nicest we've seen in a restaurant).The food choices were diverse and really well executed (the sushi, chicken satay, cheeses and desserts stood out to me).Would definitely come back for future occasions.Super thanks to Adilla for being so gracious to us!
2
I like to go for buffets but I tasted not really fresh seafood in this buffet. Surprisingly, I prefer the options and the selection that The Line offers (at Shangri- La Hotel) They do have nice laksa counter that serves good laksa. Look forward to going back and hopefully have a better experience
5
I LIKE THE AMBIENCE AND SETTING OF THE COLONY. The buffet dinner was well spread, with a wide variety of both Asian and Western food to choose from. I particularly liked the different species of fresh rock oysters, large prawns, scallops and both the Alaskan and chilli crabs.We were well served by the waiters and waitresses. We like the cheerful and courteous Manager called Raj who had a good sense of humor
5
My spouse and I celebrated my birthday at Colony. Food selection was good and the staff were attentive and friendly.We would like to specially compliment Mr Lim Beng Kuan, our server on that day. He has a passion serving and even offered to take pictures for his customers. He is full of zest and energy. We had an excellent experience dining at colony. He is indeed a jewel.Well done
5
After the renovation and renaming, the atmosphere and feel is a lot more classy and soothing.Food wise, there are simply nothing to complaint but have full of praises, especially the Alaska crab claws which are very fresh and there's no extreme saltiness which you tend to get it elsewhere. Seafood are very fresh and loved their fresh oysters!There's also a fresh fruit juice counter which we really enjoyed the refreshing concoction juices! Will go there again, soon
5
My family often have a dinner at Colony because all food served is very tasty and fresh and I like the classy dining area. But the most important thing why we choose colony all the time is their number one service. I particulary want to mention the service of Dana, Grace and Ellia. They were so thoughtful and careful so that I could enjoy the dinner time even if I brought a baby alone. Thank you so much. When I also celebrated my birthday at colony, I was deeply moved by their lovely conglatulation song for me. If someone ask me to recommend any restaurant in SG, I would recommend Colony without any hesitaition. Oh I almost forgot to say this, desert section is so amazing. you should try some
5
Thank you for a great night celebrating my wife's birthday. I particularly want to highlight the service of Cory and Adilla from the restaurant. Cory was our greeter and welcomed us warmly and helped us to find to get a table after a cancelation from being fully booked. She was polite, courteous and very professional as I would expect from a Ritz Carlton employee. Adilla was our server and I bet there isnt a server at the colony with a bigger smile and joy. I commended her on her prompt service and kind demeanor. She really did a great job, and I'm thankful she made my wife's birthday so special. We sat here a long time, so she definitely put forth effort! Thanks Cory and Adilla for making our celebration so pleasant and enjoyable. We will definitely be back!Side note: food was exceptional, so that also needs to be highlighted!
5
Spread and good quality was good. We appreciate there is a fruit juice bar and the cuts were well done.
5
The food was really good and the sevice was great , we thought that it was a great place to eat with friends and family. I love it very much❤️
5
We chose Colony to celebrate my birthday last weekend. We enjoyed it very much.The dining area is very nice and there are many options as you would expect. I enjoyed the seafood area, there were always freshly shucked oysters and the Asia food area was my favorite. All food was good quality as you expected and I will return to try it again.Also, I'd like to say thank you to the staff call "Sage", she has provided a very good service, she is friendly and sociable person, in our conversation we got to know each other and know she is from Taiwan. When we know she is a student and this is her intern job, it was really surprised us, as she did really good job in her service. Once again, thank you for the good service and awesome buffet

Loved the whole classy setting. For a Friday night, the place was quite crowded. Not surprising, given that there is a really wide selection of food available. Plenty of seafood to go around. Loved the baked lobster and grilled prawns, roasted meat section and wide variety of desert. Only complain is that given the price of the buffet, I think the restaurant could be a little more generous on the tea serving. We asked for green tea and was given 1 pot to share and when we asked for refill, the waitress only refilled with hot water instead of giving us a new pot. Mind you, this is a tea bag, how many rounds of hot water can it be refilled?Also noted that the noodles and pasta portion was quite small. Perhaps that's the intention so that the guests could eat a wider variety. But for the kids who are more confined in their selection, will end up asking for double portions.Nevertheless, still a very enjoyable buffet dinner. One of the better ones I have had. Absolutely loved the desert selection
4
I have eaten at the buffet restaurant of every 5 star hotel in Singapore over the years. Colony restaurant serves the best buffet that I have eaten. Both quality and variety are good. Service is also good.However, I don't like the coffee here. It is not even as good as what I can get at McCafe. It tastes like something out of a cheap machine. I wish the manager can go and visit some of my favourite coffee shops like Nylon, Atlas, Ronin, Dutch Colony, etc and find out what is really good coffee. A restaurant like Colony should be able to invest in a good machine and get a good barista
5
I came here for lunch and the food was great. Iwould like to commend the staff, Hong, for providing us with examplary service. She is very detail oriented and provided us with a service that wasnt too overbearing. Her service really made a difference to my dining experience and I will definitely come back again
4
Ate here on a Sunday evening and enjoyed it.The dining area is very nice and there are many options as you would expect. I enjoyed the seafood, cold bar and cheeses.The Indian food section was ok but the food was cold so that could improve.All food was good quality as you expect from Ritz hotel and I will return to try it again.Service was excellent and servers were attentive to refill drinks etc
4
Yes indeed!I thoroughly enjoyed the buffet experience at Ritz Carlton's Colony.From the food spread to the ambience to the service, it was all about quality.If you wish to partake in a gastronomical escapade complete with glorious food, tip top crew service and a stunning ambience, this would be it
5
Freshest seafood spread. Oysters freshly shucked. a choice of sashimi and sushi too. Salads - they even offer the local rojak! As for local delights - the lobster ball laksa and satay totally hit the spot for me. There's also a wide variety of indian delights - briyani, rogan josh, naan, tandoori chicken. There's also a roast of the day, a pasta station - and a juice station (free flow). And the desserts are also to-die-for! Many different varieties of cakes (they offered carrot cake, chocolate mousse cake, green tea cheese cake, raspberry cake the day I was there) as well as a good varietyof local nonya kuihs, and a crepe suzette station - freshl made!! |There's also waffles, ice cream, chocolate truffles, and a variety of cheesesI must say they offer one of the widest spreads for buffets here
5
My staff and I went to the Colony for buffet dinner. The service is excellent and staff is friendly. The ambience is nice and there are a lot of choices for food. I love the dessert, everything taste good from crepes to strawberry ice cream.Will bring my family there next time
5
Nice ambience. Spoilt for choice with the wonderful selection of foods. Definitely one of the best buffet restaurants. Service standards were exemplary. From local fare to japanese to western, you will be able to find something to your liking.
5
This place is a must go to ! You can have your own ramen made, pasta , crepes. Such beautiful food everything tasted wonderful
5
Wonderful selection of food for all tastes. The best fresh seafood, choice cuts of meat and a great selection for vegetarians. The layout allows for dinners to move around the area and select food while enjoying the ambience and beautiful decor. The staff made the evening, best service and they are so proud to be part of this restaurant
5
We had our office dinner here and the ambience of the place is superb for client or corporate small meet up, family and even intimate get togethers. The menu is extensive. Buffet is excellent and service is top class. Of course you pay for good service and good food so its a bit expensive but worth the price
5
I've been to many hotel buffets and I find that Colony is one of the best out there. There is a wide range of food from local to western cuisine. Their cold bar is great, there's like French and Irish oysters. Even though the demand for oysters were high, there were always freshly shucked oysters. The roast beef and rack of lamb were great. Pretty amazed that the staff were very quickly and efficiently. There was always food on display even with the crowd and the plates were always cleared quickly. Best of all the staff were very friendly and attentive to the needs of customers.
5
It is really a great place for my family meeting. I'm truly impressed not only by all the delicacies but the nice servant,Harvey, who is gentle, well-trained,and considerate! I'll definitely recommend my friend to come here and enjoy!

Really not sure why this is rated 3rd best in Singapore. We were staying at the Pan Pacific and needed to be in bed early so booked a table based on reviews here. When we arrived we were seated but nobody explained how things worked or how to place a drinks order. Unfortunately our waitress did not understand English so she brought somebody else over to explain things. Staff kept clearing plates without offering to top up/bring new drinks which we found irritating.The sea food is not good quality (which we found everywhere in Singapore) but the rest of the food we had was good, and the chefs were friendly and had good knowledge. It's quite expensive for a buffet (78SGD before tax) and also includes a service charge (for a buffet??!!). We complained about the poor service and were given a good discount - the assistant manager (Gene) dealt with our complaint very well which was the saving grace. It seemed from what we could hear that many other tables were not happy with their bills either.Perhaps we are just not used to a buffet but we have eaten much better food and would still have expected better service
5
We were invited to this restaurant by our wonderful friends for a belated wedding anniversary dinner. The staff are very attentive on our arrival, we were seated and immediately were given drinks while we waited for our friends. Dinner was amazing with plenty of choice in the buffet. It was like tasting dishes from all over the world. The chef who was at the pasta section, cooked your choice in front of you and chatted to guests as he cooked their meal. Mine was so good. Everything here was 1st Class. Service was perfect. All staff polite and attentive. Will definitely go again. Thanks for the anniversary cake too. Melts in the mouth
5
It was our second time here and the experience proved that the first time was no fluke. This time we brought some overseas friends along. It was a Friday evening and the restaurant was practically full. The booth seats and table assigned to us was not ideal as our friends are a little on the big side, which meant getting in and out of the seats to make their way to the buffet spread was a little inconvenient. She must have sensed that we were uncomfortable because shortly after, team member Honey approached us and asked if we preferred a change of tables as one was recently made available. Needless to say, we jumped at the suggestion. I must commend Honey for being observant and taking initiative. Well done! The service rendered was nothing short of wonderful. We had to ask that the empty plates be cleared the first time, but thereafter it was done without hesitation. The spread was wide and grouped according to their food types, e.g. sushi, seafood, dessert, etc. The international spread was also distinguishable, so the Indian dishes, the Chinese dishes, etc.; were well separated.Chef Joseph did a marvelous job of cooking our pasta dishes. He did it with gusto, passion and enthusiasm. It was obvious he liked what he was doing. When we went for satay the second time, the tray was empty again due to popular demand. Chef Joseph noticed it and asked me to wait as he was getting some ready to be put into the tray. Another commendable team member was Elaine at the dessert counter. My partner was getting ice-cream when he casually remarked that he felt a tad bloated after the heavy mains. Elaine overhead the remark and suggested 2 scoops of sorbet as they were sour and could help alleviate the fullness. Great thinking and once again, initiative. Keep it up!Having experienced first class service for the second time, I would not count out coming here for a third or fourth time in the near future
5
The pastry team setting up the dessert table before the start of the 3-hour party. Big thanks to the excellent team at @ritzcarlton for the impeccable service, in every way possible! Special mention to the restaurant Manager Siew Yi, who's ever so attentive to our needs. On weekdays when I have rushed meetings with her during lunch hour, she would pack me lunch and make sure I don't go hungry; Quick turnaround whenever I had any queries wrt the event; Ensured that the dessert table was set up exactly the way I wanted it to be; Made sure that my guests were comfortable, for eg. Asked if I had any friends who were breastfeeding and she would take them to a lounge area within one of the restrooms where they could nurse their babies; Saved food for my husband and I as we had no time to eat till the party was over. We were so impressed with her excellent service and unanimously agreed to throw future parties at the Colony again
5
I love the new deco! And I think it is value for money for the buffet with chilli crab, Chinese roast station, cook-on-the-spot pasta station, a good selection of cold dishes, chesses, cold cuts, Indian, Chinese (Singapore Chilli crab), western (roast and crayfish with cheese)...a juice bar and a tim sum station. And the dessert is simply heavenly!! The variety of desserts is simply out of this world! Well I always leave room for dessert! Service is fantastic even though you have to ask the waiters to refill your tap water all the time
4
Was surprised that the staff refused to freshly shuck the oysters when requested to; selection of food quite smal
5
During a 12 day stay in Singapore, my wife and I ate 5 times in Colony, 4 times for breakfast and once for the Sunday Champagne brunch.Each time we were amazed, but the service, the ambiance and the quality and exceptional choices of foods on offer.Breakfast offers every imaginable choice from regular Western offerings, to Indian delights, Japanese delicacies and Asian dumplings & soups. Everything we samples was delicious.Returning for the Sunday brunch was another eye opener with so many offerings from the 8 live food stations. Sushi, bbq meats, western roasts, Indian curries, Asian delights, desserts galore and more cheeses than I could count.It's not wonder that Colony is now ranked 3 on Tripadvisor
4
In one word "Awesome!"So much variety.So much food.Good quality food.Make a reservation since it was quite well patronised even on a Sunday.There's lobster ball noodles (really it is like a fishball), duck and chicken rice, Northern Indian food and naan and papadam, leg of lamb and the usual suspects etc.Desserts - A wide variety of desserts, ice cream and I especially like the broken chocolate pieces (like La Maison's mendicant but only with nuts).Overall a good meal. Good service too
4
The atmosphere was great and comfortable!Lots of variety for different type of cuisine.Love the fruits and juice bar - healthy choice!It was a great place for dining and service was very attentive and hospitality
5
It was my first visit to the restaurant Colony since the transformation from Greenhouse. I was there with my husband to celebrate my birthday and we are glad to have made the choice to dine there. The ambiance was lovely, selection and quality of food was wonderful as well. Most importantly, I received very warm service from the staff there. Special mention to Wayne Khor, who delivered exceptional service. He was friendly and attentive and the service delivered was warm and personalized! It's a delight to meet someone who is so passionate in serving and I will definitely recommend Colony to my friends and family
5
we were at the Colony dinner buffet to celebrate my beloved wife's birthday.I must bring attention to the excellent service we experienced during our time there by all the service staff. They were all attentive and very polite and very patient. thank you all.Special thanks also to Phil, for looking after us.thank you Phil.shall surely return again
5
It was the 4th time we dine at Colony on 11June 2016. Personally, I have limited choice of food as dont take seafood so it's my husband who enjoys the spread. However, I love to return to the restuarant as I like their service very much. From the 1st visit till the recent visit, their services level is consistent. From the reservation call, till we make payment, it had be a good experience. When I was pregnant during the 2nd&3rd visit few months back, I was given special treatment to make sure I have a comfortable seat. There was alsi a birthday surprise for my husband during our 2nd visit. My 4year boy also enjoy it very much as the staffs were so friendly to children. It's definitely a place we will return
5
The food was great. The ambiance was very warm. The crew were very friendly and cordial. I definitely will recommend Colony at Ritz Carlton, to my friends
4
Had a great lunch with my family. Good food and atmosphere is nice. Staff are very friendly and provide good service. Would definitely visit the restaurant again
5
Staff will always check on you. Very caring with kids! Variety of food is quite wide, They serve very good lamb chop.
5
Outstanding experience. Food was great but the service was just top notch. Staff were all very friendly with special mentions to Firdaus that was attending to out table. Was celebrating my girlfriend's birthday but I didn't tell the staff about it. Somehow Firdaus overheard it and brought us a birthday cake as well as a small gift. These small gestures really helped make our night all the more enjoyable. Food was really good too, especially the lobster bisk and the oyster bar which I really enjoyed. Highly recommend colony to anyone looking for a good dinner
5
its our 7th year wedding anniversary, Me and my wife was browsing thru hotels to look for a perfect venue to celebrate our anniversary and we came across Ritz Carlton, at first I have doubts but when I started to check on their restaurant I found out Colony, it sparks a curiosity on me when they mention that the restaurant was catering for 8 Asian cuisine. To cut the story short we book a table at colony and on the night it self we were greeted to a really nice and friendly lady and she showed us our table. I was surprise on the venue, I know they have made some renovation but the way they have plan it, it was really brilliant. The food was really fantastic and really delicious. one of the staff by the name of Raj went to our table and greeted us with a warm smile and ask us how's our dinner? I know a lot of restaurant do that but the way he execute it, it was superb, there is a connection already.we had a quick chat and wow what can I say the service was really amazing. we are about to finished our meal when one of their staff a Indian guy went to our table with a cake he was accommodated by one of his colleague by the name of Hyacinth she greeted us and she and my wife made a connection with Bags she is really brilliant in looking thing to talk to and to start a conversation. we were also surprise that they have found out that its our wedding anniversary. To sum up every thing, It was amazing definitely we are going back to colony, Fantastic staff really amazing food, Fabulous venue
5
I went to Colony for a lunch this time. Service was impeccable as usual, especially to Ken and Rajtesh who was there to service us. We celebrated my good friend's birthday and a cake was presented with a candle. The freshness of the food are still great and I could not ask for more. I would love to visit Colony again in due time
5
I am bowed over by the friendly and attentive staff of the restaurant. Not only do they serve with sincerity, they go out of their way to enhance my meal with surprises upon learning of my birthday. Ken was especially kind in his services and the restaurant manager of the day took special care to make my stay a memorable one. It is a wonderful accompaniment to the good and fresh food they serve with pride and pretty presentation. Definitely a place with a personal touch and class.
5
This place is one of the best restaurants in Singapore (which is already quite a challenge). We had a wonderful celebration dinner last night and I am very happy we chose Buffet. It was a line-up of delicious choices from appetizers to desserts. Extremely attentive service, great wine recommendation, 2 glasses of fine champagne and birthday cake on the house, quiet and gentle ambience, smiling faces - what more can one wish for?Special thanks to Lim Beng and Bala for their perfect service!!Looking forward for the opportunity to come back
4
First visit to the Colony for a dinner buffet. The setting and ambience of the Colony is excellent. It is a beautiful resturant. The dinner buffet selection is extensive, catering for western and asian cusines. Some gems incude the house made pate, fresh oysters, sashimi, the roast duck, indian tandoori and the desert bar. For a dinner buffet it is highly recommended. All the food is fresh and pleasingly displayed. The service from the waiters and chefs is the best in Singapore
4
We love the luxurious ambience and the exceptional service from the staff. Food excellent quality and beautiful looking makes it worth. I would recommend Colony as an ideal spot for a sample of Singapore cuisine. We will be back for more
5
Went there for my anniversary dinner and their service was superb! The staffs would constantly check on you and upon finding out that we were there for our anniversary, they even surprised us with a cake! They have a scrumptious spread as well! Thank you Ken and your awesome team of staffs

I am not one who takes time to write reviews but I'm writing one (immediately after my dinner) because this thoroughly deserves one.I came to the Colony for my 1st anniversary dinner and we found the food spread great but what really caught my wife's and my attention was the service of the staff. I've never encountered such amazing service and it's only now that I know why Ritz is actually famous for its service. The staff were extremely friendly and they seemed so genuine. Sometimes you get good service that is purely professional (people being nice just because they have to be in the service line) but at the Colony, we met very genuine people. It's almost as if they hire very good and nice people to begin with. I can't say enough of the friendliness of the staff, their smiles and their impeccable service which included a cake and some drinks on the house for our anniversary. Bala served us throughout and is an extremely nice person. I thank him for making this night seamless and memorable! My wife and I ended up trying to analyse how come their service is so good especially when in SG the service industry is pretty terrible most of the times or nothing to really shout about.The food was great, they have an amazing indian corner that is already enough to fill you. Everything was fantastic generally. The connoiseurs might find some meat (prawns from the Chinese section) a but overcooked but I can forgive because their service overshadows the little shortcomings in food, which was generally great. At $88 ++ it's probably one of the costlier buffets out there but it was a pleasant surprise. Wonderful food, wonderful people, we go home utterly satisfied with the amazing experience. What a relief to know such service standards exist in Singapore.Will definitely go again if given the chance. (Apologies for typos, did this quite in a rush

Excellent spread!
Excellent service
We had a cake sent to our table with much love!
My dad especially liked the nyonya kuehs!

A group of 25 of us had an area of the Colony restaurant set aside for us for a business lunch as part of our conference last week. the sushi bar is superb, and so were the charcuterie on offer. The dessert area is also excellent with a wide variety of yummy treats
5
The quality and food selection for breakfast and dinner is OUTSTANDING. The service is impeccable. The Colony simply cannot be beat. You will not be disappointed - I guarantee it!!
5
Great food and service. Ever attentive and quick to follow up with requests. Also friendly staff. Food was good and delicious with periodical changes to specials for the quarte

I visited Colony with my wife and son to celebrate my son's second birthday. Yes, sometimes we visit Colony for dinner with my family and this is the first time of writing the review. Whenever we visit the Colony we always feel satisfaction thanks to not only the great quality of foods but also very kind staff's good service. Especially, last time Dana, the staff of Colony, was caring us and it was great. She was sincerely caring my baby and us. Dana tried to keep my baby was staying without crying for us and other guests and her effort made us very comfortable. Her service was not just professional staff's but from the heart in her mind, I believe.We gonna visit soon again
5
An amazing restaurant beautifully designed. The place is very cozy and welcoming. The food and service are perfect
5
Impeccable service, staff is attentive to details and it's of the the nicest Hotel buffet in town. A little costly but food is very good. A nice place to go to for any celebrations

Went on a weekday for lunch, so I guess spread is not as wide as dinner. Seafood selection was missing the usual oysters. Salads, cheeses, and cold cuts were great. The roasted duck was tender with crispy skin. Laksa was well done too. The din sum and other Chinese dishes were disappointing. Indian selection made up for it. Nothing stood out in the Western section. I'm not big on dessert and the only fancy item was the fresh made crepe. I enjoyed the various berries that we could add on it. The crepe itself was average. Overall, good service and nice ambience. There are likely other lunch buffets in town with similar spread and quality (maybe even more and better) with a lower price tag
5
I have been to this restaurant many times, last year I was staying at the hotel during the period that the Colony restaurant opened and this year I went again with my wife. The quality is excellent as also the people. I enjoy the service, the food and the smile of the staff. A lot of options to choose from buffet. I have tried most of the food and I liked everything, I recommend it to visit at least once, then you would want to go back for second time.
5
Having already read the reviews about Colony, we had high expectations of the food. We were there to celebrate our friend birthday. The variety is fantastic, it's really worth the trip here! Thank you for bringing such quality food and really good service staff as well!

I went on Tuesday dinner (cost about SGD78 excluding GST and Service Charge, depend on day, it will vary, according to the main website).Although it is quite expensive compare to other buffet, the ambience and food were very satisfying. At first, I doubted that the quality of food would worth the price. But if you are a first timer in this restaurant like I was, I'm sure you will find this restaurant amazing.Restaurant is quite huge and food varies by category.They asked me if I'm visiting the place for the first time, and when I said yes, they gave a brief explanation where & which food are allocated.Location was just nice, around the Orchard area, right beside Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Desserts were all quite in nice, presentable shape and tasty. Although there are not so much of variation for food in my case (I can't take the strong spice_Indian cuisine), and some menus were not there although it was mentioned (especially Xiao Long Bao)They gave 10% discount for DBS, POSB, Citibank and OCBC. I'm not so sure if it's just for a certain period. You can easily find the website and give a call before you decide to go. I made a reservation, but as it was weekdays, most seats were vacant.It is certainly not a place that I would visit again in a month without any "events" due to the cost, but I would surely bring my friends or family for any form of celebration or anniversary
5
We had our anniversary dinner at the colony and we must say that every penny paid is worth it. The ambiance is perfect, the food - especially the cold cuts and seafood is in very gpod quality. lastly the service is one of a kind. We want to specially mention Jiwon for her quick service and Katy who helped my partner with his "surprise". and to the rest of the team at the Colony, thank you for the warm service.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience at the Colony Restaurant, Ritz Carlton. They provide a delightful spread of food and desserts. Coupled with the friendly and professional service (we were attended to by Ken and Reza), who were so attentive to the details. They even noticed some cutlery which we sometimes forgot to take to match the selection of the food we took. We were recommended the rack of lamb with the mint sauce - it was a great recommendation! The icing on the cake was a surprise cake for our celebration that evening - a nice touch! The whole dining experience certainly made for delightful celebration and dining. It did make us feel very welcome and very well taken care of. Great job Ken and Reza, and great dininng experience. Would certainly love to be back again
5
Visited with a group of 8 to celebrate godparent 's wedding anniversary. Nice ambience with a good variety of food. Service was excellent and the waitress Adilla looking after our table was very attentive. A nice touch was a surprise cake with candles for the happy couple. Highly recommended for special occasions
5
The service at Colony was top notch and we had really attentive service from Adila, and the rest of the crew! Food was of excellent quality, and the dinner buffet was value for money. My husband mentioned that we were celebrating my birthday that night and Adila brought out a birthday cake for me, which we were able to bring it home (as we were completely stuffed from the buffet)! All in all, a wonderful experience, and we'll definitely return for more
5
Food is great and service is excellent! Our table was well taken care of by Harvey which made our dining experience awesom
5
Several live stations which is the highlight. Atmosphere is good. However variety can be improved. Quality of food is slightly above average.
5
We just loved it here. The service was excellent right from the warm welcome and throughout the evening. The ambience is great, seating is spread out enough to give privacy. We were seated in a lovely booth.The food was all amazing. So much variety - great fresh seafood including jumbo sized prawns, local cuisine, great Indian food, western food, japanese and much more. I especially loved the salad/cold food bar that had a great selection of cold meats, cheeses and lovely small touches to add to your salad like smoked duck and fresh asparagus.Desserts also great, especially the Colony cake that our waiter brought a piece of to us so as to make sure we got some - one of the best cakes I have ever had.Next time I am in Singapore I will definately return
5
Had a lovely buffet lunch at Colony. The freshness and variety of food was great, especially the fresh seafood, sashimi and sushi. Had the Indian tandoori naan, papadom, curries and condiments. Laksa with lobster ball was ok, not as great as other reviewers mentioned. Dessert of crepe suzette was yummy and there were many ice-cream flavours. Very attentive service staff; compliments to the Ritz-Carlton for their very well-trained staff!
5
Had a great time there as the servers were attentive and offered us a great seat and drinks all night. Food variety is okay, quality & taste is good. Overall had a good time and would recommend for its good value.
5
great variation of food for a reasonable price. the ambiente is however a little old fashioned but a great place to test all different asian food aof high quality and nice presentation
5
Would like to praise one of the staff, Reza! He is really helpful and friendly! Kept offering us drinks during the whole dinner. Even got the initiative to offer us car park coupon before we left. Feel so happy to be served by him!
5
Best buffet we have ever had and we don't like buffets! As many as 15 stations to choose from, many from different countries.
5
During our stay over 12 nights at the Ritz Carlton, we enjoyed breakfast in Colony on 4 occasions as well as enjoying the Sunday Brunch.We booked the Sunday brunch before we arrived, to ensure that we could get into one of the most amazing and extravagant buffet experiences of our lives!The atmosphere and dÃ©cor is beautiful, the restaurant layout creates a feeling of smaller more intimate rooms, rather than a large dining room.There are multiple food stations spread around the restaurant, allowing you to go on quite an amazing food journey.All of the food was of outstanding quality, beautifully presented with the widest array regardless of either breakfast or brunch service.Colony restaurant was definitely one of our WOW experiences while visiting Singapore and I couldn't recommend it highly enough
5
It was my first time at colony and it was an amazing surprise by my boyfriend, Jeremy to celebrate my birthday. The last time was when colony was still the Green House where we went on our first few dates hence the Ritz Carlton is a very special place for us. Not only did I enjoy the wide variety of the buffet spread, we were delighted by the excellent service of Ken and Bertram . Both of them went beyond their way to ensure we had an enjoyable and memorable dinner. Ken had specially brought us Colony's specially dessert and checked in with us regularly to ensure we were well taken care of. Bertram especially introduced us to their signature dishes and expertly prepared them. Kudos to all the staff whose excellent service will remain in our hearts for always. Looking forward to our next trip
5
Food selection is great and of high quality. The ambience is perfect for a romantic date, just do not expect a window view overlooking the Singapore skyline. The service was magnificent. Our server, Firdous, should be commended. He was very courteous and had always anticipated our needs. He ensure that we are having a great time. We were also given a slice of cake and champagne as anniversary treats. There was some minor hiccup during the payment of bill though, we were told that there will be a 10% discount for the restaurant's preferred credit card, so we went ahead and used that card and paid. After paying, we were approached by the cashier that we were charged with the full amount (w/o discount), so he had to swipe our card again for the correct amount. He was very apologetic though and after checking, we were not charged twice. So all is good. This experience will not stop us from going back to Colony and recommending it to friends.

The variety of food will make any of your travel companion or guest very happy. Not only that but the incredible ladies and gentlemen who hosts your table are ON POINT. I actually didnt come for the food, I came for the experience and to be in a place of excellence where excellent people are. I am a big foodie so for me to want to be in a place NOT for the food is quite uncommon. The Colony brings the history of Singapore TO YOU, directly to your plate (if you choose) in such a delightful way. There are so many options for those with food allergies and sensitive palates. Everything looked immaculate and gorgeous, even the wonderful cooks and staff. I was thoroughly impressed by the Juice bar, where you were greeted with a fresh, chilled and unique beverage by the lovely hosts there. Today I had the pink beverage (rose fused in soy milk) which was so light tasting, but super refreshing. You must try this.There is also the pasta cassanova ( you know who you are, Eugene) who cooks you a plate of pasta with your choice of meats, sauces and pasta type.As I said before, Colony is a place of culinary and service excellence. The ladies and gentlemen are always so amazing and attentive. If you want to treat someone special in your life, the team at Ritz-Carlton will ensure that special person and special occassion will be a memorable one. I also want to give a big thank you to Fridaus our host, it was an honour and pleasure to be served by you, and to shake hands with a person of excellence, I hope your excellence rubs onto me. You are an asset to your company and an asset most especially to the guest you hosts. Thank you for being a model ambassador for Ritz-Carlton and going above and beyond what we had not even requested for.

Was there on May 16 to celebrate my daughter birthday. The buffet spread is excellent and variety is good. Very good selection of desserts. Was surprised there is a fresh juice counter. The wait staff is very well trained and service is first class. Definitely going back again.

Few days ago, I went to Colony of Ritz Calton Singapore to eat dinner. I really appreciate for staff services and I may not update with my every impression.When i enter from Entrance, I had slightly disappointed due to a woman who korean was greeting guest at colony entrance.when i ask our seat to her, she just indicated our seat using her finger and never care us. she just care another person. she just ignored our every mentions and request. However Ms. Vivian took care us well. she guided us to our seat.I really want to mention for colony staff, especiallyMs. Hyacinth Honey, Ms. Grace, Mr.Jun, Chef. Young and another chefs, Mr. Rethish and of course, Ms. Vivian also.They gave outstanding services to us, and I really appreciate for their kindliness.Even I had disappointed first time, they were professional staffs that have kind and passionate.Thank you for all of colony staff and if i have a chance to visit colony, hopefully, i will go there with my expectation.Thank you guys

Everyone is happy at Colony's buffet, western is yummy, Chinese food is delicious, local is well done and nice dessert spread! All round happy!

Ultra fresh seafood. Nice selection of food. Awesome juicing bar where you can choose the fruits you want to have cold pressed and they'll do it for you. Staff was helpful, attentive and accommodating .
4
I came here for lunch with a large group of colleagues, 17 of us and we were given a long table, prepared before our arrival.Service at the restaurant was top notch. The greeters at the entrance were professional and showed us to our table with warmth.The food was of good quality, you can taste that the ingredients used were all very fresh. I started with a round of sashimi, and cold cuts. The salmon sashimi was very good. The cooked food section had quite a good selection. I liked their laksa, the satay, and the double boiled soup. When it came to desserts, there were many cakes to choose from. But what I liked was the mixed berries, which you could indulge yourself with scoops of blue berries and raspberries. It was a good dining experience and would be longing to return for more
5
The service is superb. When we said it's our first time to this buffet lunch, a lady introduced us to the various food stations before being brought to our seats. Amber Huang was serving the section we were seated. Her warmth n her smile n her quick n efficient service made our lunch a really memorable one. My husband loved the sashimi and the wide range of dessert, while I enjoyed the Indian n Chinese dragon beard dim sum. Good food n fantastic service! Highly recommended
5
Ate here on Saturday 7 May as an early mother's Day celebration. Food was great for most part, especially the 4 varieties of oyster, a cold pressed fruit juice bar (the jewel of the buffet) and an amazing home made Laksa with lobster balls! Pass on the frozen lobster which they serve as thermidor, and dive for the grilled live prawns instead- char grilled awesomeness. The highlight of the dinner was the manager Ken, who when noting our disappointment with the lack of the signature yuzu scented colony cake at the buffet, went to great lengths to find us a slice. They ran out completely, but he gave us instead a thick slice of gianduja chocolate cake. Which made us smile and made our day. Thanks Ken and colony for an great evening
5
It's my first time here and brought my friend to pre-celebrate her Birthday, I am quite impressed by the new makeover of the restaurant. It was a wonderful evening and the service was excellent, personal which is beyond my expectation. The supervisor, Ken Fong even arranged their speciality cake which is not available at the dessert counter for my friend. He even offered to provide some complimentary parking coupons. He was good in delivering the best service for the customers and improved constantly from the feedbacks he received.The food could have been better with more selection.I would certainly come back here for the wonderful dining experience again
5
This is our second visit to Colony and this place never fail to impress. We were there to celebrate Mother's day because our parents love their food so much and they have such picky palate. A wide variety of food to choose from, fresh seafood, delicious pastries, love their juice station and tea selection. Colony has such lovely ambiance it is perfect to have a family dinner for any occasion. We especially enjoy the service of their staff. Ken, Rethish and Ellie were so attentive, friendly and lovely. They were always smiling and making sure we are comfortable and enjoying our dinner. Colony is the place where you get to enjoy awesome food with great ambiance and brilliant service and we know we are going back for more. Ken, Rethish and team, keep it up

Called in to book a table & be informed they are fully booked. So, we reserved a table at Summer Pavilion. When passed by the restaurant & noticed there are still some empty tables then check again with staff then they said still available....We were so bad to cancelled the reservation at Summer Pavilion & give it a try at Colony since found out there are a lot of good comments.The seafood selections for lunch is very little & under expectation. Maybe those who gave good comments were being there during non-peak season or dine during dinner. I hope the restaurant can improve on this since during peak season, you should have more revenue to provide more selections of food or high quality of seafood if you would likes to impress customer due to the varieties are limited.My MIL only favorable to the "Hainanese white cut chicken" even some are undercook. During the last order, I requested the chef to give me the drumstick which my MIL requested but I need to bargain with the chef likes in kopitiam then he allow to give me the only piece of drumstick. The reason being he gave is he scares the mgmt will scold if he gave me the drumstick & he not able to provide to customer who is ordering on ala-carte which really scratch my head. The Patisserie station also no much selection especially I saw a fly is dancing around there....Nevertheless, the Lobster ball laksa & wantan mee (which got a home fell) are the must try items at Colony. The chicken satay also nice but I only managed to got two sticks cuz too popular or too little quantities compared to lamb or beef satay.Overall should said is average according to the price paid cuz the qualities, quantities & varieties are under expectation. I do not have much during this buffet which is to celebrate my birthday. What I want is not there. Maybe next year then try their dinner buffet then know what are the variances. Hopefully do not disappointed me again..
5
It was great. The food, atmosphere, and and company. But, one person made it better, and that was Ken. He was very attentive, warm, and made our dining experience better beyond expectations. Ken was the epitome of service and hospitality, and I was impressed with his attitude and work ethic. I'm very thankful for him for making my first Mother's Day a memorable and pleasant one, when he could and should have been home accompanying his mother instead.
5
Wow what a revelation - Colony was closed when we stayed in the hotel last year but has now opened and is fantastic. After a gruelling flight from the UK the salad buffet was a perfect light meal. A beautiful selection of cold fish , sushi, oysters, prawns , tuna etc was available. The cold meats were superb and a great choice of salad ingredients and cheese. All so fresh and beautifully presented. BUT what made this meal special was the wonderful and attentive service - absolutely superb ! The Deseret we were brought as we finished our wine was brilliant.Fantastic gluten free meal with gluten free savoury and sweet bread available. Good ambiance just a perfect end to a long day !
5
Dinner buffet offered a wide selection of quality food. Service staff were observant, friendly and quick to attend to us. Ambience was fit for a king too. Looking forward to my future visits.
5
First time visiting Colony and was served by Ken & Harvey, they provided us awesome service by giving us prompt attention and always checking if we are doing fine.They made this dining experience a memorable one. They are definitely an asset to Colony. Please keep up the good work guys! Thank you for the birthday cake and the chocolates:)
5
It was my first time dining at the Colony Restaurant. Great ambience and reasonable amount of choices for food. What catches my attention the most was that, your 2 staff.. Ken & Harvey. They show excellent service to us! Both of us keep on smilling throughout our time there.. Nowadays its kind of hard to get a genuine & quality service & having them in your restaurant surely will make most diners walk out smiling... Will definitely return. Thumbs up!
4
We've had family from Europe in town and they appreciated the wide range of western and asian food. Overall very good quality and selection and ambiance.
5
My wife and I ate at Colony last night. There is such a large selection of food it is hard to know what to have. The highlights for us were the laksa with homemade lobster balls, the Singaporean savoury pastries and the chilli crab. The drinks package at $52 per person is very reasonably as you get unlimited beer, wine and spirits. Note the buffet and the bar closes at 10.30 so it is better to book for an early seating so you can enjoy without having to rush
5
Compliments specially to Grace and Nina for their attentiveness to our table. Also like to commend all staff at Ritz. From the moment we stepped into the hotel, all the warm & genuine smiles. Love the service as always, my favourite hotel in Singapore!Food was mixed. Some were very good, others only normal
5
I made a dinner reservation @ Colony to celebrate my wife's and daughter's birthday. We had a wonderful evening, with the nice ambience, good mix of food as well as the great service. Special thanks to Ken for showing great attention to details, such as arranging the birthday cake, always serving with patience and great smile. Overall, a memorable family time for us. Will definitely be back again. Thank you
5
My fiancé and I had a wonderful time. Food and ambience was great! There was a really wonderful, very joyful Korean lady by the name of Grace who served our table. She went out of her way to give us a small cake when she found out we were celebrating our anniversary that day! It was completely unexpected but made the lunch all the more memorable! Totally going to tell others about what a good time we had!
5
Good spread of delicious food. Restaurant staff provide excellent service. Asst. Manager Gene Del Barrio is a capable leader, courteous,efficient and attentive. Ambience is comfortable with soothing music. Overall it is definitely value for money
5
Had intermittent chats with Rethish Rajan, 'The Manager of Weights' - who takes special concern that customers must leave with at least 2kg heavier after a meal at Colony. Great sense of humour. Constantly asked if everything was ok. We met two interns: Winnie and Firdaus who provided smiles as they served us. Gave some positive compliments to their immaculate service. We were surprised with a 'Happy 40th Anniversary' cookie after our meal
5
Cleverly designed restaurant that allows some intimacy despite being a comprehensive buffet. The food was all top notch and the service was probably the best we have experienced in any hotel in Singapore.
5
This is the best buffet restaurant in Singapore. Cost is $78 during the week. The food is absolutely first class, and covers almost every type of cuisine, from Huge rib roasts, to Indian, to well, almost every type. Allow for 2 hours at least, so you can munch through them all
5
My wife and I visied Singapore for our honeymoon and stayed in Ritz-Carlton for two nights.Colony was the best restraunt I've ever visited in Singapore. There were many kinds of food and the quality of each food was also great. We could experience all kinds of signature food of singapore such as chilly crab, raksa, chicken rice, etc.Service was also nice. In particular, Ms. Grace and Dana introduced their restraunt very kindly and recommended special cuisines of hir restruant. Their special consideration made our dinner more delightful and special. We were very satisfied of their services and food. Colony could be the best choice for trevelers in Singapore even they don't stay in Reitz-Carlton
5
I've been to so many buffet place in Singapore but I promise you by the time you step in to Colony, you'll feel the vibe, the atmosphere you've never experienced before. The attentiveness from the staff and such good quality food will blow you away. The waiter/waitress kept coming back to our table to clear, refill, and replace. They didn't miss anything as far as I remember. Their attention to the details was very impressive. Half way, (their staff) Mr. Ken attended our table and politely assist us with our needs. Picture taking, coffee order, even gave me a little something from the restaurant (since it's my birthday) such as birthday cake and chocolate as their present. With this impeccable service I really wouldn't mind to pay more than what I should pay!Overall, I would like to thank the staff for making my bday celebration memorable. My friends love the experience and so do I. Great job on the service and hope to come back again soon!
5
What more could you ask for?Their excellent customer service gave us an insight in how professional the crews were trained and how well they communicated among themselves. I am truly amazed by the small little details which they actually took notice and work on it.Food is magnificent and comprehensive. I have never once doubted their quality and standard. Ritz Carlton certainly live up to their name
5
We are 4 friends having a birthday celebration and the service, right from the start till the end of the feast is worthy of Standing Ovation. Grace who attended to us was very efficient, always making sure all our needs are met like getting us drinks from the fruit bar, replenished my coffee knowing it was turning cold and generated much joy to the occasion by her joyful personality and authentic kind spirit.
5
Delicious food, excellent service, gallons of champagne. Sam was especially helpful and charming. The staff is excellently trained, bends over backwards to help with any requests. The food is luxurious - lobster, oysters, beef Wellington, foies gras, etc. And the setting is beautifully updated. Recommended for a perfect day-waster! Sunday's were never so fun!
5
What brought us back to this restaurant was the variety and quality of food it offers. What surprised us was the TOP notch service we experienced this time round. The servers made effort to chat with us and their warm reception made the dining experience complete. Ken, Liz and the team did an amazing job
5
Really really good spread as expected from ritz. The started station had a huge spread of appetizers. Yummy options include steam chicken rice, beef noodles, mango banana juice and sashimi. The desserts were not that good though, despite the wide array of choices. Very attentive and helpful wait staff. Definitely a place to revisit.
5
Delicious food, great atmosphere, awesome setting.When in Singapore trying the buffet for lunch at Colony is worth spending your money. There are 7 different food stations and I sorry that I cant recall them all right now. But they have everything you can imagine. The great selection of seafood got me hooked. I started with perfectly sliced salmon and tuna sashimi and tried lobster and crab after. This was only the beginning!I love the restaurants setting with many picture galleries around the tables it has a very urban feeling. Still very chic, but raw and urban, don't know how to explain, but take a look at the pictures.The dessert station is a true feast too. Just too much choice actually. What to do when you like all sweets? OMG I just wished I came 1,5h earlier so I could do 2 or 3 rounds!Another cool feature was the mobile cocktailbar that had great mojitos, with berry infused cream on top
5
Variety of food and all in high quality. Staff were very friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is good.
5
We dined at Colony this evening celebrating my husband's birthday. When we arrived, we were warmly greeted by the staff who quickly checked off the list for my reservation and took us to our table. The restaurant was recently renovated and re-opened in September 2015. The decor was sort of French colonial and everything was done extremely tastefully. We dined with our 6 and 4 year old. Even though there were no dedicated kids section, there was no shortage of food for them. The kids dined on some dim sum, noodles, pasta and lots and lots of ice-cream. Plastic dining ware were available for the kids and so many staff came by to make sure that the kids were having a nice time and offering to get them more food.The spread of food was amazing. The seafood buffet line would do many other similar ones to shame. There were oysters from France and Canada, scallops, mussels, 2 kinds of clams, crabs and prawns with 6 different kinds of sauces as accompaniment. There was a large sushi/sashimi bar. The salad bar was overflowing with fresh greens and various toppings. Husband particularly liked the fresh beetroot.There was also a beverage section with juices and other drinks like Barley with fresh thyme leaves. There was so much hot food to choose from - pastas, roast meats (Western and Asian style), satay. There was also an Indian station, Noodle Station (Laksa is outstanding) and a local Singaporean food section (Singapore Chilli Crab is the one to go for. There was also a dim sum station with the usual culprits like har gow, siu mai, char siu bao. There was also soon kueh (local steamed dumpling filled with turnip).We had a few cocktails before and during dinner - Daiquiri came out tops.The dessert section had a huge offering of cakes, crumbles, cannollis, Peranakan sweets as well as home-made ice-cream with toppings to delight the little ones.As it was a birthday celebration, we were also offered a few complimentary cocktails and the birthday boy got a big slice of cake, enough for all 4 of us to share after a big dinner.Children 6-12 cost $39/pax and Adults $78/pax. This is AMAZING value considering the quality of the food and variety offered.My compliments to Ken, who was extremely attentive to our table all evening. My husband had delivered me a bowl of laksa and forgot to grab a pair of chopsticks. I looked at the bowl of noodles for 3 seconds, thinking about whether or not I should be bothered getting up to grab one myself. As soon as I picked up the fork, Ken came up to the table offering me a pair of chopsticks. THIS is the kind of service we need every where else.We will DEFINITELY be back to Colony very soon. I must commend Ritz-Carlton Millenia for a wonderful evening and dining experience
5
This is my seventh visit to the Ritz Carlton Hotel Singapore. The eighth will be in May of this year. We always stay in the Club section but on the last two occasions we had different experiences in that on the first occasion the Club was undergoing a massive refurbishing programme. On this occasion the entire Club was booked out by a Company. However all was not entirely lost we were accommodated for meals and relaxation by the Colony Restaurant where a charming lady by the name of Gene Del Barrio, The Assistant Manager, took professional control of all our needs - thank you Gene, We shall return mid May and will visit you again
5
We were at Colony for lunch on our wedding anniversary. The ambience of the newly renovated restaurant added a class of its own. As we were ushered to our table a polite and pleasant young waiter by the name of Ragan offered to give us a tour of the buffet areas. He was enthusiastic and had good knowledge of the food and even told us the history behind certain food and desserts. We were rather impressed by his countenance and service which we did not get at other similar hotels. We could have missed the famous crepe Suzette and learnt the history behind the crepe Suzette if Ragan didn't offer to bring it to our table before the counter closed. The crepe was to die for (crepe with the right texture and sauce the right acidity level), we are glad we tried it! On our way out he brought us some gifts with a personal written card (to wish us happy anniversary, yes, with our name on it!) We have to congratulate Ritz Carlton for their staff's excellent service (including Ragan, Ken the manager and other members of the team who were all very courteous and helpful) a delicious array of food, great decor and ambience. We wouldn't hesitate coming back

Since the last time when we had dinner there on a Friday it left me with a very deep impression of very fresh seafood and Boston Maine lobsters . Felt disappointed that these items were no longer on the menu. The oysters were a bit of a let down as they looked a bit undernourished . Put me off after the first few. Popish done by the lady kitchen helper the last time we were there looked and tasted like popiah. This time round I leave it to your imagination. Did not touch your local and Indian selection.

The colony is the main restaurant for breakfast at the Ritz Carlton. It is recently renovated with an interesting design with many alcoves, interesting decor and large number of food stations. Food is excellent with great choice. On last day at hotel spent more than 2 hours over breakfast! Still only tries less than 20% of the choices

While this is a buffet restaurant in a large hotel, this is not your by-the-numbers buffet that you would get in many places. The food is very good, with a wide variety of choices. Some of the local dishes are quite good. The service is great too, as you would expect in a Ritz Carlton. If I have on minor complaint - it is that the food is spread out over so many different locations, behind pillars, etc, that you don't get to see everything on offer. I suggest taking a long walk around the whole restaurant before deciding what you want. Very often you finish, only to realise that you missed something good

We went to The Colony for a family dinner - the food menu was limited, but the quality of food was excellent ! Special compliments to the chef for the steak .... It was perfect. The staff was courteous and ambience quite nice. The hotel should do something about its entrance at the main road though - lacks visibility and lights and easy to miss...

We visited Colony for our Sunday Brunch, and has left such a deep impression on me that I had to make an exception and leave a review on tripadvisor. For starters, the buffet brunch selection was comprehensive, and quality of food was consistent through all 8 live stations available there. Especially commendable dishes were the Wagyu beef, fresh oysters, sashimi, and strawberry shortcake. However, my main purpose of penning down this review is to commend on the two staff - Nina and Sam. The service they provided was one of the best that we have experienced thus far, having had our fair share of excellent services in other hotels or fine dining restaurants both locally and abroad. Sam was highly proactive and offered his services (without prompting) to take a picture for us on his own initiative. Not only that, he was very patient with our photo requests, and took good shots of us enjoying our meal! Nina on the other hand, was an extremely passionate and thoughtful service staff who tried all means to offer us the best service she could provide. While we requested for recommendations on the desserts available in the buffet, she took the initiative to ask the chefs for their recommendation, and even offered to bring the dessert on our behalf to our table. Moreover, may I add that she was the only service staff there who was always ready to offer a smile regardless of whatever she was doing in hand. We could feel her passion to serve and ensure that all customers at Ritz-Carlton experiences the best that the hotel and her can provide.The good food and service has definitely made Colony my must-visit-again brunch places. The excellent service, especially by the two staff above, has definitely set the bar high for other hotels and restaurants! Kudos to the two of them for maintaining the standards of Singapore and Ritz-Carlton, and thank you for such an enjoyable brunch

Had a wonderful dinner last Tuesday at Colony. Not only that it was a very visually appealing restaurant, but the spread was well thought of. It offered a wide range of the classic favorites from Singapore such as chili crab, cereal prawns, and hainanese chicken rices as well as western, Indian, Chinese and Japanese cuisines. Oysters were fresh and sweet and the dessert offerings is something to look forward too. As always the ritz culture is there thus the service is tip top and always with a smile
5
Food was excellent and there were 3 segments; cold/appetizer, hot foods, and desserts/fruits(and when my wife said was excellent; trust me is good). Service staffs worked very hard, thanks you.

Was here in Feb and back again in April. Quality of food is still good and in fact, I find the selection especially for the dessert a lot more interesting this time round.The bugbear for us during our previous visit was the attentiveness of the wait staff. However, I am glad that this has definitely seen improvements with our most recent visit. In particular, I would like to call out Mr Rethish who saw to all our needs and we are all very pleased and satisfied this time round. Keep up the good job for listening to feedback from reviewers
5
The Sunday Brunch is always competitive in Singapore, but Colony has become our favorite. The selection is very good across the board, maybe desserts could do with a little more work, although if you like cakes you will be fine. They have a nice range of oysters and the sashimi is very fresh. For roasts, the veal is always nice and this time they had beef Wellington which was cooked to perfection. It's not cheap, but I would say it's good value.

I celebrated my birthday at The Colony buffet lunch with my daughter and we both found that it exceeded all our expectations.Upon arrival we received a very friendly greeting from a young lady (I'm sorry that I didn't make a note of her name). She explained all the types of food available and where we could find them and then led us to a very comfortable booth.Immediately waitress Dana arrived and asked us if we would like iced or warm water and from that moment on our cups of warm water were never allowed to become empty. Empty plates were also whisked away promptly.The choice and quality of the food was amazing. Special mention must go to the spring rolls which were freshly prepared as we waited. My daughter loves sushi and said that it was the best she had tasted. I'm not a fan of seafood, but there was a good choice of cold seafood for those who do, and I enjoyed some prawn salad from the selection of salads on offer. The hot food selection was varied and the meats tender.The desert selection was also outstanding, and towards the end of our meal two lovely waitresses arrived at our table with a birthday cake and sang "Happy Birthday" to me.The ambience of the restaurant is wonderful. It is classy, but not so stuffy that families with young children would feel out of place. In fact, near us was a family with two young children that seemed to be having an enjoyable time. The tables are far enough apart to ensure privacy and you don't feel as if you're eating in a cafeteria.I must make special mention of our waitresses Dana, Ng and Ellie who contributed so much towards making my Birthday so memorable and, of course, to the excellent chefs who provided such amazing food.I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in Singapore
5
I had a wonderful experience at this restaurant, the staffs are excellence in customer service especially this staff "Nadeem Ram" whom is serving us most of the time. Thumbs up
5
Very nice food and worth the money. The quality of food and service makes the value of $$$$ worth for spending. The manager, service crew has excellent attitude. Thank you Rethish, will sure come back and strongly recommend to my family and friends
5
The refurbished restaurant creates an airy but clean and calm environment, excellent for a family or business lunch, but also suited for an extended and more intimate dinner. The selection of food is superb, of every conceivable variety and taste, blending both the best of Singapore's culinary traditions with those of a more international cuisine. Everything is beautifully displayed, and the staff are attentive, helpful, and genuinely nice and welcoming. Highly recommended as one of the best buffets in Singapore
5
Had visited the restaurant a few times for lunch and everytime i really enjoyed it. The food was really good. A great mixture of western and asian cusines. Staff were really attentive too. Special mention to Mr Raj, he was one funny guy who makes our lunch even more enjoyable with his jokes. Will come back in the futur
5
Visited the restaurant on 30 March to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Staff took us to our seat despite being 15 min earlier before the start of the buffet. There was a wide variety of food and they were up to our expectations. Special compliments to two staff who served us throughout our dinner. (So sorry that I didn't manage to get their names; one of them was his first day of his work while the other staff has his name initial B?) They were very friendly and attentive. They actually acceded to my last min request for a mini birthday cake. Cleared our plates promptly and top up my cup of warm water when noted that I was coughing badly. Small gestures that really warmed our hearts. We will definitely be back if we have a chance to again.
5
Went to Colony with my other half for her birthday, was greeted by a friend of mine, Raj upon arriving at the restaurant. Was quickly given a seat (i made a reservation), and without further ado head straight for the food. IMO, the Lobster Ball Laksa was one of the best, not to forget their roasted delicacies as well. Personally i am quite a meat lover, and despite the fact, the meat available at Colony itself was still one of the best i've ever tasted!Will definitely recommend this for Businesses Retreats, Couples, Anniversary and definitely Families(The Variety @ Colony.. you've to see it to believe it

We came for Afternoon Tea over the long Good Friday-Easter weekend. And we wished we didn't!Service - Part 1:We were seated at our table but NOBODY informed us what kind of Afternoon Tea would be served! Nobody asked us what drink we would like. We literally sat there like some "goondus" for a good 20 mins! FINALLY I had to walk up to an Indian waiter (because nobody seem to be looking our way even though I was waving away like a mad person!). We were then informed by an older man that the Afternoon Tea is buffet style. And then told that all guests dining that day for Afternoon Tea would get a glass of Moet et Chandon. Great and thank you! This is possibly the only highlight that afternoon.Food:The weekend Afternoon Tea (Buffet style) consists mostly of sandwiches. If you were a fan of the Weekend Afternoon Tea at Chihuly Lounge, this one pales miserably in comparison. Service - Part 2:Service by the largely inexperienced Indian staff is not befitting of an establishment like Ritz Carlton. The Indian guy and other Indian waiters gave us the type of service you would expect in a hawker center! You can wave at them till you turn blue & they will pretend not to notice you! Seriously alarming. The Filipino(a) wait staff saved the day! I really really really really miss the Afternoon Tea at Chihuly Lounge and the experienced wait staff! Dear Ritz Carlton Millenia - you gotta do right and clear up this mess! We customers don't like paying premium prices to dine here and be faced with below sub-par service!!! Rating for food: 6/10. Rating for service: 3/10. Rating for ambience: 10/10. Overall rating: 4.5/10! I AM NOT COMING BACK! Ritz Carlton Millenia, you just lost a long time customer.

Dine in the colony restaurant while we were staying at the Ritz Carlton, the choices of food was amazing and the service was excellent.
5
My family and I enjoyed the delicious & wide selection of buffet spread last evening. The seafood was fresh and replenished immediately so much so we didn't have to wait long to enjoy the selection we want. Very attentive and friendly staff. Thank you to Rethish and his team for making my sister's birthday a good one.
5
We had a group of friends having reunion dinner. Food was amazing and service. I would like to congrates Chef Nicolas and Jay the supervisor for his excellence food and service for our table. Special highlight the juice station and salad corner was my favorite. Seafood & sashimi was fresh and well displayed. Dessert must try the Tiramisu and Chocalate mousse cake

Made a online reservation via email - lunch for hubby's birthday.- upon arrival staff ask if we hav reservation. Did not ask for reservation under whose name. Told her yes there is a reservation n she usher us to our table. - requested a change of table as it was too near to the entrance n was done promptly. No issues.- staff didn't check my name when I told her I hav made a reservation n have a special request. Only then the staff ask for my name n say ya she aware of the special request - complimentary cake.- we had our lunch n I was waiting if any staff will come n ask if they can bring the complimentary cake, no one did till I hav to ask myself. - when the cake arrive the staff sang the song when I hav requested no singing.- not sure what is the meaning of special request when it is not being communicated to the staff.- also the staff at the entrance they were seen whispering n giggling when I approach them without my Husband to confirm they know about the cake request.- each time me n my Husband walk pass by them they r seem whispering after looking at us.....is it cause of we were not in dress n business suit......we was not under dress for lunch.- we did not felt the welcome lunching at colonyFirst n last time dining at colony as your (colony) first impression is very disappointing where a birthday lunch turn to a disappointing afternoon with the unprofessionalism way of the staff handling the whole thing from reservation to serving the complimentary cake.

First up, it has an amazing salad display! Fresh green leaves, whole avocado cut to order amazing colour to feast your eyes on!Next you lay your eyes on the gourmet sandwiches... What!? Who has space for that at a buffet. Trust me... You won't regret it!Chilled seafood... Lovely...Sushi and sashimi, again, fresh and beautiful... Best of all, you can see the chef moulding the sushi rice traditionally. You know this wasn't factory made!Local counter has beautiful roasts (chicken, pork..)...Western counter has beautiful roasts! Even mini beef stew in a mini classic French lion head bowls!Indian counter, beautiful spread...My heart sinks as I view the local noodles and HK steamed dim sum... I have run out of space!!! Panic, I need to start prioritising...Don't worry, head to the juice bar for a palate cleanser!Of course there was the dessert bar that is hard to miss. It's the first thing you see when you enter. As if to make sure you remember to save some space for it. It's really more of a cake shop that you can help your self to everything. Don't forget to have a made to order CrÃªpe Suzette topped with ice-cream!

Most of the food was well-prepared and delicious. Salmon sashimi was extremely fresh and smooth! Tuna and yellowfin were above average. Roast pork & duck were crispy outside but juicy inside, char siew was tough. Pasta, laksa and other cooked dishes were all well done! Desserts were all yummy too. Only disappointment was fruit juices that were passed on as fresh but weren't
5
The ritz does not disappoint with its breakfasts, lunches and weekend buffets, be sure to book as it is always packed! there newly renovated Colony aka Green house, is perfect for lunch meetings, families, couples! Favourite places!
5
Celebrating my GF birthday with the colony. It was very busy that night. I could say is almost full house. Having dinner with friends n my GF. Reservation was made earlier.We were greeted by kelvin that direct us to our seats. And serve by Grace (if I got it correct) is a buffet style clearing of plates was efficient. Altogether the service is perfect and flawless, however I still disappoint on the food, especially the laksa that doesn't taste like what I had in the hawker center. Like the freshly shucked oyster station. Local singapore cuisine doesn't taste like what I like, seems like lacking of certain flavor.However it is still a good dining experience with friends
5
One of the most sought-after and worth it buffet experience I had with the Colony at Ritz Carlton. Not many buffet offer you fresh fruit juice, but here at Colony, you even get to mix and match! They also have an extensive range of dessert & chocolates & ice cream to choose from. Getting the ladies a little excited now.The highlight would be their meat station, they have the Grills for beef, lamb to local delicacies like Chicken Rice, Laksa, Chili crab to seafood like salmon, mussels and oysters. Their steam bun and siew mai is a little disappointing but compensate with their abalone soup (individual portion & limited)All in all, their service is really good and attentive. Will definitely return one day for special occasion. We celebrated our 5th Anniversary with Colony and they prepared a cake for us out of goodwill! Good gesture :
5
We stayed at the Ritz Carlton and had dinner and breakfast there. Amazing presentation and choices. Must eat there no matter where you stay.
4
Great variety of food present in the buffet. Was staying in the hotel and thus was entitled to the buffet. The staff was professional and prompt in attending to requests.
5
We wanted Pepper and Chili Crab in Singapore, but did not have time to go to Jumbo ... we asked at Colony and the chef said no problem, so we ordered 3 crabs. They tasted excellent. Also for breakfast, perfect selection of food and juices, as with lunch a great and assorted buffet
5
Took my family last night for my husband's birthday dinner to the Colony. I love the food variety which is great when you go with your family or friends. The food is fresh, very tasty and of high quality. The service was amazing. Waiters are always around you, clean the dirty dishes and even served us food (as I tried to carry too many things at once). What was the most amazing thing: I wanted to give a tip to the waiters as their service was so outstanding but they rejected as they said they serve from the heart. Lee Lee you were my superstar. Thank you Colony and Ritz Carlton for a wonderful evenin
5
Wide variety of food, fresh oysters and sashimi. Love the fresh juice bar and dessert section. Service was good, plates were cleared promptly. Good dining experienc

Visited the place on 3rd March to celebrate my anniversary. Was really excited for "the good food and excellent services" as seen on most reviews. However, I left disappointed. Firstly, the food was average at best, with a lot of absentees in the menu that was sent to me when I first enquired. In addition, our table was always filled with plates as it would take up to 40mins for someone to bother clearing our table. Lastly, when I initially made a reservation with them, I told them that I was celebrating my anniversary and was told that I would be given a complimentary cake. I was planning on surprising my girlfriend with this, but they seemed to have forgotten about it altogether which was bitterly disappointing. I really feel that Colony can improve their services and food options to match its wonderful ambience
5
The food spread, and food quality was awesome! So much to choose from and the service staff always ensured that we were well taken care of!
5
This is my third time here with family. We loved the big head prawns, grilled lobsters and beef. The juice station was amazing as we get to choose the fruits we liked to blend into. The dessert bar had a wide selection which looked like a pastry and cake shop just that it's unlimited
5
The Ritz-Carlton is always known for service, and this restaurant doesn't disappoint. My wife and I went to celebrate and upon entering were immediately ushered to our awaiting table. Many high-end dishes. The sushi was superb, and not to be missed. Artisian cheeses, Indian, Chinese and many other ethnic cuisines were offered. The only issue was desserts, several were dead-on, some were just "average", like the cheesecake. A strong thumbs-u
5
Thank you to lovely member of staff, Luna Bajracharya, who made the booking for my friends on a busy evening. We just arrived in Singapore and to be given such high standard and variety of food was an amazing experience. All the staff were most helpful and so helpful. This is a must place for every visitor to Singapore
5
The concept is of different cooking stations serving different nationalities of food. Wow the choice is incredible. If you go for the wine option it's great value and you get unlimited sparkling, White & red wine

Following the renovation and transformation of Greenhouse into Colony, I find the décor classier and it gives the café a more upmarket feel compared to the previous Greenhouse. The overall food selection is good, fresh and well represented with the 7 stations; did not even get round to trying the Indian and Wok stations. With greater emphasis on healthy eating, I especially like the fruit section which has a good selection that you can also select and have them juiced. Thoroughly enjoyed the grilled seafood, roast beef and spaghetti aglio olio but the laksa is overrated – it tasted good but not over the top and while the lobster ball is unique there is nothing pushing me back for a second serve. As noted on several reviews, the wait staffs seem quite loss and lack of attentiveness; we had to request several times for our plates to be cleared even though they are many of them standing around
4
Very good price for the selection they have. Its casual dining, place is recently renovated. Food is quite good (not superb but good), service is more than ok. If you're a dessert person, u're gonna love their dessert bar as they have so many to choose from (well u don't have to choose actually cuz u can try all) and the matcha cake is so light, really really good. and their lunch buffet price is mon-sat. but it's short timing so be there by 12, last order is 2.15
3
I totally agree with tropic3 about the food and restaurant.It has a great ambience. Service on the whole is very good but a bit of hit and miss depending on the person. The waitresses were chatting away even she saw us standing in front of the desk for a while waiting to be seated. One waiter took away our unfinished food. However, most of them are friendly and efficient.The starters are a bit boring and the seafood is not very nice. Crayfish seem have a strange textile and scallops are chewy. The roast duck is overdone. The Chinese dumplings are sitting there for too long and are dry. The sushi and sashimi are very good. Indian food is just fine but nothing to write home about. Most deserts are not particularly nice.I will not recommend you this restaurant especially there are many nice brunch venues around town. This is definitely not good value for money nor very enjoyable as the food is very very average
5
Had the buffet dinner with a couple of friends. I've been to a fair number of buffets and this one ranks up there with the best. The spread is so vast and of such high quality, it was quite difficult to try everything that I wanted to. For those of you not used to buffets, pace yourself. Take small amounts of everything just to have a taste. And when you think you have had enough of the savouries, there is the bewildering variety of desserts that await you. Wow, just wow. All of us left with pains in our bellies but happiness in our hearts.
5
One must experience a Sunday brunch at Colony once in one's life. It really is a decadent afternoon, spent in a beautifully decorated room, surrounded by copious amount of really tasty food! Skip breakfast, come hungry, leave happy (happier if someone else picks up the tab
4
This was my 1st visit to Ritz Carlton's Colony restaurant. There were 7 of us and we had their dinner buffet prices at $88++ per person.There were 6 live kitchens where the chefs cook up a storm serving local dishes as well as western dishes.There is a cold seafood corner as well, which serves salmon, oysters etc.I did read up some reviews for the must try dishes such as Laksa, chicken rice, crab and desserts. Well, honestly, I did not find the food tasty. It is of course subjective, but I think the hawkers serve tastier chicken rice & laksa.The chilli crab was on the sweet side, indian section had tough meats and naan. I did try many of their dishes but only the tiger prawn is memorable. The rest of the dished I tried were rather ordinary and nothing that tops what I've tasted before.Anyway, they have a juice bar with assorted flavours. The desserts were good. There was Tiramisu, creme brulee, assorted cakes, crepes and ice-cream.They do serve free coffee and tea upon request. Staff were attentive and polite, especially the Indian cook Sundra.Colony can improve on its service by labelling the food and pastries. Many do not have labels including the juice counter and live kitchens. I had to keep asking the staff what they serve or cook. The restaurant has a very warm, cozy and relaxing ambience offering some privacy from other diners. I enjoyed the feel of the restaurant

Tried this Sunday brunch as our usual choice, The Fullerton was closed for a private function. Went with 2 other couples who had never experienced a Singapore Sunday Champagne brunch before. Must say that the food was lovely and the service was good but didn't feel that it was elegant enough as the restaurant seemed more like where the everyday buffet meals are served. There were no table cloths which I found quite odd for this style of brunch. It lacked the "wow" factor. The champagne served was vintage 2006 Moet either white or pink. There were also 2 cocktails of the day (Bloody Mary or Espresso Martini) both included in the price. Also on offer within the price was red or white wine. To my amazement, if I wanted some sparkling water I had to pay for it! Really? Come on, if I'm drinking sparkling water, I'm saving you vintage champagne! I was stunned. The brunch price is SD$188 p/p but then there is always ++ in Singapore so the total was SD$221 per person - ouch! Our mistake for not thinking about the plus, plus taxes, etc so can't complain. If you love seafood and raw fish, you'll like this but if you like ice cold champagne then not so much. I had to keep asking for a cold bottle as the staff walk around so much with bottles in their hands that it gets warm! I personally wouldn't go back and would take The Fullerton above this experience. Judge for yourselves......

We came for the lunch buffet on a Saturday. We had a lovely booth and the ambiance and style of the restaurant is delightful. At first I was amazed at the variety of food but as I started to try some of the food my impression started to change. The crayfish which I was very excited to see was pretty much inedible. It has obviously been frozen for quite some time. The prawns were ok and the clams were also just ok.The scallops were chewy The mussels, sushi and sashimi were lovely.I was expecting there to be some sort of roasted meat. maybe lamb, beef,ham,but no none of that. The Indian curry was just ok and the roast duck was so chewy I could not even eat it I had a lovely looking tirimisu set in a little cup but it did not taste lovely.. it was watery.Other desserts were ho hum. The chocolate pieces tasted old. So no for the $60 per person we paid I would not go back. I definitely do not think it was good value.Service was fine
4
Inconsistent service standards at the Colony. We had the buffet dinner and the service was great. But unfortunately, the service was not as fantastic during breakfast at the same venue. Tea was served without saucer and plates were not timely cleared. Fruits were not well-sliced and the seeds were not removed. This was completely opposite of the service during dinner. I suppose the breakfast staff requires a bit more training to be on par with the dinner shift. Nonetheless, great food and ambience at the newly renovated Colony
5
decorations beautiful, food fantastic, very friendly to our small daughter, excellent service, will definately come back!
3
We were a party of 7 and were looking forward to a sumptous dinner buffet at the Ritz Carlton. I have to say, the food selection and the food were really outstanding, but what really throw all of us off were the service. As we started our dinner a bit later around 8pm by 9pm several tables around us were finished, but do you think anybody would clean the dirty dishes? or even taking our old plates. Even for the tea and coffee at the end we had to wait a long time. So overall, yes good food but somehow the whole experience gets a bad aftertaste when you consider the really below 5 star service
4
I was at Colony to celebrate a friend birthday and to try the new buffet. Had a good time whist there, service staff are warm and friendly with prompt service. Food selection is good and ambiance is really nice as well. There's different type of seating, and i was seated a booth which makes it even better, more private and cosy. Went for a sunday evening buffet. The price and food wise is reasonable. Will be back for other ocassion
5
We used to dine here when it was still named Greenhouse so decided to celebrate NYE here. The restaurant has been revamped beautifully with class, food is spectacular. I love their laksa
5
This is the 2nd time i eat in this restaurant during conference in the Ritz Carlton Millenia Hotel Singapore. You can choose what you like and eat as much as you can. I love the food and the ambiance. You can choose food from many countries here and you can have a lot of delicious food from starter until dessert. I recommended you to meet with your client in this restaurant
5
Our company (a group of 15 people) decided to give The Colony a try as part of our company Christmas lunch and we never regret the choice we have made. As our company is multiracial company, the choices of cuisine they have could easily suits everyone preference. I would like to personally thank Josephine Cheong (the assistant manager) and her team for a fantastic service. They were very attentive and friendly which made our dining experience a memorable one. Thank you and we will be back in near future! =

The Ritz has recently renovated the space they use for their buffet. It is now called the Colony and has different stations- appetizers feature cured meats, cheese, salads, cold seafood and Japanese food. The Hot stations have Indian food, Wok cooked Chinese food, roast meats (their lamb chop is incredibly delicious), a chicken rice/pork char siu station, Chinese steam station, and a "make your own type of laska/soup" station. The desert station has a wide varieties of pastries and there is a fresh fruit station over by the hot food. This is now our favorite buffet in Singapore

A group of 10 of us travelled from Australia for New Year and celebrated the Vintage champagne Sunday brunch at The Colony. The newly furbished restaurant in the Ritz Carlton has achieved an intimacy and class. The buffet was exceptional - 5 different types of oyster, lobster claws, sashimi, salmon terrine to die for, beef wellington, HK roast duck, chilli crab - the list is endless and all of an amazing quality. The attentiveness of the staff ensured our champagne glasses were never under 1/2 full. My only complaint was I would have liked the champagne served slightly colder but perhaps we were drinking it too fast to cool further in the huge ice buckets.The red wine offered to 2 of the men in our group was of a very good standard. The dessert selection was of a similar standard with lovely small delicacies. We finished with the complimentary expresso martinis to cap off an amazing 4 hour lunch. We only wished we lived closer to enjoy this decadence more frequently. The Colony is doing it a class above the other Sunday brunches in Singapore that we have tried.Thank you all for an amazing start to 2016
5
What an amazing new restaurant! The reviews definitely live up to all of the hype! Had an amazing afternoon with free flow champagne! The service was tip top and very attentive! Can't wait to come back again!

Went for Christmas dinner and it was simply spectacular! The food and service was incredible I am still remnising about it. The laksa was delicious as well as the turkey and ham. Service was very attentive. They gave us a special cake for Christmas. Highly recommended!

Had an enjoyable evening for 3 on 30 December 2015. Reservations and arrival were handled smoothly.

Upon request, staff gave us new cutlery & napkins when we started on dessert.#1 THE ICE BARFresh shucked oysters, cheese, sashimi were our favorites. Tried smoked salmon too.It's overcrowded at the tiny sashimi area where guests have to queue for wasabi, soy sauce and sashimi. #2 THE GRILL & ROTISSERIEHad many many many servings of lamb ! Roast Chicken was good, beef and pork average.Had some chicken and pork from the Chinese counter too.#3 THE STEAM BASKETLaksa was good.#4 THE WOKChilli crab was good but shells were hard to break into, kitchen staff could have crack the shells more.

Had an amazing dinner for New Year's Eve. Great service and food and an awesome party with a DJ! Free flow beg package was great value. Will be back again!

We finally got to check out this much talked-about restaurant and I agree with everything positive said about. From the get-go, attention was paid to us and it never lapsed.We were warmly greeted by the hostess on arrival and before bringing us to our table, she asked if this was our first time. She then proceeded to do a quick introduction and orientation of the restaurant. This was done well as it prevented us getting lost amidst the crowded restaurant, and crowded it was for a Tuesday night.The restaurant, after renovations; was designed in a colonial setting, much like any of the restaurants in Raffles Hotel. In fact, I could hardly tell the difference between the two. The lights were dim and set just right for an intimate dinner.The 8 live stations were spaced out and did not confuse. They were grouped according to the cuisines offered and was organised. I particularly loved the fruit and juice station, although tucked away in a corner; it looked like it could do with more space. Our plates were dutifully cleared and water replenished timely. Aside from that, the service staff went about their business without intruding much. Well done, Colony! Keep up the great service and wonderful dishes

If you're a fan of buffet spreads, then the buffet dinner here will knock your socks off! It comes with 5 star service and atmosphere ( as well as a 5 star price!). We loved the revamped decor, and was warmly greeted as well as given a tour of the vast offerings of the buffet. There was an extensive range of hot food, with lots of popular local dishes as well as western ones too. We loved the dim sum selection as well as the chilli crab and Chinese duck. The cold selection included sushi, oysters, and a salad bar. The desserts section had my daughter's head in a spin with ice cream bar, lots of different cakes as well as local sweets. We had sampled quite a few buffets on this trip but this one was the best. Just remember not to eat for 2 days prior to coming here!

I've been a huge fan of the Ritz Carlton, Millenia since the late 90s. The buffets and Sunday brunches are amongst the best and I have recommended many friends. Sunday night's dinner was my third trip to the Colony since it reopened in September. It was the first time that I had to ask for my plates to be cleared - twice - as they were stacking up. The restaurant was not even half full at that point. Later in the night I got up to serve water to my own table as there was no one around. I wasn't even sitting in some quiet corner. It was the first time I've been disappointed with the service at such a fine establishment. Too bad service charge was built into the bill because I would not have tipped.On a brighter note, I still enjoyed the food. The lamb was so good and the pumpkin purée divine

I went there during for our Christmas dining on 25 Dec dinner. We truly enjoyed the Colony, my family think it’s a great revamp from the old Green House. We are really impressed with the overall dining experience, especially with the eight conservatory kitchens, which was an excellent idea. Food was superbly fresh, great variety of selections, arrangement of food, great ambience and service was excellent, in other words – One of the Best

I was very much looking forward to our dinner at the Colony having read pos reviews, pos blog posts and the online coverage but unfortunately we were disappointed.We were welcomed by a friendly staff member and shown to our table. A waiter came asking if we'd like water but no wine list was given to us and we waited for some time to ask for one.The best part of the food stations: It was great to have the freshly chucked oysters, the raw fish selection was ok and the cheese and dessert stations were the best.The other, in particular the hot food stations, were a great disappointment. For example the rotisserie (pork belly and duck) were cold with the chicken with chicken rice was ice cold (yes I know chicken rice is not served hot but certainly not stone cold either).The Asian hot food station was ok'ish, the stir fried prawns were good and the chilli crabs were the hit with most guests of being quickly emptied and it took a while to refill. The Indian section didn't present anything 'exciting'.Overall this restaurant appears to be more a family oriented restaurant not the fine dining as we've expected
5
We went there for dinner on our 3rd anniversary.The food was good but the service was even better.Especially thanks to bengkwan's service and katy who was at infront .Thank you so much for your great service to brighten our day. We will definately come back again
5
I dined here with my family one night. Also, breakfast was laid out here for all the hotel guests . All the meals I ate out here were very good . The staff is very hospitable. Breakfast had a vast spread including health foods such a gluten free breads and other Asian cuisines including dimsums and Indian food

I am thoroughly disappointed with the service received from Colony at The Ritz- Carlton, Millenia Singapore. I have had heard marvelous reviews from friends and colleagues who had dined at the restaurant, and raved about the array of food.I had persuaded my clique to favor Colony over other restaurants, citing excellent reviews, and we were looking forward to our early Christmas Dinner on the 21st December 2015. The anticipation gave way to disenchantment, and left us with a bitter aftertaste.Service:-1) A warm and sincere greeting. Use the guest's name- The greeting was substandard. We didnt feel welcomed, and were unceremoniously ushered to our table which was incorrectly assigned. We had 3 adults, but the table set was for 2 adults + 1 child. No apologies were given, and we were guided to another neighbouring table which faced a pillar. An additional chair was brought in, and given the limited space, moving in and out to grab food was a chore. 2) Anticipation and fulfillment of each guest's needs.//Always responsive to the expressed and unexpressed wishes and needs of our guests.- This is the colossal failure! Our table was located in an area where no service staff is ever present. Plates were stacked 3-4 quantity high and not cleared. Refills of water were non existent. We waved our hands frantically over several occasions for a good 15-20 minutes in hope of getting the attention of service personnel , but none came to us. My friends and i had to walk up to the service personnel to ask them politely in clearing our table. We were exasperated on the lack of service that i had to resort in calling the hotel mainline, and asked to be transferred to the restaurant, in getting someone to clear the table. And even with that, nobody came at all! We understand that it might be inadequately staffed on a weekday, but having such mediocre service was appalling. We observed the same for our neighboring table, where they had left after their meal and it was not cleared for at least an hour.3) Fond farewell. Give a warm good-bye and use the guest's name.There was none. Getting the check was another painful moment. One had to repeatedly tell the service personnel that we would like to get the check, and finally he got the message. Food:-Average at best, with some highlights in the Seafood Station ( Oysters were relatively fresh), The Patisserie and The Bakery ( Good selection, Mango & Raspberry Sorbet were superb), Indian Cuisine Station ( Props for the Butter Chicken Masala & Naan) and the Live Kueh Pati Station. The lone letdown was the Singapore Cuisine Station ( parched XO Fried Rice, Singapore Chili Crab pincers were not cracked) Judging from the experience at Colony, the Gold Standards of The Ritz Carlton seems to fizzle and feels like a mirage

Went here for dinner for a Christmas gathering. Great food and service!!! Will definitely be back again. The laksa was especially nice
5
Visited Colony for dinner on a stop over on the way back from a holiday in Australia. This meal was the best part of the entire trip. So much food to choose from, cooked fresh and was absolutely delicious. Can't wait to back again.
5
Entertained clients during my last business trip to Singapore. They did table side cocktail service with great showmanship. Will definitely go back again.

The buffet spread at Ritz Carlton used to be so much better. Went for lunch in the newly opened Colony and the spread was a bit of a letdown. The star of the cooked food station has to be the satay in my opinion. Succulent pieces of meat expertly grilled to perfection. The acclaimed lobster ball laksa to me lacks the fragrance in its soup. The fresh fruit section turns out to be one of the best. Fresh berries and juices galore! The complaint is the chilled seafood and sushi counter. With so many diners, the amount of seafood available each time is so little, they are gone before you know it. Replenishment takes a while. The prawn was probably the best item followed by the two types of clams. Alaskan crab legs were not thawed well and are dry. Desserts are also medicore. For a luxury hotel, I had expected more. Its the same letdown I experienced for their buffet dinner prior to the revamp
5
My Wife brought me there for my birthday celebration. When I stepped in, I felt like I just reached my home. The homely feeling coupled with the wide array of food makes our experience especially warming and special. Initially I thought there was only two section of food - desserts and delicatessen. Only upon exploring then did I realise there was a hidden section behind. The fruits section is a must try. The seasonal fruits provided are not fruits you will typically find in other buffets. The fruit juice counter is also good. Their sashimi and seafood are fresh and their hot stuff are good. The variety is so wide I can't finish every item. I would certain go back again with my wife

The former Greenhouse at the RCM has been renovated and rebirthed as a multi station eatery named Colony.There are different special dishes offered per each station for different days of the week...For more information please enquire or visit their page on RCM site.This new look has not only given a different colour code but has added character to the space. Nevertheless, the greenery is still abundant where necessary and the food quality has remained.Was given an opportunity to try one of their festive offerings from their bakery and found the mango log cake delicious. One can witness, with each mouhtful, the amount of work put in to fold in the caramel with coconut flakes when baking this cake. Even the delicate icing on the top was pretty
5
I had to plan my anniversary trip with my de facto partner, really wanted a buffet session for the duration. Theres so much good reviews here and so I decided to give it a try. Man it sure ended well for us. I'm honestly impressed by the standard of service here. Everything is being taken care of. Finished plates are cleared almost without me knowing. Asked for a tea recommendation from our one of a female staff ( I regret not being able to recall her name ) and she enthusiastically replied with plenty. Very knowledgable. And Tea arrived in a whole pot! Tea in pot left cold was also immediately changed with a warm one without us knowing as well! I'm amazed, impressed.Nothing negative in our experience. Foods good, helpful staffs and chefs.Definitely coming back again 
3
First time back since the renovation The restaurant looks great.The seafood selection however is not as good as it was in the past.Many other dinner buffets in Singapore have a far better seafood selection.So if seafood is your thing the Colony is not the place to be.The service staff was friendly, however not very attentive.They did not refill our water glasses or ask us if we would like to drink anything else.So for us as seafood lovers, we will not be back anytime soon and that is too bad because we used to love the Greenhouse
4
Recently visited Singapore for my birthday and was advised that I should try the Sunday brunch at the Ritz Carlton. While the restaurant itself is very stylish, clean and comfortable, the wait staff were disappointing. They lack attentiveness and I had to ask for several things which they should have provided before we even sat down. Have done better brunches for less money
4
Visited Rit-Carlton for a couple of times for Lunch/Dinner buffet and returned yesterday to try the high tea at Colony since I haven't experience it yet for the weekday buffet high tea. I must write this review to compliment one of your staff because I was impressed by the service given by Mr. "Beng Kuan". - He offered me some Jam & Butter when I was eating scone without dipping anything.- He provided me some papers to write down my meeting minutes when he noticed that I was writing on an event brochure. - Constantly refill the drinks for me and serve people with heart.Indeed he is a very thoughful & friendly guy, not only that he can read my mind but rather I can see that he is very professional and serve guests with heart.Thanks Mr Beng Kuan for the very personalised service, it's even better than the one I experience at ShangriLa Valley Wing.Improvement-----------After Mr Beng Kuan went to a break and some young guys took over, I immediately noticed that the service drop dramatically, no joke. They don't bother if you have finished your beverages, just walking around and not sure what are they doing.Even asking for bill up took 10-15 minutes while not much guests in the restaurant. Only 3-5 tables are occupied.Hope the management knows the seriousness of deploying staff without proper training.Thanks
5
While fairly new, Colony ticked all the great culinary and hospitality boxes there are to tick! Whoever thinks hotel restaurants can't serve food as good (if not better) as street food outlets should visit Colony, a great mind changer.

Went for dinner and the spread was amazing! The service was very attentive especially from Ben Kuan. Great festive menu!

Went there to dine on a Saturday night with my partner and his parents.Food was superb. The food selection offered was great. Seafood was really fresh and tasty. Salad bar, dessert, hot food, fruits, juices, soup, everything was great. Also, I need to give compliments to the architect. Love the design and decor of the new restaurant.BUT, I still have some dissatisfaction. The service was lacking, sorry to say. Once we seated down, one of the waiters came to us and offered ice water. But unfortunately, until we finished dining (we stayed for around 2.5 hours there), no one topped up our water. My partner had to go to the side counter to take water and top up for all of us. One of the waiter just watched him do this and did not say anything. Also, our empty plates were not cleared promptly. Also, I do understand that there are some foreign students doing internship at the restaurant. It is a really good initiative from your side. However, it would be better if you can put the ones with better English as front liner. One of the was having difficulties in pronouncing Chamomile Tea. Also, another one doing cashiering was not very clear in communicating with us when we wanted to make payment. I sent an email to Colony regarding my bad experience at the restaurant. However, until now, I do not get any response. It's not that I'm expecting things, but a courtesy email would be nice.Those are the things that I did not expect to get from a hotel like Ritz Carlton which is well known and prized for excellence in service. I hope that the next time I dine there, the service would be improved and I would enjoy my dining experience better

Gabriel whom we met last month at Colony (restaurant) was as usual warm and attentive to our needs at the dining table. Food was fantastic and service superb. One of my fave dining place.
5
Went with a friend to try out the colony. Saw so much advertising from bloggers and other sources. So, definitely got to try it to know it.Surprise the place was really nice and up to the standard of what the bloggers had mentioned. The ambience, decoration and the food were all wonderful. Except for the soup choice which was really limited maybe only a chinese soup was what I could find. Also, my friend who happened to try the soup, mentioned the soup was a bit tasteless.The services were good too. Really got to comment that Jenny (If I didn't remember her name wrongly), her command of english and chinese and her service are all above the standard that I had encountered in other restaurants. Really good job! Would definitely bring my other friends and my family memebrs to try it
4
I went to celebrate my anniversary with my hubby and we love the food and service there especially the cold counter in charge by Chef Lawrence and his team. The fresh seafood on ice and fresh oysters were excellent. Popiah is awesome. Definitely a must item to try as the taste is authentic. My hubby loves it so much that he had 3 servings of it. The rest of the food from other sections were also fabulous. We were really pampered by the wide selection of food choices. We left the place with a BIG BURP!Quoting from Arnold : "I'll be back!

If you are after an extraordinary culinary experience in Singapore, Colony is an absolute must! Located in the Luxurious Ritz Carlton Hotel Singapore, they feature a buffet like no other, showcasing "EIGHT CONSERVATORY KITCHENS" each adding a touch of class to their cuisine and all based on a live coking concept. These areas boast a large selection of indulgences from freshly chucked oysters and juicy prawns to the best pork belly and duck in town. Then you move on to Indian cuisine, traditional Singapore dishes including Chilli Crab. Japanese and Chinese delights are also on offer with some amazing gyoza and dumplings. Then to end the night step into the dessert bar for some crepe suzettes set a light for you and grab a bowl of some delicious ice cream.Just an absolute great restaurant and the staff are amazing, highly recommended so if you're in town don't miss out

Sunday Champagne Brunch!! Vintage MoÃ«t on demand. Never an empty glass for three and a half hours. The most extensive selection and variety of finest food you could hope for ranging from 5 varieties of oysters to meats, asian, Indian, dim sum, patisseries and exquisite desserts. At about $230 AUD a head not cheap but in three and half hours if you can't get your money's worth there's something wrong. Service was excellent and cocktails are included in the price also. Wonderful decor with a fascinating variety of historic photos and prints.

I hate to write a bad review . We stayed at this Ritz Carlton hotel for 5 days. Please keep in mind, This review only reflects the restaurant and not the hospitality of the hotel itself. We ate at the colony 4 times ( 3 breakfast 1 dinner ). Food is very good , service is horrible . I do not regularly write bad reviews, but I could not tell you who my server was during one dining experience . To get a water , coffee , silver wear , plates cleared , or even a chance to spend any extra money in the restaurant on wine or cocktails was a battle. Not sure if this is Singapore standards or just this restaurant . But was highly disappointed in service for the price of the buffet and especially the price of staying at the hotel we picked over many hotels traveling from over seas . Expect good food, don't expect good service, especially for the price of dining

We had dinner on a Monday night but everyone in The Colony was smiling and cheerful. It does chased away all the Monday blue if u having any. Food selection wise was awesome, wide spread of selection to suit everyone taste bud. But the most outstanding part is the service coupled with beautiful ambient setting. An ideal venue for any kind of special celebration. Special mentioned to our server for the night, Ken Fong. His service was impressive, me and my friends felts so pampered by his attentiveness to detail. The management does a fantastic job to have such a dedicated staff. It makes dining extremely enjoyable!

We enjoyed the food here, very fresh and tasty, the restaurant is designed very beautiful and impressive, especially the food we are very pleased, however guests who need better care,

To be honest, I am puzzled on why people here rate this restaurant as one of the best. Their website claims that their Singaporean food such as the chicken rice and chili crab are good. But I tried them and it's nothing great compared to the Singaporean restaurants that specialize in these foods.In addition , the selection is very much lacking in variety. The sashimi , sushi rolls, and dimsum were very limiting. Not much steaks either. This is a far cry from the buffets I'm accustomed to in the Philippines. go check the selection at the spirals Buffet in Sofitel Manila and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
5
We went to Colony yesterday and the dining experience is awesome! The food selection are so huge to pamper our palette. Glad to have the chefs around the live kitchens and recommend us the dishes. Thanks chef Leo and Lawrence for your finest service.Must try item: air dried beef, grilled lamb cutlet, laksa with lobster ball, chocolate souffle, chicken rice, beehoon with pig trotter.Service from Rethish and Cory are fabulous too. They checked our satisfaction constantly to ensure everything is flawless.We will be back to Colony
5
Excellent service from Ken. Perfect taste of Bandung Tea. We were there for afternoon tea. Definitely will be back there again.
5
One of the best brunches we've had and possibly one of the best in Singapore. All ingredients were incredibly fresh, seafood, fruit, juices, everything. The cooffee and patisserie is amazing, very parisian style. Food is served through different food stations where you can find whatever your choice is. A great setting and service also helps a lot, a nice round of applause for this place
4
Was there with my family after it was highly recommended by my friend. Being a sweet tooth person, I love the dessert section the most! So many varieties! The staff including the chef were all very friendly. Some even came over to have a short chat with my 3 yr old boy. When we requested for a table change as the original table was right under a air con duct and my boy was shivering, they immediately attended to our request. Thumbs up for the excellent service
4
Celebrated my husband's birthday at The Colony after hearing so much about it. Love the interior at the newly renovated restaurant and their open kitchen concept. Staffs are friendly and helpful generally except that one waiter who told me that they only serve black coffee when I asked about the complimentary tea and coffee ( I asked for coffee with milk), after clarifying with his fellow staff, he served me the milk/creamer without the coffee first, I think Ritz Carlton can do better than this. Other than this I am very pleased and happy with the service, ambience and the wide range of food selection there! Uob and dbs card holder is entitled to 10% off too:)

I would like to comment on their cold counter Chef Lawrence and his kitchen team! I was there last week for dinner with my overseas friend. The Laksa and Chicken Rice I ordered was very nice and delicious. Chef Lawrence and his team was very good at taking care of his guest. I was asked to be seated while they serve us a plate of fresh oyster due to the long queue earlier on. I then asked for the oyster to be bake instead as I don't like the rawness taste, and they actually did it for me without hesitation.Hereby, I like to give Chef Lawrence and his team two thumb up as their customer service indeed was good
5
went there last week, the food is nice especially the laksa, chef Lawrence from cold counter(hope i spell his name correctly) and his team of staff from kitchen was good and professional when comes to taking care of their guest..i was served with a place of oyster due to the long queue and waiting time..it was a wonderful experience i had there.Kudos to chef lawrance and team
4
Went there with my Friend to celebrate my advanced birthday. Love the cozy ambience and the sense of privacy comparing to the GreenHouse.The food was better and staffs are friendly.You can feel the warmth from them with professionalism. There is a friendly Chef Lawrence which was friendly and even recommend their signature dishes which was the chicken rice and abalone noodle which was really delectable.This guy from the drink section named Marcus has good memory. He can remember the drinks that we order from him! We were amaze!I will definitely be going there again with another group of friends 
5
My wife and I have just finished Sunday brunch. You couldn't ask for a better experience. Free flowing Champagne, great seafood awesome selection meats and Asian specialities. The desserts are exquisite and the service is terrific. Thanks for the exceptional service Ka

I didn't know what to expect when my friend invited me to dine at the "new greenhouse". It was a pleasant surprise. I loved the interesting layout of the live stations/ kitchen, the comfortable booths, and the general ambience. In terms of food the sashimi is nice and fresh although limited to 3 selections. I loved the cold oysters and lobster claws. The hot food favorite was the tender beef and awesome king prawns and slipper lobsters. I enjoyed the lobster bisque and Buddha jumps over the wall. For dessert I enjoyed the chendol ice cream with my favorite strawberry ice cream. Service was as expected of The Ritz Carlton - attentive and non intrusive. I've never gone for a buffet where they are as quick to replace your cutlery and clear empty plates and was pleasantly surprised by Ritz Carlton's 1st class service. My only complaint is I probably put on some weight after the buffet :) Cheers to the ladies and gentlemen of the Colony. 1st class
4
We went to celebrate a colleagues 10th work anniversary.Wonderful bright cheery ambience with natural lighting from the ceiling. Staff are polite and attentive.Nice spread of food ranging from local selection e.g. popiah, chicken rice, roast pork, dim sum etc to beef stew, mini burger. The cold selection has nice scallops, prawns, mussels, sushi, sashimi. One of the more interesting sushis is the the bbq corn sushi. There's a choice of freshly squeezed fruit juices. The desert is an interesting mix of cookies, chocolates, icecreams, cakes etc. All in a wonderful meal.Will certainly be back. Keep up the good work
5
Excellent food and ambiance. Loved the prawn, oyster and crabs here. Great buffet selection. The staff are very attentive and well trained;They are also friendly and courteous most specially to Dana, Nic, Beng Kuan, Wayne, Chef Nic and Lewis. It's a wonderful experienced. Looking forward to another dinner with you guys
5
We booked for the Colony's Sunday buffet experience for a bestie's 50th birthday based on recommendations, and what an experience this was! Firstly, the restaurant's decor is jaw-droppingly beautiful - understated, modern, luxurious - everything you want. The staff were superb - from the first welcome our group received, with a special greeting to the birthday 'girl' right through to our farewell. In particular, thanks to Amber, Gabriel and Lewis. The food was outstanding, we all agreed. So much choice, so well presented, so freshly prepared. Colony caters to every taste, and every demographic too - there were family groups, groups of friends - we couldn't fault this experience and agreed that it simply doesn't get any better
5
Thank you for everyone in Colony restaurant.. especially to Dana, Bengkuan, nick and the manager Lewis.. for making our moment a long lasting one.. food wise.. yes.. its absolutely delicious.. i am a meat person.. so when i saw the steak section.. wow! it was a mouth watering sight.. i took 3 trips to that section aside from the great cold station seafoods and sashimi station.. everything was fresh and nice..coming back soon.. i'm still craving for that steak and lamb.. hahahaha.,
5
At first I was quite dissapointed that they closed Greenhouse as I believed that it was a fine restaurant. Now that Colony is open, I stand corrected. I had breakfast here whilst staying at the hotel, and I must say that the place has the most incredible spread of food! Who knew that you could have Ice Cream for breakfast? There's even a separate station for Eggs Benedict, the first I've ever encountered in Singapore. The large variety of food choices is astounding and may be overwhelming (in the best way). The attention to detail is also a highlight, with honey still in the comb and the restaurant staff always paying attention to your needs (more tea, juice), something I didn't quite experience in its predecessor restaurant. Unlike some buffet spreads, the food here tastes incredibly good, even though there is so much on offer. There were also cape gooseberries in the fruit section, something I've never seen before in a hotel breakfast. I'm confident to say that this is the best buffet spread I've ever encountered
5
Colony is an absolute gem in Singapore! My family and I used to visit Greenhouse in the past so when they reopened as Colony after renovations, we were initially skeptical about the food quality and range. We are so pleasantly surprised to see that not only has the ambience improved, food quality (think lamb racks, lobster, freshly made zhajang noodles, etc) and service also exceeded our expectations. Special mention to the chefs who worked hard behind the scenes but outserves everytime we visit, with excellent service attitude - Chef Leo, chef Lawrence & chef Nicolas. The service staffs are also great - Tessa, Wayne & Liz. Service makes all the difference when it comes to a buffet restaurant. Thanks to all and I would strongly recommend Colony to anyone interested in having a great meal!
5
Had an amazing day - food was exceptional and the beverage choice was luxurious to say the least. Moet and Cloudy Bay all the way through! Well looked after by the tea
4
We were at Ritz Carlton for 3 days with included breakfast at the Colony restaurant. It was a fabulous experience let alone the variety of tasty food. The ambiance was good with the service and greetings from the staff. A great variety of food array spanning from different Asian counties including continental breakfast on the buffet. Most of the food is prepared then and there. The architecture is tasteful and you can really enjoy the food and the environment as well
5
Widespread buffet offers a good mix of Asian and Western food. Restaurant has been beautifully renovated. Together with the attentive service, it provides a great place for both business and casual meals.
5
My first visit at the Colony and i was sold. I want to come back here again, this time for the buffet spread. I was also pleasantly surprised by how attentive the staff were. The whole team. They were down to every detail. Chef Leo is the man. He came by our table, making sure that we enjoyed his masterpieces & his sense of humor. His fishhead curry is a must eat! Chef Leo is sincere & so down to earth, despite helming the kitchen of Colony. Lewis is another reason why i will come back. He was warm yet very professional. He & his team made sure we were well taken care of at all times, despite the fact that it was a busy Saturday night.There is a reason why it is Colony. #DiningatColonyKeep up the excellent job.

Colony is Ritz-Carlton´s newly renovated main restaurant (formerly Greenhouse). At first sight it seems a bit confusing because of many partition walls and tens of small pictures which makes the feeling scrappy. But there´s nothing else to complain about. Chef the Cuisine Mr. Leo Kee Meng has done wonderful job. The food is very, very good. You can actually watch the cooks to prepare meals in front of you. You get convinced that all the food is fresh and made from the best ingredients. The sunday brunch is probably best I´ve ever had. It´s not cheap SGD 188++ with free flow of champagne, children SGD 48++, but it´s worth it. Don´t forget to have the classic rum cocktail Daiquiri. After three hours you will realise that actually you have made a whole colonial journey throughout the Asia and it´s culinary treasures. After this observation you look at the many pictures on the walls more carefully and find the whole idea of the restaurant and it´s name Colony
5
You can't go wrong making a trip to the Colony at the Ritz. The recently revamped Sunday brunch is worth every cent, especially when it's retained all of the grandeur of the food found in the former Greenhouse, and added the best of the East and of the West, like the delicacies of both the southern and northern Indian cuisines, alongside the Straits Chinese Laksa made exquisitely Ritz with lobster balls as part of the mainstay ingredients! You will go crazy with the 5 varieties of oysters: from the St Michels to the irish offerings. Let's not forget the cold and grilled lobsters paired with snow and flower crabs. Those alongside the freshest and juiciest prawns, scallops, clams and mussels will elicit the greatest aria under the sea from you. Get to enjoy the foie gras (best of all the brunches in Singapore) paired with pinot noir or cabernet. Retish the manager tells me that there's a baseline expectation of 25 glasses of champagne (Louis roederer, white or rose) that will vie alongside your wine and cocktails for the brunch. And they're free flow. The best part about the whole experience is the excellent service provided by Ken Fong, resident server and ambassador of the top notch quality of creme de la creme service only the ritz is famed for. He delivered with the suaveness and sincerity that would make you feel like you're getting first class service on Singapore Airlines. Alongside Tessa, Gene and Katherine, Ken will make the Colony experience one of the finest, and you leaving like the Queen (or King) Bee

Went to the newly renovated colony on a Friday for dinner and it was simply superb! The food is all cooked live in front of you. The Indian cuisine was incredibly authentic and the desserts were to die for. There is such a huge variety I will be going back again as I simply couldn't try everything! The service was excellent also. Liz took care of us and was so attentive. Martin the bar tender made incredible cocktails beside our table and they were delicious. This is the best dining experience I have had in a long time
5
We had a fantastic afternoon enjoying High Tea, the tea is delicious as well as the wide variety of lovely treats. We loved the lavender and pineapple tea the most along with the scones and mini pavlovas. There was a great atmosphere, where the waiters were very polite and helpful. The China was beautiful and added to the Colony design setting, we found the process of making the tea very fascinating as it is a special and authentic way of preparing it. Overall it was a great experience, and I really do recommend it to others who want to enjoy a wonderful relaxed afternoon
5
On a recent family holiday we wanted to end our trip with a special treat and were recommended the newly refurbished Colony restaurant. Fabulous food, wonderful flavours and great choice. Kids were just as delighted as ourselves. The staff were terrific, very friendly and so good with our two boys. Special mention to Lewis who went above and beyond the call of duty to make this a truly remarkable evening. Very fond memories, a great end to our holiday

As singapore is well known for there love of brunch, there are plenty of great options to choose from around the city. As a fan of brunch myself I've been lucky to have sampled a lot of them around singapore over the years. The new and improved colony at the Ritz however is the one to go to, food, service, ambiance, wine list all exceptional, definatly worth a trip i

THe wide variety of food items offered in the menu make this place ideal when entertaining. The Ritz-CArlton did a splendid job renovating their old buffet place (Greenhouse). The laksa, cold seafood and juice bar are winners; the earl grey ice-cream is outstanding! The buffet price in this elegant setting includes tea and coffee and makes a good deal overall

The refurbished Greenhouse is so much more than it was. 7 or 8 live cooking stations and a tremendous choice and variety of excellent food.

Colony is the latest addition to the Ritz Carlton in Singapore and a place I would strongly recommend for lunch or dinner.
Fantastic selection of food for all palettes and their ice cream and desert selection is worth it alone! Not to be missed.

Went for a dinner buffet on a Thursday night. Great selection of food. One trip is not enough. The renovated restaurant has a warm ambience. Service is even better than before which is refreshing

Had a Saturday brunch with friends here. Very good quality range of Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Asian food, plus some Western dishes and an array of fruit, dessert, juices etc. Pretty much everything you could want. Staff are friendly and efficient, as you would expect from the Ritz. And its family friendly, with plenty of kids around (and all of them were incredibly well behaved!!!). Totally recommend, its well worth the price.

Visited after previous Greenhouse renovated. Expectation was high for the brand especially in Singapore.Undoubtedly the atmosphere and the latest setting for the Colony is unbeatable to the rest. However the food and service yet to improve.Setting was great in the Colony with the open kitchen concept, chef will prepare the food in front of you. Visualize increase the dining experience. Waiting time yet to improve due to some large group of patrons dining in the Colony. My colleague waited for 10 minutes for the freshly made Popiah, which is a bit rush for a lunch period as we only had limited time to dine. As a local I could say that the taste is not up to what I expected. The taste of the laksa yet to improve. Roasted pork was served in room temperature. Food presentation was perfect, but taste wise yet to improve same goes with the speed of the serving time.Service yet to improve as well

This restaurant was recently remodeled. It used to be the Green House Restaurant. My brother had been there before. You could almost get lost in this artistic, ethnic, efficiently run restaurant! You can go to eight varied buffet stations, showcasing the local foods of different countries. Many waiters and waitresses are present to help and serve you. You won't be disappointed

What an amazing place! Excellent buffet with a plethora of options. Spectacular fruits selection and equally mind-boggling desert selection! Was tempted to give five stars, but annoyed that the waiter brought everyone else's drinks but forgot mine

The newly opened which I went on day 3 of opening for breakfast. Food selections are comprehensive but same as other 5 stars hotels. Would expect more from Ritz Carlton from detail selections like gluten free bread, better selections on popular dishes and signature dishes that only can be found here. Service was prompt but could be better to reflex the lady and gentleman culture of the hotel.The highlight is the ambiance of design by famous interior designer, Toni Chi. The space was transformed into unique decor and warm atmosphere
