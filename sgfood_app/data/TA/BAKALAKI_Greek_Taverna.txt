We thoroughly enjoyed Bakalaki. The food is superb and plentiful. The problem is that I always eat too much. And the atmosphere is great - exceelent attention to detail but not stuffy - light and friendly. The perfect way to celebrate my husband's birthday.

Very good experience.. awesome food.. for vegetarians, they can consider adding on a few more mains.. calamari was disappointing. Lamb was too good.. desserts were out of the world yummy..
5
The food is nice. Although slightly more expensive, this restaurant is one of my favourite place for birthday celebration.
5
Food and the vibe of the place is amazing. Definitely try the moussaka, tyrokafteri and the zucchini chips with garlic dip. They even gave me a complimentary baklava which was a perfect way to end the meal.
5
Outstanding food, atmosphere and Sarndinian wine! Avoid the keftedes but demolish the moussaka! Pitta and tzaziki was great.

I grew up in London's Greek community so I think I know my Greek food pretty well. When I first came to Singapore in the mid-1990s there was a Greek restaurant on Bukit Timah on the same strip as Pasta Fresca. It's since closed and it wasn't bad though I can't remember it's name. After that we got Blu Kouzina further up Bukit Timah and it wasn't bad but it was too pricey in my view - perhaps because it had no competitor. It's now in Dempsey and I think it's decent but on the other hand I was really disappointed by Alati.Along comes Bakalaki, which I visited for the first time and really really enjoyed. The first nice surprise is how easy it is to get parking round the back of the restaurant. The second surprise is how big the place it. Yet when I visited the restaurant was pretty full - evenly split between Singaporeans and expats - a difficult feat for a place of this size.Some of the dishes are a little different from what I'm used to in Greek restaurants in London but nevertheless whatever we ordered - we enjoyed. Perhaps the highlight was the extremely friendly service. I'm definitely gonna go again - perhaps with a bigget group

I am not sure if my expectations were higher than they should have been, but, I didn't find the resturant lived up to all the hype.Maybe it was because of a busy weekend (Chinese New Year). Or maybe it was because I was a party of one. Or maybe the lack of genuine service. I'm just not sure as I can't officially put my finger on it.Don't get me wrong, my beer was ice cold and my Kebab was done just right. I just didn't get the welcome to our resturant feeling.Honestly, even getting the bill was a challenge and it took well over a reasonable amount of time to swipe my credit card. Ah well, I guess better luck next time
5
My family is Greek and no one cooks better than my grandmother but to find good wholesome Greek food in Singapore was surprising. I had some favourites like the zucchini fries, calamari and loukoumathes (Greek doughnuts in honey syrup). The owner, his sons and chef were all very welcoming. Thouroughly recommend visiting when you have some time

This restaurant is difficult to get a booking for and for a very good reason - quality of food and service.It is a traditional Greek menu except that the portions are large. Four of us shared a meat platter for 2. Being gluten intolerant they separated the food that I could or could not eat without even asking.The dips are better than you will get at most middle eastern or Greek restaurants.Their selection of alcohol is more than adequate and well suits this style of cooking.We also had halloumi and saganaki as an entree and these dishes were equally superb. The bottom line is if you are in Singapore and feel like a Greek meal, in a relaxed atmosphere without any compromise on the food, pay them a visit.It cost us $230 for 4 people without alcohol.At the end of the meal two of us were each given a Kavalan single malt when the owner heard that we like whisky. On the house. A great touch and good PR

Very nice place with fairly cool soothing dÃ©cor. Food was OK. We had calamari, eggplant, meatballs, pita bread and spanakopita. We then had baklava for dessert and it came with Greek yoghurt and honey which was delicious There was nothing wrong with it just wasn't amazing or fantastic. Perfectly acceptable with good service and reasonable prices
4
Went here last night and had a very delicious enjoyable dinner. For starters we had anchovies, breads, fava beans, break salad and honey feta - all very good! Chicken and beef kebab for main very nice
5
As always great food and atmosphere getting better although still prefer the old location .lamb chops to die for and wife devours the octipus
5
Food were so good!!! Was there with colleagues and couldn’t recommend the place more! Will definitely come back and bring more friends!
4
very crowded place.. indoor seats for 2 are very close, not much privacy.. lamb chop is a must to order..
4
I was invited for lunch with a friend and I had not heard of this place before. My friend ordered some great foods to share, and I was particularly impressed by the grilled octopus that was amazingly fresh and really felt like being by the mediterranean sea! We had typical greek dishes, all with pleasant presentation. We ordered white wine and had good service attention, only towards the end it seemed that the restaurant was done with its lunch shift, and it took some time to get the check and pay. The staff was at that time sleeping on the sofas indoors. We had a table outside, and it was pretty hot. It felt like being in the casual greek islands when I saw that. The nice decoration is a pluss and gives a cosy and inviting atmosphere. A place I would revisit for lunch or dinner
2
Decided to try on this place upon reading many good review. The setting is nice, however if you sit indoor it is a little noisy. We ordered Greek salad, Meat platter for sharing, octopus and a few more sides. To my disappointment nothing impress me and my husband at all. Even the free bread just don't feel right dry, fluffy and hard.The meat at the meat platter even the kebab was not fragrantly marinated and rough. We did struggle a little when eating it and eventually we give up finishing the food.Service is ok, but seems like they have hired many young ladies that somehow have no idea about their work.Price is on the high side
3
The place was so noisy we had to shout at each other to be heard. There was also a speaker playing music right above our table. It was hard to get the service staff's attention & they were efficient but distant. Food was good but the lamb chops were too salty. I might order takeaway but would not dine there again
5
Love this place, couldn't get any better! The first time i came here was through a friend's recommendation, I brought my bf here to celebrate his b'day... I hv to say, totally loved the vibe here! Love the decor, the staff was super attentive despite the place being so crowded! Dwyn was very friendly & attentive to us all the while... we came back again for a normal dinner & they never failed to impress us again w their level of service. Will totally come bck again. Make a reservation beforehand though because it's always crowded here.. but what can I say.. great places attracts crowd..
3
Had high expectations before trying, but was not very impressed by the food quality in the end. Service was good and we liked the Greek touch of offering free dessert. Seafood was tad overcooked but the cod roe spread was amazing! Definitely something different and worth a try. Desserts were good and so was the Greek coffee, if you like really strong coffee
4
The food is good; the decor is pretty but most importantly the service was impeccable despite the weekend lunch-time crowd. We didn't make advance reservation but the staff was very accommodating to search a table for the three of us. Enjoyed the experience and am already looking forward to going there again
5
We had booked for a dinner. The food was excellent and the staff was super efficient. Highly recommend this place, just take note that you would need to book a table few days in advance for a weekend seating.
5
An elegantly furnished restaurant serving authentic Greek wines and cuisine. Top notch hospitality, attentive staff and great ambience. Highly recommended!!
5
I had some amazing chicken with a seafood appo. We had great service and truly enjoyed the greek experience.
4
My recent favourite place for Greek food. Like the house bread and pita bread. Must try the grill octopus. Love the cosy setting and spacious environment.
4
i was here for dinner with my family, the food was awesome, and the staff is so kind. i love the ambiance of the restaurant. gonna be come back to this place and bring my friend :)
4
Authentic Greek atmosphere with a Mediterranean vibe & a good number of Greek/European clientele. While we were there, a group of patrons were linking arms & dancing along very spontaneously, a rat
4
Amazing food
The staff were friendly.
I asked a staff for a recommendation and he’s recommendation was great.
5
The staff were help in suggesting items and the food was great. I enjoyed observing the management interacting with their guests with attentiveness and charisma. I was a solo table but was treated in the same manner as large tables spending much more. I will most definitely bring my guests to Singapore here.
5
We visited the restaurant based on feedback on TripAdvisor and also coz we love Greek food. We ordered the calamari to start with and it was crispy, yet moist and tasty. The mains of meat platter for 2 was huge (the waiter did warn us!). It's enough to feed 3 people and also came w fries. They have the BEST Greek salad and I never thought Greek salad could ever taste like that. For someone who is not keen on feta cheese, it was divine! Super yummy! We were also given some Greek desserts and it was delightful! Overall a great experience, pleasant staff, good food and nice ambience. Suitable for large groups, date night, friends and kids. Worth a visit and we shall be back
5
One of the best Greek meals I've had in Singapore, using loads of high quality Greek produce such as the olive oil, Greek yoghurt, feta, olives, and herbs like oregano. The starters here impressed me the most. For the dips, the good people there are nice enough to let you mix them (half portion each) for a few more dollars instead of a full portion of one dish (see photo) - great if you'd like to try a little bit of everything! My favourite was the classic Tzatziki, which goes so well with the pita or on its own. The Horiatiki salad is really nice and refreshing too and comes with a generous block of feta! For mains, the classic Moussaka will not disappoint.Bakalaki is a great place to visit for any occasion! Good vibes
4
We came here for our Open-Work Rice and we felt that the ambience was really good. One of my colleagues has eaten here before but for the rest of us, it was our very first time but yet, the impression was good. Double thumbs up!
4
Truly delicious Greek cuisine and a wide selection to choose from. Our birthday girl especially liked the desert, balaclava, which was outstanding. Service was friendly and all the staff were happily recommending dishes we should try. Great evening! Highly recommended.
5
Bakalaki adds to the Singapore Greek dining scene in style. We loved the food and the service. Despite the restaurant being packed, someone was always there to attend to us. Will be back soon!
4
Celebrated a belated Xmas with some friends here. The food was delicious and the servers were friendly and helpful. Just be mindful that it's rather pricy.
4
Four of us ate lunch there. Food was good, very Mediterrean in style. Good Greek beer. I liked it overall, but found pricing to be rather high. I would go back, but can probably find better value elsewhere.
5
You can find a lot of reviews that talk about awesome food and spirit (pun intended) here. This review is about what is at the heart of the restaurant as the description says: Meraki!So the story goes like this, we had a cocktail that we didn’t like and voila it became it became complimentary. Add to it an awesome dessert that was for some reason given to us for free! Who says nice guys finish last! When you have the genuine desire to delight people, it shows in every which way. Now on the other part: we are vegetarians and very fish that we had from dips to salads to the main course was delightfully delectable and multi-sensorial gastronomic experience. If you like authenticity in food, freshness in presentation and are thrilled by the desire to be served well, visit Bakalaki.Many thanks for making my brother’s anniversary dinner awesome and times great
5
Arrived without reservation and was quickly seated.It appears to be owner operated, and service was excellent. It was a week night and the open air space was very inviting and crowded. Seating both inside and out, the bread is rustic and dense, it was great the large portion salad and spinach appetizer was fresh and savory.I had the chicken on a pita, and it was lemon and herbs and will have again.This is worth the trip and value, priced moderate with a large wine selection
5
I loved the original Blu Kouzina in Bukit Timah Road, and I missed how good it was after Dempsey one opened. Now I found in Bakalaki. Very open and cute mediterranian decoration, great atmosphere, service is great and the food is amazing. I will definitely come back
4
We visited the place on an early Tuesday evening as we know its hard to score a spot later in the week.But even on a Tuesday, it has such a buzz. Place was busy and really happening. We had the sea bream and it was fresh and well done. Complimentary yogurt was creamy and awesome. We have small appetite and will be back to try the meats
5
Went there for evening dinner.Venue is large with open plan concept, modern and funky seagul light shades.We had a bunch of starters to share - the fresh sardines were fantastic!We then shared the large meat platter which was out of this world - The portions are pretty big - we had to bring half the platter home as we couldnt finish it all!Highly recommend taking asking a waiter to help pick some nice Greek wine as they have plenty to offer! Well worth a visit
5
The Greek food here is awesome and prices are very decent & affordable :)
The meat & seafood platter are in quite big portions so would be good to share with 4-6 pax.
Really love the food here and would definitely come back again!
5
Really loved it. The atmosphere is fun, the staff are very attentive, the food is good and it won’t break the bank
4
Our second trip to Bakalaki was as good as the first. Invited friends from London. Lived up to its taste of Greece in Singapore reputation. Still love the lamb chops the best! Great organic pinot noir as well.
4
I was there for a friend’s birthday celebration and this restaurant was packed on a Monday night. Lots of expatriates there. There was a great selection of authentic Greek delights to choose from. Just ask any of the full time staff (yes, there were a few part timers that night) for recommendations if you can’t understand the menu. It is a good place to sit down and to catch up with friends
5
It's the best choice in Singapore to taste authentic Greek food and products, Mediterranean flavors made by the finest products, cooked in a traditional Greek way. Fantastic atmosphere, cosy environment and Greek warm hospitality offered by all staff!! A definite "must to go" for excellent fine dining experience!Tip: always keep some space available for the Greek traditional desserts offered...on the house!
5
I visited for lunch in a group of 12. We had lots of platters of sharing dishes, dips, pita bread, octopus, halloumi, Greek salad, grilled meats and fries. These were served to us at a steady pace so we were able to chat and enjoy a very leisurely lunch. Dessert was a selection of baklava (delicious), Greek yoghurt with honey and nuts and doughnuts-these were actually very small deep fried balls of dough with a chocolate sauce. Unfortunately they were flavorless and a bit greasy, most of them were left behind. Despite this we all left extremely full and satisfied. The restaurant is large but was very full and busy, great atmosphere
5
The ambience was good and the waiter who served us was really good. Good for couples and also family. It’s very packed so be sure to make a reservation ahead. It was our first time there and the waiter explained the food to us patiently. The food came out to be good as well. Great experience. Will definitely visit again
5
My son and I have frequented Bakalaki several times as we both enjoy Greek food very much. Each time the experience has been of the best quality for food, drink and service. Bakalaki has been presented with a very bright, fresh, lively ambience and it sets well with the overall experience. The staff are all very pleasant and service of an acceptable level.The menu is very well balanced and all dishes are traditional and enjoyabl
5
It's always a pleasure to get a bit of Greece in Singapore. The food is good. The portions are big. The atmosphere reminds me of Greece, with lovely music and typical smells. Highly recommended for dinner or lunch. My friends and I had a Greek salad, Octopus, Moussaka and Lamp Chops. Yummy
5
Arrived at Bakalaki with a colleague after hours of hard work. Both of us were starving.We ordered two appetizers, mashed eggplant and feta cheese with honey.Both were very good. The sweet feta was excellent!For main course we ordered Kalamaki Medira beef and chicken.Both dishes were very good. The dishes were big and generous and we couldn't finish it all.The staff are very nice, waiters are polite and the manager walks around and makes sure everything is ok.In addition we got a free desert - yogurt with honey. To sum it up, highly recommended
4
Chicken kebab was v tender and yummy. Love the Greek salad. Portions are fairly big so it is good for sharing. Service was v attentive. Love the lively atmosphere, which is great for a family dinner or social gathering.
4
Love the Food and the Service. There were four of us and we ordered different dishes to share.
It would have been better if complimentary parking is available.
4
Unique greek style food that I havenever tasted before.Lamb chop is the best.Greek donut is nice to try but not too much for me.Waiters are not responsive. They tend to avoid some tables(perhaps each waiter has own jurisdiction) and serve specific table more (perhaps those who ordered wine :))
5
If you're looking for a less formal team dinner setting, this is a good selection. The ambience gives a very warm, cozy and friendly feel, where colleagues could be more at ease with one another. Don't let the look of the food deceive you. The plating may not be impressive but the taste leaves a lasting impression and you'll want to come back with your friends and family. It may be a tad pricey but rest assured the quality and quantity will not disappoint you. Definitely coming back on my own
5
I went there with my friends Friday night. The table was already prepared, so we don't even need to wait at all. That was one of the good things.The food was so delicious. We really had a good time there. We will go back again for sure
5
It is good to see that just in a few months "Bakalaki" has become No 2 restaurant in Singapore.  I went there very much by chance actually. I was staying at a hotel in the Thiong Bahru area and stumbled upon this restaurant while I was strolling around. I was first attracted by its appearance - bright, bustling and vibrant place with nice decor.  It was dinner time, the restaurant was full but being alone, I tried my luck to get a table without reservation and they managed to accommodate me somehow.  The menu contains a great number of interesting appetizers and dishes which makes choosing a bit difficult. Beside the tasty appetizer "smoky eggplant with red peppers and garlic", I opted for the meat grill - "souvlaki" kebab (minced beef and lamb) which came with pita bread, some tzatziki and tomatoes with onion, and a lot of fried potatoes. The food was very well prepared, typically Greek, and was perfectly washed down with good Greek white wine.  The fast service, along with the lively ambience, the smiling and attentive waiting staff, contributed to the awesome experience at "Bakalaki".  As for the prices, I think they are reasonable for a restaurant of such caliber in Singapore.  You have to be mindful to book in advance as the restaurant is usually full. Do not hesitate and pay "Bakalaki" a visit
5
I first came here with a big group of friends (about 10 of us) on a crazy busy Friday night. Despite this, the service was wonderful and the food delicious.I therefore came back a few days ago. The booking was for 2 but about 30mins after we arrived another friend was able to join us. Despite being busy (it was a Wednesday) we managed to get a bigger table to accommodate the 3 of us. One of the waiters recommended a great bottle of red and another very politely stopped us from ordering too much food. Synopsis: Great food, great service, great atmosphere. I will be back again soon
5
Only open since May 2017, and leaping to the top of the highly competitive restaurant ratings in just a few months. Initially suspicious, I dropped in to find out how they managed, by being determined to deliver first class Greek classics to as many people as possible, in accessible surroundings, with enthusiastic and attentive staff.A spacious dining area, with tables inside and out, this place is managed and chefed, by George and Spiros, 2 genuinely passionate, experienced, Greek, food professionals, and this shows up in every aspect of the execution. Flawless food and outstanding service. My one criticism, and believe me I struggled, is it's just a little too bright in the evenings, this creates a better family atmosphere than an intimate one, but that's really depends on why you're there
5
The great cuisines of the world may be French, Italian, Chinese and Thai. Mediterranean cooking is often overlooked. But done well, it can be the most magnificent eating...simple food, fresh flavors, done perfectly. A beautifully cooked piece of fish. An exquisite lamb chop. Unfortunately, Greek food in Asia is often mediocre and badly prepared.Not so at Bakalaki. You will truly feel you are in Greece, the food is so fresh and deliciously prepared. Virtually every dish shines. And the management is as friendly as can be.Please go. Please reserve as it is usually booked up. It is worth the visit
5
Bakaliki is the new Greek kid on the block and doing a great job. You'll need to book a table because it's so popular. The food is authentic and fresh, service is pretty good and the multicultural staff know their Greek food.Portions are generous and presentation is attractive. We had grilled octopus, spanakopita, taramosalata, fried zucchini with skordalia and gavros washed down with a Sauvignon Blanc from Macedonia. Everything was delicious. The only disappointment was the skordalia which was gluggy and not garlicky enough but that didn't detract from the enjoyment of the meal.Reasonable prices for Singapore
5
This place was authentic and great - I wish only one thing. The saganaki should be fired up in front of the table OPA.
Vibe here is awesome. Will definitely go back. Great place To eat, drink, chat. Makes you feel happy.
5
Great greek food, especially love the lamb chop and halloumi! Very friendly staff and good ambience, though on the expensive side

We had dinner yesterday night in Bakalaki, with high expectations as the restaurant is still 1st on Tripadvisor for a few months.1st rank really ? it must be a joke or dummy reviews because it is not worth going there.The place is quite nice but so noisy.I requested to have a table outside in my reservation but finally the waiter gave us a table inside, just in the entrance. I was then disappointed from the start.The restaurant was full.We order an appetizer (a kind of grilled cheese – very oily and salty) and then chicken skewers and lamb&beef kebab with tomato, onions and tzatziki. The food was heavy, oily and not really tasty. Quite basic actually and I know many other places where I can get better. The wine (a Greek one) was below average.The service was a bit slow, but it didn’t matter, we were not I a hurry. But in the end, because of the noise, I was happy to leave. The place doesn’t deserve this renown. It is not fair for the other restaurants
3
This would have been a ‘4’ not a ‘3’, but I felt there needed to be some course correction in the trip advisor rating. We are trying to figure out how a pretty good Greek place ended up as number one when this tiny country is full of better food. There’s nothing wrong at bakalaki (other than an error in how they brought our food: we asked for a break between courses of appetizers because we ordered 8 appetizers and no main course and instead it was nearly all brought at once) and it has a pleasant atmosphere. The prices vary between a tad pricey to a few exorbitant items. All that said I’d definitely recommend the place with the strong caveat that you should lower expectations because it just defies understanding that it currently comes in at number 1 on trip advisor. (My husband surmises that perhaps Singapore hasn’t ever had a Greek restaurant of this type and so the ‘novelty’ has drawn a huge crowd. And there is a huge crowd - it was packed when we came at 8 on a Sunday night). Last note: the host and waiter were very warm and helpful and this review isn’t meant to fault anything including the food (the spanakopita was excellent by the way).
3
I didn't like the table we were given (one of a series of tiny semi circles, attached to the rear length of the bar so you overlooked fridges and wine coolers etc), but didn't ask to be moved. We booked in advance, and the restaurant was nearly empty, so I should have done really.We ordered a selection of starters, which were alright. The Spanakopita had a chemical taste - made me think of oven cleaner. That was disappointing as it is one of my favourite starters normally. My other half and I shared a mixed grill for one (individual mixed grill isn't on the menu, but we asked and they kindly accomodated). The lamb chop was good, but the rest was quite poor. The meat used for the chicken Gyros was poor quality, and the beef skewers were very dry. The sausage wasn't to our taste - but that's not to say that others won't like the flavour.A friendly barman brought us a complementary 'New Years buiscuit' and a small Greek Limoncello, which was a nice gesture.We were charged for the pita and tzatziki ($15) that was brought to our table when we arrived. Although we've had this a few times before, it miffed us a little, but I think that's because we were already disappointed.I really wanted to like the restaurant. The atmosphere and location was good, there was a convenient car park and it's my favourite type of food. Unfortunately, I found the service to be (mostly) blunt, the food wasn't particularly good and I don't like the design of the mini tables for two.Perhaps I was just not very lucky, and I realise I could have asked to move tables, but it just wasn't a great experience and I think I would prefer to try other restaurants than give it an other shot

My family of four patronized this new outlet of Bakalaki this week and we were very pleased with all the dishes that we ordered, especially the meat platter and the barbequed octopus. The olive oil (from their own olive orchard in Greece) was extra fragrant and outstanding in flavor. The environment was cosy. The staff were very friendly and efficient. Remember to make booking at least a week or two in advance as the restaurant is very popular and full house most of the time.
5
My hubby read about this place and after several of having to either cancel or not being able to get a reservation at this place, we were finally able to make a booking and made it there for dinner last nite. The place is rather big and was very busy given that it was a Saturday nite. I love the decor and the staff seemed really happy and friendly. As there was just the two of us, we knew we would not be able to try all the delicious sounding food on the menu but we were helped along by the waitress who was very kind to suggest half portions of certain dishes for us so that we could try as many types as possible. We ordered half portions of their Greek yoghurt and smoky eggplant dips, one set of pita bread, half of the Greek salad, the fried feta cheese and 2 of the grilled lamb chops. Everything was delicious and served very promptly. Our table was facing the bar and so we got to see the actions of the bartenders doing their thing which was interesting. They were really busy. We ordered their baklava and the nice gentleman who served us the baklava also brought along the Greek yoghurt to let us try. He said it on the house. It was a lovely gesture as he said he wanted us to try it. The combination of the baklava and the yoghurt were awesome as the one was sweet and the other not at all. We will certainly be back again soon and we will bring along family and friends as a place like this is just the perfect setting for an evening out with loved ones
2
A steady stream of people entering the restaurant at 1pm brought a wave of optimistic hope that the restaurant was indeed as good as its #1 rating on TripAdvisor. The open concept space was exceedingly refreshing, and brought a calming light breeze into the restaurant. It was not Greece, but could easily spur a moment of euphoria for the vast expanse of travelling to a foreign country. This was soon crushed when the first dish arrived. Served with a serving of eggplants and bread, the dish was neither flavourful nor in any way worth the price tag that the menu indicated. The 4 of us agreed wholeheartedly that the next dish could be a vast improvement, and that a restaurant could not be judged simply by one dish, no matter how simple it was to whip a better version of it. Imagine the subsequent feelings of disappointment when the next couple of dishes were set on the table. Homely plating notwithstanding, the dishes were either too bland or too high in sodium content. The baked cheese, beef and eggplant dish had no particular texture that was memorable, apart from the odd acidic after-taste that left a waxy film on the edge of the tongue immediately after consumption
3
Was hard to get in but we went early. Definitely not the number one restaurant in singapore by far, not even the most Greek restaurant by far. The management and owners are super nice and work very hard. If your looking for chicken white meat? Forget it there. I ordered white meat from my waiter who was asleep and he went and asked and they said yes they have white meat. The plate came and when I bit into the sandwich about a half cup of grease came out. Owner came over when I complained and said no only dark meat as it has more flavor. It’s average but the octopus was great I give them that and calamari was very tasty but chewy. I definitely would not return.

Service:Bakalaki had the best service I have experienced in a long time. I understood this the moment we received the menus. The man giving them was so incredibly happy to open out the wide menus that I just had to smile, especially when he handed me the last menu with a friendly wink. Our next waiter was very helpful, telling us the way the orders were going to arrive for maximum enjoyment. While we were leaving, the man at the front warmly shook all of our hands and thanked us for our visit, something which has never happened to me before. Atmosphere:Great ambience. It is a roomy restaurant, with enjoyable decor and a bar in the middle. Outside seating is also available. However, it is a bit loud inside, due to some music and the general din. Moreover, it was packed during our visit, so it is better to make a reservation.Desserts:Desserts are where Bakalaki exceeds expectations. The Loukoumades (doughnuts with chocolate sauce) were delicious, and with the reasonable serving size, I could not have asked for more. The Giaourti (Greek yoghurt with honey and walnuts) was also beyond expectations. However, the price of $12.90 could not be justified, for what could be very easily thrown together at home at a fraction of the price.The "Christmas Sweets" delivered to our table on the house were spectacular as well. Both of the two types had an incredible melt-in-the-mouth texture. My taste buds very much appreciated this gesture.Starters:The Patates Tiganites were tasty fries with a generous serving size, but... they were just that. Just fries. I sensed a winning combination with the cheese on the top but sadly it was highly insufficient. That was a pity, as I had to ask for tomato sauce making it feel as special as regular fast-food fries. The Zucchini Sticks (name too long to mention) were a disappointment. They were nothing but soggy, fried pieces of zucchini drenched in oil without any texture or taste. The $15.90 price was unjustified. Mains:The Bakalaki (mixed salad) had high expectations, but it failed to deliver. The dressing created an unpleasant burning sensation on the lips and the salad consisted mainly of lettuce, lacking flavour. This was doubly disappointing as it was the most expensive item we ordered, at $25.The vegetarian Moussaka recommended to us by the waiter ("off menu") was perhaps the highlight of the mains. The bechamel sauce was delicious and contributed to the all-round development of the dish. I found myself finishing every last bit of it. I highly recommend it. The Briam (oven-baked vegetables) disappointed, being extremely oily and mostly eggplant. There was not enough variety of vegetables. However, it was slightly tasty, and not too bad considering the modest serving size. The main point to note is that the Briam is the same as the vegetarian Moussaka, but without the Bechamel sauce. Thus, choose the Moussaka over the Briam

A pretty greek restaurant managed by greek managers. Good service and a copy atmosphere. Wine list is good.

Had the best experience ever here. The waitress was so friendly and acccommodating. Offered us free shots as well because we were celebrating a birthday.
5
Absolutely LOVED this place! Reminded me of our trip to Greece - food and the service was excellent!! Every dish we ordered was delightful.
5
Our second visit to the place - loved the food and hospitality of the staff. Lamb chops are to die for!!
Must visit!!

A very chilled out place. Staff were super friendly and food was beyond amazing! Really enjoyed ourselves! Definitely expected all expectations!!!! Definitely a must do again!!!!

Loved this busy and popular Greek restaurant in a lovely area in Singapore. The food was authentic and very well prepared. The kebabs were perfect. Great place for drinks and a lovely light meal. The interior is lovely
5
We were out for a family dinner and really enjoyed the evening. Every dish was well made (the lamb chops are a must do!). The staff are really friendly, they make sure there's water in your glass but also leave you with enough space to enjoy your meal. The dinner doesnt come cheap but definitely value for the food and experience. We'll be back
5
I first heard of this restaurant from a Greek friend in Athens! He had heard great reviews about it and recommended I try it out so I decided to have my birthday dinner there. I love Greece and this place takes me back there, with the great ambience, great food (food portions were big and food was fresh and cooked with love) and managers. It's a little piece of Greek haven for me to escape to! I will definitely return and I definitely recommend this to all! Only thing I would have to say it's the trainee wait staff seemed constantly confused

Most Sunday afternoon I wld happen to drive past this restaurant n would notice it is fully booked so I decided to book Xmas dinner there and we were very pleased wth the food . The waiters were very warm and smiley. The lamb chops were excellent and it went well wth our Greek salad. The grilled octopus was so succulent ! My gal opted for beef balls for entree which was great . We ate to our hearts content!
4
Heard good reviews from colleagues so decided to give it a try. My kids certainly were curious, given the last few books they read from rick riordan on Greek gods and Demigods...The food though slightly pricey, didnâ€™t disappoint...staff were very friendly. Calamari was very nice ..
5
A great location to celebrate our wedding. What a gorgeous place. Overall an excellent restaurant with super fresh and juicy food and impeccable service. Our compliments also go to the Chef. We’ll being our friends here next time
4
Excellent food, ambience and friendly service. Greek yogurt was perfect. A memorable laid back dining experience. Will be back for more!
4
Nice restaurant. Super quick and nice service. Food is very nice. If you like Greek Food I highly recommend this place in Singapore.
4
I was there for dinner and the food was authentic; wine list is also reasonable.
We will definitely go back again soon!
5
Heard so much about this place hence has to give it a go. Overall, a great dining experience. Waiter who attend to us was super amazing. Though a lil short handed as it was PH, he never fail to give the best service. Always smiling and ask how is everything. Food, no doubt, the best. Meat was tender and cooked as request. Honestly, not able to find any flaw. A must visit and will definitely return. Good Job Team!

Christmas Eve dinner with family, the decor is lovely and service was ok. Lots of junior waiting staff who clearly didn’t know what to do so small mistakes made but nothing major.The irritation was nothing on the fish menu was available as everything had sold out the days beforehand. You have to wonder how capable the management are if they can't estimate demand accurately and are therefore allowing the restaurant to open the day before Christmas with so many items unavailable! Clearly some work to do to ensure they are stocked properly to serve customers. So if you do book maybe call that day and ensure they can serve all the menu.
5
We went to Bakalaki as a group of 6 and it was a stellar experience from start to finish. We weren't sure how much to order and the waiter for our table was very knowledgeable in recommending just the right amount of food. Throughout the meal, the staff were very attentive. The food itself was wonderful, I can't wait to come back for more
5
Although not the first Greek restaurant in Singapore, Bakalaki is undoubtedly the best for my money & I say this after several visits. From the time of arrival, one is struck by the feeling the owners have transplanted some of the feel of an authentic Greek taverna into the heart of Singapore as you are greeted by a bright,buzzing well lit space full of happy diners actually enjoying themselves in this relaxed space. It is colourful and vibrant & so different from the majority of Singapore’s ‘in’ eateries. Staff are friendly and generally well informed about the menu, even if some struggle with pronunciation because this place makes no concessions to dumbing down the menu at the expense of authenticity. Appetisers and portions in general are generous to a fault - for once you get real value - so my advice is to pace yourself. Personal favourites are the keftedes, gavros & feta saganaki but the list of starters is impressive so don’t limit yourselves to these. Main courses while traditional are superbly prepared & presented wholesome food so if you are one of those who pecks at food like a bird this place isn’t for you. This is a place for those who love to eat. Not least the wine list is extensive & varied with some old favourites from Macedonia and the Pelopennese and it’s clear Greek wines have come a long way in recent years. Of course they have the inevitable Metaxa,the source of many hangovers in my youth but still an old favourite. If I had to make any criticism it would be this. To book you are referred by their site to Chope which in my experience too often tells you no availability, but when you call direct you can get a reservation and trust me,here you need a reservation! I have yet to go here and not find the place full of people revealing in this welcome addition to Singapore’s dining scene. I urge you to try it.
5
After a couple of days in Singapore and checking out the reviews we decided to visit for dinner. Decor is great and the food amazing. Portions were big and so was the hospitality we felt while having dinner. The octopus was huge and the complimentary desert completed the picture along with the traditional treats for Christmas. When in town be sure to visit.
5
Friend recommended this place to me, so I have decided to check it out.From a second we walked in, it was great customer service and very smily and friendly waiters.Great food, perfect for sharing with friends / family. Note to myself, must bring more friends so we can try more food next time
5
Great ambience, food was absolutely delicious. Go for the grilled octopus (so tender) and the grilled meats! Meal ended with a baklava, on the house!
5
Excellent venue, food, drink and the friendliest staff. Such a good ambience. So much excellent food to choose from it might take a while to order 😀😀 portions are very generous too so even the biggest appetite will be more ham happy
5
This place is great for catching up with friends or family. My fav is the lamb, the sharing platters are glorious and the dips are heaven.
5
Had dinner here with a group of friends, good friendly service, nice selection of foods & wine. Would recommend for a group couple or family.
4
Very unique for Singapore, good choice of real greek food, gets busy evening times but worth every bite ....
5
packed, noisy, big tables, all having fun and enjoying the great food. Excellent, classic Greek dishes, served in a welcoming space, definitely worth a visit.
5
I've been to a lot of Greek or Mediterranean restaurants around the world. This is one of the best, for quality of food, tast, and atmosphere. Highly recommend.
5
I booked this place after seeing the great reviews on Tripadvisor. It has a beautiful fitout that's gives a wonderful vibe, and the service was fantastic. Great food, we ordered to much and left with very full tummys!
4
We have gone with 2 families on a Saturday for lunch . It was lovely ! The food was nice ambiance was nice . I like the vibe to the place . There were enough vegetarian options as all of us were vegetarian. Service was nice . We got free baklava which was a nice surprise
5
Had a great time. Service was great and a wonderful atmosphere especially for a group of friends which we were. A relatively new restaurant with talented people taking a risk to branch out and I am sure they will make it as we will be back
5
Yummy meal with friends, sitting outdoors. We especially liked the grilled octopus, lamp chops, and backlava. The mixed grill was fine, but we would probably stick with individual dishes next time (such as the lamb chops). The portions were very large. Delightful waiter!
5
Came here a few weeks ago and it was great from beginning to end. We had pita bread, tzatziki, the eggplant dip, chicken souvlaki, vegetarian souvlaki and fries. All AMAZING! Definitely recommend
5
Beef skewers and Tara and our pick. Complimentary dessert too. Great atmosphere lots of light. Staff well above the average for SG.. well done to Mgt
5
Such great service!
Lovely atmosphere!
Delicious food!
A great place to chill out over a nice bottle of Greek wine.
Nothing more to add. I love this place.
5
Our second visit here. Food and service at the restaurant were excellent as usual. We would definitely come back again for more!
5
In my bid to find authentic grilled Greek sea bream, my wife and i decided to check out this restaurant. The restaurant live up to its good reputation by providing good customer service with a smile and passion. There was a small blooper when we ordered the Bakalaki Salad but another salad came instead...Upon realising his mistake, the bartender/waiter quickly resolved this episode professionally and with a smile by letting us enjoy the wrong salad foc and providing us with half portion of the Bakalaki salad (he was extremely thoughful as the wrong salad was huge and suggested half portion of the correct one). My wife’s order of grilled octopus was extremely tasty and really reminded us of the freshness of greek seafood when we were there. Even though my grilled sea bream could be better without the additional sauce and with extra char, this fish was the best amongst the 3 greek restaurants we have visited in Singapore. It almost tasted as good as the fish i had along the hill steps in santorini 3 year ago! This fantastic review about this restaurant wouldnt be completed without a mention of its ambience and decoration. Although the lights are bright, they are pleasing to our eyes. The turkish/greek lamps on the ceilings reminisced us of our enjoyable time in Greece. The ambience at this restaurant was also aided by its airy environment. You definitely wont break a a sweat in this kind of environment! Fantastic
5
Fantastic from start to finish. They even thanked me when we arrived for calling to say I was running late. Fantastic servers who were professional but with a caring touch! The food was delicious and so reasonably priced and were so happy we took our family who were visiting Singapore. Haven't stopped recommending to people.
1
Crowded night, great food, I go to the toilette and I see the waitress cleaning the bread basket by shaking inside the dirty bin and but the basket back in front of the kitchen! Not good. You can trow things inside the bin and empty the basket but you cannot shake the basket inside the bin where all the dirty stuff are and pull it out and reuse it without washing it
5
A highly recommended restaurant if you are searching for a unique restaurant to dine in with friends.It is my first visit to the restaurant but I’m sure will visit again soon. A very good place to hang out with couples of friends. Though is bit noisy but again that’s the spirit of a great cosy restaurant! So if you are here for a date you may consider to ask for a quiet corner or outdoor table. :-)Oh ya the food here are delicious! And the service is excellent!
5
This place is a must if you are living in Singapore or visiting. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The food is pure Greek heaven, like being on the Islands. They treat you like old friends. What more could you want. Very difficult to get the taramasalata that perfect in SG and the lamb chops - just perfect. Spanakopita =hungover yummy. Will hit the Moussaka next time and let you know
5
Really good atmosphere, really Nice taste of the food, and the Best of all very greek and authentic!!!
A restaurant we really Can recommend for everybody WHO Wants a great tasting authentic greek experience!!!
5
The food, the atmosphere, the staff- Bakalaki have got it all right. The freshness and authenticity are what make the dishes and the welcoming, genuine service are what make the experience.
5
We celebrated a birthday there. The service and hospitality were excellent. The staff were attentive and knew their stuff. The food was really good. In particular, we enjoyed the Greek yogurt for dessert.
5
One of the few restaurants to sell lamb dishes in singapore- the restaurant ambiance is fresh and clean
Foodwise generally meat based dishes was a plus and the meat was tasty and tender
Would recommend for an evening with friends
4
Food was very good and authentic.
The cost is a little high and the place is slightly inaccessible but so worth it!
5
Lovely authentic Greek restaurant with excellent ambiance. The food is excellent. Loved the meat platter and the dish ( I cant remember the name) with feta cheese together with rice cooked in tomato and capsicum. Service is delightful. The grilled octopus dish is superb. Done just right.
5
we ordered halloumi, saganaki kefalot, spanakopita, moussaka and souvlaki kebab. would highly recommend the moussaka and kebab!! we also ended off with a dessert (baklavas) that was really unique and good. Heard a lot about this place from friends and decided to try it out and their food is certainly amazing. The ambience of the restaurant is very nice as well
5
We celebrated our wedding anniversary here to transport ourselves to Greece and was not disappointed!The warm Mediterranean interiors welcomed us, and we were quickly acquainted with our bartender/server for the night. We ordered the seafood platter for two, and a bottle of Greek rose wine. Complimentary bread was served first, and it did not take long for the mains to be served. The food is as good as it looks! We are not frequent diners of Mediterranean food, and did not know what to expect. Thankfully the flavour and tastes were to our liking!We are very thankful to our bartender who served us complimentary desserts and shots for our anniversary. Unfortunately we were unable to get his name. We would like to give the highest compliments to him for the impeccable service provided. We highly recommend Bakalaki to anyone who wishes to have a different dining experience in Singapore.
4
The food here is fresh and delicious. We had 2 cheese starters, Feta Saganaki and Halloumi. Next we had Beef Casserole Moussaka and ended with Mixed Grilled Platter. Every dish was really good but what blown our mind is the Grilled Octopus! It was simply amazing! How did they get such top-class seafood in Singapore??!! Can't wait to go back again
5
Wanted to get Greek food while on holiday in Singapore. This is one of the best Greek restaurants I've ever been to! Service was friendly and fast. Food was excellent!! Would go back again. We were on our honeymoon as well and we were given complimentary champagne!
5
Excellent food and ambient.
Everything we order was delicious, never had an octopus so tender. Perfect.
The deco is beautiful, the seating very confortable, spacious.
Desserts to die for, especially the Greek yogurt with honey.
4
The lamb and octopus were special and the yoghurt and honey finish was a treat.
The gigantes weren't entirely cooked or that special.
5
Very tasteful and well made Greek food. The whole place is lovely and the service was excellent. The portions were a very good size. With 2 starters, 2 mains and a shared desert, we could not finish it all. We will certainly go again.
5
A good place to have dinner at. Great atmosphere in the restaurant. It gets quickly full of people so recommend to reserve a table if you are more than two. You can get easily a table for two without a reservation, like we did. The food was great and the service was friendly and really good. Even if there was a lot of people the service played really well
5
This place was easily the first or second best Greek restaurants in Singapore. For one thing, the food was amazing. I had the octopus and lamb chops, and the taste and quality were amazing. Although it was a little pricey, the service and atmosphere of the restaurant certainly tipped the scale over the price. This brightly colored place was full with courteous waiters, and also was nice and formal. I will definitely be coming back to Bakalaki Singapore, for all-around excellence
4
Friends suggested this place, and with good reason. The food is excellent. We shared a lot of dishes, the four of us, including tsatziki, taramasalata, pita bread, olives, moussaka, souvlaki vegetarian, saganaki, and on and on. But the absolute best part of the meal was the dessert: baklava, served with greek yogurt, honey, and walnuts. Tasting it, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. Unbelievable. I've been to Greece but never tasted baklava that good!The only downside of the dinner was the service -it was mediocre at best. Very slow, and we had to keep flagging down the waiters to get their attention. Cost: With two bottles of wine, for four people, and the baklava dessert was on the house, it cost almost $400 SGD. Not cheap but well worth it.
5
The food was amazing fresh. Doesnt taste gamey. When we first arrived, we were greeted warmly by the owner which is always a plus. The ambience was amazing as well with very beautiful decorations. We even got a dessert on the house. Very pleasant experience indeed
5
The food is truly excellent -- the dips and starters were excellent, but we ordered far too much and needed a doggie bag! Service is friendly and efficient and the space is really well decorated and has a great feel to it. We will definitively be back!
5
Saturday night spent with friends we entered a full restaurant, luckily we pre booked and were given speedy drink service and delivered some warm bread to dunk in oil and salt. We ordered Mythos Beer and starter greek classics Halloumi grilled and Saganaki. Both large servings, next we decided to share the beef yeeros. Again large portions with chips and pide bread with Tatziki on the side. We really liked the atmosphere and will return. Surprised at the end of our meal the manager gave us each a Baklava for desert
5
I went to celebrate a friend's birthday on Friday. I was surprised by how busy it was- especially considering the location.The atmosphere is lovely, the service wonderful and the food was very good. I would almost say the food was excellent but I was in the mood for horta and it was not on the menu. Other than that, flawless
5
I love the design of this restaurant. It has an open feel to it and there are different sections with different styles of seating.
The welcome and service were very good.
I really enjoyed the beef skewers and French fries.
I would come here again.
5
Enjoyed my dinner at Bakalaki. The food was interesting and good. I enjoyed the feta cheese, grilled squid and mousakka.
5
Super attentive staff. Fresh food. Everything looked appetising. Recommend that you bring a village so you can try every dish that goes by you to another table since you will want to.
5
Authentic Mediterranean cuisine with a great vibe. A little on the pricey side but for fresh ingredients and thoughtful service, what more to ask for?
5
Very friendly and cozy place to eat. The staff is welcoming, funny yet efficient and detail oriented. The 900g beef was tasty but not as good as in a proper steakhouse. But let’s not forget it’s not a steakhouse.
4
Nice place... great food, nice setting and friendly service. Not #1 in Singapore per reviews but very good
5
Celebrated my wedding anniversary here. What's really sweet was the surprise champagne for each at first and ending with dessert .... all on the house .... overall .... great food and ambience.
5
Although it's quite expensive but the quality of the food is superb!. The first thing we step in the restaurant, the atmosphere of the deco is nice & it feels like we are in Greece. Our first time, we were unsure of choosing the food. But with an attentive staff waiter by the name 'Muammar, he came to us with a recommending the menu of the food. Although he told us he's still new, but he never fails to answer of all our questions. Finally, we ordered octopus & it's nice! We will come back for sure!
4
Really cute place- love the vibe- the retail, the bar, the terrace, all cool. Food is fresh, lovely, and vibrant. Always love coming back- they have it down. Sometimes really busy- so book ahead (but for me always a good sign!) Will visit again for sure
5
We live nearby and were able to visit this Greek treasure the first week of business. It was outstanding first week and has gained strength ever since. We have taken business clients there, joined other couples and even go in solo and Every time our hopes are met. Food is fantastic the prices are in line with the quality and the service team is wonderfully refreshing with the unique Greek family feel. This team deserves their success
5
My 2nd Time here and the food has improved from the other time. Octopus remains yummy, fish was fresh, lamb slightly overdone so I might request for medium rare the next time but still tender. Complimentary yoghurt was a great treat!
5
Bakalaki was delicious! The food was incredible and the ambiance was great!! the wait staff was very nice and they gave us free dessert!
5
Nestled in hip Tiong Bahru area, this is a place to try, and it didn't disappoint.
Food was great especially the grilled meat platter, the Greek salad is not to be missed either.
Beer and wine choices were nice too.
5
Our first time at Balaki. Very impressed! Halloumi cheese starter was simply delicious. Followed by mains of filling and flavourful moussaka, and tasty chicken yiro on pita bread. Service was very good. Lovely ambience.
5
Number one on trip advisor made us skeptical but it was a real treat! Amazing food and amazing customer service! Free desert and they changed one of our greek coffee without even asking...the waitress thought it wasn’t good enough for their standard! Simply fantastic place!
4
We ate and drank and laughed, helped along with a bunch of attentive staff, delightful mouthfuls and a buzzy atmosphere. Awesome dinner.
5
My wife and i were looking for a good relaxed meal and we found this gem. The restaurant is large, modern, relaxed and has a great atmosphere that welocmes you and invites you to stay. This is the ideal place for a roup of 4 or more to eat, drink and really enjoy some good greek food in Singapore.Go to this restaurant
5
Bakalaki came highly recommended by a friend who took her daughter there for her 15 birthday celebration. We did likewise for my son. It was an exceptional meal. Every item was delicious but I particularly recommend the octopus - I have never tasted better. It was unbelievably tender and tasy. The Dakos salad was a revelation - a filling tasty salad using wheat rusks that had soaked up the dressing but remained crunchy and wonderful combined with the vegetables and feta cheese. The capers were fat and flavourful - a great acidic compliment to the rest of the salad. The baklava with yogurt, honey and walnuts were a delicious end to a memorable meal.
5
I was a bit skeptical about this restaurant's position as #1 in Singapore, but I think it might be entirely justified! We had salad with sides and meat skewers and everything was top notch. The ingredients were of the highest quality and really made the meal. The service was excellent; we were given a dessert on the house, and had a coffee exchanged (without asking) because the waiter did not think it was good enough. I've never had this happen before, and it was refreshing to see the staff take such pride in the service of the restaurant. Really exceptional :
5
I am Greek and therefore pretty critical of Greek food that isn't authentic. Bakalaki is as close to the real thing as you are going to get outside of Greece. The food is excellent and you can taste every ingredient has been imported from Greece. Excellent on all fronts including the service. We were treated really well and welcomed by George
5
Food is superb. Tasty with great service. It’s a winner! So pleased it’s in our local neighbourhood.
5
Very good Greek food, best in town ! Great wine selection along with nice Greek beer. They have done up the restaurant very well! Must try !!
4
Went with friends on Monday evening , highly recommend as one of the best Greek restaurants! Wauuu place is big , and crowded , great food very tasty , portions plenty , nice setting and atmosphere, will definitely come back
5
Visited twice with family and friends. Food is good and large portions too. Friendly staff and always a surprise dessert at the end. Highly recommend this place.
4
Best lamb chops & baklava we've had in S'pore! Loved the taramasalata (few places serve this, let alone do it well), excellent bread (which I liked way better than their pita) & quality feta, a huge slab of which topped the salad. The lemony roast potatoes that came with the lamb were very tasty. We enjoyed our choices from the large selection of interesting herbal teas & Greek liquors.The spacious room with its Grecian blue & aquamarine hues was very pleasant & there was an energising buzz on a busy weekday night. A few negatives: The smoked eggplant meze was bland. We weren't enamoured of the baked fava beans & grilled octopus but our friends enjoyed them. Our server was enthusiastic & honest enough to advise us against over-ordering so we forgave some service lapses eg. mixing up one of our orders & not taking a drinks order, although the noise level in the restaurant may have had a role to play in this.Would return for sure
4
They didn't miss a beat with the lamb, the dolmas, the kabab and the deserts .... ahhh the deserts. Given this was a big business group dinner there was a lot of sampling. The wine could have been softer for my liking. The staff kept up very well in dealing with about 20 or so of us
5
Went there last night had the best Greek food second to my Mum. The owners and Waiters and Waitress were lovely and friendly. Food was Excellent and Fantastic. I Highly Recommended a Visit when in Singapore. Next time lâ€™m in Singapore l will visit with my family and friends. I would give Bakalaki Greek Tavern 10/1
5
I was curious to try the #1 in Singapore acc to TA - the BAKALAKI.As a starter I had Zaziki, Dolmades and Pita bread. All very good.The main course Moussaka, what else. And it was very delicious. I would have liked slightly thicker potato slices, but they have been nicely juiced; therefore aging thumbs up.Even the house wine was way more than what I would expect.The Service was super! They deserve the #
5
Did not think that i would like Greek food, after finding them very salty in Greece! This is a relatively new establishment - 6 months old? Nice ambience; we had a cute semi-circular table at the bar. The waiter was very helpful. Nice house white, wonderful moussaka, and this very nice fried feta. Will definitely want to return, with friends
5
What a fabulous restaurant.....we visited on a Sunday night and it was packed, not an empty seat in the place. The waiters were fantastic, great at recommending dishes. The Greek owner was super friendly and charming, helped us with our wine order (the wine list is exclusively Greek which left me a bit flummoxed!) But of course it was the food that really stood out. We had a mix of starters; dolmades, Greek salad, tzatziki, spanakopita and gorgeous flat bread.For the mains we had the meat platter for 2 (we were a group of 4) and grilled octopus. It was all absolutely delicious. The restaurants flies ingredients, particularly fish, 3 times a week from Greece to ensure authenticity and they have very talented chefs in the kitchen.Whatever you do do not miss out on the baklava for dessert!
5
Food was wonderful - we had a constant stream of share plates which were all delicious and plenty for our table.
5
Great food, prompt service and excellent ambience. Wine is very lovely as well with mainly Greek wines on the menu.
5
Staff super friendly, really making sure you are happy
Food excellent with fine greek wine ( rare so to be noticed)
5
We walked in with my colleague and were happy about the choice we made. The staff was attentive, the food was good and affordable.
4
Upon entering the restaurant you can feel the friendly and warm atmosphere.
The service staff were great too, very helpful in recommending the food.
Food was good, generous portions and authentic too.
4
Excellent place for a buzzy atmosphere with the warmth of a neighborhood favorite. The lamb chops are succulent and the Greek salad and baklava are divine. Please book since there is no guarantee that you will get a table if you just show up.
4
Food and wine was excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. Great experience. Will be going back for sure.
5
Having been eating mainly Asian food while travelling Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore I fancied something non-Asian and so what better than a nice Greek dinner. Bakalaki's has only been open 5 months and as such the whole place is still crisp and fresh and the decor is beautiful. As well as the decor they have the lighting and seating just perfect, this place is great for a large group celebration, a business dinner or a romantic dinner date. The menu has the usual Greek dishes and I went for my favourites... I started with Pita Bread and the Melitzanosalata Dip, (wow this was superb), followed by half a Greek Salad and a Moussaka. Again both of these were freshly made with super high quality ingredients and tasted amazing. Portion sizes are generous too, you won't leave hungry I can tell you. I finished with Baklava with some Greek Yogurt to ease the sweetness a little. All washed down with a Greek Mythos Beer. Prices are about average for Singapore but the food is well worth the cost. My bill came to SG$97 (about GBÂ£57). In summary this was an excellent meal in a beautiful restaurant. The staff were all great and I spoke at length with one of the restaurants owners (Adonis) and he was just a super nice guy. I have already recommended this restaurant to a business associate who lives in Singapore and to a couple of other friends who travel to Singapore regularly. I certainly intend eating here again and Bakalaki 100% deserves to have achieved their #1 ranking on TripAdvisor in such a short time... A truly excellent meal and dining experience
4
I have been here a few times and remain impressed with the food. I really like the atmosphere here as well, there is always a buzz and when you look around the restaurant people are actually having a great time and really enjoying themselves. I give full credit to the managers here, they really know how important the customer is and will do anything to make sure the experience is a good one. They seem to know everyone in the restaurant and there is lots of chatter..I am really picky about Greek food. Probably because I am half Greek and go back every summer. The food they put out is consistently good, a main course variety of meats, fishes and chicken with all the normal Greek starters and desserts. The portions are also good, no skimping here as in some other restaurants. Every single dish they have served me so far--I have been 3 times--was good and I really have no complaints. And believe me, Greeks love to complain! Its also nice to have some Greek wines once in a while, I really enjoy the Chardonnays from Santorini.Well done boys, keep up the good work
5
I booked at Fratini la Trattoria on chope and the time slot wasn't the one I'd like so i've made a request to change my booking. Their staff made a long D call to me to notify me with the change of my booking which already got my first nice impression with their staff. So I went there and welcomed by their manager with the warmest greeting as he knew who I was as soon as I arrived. They introduced me with their signature food and it didn't upset me at all! I have been craving for greek food for way too long so maybe that's the reason why i found everything so yum! But which really got me super addictive was their "pan fried feta cheese dressed w/ honey & seasame"! this dish is too good to be true! so not sure is it bcoz' they knew we are coming all the way from Hong Kong, so they have given us some complimentary food and drinks, including the dessert "greek yoghurt w/ honey and walnuts" and two shots of complimentary desserts wine! after knowing that i am pregnant, they offered me another shot of non-alcoholic drink :) such a sweet move! the manager's wife is also expecting soon so we had a nice chat as well :) this is by far one of the best dine-out experiences i had during a vacation !! super recommended!
4
I regularly go to Bakalaki Greek Taverna and just love it. Service is great, food is tasty and I really love the ambience. It's a great place for a quick eat with friends and might even serve as a date spot.
5
A very enjoyable Sunday lunch spent at Bakalaki. The service was friendly and attentive, and the food was great. Particularly enjoyed the beef kebab and the grilled cheese coated in honey. Will definitely return!
5
Beautiful restaurant inside and out. Nice decor, space and atmosphere.
Great service! Great food! Very friendly and comfortable!👍😁 We will certainly return soon.
5
My wife and I had dinner tonight here. Delicious food and nice waiter(waiter's name Dwyn). Patient and good recommendation for first time visitors like us. We ordered eggplant, fish and dessert. Recommend to try yogurt desert. Honey and yogurt match very much.
5
A Greek treasure in Singapore the perfect combination of the art of simplicity and great taste! Authentic Mediterranean plates in a nice ambience and smily staff
5
Wow, I loved it as I walked in. The owner/operators working the floor and reception fluidly to ensure people entering and already seated are “all good”. Food amazing. My acid test is dolmades and another favs bean dish. Order the Wine Nor Cal folks, it’s good
5
Where to start;- This was our third attempt to eat here so we already knew it was popular. One friend had referred us to try- Food is amazing and reminds me when we were in Greece eating...especially something like fava (loved it)- I love lamb and the lamb here was the best I can remember in Singapore- You have to go and try!- I already need to go back and try more of the menu- Place can be busy without feeling busy as well

I've lived in Singapore for 2.5yrs and I'd have to say this is the Best food I've had on Island! We shared the Haloumi, Feta, Octopus, n Lamb dishes. All great. Not a cheap night, over $100 a head, but we had plenty to drink and were full.
4
Chance upon this new outlet and decided to give it a try....simply due to the crowd. I am totally blown away by their awesome service, special thanks to Dwyn who was always attentive and readily to smile and check on our feedback and requirements.I had too many questions but Dwyn never failed to clarify, good job! A special thanks for the surprises of drinks and birthday loukoumades I like the Horiatiki and Tzatziki which were recommended and a must try! I’ll be back soon...!

Enjoyed a family Sunday lunch, great atmosphere, made very welcome on arrival with prompt and courteous service. A good menu for a sharing meal. Wine at reasonable prices for Singapore. Very good air conditioning complemented with ceiling fans, so a very comfortable dining experience in Singapore's humidity. Not sure about parking as located on a busy corner though taxi/Uber works well with drop off in side street
5
Great time between friends, amazing food. Staff super friendly. Not my first time, definitely not my last one too!

Great restaurant.
Very authentic.
Feels like Athens.
Food is very good. Especially the meze and the seafood.
Wine list very good.
5
We all had a wonderful lunch, excellent food and service that is warmth and genuine. The atmosphere and setting was comfortable and relaxing too.
5
The Greek place where all the Greeks go - myself included!
The food is authentic, the service is warm and attentive, the decor is modern yet rustic at the same time.
The seafood platter with sea bass and beef kalamaki are must-haves.
Enjoy :)

Tasty Greek food in a very pleasant setting. Delicious olive oil. Friendly service. Complimentary dessert was a nice touch too, and the best Greek yoghurt and honey ever!
4
Go here to have a lovely talkative evening with friends and family. Very friendly hosts and what a bright shiny lively atmosphere! It makes you WANT to have a fun night. We had the house wine which was surprisingly very good. Appetizers are as expected. The filo pastry was very greasy - to the point that I had to ask the staff if it was baked or fried, as I'd never had such an oily one before. The moussaka was below average disappointingly. The lamb on the other hand was excellent. The souvlaki a bit dry. They've tried to keep the menu as authentic as possible so they didnt have any chocolatey dish (which I was craving), so when we didnt order any dessert, they gave us a greek yoghurt dish on the house - which I will admit was delightful. Overall -The place is price - so be prepared when you visit. Highly recommend it for the ambience. Food wise I still prefer Blu Kouzina

My wife and I travelled from Batam, Indonesia to celebrate our second anniversary at Bakalaki. It was our first time there and we heard of it from TripAdvisor. They did not disappoint. Let me begin...Name - I don’t have a clue what it means but I sure like the sound of it. It’s a fun name and suits the atmosphereMenu/dishes - Very tasty and plenty vegetarian options. There is plenty of wines to choose from and their dessert menus fits the style of the restaurant.Ingredients/portions - We tried plenty of the appetizers which were delivered quickly and presented well. They were all extremely tasty. We shared a main and we struggled to get through them despite our taste buds begging for just another bite.Staff/service - Prompt service and the place was completely packed. We felt well taken care of and our server went completely out of his way to make us feel special.Atmosphere/decor - The place was very jovial and everyone appeared to be having a great time as smiles were everywhere. The restaurant is well ventilated and there is outdoor seating for the people who like the heat. The seats were comfortable for dining and for the after diner coffee.Recommendations - This place is great for a large group or for two. I recommend making this a must experience
5
We did a walk in on a public holiday, and were very lucky to get a table by not making an advanced reservation. The octopus (as highly recommended) is really delicious, and we (3 of us) ordered the items below. We were seated outside so it is not so noisy (it was full house), and there are ceiling fans to draw some wind in, so we did not feel so hot due to the hot weather. The wait staff are quite observant despite the full tables. Yes, we will be back at another time to try their other dishes
5
I have been to many if not all Greek restaurants in Singapore and this one tops them all. Portion size and food quality for the money is amazing. The service is by far better than what you typically see in Singapore. Highly recommended not only in terms of Greek cuisine but also in terms of restaurants in general. Must go in Singapor
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our visit. It was Sunday lunch. Booked through a Chope reservations website. Spacious restaurant. No elbowing anybody. Menu is quite substantial and to everyone’s taste. Had tzatziki, grilled eggplant paste, grilled octopus (their signature dish!), souvlaki, and a few more Meat dishes. Have to say that even our first round of starters was already quite filling. And we were absolutely stuffed by the end! Their complimentary plate of sweets is a very nice touch.
5
Delicious food prepared from fresh ingredients. Portion size was just nice. The doughnuts were interesting and love it mixed with honey.
5
Truly an excellent restaurant! The Greek food is just as good if not better than many of the better Greek restaurants.
Service is also fantastic, not the usual slow Singapore service we experienced at many other restaurants.
We highly recommend the moussaka!
5
Food is delicious and the ambiance of the restaurant is great! Will definitely come back! The dip and the flatbread are my favourite! The octopus is outstanding!
5
Great décor and atmosphere here. Suitable for friends and family. Excellent Taramasalata and Tzatziki, the feta dip was great too. Calamari and meatballs yummy but the octopus was outstanding. Very friendly staff. Highly recommended.
5
We had a wonderful evening at this excellent restaurant which I would highly recommend. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was buzzing.
5
1st stop in Singapore really pleasantly surprised. Excellent service, real greek Hospitality, superb cuisine ‘ had some treat from the owners really appreciated; really friendly with all of the customers , highly recommended
5
The salads are the best Greek ones I tried in Singapore. The staff is very friendly and professional.
4
Almost perfect. The food and atmosphere were superb and the hosts excellent, which made the one rude bartender (I think he thought he was being friendly by making fun of one of our group’s weight, none of us thought it was funny but he didn’t get the hint) seem so bizarre. My advice: definitely go - the olive oil alone is worth it - just try to get a table out of range of the bartender with short spikey hair (the rest of the staff were wonderful)
5
Loved the atmosphere here. Stopped for lunch and sat outside.The meals were as good as we had in Mykonos and Santorini.Huge portions so be careful not to order more than 3 dishes per couple.Food is very rich - so i suggest to balance baked dishes such as moussaka, fava beans and stuffed tomato with salad dishes or you will find them too heavy in this heat.Fabulous flavours! Look forward to returning!Not cheap - but then i don't mind paying more for great ingredients. And they truly deliver. Tomatoes were sweet and olive oil delicious!Restaurant was busy so advise to book or come early
5
Just had lunch here. It’s a great restaurant but certainly not the best in Singapore. My wife ordered beef souvlaki which came in a wrap which she disliked. The waiter apologised and later offered her a free dessert... nice touch and much appreciated gesture. Nice vibe on a Saturday afternoon.
5
The ambience was perfect, food was good. Staff was friendly. My Boyfriend and I had a good dinner date that night!
4
Feel like Greek with the ambience and hosts and food. Very nice place for group dining for lunch and dinner .
5
The food is excellent, the ambience is great, and the service is awesome!
If you love Greek food, this is a definite place to try. However, do expect your wallet to get a hole.
5
In Singapore who would expect to find real, fresh, Greek food? I didn’t but I did. Bakalaki is for real, reservation required during peak times but if you go early, they open at 6pm, you may find a seat outside on the veranda as we did. The food is excellent, not overpriced like some places in Singapore, the wait staff very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and serving size. We were going to order two souvlaki but the waiter advised against it as one was enough to share he said. He was correct, at least for us he was. If you are a big eater, then maybe you can order one for yourself, but it comes with fries, pita bread, and salad so be warned. But everything was excellent and we were both happy and too full to order dessert, maybe next time we will! I am sure we will go there again, and if you are in Singapore and want to taste some Greek food, by all means, go to Bakalaki
3
Food was alright but portions were on the small side, especially when you associate Greek food with heartiness. They've taken over the place from a bar and done it up pretty nicely- but you're charged for it. We were a party of 4 and the bill came up to about $200 (though to be fair, we had a bottle of wine....but wait, no mains). Mainly expatriate clientele and moneyed
5
BAKALAKI Greek Taverna located at 3 Seng Poh Road, Tiang Bahru. This Greek restaurant is the real thing, the place looks like a restaurant straight from Greece, a beautiful, spacious restaurant. Ambushed in lots of white and light wood, ceiling fans, and romantic electrifying ceiling lights .what a Lovely ambience .The food was delicious and portion sizes good for sharing, we especially loved the Greek salad, and the Htapodi known as Grilled Octopus was a winner, and off course the mains were a stand out. Honestly this was possibly the best and most authentic Greek food in Singapore, Big plus also go to the Staff, very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Greek cuisine. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon
5
This place is such a gem with its Mediterranean warm vibe, big tables to cater for large groups, an alfresco area and heaps of delicious food! The first time we went we actually over ordered as we got eager to try many dishes; we have now reduced our order size when we go back, but for sure know our favorites! Highly recommend the spinach spanakopita and the Horiatiki salad to name a few
4
Beautiful Greek restaurant with a love warm and fun atmosphere. Food was delicious, particularly the dips, Dalmatas, and meat platter. The server looked like she was on death row, and couldn’t believe she had to waste her time taking our order..... not unusual for Singapore, but people need to know what to expect when booking. The staff kindly split our bill four ways, which was much appreciated
5
Went with the family during the week as we were around the area.In one word - superbFrom the moment you arrive the service is great, the quality of food is excellent and the ambience is great.Totally recommended and well deserve #1 restaurant in singapor
5
First of all, this restaurant is not fine dining yet it is not cheap. It is not the place to find innovative food like many Michelin restaurants. However, the quality as well as the portion of the food are perfect. The dishes are made with perfect and fresh ingredients, no palm oil added to any of the dishes, which naturally contribute to the great scent of the food. The portion of the food definitely worth the price they charge. The appetiser is large enough to serve as a main course if you have a small appetite. My favourite is the dessert Greek yogurt, they pair it up with fresh walnut and honey. Perfect combination
5
Good food, ambience was great! Their honey is really sweet and yummy! But shouldn’t order too much cheese or the meal will be too heavy!
5
The service is excellent. Food is absolutely awesome. People is nice and friendly. Will definitely visit again.
5
Took my family for visit after this was highly recommended by a friend. Absolutely delighted by the large and open layout of the restaurant as well as the high quality of food. Pricing was also about right which I guess is why the place is well patronised. Highly recommend the restaurant and I for sure will be a regular if the quality of food, ambience and reasonable pricing continue to prevail. Well done. Only downside - the skewers took a very long time to come and I nearly cancelled the order as all other food was already consumed by us. However, the quality of the Beef skewers was excellent
5
Recommended by a friend I was impressed by the beautiful airy decor and the friendly staff who greeted me and sorted out drinks. We asked for some guidance from the manager who helped assemble a selection of starters and guided on choice of main dishes. We chose the awesome octopus and succulent lamb. The food was beautifully presented and tasted superb. The wine list was extensive and we chose one of the more expensive reds which in comparison to prices encountered elsewhere were actually not too expensive. The wine was excellent. Overall we enjoyed a superb dinner and will definitely return. I suspect that the full house is indicative of a successful operation.
5
I found this place through TripAdvisor and wanted to give it a go for a while. Found a perfect opportunity when a friend of mine was visiting Singapore and wanted to try greek food. I would highly recommend making reservations, we did that using Chope as this place is super super busy. (if that isn't a testament to how good the food is, I don't know what is...) Nestled in the midst of Thiong Bahru, this place catches your eye with brilliant ambience of seeming busy and yet fun environment. I would highly recommend Halloumi - Grilled Halloumi cheese served with lemon & oregano, Saganaki Kefalotyri - Pan-fried Kefalotyri with lemon, Garides - Grilled jumbo prawn with lemon & Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Unfortunately, we weren't too hungry to try any desserts so I cant add any recommendations for that. Service: even though this place was completely packed, the service was great, one of the owners came in and asked us about the food, more so gave us Aperitif on the house. I would highly recommend this place. I am personally looking forward to visiting it again soon
5
We had been recommended this restaurant and we were super happy after our visit.We booked a week before, I recommend you do this as it gets super busy. We sat on a lovely table outside, it has a very open, airy vibe! Great decor too! They provided excellent service, especially for Singapore! I think this is probably why it is so popular! Bread to start and then mains! We had a mixture of a few things and everything was incredible, very flavoursome and quite big portions! Great for sharing! They also give complimentary dessert.A great place and lovely atmosphere! I will defo be back!
5
Husband and I currently on honeymoon trip around the world starting from Chicago, stopping in Croatia and Greece along the way, and now in Singapore before heading to Sydney. Friendliest and tastiest Greek restaurant we have ever been to. Staff and food (all flown in from Greece) were absolutely amazing. Definitely returning and recommending to all friends and family. Especially enjoyed the Greek octopus with potatoes. Finished the evening with ouzo and baklava..
4
We were told this place had only opened three months or so ago and we decided to try it out. From the moment you are near the place you notice that this one is different. Doors are open, very big space, great ambiance, everyone having a good time, very friendly and efficient staff... quite exceptional these days in Singapore. It didn't feel like we were in Singapore, rather it felt we were in Europe. Food is good but as it was our first time we tried several things and some portions are quite big, so it's best to ask what you'll get. Only thing we were confused about is we thought we'd get vegetables with one of our platters but that was not the case, a bit confusing on the menu (and the waiter confirmed it when we ordered, so he was wrong too). Other than that it was a nearly perfect evening! We will be back to try some more
5
Shared a birthday celebration at Bakalaki and it felt like we could have been in the Plaka in Athens. The food was varied, fresh and delicious. I could have spent the night eating salad and haloumi but was tempted by all the other choices. Well done the chefs, the waiting staff and all concerned and just one other thing..... don't change your tomatoe supplie
4
Every time we drive past Bakalaki, it looks crowded and lively hence we decided to give it a try. It turned out amazing!!! We were recommended some very lovely Taramosalata and Halloumi cheese as starters and a half portion of the meat platter. Everything was delicious, even the complimentary homemade yogurt at the end. Great service, great food, what more can I say
4
Love this restaurant for casual Greek food. Always busy with great atmosphere. Authentic cooking and friendly service!
5
This restaurant is rather a gem in the Singapore precinct. Once immersed in the ambience, it's rather difficult to think that you are not actually in Greece.
Greek food.
Modern Greek decor.
Great Greek music.
All in Singapore.
Amazing.
4
Great atmosphere and authentic state, but due to the popularity of this restaurant, services was a bit slow. It is great for friends gathering and casual business hangouts.
5
Outstanding Greek food in a relaxed setting - I can't wait to go back. In fact, I think that this is now the best Greek Restaurant in Singapore - AND - there is a large parking lot right behind the restaurant!!!
5
Very comfy restaurant with fantastic food and friendly service staff. Great for intimate gatherings without the loud buzz of hyped up restaurants. Will definitely go back again soon!
5
Remarkable ambiance and excellent service coupled with fair prices!
We did not expect the little extras that they have prepared for us when they learnt that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.
We had a wonderful experience and will definitely be going back for more.
5
Visited Bakalaki again for the second time and have to say just as good as the first time, only real difference was the word must be out - there wasn’t a spare seat. Even with a full restaurant the service was great, food was consistently good and the atmosphere was awesome. Sure there was small things I personally would have liked different but that was not the consensus of the table so it must just be me. The staff make you feel so welcomed nothing was too hard - made me feel like I was at my friends house for dinner. It’s like all the staff were sent to live with a Greek family for training
4
It was my second time here for a visit, simply because i really wanted to try other things on the menu since the first time was so good! Previously i had the kefalotyri, spanakopita and gemista, and the greek yoghurt with walnuts and honey. They were all authentic and reminded me of the time i went to santorini. Especially the creamy dessert.This visit i tried the halloumi (real ones!), greek salad which was super fresh, fried calamari, and cod fish. And also my favourite greek coffee. All were great dishes, i have no complaints. My friends and i enjoyed the nice ambience, perfect for weekend brunch with the open concept decor, i like it that they sell greek produce as well. Overall, it has become my favourite greek place to hang out
5
Loved the smoky eggplant dip and grilled octopus, which came in a very generous portion. Some potatoes would have been perfect with it :) Service was wonderful thought it can get a little slow, but to be fair they were having a very busy night. Newer staff (who aren't allowed to take orders yet) are lovely and attentive. The place can get noisy, so I'd recommend a table outside if it's going to be a cool night. Dinner ended with some Greek limoncello, on the house. Twice. And that sealed the deal — see you again soon, Bakalaki
5
We went to celebrate a birthday dinner & came out totally impressed. The restaurant is big, airy & well lit. The decor of wine barrels, wine bottles & food items adds character to the place. The service is relaxed & friendly, but efficient.We ordered grilled octopus, grilled lamb chops, puts with Greek meatballs, Greek baklava, doughnuts, Greek lager and ouzo. Everything was delicious. The grilled octopus is a must try & so is Ouzo. The lamb was perfectly cooked. The desserts were good & portions generous. We would love to return
4
Ambience was lively on a weekday. The food was amazingly authentic. The skewers were especially nice!
4
Food was great. The bill was not. $180 for a 2 person lunch is a lot, even for Singapore. Other than that, the staff was courteous, the food was delicious and we had a great time!
5
This was the first time we have Greek food it also was my son birthday dinner. The food portion is big if you are small eater better share with someone. We will definite visit again and introduce to friends.
5
Friendly staff and pleasant ambience. Food was absolutely delicious and you can taste how fresh the ingredients are.
5
Lunch with customers one day and dinner by myself the next. Both times the service and food was amazing while the atmosphere was completely relaxing!!!
5
LOVED the pan-fried feta cheese starter and the grilled octopus. Food was fresh and perfect. Thanks also to the team for preparing a birthday surprise for my boyfriend; we were so full and happy after lunch we barely had space for it! Would love to go back to try more dishes
3
As promised in my review on my disappointing first visit to Balakaki for seafood, I returned to try out their meats for a change since that was what I saw most diners had on their tables then. Ordered a mixed grill for one but the portion was actually good enough for two. However , taste, presentation and texture wise, it was at best average. The friendly waitress recommended the grilled octopus and I couldn't help telling her how terrible the octopus was during my first visit. Since she promised that it would be good this time around, I accepted her recommendation. All I can say is that it was edible and we finished the octopus on the plate. Was it as wonderful as what was mentioned in most posted reviews? I would not hesitate to maintain a big "NO". It was a far, far cry from what I had in Santorini, Greece. Anyway, being disappointed twice is enough for me, this will definitely be my last visit to Balakaki.
4
Restaurant has lovely decor with good ambience.Food is very good. Had the 3-dips with pita bread. Loved the dip with cod roe - excellent.Also excellent was the octopus tentacle - great taste and texture.The moussaka was good but had to wait a while for it.Lamb chops were average. Dough balls with chocolate sauce was chewy and delicious.The service was a tad slow albeit friendl
5
Went here with a group of friends and what an evening...The setting is fantastic with wide open spaces, great atmosphere and a nice buzz.The food, from starters to the sharing platters as mains and the deserts which I usually don't have myself, was amazing. We got food and drink recommendations from the staff which were all perfect and two of the managers remembered me from a previous place they worked at even though I rarely saw them and only years ago.With the sharing platters, the evening was very reasonably priced. You cannot go wrong by visiting this place
5
Fresh ingredients, perfect spices, hot to the table, we loved our waiter and the manager came over and was delightful! We ordered the grape leaves as an appetizer and tzatziki with pita bread. For the main moussaka and ground lamb and beef kabob. We enjoyed this meal so, so much!! We honestly can't remember when we just kept eating because everything was so tasty.. And we were delighted to sit outside, it felt more Greek. We are in Singapore for two nights and we've decided to go again tomorrow. We also had plenty as take away!
5
Went at the weekend and was very busy so service a little slow but the food more then made up for it, must try is the Yoghurt and Honey desert.
5
One of the best Greek restaurants outside of Greece. Food like your Greek mother would make! Make sure you leave room for coffee and desert
5
Friends and I was here for a dinner for a special occasion. We wanted to try all 5 dips however know the portion could be too much if we order all.. Server was nice to provide a recommendation of all 5 dips with a smaller portion. Even so! Eventually turn out to be dips turn out too much much more than feeding 4 of us... hence recommendation for all if you like to try all 5 dips, have more folks like 6 people :) with dips, 4 of us were extremely full, and had gone light on the mains. Food is good, ambience is nice. Reasonably priced ! Well worth a visi
4
Newly opened restaurant, when I visited with a friend. Tasty Greek food, no doubt, but a bit on the high side for pricing for the quantity. Was obviously popular, since the place filled up by around 7pm. Would come back as it was a nice restaurant with an open airy feel. Good place for get-together with a group of friends
5
Come to bakalaki singapore, you won't regret it. Fresh flown seafood, top quality ingredients and staff and chef that know what they are doing.I recommend the meat platter, the dips, the Greek wine! Everything is delicious and the service is great. Don't forget to try the baklava or loukomades at the end of your meal.Keep up the good work, guys
5
Really love this restaurant for its fabulous Greek food, excellent attentive service, great ambiance and location. We were there early on a Tuesday night and it was buzzing. All the food we had was fabulous but my special favourite is feta cheese in honey and sesame - it's truly divine. Highly recommended.
5
We came down for a dinner on a cosy Tuesday evening. We casually walked in. The place was full. (I recommend you to book a table)We were lucky and got a table outside. We have ordered dips with pure bread as starters. We chose the smaller portions. Despite of these being small we all had our fair share of starters. We ordered kebabs and loukoumades. The portions were fantastic. I was really full with all he nice food.We have chatted a bit with one of the gentlemen running the place. Btw the dessert was also amazing !!!It's a nice place to try !!
3
We came here for lunch to celebrate our son's 21st birthday. When I called one night, close to closing time to make reservation I was told they do not open for lunch on that Saturday. Then our friend surprised us by successfully making the reservation without any issues. Our first impression was it was an exclusive restaurant but by the end of the meal we did not find it outstanding or different from any others, except for the decor. Food was good and prepared with love and just nicely cooked. The ceiling aircon dripped water a few times(probably due to the condensation) and after we brought to the staff attention they quickly moved us to another table and substituted the dish that had the droplets trickled into. Portions were good for 2 to 3 to share. But the simplicity of the food in my view did not command the price. At the end of the meal we were surprised by the restaurant that they provided us with a complimentary dessert. Staff were very helpful and alert and food was served timely while hot. Not sure why we were told the restaurant is always full with a crowd waiting for tables yet it was not anywhere near full capacity nor busy
5
Order Keftedes as starters, its fried till golden brown the husk of the meatball yet juicy and tender in the inside. Tried it with the mint sauce. Its very good. As for the mains, we had Kotopoulo Hilopites Yiouvetsi, squared pasta with chicken chunks. This dish kinda disappointing, portion of pasta is 3/4 to chicken chunks. The amount of pasta drowned the appetite away. However the chicken chunks are tender and flavourful. We had Moussaka too, its wonderful. A definite must try. Sadly, my party of 2 had rather small appetite, we didn't manage to order more. We will definitely return for their skewers and others. They offered us complimentary dessert, Baklava. I was too stuffed to enjoy it sadly.
5
Visited for dinner with a group of friends on a busy Saturday night (reserved in advance) and had the best dining experience in a very long time. The food is exceptional and the wine recommended to us by the waitress went down very well. We started with a selection of dips, breads, dolma, hallumi and salads, octopus and then shared a couple of meat platters. The servings are very generous but we persevered and finished with baklava and donuts for desert. Every single dish was a hit, and the few dishes we didn't order we will be sure to try next time we visit. The atmosphere was fun and casual with authentic Greek influence apparent in the decor, music and service. I was not surprised to see that every table was full, I would strongly advise booking in advance to avoid missing out
4
Great environment with pretty cool service, grilled cheese was really good and portion of the mains is hearty!
4
We went there because we like the decoration of the place when we looked at pictures. Very charming, good service and the food was delicious. We will be returning with friends!
5
The staff see you coming before you enter, and your greeted with the same warmth as you would entering someone's home. Every dish was a moreishly mouthwatering delight.. I'm just sad we couldn't have everything on the menu, but it's good to have goals.
4
We ordered a greek yogurt, a greek salad and a beef skewer. Foods taste great, though me and my partner both found the foods a bit too salty. Greek salad portion was huge, and the tomatoes in the salad were especially sweet and juicy!!!
5
Authentic Greek food for reasonable price. One of the best kebab I had in Singapore so far and the Baklava is to die for.
5
As a Greek who's grown up with his mother's and mother's-n'law plates I can tell you this is awesome Greek food, made by Greeks with Greek recipes & ingredients! The relaxed ambience, the friendly people, the Greek music and the professional service complete a superb experience! Highly recommended by the Greeks
5
Love love love their decor, it's so spacious, bright yet private for your group so that you can chatter away happily. Food's amazing - moussaka and slouvakis are good. Recommend to get their yogurt with cucumber as a starter dip for your breads :) however wouldn't recommend the loumades donuts though. They don't taste like the ones I've had in Greece (perhaps different types) but even on its own we also don't like the taste. They have a wide variety of Greek wines and the bartender was really nice to provide some free raki for us as my friend was celebrating her 30th birthday. Excellent service by the staff. Would not hesitate to recommend this beautiful place!
5
Tucked away from the main road, we decided to try BAKALAKI as we had only tried 2 other Greek restaurants in Singapore after living here for a few years. So glad we found this place, due to the fact we could see the chefs (both Greek and non-Greek) in the kitchen, the open space and the friendly greeting we had upon arrival.To start, we ordered Zucchini sticks, which came in a small metal basket, garlic dip and the sticks looked like chips - a delightful way to start the meal.For our mains, we ordered Lamb Chops (Paidakia) and Chicken Skewers (Souvlaki). Not only were the lamb chops aromatic but also marinated thoroughly. The Paidakia came with a side of potato wedges and a cut lemon for flavouring.The same can be said of the Souvlaki, with shredded onions, tomato and a cut lemon (for flavouring once again). We had the option of a wrap for the Souvlaki but opted for the skewers as it was easier to share.By the end of the meal, we were simply too full for dessert however we both agreed we would return to try their other dishes
5
Located near Tiong Bahru market, Bakalaki is a bit hard to access. However, when we visited on a Sunday for an early lunch before noon, the place soon filled up very quickly. I am a bit clueless when it comes to Greek food, but a friendly staff helped us out and suggested what we should order. Since it was our first time, we took his advise and ordered the Greek salad, moussaka and spanakopita, with Greek beer, all as per recommendation. All dishes were delicious. We loved the salad which was simple with a generous slab of cheese, pairing well with the fresh vegetables and the olive oil. Although we opted for the small size instead of the regular size, it was still a good portion. The moussaka was rich and the spanakopita was crisp with a creamy filling. I felt that the olive oil they use is extremely high quality with a rich fragrance. Our lunch ended with their signature dessert, Greek yoghurt with walnuts and honey. The yogurt was much thicker than the ones you can buy off the shelf, almost like clotted cream. We will definitely go back again to try the other dishes....we are in love with Greek food
4
First time in this restaurant recommandes by Greek friend. Advice : book in advance. Good points :- good taste- excellent starters, large portions to share. 2 for for us good enough. - the moussaka is amazing. - nice staff, good service- nice design of the space- price (not cheap but good portions) Bad points : - acoustic of the restauran
5
if you like traditional Greek food this new establishment at Tiong Bahru is a must. Think this will be a lot a peoples regular.
5
New Greek restaurant on the block. Service and food rivals best in the city. Every dish for appetizers to mains was tasty and fresh. Service was impeccable, although one of our items came in late the staff was extremely apologetic and gave us free dessert.

Nice ambience and food comes in generous portions. Great for group gatherings so u can try a variety of dishes. Although the kebab is a bit disappointing as it came out a bit dry
5
Amazing food quality, excellent staff who know the menu and make honest food and quantity recommendations. My family background is Greek so am pretty picky with Greek food and Bakalaki is YUM - Must try!!
5
Staff was extremely helpful and even recommended downsizing the size of our platter to avoid over-ordering food for the number of people at our table. Music at the restaurant could be played a little softer in order to make conversation easier :)

What a great new place - food was excellent and there were so many exciting choices - we loved everything we ordered. The decor and ambience were a big part of the experience - vibrant and engaging. Last but not least - the service was great, servers generally caring and passionate about the place. Thank you so much for this experience

I went for Sunday lunch, and was very positively surprised to find this Neighbourhood gem. The first thing that stands out is the open, clean-cut Mediterranean decor, with a spacious indoors and cute outdoor patio. The place was absolutely full and buzzing, so I took a seat at the Counter, with a view of the kitchen. Ate fava beans, pita bread, moussaka and honey yoghurt (the last kindly delivered on the house). Each dish was home-style and tasty. Service was friendly, with more zest than typical in Singapore, and the managers were very much part of the action. I left happy. All round, a great addition to the dining scene, and well worth checking out.

Having lunch at Bakalaki back to back with a top Greek restaurant consecutively, not by design but mere coincidence, elicited exciting prospects of determining which of the two was a better restaurant given the accolades heaped on both of them!At the recommendation of the waiter, we ordered a bottle of Greek Syrah, which was a nice youngish and full bodied red.We then started off with 3 starters all of which were served with dips together with pita bread. We had the cucumber yogurt, fish roe and egg plant dips. The dips were well prepared and delicious but the pita bread although good, could have been a bit more fluff and soft.The Sourdough bread was very delicious especially when dipped in olive oil, the latter of which appeared to be of high quality full strength extra virgin oil.Our mains consisted of the grilled mixed seafood platter as well as the mandatory grilled lamb cutlets.The seafood platter came with some fried calamari, 2 tentacles of grilled octopus, a smallish looking grilled fish of either bream or snapper and 2 mid sized grilled prawns. The serving of lamb was 3 pieces of rather plumb cutlets.The highlights of the mains have to be the octopus and prawns dollowd by the lamb and fish.Both octopus and prawns were very well grilled with just the right touch of charred character. Although the prawns were slightly less juicy/succulent but the octopus was well beaten during preparation and consequently the texture was nicely tender to the bite! The fish was fresh and its flesh juicy. The accompanying fish sauce which was served separately in a small bottle blended with flavours of the fish beautifully.The lamb was nicely grilled and delicious too.Our expectations were set very high when we ordered the baklavas as the ones served in the other Greek restaurant did a fabulous job on their version of the same dessert.In Bakalaki, the baklavas were served in the shape of a triangle and bigger in size while in the other restaurant it was made in the shape of a roll and smaller in size.I must say the baklavas in Bakalaki were the outright winner in the contest, more character and flavours and a total delight to wash it down with a nice strong latte.On the subject of latte, it was served with one shot of espresso in a slightly bigger cup than the normal latte glass and hence rendered the coffee a tinge weak, which was promptly rectified by the waitress. The coffee beans were from Illy and they find favour with my palate.The Greek manager was very pleasant and friendly and somehow concluded that my waist was not sufficiently rounded, albeit I may differ, and presented us with a serving of freshly cooked Greek donuts on the house! A nice touch but please be assured it did not have any bearing on my opinion of the food of the restaurant!So in the final analysis, which of the 2 accomplished Greek restaurants took the gong? They were slightly different in terms of how the food were prepared served and tasted, but they were both equal and deserving winners! But Bakalaki's prices were more palatable!The only grouse I had was that the music was abit loud which made for difficult conversation although this may have been deliberate to drown out the noise from the roadworks directly across the road.Recommended..Food: 5/5

Recently opened, the Greek taverna of Bakalaki is bringing a Mediterranean breeze in Tiong Bahru!We loved the relaxed vibe, yet with extremely attentive service and some of the owners looking after each and every details to make sure patrons were having a great time. The food was overall delicious, and the portions : so huge! we couldn't finish as we might have gotten a bit excited at all this deliciousness and needed to tapau. Looking forward to go back, and maybe pick some of the olivie oil and other deli products from Greece to bring back home
5
This restaurant is a MUST GO one ! The quality of the ingredients is excellent, the food amazing ! The staff is very dedicated to you and want to please you constantly and make your meal experience fabulous. As a French, I am demanding regarding the food and honestly I was totally impressed and dazzled by our dinner ! Last but not least, the design and the decoration are really nice and creative. We got a fabulous time there !!! I will go again and again !!!
5
I had high expectations going in and I was not disappointed. The dips, moussaka and the dessert were all spot on.
Good ambience and great food!! Will definitely be going back soon
5
The ambience of this restaurant will make you feel like you're on holiday. The staffs were very warm and welcoming. Foods taste great with descent portion. Highly recommended!
4
delightful service, though they were short handed because it was full house that evening. Sharing platters were sufficient for our group. Going back this weekend!
5
The dinner is a celebration for my friend's birthday. We get seated shortly after we arrived. Although the price is a bit high, all the food tastes fresh and yummy. I like the sweetness of tomato in the greek salad. It is a sweet touch for the chef to prepare a complimentary baklava for the birthday celebration
5
Superb ingredients with the look and feel of a holiday in Greece. Service was friendly and professional and meal portion sizes were generous. We also liked the Greek yogurt and honey sold in the retail section of the restaurant. Items were expensive ie. $19 for a 1kg tub of yogurt but the yogurt was thick, exceptionally creamy and fresh. The honey was fragrant, light and luscious in texture. Been back twice last week
5
I love everything about Bakalaki. Let's start with the decor: it's like you're on a Greek island, you can imagine the sea just outside, Greek music in the background, seagulls above your head (the lampshades are actually shaped as seagulls). Then comes the welcome, the staff - they are just here to make you feel home. And the food... what can I say... the food... the moussaka alone could make go back (weekly at this stage). But think of the tzatziki or the grilled chicken with the lemon marinade or any of the grilled meats or the to-die-for feta straight from Greece and food is just heaven! I shouldn't bring everyone there and should keep this a secret, but I just can't. When it's that good, you have to share :
5
First time dining at this restaurant opened and I was blown away by the setting and decor. Excellent job. The manager was extremely hospitable and we were seated outside as a larger group.We ordered a meze selection, moussaka, octopus, yemista and a few other light dishes which were good. Yemista a bit bland, maybe needs some more herbs and/or oil, and unfortunately the octopus which is often the highlight was a bit mushy.Good wine selection, generous and rich desserts and well recommended
5
We came for lunch, the decor of the restaurant is very inviting. The light colours and comfortable seats was just perfect. We walked around the restaurant all the staff were very friendly and they have the open kitchen which is very clean and all the chef greeted and smiled at us. Now the most important part, we ordered the dips, Greek salad, meatballs, chicken skewers. All the food was beyond our expectation and the flavour was excellent. All the dishes has their own uniqueness and perfectly seasoned. This a restaurant must try. Pricing is good as well. Will definitely come back. Well done.
5
Best Greek restaurant I have ever eaten! The food and the atmosphere are perfect. The restaurant brings a touch of the Mediterranean and the food could not be more fresh. From the starters to the meat and the fish, we loved everything we ordered. The service is efficient and attentive. Highly recommend this amazing restaurant!
5
This new greek taverna has an al fresco area oitside facing a road so we wer happy to sit inside in the large open area, white and airy restaurant. The food was delicious and they have a small shop area for greek food items for purchase.Server system made service a bit complicated as only some few wait staff were allowed to receive orders, the others just served or cleared tables, but all very friendly
5
Awesome vide, bustling, and energetic. The Service staff are all great. The food is excellent. Only regret is we should have gone with a larger party so we could taste more dishes from the menu.
Will go back with a big table.
5
Enjoyed our family visit to Bakalaki. Kids just got off plane and were famished for some wholesome food. Great hosts and fresh quality food.
5
Fabulous, authentic Greek food in a gorgeous restaurant. Loved everything, especially the courgette sticks and the salads. Highly recommend it and you get great service!
5
A great cosy place to spend a lovely evening with friends or family. Can't say enough about the excellent service provided!
5
We had a very good experience on saturday with BAKALAKI. We were so happy to see Blue's team again leading the way to a fantastic lunch, and a fantastic experience overall.. The restaurant is lovely, they did a wonderful job decorating it. And the food - as remembered - delicious. I wish them all the luck in this new venture. We will sure be back.
5
Finally another option for Greek food in Singapore. The food is tasty and fresh, the service is very good and the restaurant space has been fitted out to create a really nice atmosphere. For a big open space it is a lot less noisy than you would expect. Perfect for families or groups of friends or even a dinner date! Well worth a visit
4
The place is very nicely decorated. It makes you like you are in Greece. The staff are warm n friendly. Food is authentic n taste great. There is a little corner where you can buy some Greek food stuff like oregano, capers, olives n oil. Overall great experience n visited the place twice in a month.
5
The restaurant is wide and open, the design and deco very nice.Special stars for the staff: knowledgeable, listening to you, able to adapt, to advice, making the experience a great one. The menu gives you a large selection of the Greek dishes, the food is very good, nicely presented
5
It's always a pleasure to have a meal Bakalaki. Only having opened a few weeks ago, they already have a stream of loyal customers coming back. The food is altogether excellent as is the service. Their wine list is not extensive, but what they do have is a decent range of very good Greek wines.Christos and George makes the meal all the more memorable. Will definitely be back!
5
This is my second visit in a month, I love the cosy venue, the good food and the friendly service especially to the girl with glasses (sorry don't know her name). The food portion is generous and mostly can be shared. On top of that, there's a complimentary sweet surprised at the end their fried doughnut with honey & chocolate... Yummy!!Highly recommended but advise to book in advance. Even thought they are new but they are getting busier already.Thank You Bakalaki for your hospitality
5
Me and my family went to Bakalaki to find great greek food and we found it. The service is very nice. Our favourite plate was the lamb as it was cooked to perfection
4
Warm, bright, casual atmosphere, attentive service, succulent, delicious meats and fresh Greek salads. Nice.
Seafood was a little disappointing.
3
Nice new restaurant in Tiong Bahru. The only downside is that it is pricey. Good attentive and helpful staff.
5
Excellent food quality, awesome service by the crew. Great place to hang out with friends over good food and wine.
5
The whole concept is very well thought of, decor, bar, menu, the gourmet corner. Cocktails are delicious and food is authentic, topped that with the warm atmosphere. We will come back.
5
A friend of mine had told me about Bakalaki and being Greek, I had to try it out. We had the octopus, kalamari and the gemista. The octopus was fantastic! It may be the best octopus I have had and it was plentiful. the kalamari (squid) was standard fare and the gemista were nice (only I wish they contained some pine nuts and raisins). The decor of the place is one of the best features, and it shows that a lot of love went into creating a nice sensation for the customers. I will definitely be back and will definitely have the octopus again
4
Chanced upon this restaurant during our staycation in Tiong Bahru. Lovely ambience n quite a crowd on a Saturday night. Since we were new to Greek food we went with the suggestions made by the server n we were not disappointed. We had the grilled octopus n grilled lambs w/baked potatoes. Both were good to the last morsel. I had a bottle of Greek beer to wash down the dinner. We tried the baklava for desert but we found too sweet for our tastebuds. Overall a very nice dining experience.

Was looking forward to an authentic Greek dinner at Bakalaki in view of the high ratings given. The newly renovated premises were brightly lit with a tasteful dÃ©cor. Waiting staff was super friendly and helpful. We have beef meatballs and tomato patties for entree. The beef balls were tasty but a little on the dry side. The tomato patties were probably a little burnt and overly saltish. We loved Greek grilled prawns and octopus while we were holidaying in Santorini, so ordered the same. Obviously, the Singapore prices were much higher and there's only one grilled prawn on the dish. Deliciously grilled but can't be called a giant prawn at all. Something must also have gone wrong with the grilled octopus. It was tough, chewy, rubbery, tasteless and can't really be swallowed. The wife and me agreed that it is among the worst dish we have ever tried. Asked the waiting staff to take the dish back after we have taken just two mouthfuls. The restaurant did not charge us for it. Ordered a fried squid to replace the octopus, and it was really ordinary with nothing to comment about. However, the disastrous evening meal did end with a wonderful dessert. The waiter's suggested rizogalo and it was great in both texture and taste. I would recommend it to end a meal. We will probably visit the restaurant one more time but we will surely skip the seafood
5
It was a special day for us and we went with friends for dinner. We had an amazing experience with food, drinks and excellent service. As it was a special day, the restaurant was very generous in treating us with amazing dissert wine. We continued till mid-night and had a great time. Look forward to going back again
5
Been here twice and was never disappointed. The food here is as good as the ones I have tried in Greece if not better. The ingredients used are so fresh you would have thought it was freshly caught. I don't drink but my friends say the wine selection is good. The portions are big so don't be so ambitious to order everything on the menu although you will be tempted to try. Ask for recommendations if too confused what you should order. You can't get more authentic greek food in Singapore. The bosses and chef is Greek so you know that you are getting the real deal. Go on an empty stomach so that you can eat, eat, eat. There is a deli at the side of the restaurant where you are buy Greek food stuff and know that it's as real as can be
5
Lovely meal with lots of different flavours and textures. Great decor, staff and fun for the kids. We'd visit again.
4
Great Greek food - which isn't too common around here in Singapore . Loved it - everything was so tasty (food portions can be huge so watch out). Would come again
4
Lovely ambiance; Good menu, beyond what other Greek restaurants in SG do; Great service, Good food.
Would highly recommend.
5
Greek food needs love, attention to detail, quality ingredients and good wine! Bakalaki is combining all of this plus a pinch of Greek sea breeze and olive trees! Good prices,friendly staff, Greek chef, Greek owner, ideal for families with kids but also for gathering with friends! Absolutely recommended ;-
5
Warm, casual and spacious restaurant in the hip locale of Tiong Bahru and a relatively new kid on the block! We loved the food - Hot fresh pita bread with the 4 dip platter was irresistible. The kalamari and the meat platter were very good too. The fried Halloumi cheese was amazing. The horiatiki Greek salad was made with fresh juicy tomatoes, crisp cucumber, tangy olives, creamy feta cheese and lots of olive oil - So delectable. The octopus (htapodi) is highly recommended.Desserts were good but just a tad too sweet for me.Service was excellent even with a busy Sunday lunch crowd.
5
Wow! Haven't had such a complete experience in a long time!The welcome, the service, the food, the ambiance, the comfort, the attention to details... all really great.You can really feel the passion of the owner. Everyone is smiling and friendly from the moment you enter the door, with real genuine attention. I love Greek food and I'm not easy to please in that department, but all our dishes were good, the selection is great and I found some specialties you don't regularly see outside Greece. It's decently priced, not cheap but fair for the quality you get.Our waiter was so nice to our daughter, he even found a little Kangaroo toy for her to play with.We'll be back as soon as I can get a table!The only cons are:- Almost Impossible to book a table on the same day. I guess that's the price of success...- I was so excited about the Deli in the corner, but didn't buy anything as the prices are just crazy
5
I heard rave reviews for Bakalaki which is a good sign considering the restaurant has only been open less than two months. I was not disappointed! As we were with a group of friends we jumped on the opportunity to order a good selection of appetisers as well as mains and it was great to see the servings plentiful! With every dish, was Colour, flavour and presentation, in a nutshell, the food was amazing and left us all wanting more! The service was very good considering the restaurant was busy for dinner service. The wait staff were attentive, kind and actually smiled, they made you feel welcome and were genuinely happy to be of assistance, which is rare in Singapore! We are already planning our return visit!
5
With the restaurant only open 6 weeks, it's a good sign when you already hear the chatter within the community that this is a must try. So we did and we were not disappointed! It's rare to go to a restaurant and have the eagerness to order the whole menu, but this was exactly the case at Bakalaki! Each dish we ordered was fresh and so delicious that we wanted to try everything, we gave it a decent crack but alas, will have to return to continue our food journey! Even though the restaurant was packed for dinner, the service was great and ambience was welcoming and comfortable. This restaurant is family friendly, groups and even intimate dinners as they also offer dining alfresco. So impressed and will be back!

There are pros and cons, so I'll try to keep it balanced.The food here is great. They're working with great fresh ingredients, which is not always easy to do in Singapore. It's also had a complete handsome renovation and it's a big, bright, airy space (though strangely, our table for four was small and we had to keep juggling dishes around). The menu is extensive, and it covers all your Greek favourites. It's an open kitchen, so you can watch the chefs at work. And, the restaurant has amazing bathrooms.Service-wise, the owners were on the floor and they are fantastic. Unfortunately, we did have to refer to them a couple of times during the night because the waitstaff didn't really have enough knowledge of the menu. They've only just opened, so that may change.There are a couple of other comments here that it's expensive, and it's true that they have pushed the pricing to the top end of what you'd be willing to pay. Sometimes that's ok (the salads, souvlaki and wine list are all reasonable value for money) and sometimes not so much (a basket of pita bread is 4 small pieces, so you need several baskets to get through a meal). And of course it is all bumped up by 17% at the end.Overall, I think it's a restaurant that offers a nice experience. It's fine-dining prices, but they are trying to offer the food, service and ambience that goes with that. At the moment the service is a little bit wobbly, and it would be nice to see them tweak their pricing on some items, but they are definitely doing a lot of things right
5
I highly suspect this place is soon to become the place to see and to be seen. At the time of writing, the restaurant is ranked only #854 on TripAdvisor. If it isn't top 100 in a few months then I'll eat my hat. DÃ©cor is stunning - the seagull-inspired spotlights are particularly adorable - and it was still very busy at 9pm and I just knew we were in for a treat. We were seated quickly at the bar (by a very handsome maitre d' - sorry, but it's true) and began being waited on on by our super friendly and attentive bartender. I don't know her name but she had sort of short hair on the sides and a cool fringe and deserves particular praise - never did she let our glasses drop even slightly below halfway and she guided us through the menu expertly also (advising we might want to choose to balance out our mains with some veggies rather than the two plates of chicken skewers we had asked for - she was absolutely right). We shared house white, spanakopita, halloumi and the chicken and roasted veg already mentioned. To finish we enjoyed divine homemade baklava and a shot of ouzo on the house (Yamas!). The whole meal was truly a delight from start to finish. If we lived in Singapore - sadly we're only visiting from the UK - we'd certainly be regulars. As it is, we may be back over the next few days as I saw a plate of calamari leave the kitchen as we left and almost wept - it looked so delicious! Seriously, though, keep it up, guys. You deserve every possible success. OPA!

Just loved this restaurant.....
Thank you Christos, Spiros, Giorgos.....
Wonderful food, great ambiance and friendly service.....
We will definitely come back again
5
The food, atmosphere and service is just great! Welcoming and friendly reception with food to die for. Very reasonably priced with a good selection of authentic Greek that goes with it. Would love to be here for a evening where you have a few ouzo's and throwing plates around!Great, well done
5
I visited here for lunch on Father's Day and it was very busy - pretty impressive as it has only been open for three weeks. The service was attentive and decor good. The food was really authentic, fresh and very good. We had some saganaki and calamari to start (if I closed my eyes I could have been in Greece!). We then ordered the meat platter - it was big - with a great selection of meats, all of which were beautifully cooked and came with some great chips. I had a small Greek salad too which was so good - the ingredients were such good quality. This was washed down with a very nice bottle of white wine (after an unsuccessful try of another wine which was way too acidic for me, the staff hastily changed it with no fuss to another great bottle). For dessert we had some divine baklava - one of my favourites and very authentic and my son loved the Greek doughnuts! It was a really nice, relaxed lunch and we all loved it. I know other's complained about the pricing but it is comparable to any other Singapore establishment so had no issue, especially as the whole experience was worth every penny. The portions were good too (we landed up taking some home as we couldn' finish it all!) Definitely go and give it a try
5
The best dips and greek salad. Food was very good, calamari and lamb chops. House red wine was great but for .5 litre close to $40!We did get a real shock with the bill - $210 which included a 10% tax and 7% GST so although we enjoyed the food we though it was too expensive
5
Guys A great evening had and all the things you would expect at a Greek restaurant. Good atmosphere. Loads of seating- we sat in the window but the seating at the back is great for a group. Food - amazing, great meat plater and Greek dips and of course the Greek salad was perfect..... highly recommend and of course. We will be back.
3
As the title said, the food was really good, had the Greek Salad and Grilled Octopus. For 3 dishes and a bottle of sparkling water for 2 and it costed us 100sgd. I think 11 dollar for a bottle of sparkling water plus tax and service charge is just overpriced. I would only go back if the prices would become more reasonable... on a different note great service to the waitress with black polo shirt and glasses. Very friendly!
5
I'll write about the food, service and atmosphere. But the reason I would return is that altogether - these guys want you to have a great night outThe room is big, and bright - we were greet by Christos. As usual - friendly and genuinely welcoming. The menu is fantastic - at least for us. It brings back memories of your best Greek holiday. We had the egg plant dip, and the favs dip. Both excellent. The crispy anchovies - wonderful, and I would have been more than happy to recline with a beer and a huge bucket of these!But we kept going, the lamb and beef kebab. Perfectly grilled, followed by the grilled octopus. Octopus and Greek salad are 2 ways to measure a kitchen - and these guys come out at the top of the pile. So, great service and food in a wonderful setting - brought together so this is a great night ou

This restaurant opened two weeks ago at the edge of Tiong Bahru. It is a large venue, with a good view of the kitchen. Staff is friendly, and we had the serving of the pita bread, Greek salad, grilled lamb and beef, and the meat balls. We had grilled octopus and the baked fish. Overall good food and great atmosphere.
4
Went to this newly opened Greek restaurant. Large space with stylish relaxed dÃ©cor. Seven adults. Food was mostly very good- but as usual we over ordered. Highlights included the whole sea bream, the feta with honey (superb), the Bakalaki salad and apparently the pita bread and dips were really good. Tried some Macedonian syrah which was very nice. The meat platter for two was on the large side- lamb chops and chicken were good as was the beef skewers. Minced meat patties were a bit on the salty side for my taste and the sausages were ordinary. The calamari disappeared from view very quickly.New restaurant so some of the serving staff were a little clueless but one guy in a black shirt took charge and offered us shots of ouzo at the end
5
Last Friday we had a great meal at Bakalaki, the highly anticipated new Greek taverna that just opened in Singapore's charming neighbourhood Tiong Bahru. Kudos to George, Christos, Spiros and their friendly & attentive team for a truly enjoyable evening out! If you're in the mood for good, traditional, Greek food this is definitely a to go to place. I understand Bakalaki for now is open for dinner 6pm onwards and for lunch on Fridays, Saturdays n Sundays. It's also worth knowing, you can buy a good selection of Greek delicacies to take home. And it's a place where you can enjoy a good Greek frappe:-) On Bakalaki's 9th evening of operation it was full house (180 pax, both indoors and outdoors) and the atmosphere was buzzy and alive with a mix of couples, families and groups of friends occupying the tables and counters.The light, airy decor in whites & woods with lots of Greek touches makes you feel happy. Enjoyed a refreshing Aphrodite cocktail (mastiha based with a hint of lemon, mint and chili) before we moved on to a crisp Sigalas white from Santorini. Bakalaki's Greek wines list is solid. The menu showed a wide variety of Greek traditionals, both in starters, salads and mains. We limited ourselves to some dips (the taramasalata was to die for!), pita bread, a yummy and simple carrot&cabbage salad accompanied by some super fresh gavros and calamari. In a true Hellenic way of hospitality we were offered some delightful sweet treats with chocolate dip as dessert. All in all, a lovely meal and we'll definitely be back to try more ....
