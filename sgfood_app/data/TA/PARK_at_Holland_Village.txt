Nice place, Service and food. Great atmosphere, a place to go with friends and I specially love their prosecco ! :-)

Great place for drinks and people watching. Interesting food, try the SPAM chips. Away from the hustle of Holland Village.

Completely satisfied with the prawn mentaiko (pasta) and the crispy barramundi served in a refreshing consomme. Beer on tap is available, as are cold-pressed juices. Reasonably priced, professional service too. Fuss-free experience. Highly recommendable.

It's a triangular area with two roads and a row of shop houses lining its boundaries. A small pub is on site.

Itâ€™s like a container cafe, located on the Park right outside Holland Village, hence the name Park.
Serves cafe fare and have lots of drinks on the menu.

Food was great and prices reasonable altho my main came after my husband had finished his as it came first long before mine and while my friend was halfway thru hers. Apart from that hiccup the quality was good. Nice setting for kids to run around while parents can keep an eye on them while sitting upfront

I go here on a regular basis as it is near my work place. It's a cute little bar on the green. Limited seating, but the service and bar staff are really nice. The food is pretty good and so are the drinks. On normal days it is pretty expensive, but I would recommend going on a Wednesday when Prosecco is only $5++ soooo good

This place was featured by various local bloggers so I thought to check it out and we were somewhat disappointed. It isn't all bad. The cold press juices they offer (at $5.80 i think) are genuinely nice and their service is good! However, I feel that one of their trademark dishes - Salted Egg Ribs is a disappointment. There is limited indoor seating so if you are there during mid-day and seated outside, it could get a tad uncomfortable.

Visited this place for a quick lunch after my haircut. Ordered mushroom cheese sandwich and iced latte. The sandwich came with a bucket of fries. The serving was huge. The reason for calling the sandwich average is the use of the pesto sauce. They were too generous with it. It was dripping oil as I held it to take a bite! Such a turn off! The iced latte was good though. The service was average too. Not attentive at all even though there were only six diners dining at the time. I was totally fine with getting cutlery and water myself as the waiter was no where to be seen but every single time I returned to my seat they would sound apologetic and asked me to call them if I needed anything. Am I supposed to shout for the waiter if they are out of sight?Overall, it's an average cafe. They have to improve on both food and service

Took the family here today. I have 2 fussy little girls and a partner from Argentina who knows what good beef taste like. We Loved this place. I could do a full review but better would be the family quotes. The Argentinian - the best beefburger I have ever tasted !!! Praise indeed considering she has eaten a lot of burgers all over the world The 8 year old was so full but would not give up on her chicken burger because "it's tooooooooooo gooood"My 5 year old was more obsessed with using her scooter so she just had fries but more than any of us could finish. Me I was in typical brit brunch mode and had the breakfast wrap. It was so full of eggs bacon and chicken I could not finish it but it was perfect for 1 of clock dining on a relaxed Sunday.

The ambience was great and the food served was great! The recommended Mac & Cheese, Mushroom Risotto and Truffle fries were excellent!
Even the pizza that was ordered, was nicely done. Great for friends, family and business meetings.

For Singapore, this is average priced (I suppose), but it is not worth the price tag. Would not recommend this place for coffee.
The breakfasts/brunches/salads looked good, though we weren't eating this time. Though they looked expensive on the menu!

Famed for its mac & cheese which was decent, it was not overly cheesey and still considering light for a brunch meal. Seats inside and outside - great to chill and watch the world go by.. great servers and perfect for meet ups with friends.

Easy place to find at front of Holland village. Serves Japanese beer and food is decent but basic. Burger ok. Setting quite ok for a catch up and chat.

This is a great place for a late weekend breakfast. We sat outside so we could watch the world go by whilst enjoying some great eggs and coffee.

We live about 10 minutes from PARK and love this place. Great to sit out and people watch while having a beer or ice tea. I love the Ginger Pear ice tea. They have great weekly specials and the service is fantastic. We have eaten the pulled pork tacos, french fries, SPAM chips (a must try) and crab cake sliders. It's very causal and a great place for a group. Holland Village is just around the corner, but PARK is our first and last stop on a night out.

Good:1) The food is nice2) Reasonable priceDownside:1) The waiter was not friendly and rude.2) I made a reservation via sms it said confirmed but upon arrival, they didnt have my booking . In the end they gave me a seat but the waiter said temporary we could take another seat. It made me wonder what did he mean by temporary? They were not even apologetic about it.3) Forever not picking up call and slow in responding via text. 4) Space is smal

PARK is a container-turned-cafe located just outside of the row of shops at Holland Village, which makes it very easy to spot!I've seen this cafe and bar around for a while but have never really gave it a try until we felt we need a new place for brunch.The brunch was quite pricey, we ordered an egg benedict, baked egg, a latte and a glass of orange juice, and it cost around $45-$50 (can't recall the exact amount). However, due to the fact that the brunch were all served in really big portion, we felt so full we didn't have anything else until dinner at 7pm. So, I guess we could say it's pricey but worth it.The latte was pretty good. The egg ben was a little bit overcooked for my liking though. The baked egg was good. This cafe is a bistro by night, I have never tried that so am not able to give comment on that

Lovely spot to have brunch on a weekend. It is right outside Holland Village MRT and hard to miss thanks to its yellow awning. Space is limited due to its quirky re-purposed container design, reservations are advised. There is indoor air conditioned seating and also alfresco seating. I liked that the outdoor has a high long table along the sides which is great for single dinners. The truffle Mac and cheese is delicious! The Eggs Royale, eggs Benedict wrapped in smoked salmon, was ok but found the hollandaise dressing lacking. The toast beneath however was perfectly crisp. The pulled pork burger came rolled up like a giant popiah with jalapenos and a side of fries. Didn't have enough space for desserts so I will definitely be back to try them. They have a surprisingly extensive drinks list. Check their food and drinks menu online at their website

We have been wanting to try PARK for awhile now, but it's a popular spot and we haven't hit the timing right to get a table for four, until tonight. We were content to sit outside, hearing the chatter of people sitting on the Nathan Yong designed park benches and feeling the evening breeze. The waitstaff was friendly enough and made some recommendations. There is no kids' menu here (likely because it's not really set up to be kid-friendly with mostly bar stool seating), but portions are not too big, so that was okay. Our youngest ordered the cod and chips. The fish and the breading around it tasted terrible as did the sad excuse for tartar sauce. Her fries were covered in a smoky seasoning that most young kids would not enjoy, so there it would have been good for the server to inform us of this so we could have ordered them plain. Our eldest had the mac and cheese, which had been baked and tasted okay (same seasoning sprinkled on top). My partner and I shared the caesar salad (mediocre) and the pork belly. We also all shared the truffle fries. These latter two items were done up really well and saved the meal, albeit killed the waistline! Would be nice if they had a variety of healthy choices on the menu; it's fairly one-dimensional with mostly meat, lots of eggs (even the garden salad has a poached egg on it) and cream. We've heard that PARK is better for its breakfasts, so maybe that is worth a try
