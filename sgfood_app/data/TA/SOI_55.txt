Its refreshing....either you can get it cold/hot.
We can also add sago, pearls, ruby to the drink.
The Thai Milk Tea is the best but they are Thai coffee, green tea...

Love the Thai Iced Milk tea from Soi55. Initially I thought it will taste like our coffeeshop teh-ping (ice tea) but the flavour is very different and taste really authentic like the Thailand teas. I didn't really try the other flavours and the only flavour I had was the milk tea. Personally, I think the green tea variations are a bit strange but I think its just individual preference. They have convenient take away bottles that seem slim but are actually quite voluminous. Was reminded to add ice to the take away tea that I brought home as it'll be too sweet. Pricing is reasonable and is between your coffee shop drink and your starbucks pricing, so I think that's pretty fair. Glad to know they have another branch at Cathay where you can actually bring it into the cinema without being harassed by the management. Hope to see more branches soon
