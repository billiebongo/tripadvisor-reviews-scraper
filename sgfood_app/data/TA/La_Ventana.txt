Had dinner again, this time with a quite picky local business partner. Had some excellent Tapas to start and share ( Jamon was best ); then everybody different main course to perfection. Nice desert, good wine at reasonable price.
Will definitely go again.

The staff is friendly. Though the resto doesn’t offer much of food choices, the taste is delicious from the food in the menu. Definitely recommended for quiet and romantic bites.

A birthday dinner for the Wife with a few friends was just fantastic. We all ordered the same gastro menu with two of us opting for wine pairing which was great. Would recommend anytime!

In this restaurant you will find normal Spanish cuisine, that is very current and cheap in Spain. But la Ventana proposes simple dishes for way too expensive prices. Won’t come back

My hubby and I dined here on Saturday night. The first disappointment was the wine list. Very limited and not as much Spanish wine as you would think. No Albariño or even Rioja to be sighted on the menu. We ended up having a bottle of champagne as there was no whites or reds of any interest at all. The food menu at first glance we were happy with. Until the food arrived. The jamon on bread with tomato is usually one of our favourite dishes, however the bread was extremely soggy and not crispy like the usual crystal bread you would have it served on. The cannelloni was a disappointment, the meat was quite dry plus I am comparing it to the cannelloni at Esquina which is the best I’ve ever had! The octopus was very rubbery and was not enjoyable to eat at all. We also had the salad with seasonal vegetables. The salad was nice - came with walnuts though and there was no mention of that on the menu (my hubby is allergic) but the seasonal vegetables consisted only of peas nothing else. Maybe they need to change it to seasonal vegetable. I will give credit where it’s due though - the tuna tartare and the jamon croquettes I must admit were quite delicious. The service was very good, very attentive but not overly so, quick at filling up your glasses and the fact that they changed your plates AND cutlery (a rarity it Singapore) after every dish was a pleasant surprise.

Came this place for my husband's birthday celebration during lunch. Lunch set menu was pretty yummy. We both loved it. Though pricing was on the higher side, Service was great. Atmosphere was good.To my surprise, they remembered that I mentioned I was going to celebrate my hub's bday when I made the reservation. What made the whole experience great was they came with a small plate of pastry with candle lit. Definitely complete the entire celebration.. Thank you La Ventana.

Been there the other day. Menu is completely changed and while more Creative, there is almost nothing to share. Also seems prices have increased.I have been a regular there and seems to me less Spanish than before. Almost no traditional dishes.Wish they will return to the origins. Been there several times with the family but I can hardly imagine going now
1
Went with a friend on a Friday night. Nice outdoor seating. Ordered beef which was very salty and it came with a sort of thai salad which was completely inedible. The worst part is how they handled the feedback: we told them to inform the chef that the food is not good and we returned half of my dish but nothing was done, no one came to check on us or apologize for the bad food. Apart from this the ambiente is nice but the food is very overpriced for what it is as well...so this was definitely the first and last time I went there !

Need to impress ? This is a good place but it will cost you a little more than usualSeating outdoors is really quite magical, with a unique organic approach to mosquito repellent. Thoughtful table lamps are brought with the menu so you can order but we had to try and remember what we were eating later on because lighting is otherwise a little dim. No complaints though because it was a truly romantic eveningFood is tasty but portions tiny. Paella is recommended. Desserts were very delicious too.Service was excellent, and the recommendation for wine hit the spot after an exhausting workday Will definitely be bac

I had heard from a number of people that this is one of the better Spanish restaurants in Singapore. Arrived relatively early -6.30 - and were seated at a nice indoor table. Had a couple glasses cava which were ok. Ordered a selection of starters and then a squid ink paella to share. The starters were average at best. Oysters with gin and tonic didn't taste of anything but oyster. The jamon on tomato bread was soggy and tasted not at all of tomato. The croquettes with ham were very tasty. The carpaccio was ok. Kind of small portion and the relish in the centre was very tart and mustardy. The paella was disappointing. 2 large shrimps in the middle but otherwise no shellfish to be seen. Tasted ok but nothing special. Plus we asked for al aioli but were told none was to be had. In a Spanish restaurant!!!!! Had a bottle of Chivite Chardonnay with the meal. Was the best thing we had all night. Dessert was nice. Basically French toast with apple sauce. Service was a bit odd. Mixture of offhand and overzealous. We were done by 8 pm. Cherry on the top was that Yuko felt nauseous later that night and woke up twice with symptoms of mild food poisoning. So all round a bit of a let down. 6.5 out of 10 at best.
5
Excellent 8 dishes course with a corresponding vine menu.
Food excellently prepared and served by knowledgable, competent and friendly staff.
Certainly recommendable, maybe even better in a romantic setting.

If the weather's not too bad, its actually worth sitting outside. The terrine and octopus starter dishes were great. Squid ink risotto was passable. We enjoyed the attention from the service crew.
4
We sat in the garden. So pretty. Good wine list. Tapas nice, but only a few options. Desserts were very nice.
5
I have eaten here many times. I can say once again
Excellent food, excellent wine, excellent service and a fantastic venue to enjoy a great night.
5
Returning yet again - happy to see new menu options. However the firm favourites have been kept on the menu. Great food, wine, ambience and service. Love the goldfish bowl of Gin n' tonic.
We will be back again and again!

A nice & cosy restaurant at Dempsey Hill. We always love their octopus, Iberico jamon, tuna belly & paella. They also serve very good Spanish wine at a reasonable price.If you like Spanish tapas with a good environment & ambience, Le Ventana is always a good choice
2
Went there for a dinner with a group of friends.The place looks good as it is nested in the "jungle of Dempsey hill". The food was quite average. Starter was very disappointing, main was quite ok, desert was average.Overall it would be acceptable if it were not for the quantities that are ridiculously small. I am not a big fan of restaurant offering very large portion, but in that case this is just not right: you cannot give such a small quantity and call that a main for instance.Finally the price is clearly too high, both for the quantity and the quality.There are other options way more interesting if you look for that kind of food.
1
What I cannot understand is that restaurants can think they can get away with total over-pricing and get away without comment, appetizer, scallop(s), well only got 1 scallop with half a snow pea decorated, could not believe it, then main pigeon ( looked more like a parakeet leg), could barely see the meat, with 1 dumpling and yet commanding a high price. With such a nice ambience and yet such over priced meals is just not justified, will give this place a pass and I rarely sound out but I could wait to get out, so skipped coffee and dessert as I was still hungry and had to go eat at another resto to feel satisfied. This place is a "NO GO" I am not sure what I ate as it is supposed to be Spanish but more fusion or rather CONFUSIO
3
I heard rave reviews of this place and how impossible it would be to secure a reservation albeit its higher price range. Frankly I find it so so as the creatively with food elements was minimal. It's tasty but forgetable. There was not a dish that I reacted with positive rave exclamations. Service was ok. Nothing over the top. Nobody introduce nor recommend any specials.
4
Wonderful afternoon spent at La Ventana as a family. The service was impeccable and the ambience and atmosphere was just brilliant. Definitely recommend sitting outside when you go. Food was ok, a bit difficult for children. A children's menu could help. But overall a fantastic experience and definite recommendation!
4
Went for the tasting dinner with wine pairing by special guest chef Miguel Cobo. Value for money experience in a lovely restaurant.
5
Loved the place and will definitely come back soon. Great value tapas in authentic Spanish style. Enchanted.
5
Had a great meal sitting outside under the big trees. It's a treat in Singapore. Great location, good food and wine. We will be back!
5
This restaurant along with its service never disappoints me. It is a must try if you enjoy good Spanish food, good Spanish wine list, service and atmosphere. The garden setting is fantastic.
5
Food, Service, Ambiance - all outstanding as always. What a great addition La Ventana has been to the Singapore dining scene. Great restaurant and staff.
5
The meal was excellent I had suckling pig for main and octopus for starter. The dessert was excellent too.
The setting was wonderful. Sitting outside was quiet and there were fans to keep cool.

Caveat - food would have rated a 3. And service a 4 (initially). But bill shock and cavalier attitude of staff made rating a 1Came here for dinner with my wife whilst kids stayed at home, as she wanted some tapas to chill and relax.Food was hit and miss. Some were very good and some felt like it was stale.Cava sangria was a bit too sweet.My wife liked the Salmorejo soup.I liked the marinated trout.Both of us liked the gin & tonic infused oysters.The bacalao (cod) salad wasn't too bad but I get the cod could have more flavour.I couldn't taste the foie gras in the foie gras and mushroom omelette but the omelette was done well.Octopus Gallego was too soft and didn't taste fresh.But what got me going and made me decide to give a 1 raring was all because of a $3.50 bread basket. I always liked bread and we have asked for extra bread in many restaurants without being charged extra. Here, not only do they charge extra, they do not tell you upfront that it's chargeable. Only when I saw the bill did I notice that I had been charged $3.50 for the extra portion of bread.When I feedback to the waitress (after I had paid the bill inclusive of this charge) that I was not informed of the extra bread charge, she said "We always charge for extra bread". After paying more than $200 for the meal, and getting such cavalier attitude, I won't be going back
3
Had a nice time in the garden outdoor La ventana, sadly the menu is not very exciting at all, i will say very simple, not elaborated as it should be. It is not much spanish, they had fusion in everything, the cheese platter not on the menu but still served was french and spanish cheese; weird for a spanish restaurant. They change Chef recently , and i think it is a bit aprroxiamtive. Service is not the standard of Michelin restaurant sadly. You have to ask for bred constantly like in Paris
5
Been here couple of times, the new menu served last night blowed my mind away. Ordered the Fried pork covered with rice, grilled octopus, oyster soaked with gin, foie gras biscuits , lobster paella..of course come with several good choices of wine ..served by friendly waitress ...! Make my day..
4
We went there with my wife for dinner and booked outdoor seating (very nice - facing the garden with nice lighting) - this nice was horrible weather with huge storm and heavy, heavy rain. However we could really enjoy our sitting outside and went through all our dinner without any inconvenience.The menu proposed is really appealing. Tapas are great - don't miss anchovies as well as of course the ham - the black rice is really good (1 to share between 2 is Ok), but special mention to the octopus (prepared as "pulpo a la gallega") which was absolutely delicious. For desert, do not miss the Torrija, it's just amazingly good :)The wine list is absolutely great, with all my favourites, and at acceptable price.Last but not least, the staff is really great and service was spotless.Great place 
5
The setting was simple but cosy. The selection of Spanish wine was good and reasonably priced. And the tapas were great, especially the suckling pig and the squid ink paella. But I am surprised that the restaurant does not serve churros for dessert.
5
Food was nice, Great choice of wine and good ambience. excellent service. will definetely visit again.

Had dinner w my Husband n Son. Both appreciate beef n gave the thumbs up.
Had the catalan Creme brûlée ,not the traditional Creme brûlée , abit sweet though

It was my wife's birthday. I made reservations for lunch at La Ventana. My wife is a vegetarian, so I ensured I went to their website and checked out the menu. I was glad to see that their website listed sufficient vegetarian options. Upon reaching the restaurant, we were given a totally different menu with almost no vegetarian options. They said the menu had changed but they hadn't bothered to update their website. And they could not even prepare anything vegetarian (except garden salad, I think) upon request. We had no option but to leave and roam around Dempsey looking for another place to eat. Not the way I wanted my wife's birthday to play out.One more disappointing thing about this place is that they have no wheelchair/pram access (i.e. no slope or elevator). We had gone there with our 1yo in a pram and you need to go down a flight of stairs to get to the restaurant. When I asked one of the waitresses if there was a way to get the pram down, she just curtly said - just carry it down. So we lugged the pram with the baby in it all the way down, only to have to carry it all the way back up, without even eating at the place! Hmm... I'm definitely not going back to this place and neither are our friends/colleagues. There are plenty of better options right at Dempsey

We were looking for a tapas style meal in the neighbourhood and decided to give La Ventana a try. The score :1. Nice location - feels tucked away. The dining room is bright and cheerful and there is plenty of al fresco seating on the outside.2. Good selection of Spanish wine. Quite an under-rated category that more people should discover. 3. Delicious tapas dishes though the selection was not as wide as we would have liked and there was perhaps too many potato based dishes. Octopus dishes was tiny. 4. Very good suckling pig - it was on the specials menu and we ordered it as an after thought. Even though we were already satisfied from the tapas, we finished all of this dish. No room for dessert so that will have to be for next time. It was very nice to see the chefs make a round of the dining room and chatting with every table.
3
We dined here as part of a relatively large group of 8 and had a very pleasant evening. We opted for the 'Gran Ã€pat' tasting menu, which was very good. I particularly enjoyed the Jamon Iberico and the Lobster Paella. Although I love foie gras, it came rather late in the 8 course extravaganza, and was a little rich for a latter stage dish. The service was pleasant enough, although they were obviously (& understandably) keen for us to pay and leave as quickly as possible. The wine list was particularly impressive, even the 'by the glass' list was extensive, but the list of Spanish bottles was superb
1
Tried the iberico ham which was nothing special. Also had the squid ink paella. The prawns as well as the paella were too salty. Was a very sad dinner. Went home hungry.
5
We found this place after we googled that it served Vichy Catalan! As a person obsessed with great water along with my meals, I m happy that this restaurant served the legendary label. We sat outside on a beautiful evening, we recommend seats closer to the entrance as there are cold air blowers improving the atmosphere. The temperature is warmer further in so if available, ask for seats closer to the entrance if you chose to seat outside. The menu is lovely, and do check out the specials for the day. As a Spanish food lover, I ordered Pedron Peppers, Jamon Iberico and Carabinero Prawns ( ask for these grilled as they are not on the menu) with paella and duck confit for our mains. It isn't a 3 star michellin restaurant but my expectations are blown away with the food. I highly recommend this as a lovely place for a date, special event and just good friends get together and just be nice to the staff and they will unduly return the favor. Bravo!
3
Utterly confused about why a restaurant with a Michelin Chef would have food that's below par. The Pigeon Paella had oozed with oil and yet the pigeon was cooked perfectly. This is just one example of contradictions in quality. We both had prolonged indigestion and an unhealthy thirst after dining here. Expectations from the creds were only partially met. What a waste, as I simply loved the service and ambience.
3
This was our 2nd visit. We were there for dinner in Jan for the 1st time and it was very, very good. This time was for lunch. Their set lunch choices were not impressive. The octopus from their a-la-carte menu was for soft but blend in taste. However, I must say their dessert was spectacular
5
Authentic Spanish food and wine. Excellent knowledgeable service. I went back for a second time within a month with work so I could have more of the lobster paella.
4
Good Spanish food - a great restaurant with a great menu and delicious food. Give this one a try in Dempsey you will not be disappointed. Enjoy the meal and the service. Enjoy.
5
Always enjoy eating at this restaurant. The food is delicious, good choice of wine and the service is very good. Sitting outside with the jungle setting makes the dining experience very special. 👍
3
While the service was good and the ambience was nice, the food was very disappointing. My partner and I had high hopes but we were disappointed.
5
Chanced upon this restaurant while walking around Dempsey. Pretty, cosy ambiance with friendly staff. Authentic Spanish fine dining. The food and service was top-notch excellent. Highly recommended, especially for a special occasion such as birthdays.

We have been to La Ventana three times and loved it every time. The tapas were excellent, quickly served and piping hot and crispy. Tonight we were celebrating my husband's retirement, so chose one of our favorite places. We ordered a very nice bottle of wine (which was very good) a bunch of our favorite tapas (which were delectable) and beef for our son and a pigeon risotto to share between us. We usually have the squid ink risotto, but opted to try something different this time. The beef came and looked and tasted brilliant, but there was a delay of some 20 minutes before our risotto came. This was after two nudgings to the staff. The risotto finally arrived and it looked a bit undercooked. We poked around, tried it and found it to be totally tasteless. And to make matters worse, the pigeon breast on the top of the risotto was completely rare. We asked for our bill, and made our dissatisfaction known to the manager, who agreed with us that the poultry was in fact raw, and to his credit agreed not to charge us for the risotto.We will now, probably not return to La Ventana, which is a shame. This is a common problem in Singapore. The first few times you visit a restaurant it is brilliant, then either the chef leaves, or the standards just relax, and everything goes downhill. Shame
4
First time visit at La Ventana, the restaurant has a nice romantic ambience, but got noisy when groups of people came in. Food was delicious. Had lobster paella as main course, and some tapas for sharing. Paella was delicious but portion was very small. Foie gras tapas was yummy, cod fish salad was average, chicken potatoe croquettes were average too. The tapas with ham on the crusty bread was fantastic. Service was average too. Did not feel the warm welcome from the staff
5
Good food but a tad bit salty. To be fair, they offered to change the salad when we feedback on the saltiness
4
My friends and I enjoyed a lovely time at La Ventana on Friday night. The dishes - octopus, paella, scallops, and starters - were unique and elegantly presented. Service throughout the meal was attentive, good-humored, and efficient. We sat outside on a superb tropical evening enjoying the lush green surroundings amid the soft clank of cutlery and dinner conversaions.The one jarring aspect of our experience was the music provided. We wondered why, at a Spanish restaurant obviously attentive to ambience, the managers would choose to have 70's-80's oldies playing at some volume. Glancing around at fellow diners, I failed to spot the demographic that might have appreciated the musical mix provided.Wouldn't a Spansh guitar have been atmospheric? Soft jazz? Ambient rock? Nature sounds? Just suggestions.We hope to return to le Ventana, but may pause at the step and listen before we make our final dining choice.

Spanish restaurant, located in a beautiful surrounding in Dempsey hill. I popped in on a Saturday evening without a reservation. The restaurant was full but the smiling hostess immediately seated us . Menu and wine list were immediately put on the table. We ordered a few dishes. All perfectly prepared. The anchovies tapas , the paella with lobster and the one with black ink, are all to die for. I was slightly disappointed by the pulpo, very bland and way too soft. After dinner, the chef came out, and apologised. This is what differentiate an average restaurant with a very good restaurant. It is not only the food but the service and the attention. And this is why I will continue to go back to La Ventana, one of the best spanish in Singapore
5
Fine dining, beautiful environment, great service. Try the croquetas iberico, chicken wings, squid ink paela. Don't leave without a desert!
5
Had a great dinner with work colleagues. Authentic Spanish food and taste. Great service and presentation. We also wanted items that were not on the menu and they accommodated us. Anchovies , croquette, manchego as tapas and Duck confit as main were amazing. Strongly recommend
5
excellent food. great service. nice ambience (if you sit outdoors rather than indoors). highly recommend the charcoal tuna belly and iberico ham.
5
Had lunch here! Wow! Great set lunch!! Amazing food and wines selections! Had their tapas selections which comes with anchovies bread!! Worth the while!!
4
Nice place to have lunch and the ambience is great. They have alacarte menu or a a tapas degustation deal depending on what you're in the mood for. All good and was accompanied by some nice cava. Friendly and personal service
5
We ordered 2 set lunches and a salad. The set lunch was priced at a reasonable $48, which is value for money considering that my main course was a very tender pork cheek and my dinning partner's was a very nicely done cod. We shared the salad. We agreed that the balance of sweetness and touch of vinaigrette highlighted the fresh produce. The place was quiet, the greenery outside made it particularly pleasant and the staff attentive yet not intrusive
5
We ordered mainly tapas as we did not want to have a big meal. Although delicious and, the portions were a bit too petite, which left us wanting more! We had a lovely time catching up with friends we haven't seen for many years and it was great to enjoy the food, wine and company at in one night! Will go back again to try the rest of the menu
5
Lovely restaurant in a beautiful place, Dempsey. Choose the terrace to have your dinner, you don't feel like being in Singapore. A very romantic atmosphere. Their lobster paella is to die for. All their tapas are excellent and they have a very good selection of Spanish wine. I would not eat inside as it is very noisy
5
I had read about the opening of this restaurant and was curious to try. Overall it was an excellent experience although the portion sizes of some dishes could have been more generous.
5
We loved this quiet, nicely decorated place with a green patio which makes this restaurant ideal for couples and families. We shared tapas which were exquisite (I recommend the Canelon) and they can be perfectly paired with wine as their wine by the glass selection is pretty wide. The Spanish male manager looked after us, friendly and very pro as well as the service staff overall. Wonderful experience 
5
Love this quiet and beautiful place hidden in Dempsey hill. Great food and wine and really worth the price. Service is also sweet and just right.
5
really enjoyed the terrace and the food was very high quality. The spanish ham was a great starter and all dishes tasty and well presented.
3
Although the quality and the presentation of the dishes were fine, the prices are pushed too high, especially the wines. This is disappointing since the place is quite nice but we won't go back due to the very average value for money.
4
Food was really good, and the ambience was quite romantic. sitting outside you would be beside some greenery which was really nice during the night.
5
A table of 8 we shared tapas and paella. Gosh what amazing Flavours of Spain but with such an interesting twist. Pigeon paella was incredible. All with great service and set in a beautiful garden. We sat outside on the veranda on a humid night, it was lovely. A great find!
4
Very pretty and stylish spot in Dempsey, with indoor and outdoor seating. Delicious Spanish food and wine with good service. I have had lunch and dinner at La Ventana and both were excellent experiences. I have to admit, I closed my eyes once or twice and imagined I was in Spain. The standout dishes for me are the octopus and the black cod paella
4
Enjoyed the fresh Tsarskaya Oysters, their signature cannelloni and crispy suckling pig. Expected more of the squid ink paella as it was highly recommended by the staff. But it was a little too dry and the clams and prawns weren't succulent enough. The octopus was soft and melts in your mouth. But I didn't like the sauce which drowned out the natural sweetness and flavor of the meat. Ambiance is nice, with greenery all around. Great to sit outside if weather is cool and not rainy. Service was prompt and servers were friendly.
4
I have eaten at La Ventana a couple of times and the only constant is the food. When I have a chance I choose the tapas to get a taste of all flavours. The quality is excellent and the presentation sober enough to focus on the food. The selection is generous and it is imperative to find a good balance between fried items and the non fried. The service always starts out well but slowly diminishes as the meal winds down. Especially during lunch staff tends to concentrate on leaving rather then on the guests.The interior is ambivalent and nor here nor there. If you make a reservation ask for a table at one of the round tables at the window
4
Robust selection of wines and tapas dishes. Went for the tasting menu this time and for the most part was blown away. The squid-ink rice was very salty, and the creme brule was not brule'd at all. Every other dish was heavenly.Prices are high (as is the norm for Singapore), but the dishes are generally rich and heavy so you don't leave hungry!Attentive service and a beautiful outdoor terrace make this a repeat destination
5
Had a great lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The good was good n service was excellent. Love the surroundingsWe ordered a few tapas to share and had their recommended pigeon paella. Pigeon was medium rare n the rice al dente . Pigeon was so tender n delicious..was such a tad salty. The other dish that was a delightful surprise was the noodle paella. It tasted like the local braised yee mee..which was so delicious that we polished everything!The only disappointment that day was the Suckling pig. It wasn't as crispy n piggy was too fatty n had a strong smell..
5
A hidden restaurant organized like a family affair. The service people came from the family. It was very attentative and efficient. I loved the Hands on approach. Food was excellent. The squid ink paella was far out goodness
4
Had a dinner for four adults and four kids. We stayed outside: green, outside air con, away from the road (great for kids to run around). Very good service. Food was good but some dishes were not excellent.
5
Just had a wonderful lunch today, excellent tapas, must try - croquet, anchovi on bread, cod, paella and Creme Catalan! Service was seem less and friendly! Will definitely be back!
5
As a Spaniard, I affirm that La Ventana does serve authentic Spanish (mostly Catalan) food. I do recommend the restaurant if you are looking for a quiet meal enjoying fine-dining Spanish cuisine.
5
Friendly service. Excellent food. Location picture perfect especially if you sit outside where you are surrounded by trees and greenery.
5
Great food to share. My favorites are the foie gras cookie, all paella, suckling pork, and cod. Beautiful outdoor ambiance for a perfect experience.
5
We saw this restaurant recommended as Singapore Top 10 Tapas restaurant. It's located at Dempsey, quiet place and forest kind of outdoor seating. Good for dinner and even for special occasions. They do provide high tea at $38 on weekdays. Michelin chef. We tried the chicken wings and whisky pineapple. Nice food nice wine. Abit pricey but definitely worth the price.
5
I went for the first time for a business dinner for two people. Options to sit in or outdoors. Relaxed yet smart feeling to it.Food was excellent. We tried full selection of traditional tapas as well as the pork belly and lamb rack. We also tried the desserts which were very god too.Good wine list. Quite costly so one for special occasions
5
We had a lovely tapas lunch with sangria on the terrace surrounded by a lush tropical garden giving you the feeling of sitting in a well kept jungle. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. We arrived with our dog and they let us bring her to the terrace to sit with us. The tapas was very tasty albeit a bit pricy. I would say overall a good balance considering the nice surroundings. I will come again
4
This is the first visit for me. it was difficult to locate the restaurant as it was hidden off the main road and my friend and I almost given up. At the restaurant we were promptly seated. Service was excellent. We were given recommendations to our wine choice, we took it and it was excellent. We ordered tapas, paella and a meat dish to share. It was truly a great dining experience. Definitely would return.
5
The restaurant is located in a very quiet place.It is nice to have fantastic food in woods~and the staffs there are very friendly~
3
We tried this restaurant on a mid week impulse. We loved the position and ambiance of the place. As for food, although tasty it was not that remarkable. The portions were small for the price we paid. Staff as stated earlier although minimally attentive were far from friendly. So that was a disappointment. Such potential wasted
4
We reserved online - which is really convenient and fast.The setting of the restaurant is almost jungle like - especially sitting at the outdoor seating.Simple but nice and comfortable furniture.Service in general very friendly and professional.Little waiting time to take the order and get served.The spanish estrella galicia draught beer was served fresh and very chilled.We started with a couple of Tapas - with Jamon, Anchovies and Canelloni - all of them extremely juicy and very tasty.Nicely prepared Patatas Bravas and charcoal grilled veggies rounded the starters. To try something new we ordered the Pigeon Paella - for me a very new taste and one has to get used to it, but the meat was very tender and well prepared - to make it short it was worth the try.As dessert we had a Chocolate Coulant - a warm chocolate cake with lot's of dark good quality chocolate and a scoop of vanilla ice cream - really recommendable!I found the excellent red wine (Tondonia Rioja) not exactly cheap, but acceptable knowing the wine prices in Singapore.In all a nice and recommendable dining experience in a cool setting, but be prepared to spend about 300 SGD for 2 person
2
We try to go restaurants without expectation, but i had high hopes for this one! The atmosphere was lovely, we sat on the balcony with a wall of thick jungle as our backdrop which was cool and fresh. Service was good - not overly friendly though, wine wasn't amazing, the food was very disappointing and having traveled through Spain let me confused. The menu had the names right, but what came out was a shadow of what i had experience in Spain. Quirky toilets which were nice and would be great for drinks with a group of friends but overall wouldn't go there again unless the food improved
5
Went for lunch yesterday. Ordered 4 Tapas....Anchovies, Foie Gras, Iberico Ham and Cannelloni. Also ordered some one dessert, bItter chocolate cake with strawberries and icecream. Each dish was mouth-wateringly good. The wines was a tad expensive but it is a fine dining restaurant so I guess it's acceptable. The staff was extremely attentive and polite. Had a wonderful afternoon and wouldn't fault this restaurant for anything
5
Authentic Spanish tapas. Setting great, service great, excellent Spanish wine list and great food. Will continue to go back there.
3
We had booked a table for 8 people on a Saturday night on the terrace. We've had tapas and paella and a few bottles of wine. the food was very good and the Spanish sommelier's recommendations for the wine was very useful. The atmosphere on the terrace facing the illuminated jungle is fascinating. The only disappointment though was when the staff began to clean and empty the terrace as we were still eating, OK it was already 11pm and we're not in Spain (where people start eating at that time...) still, the staff could wait until the last guests are gone. At some point we were asked by two staff carrying a table to squeeze against our table to allow them to pass behind us... come on... This was quite a disappointment to end like this this so far pleasant evening
2
La Ventana is a Spanish restaurant located in Dempsey. The access and the surroundings are very beautiful. When we enter in the restaurant we realize than we will deal with posh tapas !The staff is nice and we are comfortably installed. When we open the menu, the first feeling is confirmed. We are in a posh tapas place with expensive dishes and extremely expensive wine... But why not if the quality and the service are here. We order few tapas, a salmon tartar, some signature pastas and a bottle red wine Rojas with double digit price (not easy to find). Tapas are very good, a bit salted for the brandade... But it is normal. Excellent wine served by one of the manager... Polite but not extremely kind. The salmon tartar is served... Not bad but we can not really taste the salmon... Pastas are coming with cannelloni we did not really ordered. Little fight with the second owner who affirms we ordered it... After few seconds she brings back the cannelloni with bad mood. The signature pastas are very good even if not served in a plate which is not really appropriate... To bad for the "beautiful" effect. From this time, we had to pour the wine ourself. We ask for the bill which is as "salted" as the cod. La Ventana is a very beautiful posh tapas restaurant... Too bad the managers are not as nice as the place. Food and wine don't worth the amount we paid.Maybe next time it will help if I dress with suit and the beautiful ladies who came with me with dresses... By the way, there won't be a next time.

I recommend dearly this amazing restaurant in a very natural, stunning location on Dempsey Hill. Not the common expat retreat (like many places nearby where expat wives do their shopping), but designed for those who love Catalan and Spanish cuisine matched with excellent wines you cannot buy from rack.A top notch experience for me and better than places in Barcelona I have been (I lived there for eight years).Great service

I decided to do my son's first communion there on a Saturday afternoon. I picked the place because we could see the children from inside and still allow them some freedom. The service from the very beginning was impeccable, the girl that helped us was "very" patient with our many changes and requests. The food was as amazing as usual, maybe a little too gourmet for the children but all of our adult guest were complementing us on the choices. They were very accommodating, we even needed a gluten free cake and they prepared it for my son. For me it was a total success and I believe it was because of the culture of this restaurant. They were open and helpful beyond the norm. I highly recommend it for events!

Went on wed for business lunch. The chef Charles served the food to us and even asked us how was everything. Felt so homely and sincere. Food wise was superb. We had quail paella, suckling pig, lamb rack and black cod. Everything was beautifully done.
5
Was blown away by the food - from tapas to the desserts!
possibly the best Spanish(Catalan) food in Singapore.
The Creme brûlée is must!!
1
We just had lunch at la ventana. The service was terrible. No one was interested in asking us how the meal was, no topping up of glasses etc. food was distinctly average and very over priced. We would not bother going again.
5
Varied and interesting tapas menu, very good service and pleasant setting. Really liked the selection of wines by the glass - overall an authentic taste of Spain.

Lovely Spanish food. Loved the posh patatas bravas and creme brûlée. Great setting with seating outside. You can BYO wine and get charged corkage which they take off if you order another bottle of wine from them. Really enjoyed the food.

went for friday dinner -- needed something really good after one of those weeks at work. started with a nice oloroso as wife and i were a tad early for our 8:30 table. room brightly lit in the spanish style, room quite busy and smelled strongly of oily fish. not the best first impression to be honest. but man did the meal make up for it. this may be our new favorite place in singapore. have read some of the crappy reviews of this place and while everyone's experience may differ, ours was outstanding. ok, the servers were occasionally overeager: that's singapore. portions on the small side? dunno: they felt about perfect to us given the richness and delicacy of the dishes. we started with some tapas classics as a test: bunuelos, croquetas and canelon. the last was a tad salty but the others were damn near perfection: light, fluffy, delicately flavored. i lived in barcelona for a while and never had these dishes so well prepared. on to the mains: suckling pig for the wife, who is addicted to suckling pig -- a truly heavenly rendition, the meat light, almost fluffy, the skin paper-thin, akin to a really good peking duck. i had the pigeon (a real rarity in SG) -- i love pigeon and order it any chance i get, and this was easily the best rendition i have had in the last 15 years, anywhere on earth. don't think it's possible to cook this bird any better. from a well-composed list, we chose a nice priorat to wash it all down with. a bit left after the mains so i got a half a cheese plate to soak it up -- the half plate was plenty for both of us. all in all, i can heartily recommend this place to anyone who appreciates or wants to get to know catalan cuisine. we will return, and soon

My family took me today to La ventana as a treat for mother's day. My Spanish friends had been raving about it for months and I had wanted to go for a while. Being Spanish I have tried a few Spanish restaurants and I can say that La Ventana is the best restaurant I had tried for a while in Singapore. We stuck with the tapas menu and only had a main but every single dish was amazing. The flavours were authentic but innovative and dating at the same time. This is usually a difficult challenge as sometimes the cuisine of a country can get lost when it comes to fine dining. This is not the case with La Ventana where the balance between the two is perfect. Cannot wait to get back and try some more dishes.
5
I'm writing this because of one dish I had, which was exceptional - the slow cooked Welsh lamb rack with goat cheese parmentier. I grew up eating lamb in Tasmania and have eaten it since in every form and in dozens of places from North China to Europe to the US, but this has to be one of the best lamb experiences ever. It's served as cutlets rather than as a single rack, and it comes with the fat on because that's part of what gives it the flavour - but you can cut the fat off (I do). Not cheap, but worth it.Croquetas and Jamon Iberico 'de Bellota' also helped make it worth the visit
5
Beautiful restaurant set in an orld military encampment. I think the building that houses it must have been used a barracks in the past. The restaurant faces some nice greenery and al fresco dining was available. Service from the primarily Spanish staff was excellent and attentive.The food was an imaginative take on Catalan. There was an good selections of tapas and main courses. Desserts were outstanding.Making plans to go back soon

La Ventana stays very true to the Spanish / catalÃ¡n tradition of dining. The tapas are creative, tasty, and authentic. The great selection of wines are Spanish from many regions. I worked in Barcelona and am very familiar with the cuisine.Some reviews complain it's not like what they ate on the streets in Spain. They don't understand the concept, it's not supposed to be exactly the same, each place, dish is unique. Why do local reviewers always complain about the price? If you can't afford it, don't go. Review the food, service, ambience. The outdoor setting is calm and beautifully tropical. The statutes and light fixtures are unique. This an excellent restaurant run by people who truly care about the dining experience

This Spanish restaurant does one of the best suckling pig, cannelloni and paella. Set at the lovely Dempsey Hill. It won't disappoint.
5
A wonderful restaurant near downtown Singapore. It has been a nice experience to taste some dishes of the catalan cuisine. I suggest to go there and enjoy it. And do not forget to order their catalan ice dessert, together with a cup of sweet wine!
5
Tried this Spanish restaurant for the first time last night. Could have been in Spain. Choice of tapas or a la carte. Servings are not too big and menu not too big. Combination of presentation of the food and the flavours absolutely delicious. Wine list had a very good selection of Spanish wines. Can't wait to go back.
5
I absolutely loved the ambience and dishes at La Ventana Spanish restaurant. Was recommended by my friends to visit the restaurant and I wasn't disappointed at all. The tapas tasted really delicious, especially their signature Canelón which is a must-try dish at the restaurant. We also tried their paella and oven-roasted poularde for the main courses, which were equally tasty and well-cooked. Oh yes, their Crème Brûlée was the best one we ever had in Singapore. Every spoonful melts in our mouths! Definitely a Michelin-star dining experience and would love to return again to try other dishes next time

Let's be clear, I am Catalan, and when traveling around the world, you sometimes miss home, and what way better to get back there than with food? So I decided to go to La Ventana, I have been in all other restaurants from chef Gaig, so I have a nice background about his food. I was not disappointed at all. To all the people saying bad things like "this has nothing to do with Spanish tapas" I will just say something, you are not even Spanish so don't review using your "expertise" in Spanish/Catalan tapas. This is not the typical place you go for tapas in Spain. This is fine food, in tapas format. You won't find a dish full of bad cut, overcooked patatas bravas that you love from Spain. You will find perfectly cooked potatoes, with a signature sauce, and with fine dining amounts. Price of a Michelin starred chef.Go here and enjoy the food they serve, don't compare it with anything else, just go with an open mind for a very special Catalan meal and you won't be disappointed
2
I wanted to share rich Spanish Kitchen with my friend but was disappointed since some of the dishes were far from what I was used to eat in Spain. For example Patatas Bravas were a far cry from any Spanish tapas bar on every street corner in Spain

My husband and I decided to make an exception and sneak out to a little dinner without the kids on a week night. We were pleased to get a booking even though we just rang up the night before.The place looks lovely from the outside and upon entering the restaurant, there was no one to greet us. We had to stand awkwardly for a few minutes before we managed to get someone's attention. We were asked to choose any table we fancied as they were not full that night. It's understandable given that it was a week night. We ordered from the ala carte tapas menu - the Cantabrian anchovies, the strawberry gazpacho with king crab cold soup, the croquetta & cod bunuelos, oyster escabeche, lobster coca, miniature tortilla and the meat balls. Of the tapas ordered, we really enjoyed the anchovies and the tortilla. Actually, everything tasted lovely but those two really suited our palate. We had 2 glasses of draft beer to go along.For dessert, we ordered the Catalan Creme Brûlée and the Torija which was a cameralised brioche with Tahitian vanilla ice cream. Both were really good and just melted into our mouths. Overall, it was a good dining experience and we enjoyed the fact that the place wasn't too crowded. The wait staff was friendly and appropriate. There was a table of businessmen and they were rather noisy. We would have chosen a table outside but we thought a table inside would spare us from the mosquito bites.Just a tiny feedback - the long leather sofa (albeit nice looking) in indoor dining area would need to be cleaned or changed as it does smell very strongly of sweat or something unpleasant. I could be wrong or have an overly sensitive nose but perhaps the management could check it out themselves

I think it's a lovely restaurant. Noisy inside though. Maybe I'll try outside next time. I found myself shouting to be heard during dinner. Have the Gran apat tasting menu. 9 dishes and I would go back for the canelon (this is their famous dish). The rest were ok. For me, that's not a good sign. If there isn't more than 1 dish I would rave about. The wine suggestion was however, really good. But at over $170 per bottle, was a bit expensive. And with the tasting menu, it's a min of two people. I don't know why because that means if I wanted to do ala carte, and there are just two of us, that won't do. And people eating from the ala carte menu - seemed to be getting some really nice food. So if and when I go back, I'll pick something from there instead. The lobster paella was still available. Probably should have gone with our first instincts and done that. It was a pleasant dinner, certainly pricey thoug

I have been waiting to try this Redtaurant given its Michelin starred and must say I was very disappointed. The food was very average and really made me wonder what the hype is all about? The cava sangria was like drinking a sugar syrup. The croquettes ( chicken and Ham) were okay but for that taste there are many other options in town. For vegetarians all you have I spotatie and grilled veg so might as well not bother. The lamb of rack and suckling pig again very mediocre. Would not come back again.
4
There were four of us and we chose to sit inside the air conditioned dining room. We ordered 2 jugs of cava sangria ($75 a jug) and several tapas to share. Service was very friendly and dishes came quite fast that we had to tell the staff to slow down to give us time to savour, drink, and chat.In total we had 9 tapas and the bill came to about $350 excluding wine and before s/c and gst.The food was really good, though the portions were quite small. I suppose this allows diners to try more dishes.We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and absolutely recommend this place
4
Good food in a very nice setting with friendly and attentive service. However small portions and therefore maybe a little on the high end if it comes to price / value. Any ways you should go and enjoy.
4
The restaurant is tucked away in a garden in Dempsey with inside and outside seating. We sat outside and it was very romantic. The food was delicious, some traditional tapas dishes along with some twists.
5
We really enjoyed our dinner, sitting outside and enjoying the delicious tapas. We started with a lovely chilled cava, there is a great wine list (though super pricey). Excellent efficient staff. Food is top notch, a more high end take on tapas. Great setting. My only gripe would be that the food came out way way too quickly. Aside for that it was perfect.
3
The food is delicious. Full stop. Great ham, wonderful paella, great anchovies ..and I can go on.. Flawless food. The waiter was clueless but that's quite normal. Let's not get too upset by this, because you come here to enjoy 1- the decor 2- the food !The bill was about 150 Sing a head and frankly we did not splurge . As a matter of fact, we had 2 desserts only for 6...and no wine ( we brought a bottle ) . Top restaurant for the food and the decor but be ready for the bill. NB, one small note - there was a lot of pressure from the waiters and the lady head waitress to get us to order Because the kitchen was closing . Guys.. This is Sunday lunch and we understand the chef wants to go home, but let's relax ..this is Sunday ..and This an expensive restauran
5
Being from Barcelona and having been several times on the original Can Gaig I went there with a lot of anticipation and overall I was not disappointed. The service was exceptional and the crew dealt very well with my two year old son that is not always easy to please...Food was of good quality and high level presentation. I felt that the Fideua was rather sweet and tasteless but I guess they have adapted to the local tastes. I felt all was one level too low on salt for me. Perhaps will not be a bad idea to ask for more salt and flavor upfront.. Will go again
5
I have dined at La Ventana before. I was here recently and discovered they had a lobster paella, and I had one to try. They use live Boston Lobster for this Paella dish. The lobster broth is used to cook the rice, which imparts a nice flavour to the dish. The lobster is cooked, de-shelled, lobster tail sliced and nicely plated on the pan of paella. Paella is tasty and delicious. Very well done. Best of all, the lobster is de-shelled, so not a messy affair, you only need to just dig in and eat
3
This is a relatively new restaurant in Dempsey. Nice decor, friendly service but I think my average rating is more to do with my choices rather than the quality. We deduced to stick to tapas only - the Iberia jamon was delicious, drizzled with fresh tomato, but the other ones we had were mainly potato and stodgy: the tortilla was undersalted, the Russian salad with tuna, egg and caper was probably the best dish, while the ham croquettes and cod balls were both rather potato-heavy and very deep fried, though nice and crisp. Where were more fishy delights such as ocotpus, gambas and vegetable tapas, like peppers and artichoke hearts? On reflection we should have ordered less tapas and shared a main course, but we really wanted light bites...and all these were a tad too heavy even if well cooked. With 2 glasses of wine each it came to a hefty $180 for two...just for tapas
5
The most amazing thing is obviously the ambience. It overlooks this beautiful greenery area and lighted at night so is wonderful. Service was excellent. The staff were attentive and also I feel they gave us a little extra since we were sharing. Sangria was very expensive on the menu. Otherwise, I know a lot of reviews said the place was expensive but given the other places in Singapore, I felt it was inline with other restaurants in this range. Food was good. Gazpacho was delicious but small portion. Cannelloni again good but one small portion. My favourite starter was definetly the sardines and I enjoyed the scallops main task. I did not like the penne macaroni and cheese - it was too dry. Will come again

My experiences with Spanish food in Singapore thus far do not match up to my barometer which is in of all places, London. Spanish food served at Barrafina and eaten seated at the counter with something cold to drink is the best experience I have had since I have not been to Spain (yet).A friend recommended La Ventana as she said it was the local outpost of a Michelin starred restaurant she'd enjoyed on her trips to Barcelona. I made a solo booking and had a great meal though the food was so rich, it wasn't something I'd eat on a regular basis.A sweet grilled carabiniero prawn was the starting point, after which was one of the restaurant's signature dishes, canelon - a Spanish version of canneloni. The portion is small but because of the richness of the dish, this is all you need. It is stuffed with minced meat and foie gras and cloaked in a creamy truffle sauce. Nice for starter or if you are ordering sharing plates.For the mains I had the pigeon paella which was a pan full of umami laden mushroom bomba rice with a couple of slices of grilled pigeon breast served rare but not bloody. The rice cooked in that flavoursome stock will keep you eating on.My other main was a half portion of suckling pig with crispy skin and a layer of oozy fat, served with an accompaniment of strawberries in a balsamic sauce. The berries worked well to cut through the fattiness of the pork.Dessert was a chocolate cocotte - a molten lava cake made from dark chocolate served in a cast iron pot that contained a thin layer of marmalade underneath, the something sweet to finish a well rounded meal!The restaurant has both outdoor and indoor seating and is located amidst the greenery of Dempsey Hill. It is magical in the evening & is a nice change from the restaurants in the city. Service is professional but not effusive. There a number of staff from Spain so it does feel like being transported to Catalonia! Prices were on the high side so expect to pay around SGD 100 to 120 a person. There are tasting menus that showcase the chef's specialities
4
La Ventana is billed as a Michelin 1 star restaurant! We choose for the Misture of Tapas menus which is price at SGD 108/pax! Stunningly good but the portions could have been at a large scale (Eg. The patatas Bravas came at six pieces (for three persons) only?!)Because of the pleasure my taste buts got, the small porties were soon forgotten! The cazpacho is absolutely to die for, so is the cannelloni in truffel sauce. The location they are at is truly awesome. Do recommend when go there to go and side outside (big fans provide for a comfortable breeze). Total bill ended up in a wapping SGD 500 for 3 pax having the tasting menu of tapas, one coke and a sangria (SGD 68). Do recommend the place but make sure you bring your wallet
1
The tapas were ok but nothing exceptional and our main course (fideuá) was a complete disaster....tasteless.
Spend your money elsewhere if you are looking to enjoy great food.
3
Had dinner there 1st time looking forward to a great dinner but the Tapas was disappointing but least the restaurant ambience is good
4
Set in an old building surrounded by lush greenery in Dempsey, there are both indoor and outdoor dining options. Food is on pricey side but fine and exquisite. I would recommend the iberico ham here as it is very good and generous portion. Other tapas also did not disappoint, with a unique take such as boneless chicken wings, and the prawn. For the mains, I tried the Suckling pig which was done very well with soft tender meat and just the right crisp of the skin. Crime brûlée as a dessert is done different from usual versions with fluff and ice cream. I will personally skip the homemade assorted ice cream though
4
My friend and I dined here on a weekday dinner and opted to go a la carte instead of trying the tapas tasting menu. The ambiance was very nice and we were seated outdoors on a pleasant night with good service.Food was solidly delicious but definitely not mind-blowing. It is on the higher end of prices but expectedly so in Singapore, especially if it is accompanied by wine. I'd recommend the Patatas Bravas, Jamón Ibérico “de Bellota”, Lobster “Coca”, Canelon since 1869 and Catalan Creme Brulee. Other things we tried were the Croquetas and Chicken Wing Confit
5
My friend and I loved every single dish we ordered from the menu. The crispy suckling pig was excellent. My friend does not eat pork much but she stated that this dish is really very good. We thought that the roasted beef and the desserts tasted Oh So GOOD! Definitely worth the trip. You should reserve a table
3
We visited for a Saturday late lunch. We had three tapas and the octopus main to share. The venue is lovely for a weekend meal with friends - it had a nice ambiance. The crowd was quite up market - mainly expats or a well to do crowd. The food however was not as good as we expected. Some tapas was pretty good. Our personal view on the octopus was the sauce was a bit too strong for the octopus.However overall the prices were too high for the food we got especially at lunchtime. A bit disappointing overall.
3
I like the ambience & decor of the place. The tapas were ok, some nice, some ok. But the mains like the paella was only ok. The suckling pig wasn't that great. The beef was not done correctly and we send it back. And when it came, it was worse than the first serving. They apologised and we cancelled it. The mac & cheese was nice. And the desert is nice
5
Surprised to read other recent reviews as we've just enjoyed a beautiful lunch at La Ventana which we booked on the recommendation of the F & B manager at our resort. We enjoyed several tapas dishes, all of which were wonderful. Service was prompt and friendly and the wine list reasonable for Singapore (expensive but then all alcohol is in Singapore). We are regularly visitors to Singapore and Dempsey Hill and are always looking out for new dining options. Will be sure to book dinner at this stylish restaurant when we're in Singapore next year

was a glorious night for dinner last night, just after a light rain and temperature 26C, clear sky, lovely ambience at this new Spanish restaurant in Dempsey, Lovely terrace overlooking a cute garden and the combination of frameless fans and a large blower in the garden make for a cool dining experience. Good service generally but slow food delivery. Pricing high but that is Singapore remember. Wine list interesting and reasonably priced, overall all the things that set you up for a lovely evening. Except the food! we had the Grand Apat tasting menu. nothing exceptional about Tapas no matter what you call it. the ham was very good but that is an off the shelf item so no huge accolades for the chef. Octopus served on a boiled potato with a over-salted and peppered brown sauce which tasted absolutely equal to the Heinz bbq sauce from stores. Except that it had been reduced so was even more disgusting than Heinz. The paella was over-ovened, was cooked to death. Glanced at the couple next to us and their paella was nicely mushy or at least had a teaspoon of liquid in it. Meaning that quality control in the kitchen is poor. The beef tapas had been cooked to death also, mushy so you could eat it with a spoon, i dont know why people do that- Singapore airlines is a prime example. They cook beef to death in stock and the idea is to perhaps feed legions of toothless flyers. The beef is tasteless and all taste now sits in the sauce which is not how we want our food. The canneloni with foie gras and cream sauce was nice but then have you noticed that foie gras can lift any dish out of mediocrity. The last contribution of a dead duck . Anyway, enjoy the outdoors and the nice ambience at Ventana. The food needs to do some chin-ups before i go back ther
4
This new spot is already buzzing on a saturday night and booking is essential.The tapas were good with high quality ham,cod fritters and croquetas.Service was friendly if sporadic.Octupus was tasteless and poorly presented.The one prawn paella had very fishy tasting rice which you would not want much of as it was very rich too.In short a nice place that needs some fine tuning and perhaps could afford proper menus instead of grubby stained pieces of stapled paper.Nearly a winner
