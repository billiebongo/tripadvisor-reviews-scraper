Best Thai food in Yishun Area. It never failed your taste bud. The price is quite cheaper if compare with thai express. I'd like to say it definitely can compare with local food in Thailand. It's worthy to visit.

Went there for a send off lunch. My friend recommended this place for lunch as he loves thailand food. We ordered seafood fried rice, pineapple fried rice, beef, chicken, fish, vegetables, soup etc. All items are prepared with the ingredients imported from thailand. Their ice tea- both red and green are must try items.Food is delicious and the price is very cheap compared to other thai restaurants in Singapore.The seating is limited so the busy hours, need to wait to be seated
