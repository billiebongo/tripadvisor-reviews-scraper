The noodle is not QQ and the Yong Tau Foo is so so and the soup base alot of seasoning.
The Kang Kong add fermented bean curd not so evenly distributed

My favourite yong tofu since young. Love their noodles too. Expect long queue on peak hours. They use mandarin or very limited english to take orders, but if you can't speak mandarin just point to the menu signboard or mention the number on the menu.

If you like a bland taste and simple variety, this is for you. The minced meat on the carbo is what makes it special.

I have always enjoyed this stall Yong Tow Foo. They give you what they have, not for you to select in other stalls. I like because it is just sufficient for me and their soup is tasty.

This hawker stall has been around for ages! I started eating here almost 30 years ago, and it is more commercialised now. Although there would always be a lunch time queue during the weekdays, the queue moves along fairly quickly because they have a "production line" going on. Like the other 2 yong tau foo stalls in this hawker centre, you generally do not get to choose the yong tau foo but the stall will oblige if you do not want (or want more of) any particular item. The food is tasty, and while prices have gone up over the years, it is still value for money

We ordered one set noodle with yong tow foo and one hot plate spicy yong tow foo. Both taste so delicious. The tofu is so soft, and the filling layer is quite thick. The soup taste ok not so much spices inside. The hot plate one is spicy in a good way. We found treasure below the yong tow foo... Egg and mushroom. Price wise is still ok. Definitely recommended and would like to revisit in the futur

With 3.5$ you can have a bowl of tasty noodle with a bit of minced meat and a bowl of soup with yong tau foo inside. Add another 1.5$ ( 5$) to get a healthier choice of adding a small plate of kangkong mix with salted bean paste.The noodle is springy and tasty while the yong tau foo is superb! Tasty and nice ! I give two thumbs up for this food

Visited at beginning of April '14, staff were very freindly and helpful - assisted us in making menu choices despite being busy. the food was good and reasonably priced. We enjoyed being able to sit in nice clean and cool environment too. A good compromise between hawker centre/food hall and posh restaurant. Good central location
