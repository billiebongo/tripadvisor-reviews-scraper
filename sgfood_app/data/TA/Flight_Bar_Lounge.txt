Breathless amazing view to the whole ciry! Close ti the amazing pool is more than an experience that you must have!
4
The view on top of the Marina Bay Sands is amazing to watch the towers and bay at night. The service is not that good. You should be relaxed. Drinks take a while to find the way to your table.
5
Oh my goodness. It is like the Vertigo Bar in Bangkok. Breathtaking view. People are accepting themselves being super important. It is a show and the cocktails are ok, but not more than this. Prices are around sgd 23 per glass.
4
Another great place to have a drink and watch the sunset over looking the city.
The place is busy at that time of nite and very hard to get a seat.
Service was great and so were the drinks.
5
I ordered a cocktail from the top. Very nice cocktails and very good customer service. You also can order food.
3
It's ok but the prices and tourists ruin it and the lack lustre service . It's like black pool . And so not cool
3
This is a place for people to enjoy high-rise view of Garden by the Bay, but the fee is too expensive, I like SuperTree by IndoChine more, which can also enjoy the view with cheaper price

The view is truly astounding and the whole cityscape of Singapore can be seen and felt. No need for air-conditioning despite the sweltering heat we felt at the ground level. Natural air-conditioning by the way of strong and cool winds. Remember to bring a sweater if you're not able to take cooler temperatures and chilly winds.Drinks selections can be improved tremendously and service can be improved as well. When I asked whether a drink is available, the response was, "See if the menu has it". Lacking of Cuban cigars as well and poor selection of cigars. The one we chose was really nice but there are only limited spaces for its smoking.The food was average with good ingredients and overall value was below average for the prices we paid
5
Alcohol is very expensive in Singapore and my cocktail was 23 Singapore dollars,My husbands beer was 20 dollars!.The views were truly awesome and you overlooked the infinity pool on one side.Staff were excellent and it was worth the cost of a few drinks to soak up the atmosphere
3
We dropped in for some snacks and drinks after visiting Gardens by the Bay. The service is fantastic. We were led to a table overlooking the river, next to the infinity pool (partitioned off). But it was hot there with no breeze. Ask for a table overlooking the sea (perhaps closer to the bar) as there was a nice breeze blowing, as we found out on our way out. We ordered the Sky Sling (their version of Singapore sling) which was so so. The Malacca Mojito was too light - I doubt if any rum was added in it. We then ordered the Singapore Sling, but it was not made well. We were quite disappointed with the drinks. In the bites section, there are hardly any options for veg. We ordered the Truffle & Cheese Arancini which was ok.On the plus side, the views were fantastic. And the service by the staff was prompt
5
Very good place to drink and watch the great view of Singapore Marina Bay. Just drink and relax. The staff take some time to bring the drinks but it's not a big deal.
2
Skybar but way to organized and thus lacking any atmosphere. Given table with a bad view. Rest "reserved" but no patronage. View if course nice but comes at a price !
5
Very pleasant, service excellent and view stunning. Can get a little noisy as it fulls up. Excellent range of cocktails well priced but good single malt Macallan scotch very expensive.
4
An excellent view if you can get up there before 11pm and take a walk down the deck, taking in a 360* skyline of Singapore. Drinks are on the pricey side though, however admission is free unlike other rooftop bars.
4
Once you get to the top of tower one, you're welcomed by most polite waitresses. Before you order dinner, make sure you check the prices.
You might as well enjoy an astonishing view while drinking an exquisite mojito, just to name one. Totally worth it.

We made a prior booking so we were allocated an outside seat right on the front edge over looking the city. Here we enjoyed the scenery as the sun set down and lights came on at night which was amazing especially the coloured trees in the botanic garden next door and of course the city. Ordered a drink and some ale carte menu items which were actually plenty to eat. Ordered 3 to share, we were full. The only complaint was when a couple of ladies came out to look at the scenery and started smoking in close proximity dropping their ash in my food. We had to move to a lounge area after that to get away from them
2
on our last day we visited the bar to wait for our pick up we asked to be seated at the edge and was informed its going to rain and if it dose we wont be able to sit in side as it gets full ,i said im not bothered about that but they insisted we sit inside sat down waited about 5 mins no one came to server us so we left so left and when to ce la vie mind not much difference there and way over price
2
What more to say, this is a place everyone wants to go, so the bar by no means to take good care of customers. No reservation? Don't bother to come unless you are willing to stand the whole time as all the customers who sit down will sit for hours
3
I was here a couple of years ago and had a great time so decided to go there again whilst in Singapore. The venue has changed significantly (both in appearance and bar menu) and they have now introduced a cover charge - which admittedly can be used towards drinks.The tables were reserved so were advised that we could only stay for an hour - which we agreed to as we were only there for drinks. As it started to rain we were forced to move inside the lounge area as the outdoor area became too wet for anyone to use. The staff seemed ill prepared to close up the area to prevent the rain from drenching all the patrons - which can't be that rare an occurrence.As a result of the rain we were all crowded into the lounge indoor area where we proceeded to order our drinks. These took a significant amount of time to arrive which, being in a crowded room, was not a great experience.The staff seemed disinterested in tending to customers and in addition to the drinks being overpriced it was overall a poor experience

We went to Flight for New Years Eve. The view is spectacular. We planned a trip months ahead so that we could get reservations. It was late spring/early summer before they had the menu, etc. so they put us on a wait list. They were excellent at confirming reservations and making sure we were seated where we wanted to be seated. If you are going here for NYE consider a couple of things. First, you have to chose to sit inside or outside, If you sit inside you are allowed out on the terrace when it is time for fireworks but it is a very small terrace. The reason to chose indoor seating however, is that it often rains on NYE in Singapore and you cannot move inside if it rains and it is not covered. Second, although the view for the first few fireworks was spectacular the wind blew the smoke our direction and we didn't have a clear view for some of the fireworks. It appeared that the view of fireworks from the floating stage in front of the Mandarin Oriental and the pool platform at the Mandarin Oriental was really the best view for NYE. The restaurant is expensive, as we expected and there were some kind of odd plates that did not fit our taste but other plates that were fantastic. I would go again, in the evening and not on a holiday
4
Love the view while lounging in the deck. cover charge is quite hefty but such an amazing view to have for a night cap!
5
We had new years eve here, the service was first class and the views with the fireworks were superb.
4
This bar is on 57th floor of the landmark Marina Bay Sands hotel. The view is absolutely breathtaking and above there, you are a few degrees below the stuffy heat of the city. Recommend to arrive around 19:00 h, you can then enjoy the 20:00 h light show in the bay. Yes, it is not cheap, like most things in Singapore, but for a tourist landmark the quality food was actually better then expected. Staff was quite friendly and very professional
5
The best view in town yo have a great dinner in the top of the marina bay sands, we were lucky to visit the place, we loved of course the view we had of the hole Singapore town and the pasta we had was simply amazing
5
Took lift to top floor and was welcomed med by friendly and attentive maitre d. A private lounge area on city side was offered for our 6 pax party so long as we spent a minimum of $30 pp. Drinks and food were staple fare but incredibly tasty meaning we had to reorder. Absolutely iconic spot and a beautiful memor

I had a wonderful 2017 Lunar New Year drink and all was decorated with chinese red lanterns and arches. The 20 singapore dolars is redimable for drinks and snacks.The menu is very limited for snaks and we were anticipateing to have a nice selection of Asian food but what was available was very limited and overly priced.There are 2 bars in fact one to the left where you can see the eternity pool and where you can sit on lovely sofas and you have views to the financial district and the other where people who visit the sky park have their entry. The bar on the right is just stand up with tall tables and it was very windy at 6pm. The staff were ok but not over friedly. 1 beer , 1 soft drink and spring rolls will set you back 53 dollars. There is no need to dress up.The entry is on tower 3 and they charge you the cover before you go up.Here are some of the pricing which vary for the time and day of your visit. NON-HOTEL GUESTSApplicable from Sundays to Thursday; 6PM till Midnight.Table for 1-14 Guests -Minimum spend of SGD $30 per person (Mixture of standing & seated)Alternatively, one (1) drink per person applies for all walk in guests, without table guaranteed.Applicable every Friday, Saturday, eve of and on Public Holidays; 6PM till Midnight.Table for 1-5 Guests - Minimum spend of SGD $50 per person Table for 6-9 Guests - Minimum spend of SGD $400 per table (Mixture of standing & seated)Table for 10-12 Guests - Minimum spend of SGD $800 per table (Mixture of standing & seated); Additional SGD$50 per guests for a maximum of 15 GuestsAlternatively, $30++ per person minimum spend applies for all walk in guests, without table guaranteed

Veey good choice for seeing city and bay area from heights. Great drinks and superb service! Even though deck was closed, staff let us visit the deck to see city and marina. They even took pictures of us. Great stories from bar tenders and good atmosphere. Would go there rather than to observation deck
3
This place has a view so it feels as though it can charge a lot for average drinks (we didn't eat up there) by making them a tad pretentious. The view from the shopping centre is just as good as it is up there with the exception of being able to look out over the harbour at the cargo ships and to look down on the gardens by the bay. If you wanna splash the cash on over priced drinks and food then it's the place for you but not worth it if you are on a budget.
5
We were a party of 4 adults and a child and turned up without booking ,but were very lucky that they found us a table on the balcony with fabulous panoramic views of Singapore but we only had an hour because the table was reserved . We could however have had a standing table with no time restriction.There was an Interesting snack menu and the food was beautifully presented.We walked around the extensive deck watching the panoramic view change from daytime to twinkling lights.A highlight of out visit to Singapore, but booking recommended if you prefer to sit down. We had to spend a minimum of 30 dollars per adult, which wasn't difficult.
5
WoW!I got told about this place, and advised that I hadn't experienced Singapore properly unless I checked this place out!Great advice!You buzz up to the 57th floor of the amazing Marina Bay Sands hotel, and once there, your breath is taken away the incredible views.I mean this is truly the business!The bar is nicely situated to take advantage of this, especially if you sit outside on the terrace, which I did.The incredible sights from that height are a photographers dream, and if you take a wander along the full extent of the terrace, you will have many a vista to choose from.The bar has three versions of the iconic Singapore Sling to choose from.I thought I would try something a bit off centre, and ordered a signature Straits Sling, a drier version of the original!Absolutely fabulous, to coin a phrase!I would love the recipe, because it was one of the most delicious drinks I have ever tasted!In the daytime, this bar has great views of the harbour and all the myriads of ships and skyscapes over the city.At night, it is a wonderland. Truly breathtaking!It is not cheap, but why should it be with all these advantages, but prices are not exorbitant by any means. The staff are wonderful by the way!If you are visiting Singapore, do yourself a favour and check this place out!I guarantee you won't be disappointed
5
Went here (rooftop bar) on a Thursday evening for a Singapore sling. Drink really good (about $20!), stunning views of downtown singapore. Staff were excellent with our 2 year old son and we had a great time watching the sun set!
5
Great place to see the whole of Singapore and watch the word go by. Food is great as well and always tons of atmosphere from people watching
5
We stayed at the Marina Bay Sands so was a good choice to enjoy cocktails in an evening up in the fiight bar 57 floors above ground level. We arrived during the Christmas promotion 12 cocktails for a free bottle of champagne, we unfortunately didn't make it too 12 due to flying. Not a cheap location, but professional and nice atmosphere. We throughly enjoyed the bar and the manager made us very welcome every night. The hotel is very good and one evening we were due Storms and rain and they closed the outside area to stop any customers getting wet and moved all inside. Well worth a drink - 10/1
5
its a nice place...the vibe is very nice and calm. you can enjoy some great view from the top. Since we are vegetarians there were only two options in quick bites.. We ordered truffle and cheese arancini - which was excellent and veg crudites - which was ok. since we were very hungry we decided to move out to eat elsewhere. overall the place is great to spend some nice time

If you want to go to the rooftop of the Marina Bay Sands hotel then you can't go past trying the Flight Bar & Lounge. Sure there's a $30 minimum spend per person however the alternative is spending $23 and going to the Skypark Observation Deck. Go around late afternoon before sunset when it gets busier. We found the staff really welcoming even if we were a little worse for wear after walking around Singapore for most of the day - got shown a table overlooking the marina. They even didn't have a problem showing us a better table when I asked to be moved away from the table of smokers next to us. The Singapore Sling ($24), which came with a complimentary Foie Gras Xiao Long Bao, was perfect, better than the original at the Raffles Hotel. Beers are more expensive here than other places ($16-20) but cold, refreshing and came with complimentary mixed nuts. They provide a good selection of quality bar bites from the Sky on 57 restaurant. The view is well worth the price and you won't find it hard to achieve the minimum spend

Loving cocktails and views and staying at Marina Bay Sands for a weekend, visit of flight bar was a must. I made a reservation by mail (although the website says you have to do by phone, of course this was perfectly fine) for the "sunset promotion" consisting of a Singapore Sling and a piece of Xiaolongbao with foie gras, which both was good. Also the cocktails we had afterwards were solid craftsmanship, if not outstanding cocktail art you can find at dedicated cocktail places.We got a nice table directly at the railing with perfect city view. Even when all tables were full, the (not too big) bar was not too crowded to be uncomfortable. Complements to management for not exaggerating the limited space (like they do at Ritz-Carlton Hong Kong's Ozone Bar at 118th floor)! Also service was friendly and attentive.Prices are round about 26 S$ per drink incl. tax and fees.If you make a reservation chose the time about half an hour or an our until sunset, so you can enjoy both, the day an night view
5
You absolutely need to be here! This place provides the unmatched view of infamous Singapore skyline! It is on 57th floor which is itself very fascinating! The people are very warm and very chilled out! Go here instead of the observation deck because one drink and ticket of observation is same! We had beer and Singapore sling which was amazing
4
Our last evening in Singapore included dinner at Flight. We had an early reservation so the restaurant was not packed. Our staff was very attentive and checked and replaced anything from fresh dinner rolls & butter to our drinking water.The meals and Singapore Sling's were excellent and served with grace and care.Its a great way to finish your visit to Singapore
5
We visited here while in Singapore for the Grand Prix and got a table just before sunset. We were able to sit and watch the sunset and then the lights come on around the track.It was the first time I'd ever had a Singapore Sling and it was the perfect setting with the most magnificent view.The staff weren't terribly friendly, and the one staff member who chattered to us and was answering our many questions was chastised by the manager. I feel really sorry for causing her trouble

Visited the flight bar with family (two adults, two teens) at the end of an afternoon's sightseeing around Marina Bay. Came up to look at the view (obviously) but this is difficult as the pool area on one side is for hotel guests only, so we tried - with little confidence as we weren't smartly dressed - for entry to the Flight Bar. Surprised to be allowed entry but as the place was practically deserted, realised this was probably because they were desperate for custom. Strangely, we were only allowed standing space around a high topped table, despite the empty lounging space throughout the bar. Then, waitress insisted that each of us order a drink (my daughter didn't want a drink) as there is a minimum spend for the highly prized view. Not a problem as such but given that the place was practically empty, it seemed odd to not offer us proper seats and think they should make the minimum spend policy clear at the outset. Staff also a little off-hand and rushed over when we asked someone else to take a photo of us - as if we had transgressed in some way. Who knows? This is Singapore, so maybe there is some unwritten rule! Overall, didn't feel welcome and wouldn't recommend, regardless of the view
5
This is a great spot to look back over at Singapore and appreciate the architecture of the city. The cocktails list is quite nice, as is the Whiskey selection. I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent up top.
5
Thanks Michael. Your team at Flight57 were super attentive. My every need was cared for, from entering the premises right through to leaving the deck.
Oh yes, jamming on my Circuit was good fun too!
I will be back again.
5
Delicious bar bites,amazing view, great service, awesome experience.Not as pricey as we would have expected given the magnificent marina bay experience
2
Went to this place whilst in Singapore with my husband, we were staying in one of the other 5 star hotels the mandarin oriental but compared to that the staff at this bar at the marina bay sands hotel gave very poor service, we ordered a few drinks and some appetisers, they took 45 minutes to bring out our appetiser and weren't even apologetic as to the fact they had delays in the kitchen. They were very rude, unpleasant and we did not feel welcome at all. The views are spectacular however the poor service really ruined our experience
5
We came here for drinks. Two drinks each with service came to a long way north of S$100. It is not a place to grab a cheap drink! But we loved it. Great views, lovely staff, not overly busy. We had an outside table, and after a while the staff offered to move it over to the edge of the seating area so we could see out. And it is a great view.A really, really fun night. I would definitely come back here again if I was in Singapore
5
I have to agree with others on here that you should come here for a drink and the views instead of paying fot the observation deck. You can jump in a lift from tower one up to floor 57 for free to see the wonderful view over Bay Gardens at night. We then decided to go for a drink at Flight Bar which was expensive but worth it! We only had the one drink and watched the light shows whilst sat outside on the deck. Dress code didn't seem too bad, people in shorts and trainers.
5
Took fellow TripAdvisor advice and did the Flightbar for drinks instead of the tour--Amazing! Got right in and treated very well. Amazing views. You can walk all around. Go to ground level for 8 or 9:30 laser light show. 15 min and not to be missedBar was not crowded or snootyServers very sweet. Compliments to the management
5
We were advised by friends to not pay out for the observation sky park deck, instead go to flight bar (on the same level) and put the money towards a drink....and it was a great recommendation.Flight is located in tower 1 (which is the right hand side of marina bay sands) and opens at 6. If you don't have a reservation I'd recommend going early to get a good seat. We had a view towards the Fullerton and CBD and was spectacular as the sun was setting! Yes the drinks aren't cheap (cocktails were S$22-32) but they were top notch and in a beautiful setting, so a good holiday treat. The Singapore Sling and French Gin cocktails were the stand outs.The bar staff were also very attentive and friendly.
4
Another repeat visit for a special occasion. The venue does not disappoint great cocktail menu with good snacks. The service is exceptional and don't forget the view. Make sure you book and ensure you get a great table. Enjoy the evening sit back and soak it all up
4
My friend and I went during a weekday with the intention of having a drink or two and watching the sunset. We certainly weren't disappointed. From the fantastically fast elevator ride up to the top, the friendly staff who seated us and the delicious cocktails we then sipped while watching the sun go down and the city light up, the views were fabulous. I would definitely recommend for anyone going to Singapore. The downside is it's very expensive. That said alcohol in Singapore is very expensive anyway and if you're going to spend that much it might as well be 57 stories up
5
went to the bar at the top and it was an amazing view,the beers were an unbelievable price though,i think they were around 25 aussie dollars each but trust me you can't go to singapore and not do it
5
This 57th floor lounge is a fantastic venue for sunset drinks. Drinks are somewhat more expensive than elsewhere but delicious and well worth it even before the superlative views are taken into account. Service is friendly and attentive. Highly recommend.
5
We were recommended to go for drinks at Spago and as they had a private function, we went to Flight bar instead. Exceptional views of the city and based on the location, the wines were reasonable and the staff were friendly and helpful.
5
Flight Bar and Lounge gives you the option of eating formally or on the edge of the building with an amazing view. We had planned to eat in the restaurant. While waiting for a table, we had a drink outside and reviewed the menu to match. We cancelled our dinner reservation to enjoy the lovely weather and a menu that was charming. I couldn't fault the service of the staff.
4
We were not guests at the hotel, but visiting the bar was a good opportunity to get to the top and enjoy the view.I had a great self composed version of of Singapore Sling. Tasty and VERY well presented.The staff was very serviceminded and made us feel welcome. The price for drinks was expensive, but worth the experience
4
The place is great just for the view but add in a few drinks and its a fantastic place. Go with friends or with guests the service is good, the snack and drinks menu is just what you are looking for. If you want a seat make sure you book. Enjoy
5
Don't bother with the viewing tower, head straight up here and make a night if it. Not an extensive choice of cocktails but they are good either way. Good bar snacks too. Views are outstanding. Head up here and stay for the light show at 20:00 loca
4
We weren't guests of the hotel but decided to go up to Flight Bar as drink prices looked pretty comparable to the option of buying tickets to be observation platform. We were seated in the front corner just about giving us a view over the bay and in time to catch the end of the light show. In the end we spent about an hour and a half enjoying cocktails and the view. The view is not the most spectacular as view of most of the city is blocked by the office buildings in front. But the view of the bay is fine
4
I was pleasantly surprised by the Flight Deck, the food and service. While we werenâ€™t staying at the Marina Bay Sands we did taxi it over and after a bit of a search we discovered the elevators on Tower 1. Up to the 57th floor and we were greeted at reception and seated right away. We decided to remain outside rather than the enclosed lounge. We had a nice meal and the beer was cold. Nothing compared to the 270-degree view of the city
5
Perfect spot for a late afternoon drink and even better if you make it linger into the evening! See the cityscape and Singapore Strait transform from day to night with delicious cocktails and cold beer. We also had a storm pass by just after dark which was amazing to watch as well! Cocktails were beautiful, service couldn't be faulted. Food available although we didn't eat. Only small disappointment was that they still allowed smoking in some parts of the outside bar but we just moved. Don't expect cheap drinks but it's worth the experience
