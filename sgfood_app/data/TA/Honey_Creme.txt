Nothing fancy and the portion is so small for the price. You can try it but not likely to purchase it again

I chose the dark chocolate flavor.
SGD 5.50.
They sell drinks too other than ice cream. Limited seating. The exit door is at the back.

I was here with my 3yo daughter and she loves the cotton candy ice cream. I was expecting more than just ice cream and cotton candy on top, but she loved it.

The ice cream here is rich, thick and creamy, we found that one sundae fed the whole family of 5 as it was so sweet. The kids particular loved the cotton candy topping or the caramel popcorn, worth a visit, expensive and definitely share!

The desert here are good especially the ice cream is very nice and creamy. Especially like the one with candy floss, it gives you that fairy feeling.

After months of lemming, finally I got to try the Honey Creme soft serve. My husband ordered the Tiramisu & I an Affogato (which I highly recommend). The selection of toppings to choose from is amazing and glad I got something nice the first try. Will definitely come back for more. Love this place <3P.S- In case you find it hard locating it, it's just near the 313 Somerset taxi stand

Oh my goodness! I wanted a special treat today and I saw a sign for Honey Creme, so I thought I'd check it out. They have a really cool menu of interesting soft serve ice creams with toppings ranging from cotton candy to turkey bacon (or both!). It's nice because portion sizes are reasonable, so you feel indulged but not overstuffed. What I liked most, though, was seeing the staff interact with a very young boy who was- very oddly- there alone. The boy must be there alone quite often because he called the staff his "friends", and the girls working there were masterful at providing great customer service to the paying customers while still giving the little boy some of the attention he was clearly craving. It's rare for ice cream to warm your heart, but my stop at Honey Creme did just that!

Since we're tourist we don't really know the area of this place so we spent nearly an hour to find it, because it's located outside mall near taxis. We were really tired, quite sluggish as well but rejuvenated by the yummy-ness of the ice cream. We tried pop corn, honey comb, and comb honey. All very delicious! And not too pricey. The server (or the owner?) too is very polite and helpful, the interior is good. Really boost me up!Will I come back here if I visit Singapore again?YES

I went to this place yesterday after my late lunch. I ordered ;- Original Milk Ice Cream cone => soft serve milk ice cream here was so sweet. Really too much sugar in it. And I barely smell any milk aroma in it. Taste just like a cheap one /Cone wasn't handmade like other Korean soft serve here using.. This place use cheap chewy cone and tasteless plus the tips on bottom was broke.. Leaking every where. For 4.90$ this can't call that worthy for money or my daily calories. Mini Macarons tried 2 flavor which was pistachio and Raspberry both were again too sweet for shells, butter cream in the middle were full of sugar.. No aroma or else. Not impressed with the quality here.

I visited the jem outlet...i read from reviews that the gula melaka soft serve ice cream is the best..thought sg50 there should be some promotion however there isnt any.the light green soft serve is soft but not sweet.thought i piped in whole tube of gula melaka...little toppings only.for the price of 6 dollars i believe i deserve a better ice cream...most likely my one and last visit
