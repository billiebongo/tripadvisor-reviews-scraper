Loved the peach and burrata and the duck ragu pasta was memorable. Tomato salad was completely underwhelming - bit of a rip off to pay so much for what was essentially tomato with olive oil.
5
What a great place— great place, food, service- limited but incredibly tasty menu. Expensive but worth it
5
New year lunch at our favorite restaurant in Singapore
We love seatied at the counter to see them prepare our food
Sea Urchin was superb as always and Burrata was excellent
Good to start year 2018
5
Our group of six had a great time. Excellent food and value for money. Fantastic 7 course dinner for the money.
5
Excellent ambiance and great food make for a fantastic time. Lolla is never too crowded and the basement seating is nice and cozy. Phone reception does suck downstairs which is also a great encouragement to leave your phones alone and talk to your date / friends.

We visited for brunch with our little 2 year old foodie - because who says you can't eat nice food with kids. The restaurant called beforehand to warn us they didn't have child seats - which was fine. Our daughter sat at the bar and loved watching all the nice uncles cook her lunch. Everyone was super sweet to her. Our waiter even made sure to delay our daughter's ice cream until we had finished the mains.We ALL loved the food - everything was delicious.

Went here last night and the food was well priced and delicious. We went for the 7 course menu and the portions were very good and generous. I have eaten in far more expensive places that werent as good. Well done to Lolla. Happy to recommend i
1
To be honest the food is nice but too small, this is clearly overpriced!!! We paid SGD 250 for 2, we had the 3rd or 2nd cheapest bottle of wine, cold cults, avocado kind of salad , pork collar and tuna tartare (which is a joke, so little...). Anyway I won’t recommend it
4
Great experience as usual. We made reservations (although restaurant was hardly full on a monday night), sat at the counter and ordered the sea urchin pudding, olives, beef tongue, grilled octopus and their duck confit pasta (a special). We liked everything except the olives. Bill came up to about s $160 without drinks.
5
Love the ambience! Good for small group, be it for business or families. Cosy feeling and full of privacy if you only want to mingle within your own group gathering! Great food and good wines! Excellent services! The dishes were done very well and they are all healthy selections
4
Squid ink pudding, topped with tons of uni. Quite shocked when they served since portion is very small (too small for sgd40ish price). But, when I tasted it, this is extremely worth for my money! recommend!
4
It was my first visit to Lolla and I was pleasantly surprised. It's a great place for a casual lunch meeting with a nice selection of wines and good food.
5
Had a awesome meal last night, great dishes and very well prepared! Favoursome! Great concept of sharing !! Get to try more dishes !!
4
The food was good, but not outstanding. There are so many similar restaurants that the food really needs to be spectacular. Service was amazing though!
5
Good food, excellent service - what more can one ask for - and the ability to watch the chefs in action to boot.
5
My family and I always love the food here. The ambience is good & relaxing and the staffs are always friendly.Here they serve tapas. After all it's a Spanish restaurant. We love the burrata cheese with plum & honey. The combination is just perfect. Creamy, crunch, sweet and smooth. The duck fat potato is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside while the gratinated leek fondant is fragrant and good mouth feel. The Cinco Jotas hamon Iberico de Bellota is yummy too. The staffs will also recommend the special dish of the day.
3
Went there with friends on Saturday evening.We were in the big table in the basement.The concept of sharing plates was not as expected as portion were too small.The main courses were tasty but too costly as no side dish was included in the plate. For instance i had monkfish with a little sauce and a little salad... nothing more. When you pay 29$ for a plate you expect some more.We tried the cheese platter for 6 but was just too small.... it was quite ridiculous.But, wine was really good.Shame I wonâ€™t recommend this restaurant to my friends
4
Had dinner again at Lolla, it was the sea urchin , delicious, this and a glass of wine is all I wanted! I guess I did not need much persuasion to share the other dishes. A great meal and Marco took very good care of us 
5
Had sea urchin pudding, grilled avocado, sour dough with butter and doughnuts with lemon curd from the regular menu as well as hand torn pasta with crab meat from the special menu. All of them were very good and freshly prepared by the chef in front of you. Will visit again
5
Had a chance to try the 7-course tasting menu. At $100 per person, I thought it was an excellent deal. The Chef may have found his stride. The dishes (other than the sea urchin pudding which remains delectable as usual) were tasty, well executed & had some lovely surprises. I loved especially the chanterelle with bean sprouts, aged Manchego cheese & mushroom jus. Who knew taugay could be so elevated? The fig & pear galette dessert was also a delicious delight, since you get to watch them make it, bake it and then eat it straight out of the oven
5
Was not disappointed. Enjoyed the creative dishes. Tge uni was fantastic. Recommend you share so that you can taste other excellent dishes.
2
Make reservation on the same day at 6.30pm but was told that diners only allow to finish dining withing two hours.
There was no confirmation call up from Lolla.
4
A group of three of us went to Lolla last night, really fun little place, staff are great and the food is excellent. A couple of dishes I felt lacked a little bit of flavour but overall the food was very good. Sitting at the bar watching the chefs do their stuff is fun and I would definitely recommend asking the chef about the specials of the day and trying those.
3
Situated in popular bar area near China, Lolla serves sort fushion food which was okay. Portions are tiny, price "normal". We 3 pac with 4 small plates, 1 main of lamb chop (3 slices), 1 dessert, 1 beer + 1 wine = US$190 Fortunately none of us was hungr
5
There are so many Michelin stars in Singapore these days, navigating around our island for good grub is truly a dazzling experience. But, finding nice restaurants that deliver consistency, at good value... That's like finding a needle in a haystack. So if you're here for a couple of nights, can't be bothered to burn your money on over-hyped stars, go to Lolla. Get the 7 course tasting menu. Every. Dish. Stunning. Even the bread served with kombu butter was divine. We couldn't stop. The uni pudding on a spoon was creamy and savoury to start the dinner on the right note. I also was a big fan of the sea brill with salmon roe. Though the hand torn pasta with crab meat that followed, filled me up very quick. (Not that I could stop eating it for the life of me!) I'd highly recommend that you choose the sous vide beef short ribs over the pigeon for mains. So beautifully soft and tender, you would think that it was made in a brisket. And the dessert of fig and pear galette was so buttery and flaky and comforting as it melts in your mouth. And great value in this town at a mere $100++. You'd be rolling out of the restaurant, and yet I'd still recommend you order the steamed dark choc pudding on top of the 7 courses.. It is oozy and gooey and a sin to pass on if you're a fan of chocolate. You can either sit by the bar where the chefs prep and cook. Or you can sit at the communal table in the basement. Both have a chill vibe, and honestly.. I've never had a bad meal here. But now with the tasting menu, you're guaranteed a really good one
5
My third visit first time on dinner timeWe went to th basement but I prefer the ground floor but it was okThe food was spectacular All the dished we ordered was excellent although this time we did not order our favorite sea urchinThis is the one and only Lolla Good selection of wine as well最高に良いレストランで
5
Have Patronised Lolla since they lolla first started out years back. Glad to have met up with Lolla Owners Thadeus and Pang Hiang Tee again when hosting dinner for my colleagues. The food is good and with a fine selection of wines and champagnes. It never goes wrong to host a meal at Lolla. We Actually most of their signature delicious taps dishes can’t list them all. But the pictures will do the talking. Lolla now have a champagne bar at their basement
4
The place is lovely and the environment is charming.Food is absolutely delicious and the staff very nice and helpful. I won't talk about price because in all Singapore restaurants are not for budget. I had a great night and I would advice it to a friend who stops by here for holiday. Only "remark" (but it is not really one) is that the place is quite tight
5
This little gem was quite well hidden and didn’t look like much from outside. My friends and I sat at the bar and were able to see the chefs in action. The menu was quite adventurous so I had someone order for me. Every single dish was amazing. We had mushrooms and beans-sprouts, which were rich and nutty. We had beef with potato gratin and egg yolk which was sensational! The beef fell apart in my mouth, it was so flavoursome. We also had some tomatoes, bread, salad and pigeon. Each dish was amazing and because they all came one at a time, it gave you the time to fully appreciate each dish. It was such a treat and I will recommend it to anyone who will listen
5
A group of us went here recently for dinner, it is tapas with a difference - good sized portions and you can sit and watch the food being prepared in the open kitchen. The food is excellent, different and of very high quality. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There is a great selection on the menu. Especially good dishes are: the Sea Urchin Pudding, Grilled Avacado, Tuna Belly Tartare and the Duck Rillette. They also have a great selection of wines although they tend to be expensive. Overall a fantastic enjoyable experience. The puddings are great Well worth a visit if you are in Singapore
5
Been to Lolla 3 times now and they never disappoint! Perfect date spot for 2 especially when you sit at the counter.
5
One of the best spanish tapas in singapore! Exceeded my expectations! Highly recommended and not so expensive!
5
Went for a birthday dinner and would definitely be back. Great food, wine list and they gave us a free desert for the birthday girl. Quiet on a weeknight.
5
Beneath this dimly lighted and seemingly quiet restuarant, lies an attentive waiting staff and a delightful menu. The food is decently priced for the amount of effort took to create them! Definitely worth every penny. My partner and I will definitely be back for their Omakase men
5
Based on other review sites, I estimated the cost for two for dinner with drinks to be around 180SGD. However, we ended up spending only around SGD100 for appetizer, main course and non-alcoholic beverages. The portion sizes are small but filling. The Sea Urchin Pudding was a 5 on 5. The Duck Rillette a 4/5 and the Beef Tongue Escalope a 4/5 - tender and well-done. Service was amazing - staff were cordial and efficient.Most of the seating at the restaurant is communal or at the bar. Since we went for a weekday dinner and the communal table just had two groups at each end of the table, we still had quite a bit of privacy. The cafe decor is simple, homely and beautiful
4
Tried lunch at Lolla on a weekday with LGF and it wasn’t as busy as I thought it would be. Got a nice table of our choice facing the kitchen so we could see what the chefs were making. Menu wise, Lolla keeps it simple with a small variety on offer. This is good as it helps the kitchen focus on making these dishes better while the simplicity helps with churning out food quickly. Lolla serves its food tapas style but the portions are decently sized...not the Spanish sizes that you would expect tapas to usually be.Tried the sea urchin pudding which was an absolute delight. Never had anything that tasted like the pudding before which made me ask the restaurant manager, Wandi, what it was. Anyway, it was made with squid ink and we loved it. The grill octopus was pretty interesting and the spicy sauce it came with gave it a nice Smokey flavor and a bit of heat. The hand torn pasta with crab meat we really enjoyed too. The chocolate pudding for dessert is a must. The bitterness of the dark chocolate contrasted so well with the cold and sweet vanilla bean ice cream. I’m not usually a dessert person but I was sold on this one. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience made perfect by the person I was with. The chefs and restaurant manager were nice and friendly. Check out the pictures which were amazingly well taken.
4
Slightly surreal to find myself eating tapas in Singapore but I went at the whim of the host and the food was excellent. Sitting downstairs in the cool cellar was a relief after a hot walk. The wine list had a good, varied selection and the service was prompt. Not sure it would be my first choice in Singapore given all the food options but if you are craving tapas, go for it
4
Went with 2 friends and was served some warm brown bread with konbu butter - always a good start to a meal.What followed was a Grilled Octopus, a half portion of Sea Urchin Pudding and also crab pasta.The crab pasta seemed a bit like a dry alio oglio but tasted nice nevertheless.The pudding itself was delicious and so flavoursome, we later found out it was made from squid ink, egg yolks, cream, topped with sea urchin and chives.Happy to return to try their other dishes (my first time was for lunch, which was just as good).Besides eating in small groups, it's also a suitable place to take your date and you'll find the service to be friendly and accommodating too
5
Lolla is a restaurant that I always rely on - the mood - food and interior always works. Whether for a couple dining at the open kitchen, or 8 friends downstairs at the communal table - it is always consistent, flavoursome and a meal I look forward to.Highlights for me on the menu are the grilled avocado and tomato salad. The duck fat potatoes have to be eaten again and again.The concept is around sharing - so vegans and meat eaters alike are well catered to.A special highlight for me is to arrive and order immediately the duck rillette. Sip a great glass of red, and sit back and enjoy a great meal. The Quinta do Vale Meat Douro is my pick! I dine there at least once a month and recommend all our friends to go a regular dinner there when I'm craving a fix!Dont overlook Lolla on your visit to Singapore
5
Returning for another visit on a Sunday, one of the view restaurants open around Ann Siang Road, the ever-consistent Lolla did not disappoint.My local friend and I perched at the bar and entertained ourselves with great food and watching the staff humming along in the kitchen.The fennel and citrus salad followed by fresh tomatoes in a sherry vinegar dressing were delightfully refreshing.The beautiful brussel sprouts and then the grilled quail were delightful.To top off the night, the soft dark cacao fondant in a ramekin with wicked ice cream was heaven on a plate - superb
5
First time here in about three years, but very pleased to see standards have maintained. Really cooperative and helpful staff, too. The Crema Cataluna was probably the highlight - but it's basically all good.
5
Pasta truffie crunchy is amazing, the whiskey and wine menu is very completed. Was a great experience
4
Been here a few times & as always, I like the food here. Good portion, tasty food, friendly staffs. Be here again...
4
I like the food and the service here.
Everything here is good except I find the ambience a little too dark for my dining comfort.
Recommended to try.
5
every single dish was absolutely delicious. All hits, no misses! Can't wait to come back again. One of the best meals so far this year.
4
First time to go to lolla's. Food was great and i want to come back to order the other items. Place is small so must book if you want to go there.
5
This short menu, open kitchen, heaven sent restaurant has been my favourite for about 3-years now. Small plates in a Tapas style never fail to excite and deliver euphoric moments of great taste and culinary surprise. There are classics on the menu, grilled avocado, grilled octopus, leek fondant, beef tongue, duck fat potatoes, lamb chops, burnt lettuce, tomato salad, lemon curd donuts... ooooooh take me back now!They serve an excellent and well priced Douro wine, which I recommend.The specials menu written up on the chalk board above the welcome desk is always worth an adventure, especially if you're a regular to this excellent restaurant. You can't RSVP for the bar seating, so be prepared to put your name down and then go for a drink round the corner, but any wait is worth it.This place is very, very special, and well worth the visit. I can't wait to go back again.
4
We had the uni pudding, burrata, beef short ribs, duck fat potatoes and sourdough toast with kombu butter. Besides the duck fat potatoes, which was a little underwhelming, everything else was good, in an uncomplicated sort of way. Thumbs up for the friendly and attentive service crew too.:
4
this store opens at 6pm. the staff offered us two seating choices, the counter chairs or the basement room. chose the basement which look so classy and has a very cool temperature. orders came very fast. orders are in small portions and can be shared! grilled avocado is mouth watering as well as the grilled octopus. i havent tried the sea urchin as im scaredbut the doughnut with lemon curd is crisp and just heavenly .. staff are super friendly and attentive
5
Excellent restaurant and service. Small menu accompanied by daily suggestions. Best place to sit is on the bar (where it all happens). We had bread + tomato dip, their famous sea urchin, steak tartar (best ever), calamares and some vegetables. Please note that in return of the high quality the prices are on the same level..
5
For the third time in 10 days, this time for dinner and not lunch, I visited Lolla. Great food and great ambience. It's a shame that I only discovered the restaurant now, just before leaving Singapore after three great years.
4
The menu style and the food was really creative and tasty. However, unless they change their menu frequently so that I get to try their new dishes, I wouldn't go there too often because it's kind of pricey.
5
This is our second time! It was as amazing as our first visit! Will definitely head back there again!
4
Revisit for lunch after two years, order a scallop, sea urchin pudding, razor clams, and roste pork.
Everything was nicely prepared and tasted excellent and definitely worst visiting again.
5
Her Sea Urchin Pudding has never failed to provide the very pleasure of savouring orgasmic concoction of Uni and complementary black pudding (mix of tomato, egg and squid ink), elevating one's senses to 7th heaven. Half-portion is more than enough to satisfy. At S$28, it's a steal. Good thing we were controlled, ordering only a Fennel salad and Iberico pork collar. Going early, 12 noon and being the first made a difference in the ambience and service. Simply love this place, so unpretentious and pure. A teetotaler, heard from friends that Lolla is famed for her cocktails too. Must try their Sunday brunch soon
5
The signature dish, Urchin Pudding is really a genius creation. The texture, taste, everything was just perfect! Must visit Lola for that. At the same time, the others dishes were averagely good only, some not that worthy considering the price, such as Iberico Pork Collar. It's like 5-6 slices of pork collar meat, cooked to just nice medium, with some sauces, for $29++. Beef tongue was good while I guess would be better if you charcoal grill instead of stew, to make it more chewy. Atmosphere was lovely, service was professional and attentive, Chef team was great fun to talk to. Order your dishes wisely and you'll have a good night :
5
We loved the open kitchen concept, attentive staff and above all else; the food. We started with the sour dough bread and Kombu butter, absolutely delicious. Steak, seared to perfection (better than any we have had in high end steak restaurants, and paid considerably more for) lamb rack, again faultless. Both dishes complimented with fantastic sides...highly recommend the duck fat potatoes. Wine is also at a reasonable price. We will definitely be returning in the near future.
5
My friend and I came here for their weekend brunch and it was fantastic. We were seated downstairs in a corner of the communal table which was quite nice as it was quiet down there and since the table didn't fill up during our meal it ended up being very private and a lot more peaceful than the upstairs counter seating. The service we had was excellent, our waiter (Marcos I believe) was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, and the recommendations he made were spot on as far as the food went. He was also very attentive, refilling our water and checking on our enjoyment of the meal throughout. And the food was exceptional. Every dish we had was delicious and impeccably prepared. The highlights for me were the toasted sourdough with hazelnut spread, rhubarb preserves and ricotta, which was absolutely divine, and the sinfully indulgent bacon steak, which were well seasoned and grilled to perfection, and complimented by the creamy peas on top. And of course their famous lemon doughnuts, which were light and fluffy, almost croissant-like in the centre, and served with a perfect lemon curd. Overall we had a fantastic experience, both in terms of food and service. And while the prices may seem a bit high we felt they were reasonable for the quality and portion of food received. I'm already planning a return visit for dinner
5
So we were looking for a happy hour joint before heading over for a meal at the gorgeous Cheek by Jowl and stumbled across Lolla. Hmmm, interesting menu. Spanish tapas. Similar to Esquina. We ordered just a grilled octopus starter to share with a glass of wine each. Impressive! Succulent sous vide octopus grilled to perfection! We loved it and vow that we will return for the acclaimed sea urchin pudding and the other mouth watering selections at a later date!
4
I don't even know where to start.Everything is just so good. It's a bit pricey but it's penny well spent when you have friendly servers who know their menu well, and great food to make your day.MUST-TRIES:Squid Ink PuddingBread with Konbu ButterLamb Chop
5
Food is really delicious and all items on the menu looks interesting. The uni pudding was awesome though a bit pricy, but still worth a try.
Service provided is good as well. Feels welcomed and comfortable.
4
great place for dinner with friends! love the little sharing plates portions where we can share and try many different dishes. highly recommended!
5
That glorious squid ink pudding - the foil to the creamy, delectable uni fern after fern perched delicately on top.
Like nothing else you've eaten - satiation is guaranteed.
3
The food is just ok... a bit overpriced..
Scallops are not the freshest. I don't feel the food worth the money
4
Always found the service excellent & friendly. Really like this place for a casual lunch & their 12 seater dining table downstairs is perfect for a group of friends .
5
Squid ink pudding with Uni was heavenly.... makes you go Mmmmmm..... with each mouthful. Fatty tuna tartare was by Far the best tartare of any sorts I have tried.Scallops carpaccio is so sweet and freshOf course, must try the toasted sour dough with Japanese seaweed butter - so simple and yet so addictive !! Danger sign for those trying to cut carbs.... irresistible!Flame seared Hamachi was done just right ! Spot on!!
4
They have a great kitchen chefs, happy people, playful and funny. It was a leisure seated at counter, to see them having fun in their work, making fun of each other and yet preparing, cooking and serving up great dishes. Counter seats gives you a view on their open kitchen and it's chef's showmanship with it's tempo. It is great
5
They only have three cocktails in their menu (they primarily serve wines), and they were all really good. The food was also lovely. The duck rillette is rich, it needs to be shared. The grilled octopus is delicious. The ambience is casual, but it is best to arrive after the sun has set. The mood feels weird when sunlight hits their cozy interiors; the place looks best in controlled lighting. The service is good! Everyone is very attentive. I had a good experience
4
Lolla is located close to China Town in a peaceful place in Singapore. Our dinner did happen at level 0 around the bar. We were able to look at every details of the kitchen and the staff preparing our dinner. Great choice and lovely wines too 
5
We arrived at 6:45pm and were the first customers that night. This had certain advantages because we got to choose where we wanted to sit. The restaurant has a large communal dining table in the basement, great for groups. Upstairs you can sit along a bar counter and watch the chefs prepare your meal. Outside there are a few small tables. We chose upstairs.No regrets. The handsome young sous-chef was friendly and entertaining. Since we were the first to arrive he took the time to explain how the various dishes were prepared and gave us his recommendation. Even as restaurant got quite busy later in the evening, the staff remained friendly and service was good. It was interesting not just watching our own meal being prepared, but also all the other items ordered that night.Their signature sea urchin pudding is something you must try. One serving can be shared between two people. In fact, all the food on the menu is cut and plated to be shared among friends, so although you can go as couple as we did, it would be even more interesting to go as a group where you can sample many different dishes.Many of the dishes are prepared over an open flame to give it an authentic grilled BBQ taste. The beef tongue and grilled octopus were both good; but the next time I go I'll probably order the ribeye steak. Sadly the beef tripe is no longer on the menu.Overall, a great experience. Suitable for couples if you don't mind not sitting alone. Most suitable for friends who like to share their food and sample different dishes
3
I went there for a Valentine's lunch and it was under my expectation: food is average, portions are small (no sides), atmosphere is boring (only 5 clients at 1pm, no music) therefore overhyped and overpriced ($70 per head)
5
Service was superb, food is excellent. Great wine selection too. No flaws for me. Will definitely come back!!
5
Excellent tapas, eating at the bar counter or downstairs on the big table with a group of friends is always an enjoyable experience. Love this place, keep coming
5
Went for a lunchtime meal on a Saturday and sat at the counter. Service was excellent and the food was really good. Highly recommended!
5
Everything about Lolla is outstanding. The food is devine and the service is outstanding. The Grilled avocado is a life changer. We've been twice and already planning to go back.
4
Love the atmosphere, 3rd time here! Always have different specials available so you would always look forward to new things to try! Never disappoint.
4
First time there, and I'll be back. Some of the things we ordered- signature uni pudding: fantastic. Squid ink pudding was fragrant and not fishy. Uni was prettt fresh. Would recommend 2 or 3 people per half portion Fried duck leg: BEST dish of the night. Perfectly fried with super crispy and fragrant skin, while maintaining moist meat - rack of lamb ribs: perfectly seasoned and cook- cod with miso: unfortunately this was far overcooked. Pity really, given that the garnishing and seasoning was perfect - ordered 2 wines and a gin tonic. Total bill came out to 200 total for 2.
4
This is a great place to come either as a couple, or in a group. The counter dining is a pleasant experience and you get to enjoy the flames shooting up! The avocado dish alone makes this place worth coming for, but other dishes to be recommended are the Octopus, the tuna tartare and the pork belly. It also has very good service for a Singaporean restaurant
4
We ate at the bar upstairs and it is such a good call if you are in a couple or dining solo.You can watch your food be freshly prepared right in front of you and it is very entertaining!We had a selection of dishes and I can recommend the Lamb rack, rich, flavourful and very tender.The tomato salad is excellent also, a taste of the med in your mouth
5
So far, all the dishes I've tasted here have ranged from good (mixed cured meat platter, soft egg with chorizo sausage) to very good (gratinated leek fondant, pear and walnut sorbet) to superb (grilled avocado, the super tender beef tongue escalope, chocolate pudding, sea urchin pudding, crema catalana).The staff, which includes quite a few very friendly Filipinos, knew enough about the food that they were serving to give good advice. Even the owner who was present in two out of my three visits was quite friendly and helpful. (Tip: when you get your bill they will hand you a coupon that gives you 30% off on your total bill on your next visit. In my case, I took too long to redeem the coupon and before I knew it, it had already expired. I regret not being able to use that coupon because it would have been so worth it. Fortunately, they gave me another set of coupons on my second visit. So on my third visit, I made sure to present the coupon and was finally able to claim that hefty discount.)Lastly, the unpretentious interiors, featuring the usual hipster-y reclaimed wood, warm lighting, post-post industrial touches exude a relaxed, humble bistro feeling
5
Lolla didn't disappoint! We went a little later in the lunch service so it was quiet- but great design n food-
5
Food was great! Staffs were friendly and make sure we did not over-order. Will definitely go back again.
5
Staff was friendly with recommending and explaining each dish. The dishes were tapas-style and all were 10/10! I love the Sea urchin pudding, lamb rack and sourdough (esp their special butter!).
5
Celebrated friend's birthday here on a weeknight. Had a table in the basement. The place has a good range of wines, the food are in small plates and enjoyed most of them tremendously. The service is awesome too
5
we ordered the sea urchin pudding (half portion was enough), chutoro tatare, quarter chicken (restaurant special) and the lamb rack. my personal favourite was the sea urchin pudding, followed by the chutoro tatare. both were flavourful and very soft. must try! :)
5
Very lovely, low-fi tapas bar. Great food. Truly outstanding sharing played and wine. Upstairs is a really great bar/chefs table seating arrangement overlooking food being prepared, (ask for a corner on the bar) downstairs is a communual table. Both are nice, I prefer upstairs myself. A must in Singapore
4
the service staff were very helpful with their recommendations. the kombu butter is a must-try, goes great with the toast. between the two of us, we had the kombu butter with toast, lamb tenders, halibut and lobster, cheesy pumpkin, and mushroom with truffle oil. and dessert and coffee. have to go back again to try the rest of the offerings
5
I went here on the recommendation of a friend and did not regret it. The food was unique and delivered in terms of quality and taste. The sea urchin pudding was rich and sinfully good, the steak perfectly seared with delicious caramelized onions that were moreish, the squid tender and flavourful and the cheeses very enjoyable. It was great watching the chefs prepare the meal as it was being cooked and me and my dining partner had a great time at Lolla
5
Came down here for brunch post marathon. Wasn't sure what to order so we asked for some recommendations. Ended up with uni pudding, foie gras toast and figs. The uni pudding would be the best thing I've tasted in Singapore in a long time! The foie gras and peach was a nice mix and was tasty. Figs were OK, but nothing special.Mimosas went along nicely. Will be back next time purely for the uni pudding. Don't take that off your menu
5
It is an intimate space: you can eat on the main floor at the bar and watch them create the masterful dishes and take in the aromas, truly a feast of the senses. Or, you can sit downstairs at a large table for sharing. The large table can also be reserved for special occasions. I have been here several times, both for business and pleasure. Each time, we order the grilled avocado in a cream sauce and every time, people rave about this dish. I have never been disappointed with any dish. The last time, I ordered the blueberry galette for dessert...simply outstanding; the crust was out of this world and the blueberry filling was served with crÃ¨me fraiche on top...just wow. The service is warm and friendly with the chef there behind the counter each time I have visited
4
The uni was awfully gooood, nice presentation, i love the aesop handsoap, really nice for hang out with friends
5
Quality of the food is only matched by the friendliness and attention to detail of staff. Amazing beef tongue.
5
Absolutely a culinary highlight in singapore-- great food, great service, great ambiance. Very worthwhile
4
Birthday celebration! We enjoyed the food very much but the restaurant has very few seats so we couldn't stay long even though we are willing to order more wine. We need to moved to a bar instead. Lovely decoration turning out nicely in photos
5
The foie gras and peach toast and sea urchin pudding are mu still trys! Along with the doughnuts for dessert. Will be back for more!
5
First visit and will definitely be back. Octopus, Iberico , avocados and duck fat potatoes were the winners!

What I want for a Sunday Lunch is really just fuss free delicious food and Lolla scores really high on that front. I have had dinner here before and thought it just middling, but this lunch changed my opinion. A series of relatively simple, utterly tasty little dishes arrived in perfect succession. Things like a well made tortilla topped with smoked eel and a small square of delicious crab lasagna were all big enough to share between 6, but not so huge it felt like you were eating a main course. So it's just perfect, leisurely grazing, washed down with copious amounts of wine.

this place is a tapas like food. The problem is that if you sit at the counter, you can see the cooks prepare every dish. And every dish looks so good that you cant help yourself but start ordering and ordering. The most instantgram is the black squid ink pudding with uni. The uni is very small but the pudding is very creamy. Many of the other dishes were also very good.My artners favourtie dish was the Brussel sprouts and mine was grilled avocado. Both simple dishes but very good
4
Location easy to find just about 5 mins walk from Tg Pagar MRT. Dining area is private with just one long dining table that can accommodate about 30 pax all at any one time is perfect for private group function. Ambience cozy with soft lighting make it feel homely. Had brunch. Service good. A bit pricey but a pleasant experience
4
+ Like the small plates concept, can share food with friends and sample a wider variety of the dishes. Good food and attentive service. Intimate ambience.- it's a small restaurant with mostly bar sitting so may not be suitable for larger groups. Wine is expensive

Went for Sunday brunch (Congrats on your 4th Anniversary, Lolla!)
Ordered the sea urchin pudding, was delicious
Rainbow chard salad was a tad salty but still tasty
Crab lasagne and grilled avocado made up a really hearty lunch, washed down with complimentary champagne
5
Food was fantastic! Great choices with unusual but yummy combinations. Staff was great and attentive.
5
Great food! Great ambiance! value for month too. aint exactly cheap per say, but good quality food for good prices!
5
Lovely atmosphere. We tried a number if the dishes & loved them all. The pork collar particularly stood out as did the hand torn pasta with crab. My friend & i enjoyed a champagne caraffe - just a nice size for 2 girls out
4
The food in general are quite good, expecting nothing less cos of it relative high price. However, the service staff are above standard and very helpful and friendly. Overall although the dinner was pricey. Its a relative good dining experience for me.
5
Went there on a Thur nite with 4 other frens. We were seated at one end of the communal table with another grp at the other, but it was ok.Server gave v good recommendation and my other friends were pleasantly surprised at the quality. There was a bday gal in our midst and the servers recommended steam chocolate pudding. Thumbs up!Highly recommended if u r looking for quality food not in huge portions - theirs are on sharing basis...
5
Had an awesome time at Lolla. Food is great isn't much that one can complain about. Food came in sharing portions so you could order almost one of each! Liked the hand torn pasta with blue swimmer Cessna and pork shoulder. The house red portugal wine was good too. We could have drank a few bottles easily. Only downside was the place is small thus an early dinner will mean the party ends at 8.30pm. And we weren't told about it when I did my reservation using chope. As dining is on a long table, it will mean having to share with a few other parties.
5
So I've been to Lolla's 5 times, over the course of 4 years. And every time I visit it, I wonder why I haven't been more regular. The food is simply FABULOUS!It's simple, wholesome and crazy delicious. Even the wines are delectable. It's the ideal place for a meal after work, for a girls night out or a cozy romantic date. If good food and great service is your idea of a good night out, then this is one place you definitely shouldn't miss.
4
Well this was a surprise, tapas in the middle of Singapore - and good tapas as that. We chanced upon this place after leaving our short walk in China Town. Dining is very informal on bar stools, counterside around the kitchen, but there is a larger table downstairs I saw others dining at. Dishes are well sized and not too expensive. We ate good cheese, Spanish tortilla, jamon and chorizo as well as some other dishes. Dessert was smoked chocolate ice cream which was very unusual but very nice. I'd recommend if you want slightly different western style food.
5
We visited for lunch, primarily to experience the Sea Urchin pudding .... which was great as we're all the other dishes we ordered. Lots of small plates, Al fresco dining, beautifully cooked and great service with a lovely bar downstairs. Worth a visit for lunch or dinner! Highly recommended
5
Overall, Lolla is a fantastic place. Food was divine and the service was impeccable. Great decor too! Will come back again!
4
The food was really good but I would prefer normal tables rather than high tables and high chairs. The staff knew their products really well and was very responsive when asked for recommendations. Pleasant dinner experience! :-)
4
Each visit to Lolla has been memorable. Apart from usual favs - duck rillettes, tomato salad, pork collar- The Shropshire Blue cheese special this time was phenomenal!!
5
Unique setting, fantastic food, very satisfied and will absolutely come back. I went with friends and we had few dishes. Avocado was fantastic.
4
my 2nd time in 2 months. try the sea urchin pudding, tomato salad, the avocados, the octopus and also the chocolate pudding.
3
pretty average all round. atmosphere was surprisingly poor. service was good though, primarily because of one service staff.
5
Top marks for service and ambience - sincere, cosy, unpretentious yet exquisite and classy. Just like the food! Great experience overall and worth the hype.
5
Commune style dining by bar counter. Service was fast, staff knew the menu well and were able to answer my questions and give recommendations.
4
We decided to go for a brunch with my Husband on a Sunday. We discovered this quiet place and were able to have a table at the bar and we could see the Chef cooking. For sure the food is fresh and good and atmosphere is nice. I really expected a bit more even if I have to recognise is was good. Maybe it s because I found the menu was not a big one (cf pic
4
Had dinner with friends at Lolla last weekend. The food was good and so was the ambience. We ordered Scallop Carpaccio, Lamb Rack, Ribeye Steak, Grilled Octopus and Sea Urchin with Squid Ink Pudding. Scallop Carpaccio was ok, Lamb Rack and Steak were cooked to perfection but the seasoning on the lamb was quite bland. Grilled Octopus was so-so, its was a little dry and not as good as we expected, but the Sea Urchin and Squid Ink Pudding was to die for. It was clearly the best dish that night.
5
Uni pudding is a must try. Along with some of their specials such as beef tongue and lamb rack.
There is limited space so remember to book early.
4
Everything we ordered tasted great. Sea Urchin Pudding, Lamb Chops, Tuna Tartare, Iberico Pork. Portions were unfortunately small and prices on the steep side. Restaurant only has bar stool seating. Only soft drink available is regular Coke from Mexico.
5
We love Lolla which is on trendy Club Street so near all the roof top bars, and little cafes.This is not a smart restaurant and we normally eat at a shared large table in the downstairs area, but the food is delicious. My favourites are the Octopus, the bread with seaweed butter and gratinated leek fondant.Do take a shawl or cardigan with you as the air conditioning can be a little fierc
5
This is one of those restaurants that provides a nice mix of fine food in a relaxed setting. I have been here a few times and particularly enjoy sitting at the bar and watching the crew at work. Favourite dishes are the grilled avocado, scrambled eggs (comes with a fish roe topping), grilled octopus, and lamb rack. The food is satisfying and service is good too. Worth a visit
3
The atmosphere is casual: you sit (on rather uncomfortable stools/chairs) either at the counter upstairs or at the communal table downstairs. A long drinks and wine list, plus the noisy environment, encourage you to drink and eat. Dishes are small plates for sharing. Many just involve basic preparation (eg. duck rillettes, terrine de foie gras on toast, apple radicchio salad, Iberico ham, etc). Most cooked dishes are average-to-good but not memorable (eg. lamb, beef tongue hash, Kurobota pork loin, stuffed squid, Spanish tortilla with smoked eel, etc). Only a few dishes are brilliant (A must try is the delicious sea urchin pudding! The crab lasagne is also not bad). In Europe, a similar meal would cost half the price at Lolla
5
Not a place for family, but perfect for a casual business lunch or chilled out dinner for 2. Upstairs at the bar is best, the downstairs is one large communal table. The sea urchin was worth the price, all the items are well sourced and have simple clear tastes
4
I was there with 3 girlfriends. We were seated at the bar where we could see the food being prepped in the open concept kitchen. At the far corner were small tables for 2. At the basement, we saw a big group of nearly 10-15 people. We ordered an array of dishes to share including the delicious uni pudding. The. Pudding. Was. To. Die. For. After more than 2 months, I still think about it. $8 for bread, ridiculous? Well, the Kombu butter was so good that I had to butter both sides of my toast. Im usually not a fan of tuna. But the tuna belly was so fresh, it almost melted in my mouth. The octopus was nicely grilled. It has the right amount of char-taste that it tasted good on its own without the sauce. Other less memorable dishes were the white asparagus & onsen egg served with curried hollaindasie , the beef & an egg dish. Not that they were mediocre. But they weren't extraordinary. Warning: This isn't the place to whisper sweet nothings to your other half. The place was very noisy when we were there & well partially it might have been us girls talking (ok, some shouting & shrieking). We noticed 2 guys (on a date?) left midway while complaining about the noise. Including a bottle of wine, spent about $500+. Pricey for a girls night out. But I will be back for the uni pudding & Kombu butter for sure.
3
I've eaten here a few times (my friends love it) and I'm still a bit unimpressed. They come for the sea urchin course, which if you like sea urchin is apparently fantastic. However, the rest is very hit and miss. For us this time the good courses we had were the leek gratin, candied fois gras and duck fat potatoes. The real let downs were the beef cheeks and octopus, both dishes very overcooked and although the flavours are great, the texture was completely ruined. Location is great, price is reasonable (if the food was served perfectly) and the drinks list is good. I'd love to give this place a better review but alas, I'm left wanting. I'll give it another go, but I wont rush back there in a hurry

located in the ann siang road, where all the interesting and hip places to eat and drink are, lolla is an unassuming place to eat - with a colorful facade that would remind you of greece or your grandma's garden. but when you go in, a more modern take is shown, with a marble/granite bar lined with black stools and metal and steel shelves showcasing glass vases and jars along with cans and containers of ingredients.even with this contradictory play to the senses, lolla has a menu that allows their customers to be comforted by dishes like duck fat potatoes, tuna belly chutoro tartare and grilled octopus (these were the ones we ordered). the service is also wonderful, with servers and hosts/hostesses ready to helpo you out with questions or even just to have a little bit of small talk.we went to lolla for lunch and it was packed - we had to wait a little bit so be ready to either wait or call in to reserve, especially for bigger groups
5
Sat at the counter and watched the culinary magic happen. Casual restaurant in An Saing hill. Best service and attention to detail. These folks take pride in everything! Grass fed Tasmanian Rib Eye grilled with onions, purple cauliflower with prices of grapefruit and bread crumbs. Sourdough toast with seaweed, herb butter. Delicious.
5
great food and nice atmosphere - especially rib eye steak excellent and grilled octopus
nice selection of wines
5
The food and service were excellent. Can't go past the duck rilkette as a starter! Just what we were looking for. Great wine selection too.
4
I will be back for their iberico pork :) love their Ubi pudding and Donuts with lemon curd. So so yummy!
5
We picked up this restaurant from a Singapore visitors book, what an amazing find.The book told us to sit at the counter to watch the 3 chefs do their work and this was what we did...what a wonderful experience, they all were so good at what they did and hardly needed to speak with one another as they worked in such harmony.But the best bit is the food...truly exceptional.3 of us and one had the Threadfin fish...superb, crab lasagna...unusual and so tasty...other main was a leek gratin casserole...absolutely mouthwateringAs a side we had grilled avocado which was done on a brazier right in front of us then topped with sough dough bread crumbs, pine nuts and pickled fennel, this was amazing!!Desserts... smoked scarmorza(like a grilled cheese with peach compote...heavenly...creme catalana, like a creme brûlée really excellent plus a couple of ice creams...vanilla and peanut jelly....very yummy.Out 88yo friend had never experienced anything like this and has not stopped talking about how good the Threadfin(Tuna) was and what a wonderful time she had watching the chef's.I could not give a higher recommendation for this restaurant and I am a serious foodie!! :-)I watched, duck breast, racks of lamb, pork collars and much more get prepared and go out, they all looked amazing.For the nuts and bolts people it cost us $180.00 for 3 mains and 1 side, 4 desserts(yes 4 my wife had 2 :-)) and some sparkling water....it has an amazing wine list as well
5
Food is always stunning. You can't miss the Sea Urchin Squid Ink Pudding - so rich and tasty. The tuna chuturo tartare is spot on as well with good plating. Pork collar is cooked to the right tender texture. Grilled avocados turned my non-avo fan friend into one! Funky cool vintage decor with fine wine bottles on the counter. The basement is the best kept secret for functions and big gathering. Service is considerate as well. They will try go out of their way to accommodate us. It's not cheap but definitely worth the penny.
3
We sat down at a communal table where the atmosphere was fun but unusual. I would highly recommend a person to bring their friends to sit down with them and make sure that they enjoy food that is very eclectic beforehand. The grilled squid was delicious but the pork beef check was sweet and bland, for example. The communal table would be a fun place for a group of people or a very friendly couple. The service was extremely good compared to other restaurants in Singapore
3
Went here for lunch having been to many other tapas restaurants and I would have to get better value for money if I was to return. The food was good but the prices are high for the relatively small portions you get. Staff are attentive and siting at the bench at the kitchen is an engaging experience and the food was generally good but not outstanding
5
service was professional, informational (about the food and wine they serve) and personable.food was excellent. small plates allowed for multiple dishes to taste and the plating was a delight to the eyes. the chef tries to capture the essence of the fresh ingredients used in his cooking. we loved the uni pudding, iberico pork, grilled avocado & donuts (must try)
5
For starters we had olives, uni with squid pudding and they werr heavenly. Followed by cheese platter and egg with bottarga de mungine. The beef tongue was the main and it was marvelicious - the meat was so tender. Dessert drew a beautiful ending the the sumptuous meal. We had the chocolate pudding and doughnut with lemon curd. We were stuffed and satisfied
5
When you go to Lolla, make sure you have their signature dish, the sea urchin pudding. Extraordinary. We shared a half-portion between two of us and it's so rich that I think that's the right amount. We had 4 of their tapa-sized dishes for lunch. As well as the sea urchin we had the spanish omelette with smoked eel. That had a delicious slightly lemony back-taste that I couldn't quite place - but we did see a sauce bubbling in the serving dish before the omelette was turned into it. (We sat at the counter, where you can see the food being prepared). We also had the grilled octopus with lots of smoky paprika, and the grilled avocado. This was the third time I'd had the grilled avocado. The first time it was sublime and somehow it's lost that special touch, and is now pleasant but not extraordinary
4
Tad expensive. Too bad they don't open on Sunday's. Last order strictly at 2 which was a bit annoying since they accepted my 130 reso on a Saturday
1
Really good and fresh ingredients that got murdered in an overzealous attempt with oil and salt. What a sacrilege.
5
It is hard to believe how a restaurant with such an unassuming existence can serve Michelin star quality of food. Lolla cafe tucked away in the club street area is small, compact but leaves a big impact. They create innovative dishes with exotic vegetables and demonstrate how simple ingredients can be combined together to create magic. Their Uni dish and the grilled avocado are stellar quality. We also tried their specials for the day which was pretty good. But the desserts really did it for us. Scamorza with peach compote and donuts with Lemon curd were absolutely delightful. With daily specials available in addition to the regular menu, the restaurant will have something new to offer in every visit. High recommended and must try!
5
This is indeed a hidden gem within the walls of several restaurants in the area. The place was charming and pleasant and the food was fantastic! The Sea Urchin Pudding was delicious and very cream. Our other favorites would be the Burrata and the Rib Eye Steak. I can't wait to come back Ã
5
Visited Lolla with my partner on the evening of 26th March. Made a reservation and you can choose between the 6.30 - 8.30pm or 8.30 till close slot. reservations are highly recommended. Decor of Lolla is very chic and cosy in its own way. It was our first time there and we got a sit by the counter and we truly enjoyed watching the chefs work their magic. Everything we ordered was good and the few stand outs were the pork collar, the scallops carpaccio and the steam chocolate pudding. Even the sourdough with Kombu Butter tasted YUM!Service was also very prompt and friendly. Pricing might be a little steep but if you order the right stuff, it really is worth it!It cost about $240 for 2 of us and we had 6 dishes, 2 desserts and 2 drinks. We were extremely filled and satisfied after the meal
4
A last minute booking we ended up in the downstairs area on a long table with fabulous lighting. The sea urchin pudding was amazing - very rich but yum. My friends loved the burrata but there was too much truffle oil for me. Plates are small and it is expensive but it is delicious. The wine list is small but thoughtful. The Chianti we shared was just amazing
5
Quirky ambiance, extremely helpful and attentive staff and, most importantly, amazing food! It just all works well together. It's a small plates restaurant (tapas-like) which is perfect for women who want to try everything and not have to order only one dish. Simple stuff like the Kombu butter was addicting! The Sea Urchin was unique and worth the experience; the pork, avocado, scallops and doughnuts are all memorable. I want to go back immediately
5
We were lucky enough to get a table last minute as you need to make reservation in advance as they are very popular and there is good reason why! Because the food is amazing. It is small portion which I find is more enjoyable. All the dishes we tried were amazing - the sea urchin - was out of this world - must try! :
5
Went for dinner without reservation and managed to get bar seats. Chef was friendly and nice and asked us if we have any preference. We opted for no beef having had lunch at steakhouse. I was apprehensive about the sea urchin, I do not particularly like uni and the price was on the steep side for such a small serving but figured I should try their signature. It didn't disappoint, fresh and everything but personally not something that I will eat again.Tuna belly was very fresh. We had way so many delicious small plates, grilled avocado was one of the memorable one. Doughnut with lemon curd was great to end the dinner.It is a rare find to have all that we ordered very delicious. My dining companion is a Spanish gentleman visiting Singapore, and he was blown away. Staff was very friendly without being too much.I haven't stopped recommend this place since
5
Many people recommended the sea urchin pudding - which was lovely on the palette. But the real star for us was the grilled octopus. Lovely charred grill flavour, juicy, not too chewy. The umami lingered on the tongue hours after. Worth a visit just for this, but the other food is good too. The italian white wine was lovely and juicy and bright accompaniment
3
The restaurant looks very nice inside but found out the price was too hight for lunch.
The lunch menu Starting from $30...
4
Friendly chef and services. Different environment of open concept of dine. Clean kitchen, serving area and toilet.
4
Had a very nice lunch at Lolla yesterday with friends. Counter seating overlooking the kitchen. Service was excellent and the food was amazing.
4
reccomend sea urchin puddings - its like gold in your mouth. This place has a very rustic atomsphere with small plates. The food is always high quality, they don't do cocktails but they do port. Manchego was also one of my favorites!
3
The food taste is very good, the below level has a nice big sharing table. HOWEVER, the quantity of all the dishes is too small and the price is exorbitant! We paid 90 dollars each and left not even full!
3
The star of the show left some time ago and gradually over the last 6 months the deterioration has set in.Some staple items taken off the menu. Attitude of on show chefs changed. Flavours are changing. Front staff like to clean up as early as possible. But prices have stayed right up there!!
4
I was invited to Lolla for lunch What a gem it is!It offers only bar seating, which I was apprehensive about at first, but it turned out to be a real delight!Watching the kitchen staff at work was fascinating. It was a prelude of the excellent food to come. Don't miss the leek fondant, it is out of this world! The avocado was a most unusual concoction, the fresh scallops and tuna belly was a real delight! The service staff were very attentive and even provided tote bag to hang my clutch. This is a restaurant I will return to
4
We dropped in to Lolla just to try as we had tried to get a table a couple of times.Really nice tapas like food. Watch out for the dish of the day dishes on the black board at the entry. We took a couple of them and they were sooo good.Service really good, only thing is that they fill your wine glass a littletoo fast. It could give the impression that they are hurrying you. But after the main courses they explicitly asked us to take our time before ordering desserts. So nothing to complain about.Expensive as always in Sungapore, but either you accept that or you stay home. Si nothing to complain about really
3
I went to Lolla for lunch with two friends. We were the only three in the restaurant the entire time. The music was so loud we couldn't hear each other so I asked the waitress to turn the music down and she made a big deal about having to ask the boss and then barely moved the dial. So I had to beg two more times to get it down to a level where we could converse - and again, we were the only three in the place. So while the food really is excellent, it's unfortunate that the owner has such little respect for the clientele that pay the bills. And to be fair, if the place was full of hipsters that wanted the music on full, I can respect that. However, when you've only got three people and they politely ask to turn the music down, I don't understand why they would refuse unless they just don't care about the customers. So excellent food plus terrible customer service equals average..
5
was recommended this place by a colleague during a work trip - got a seat at the bar and ended up literally trying the entire menu! Wow was blown over with the quality of the food, initially went to try the sea urchin pudding which they're famous for (bitter sweet similar to foie gras but much thicker less slippery/gooey consistency - not bad at all!) Had the burrata with figs (with honey amazing!), the veal tongue, and the doghnuts with lemon curd for dessert (heaven) and the chocolate pudding (amazing dark chocolate) ooh and they served the best dessert wine (Chateau de la Roulerie Coteaux du Layon), loved it and the unpretentious slick diner atmosphere - really felt like I was in Seville, cannot recommend it enough
5
My boyfriend and I had a wonderful evening at this tapas restaurant! We enjoyed 4 dishes which were all delicious! The staff were extremely chatty and super friendly, it was a fantastic atmosphere and great service! A must visit, do not hesitate!
5
I love it. Tapas style, fresh ingredients, nice decor and excellent service. You need to pay the price but the freshness and inventiveness of the whole menu is worth it.
4
The place is nicely decorated but rowdy as the space is quite small. Not so suitable for quiet dates.
4
Nice interior and service is great. Food is alright / good, lots of special tapas that you might not be able to find else where but i think trying it once is good enough for me....
5
Food was excellent as usual.The lamb, uni pudding,tuna etc simply melts in your mouth. Uni is to die for
5
Watch the chef in action at the bar seats. Great selection of tapas. Really fresh ingredients and comes with higher price tag.
4
Lolla serves a delicious selection of tapas style small plates which are ideal for sharing. As ever, it can be slightly difficult to judge how much to order but the waiting staff help you judge it right and provided some good tips, such as the slow cooked egg with chorizo which was delicious and the scallop ceviche.I've been twice. Once as a twosome when we sat at the bar and once as a foursome when we sat at the long table downstairs. On both occasions it was fairly noisy with the other guests clearly having a good time - not ideal for a quiet romantic date but if you're feeling in robust good humour it should be fine. Overall a very enjoyable meal and I shall certainly return
4
This small tapas bar on popular Ann Siang Road is well worth a visit. The food is delicious, well crafted, traditional Spanish tapas, and the atmosphere is fun if slightly noisy.My favourite dishes were the Scallop carpaccio and tuna tartare - both served raw, also the burrata with roasted vegetables, which was from the specials list.Two things to remember:1. As in a lot of Singapore restaurants the air conditioning is set to cold, so take a cardigan/jacket2. They have little choice in the way of beer, so come ready to drink wine
5
First visit in Singapore. Choices unending but Lolla stands out as thoughtful and unique option with excellent results. Tapas and small plates that we had were all outstanding. Service excellent. Was clearly a favorite of locals for celebration and laid back sophisticated atmosphere. Would return in a heartbeat
4
Excellent atmosphere - seats were by the bar counter just directly infront of chefs who were preparing our food.Excellent service - wait staff were friendly and attentive. Average value for money - A little pricey for the food but comparable to restaurants in the vicinity.Good, tasty, fatty umami food.
3
If you are really hungry, you will not get full with an appetiser and a main dish. Even though the food was really good, portions were too small in my opinion!
5
Great food, great service, and friendly waitstaff, what more could you ask for? Especially liked the scallop carpaccio and squid ink pudding. They also gave us an order of the doughnuts with lemon curd, on the house!
5
We have our date nights at Lolla every week and we keep coming back for the food, wine and the company!
5
Dinner here was fantastic. Enjoyed all the starters and mains we ordered. The decor, atmosphere and service was also top notch. Most of the seats (including ours) are around the kitchen so it's interesting watching the chefs at work. The only downside is there aren't many tables for larger groups where sitting around the counter doesn't work. The sea urchin pudding is a highlight. Simply mouth watering and I was craving it the very next day.
3
Perhaps due to the hype ard this place, we really felt the experience at lolla was just alright. We tried:Uni Pudding - Way too thick for my liking. Couldn't even finish the puddingBeef Tripe - Not great. The brown sauce overpowered the natural savouriness of the tripeScrambled Eggs - Too oily. and it was really just plain scrambled eggs, at $22 bucksLamb Chops - This was ordered medium rare and it was the saving grace of the night. Not spectacular but good.Prawns (Special) - Fresh. Not spectacular but good
5
Food was amazing, not a single dish disappointed. My only regret is that we couldn't try more things. Kombu butter was sublime, if they sold it, I would buy it to use at home. Service was attentive, but not obtrusive and they also had a great wine list. 
3
Nice stuffs but we were rushed to order; so either way you accept us and you calm down or you refuse the table. Pais 380 dollars for a very light dinner. the duck fat potatoes tasted just like potatoes. The cheese platter was small and over priced. The rib eye was good. Atmosphere downstairs is nice. Wine was cold and goo
5
A Singapore friend took me and my wife to lunch at Lolla, we ordered the fatty tuner, scallop and duck breast. The food were nicely prepared with top of the class ingrident。 I would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone if they want good Mediterranean food in Singapor
5
Lolla was everything it promised to be... Forget looking at the menu and pick what you fancy based on what the lovely boys in the kitchen dish out! The food was wonderful... The service was personal and attentive with an almost "old friend" / "family" vibe
4
I was at Lolla on Saturday to have lunch with my friend. It was my first time visiting Lolla and we arrived there quite late 13.30 (last order 13.45) so, we had to hurry to order our food. We had Sea Urchin pudding, Grilled avocado, Duck Rillete and Duck breast with fig purée. After making an order, the chef was ready and start doing his job. He took off a box of sea urchin from the fridge - it was freshly n directly sent from Japan everyday, claimed by the chef. Yes!!! It was very fresh - a clear yellow to orange color and a cruster of the whole piece without any liquid can be a good notice. The black pudding underneath sea urchin was actually vanilla custard with blank ink squid. The cold creamy texture like pannacotta but tighter eating with fresh n sweet savory of sea urchin... Very well done!!!! A perfect bite :))))For grilled avocado, simply delicious :)))) grilled avocado with fennel reduced sauce topped with thinly fresh sliced onion and bitter-fresh of coriander -- Fab!!!The other two of duck were just on average. Duck with fig purée was quite weird. The Rillete was ok . Nothing special.
5
Up scale innovative tapas restaurant. Not cheap (but doesn't pretend to be). Hardly intimate as you sit along a bar but you get a great view of the excellent chefs preparing the often outstanding dishes - looking forward to trying out the sister reataurant soon!
2
Very noisy and lots of echo at the long table downstairs. Food was slipped onto the plate - garnishing and presentation was clearly not a priority. Service was alright. Would NOT recommend to go for a date night.
5
To be honest, I have never heard of this place before I booked it. Other than the price, everything else were fantastic. Great food, good wine and absolutely great service all round. Had a great time. Will be back.
3
after I made an online reservation, I got a call saying I'd have to complete dinner in 2 hrs.
The mood was mediocre, though the best thing was the duck fat potatoes.
3
I have been to Lolla a few times but my recent visit has been after awhile. The wait staff was friendly and attentive but I have to say the quality of the ingredients has deteriorated. For the price point, you can better food and exprience.
2
Great atmosphere and had the makings for a fantastic night. This place does not really follow the normal Tapas approach and menu. The prices looked expensive for Tapas portions so we were expecting something special. The food was good but sizes and prices did not correlate, expensive for what you get. I was particularly disappointed with my Lamb Rack. At S$28 I was expecting more than the 2 lonely cutlets that arrived. The disappointment continued with the grand finale being our cheese platter. We were all looking forward to our cheese and red wine. When the platter arrived (again, very small) we were told we could not order any more wine. The prospect of empty wine glasses and a full cheese platter in front of us was the straw that broke the camels back. My very placid friend finally voiced his annoyance at the waitress. She bumbled and finally saw reason and back tracked with a hint of attitude. What a joke? We finished up our wine and cheese and left feeling hungry and annoyed. I will not be going back and will not be recommending this place
4
Finally tried the famous uni pudding and proceeded to have my mind blown. Scrambled eggs, duck fat potatoes, beef tripe, and leek fondant were also amazing. We also shared manchego cheese and sourdough bread board which were simple yet really hit the spot. Service was impeccable - staff were extremely attentive, and always ensure that our glasses were topped up with sparkling and/or tap water. When we arrived, we were also advised to move our car to the outdoor parking lot further down the road as we were not aware of the road closure of Ann Siang Road/Club Street between 7pm-2am. Overall an excellent experience! We will certainly be back

I was shocked by the hygiene standard the cook was using a small "spear" to check how the meat was cooked and then touching his lips to know if was hot enough inside the piece of meat . and repeating that over and over without cleaning the metal stick . If you want an open kitchen at least don't do this in front of your customer ... The food is good but nothing exceptional and prices are on the high range of equivalent tapas placesall in all bad experience , dont go ther

For the adventures who love surprises, this place has a new menu every day. The quirky yet tasteful decor makes the dining experience all the more enjoyable and fun. Their friendly and attentive staff add a lively vibe to the place. The best thing is no doubt the dishes that are painstakingly conceived from the fresh ingredients available that day
3
The food is good, no doubt. The only remark is that the menu is relatively small. We ate what we liked on the menu, so if we'd go back there, we'd probably have to eat the same items again as we didn't like the others. But don't get me wrong, the food is of great quality, there just isn't a lot of choice. The place itself is not too big, with two tables outside (which we prefer) and the staff is very friendly. We got a free wine 'upgrade' as they didn't have the one we wanted so we got a slightly more expensive one at the same price. All in all a nice place you can go back to say once every year.

Love this part of Singapore, lots of lovely eats and great bars. Lolla is a great evening out. I had a really delicious meal with friends, the atmosphere is great. Visiting again next time I'm in town
3
If you're craving tapas around Club Street then Lolla is your best bet. They have some communal seating though, so don't mind your personal space!
4
We ordered what was very classic on the menu. The wine list was exhaustive and of good quality as well. Service was very courteous. Looks like they are executing very well a simple, authentic menu of Spanish fares.
5
6 of us where at the restaurant over the weekend and had a great time there. We were seated at the basement at the end of a large communal table. It was a nice setting. The food and wine were excellent, we enjoyed everything there. The service was also pretty good. One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore so far.
3
The good here was of a very good standard but quite expensive. The major failing is the seating - it seems to have been designed for children and is very uncomfortable. Perhaps it's part of a strategy to turn tables quickly but doesn't make for an ambient experience. Also, staff tried to collect last orders at 10pm on a Saturday night - a bit on the early side and not conducive to a welcoming atmosphere. Overall, just ok. Wouldn't rush back.

Lolla is a small plates restaurant which I have always been meaning to try. Finally got the chance on a Monday which turns out to be a perfect time as the restaurant was not busy at all. There are two levels, a bar which surrounds an open kitchen and a communal table downstairs. There is a small menu supplemented by seasonal specials. Although I didn't have wine, they do have an excellent wine list. I saw a Gruner Vertliner I particularly wanted to try but had to wait for when I had company.Was recommended to have the Sea Urchin Pudding as a starter and it didn't disappoint. This is a cold custard made unctuous with eggs, cream and squid ink. It is served cold with a generous dollop of uni or sea urchin. Available in full or half portions, this dish had that umami goodness that made you savour every spoonful till it was all gone.Followed this with a really fresh Hokkaido scallop carpaccio that had beautiful clean flavours. The shellfish was plump and was sweet and succulent. I thoroughly enjoyed this one. After this came Grilled Avocado which was on the specials menu. The description may be deceptively simple but the taste was anything but. Creamy dense avocados were grilled and served with shavings of fennell and dusted with sourdough crumbs and pinenuts. I have to say this dish was also a winner and I hope it makes it to the regular menu.For the meat course, there were two succulent cutlets cut from a rack of lamb. Done medium rare, it was just the right shade of pink & was served with a little Cavolo Nero on the side. The dish was juicy and executed to perfection.Service is excellent here by the way and my server recommend I try their signature ice cream when I was deliberating whether to order a cheese course. Smoked dark chocolate ice cream and a honey yuzu sorbet were ordered. The smoked ice cream had an interesting taste that lingered; I can't say if everyone who tries this will be a fan but you definitely won't forget this. The sorbet was refreshing but I cannot offer a reason why you should order this when there are excellent selections of cheeses as well as a steam chocolate pudding with cocoa nibs or doughnuts with lemon curd being offered as well.Lolla ranks high among places I would go to on a Monday for a lazy lunch but I understand the rest of the time you're better off making a reservation

I thought I was going for tapas; you know, patatas bravas, Mejillones rellenos, albondigas etc. The fun of tapas being I can't really pronounce the names but it all tastes great and I can share it with friends; supported by a cracking bottle of Rioja, cerveja or sangria. Turns out that tapas has gone neo modern and the chorizo is replaced by sea urchins and the Gambas by beef tripe. To be honest I wasn't excited. But give Lolla their dues the food was tasty. Favorite on my list was sausage with soft egg and duck fat potatoes followed by grilled octopus. You have to try the sea urchin pudding which although very rich is surprisingly good. Less exciting were the lamb chops ( didn't get the idea there) and the mixed cold meat platter (nothing different or interesting on the board and not much of it either). The wine list is great and has heavy European influence to pair with the food style. Price wise it's Singapore style (expensive) but no more than similar places.
3
i had high expectations on this place vut found the dishes to be quite bland. The presentation was wonderful, the service was alazing but the food was a big let down. we ordered the tortilla, if one can call it that, big chunks of udnercooked potato in egg soup, the octopus was just ok and the manchego cheese was very good. the highlight of the night was the crema catalana dessert, but it wasnt enough to make me consider going back
5
Was back in Singapore and stopped by Lolla's again for a team dinner. We ate at the bar which I prefer as you get to see the chef's do what they do best...create magical food. There were some great additions including the pork to their menu that I previously had experience with. The baked leeks were fantastic as always and every piece of meat was great...which sometimes is a tricky thing in Singapore. The rib-eye was up to snuff as always and the deserts fantastic. Not had a bad thing on the menu and we went to town once again. The prices are a bit much but it is Singapore in a popular section amongst people competing foodies who pay little or no taxes or are using the company cards. Also, drinks could be worked on as they are lacking, but, like I said, a must do for anyone who likes a great meal
5
Fabulous food, great service, great atmosphere, pricey but worth it. We sat at the bar, which I recommend as one sees what they are cooking and it's really fabulous to watch, entertaining and most inspiring, done with such professionalism and nonchalance. I suggest the leek gratin as it was amazing I could have had another of those. I wouldn't mind going back and just deciding what to eat by simply watching what they were preparing in front of me. Probably a good idea to book a place as it did get busy.
5
Been twice now. .a truly amazing eating expetience. Deliciuos food snd very good sevice. Revommend a visit.
5
The staff here are very pro-active, warm and deliver an excellent service. The food are great too, we love the kombu butter. Will definitely go back and recommend this to others.
5
We really enjoyed the food at Lolla. Every tapas was very tasty and quite big.
5-6 tapas was enough for two.
The tomato bruschetta, the duck rillettes, the leek gratin were delicious for example. I strongly recommend!
3
Place nice to chill out and have dinner, small but comfortable, and friendly people, good choice of wine
4
We had a decent selection of pretty much everything on the lunch menu for 6 people. The urchin & squid ink was incredible and generally every dish we had was of the highest standard. I would give a 5* if the staff were not so rude (one in particular). General patronising comments from the older lady who works there. If the food was not that amazing I wouldn't go back again otherwise
4
Had lunch there with a group of colleagues and we sat at the tapas bar. Small place with good ambience and good food. A little on the pricey side but if you like great tasting tapas with a twist this is an excellent choice of a restaurant
4
Three of us went to Lolla last Wednesday and had a great meal. With a couple of glasses of wine it was about $100 per head. The menu is great for sharing we had six dishes and you have to try the sea urchin pudding ! The desserts are great and the atmosphere is terrific. Only downside is upstairs is a little noisy
5
We ended up at Lolla's while wondering where to have dinner in Club street. The small dishes approach is a modern take at the traditional tapas and it was..... Amazing, products of quality, very nice wine list and friendly service. We sat at the bar, ideal to look over the rest of the restaurant and the kitchen. We had 3 starters, 2 main, 2 dessert and a great Rioja. All for 260$. I will go back for sure!! Hmmm Iberco pork and calamares were to die for. Worth trying. Go there!
4
On a quiet balmy Singapore night last month, staying at The Scarlet on Erskine Rd, I wandered down and along Club Street to find dinner.I came across a quirky, funky European tapas style restaurant, Lolla.The staff were all young and hip, dressed in black with cool music playing.I secured a table at the bar overlooking the chefs working hard on the dishes.The entre slices of Manchego cheese with a delicious homemade fig preserve were light and very morish.A simple refreshing tomato salad garnished with air-dried olives and oil was a revelation.The Spanish tortilla with smoked eel was simply scrumptious, every mouthful a delight with the subtly pungent smoked eel across every mouthful - YUM!A glass or two of the Pazo de Senorans, Albarino was a wonderful balance to the tart tomato and the rich eel.Overall, a great little European find in Singapore
4
I would come back to try the other small plates that I did not try last night. Surprisingly my favourite of the night was not the Sea Urchin pudding which I've heard raving reviews. It was good but I find it a little salty. Same goes for the Kombu Butter. My favourite went to the desert. Steam Chocolate pudding. Its served with vanilla ice & when eaten together. I think the textures melts perfectly in my humble opinion. Tomato Salad and pork collar were very good. Dun mind those again. Atmosphere was nice with good music. Service was attentive and great sitting on th encounter watching the chefs prepare the meals. We did smell a little but I was warned against sitting in the basement. Overall a good meal even thought its tad pricey
3
I don't understand the tapas here. I can't see the attraction as I have been to better restaurant with better tapas...
I say do try as it is a vibrant atmosphere.
5
Everything we ordered was delicious, but like any tapas place, its a bit pricey. I tried the sea urchin pudding, but didn't care for the texture.
5
In some ways, this is a review of the first time I ever went to Lolla 2 years ago. As someone who eats out a lot, meals tend to blend into each other - but Lolla is different. Every dish stands out in my memory as if it were just yesterday. And so I went back yesterday, expecting to be disappointed, as one always is when comparing against a mythical memory. But here's the rub: everything was exactly as good as the first time I had it! The uni and squid ink pudding was exquisitely rich, the octopus so tender yet chewy, the service attentive and friendly, and the open kitchen atmosphere hypnotically chaotic. Whatever they are doing, it continues to deliver outstanding memories... And that's ALL you could ever want on a date night
5
Great food & service, a refreshing difference in the local dining scene of usual surly service in many joints. Signature black pudding was so good I wanted to lick the container it came it, shame I don't have a nice long tongue. The rest of the savory tapas weren't bad either. Our lunch experience was a little hampered by the short kitchen service which stops at 2pm. We took dessert elsewhere nearby. 
3
While the food was creative and fresh, it basically ends there. For all the hype surrounding the food it was spoiled by an eager and earnest-looking server trying very hard to charm us off two glasses of 'premium' wine at $50 a pop. At least we would appreciate the courtesy to inform us of the price range we have in mind before bringing out the whole cow. And what a cow it was. Given we should've asked the price, but from the implied friendliness and presumed courteousness we would've expected more. Lesson learn, never expect waiters to be kind and friendly without the risk of slitting your throat, just like the cows in Kobe. They massage you, feed you beer, play you nice music and off you go. Okay, maybe that's over dramatised the whole thing but we have heard so much good stories about the place that we had high hopes. Nevertheless, will not be returning unless it's the end of the world and or starved at the impending zombie attack or apocalypse.
3
Wait staff were prompt and professional. Food was served relatively quickly. One major downer was when the staff manager repeatedly insisted we finish our meal within the allotted time (it was weekend; a 2 hour time-slot was allocated at the communal time for our party of 4) or be shifted to the bar area upstairs.
5
A small intricate restaurant that lives up to its name: serving small simple plates, combining the finest ingredients and seasonal produce with the influences of the mediterranean..Dinner on a weekday: We had mixed olives, Don Bocarte Anchovies, Hokkaido Scallops Carpaccio, Iberico pork collar and Smoked Scamorza with Peaches Compote... each dish has its own unique way of preparation, such heavenly meal!!A truly great experience in Singapore! A+ recommendation for all!!
3
Was here on a Saturday evening with a friend for some dinner and was lucky to be offered a seat at the corner of the first floor. We reached around 830pm and unfortunately a lot of food was sold out, which was quite disappointing as we were looking forward to trying them.The uni pudding was tasty, but it didnt really live up to the hype and we were expecting a lot more. They also charged for bread, which was quite surprising considering it was just normal sourdough. We had the grilled octopus (was a tad burnt), the lamb rack, spanish tortilla and a bottle of wine. It was a nice evening but just not as memorable as what we expected, and didnt live up to the hype
4
I had my birthday lunch at Lolla on a weekday, the service staff was friendly and it was great to get up close with the chefs. I brought my parents who never experienced modern Spanish tapas before and they really enjoyed the sensorial dining concept! I will definitely come back for the duck rilettes with toasted sourdough; tomato salad and the ever famous uni pudding. More importantly, the restaurant maintains its quality and tastes very well throughout the years
5
From the moment we stepped in to the moment we left everything was perfect! It was late and their kitchen was closing but the staff were very accomodating and told us to come in anyway. The service was extremely attentive and the food was also amazing! We had the mixed house olves...the cured meat platter..lamb rack...Hokkaido scallops! The whole atmosphere was fantastic too..seated at the counter where the chefs are at work as well. The got one of our orders wrong but immediately apologised and made up for it..and the desserts are to die for...the cream catalana especially! I am so grateful for having a bad experience in another restaurant that made us leave there and stumble upon Lolla!!
4
Sea urchin pudding was v good. Beet root carpaccio was great. Kale was delicious with brown butter
Slow cooked beef rib was tasty Just a pleasure to come back
5
Great selection of food with good variety
Service was excellent with the staff giving good advice on the choices.
5
Popped into Lolla for a salad prior to leaving Singapore. What I got was a delicious, creative, inventive salad with couscous, quinoa, harissa, carrots roasted in honey and other delicious ingredients. Nadia, thanks so much for my last delicious bite in Singapore.
5
This is a restaurant I frequent during my business trips; as I donâ€™t feel self conscience eating alone. There are no tables but rather eating is along a bar looking directly at the staff preparing your meal, artisans on show. The food and the passion of the staff is the real attraction. The dishes are small, either to be shared or as I prefer all to myself. The colours, flavours and aromas ooze freshness; the combinations are innovative and the specials as good as the must-haves on the paper place mat menus. The wines are an unusual selection, to be more precise selected from wineries I am not familiar. This is another reason I enjoy dining here, I feel my culinary knowledge has always been expanded after each visit. I will not single out any particular dish, it is all good; all I will suggest is visit Lolla more than once and slowly work through the menu. The young head chef has left since my last visit; however he has always promoted his staff and mentored them to one day step into his shoes; therefore I am confident Lolla is still in good hands
5
Fresh off the plane, we decided to have a small bite before calling it a night. At Lolla we found exactly that and at a very high standard. The lamb was cooked perfectly in front of us as were the ribs. For desert I can highly recommend the donuts with lemon curd, but also the chocolate ice cream is of great quality. All paired with a nice glass of wine and great, friendly service made this a great start of our trip
5
This is my third time at Lolla and it is just like the first time. I brought a friend who came down for a visit from Australia who has her 4 month old baby and her 10 year old son. One of the staff came regularly to check on her and see if she needed anything which was fantastic. Everyone loved the food, even my friend's son, his comment was the food was fresh and delicious
5
Lolla - keep coming back , top spot for intimate creative eats, tapas theme fantastic Japanese influences on dressings, fashion dishes and wine at the bar seeing chefs do their magic and the service is fantastic - wine list great by the glass options and the specials are always excellent. Cant speak highly enough ! upstairs is best for small groups at the counter, basement has a great set up for larger groups on long table - looking forward to next visi
5
Great little restaurant with a varied and delicious menu. Fast service (slow down order if you want to take your time). Beautiful ingredients, well presented. Will be back here to try more of what is on the menu - Anchovies were amazing as was the chocolate pudding. Go for a bar seat to watch the cooks at work
5
To stand out from the crowd in terms of service in Singapore is not terribly difficult and Lolla definitely stands out. The service is attentive without being intrusive and the staff are knowledgeable about the food & wine. As a vegetarian, eating at a restaurant where the menu is based around sharing plates can often prove difficult but Lolla stands out in this respect too. There are plenty of dishes to keep the vegetarians happy & the meat eaters I have been with have all been impressed too.If you're looking for a nice dinner or kicking off a night out I would not hesitate to recommend Lolla, it would be rude not to
3
Ive visited Lolla 3 times by now. Twice for food and once only for some drinks.I must say that the place is very charming and nicely set up, which puts your expectation of food & service up.I love to sit on high chairs by the bar and observe bar tenders or chefs doing their job.At Lolla you have a big open kitchen to watch.The menu is has a selection of tapas that seem to be uncomplicated and yummy.We ordered a couple of tapas to share. Best was the Smoked Scamorza Cheese! Besides that we had the marinated olives that were nice, the bread was crispy and warm and the lamb chops were juicy and nicely cooked, but the worst was the Octopus!It was really badly cooked - all chewy and not eatable - I had to send it back.We were offered to exchange it to something else, so we chose the Crema Catalana for dessert - but this wasnt good either! The crema has been caramelized few hours ago and then put back into the fridge... so the sugar crust wasnt there anymore and it was just not the way it is supposed to be.Now to the wine list...This was actually a joke! We opened the wine menu to look up for a red wine. The first page of the wine list had like 6 or 7 different wines on it and all were sold out!So to choose something was really difficult.However, the friendly waitress ( sorry, I didnt get the name) that served us, was very helpful and let us try a couple of their wines that were there to replace the sold out ones.So overall it was a bit of a disappointment this time...Would I come back? Maybe for some drinks and cheese.I hope that Lolla gets up to standards again
5
Great venue for Mediterranean tapas - not just Spanish. Great food and service. In terms of improvement, expand the wine menu and have a lunch price which is discounted. All in all a great venue
4
Very good food. The menu was tapas plates, which suited us fine. Basement room was cold, and we were not fond of community table, but we'd go back and highly recommend.
5
The Chef Kyle is an excellent and Innovative cook. He creates attractive dishes using fresh local ingredients with a European touch. The staff was friendly and you can watch the cooks as the expertly prepare the food and happily explain what they are doing.
5
Words cannot describe the food joy, but I will try! Honey. Ginger. Calamansi. Beetroot. Kale. Butter. Harissa. Lemon. Chocolate. Walnut. Salt. Caramel. **We chatted with one of the chefs behind the counter after our meal. She had created the Honey Harissa Grain Salad, which was my favourite. So I was able to give her my personal praise! Then she treated us to her delicious "failed experiment" which was something of a salted caramel chocolate bar. What a delight she was - I hope the head chef(s) / owners really nurture her talent because I will be back again to try her dishes!
5
This little place has innovative small plates covering a range of tastes, lots of style, attentive and competent service, interesting cocktails and good wine. We sat outside on the little pavement - small table for the 4 of us, but they brought just 1-2 dishes at a time for us to taste so the space did not matter, and more quiet than inside. Memorable were cos salad with bacon, spanish tortilla w smoked eel, leek fondant and pork collar. Great desserts. It really salvaged our short visit to Singapore
5
The food was great! Good quality of ingredients and they balanced each taste very well. The wine was expensive though and food was also at the expensive side but worth it. The staff were helpful and friendly. They were not shy to recommend what to order (to go with what we have already ordered)When we arrived we found out that our reserved table was in the basement - big tables with chairs around the table which we found it was uncomfortable hence we asked if we can move. The restaurant was fully booked that night but the staff said once the seats upstairs were available, she will move up which she did! Sitting upstairs at the counter is much nicer ambient and the chair was more comfortable.All in all, we like this place and will definitely go back.
4
Nic is possibly the most attentive server I've experienced in Singapore. She is friendly and thoughtful and added personal touches to our experience at Lolla. Lunch is easier as counter bookings are available. I find the reservation restrictions at night understandable but frustrating nonetheless. Walk ins only means that unless you want to eat at 6 PM you are very unlikely to land a decent seat. But the food is excellent and the wine list extensive. Would like to see a cheaper by the glass option for sparkling wine. Perhaps a prosecco? All in all a lovely contemporary dining option in the always fun Ann Siang Hill precinct.
5
It's my 4th time in Lolla and I must say they never fail to impress me every single time. From service to food - I wish I have 10 thumbs! My fav to date has got to be their scrambled egg with Bottarga di Muggine, Chutoro tartare, Hokkaido scallop carpaccio, braised beef tripe and a dish from the 'specials' menu, a semi spicy super fragrant snow crab in creamy sauce. The sea urchin pudding is a must order however not my favorite. Their lemon curd doughnuts and chocolate pudding would be the best dessert to end the meal, they managed to capture just the right amount of sweetness and the texture. Service was always friendly and helpful especially from a lady named Sufen. The chef will also take his time in explaining the dish's ingredients and a quick brief on how it's made if you happen to park a seat at the bar. There are always something exciting (almost like an adventure) and I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Lolla
1
Clearly the only point of this restaurant is for the staff to knock off early!!!! To hell with customers. Had some okay and unremarkable starters,anchovies in a tin and tomato salad.. Was told at 1.20 pm to hurry up and order more as the kitchen closes at 1.30!!!! The whole point of sitting at the smoky counter is to interact with the chefs but they were simply not interested.. just plonked the plate down without even looking at the customer... particularly the head chef... rude.Finished a bottle of wine and wanted a glass of red to finish the cheese.. was told we can only have it if we finished it and left 5 minutes later!!! We just left.Singapore is full of outstanding restaurants where the staff understand the notion of customer service.... Don't waste your time at this expensive,ordinary food and very rude restaurant whose sole objective seems to close its doors!!
5
I love dining and wining but it's not often I am willing to splurge but alas it was my fiancee's birthday and what better occasion to. The service was honest, warm and readily available. I pre-empted the restaurant that it was her birthday and complimentary glasses of champagne were at the ready once we were comfortably seated. We were given a walkthrough of the menu and ordered a generous amount of plates for two and a bottle of wine which I highly recommend, Isole e Olena Chianti Classico 2011. They have seasonal specials depending on the chef's creativity but the sea urchin, iberico ham, pork collar and burrata cheese dish were all winners. Rounded it up with a warm chocolate cake with a candle and an accompanying choir chorusing Happy Birthday rounded up a splendid evening. The meal was in the mid 300 which is pretty pricey but the plates were satiating and you definitely leave feeling satisfied, not hungering for supper after. Definitely worth a repeat visit on another special occasion
5
Food tasted so clean. Waiting staff was really friendly. Desserts are a must and so is the unforgettable sea urchin pudding. just plain yummy
5
There are so many original nice foods in this restaurant. I truly recommend for it. The place is not big, that is the point I do not like only.
4
This is the second time I have been to Lolla and I always enjoy the food. I love sitting at the counter where the open kitchen is and watch the chefs at work.
5
The highlight of Lolla has got to be the Sea urchin pudding-must order!! no words to describe the wonderful blend of squid ink pudding and fresh umi...we also had the Grass fed beef steak, which in the boy's words, was orgasmic>_< other items to try would be the Scrambled eggs with Bottarga di Mugine... and duck rillet, though the latter was probably not what we would go back for. Otherwise, we were seated at the bar seats, so we got to catch the chefs right in action...service was prompt and professional too. Overall, lovely dinner experience! Definitely will come back for the Sea urchin pudding
4
Must order: Sea Urchin with Black Squid Ink Pudding. Doughnut dessert with lemon curd.Sea urchin with black squid ink pudding is delicious and a unique menu. The taste is very rich though and I think it's better to share it to curb your cholestrol :)Doughnut with lemon curd is simple a delight. It's a light dessert with a refreshing taste of the lemon.Drawback is that the place is very small and packed but I would recommend you to try
5
OK, you have to try Lolla's signature Sea Urchin Pudding. Before you order anything else, check out the seasonal specials on the board around the counter where you will probably be sitting. The staff are all knowledgeable and friendly.Once you've done that, these are my top choices from the regular menu items:Beef tongue escalopes - tastes loads better than it sound to anyone who has not tried beef tongue. It's tender and very flavourful. Grilled Octopus - I have a penchant for grilled octopus and these guys do it really well. Actually, the kitchen is open concept so you'll see them grilling it. Duck Fat Potatoes - if you're gonna do it, go all the way
5
Young Ming, the chef, I want him to come back to Australia and teach people what food is about. The simple but very fresh ingredients become mind blowing journeys. The sea urchin pudding takes you places you have never thought of. We let Ming guide us thru the menu, suggesting dishes on our tastes, I'm going back for dinner. I just can't get enough of this place. He was so passionate about his food, he was in love. I could keep going but this is a place serious foodies need to experience. Oh and nickki you are a very passionate and capable waitress, you roc
4
We arrived close to 1.30pm for lunch n was prewarned that kitchen close at 1.45pm for last order. Only the counter seat are available, n we're glad to be able to watch the food preparations. It can get slight smokey, so if you r particular, do not take the counter seats.Proceeded to order a glass of Alvaro Palacios awesome red to start. We wanted to order two full portions of uni pudding but was kindly advised to share one or to get two half portions. Great recommendation because it was delicious but very very creamy. Uni was fresh and the squid ink pudding was rich. 2nd plate to share was the scallop carpaccio, it was fresh, succulent n light. Good contrast to the first dish. Next dish was on the daily special, sweet potato with pumpkin n ham. It was also good. We had tasted, rich n creamy, fresh n light and this third dish was slightly caramelisedwith the right amount of salt to add to the flavor, the pumpin seed and ham adds to the texture of the dish. Next on we had the braised beef tripe. This is absolutely yummy, our favorite dish so far. It was chewy and crunchy at the same time. As we're seated at the bar, it's easy to ask the chef how it was prepared. Apparently, they had braised the tripe first, in pork n veal jus. The final dish was the iberico pork collar. However, we did not really enjoy this one, we find that it was too fatty for our liking. The recommendation is too have it medium rare. The chef had assured us that it was normal for pork collar to be fatty. A case of preference I guess. We finished our meal with the chocolate pudding (it comes with vanilla ice cream!) and a scoop of lemon n ginger sorbet. Loved it. Oh and also a glass of Pedro Ximenex to pair with the dessert. What a great experience! We both left happy and very very full? Total damage: $267!Downside: we were asking them quite a bit of questions abt how the food is prepared. At first they were accommodating but I realized that they started giving barely there answers towards the end of the meal, probably because they are preparing to close and we're the last to leave. I'm giving them 4 stars for all but they should take note because the expressions showed on their faces :
5
I had no idea what to expect as this place was picked out by my hosts. Even they haven't visited before. But what a lovely surprise and treat it was for all of us. We tried out all the recommended dishes like the sea urchin pudding, which I was iffy about because my last encounter with sea urchin was not memorable. It was a put-the-teaspoon-down-and-roll-my-eyes-back-in-ecstasy good. The beef steak was melt-in-your-mouth perfection and the service was top notch
5
One of my all-time favorite restaurants in Singapore! The food is always exceptional and the service warm & friendly. Their famous sea urchin pudding is absolutely sublime (my mouth is watering just thinking about it) and the steak is probably the best I've had in Singapore - full of flavor and melts in your mouth. Their specials, which changes regularly, never disappoints. On a recent 'date night' with my husband, we ordered the charcoal grilled Alaskan king crab which was fantastic. I'm not a big eel fan (actually I usually dislike eel immensely) but we tried the tortilla with smoked eel - and to my surprise, I really enjoyed it! The food is not cheap but I think it's worth every single penny. I always walk away from Lolla with a happy belly and a happy heart. Oh and they have an extensive (lovely) wine list. I'm a firm believer that good food should be enjoyed with good wine

We visited Lolla last weekend and were pleasantly surprised. The ambience was lovely, relaxed but buzzy. I had pre-booked a table, but found out during the day that the only tables you can book are downstairs at the communal table. We didn't really want to do this, as the highlight of this restaurant was sitting upstairs at the preparation table - sort of like Tapanaki but Mediterranean food. The preparation was indeed amazing to watch and attention to detail amazing! We ate toooo much! I would recommend the lamb cutlets and also the leek gratin - simply gorgeous ... most of the specials looked fab. The quality of the food is very high and the service is good. Its intimate and fun - and recommended for couples. I am not sure how large groups would work - although I didn't view the table downstairs. I really liked this place and we will return again ..

Ming Tan and his team run a tight ship, in a tight space - so it definitely pays to book ahead. Sitting up at the bar you get to witness team Ming in action preparing house specialties such as sea urchin pudding and beef tongue escalopes. The food is flavour packed, intriguing and delicate all at once. The wine list is a real treat with some great choices by the glass. A place to come to solo or with friends - it works for all occasions. A little corner of Madrid in Singapore

Unfortunately for Lolla, I went to Vida Vino the evening before, and it was night and day between these 2Entered Lolla and it was a very large counter area seating. Decor was hip and i was excited15 minutes later, they remembered us! Came to took drink and food order. We ordered the duck rilletes, iberico pork collar, chicken + proscuitto, spanish tortilla + eel. the duck rilletes and iberico pork were good. The chicken seemed undercooked (yuck). The spanish tortilla seemed underwhelming as we are so spoiled with the yummy japanese cooked eel, this one seemed blandThroughout the meal, the servers never come to you to ask if you want another cocktail, or change out your plates since the gravy and leftovers from 3 different tapas have all interacted and made friends. It's just a very cold environment and you don't really feel welcome. Or servedSkipped dessert and more potential wine and left. Anyway it was already the same cost as Vida Vino and i certainly don't want to spend more her

When mentioning a couple of friends that we were going to visit Lolla, I heard "good but overpriced" a few times. Perhaps because we did not drink much, but we had a very pleasant dinner for two for about $65 each and we did not leave hungry. This is a good place. Our seats were downstairs, where some other reviewers mentioned they would be a bit sturdy. It is a counter-concept so fair enough. We were attended by "Alan", if I recall correctly, who was extremely attentive while not intrusive. Very good service. He suggested to order about four dishes. We did 5 between two, and and that was just perfect (mind you: we are decent eaters). On the side, we were given two (generous) samples of red wine: a portuguese and a spanish. Spanish it was, very good. The meal started with the crostini bread with San Marzano puree'. This dish, while pleasant, did not standout (the sauce while not bad, wasnt exceptionally tasting). We moved onto a cheesy suffle' which was very good and well presented, before the highlights of the meal: beef tongue and pork neck. Both extremely savory and interesting, while not overbearing. To finish off "lightly" we had the smoked scamorza (an italian cheese), that was ok (somewhat rare to find in Sing ). Definitely worth a visit

We had dinner at Lolla with a group of colleagues, so we sat in the basement (the AC was quiet cold for me). We have very nice "tapas", cooked with mediterranean influence, I recomend scallops, and chocolate molleux for desert. Service was good, we had a great night and will probably come back ! It is not cheap but stays accessible.Minus point is that seats were not comfortable, but the atmosphere is nice and trendy.To be recommended

Went to Lolla for my husband's birthday back in February. I am still dreaming about the leek gratin. Seriously, it was freakishly good. As a foodie, I admire the way all of the chefs work together in the kitchen. They make it look really easy to all cook in a small space, which I am sure it is NOT! We also had grilled calamari, the steak and gelato. Everything was wonderful, but again, do yourself a favor and get the leek gratin. Decent prices for Singapore, especially for such a highly rated restaurant. Enjoy

Was there for lunch last week. Managed to secure a seat at the bar to catch all the cooking action. Shared a half portion of the famous sea urchin pudding with my lunch companion. It lived up to the hype and more; the sea urchin came in a generous portion completely covering the black squid ink pudding beneath it. The sea urchin was fresh and firm while the pudding (the pudding!!) tasted like I was meeting George Clooney; smooth, sophisticated and sleek. Definitely deserves its star reputation at Lolla. At about S$20/- for half a portion, it was very good value. Wouldn’t recommend the full portion as it would be too rich for even 2 persons to finish it. The other tapas that we ordered i.e. duck’s breast, smoked eel tortilla and fried Italian greens, left an impression as well. Finished the meal with doughnuts served with lemon curd. The doughnuts were delicate little puffs of fried dough set off perfectly by the tartness of the lemon curd. Great value for money. Strongly recommend

Called in with my wife on a whim knowing nothing about the place. Was greeted by a lady who I got the feeling ran the joint. The menu was quite simple but everything we ordered was of a very high quality. Delicious rilletes, meat platter, duck fat potatoes and the chocolate dessert with the smokey ice cream was wonderful. They also have a very eclectic wine list featuring lots of boutique vineyards so if you want to try something different check it out. I also really liked the concept of being able to watch the food being prepared in front of your eyes. Great food, attentive service and good atmosphere. Would definitely go back

We have been there several times and every time we are impressed with the selection of daily specials available along with the menu favorites. The duck fat potatoes and scallop carpaccio as starters are not to be missed. If you are looking for something a bit more daring, the Sea Urchin Pudding is excellent. Main course of lamb, beef or fish are the best I have ever had. The wine & champagne selections are also outstanding. We love sitting at the food bar watching the food being prepared by the chef and his great team. We have been there at the start of the evening and also very late at night after the Eric Clapton concert. We just love the place and the food

"Sea Urchin Pudding?" "Thanks, but I think I'll pass" "Try it, I bet you'll like it" "Well, alright.." What a great decision that turned out to be! Right from the Sea Urchin Pudding to the Spanish Tortillas with smoked eel & Donuts with Lemon Curd to finish it all off, the lunch experience at Lolla was nothing short of amazing. Awesome food. Every single dish tasted excellent and seeing it getting prepared in front of you just adds to the experience. The food is rich and amazing with great tantalizing tastes. The service was excellent and the ambiance too is apt for a casual lunch or dinner. We came here for a business lunch and it exceeded our expectations. Slightly higher pricing with around $100 per person including wine. Highly recommended

fantastic food, every dish was outstanding but the steamed chocolate pudding, manchego and squid were particularly great. Service was fantastic, staff couldnt have been friendlier and more helpful. Great little place!

Wow that was a great night ! Food is suprising AND excellent. Tapas style with mediteraneen influence. The young chef is nice, passionated, humble and more importantly talented ! Definitely try the Donuts ( which are mor choux than dounuts) to perfectly end your dinner...We'll be back !

It's a foodie's mecca. Nuff said. The sea urchin pudding is a must try if you're an uni fan. Donuts with lemon curd is the ultimate finisher to the meal. Portions are small, so don't be afraid of over eating. Very healthy greens too. Pure and simply cooking that brings out the best flavours in the best produce

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatThe revival of Ann Siang Hill, with its smorgasbord of restaurants, have brought gleeful smiles to the hungry diners. One of the hottest restaurants is Lolla and i'm sure many of you have already heard/seen their signature Sea Urchin Pudding making its rounds on Instagram and Facebook.A long overdue catch up session with B provided an opportunity to check out this small but uber hip tapas bar. Reservations were made but it was only for the communal table in the basement. Thankfully we were early (7pm on a Wed) and managed to score seats at the most coveted spot in the restaurant- the 13-seat zinc-topped bar counter (walk ins only, except for lunch).The tapas dishes are a fusion of European and Japanese flavors. Portions are on the small side for some dishes but give yourself time (and tummy space) to decide and order along the way. B and i ordered the following to share.Sea Urchin Pudding ($19/half portion) is a must order. This is a rich, creamy, sweet and savory ink pudding adorned with tongues of creamy raw sea urchin. This 3 inch ramekin, though minute, is packed with decadent breakfast flavors. It is made from squid ink, egg yolks, cream and tomato sauce. The taste can get quite overpowering and we spent the whole night nursing it in between the other dishes. We can't fathom how people can even finish a half portion on their own.Another must order is the Scrambled eggs with Bottarga di Muggine ($22). We could taste every bit of the TLC Chef put into it. He stood there over the low fire and did not stop stirring for a good 3-5 minutes. Well, the results speak for itself.Instead of following the crowd and ordering the Grass fed Ribeye ($52), we opted for the Lamb cutlets ($28). This is by no means less inferior and turned out to be the highlight of our meal. The lamb is first seared and then finished in the oven, simply seasoned with salt and herbs and served in its own jus but oh that crust and oh that juicy tender meat. And i'm not even a lamb fan (i only have a weakness for lambskin). The dish is rather small, i wouldn't recommend sharing if you're not ordering many dishes.Dinner concluded on a high (from the sweetness) with the Steamed Dark Chocolate Pudding ($15). There is so much of that rich chocolate sauce with dark chocolate chunks on top of the cake. I thought the cake was a little dry that night though. Lolla is certainly going on my favorites list. B, who didn't have a good impression of Lolla, became a convert after this meal. All thanks to my stellar taste in food no doubt. Our bill was only $110 because we weren't up for more eating and drinks weren't included

Great combination of unique dishes, awesome flavors, and trendy yet chill vibe. Saw this place featured in the Wallstreet Journal and was happy to find it as good as the reviewers did. It's small and best for couples who want to cozy up at the social bar to eat and drink. And as popular as it is, I've always gotten a seat easily. Highly recommend this place as a regular hangout

Lolla serves up European and Jap fusion dishes in small plates perfect for sharing and tasting. It has a very unique setting and fuss free food, allowing a lot of interaction with other patrons as well as the open plan kitchen. If you decide to try the fabled Sea Urchin Pudding, be wary it is not for those with a weak tongue. You must be able to tolerate strong, rich flavours packed into a little thing. Like Chuck Norris' beard. Also try the steam chocolate pudding, its as if Angels frolicked through my tongue then rode the rainbow unicorn into my stomach.For the full legen-waitforit-dary review click below:http://sethlui.com/food-review-lolla

I was introduced to Lolla by a good friend who is a regular patron. So we were extra spoiled on the service part, I am sure. But the staff were very friendly anyway, and they seemed to be doing a great job with all their patrons. The food indeed I thought was special; nice innovative recipes and delicious tastes over and over again. Will definitely go back. Only one thing on the downside; they don't take reservations, So you need to get there by 6.30pm, otherwise there won't be any seats left

After all the hype about this place been the top tapas bar we had to try it. We had the sea urchin pudding which was good. It was rich and flavorful. The bread with tomato paste was average - 2 slices for an average size bowl of dip. The beef tongue is over rated, normal tasting and the dip did not add much to the flavor, the pickled cabbage at the side did add a nice contrast to the tongue but did not make up for what was lacking out of this dish. The duck fat potatoes were not too bad. We briefly considered ordering more mains but decided against it as the previous dishes were pretty average and we were not very hungry....Desert was doughnuts with lemon curd. This was the high light of the meal. I may consider going back for the sea urchin and doughnuts cause they are unique

Tasty food, great drinks, good crowd and wonderful ambience made this an enjoyable evening out. The waitress we had the pleasure to deal with was great, humorous, lovely and knowledgeable. The street and surrounding bars and restaurants are worth the visit anyway. If you end up at Lolla's regard yourself a lucky person

We thought we would try this place one evening and fell in love with it instantly! The food pairings and combinations are fantastic the quality of the food really high. We take friends here to try something special. Go early to avoid disappoint and to understand why it's currently rated as one of the best restaurants in the world
