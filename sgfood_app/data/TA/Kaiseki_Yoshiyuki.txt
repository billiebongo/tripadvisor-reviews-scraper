Have eaten there now many times. Chef Yoshi San is magic and always superb. Not cheap but never been disappointed at Private Room or Bar sittings

Kaiseiki Yoshiyuki is my all-time favourite kaiseki restaurant in Singapore. Everything from food (quality, taste, presentation, variety) and service to ambience is on point. Just perfection.
5
By far, our most memorable dinner at Home. Tea pairing …. very rare for a traditional Kaiseki restaurant outside Japan. Superb matching that brings out the subtle delicateness of every dish. Specially sourced by their service staff. Advance booking required. A wonderful experience!

Each visit better than the last! Both chef and food makes this a fantastic experience, part gastrnomic, part artistic.

During my visit I chose the 9 course Omakase menu called 'Hana'.The chef used chrysanthemum flowers in two of the courses, a first for me and not only colourful but also delicious.The highlight was the charcoal simmered tuna (oh-toro). The chef basically simmered the tuna by holding the charcoal above the plate (see photo below).There is one beer to choose from and a good selection of sakes, of which unfortunately, only a few are available by carafe.Overall it was a very good dinner and there was good conversation between the various guests and the chef

We had the omakase which is $320 per pax. It had a total of 14 courses from amuse bouche to fruits and desserts .  Generally all the ingredients used are of good quality . We were impressed with all of the fish courses served. The last course, which is crab with rice, was a little bland though . But its portion was generous enough to ensure you had a full meal.Presentation of food is not as refined and detailed as those kaiseki dinners we had in Japan. So was somewhat disappointed as there was no wow factors . Pretty plain presentations with minimal efforts for a kaiseki

One of the best Japanese restaurants I've been to ever. It's a small, cozy place with space for about 12 or so diners. It's tucked away in a little corner of the mall in the basement, and may be a bit hard to find, but it's worth looking for. I've been there twice without bookings and haven't had a problem, but both times I went a bit early and it did fill up later. Expect to spend a bit of money, but again, completely worth it. Probably the best meal I had in Singapore
5
Impeccable in all regards. If you find yourself anywhere within reach, make room in your schedule for this treat. The courses are a delicious procession of varied delights, each served with artistry and grace, but without pretension. Yoshikuki-san is a gracious host and a master of his craft, and his staff are likewise attentive and endearing. Not inexpensive, but if you measure life by unforgettable experiences, it's a bargain nonetheless

This is art at work in food. We had a set 8 course which came out over 1 hour and cost $138 per head ,before gst & service charge for the cheaper set !Pricey but a taste that linger in your thoughts , with freshest sashimi as well as cooked in soup ！Fine dining indeed 
5
What a wonderful restaurant. One would think one is in Japan. The service is great and the Chef is very creative. Not cheap but worth every penny.
5
I would highly recommend Yoshiyuki. The sushi was awesome. The service was outstanding and the presentation of the food was excellent.
5
Traditional Japanese haute cuisine. Kyoto style kaiseki ryori in kappo setting. We like Chef Yoshi's delicate dashi. Umami !
5
Chef and servers are super friendly, very professional and accommodating to meal preference. It was a very fulfilling lunch. I ordered a 5 course meal for lunch and i was really full. Not sure how the people could finish the 7 course lunch.
5
A unique Omakase dinning experience with a very attentive staff. You need to try very hard to find the entrance to this hidden jem.

There are three options for lunch: we decided on the priciest $180++ omakase menu. The space is beautiful and quite dramatic. Softly lit too. Each course is beautifully and carefully prepared: we had yuba (delicate tofu skin) with uni and fresh wasabi, appetizer of lily root balls, smokey dashi clear soup with a beautiful white fleshed fish in it, flounder sashimi (Karei), toro sashimi with soya sauce foam (very molecular!) and cubes of akami, various grilled fish, one with rice like a nigiri sushi but sitting in a bowl of stock, and the filler dish of steamed rice and baby sardines and delicious pickles and soup. Dessert was a wafer like ice cream and as a birthday treat, Japanese fruits and a Sakura mochi were presented. Yoshiyuki-San was very polite and quite friendly. His other chef spoke better English and also engaged with guests. We enjoyed ourselves, and it was lovely to have a kaiseki meal so like the ones we had in Japan -- beautiful small dishes, carefully crafted reflecting the season (it's spring!) and showcasing pretty cutlery and tableware. A treat
5
Cons: it's expensive set menus, pros: unique, fresh and incredibly well put together Japanese cuisine. You get what you pay for which is key. The head chef is friendly, charming and makes you feel welcome in his working space. It's slightly more casual then some we've been to, and the service is a little messy when busy, but it's made up for by the food and the atmosphere
5
Had the Hana Omakase. Counter seating for about 13 only. They have a separate section that's an Izakaya.The Omakase was simply great. Fresh ingredients and perfect plating. Each dish was light and extremely flavourful. The dessert of strawberry and musk melon was the best I have ever tasted - extraordinary.Great atmosphere to boot
4
This was a lunch treat from me to a mentor. Felt that the quality of the dishes overall was decent (not as mindblowing as those I had in kyoto for a lower cost), only that the rice course was a little dismal/lacking flavour and uninspired so we both did not finish that one course
5
We came and there was no wait staff so warning bells went off. Those were false. It was absolutely the best!!! This is not a place where there is loads of sashimi and sushi for their omakase menu, rather every dish is beautifully crafted & exquisite. Not only that, the chef is very charming (despite the limited English ) keeps giving us free titbits and so courteous. Highly recommended
5
Love how cosy it was ... Chef Y was very charming and tried to communicate to every single of the guests despite his limits English
5
Having tried Kaiseki in Kyoto before, this is the closest you can get in Singapore. Food was exquisite and service attentive. Rooting for them to get at least a Michelin star or more!
5
one of the best kaieki experiences in Singapore. food service and ambience were all exceptional. will definitely go back again
5
My 3rd visit and I will continue to come back to this restaurant on a regular basis as it is truly satisfying. Very good service and excellent gourmet food
3
For lunch, I think the $128+ set could do with more seafood that's why I am giving it an average although that's just my opinion. Overall, the food was tasty judging from comments by the other reviewers as well. Service was attentive and Head Chef Yoshi is friendly. Go with the warm sake
5
We had the $328++ omakase which was absolutely delightful. Better than Ki-sho, Shinji and Aoki. And comparable to some of the best kaisekis we've had in Japan. (Though not as spectacular as Kikinoi, but then again that had three Michelin stars) I bet when Michelin comes to Singapore next year it will get at least a star or two. We'll be back!

This is Kyoto based kaiseki. Its clean, not too much salt, focuses on the season and exquisite. Although, i prefer stronger flavours, the food is reminisce of a meal in a ryokan. The only sad thing, is that there is no hot spring there. I think the flavour would be more appreciated if it was so.That said, this is a good restaurant. The Head Chef Yoshiyuki is affable and has great action in this speech. This is matched by his other chef as well. The ambience of the restaurant is truly artful, the decor makes you feel like you are in japan. The interior design is something that rivals that of Hashi (which is now closed).There are some outstanding dishes at Yoshiyuki. namely the grilled sanma or pacific saury. This fish is hard to cook, often fishy and bone. Yet, Yoshiyuki's version is not fishy, has a taste of perfectly chargrilled sardine flavour though its not, fillet wrapped upon each other. I had cravings for this recently and i could still taste it in my mouth. A great Japanese restaurant does this for me, you can still taste the food after you eat it.The ponzu jelly on hirame was a nice touch and approach to ponzu as a sauce. So was the soya sauce foam on chu toro as well. Its creative, and the texture brought out more fun from the fish.I understand they started don buri for lunch but i would say the 88 or 128 sgd omakase sets for lunch is good too. The dearer set has two different dishes from the 88 but i would say the 88 is a good taste of Yoshiyuki's skills.Order the sake whilst you are at it. You will be surprised by the way its served. Makes you feel like a Japanese feudal lord. Be surprised here

For a delightful kaiseki adventure, do spare time (two hours is a rough estimate) and splurge where it's worthwhile! Surely we know how lousy it feels to spend good money yet walk away feeling less than satisfied with what may have been lauded and praised as a wonderful dining experience. Yoshiyuki does not disappoint, cliched as that might sound; food is meticulously prepared and ingeniously created with the freshest of available ingredients so each visit is a discovery of more gastronomical delights. Each dish is a feast for the eyes first and then a carefully orchestrated harmony of tastes, a revelation to our tastebuds, an adventure to be relished. Service is pleasant and non-intrusive and the chefs, welcoming, thoughtful and passionate about their craft

Well this place deserves a spot on any Japanese foodie list in Singapore. It is however for the purist Kyoto-cuisine lover. Its clean flavours, delicately prepared with precision, and dedication. They've been at is for years, and they know what they are doing.We had the large Keiseke menu, and its great. paired with a sake that was right on.Its not Japanese as foreigners know it, but its authentic, and regional, and 100% delightful

Being back for the second time, i am still in awe by the level of service and the quality of food. Freshness of food is ensured which is flown in from Japan twice weekly. If you wish to avoid the crowd, Tuesday and Wednesday is the best time to go. Chef Yoshiyuki is really friendly and personal, interacting with dinning guests and making sure they are comfortable. Incredible attention to details, every slice and cut is almost an artwork to the eye. Service was also impeccable, with the waiter just round the corner whenever i needed something. The dining experience is enhanced with the explanation of each dish as well as the tools used by the chef. Do set aside 2 hours for the dinner and immerse in the authentic kaiseki experience
5
My friend and I had an excellent meal at Yoshiyuki. The food was fresh and delicious and presented, beautifully. The head chef, Yoshi Kashiwabara, was gracious and is highly skilled. Service was excellent too.
Wonderful, Wonderful meal.

I made this restaruant reservation for my boss business trip without visit experience. After the dinner my boss whatsapp to me immediate and praised the restaurant and said unexpectedly good Japanese restaurant.
4
Food and Sake are nice. Dishes are very beautifully decorated. Excellent personal services by the Head Chef Yoshi Kashiwabara San and his Japanese lady serving staff (did not ask for her name) who can speak 3 languages (Japanese, English and Mandarin).
5
took the $288++ menu. Interesting, fresh ingredients done with skill and attention. Enjoyed thoroughly. Occasionally felt one or two dishes were a more bland than we'd like, and couple a tad salty due to too much sauce. otherwise there's very little to fault what would be considered a near perfect execution. Would certainly recommend this place.Its a tough choice if forced to choose between this Yoshiyuki, ME@OUE and Shinji. They have become my pinnacle fave places for kaiseki Jap food in Singapore.Try them all and make up your own mind. None of them would disappoint

To celebrate my sister's birthday, we had lunch at Yoshiyuki. Both of us enjoyed every dish of today's lunch. Out of all the dishes, I like the starter - fresh Yuba (bean curb skin), so smooth and tender. Today sashimi are Tai and Akami Toro. The Toro slices are so fresh and tender. The best Toro I ever tried. The tea rice was so nice I could not resist Yoshi san offered me 2nd bowl of tea rice. The meal ended with a nice dessert - Kyoto vanilla ice-cream with red beam paste. Yoshi san is friendly and the waitress services are good. So far this is best Japanese restaurant I ever tried in Singapore. My sister and I will sure be back to this restaurant again
4
The chic and discrete dining room of Yoshiyuki is like a different world to the noisy Forum mall outside. Kaiseki is not to everybody's taste because it is not sufficiently 'spectacular' for some; but Yoshiyuki-san's (like chef Goto, a former head chef to the Japanese ambassador to Singapore) cuisine is exquisitely subtle and clean in taste. Very good sake. Service is excellent - they even replace your 3/4-fullcup of tea to keep it warm. Quality comes at a price, but it's reasonable compared to the top sushi restaurants in Singapore (where prices can be characterised as outrageous.
4
Occasionally will dine here. Advice to make reservation in much advance, seats are limited. There are 2 sets of dinner menu $238++ or $288++, if you are small eater, please go for $238 in order fro you to enjoy every course. I enjoy his presentation of each course. If you cant finish the "claypot" rice, you may take away. Chef will pack it in Japanese style for you to take away...Chef Yoshi's special dessert " mua chi" is so yummy and still warm because he will make ala minute. I like it because the food there are authentic "kaiseki"
4
Liked: the ambience, service, food quality - "best in Japan" for everything - fish, meat right down to yams, exquisite food presentation, exclusive seating at counter dining for just our group.Disliked: extremely high priced, foreign chef as foreign talent, noise of children's programs outside reeking in, no one else there at lunchtime?Note: We were gracious guests at someone's birthday party

Located at an obscure corner at the basement (behind escalators underneath Forum Galleria's taxi stand) & with its dark interiors at the entrance, i had wondered if this was a real japanese restaurant which usually tend to be more conspicuous & brightly lit. Only counter seating available. The chef Mr Yoshiyuki himself personally greets & explains the 2 set menus which are about 5 or 7 course meals respectively priced at $88 & $128 per pax. Each dish is painstakingly presented with the season's best ingredients of fish or seafood or vegetables, direct from Japan. Mostly cooked dishes but if one cannot take raw fish, the chef is happy to substitute for something cooked. I enjoyed every dish served in slightly bigger than bite-sized. The adjoining western bar where the restrooms are located is chic & pleasant, although not used during the day. Overall, worth coming back again
5
Wonderful restaurant, where the quality of the food and the atmosphere rivalled similar establishments in Tokyo. The quality of the ingredients, and the simplicity of the presentation were outstanding. Excellent service levels by staff clearly enjoying what they do. Not cheap, but worth it for special occasions
