Good restaurant for dim sum. Each portion is $3.40, $4.40 or $5.40. We had 15 portions (2 young adults and one middle aged). All 3 would burst if we'd order one more portion! We enjoyed every single one! Almost $30 pp.

There are just way too many good Chinese restaurants in Singapore to eat at this one. The food is definitely below average. Service very efficient though and the restaurant is situated in a nice part of Singapore at the arts gallery.

This time I came here for an appreciation dinner hosted by my Citizen Consultative Committee (CCC) Chairman. It was not held within the premises of the restaurant but in a beautifully decorated tentage set up near the side entrance of the country club. I was taken aback by the grand set up as the previous two occasions the appreciation dinners were held on the second floor of the restaurant premises. Nevertheless, I found this secluded area was exclusively conducive and relaxing for our event as we could drink and talk aloud to our pleasure.Before the actual dinner was prepared, we were served with peanuts and sliced fresh fruits. Soothing music was played in the background and we had a wonderful networking session with other grassroots leaders.I like the bowl of tonic chicken soup with abalone and scallop, very nutritious. There is also a big plate of `loh hei' where we stirred aloud heartily for prosperity and good health. The piece of rib meat served was tender and palatable. The plate of celery fried with prawns was greenly delicious. The small packet of lotus leaf wrapped up with fried rice was tempting and even though my stomach was too full to add in more, I still finished it up and leave no remnant on the table. The few waitresses who served us were very efficient and courteous. They cut the fish for us and never slipped their mind to serve us the drink and wine. I had an enjoyable networking night with my grassroots brothers and sisters. The atmosphere was just nice and the food wonderful for our gathering. I would like to thank my CCC Chairman for his generosity and also to the restaurant for serving us the awesome food and rendered us the excellent service. We will come again

There were 9 of us but we elected to have the set menu for 8 person.The food was plentiful! And the quality of the food and preparation was of a very high standard. The Peking Duck was excellent; duck skin was crispy and not oily; the crepe was thin and soft. Fish maw and Sea Cucumber Soup was full flavored WITHOUT the usual MSG taste while affording a generous helping of fresh sea cucumber. Crispy Fried Chicken with Yam was excellent, crispy and soft at the same time.Prawns in the Cereal Prawn were rather large.The Steam Fish was huge, we all wondered how much a fish of that size would cost if we ordered it separately or if we ordered it in another restaurant.Duck meat from the Peking Duck was cooked with mushrooms and leek.Fried Rice was cooked with Egg White and not the whole egg, freshly pleasant. Dessert was simply Honeydew Sago, just light enough to top off an excellent dinner at an excellent price!We feel that prices were like or below typical coffee shop Tze Char prices while quality was that of mid to high end restaurants.Service was very good with friendly staff always on the look out to be of service

Called to make a reservation and was told that there is dress code for this restaurant - no flip flop and shorts. Were quite surprised to see a full-housed restaurant at around 12:30pm on a Sunday. Luckily we made the reservation. Have to wait for a while before a baby high chair is available. The regular dim sum is served from the push cart. Overall the service and the food are nice

The 16 of us went to the restaurant for a farewell lunch for our colleague who will be transferred to another unit. This is not the first time I came to this restaurant. Parking is free and the restaurant is located at the second floor of the clubhouse of Warren Golf & Country Club. The ambience in the restaurant is conducive for a dim sum chit chat session over cups of Chinese tea. The service was prompt and the waitresses removed our empty plates almost immediately. Our cups of tea were also topped up almost instantly. The supervisor was quick to take orders and made good suggestions for the food. They were also all very well-attired and presentable. I also met my grassroots patrons and neighbors at the restaurant who came here with their colleagues to have their lunch. I think there must be plus factors that attracted them here. I personally find the dim sum delicacies `freshly baked' without any `refrigerator' smell. I remember I ever tasted dim sum in a coffee shop in Penang where the meat seem to be cold and stale appeared to be just out from the refrigerator. Of the dishes, I particularly like the chicken feet meat which is very tender and soft. The `siew mai' pork and shrimp dumplings were `juicy' and flavorful. The pork buns were fluffy and the char siew paste well cooked. The fried sotong balls also tasted good. While the monosodium and sodium content in most Chinese dishes are high, I found the dishes here not really salty and that is good. We have a hearty conversation among ourselves in the restaurant and I think the service provided is undeniably good. The price is also reasonable. The bill is $355 for the 16 of us in two tables and it works out to about $22/- per person
