Food of the highest quality using fresh produce and ingredients that is pleasing to your palate. Lovely plating and flavours. Highly recommended

Great french food which is good value for money when you are out for fine dining. Menu keeps changing which makes me go there again and again.

This being a one Michelin star restaurant, I did not get the wow factor I was expecting.
The food was very good, but not sensational.
The atmosphere in the private dining room upstairs was somewhat bland.
Overall it was missing the wow factor

It was a birthday surprise dinner arranged by my husband. In general, a fine dining restaurant won’t accept children yet we were glad that the manager made an exception on my special day.The food was excellent and impeccable! We had the tasting menu and the waygu beef tenderloin was delicious! My daughter, who’s a picky eater finished her roasted duck by herself! The overall experience was great and we will come back again.Highly recommended

Based on a TripAdvisor recommendation, we invited an important client to this restaurant for dinner. Not exactly sure what to expect, we were overall very pleased with the outcome.Situated on a small street, the setting inside is nothing fancy - just 7 simple tables with table cloths - so it is very intimate. The service was good (although, at times, a little hard to understand our waitress's English). The wine choices were excellent. An open kitchen allows diners to see what is happening with food preparation.The menu is limited to about 5-6 items for each part of the meal: starter, main, and dessert. I was personally disappointed by the lack of variety in vegetarian options, so I ended up ordering the only two options I could: the beetroot for the starter and the zucchini flowers with quinoa for the main. The beetroot was tasty; the zucchini flower was "alright" - quite salty in taste. But, of course, it was creative (see the photo), so that was enjoyable to see.For dessert, I decided to try the rhubarb... after all, I figured that must be the secret to the name of the restaurant. There is a big "surprise" on the rhubarb - it is sprinkled with popping candy which went off in my head like fireworks. My table mates didn't believe me, so I had them try it, too. We were all quite dumbfounded by it, honestly. Certainly unexpected of a Michelin Star restaurant. While it made for an interesting conversation, I'm not sure it offered much in the way of taste. We may or may not go back again, but our Rhubarb meal was all in all a positive experience

Charming restaurant, but food was just okay and not as good as expected. We were wondering how can this restaurant received such a high ratings on trip advisor. The service was cold, liked a robot with software issues and quite surly - especially from the lady waiter.

I have dined at Rhubarb the last 3 times I have been in Singapore and each time find more to recommend this wonderful, intimate and friendly place where Paul Longworth and team turn out creative, beautiful and extraordinarily tasty cuisine, and Jerome DesFonds runs an efficient and welcoming front of the house, presenting interesting wines to accompany Chef Longworth's delightful cooking. I've written other reviews of Rhubarb which I invite readers to read, so I won't wax as eloquent as Rhubarb really deserves here other than to say this is a "must visit" restaurant in Singapore

In Singapore for Christmas so we took the opportunity to check out some of the great restaurants. Visited Rhubarb on Boxing Day - an small dining space with 7 tables, an open kitchen and a Christmas Tree with a mixed group of diners from couples, friends, and business. Attentive staff, beautiful table settings and despite the small space and number of people a sense of privacy and intimacy.We were a bit unsure as to which wine to go with having 3 we were thing about but it was suggested that one of them would better go with our various dishes - we took the suggestion and it was spot on.The food was special - but the Rhubarb and Custard was nothing like my childhood memories (thank goodness) - it is worth going back to Singapore for!Thank you to Chef and all staff for making it a Boxing Day meal we will remember

The dishes here are all attractively presented, the small number of tables are well-spaced & comfortable and the staff friendly & attentive.The food is good but not fantastic (maybe we set our expectation too high, given it's one Michelin star?!). The Wagyu beef was excellent though
4
Small restaurant but tables are well spaced out which allows for good conversation. We had the 5 course dinner , the truffle onion soufflé soup and scallops are amazing, in fact every course are well presented and taste great. Will add on to my ‘ restaurant list.
4
Cold service but the food was great. Went there with our friends from overseas and they enjoyed. Pan fried foie gras was absolutely delicious and juicy. My wife had Endive salad also pretty good.
5
We loved this restaurant. Dessert was amazing and dishes surprised us in a very positive way. Both presentation and taste was outstanding.
4
We chose the surprise menu for the lunch .
4 courses (2 starters).
Very good French cuisine with some locals ingredients.
Service efficient , diligent
Very nice wine list (French wines mostly).
Very good place for a business lunch
Quiet (only 7 tables).
Definitely recommended.

Rhubarb is a place you must visit to try some great food. with michelin star. its one of the best restaurants in town.
5
Hidden in the duxton area, rhubarb only served a handful of table each time. The open kitchen very close to the dining area give a sense of welcoming and friendly atmosphere. Everyone in very attentive and helpful. The menu itself will blow you away, a big surprise in every bite because what it seems visually, quite different in taste than what you’d expected. The combination of flavour, the texture and the presentation ~ all are very inventive. Compliment to the chef.Make a reservation beforehand, because this place is very popular and easily full.
5
With the arrival of Rhubarb on the Singapore restaurant scene this hails a new beginning to excellence.The partnership of an English chef and a French Maître d seems on the face of it to be the wrong way round but it works. The food we ate on our visit was second to none, the attention to the origins and quality of all ingredients made the completed dishes sublime.Only 7 tables but the service and knowledge of each of the waiters was excellent as was the open kitchen. The chefs on view creating such quality dishes deserve praiseThe wine list was very varied and some excellent quality wines at very reasonable prices for this standard of restaurant.I am sure if this standard is maintained Rhubarb is here to stay for a long time

We were looking forward to dine at Rhubarb and indeed the food did not disappoint. The highlights for us were the quail, braised beef cheek and most definitely the foie gras which we were strongly discouraged from ordering (thankfully we went ahead!). The good food is overshadowed by the disappointing service from the Chinese female waitress with short hair. This is the first time I feel so pressured at a fine dining establishment to give a whole list of foods I do not consume. I actually do not have food allergies but am just very selective. However she insisted repeatedly I give her the whole list of foods I do not consume, hinting that she does not want me to send any food back to the kitchen. When a diner assures you it is ok, please do not further probe repeatedly. Probably she is too fearful I may collapse on the floor but if I have food allergies, I would definitely have advised earlier.After enjoying the main course, we ordered a foie gras which we enquired how it is prepared. The waitress proceeded to explain what the foie gras is paired with - daikon, smoked sturgeon & horseradish. We jolly well know what is sturgeon - you don't have to tell us it is a fish (duh!) The part we feel insulted is that she says the flavour profile is very different from the usual foie gras served elsewhere and tried to dissuade us from ordering it. (hinting again she does not want us to send food back to the kitchen)To the waitress - Please do some research and pay a visit to your industry colleagues at Joel Robouchon, Odette, Jaan, or your nearby neighbours Tippling Club or Etna to understand what is the acceptable service standard

My wife and I had dinner here on Halloween, to celebrate my 60th birthday. All we can say, is that this celebration will stay with us long into future. We had the chef’s menu with wine accompaniment, both being out standing and we’ll match! Chef Paul, spends just enough time at each table, of which there are only 7, explaining his dishes and the ingredients to you. Jerome helps you understand the wines and why they go with the dish, this includes a little quite, as he asks you to tell him, what you think your first drink is? My highlight of the meal, was the white onion emulsion and for my wife, it had to be the scallops! If looking for French fine dining in a relaxed atmosphere, then we suggest, look no further then “Rhubarb Le Restaurant
5
We went there for dinner and this place deserves its Michelin Star, the food was excellent, we had the candied beets and seared duck liver followed by the lamb and wygua, everything was perfect, Jerome picked us a great wine from the extensive wine list. This place is a must for any serious foodie, make sure you book as seating is limited. Great touch having the chef come and explain the meals when served. There is a tasting menu which I would try next time

It took me a while to decide how to rate Rhubarb. It promised so much, yet somehow did not fully deliver. The set lunch menu is decidedly good value, especially so as the place has been given a Michelin star. The food was very good, but not sensational. The duck breast with plums was a bit tough for me. However, the other courses were very good. The wine list was also very good, both extensive and expensive. The place is somewhat bland and the staff displayed varying levels of attentiveness
4
A great atmosphere with a beautiful menu that customised my dishes to vegetarian. Thank you very much for the fantastic dishes and delicious wine :)
5
We had the degustation menu, and it was very delicious and beautifully presented. The service was also excellent. This was our 2nd time in Rhubarb and will definitely go back again.
5
I had a very good and pleasant experience at Rhubarb restaurant, the food was excellent and great service, the price is good for the quality of the restaurant.
I recommande all the dishes.
5
A place with very good food with reasonable prices.The quality, creativity and service was way above my expectations .
5
If you really want to give your self a gift and share with your loved ones, this is the right place todo it the decoration of the restaurant, the ambience inviting to have a great dinner, the wine selection for pairing the food was excellent by the sommelier direction and when they send the hors d'oeuvre appetizer, a explosion of texture and flavors make the great open for the subsequent dishes you can explore the full menu or follows the chefs suggestion you never regret, the pigeon, lamb or beef spectacular.The desserts and coffee also at same level, the Michelin star was not for free this place really deserves it.I became a frequent visitor because I like this level of service, ambience and food.This is a must for m
5
My God. This is a very small place and looks unasumming but the Chef's menu is like, wow! It's a long journey of degustation menu but rewarding at best! My fav are Emulsion and Toothfish. Apricot dessert was awesome too. My only suggestion is maybe to update the decor and make it more fresh and simple. Also the website is, sorry, kinda of ugly
5
I had the set lunch at $48++ while my husband had the chef surprise at $78++. Food is delicious and beautifully presented. Excellent value especially for the set lunch. I felt that the chef surprise menu did not offer a lot more. I will definitely return but I will stick to the set lunch. Service is very good though I find that the staff are a little too formal. Overall I will highly recommend this restaurant
5
Fantastic Experience.True attention to details, amazing advice for the wine with wide range including good value for money.Food is exceptional, and we feel reminiscent of when Joel Robuchon was launching his Ateliers restaurant, with sophisticated yet genuine food with a dash of controlled creativity.The service is what you expect with a Michelin level French restaurant: a bit stiff at first and it opens when you show a bit of interest in the food and wine. Similar to a nice burgundy that needs a bit of decanting. The chef manages to be creative yet not fall into directionless fusion food. There is a clear direction, a journey in each of the dishes meticulously prepared. We feel the effort, and that's good sometimes to see that you have people not laid back about what you are served.Went there for anniversary wedding, and I wish I could go more often as I don;t think it would alter the magic.Quality is the result of intelligent effort, which is the very definition of French culture to me.Probably my top favorite fine dining restaurant in Singapore
5
We set here for lunch. This is a cozy restaurant and we ordered a chef menu. Special chef menu is a 4 course meal where the chef will decide what he will serve depending on the ingredients he has that day. The food served is delicious abd worth every cent we paid
5
I chose to return to Rhubard as part of another trip to Singapore and as before I could find no fault in my decision. The food was delicious and the staff professional and attentive. My first try at pigeon and it was spectacular. The duck fois gras was delicious. This is a high-end restaurant in terms of pricing but you won't be disappointed. A meal here is worth every cent
5
Very impressive dinner we had.
Every course was an eye opener with a good wine list to match.
Service was tip top too.
Highly recommended.
5
Had a dinner meeting here. From service to food quality I must say its the best! The food was served with a smile. That's a plus.

I visited Rhubarb with a friend for a midweek lunchtime treat. Although the restaurant is small (with only seven tables), the dining room is airy and nicely decorated. The addition of an open kitchen also gives a nice intimate feel. My friend and I opted for the 3 course lunch menu for $48 which represented fantastic value given the quality of food we received. I chose the truffle pork ballotine to start, followed by the braised beef bourguignon for main and the chocolate creme brûlée for desert. All dishes were beautifully crafted with flavours that lived up to their appearance. We also received an amuse bouche and beautiful petit fours with our coffee. In addition to the faultless food we received exemplary service from start to finish, which although should be a given in such a fine dining establishment, I find many similar restaurants in a Singapore let themselves down in this area. Full marks Rhubarb.

My husband insisted that we had to celebrate my birthday by having dinner at this place. I wasn't very keen as degustation menu was always too much food for me. There was also the ala carte menu but somehow, when there is a choice for the degustation menu, it is hard to resist. So that was what we opted for.The amuse bouche was tiny and can be easily popped into the mouth. Then came the Japanese scallop which was red in the colour from the rhubarb and strawberry. Next was the green pea emulsion - told to scoop to eat like solids instead of drinking it like soup. I enjoyed it although it was not warm enough. I do prefer soup that is served warm or hot. Next was the foie gras...it was fine but have never been a fan. I opted for the toothfish for my main and my husband, the wagyu. The toothfish was fine but was not wowed. The wagyu was disappointingly chewy. We ordered half bottles of french wine and champagne to go along with the food rather than the wine pairing. My husband had organized a surprise for my birthday but it came in the form of the dessert already on the menu with a Birthday wish scribbled in French. It was very low key, no candle, no fuss. I don't mind the zero fuss but where was the candle? Could they not find one? Will the smoke alarm or detector be triggered by the smoke from the tiny candle? I thought it weird that the restaurant did not put any more effort into making the birthday dinner more memorable or special. My husband could have been given a heads up to BYO his own candle :-)The chef himself did personally serve us some of the dishes and spent some time explaining which was a nice touch. I forgot to mention that the dessert was white chocolate with popcorns. I guess I was too shocked at the candleless birthday surprise to even notice what was served along with how they tasted. Had to refer to the menu to re-jog my memory. The coffee and tea were next along with the petit four. I thought perhaps there was another surprise being saved for last but nope, nothing. Although prettily served, the food was not all a hit with us (e.g. the mains). They were also not warm when served. Apart from the friendly tall French gentleman who served us our drinks and who was very efficient in his service, I don't have other nice things to say about the place....which is a shame when there have been so many good reviews written about it

What a lovely place, only 7 tables for a real personal feel.We went for our anniversary and had the set menu with the wine pairing, which was a great decision.The food was simply amazing, delicious and cooked to perfection. Some of the courses were light and fluffy with startling flavour that was a delight to the senses.The wine complemented the food in such a way to enhance the flavour, I know that this is what it is meant to do, but the idea falls short at many restaurants, but not at Rhubarb. Added to this the surprises in the wine pairing, I would highly recommend taking up the option.The Chef came out of the kitchen to deliver some of the dishes and to explain a bit about how they were made and sourced, showing that they really care about the customer experience and that they want the customers to appreciate the food to the fullest.To top it off the Sommelier was friendly, informative and witty, he was able to provide interesting information about the wines, whilst keeping it interesting.A great night at Rhubarb, thank you for making it so memorable
5
Food in parts 6* Never before have I called anything perfect. The pea emulsion, the wagyu, the smoked potatoes all were. As were so constituent parts of dishes. Amazing. That would be enough for 5*. However the service also merirs 6*, and the matching wine menu too. My vocabulary is too poor for Rhubarb.
5
Been there for Boyfriend bday and we were not disappointed! The food is amazing and so is the service. The Chef came to check on us at the end of our dinner and brought the dessert himself - which make you feel special :) Highly recommended especially the rhubarb dessert! Book in advance if possible since the place is quite small
5
I went there with 2 friends. We ordered the set lunch and tried to pick différents dishes in order to have a 360 view on the proposed set.Each of us lived an exquisite experience regardless of the choice (vegetable, seafood, poultry or meat based). We ordered a Cornas from Mathieu Barret (hard to find a place proposing such wine in Southeast Asia) which was excellent and luckily we ordered it first and carafed it at once as it took an hour to the wine to reach its apogee. F&B wise, rhubarb is surely one of the very best french restaurants in Singapore. But what makes me want to come again is that the service headed by Mr Jerome is exactly the same as any Michelin starred restaurant in Paris. And the management wisely chose furnitures and tapestry that absorb noises so, unlike most fine dining venues in shop houses, you will enjoy your meal in a pleasant and reasonably quiet atmosphere.I sometimes don't get a table even if I call a week in advance so do book as early as possible.
5
I've lived in Singapore for a year and eaten out regularly, and Rhubarb is definitely my best meal so far. Small and well decorated, smart yet welcoming, the only sensible option is the tasting menu with wine pairings. The scallop with rhubarb and strawberry is sweet and fresh like a dessert; the pea emulsion is amazing; as was the foie gras, beef and apricot actual dessert. The French wines are unusual, well-sourced, and perfectly paired. For the level of quality the price is reasonable. This is a journey, a story; the chef and manager/sommelier take you on a journey of sumptuous taste, a journey well worth going on and one we will take again
5
Fantastic little restaurant - only 7 tables.You can see into the kitchen and see what is going on - the chef even brings out some dishes. Lovely service, very attentive, discreet - lovely atmosphere with good lighting and music. I would go back any time
5
Haven't had a bad meal here nor been unhappy with the service yet. Keep it up! Creative dishes, impeccable service, superb wine list
5
My second visit to this great restaurant, it remains one of the best modern French restaurant in town. As always, please reserve a table to avoid disappointments
5
This restaurant is perfect and a must visit in Singapore. Dishes were delicious, creative and perfectly designed to balance flavours. The wait staff are exceptional - professional, knowledgeable and warm. The chef was lovely and farewelled each guest. Couldn't recommend highly enough.
5
Everything was perfect from the Amuse Bouche to the dessert , from the quality of the food to the service . Great experience , worth the Michelin Star . Highly recommended.
5
This is a gastronomic experience, not just a bite to eat, but it is unpretentious and friendly and well-priced relative to quality. We were very happy with the wine recommendation, which was from a region we don't know well (Languedoc), and we enjoyed the friendly, but not intrusive, sommelier (whom I believe is also an owner and manager). The dishes were creative, cooked to perfection and beautifully presented. Go for a special treat.
5
I had the pleasure of dinning here with my wife. Despite awkward dietary requirements the chef still obliged us with a tasting menu that can only be described with superlatives. Each course was a delight.The wine list was for a restaurant of this quality good value and resulted in us treating ourselves to a Mouton Rothschild. Jerome kindly followed my decanting preferences.I can only say that while this was our first visit it will most certainly not be our last. Thank you for a fantastic evening
5
I dined at Rhubarb last year and had a wonderful meal, made special by the attention and friendliness of chef Paul Longworth and his partner Jerome Desfonds, who organizes the front and is a knowledgeable sommelier. This time I had the set menu with wine pairings. You can see the menu on their website. There was not a dish on the menu that did not work wonderfully, with complex interminglings of flavors and textures creating a unique and wonderful dining experience. The wines selected by Jerome were also superb--including two very rare reds--but also a terrific Meursault! I cannot recommend Rhubarb highly enough. This is a must -visit culinary stop in Singapore
5
Oh what a feast. This restaurant only has a few tables so it is imperative to book. They offer a degustation menu with paired wines or Ala Carte. The staff is French and very knowledgable about both the food and the wines. The food is prepared with very fresh ingredients and beautifully presented. Each item is accompanied by a full description by the waiter, of the dish and the wine being served
4
We found the place to be good with friendly staff. The ambiance was good with nice seating arrangement, Also, the food was excellent. Overall the experience at this rhubarb was fulfilling and worth every penny. All in all i would recommend this place for some good food and amazing management
5
All the dishes were very palatable and pleasing to the eyes; all done with lots of precision and care. One pleasurable observation on my food; few pleasant surprise find on ingredient and flavor at the bottom of some dishes. Is like a "treasure hunt", made me curious to finish all my food!Chef and staffs are always busy, but they made efforts to make you feel very at home. Thanks guys.This place is value for money for a Michelin star restaurant, and they only have 8 small tables (i.e. every last minute cancellation by guest will cost them on average a 13% loss in revenue. To be fair to Rhubarb, I suggest they have some form of confirmation deposit
5
Really wonderful service and food.
Thought Singapore fine dining could only ever achieve the best international heights of pricing, but this is truly top tier quality. Every dish takes you on a journey of discovery, truly divine.
5
Fantastic little restaurant,we decided on the set menu,exceptional food a wine list to match excellent staff.
4
Although the food was good, the prices are very high. Service was OK. Can find better value elsewhere.
5
good food off the ala carte menu, staff were friendly and prompt, nice ambience, would definitely come back again
5
It is only a small restaurant, with only 7 tables on the night we were there. The food though is innovative and presented well. Extensive wine list, and the maitre de was only too willing to assist in recommendations to match the food selection. It is a special occasion restaurant, as it is not a cheap eat, but worth the money

I had expected to be wowed, but although I had a largely pleasant meal here, at no stage did I have that feeling you get when you put something in your mouth and it delights, surprises and amazes you.The chef relies on luxury ingredients---caviar, truffle, foie gras, king crab, toothfish. And yet he then detracts from them by combining them with a myriad of other flavours. Whilst the dishes are technically expert, with numerous displays of superb technique, they could be, I think, better if they were simpler and allowed the ingredients to shine. This is of course just my opinion, and others obviously disagree.Textures all very similar, and most dishes lacked a crunchy element. There is a big use of gels and foams, which whilst I now appreciate, a few years ago would have disagreed with my palate.With regard to the individual dishes presented on the tasting menu….I believe the menu had just changed prior to my visit (and the price had risen), so I will describe them a little as they won't have been described before...skip if you want the surprise. First dish was shredded crab, with both a dice and a granita of watermelon, and caviar. It was fresh and playful, although not amazing. Again, the amazing flavour of the crab was overshadowed by the other flavours.The emulsion of pumpkin seemed to be an aerated pumpkin soup, although it was delivered with an explanation that it was definitely not a soup. The texture was interesting, but the flavour underwhelming, despite the truffle puree on the bottom of the soup.My foie gras was perhaps a bit undercooked, wobbly and oozy, bordering on unpleasant, and it was paired with both shaved horseradish and a bergamot gel, making for a puckeringly bitter course that was my least favourite. I almost didn’t finish it.I chose the toothfish for main, which was well presented and interesting, although the fish itself was a bit flavourless. The accompanying baby squid were delicious, and the pea puree light and fresh.I’m not a fan of sweetness, but dessert was clearly the winner, with amazing zingy flavours of raspberry in a number of different textures, and a spectacular sorbet which reminded me of cheesecake.Service is claimed to be relaxed and friendly...I found it more formal than that, but not at all snooty or patronizing, as it can be in some high end places. It was certainly attentive and polished, and dishes were explained reasonably well, including a few which came with suggestions on how to eat to best appreciate. I had read that one of the features of the restaurant was that the chef personally speaks with each table, giving it an intimate feel, however he did not make conversation with any table as far as I could see, although delivered the occasional meal. Wine was very expensive---$18 to $28 a glass, and $118 for wine pairing (presumably five glasses). And whilst I no longer have the bill with me, I believe I was charged around $18 for a bottle of sparkling water…my understanding is that alcohol is taxed very heavily in Singapore, but surely the same is not true for water.Overall however, value for money was pretty good...I understand Singapore is expensive and I've been to similar feeling restaurants elsewhere in the world that charge a lot more. I just wish there had been one or two things that exceeded expectations.

PLEASE VISIT MY WEBSITE FOR FULL REVIEW AND PICTURES AS WELL AS REVIEWS OF OTHER TOP RESTAURANTS AROUND THE WORLDOverall rating: 7.5/10I’m usually a bit skeptical of restaurants that are praised on Tripadvisor, as many ordinary cafes and places that are not even proper restaurants make it to top 10 in a given city. But I was glad that I decided to check out the menu at Rhubarb and afterwards go there (I booked the same day) simply based on finding it on Tripadvisor. The restaurant has one Michelin star, which in my opinion is deserved.I chose the tasting menu, and those courses were also available a la carte. I also managed to swap one course for another, so that was very nice of the restaurant. The price of the menu was SG$138 (€92). At the time of writing, April 2017, this has gone up to SG$148. I also had a glass of white wine priced at $22 (€14.70). 10 % service charge and 7 % GST (tax) was added to the bill, which seems to be common procedure in Singapore. This meant the bill came to SG$188.32 (€125.75) in total for one person.Before the actual menu began I had a small amuse bouche, which was pleasant but not extraordinary – which it didn’t need to be either:The first proper course was raw trout marinated in rhubarb served with fish roe, ricotta, apples, burnt bergamot and rhubarb puree with rose water. Again, pleasant but not spectacular (6/10):This was followed by the highlight of the meal, which was actually a simple creamy onion soup with a bit of basil oil on top and truffles at the bottom. I can’t say if the truffles were infused with truffle oil, but it was a lovely dish in any case. The truffles were a bit salty, but this only added to the dish. I had a very nice onion soup in Azurmendi in Spain, but this was even better. When I was in Rhubarb I thought this was at least 8/10, but this dish has lived on in my memory, here four months later, so I will give it 9/10:The next dish was the dish that I managed to get instead of a foie gras dish: Scallops with Mediterranean spices, pork belly, chicken skin, pork jus, and a puree of mostly cauliflower and white chocolate. The chocolate didn’t come through that much, but it was otherwise a very nice dish. As mentioned in my review of Le Cafe de Joel Robuchon in Hong Kong, where I went the day before, the pork here in Rhubarb was much better than in Le Cafe, although the pork here at Rhubarb didn’t quite match the very best ones I’ve had (e.g. in Gordon Ramsay Steak in Las Vegas, or Osteria Francescana in Italy). 8/10:The main course was Australian Wagyu beef, baby spinach, roasted garlic puree, king oyster mushroom puree with garlic, potato rilette with mushrooms, a shallot, a raddichio leaf, a pea shoot and a beef jus. I liked everything on the plate here, and it could just as well have been Gordon Ramsay, but it was a very rich dish and it needed something refreshing and/or acidic. Instead of the mushroom puree I would have added a pea puree and maybe a lighter sauce. Beef can go surprisingly well with white sauces. I asked for the beef to be medium rare, but I would call this rare, but maybe that’s just me. I often find that fancy restaurants cook the meat less than requested. Overall 7/10:The dessert was rhubarb marinated in rose water, a lovely refreshing fromage blanc sorbet, which is one of the most perfectly egg shaped sorbets/ice creams I’ve ever had, custard, strawberry puree with mint, pistachios, popping candy and meringue. Again, I liked everything here, except for one thing, which was an unfortunate combination for my palate: the rhubarb marinated in rose water. I can only tolerate rose water in tiny amounts, as it very easily tastes like soap for me (I had more than enough of it in Iran, where they love it). Rhubarb is actually something I enjoy immensely, but here it was completely overpowered by the rose water, and I couldn’t taste the rhubarb at all. What a pity! I would have preferred that no rose water had been used at all. Then I would probably have scored this dish 8/10, but now I’ll give it 7/10.Petit fours were a lychee jelly with shredded coconut, an overbaked, burnt even, madeleine-like cake, and a chocolate truffle (no flavours added). The madeleine was, obviously, the worst of the bunch, but the others were not exactly spectacular either, the jelly probably being the best. The chocolate truffle ought to have been scented with something in my opinion, although it had very good texture. Overall 6/10.So, as you can tell, this meal had its ups and downs, but mostly staying in good territory, with one dish soaring clearly above the rest.I also enjoyed the style of cooking, which I would call solid classic with a slight modern touch. Honestly, I’m getting a bit tired of the hyper creative “look at our modern take on our native dishes and ingredients that everybody used to hate 10-15 years ago”, so this meal was a refreshing break from that. Add to this lovely presentation.As for the service, the French waiter, who appeared to be the main waiter, was a great waiter, and we also had a small chat at the end. He was a great asset to a place like this, and he makes you forget all the stories you hear about snooty French people :-). I didn’t like the Asian waitress though. I had asked the guy if I could take pictures of the food, but after I took the first picture, the waitress came up to me and said brusquely: “We allow pictures, but not with flash!”. This is why only one picture looks decent. After I had finished one of the courses, I picked up my plate and handed it to her as she was approaching. I have done this many places, and usually the waiters respond with a big smile and a “thank you”. The waitress here sneered “I can take it myself!”.This kind of attitude was hardly the end of the world, but the waiter and the waitress were really worlds apart.Although I didn’t speak to him, the chef came out to the door at end as well and held it for me as I was leaving.If I come back to Singapore one day I would be happy to revisit Rhubarb

What a great little find! Amazing Chefs Menu and paired wines were out of this world. Ellie gave amazing referrals for other great local restaurants. Must book (only 7 tables) but so worth it. The service and food were some of the best I have had with awesome presentation

SuperbThe most delicious food we have eaten anywhere in the world.Cannot praise this restaurant highly enough. Ambience is calm and comfortable, plenty of space between tables, carpeted floors and beautiful simple elegant decorService was exemplary. Waitress knowledgable, friendly, polite but not intrusive.We had the wine pairing menu and found the charming Sommeliers recommendations perfectly complemented the menu and were delicious.Non pretentious excellenceHighly recommende

A spectacular and reasonably priced lunch at Rhubarb le Restaurant. A french styled Michelin starred restaurant in the centre of Chinatown, Singapore. We did get an amuse bouche and petit fours too and plenty of freshly baked bread.Unlike the two other starred restaurants we ate in on this trip, this one was what I'd consider to be a proper Michelin star - extra courses, nice bread, well cooked and presented food and the chef talking to you.The food was superb and wine not too dear.I don't actually have a bad word to say about it as all the ingredients worked well together and were clearly well thought out.Have a look at the pictures to see the type of food served and they will describe it better than I can in words - just come here and at least try the set lunch at a really good pric

We have been here before and love this food. It is really worth flying from Bangkok to eat here. Thank you Paul for making this great food. A big thanks to Ellie for great service with a great sense of humor. We will come back

I've tried a lot of French fine dining places in Singapore. I had seen on TripAdvisor that Le Rhubarb was ranked #5 and so decided to go with my boyfriend.The atmosphere is very nice, pure almost minimalistic, Japanese style. The service is really good, Jerome and Francis did a great job at serving us and providing advice on the wine (which was really good too).The food was excellent. For starters, we had the beetroot and stared foie gras. I have to say I couldn't help to think about the Beetroot dish at Odette, another amazing place in Singapore. Although the presentation was beautiful and it tasted really good, it didn't surprise as much as Odette's beetroot. The steared foie gras was really good as well but I think the Emulsion would have been a better choice. Next time !Now, where I think this restaurant excels are the main. We had the iberico pork cooked 2 ways and the pigeon. The pork was the best pork I had so far and the mousseline puree that goes with it was exquisite. I am not a big fan of pigeon but it tasted excellent as well. I would go as far as to say the mains here surpass Odette's tasting menu mains. Great job !And then dessert. When it comes to dessert I am the picky one. I usually get chocolate but this time decided to go with the Rhubarb dessert. And what a surprise ! The candies, the rhubarb, the ice cream ...everything about the dessert was perfect and I would happily had another one, had I not been stuffed. My boyfriend ordered the cheese plate and it was really fine as well.Overall, the experience was terrific and I am really looking forward to go back again and taste chef Paul's magnificent cuisine again. Thank you
5
This is one of our favourite restaurants. The food is amongst the best I have ever had. Having been quite a number of times, and tried many different dishes, I have yet to have one that is not exceptional . Jerome and the team deliver warm service that set's it apart from many restaurants with great food. You really feel at home and want to go back again, and again. Make sure to book it is very popular
5
As others have said there are limited covers, approx 20. We visited mid week and the restaurant was almost full. The food is really really good. Tastes are superb. Service excellent. A great night. Not inexpensive. Our 3 course meal for 2 with tip was around 500 SGD. But worth it
5
The most perfect setting for a romantic valentines meal. My partner can be a bit resistant on the “marketing machine” of special days, however when he launches himself into the sensational food at Rhubarb, he mysteriously ends up being quite content and happy to be celebrating - just as you want him to be! This is our second dining at Rhubarb, and new dishes with new flavours just hits the palate in surprising ways. It is a very small intimate affair, with only 6 tables, diners make a night of it, so it feels something special. If your partner appreciates sensational food, then the Rhubarb experience, with good service, lovely calm atmosphere makes for a very relaxing evening / haven for any day of the week - especially after a somewhat busy day-to-day shuffle of Singapore life

Owned and run by a conscientious and very capable Englishman - this place has lots of good things to offer.We had the set menu for the evening for 4 people - on a Tues night - it was a handful of tables in a very intimate setting (about a dozen tables). Food was superb. There were ingredients I don't normally like but I appreciate that it is very well done. I don't like sweet flavours in starters and mains, but he made it work well and I actually liked what he produced. Beautifully presented as well.Another recommendable place in Sing. On the higher end, so depending on the wine, can be about $S400 a person.
5
As it was for a special occasion we decided to go for the 5-course set menu and it was superb. Special mention for the foie gras and the venison, very nicely prepared and accommodated. Based on advice we had the meal washed down with a Saint-Joseph an excellent Côte-Rôtie, reasonably priced for the quality it offered. Service was professional yet friendly. Definitely highly recommended
5
First time here ( just passing through for 3 nights) both myself and partner had seared fois gras to start then we had mains of Pigeon and John Dory, all food was superbly cooked with some lovely flavour combinations. A nice touch was chef coming out to serve the starters and adding a grating of horseradish, also coming front of house to thank people as they were leaving.All of the staff were superb, a most enjoyable evenin
5
We had a reservation for six on a Saturday (last) night, we arrived just after 8:30pm and started with a half bottle of pinot noir. I can only say that the evening got better progressively. The foie gras was the best I have had, the fish was normal (have definitely had better Dory - maybe they should look into what fish they want to use). The beef, which everyone else on the table had, was the winner!They have this oyster leaf preparation which isn't for the faint of heart!For dessert, we tried pretty much everything on the menu and it was all above average. When i compare this to Jaan, the portions are a lot better and the quality is definitely more competitive. So if view isn't your top priority (and food is), I'd highly recommend Rhubarb. 3 hours well spent & the total damage was around $1,200 for six
5
We traveled from Bangkok specially to have dinner here (for the second time) and it was just as good as the first.We both went with the full set including wine pairing. Great dishes created by chef Paul main highlights from the set was pan seared foie gras with seared Sturgeon and pumpkin emulsion. (First visit was onion, that was also super but I think pumpkin was even better) but all dishes were faultless.Ellie the server has a dry and refreshing sense of humor paired with efficient and informative service, she's great.Great wines paired with the food too!Very small comment, when the kitchen is in full swing the escaping "aromas" can be a bit heavy when sitting at the chef's table. I don't mind this, but maybe others might not like it if they don't want their silk Chanel scarfs to smell like gourmet heaven

Love the atmosphere when I first walked into the restaurant. Had read many great reviews about the place and was excited about the visit. However, the experience was a great disappointment due to the bad service of a young waiter. the waiter's attitude was indescribably bad. I will not revisit or recommend the place no matter how good the food is
3
This is a nice small restaurant, and we had high expectations, not just for the food but also the service. The food is of a high quality for sure, but the service oh man!! My Wife was chastised by the waiter for wanting to try a little bit of bread because she had said she had a wheat allergy, surely it's up to her to manage the risk? I would love to try the food again, but because of the service, I wouldn't bother. So why still 3 points? because I believe YOU can go and have a excellent experience, for me I cannot

We were recommended to Rhubarb by our Melbourne travel agent for a significant (the big 70) birthday and were not disappointed.We were first in at around 6.30 so had the opportunity to sense the vibe of the place as we started our meal. Its a great vibe, from both the open kitchen and the attentive front of house staff, and through the night were were visited by both the maitre d' and the executive chef. I guess that's one of the benefits of having only 7 tables!The degustation was perfect, with serving sizes and timing service to the highest standard.Our waiter, herself a chef, was extremely knowledgeable, and kept us up to date as each course arrived, including the additional "free" ones in between, as my wife likes to say.And to top it off, when we reached dessert, out came the plate with a birthday greeting on the plate (in French of course).This was a night that delivered on expectations
5
Some of the best service we've enjoyed in SG. Personable and genuine. Fine dining but not fussy or stuffy. Very reasonable wine list in terms of value and pricing. 3 Course lunch menu a steal at $40. Coravin option for vintage wine a really nice perk. Top choice for delivering on high expectations
5
We organised a taxi to Rhubard Le Restaurant near Chinatown. We had read about it on TripAdvisor and we had booked a seat when we arrived in Singapore as they only have 7 tables. Tiny French restaurant with French wait staff â€“ felt like we very in Paris! We selected the 3 course lunch menu and were not disappointed. Excellent value at S$42 (plus taxes). My husband had the Emulsion du Marche, followed by Canadian port tenderloin, cotechino and pine barley and caramelised pineapple, coconut pulp, nana de coco with fromage blanc sorbet for dessert. I had heirloom tomatoes, ricotta, burnt pomelo with Yunupingu pearl to start, followed by lamb leg & tongue, potato galette and pea pulp and chocolate brownie, salted caramel, peanut praline and vanilla ice cream to finish. Yum, Yum
5
We we so fortunate to choose such a welcoming and warm restaurant during our trip to Singapore. We chose the 5 course tasting menu and it was a joy from start to finish. Chef Paul even took the time to come, serve and explain some of his creations, he called his skill craft not art - if that is the case his Butternut Pumkin Emulsion was pure craft - absolutely delicious and something I would have never thought of ordering. Everything else was so well thought of as well and we cleaned every plate! Front of house and chefs were so engaging and we can easily see why Rhubard rates so highly. A diamond in the sea of gems that is Singapore. Thank you from Geoff and Tris

We celebrated my birthday here in December 2016. What a lovely dinner! We had the tasting menu, which was delicious, and the open concept kitchen allowed you to see the chef creating the fantastic food. We had a lovely bottle of Chablis with our dinner too. The service was great, they really made an effort to engage with us and chat with us (unobtrusively, of course), and we had a great evening
5
Simply marvelous French restaurant, all at the highest level, kitchen, maintenance, interior, pleasant surprise was that the restaurant so-called open kitchen- when you have the opportunity to watch how you cook. a huge selection of wines to suit all tastes and budgets, all just 5 stars
5
This was a birthday treat. It's a real gem - intimate with only 6 tables. Eye watering delicious food; looked sensational and taste matched expectations. The best rhubarb dessert - that you were tempted to lick the plate - obviously I didn't. To compliment the food, was the excellent and attentive service. Whether visiting or living in Singapore - would highly recommend getting yourself along to this restaurant and make an advance booking.We are returning for our next special night out
4
I had the tasting menu paired with wine - 5 courses, 5 different wines and all of them were excellent except perhaps the main course (I had the Beef) - which was good but more on the average side rather than exceptional. The wines were really well paired with the food, particularly the Chardonnay with the white onion emulsion with truffle - divine. I would recommend the restaurant for the food but I would hesitate to return there unless the menu had changed. Another small criticism which is my personal taste and view was the interior decor. The table cloth on the table directly opposite me was significantly lob-sodded and this irritated the OCD in me! I found the under-skirts on the tables old-fashioned and not in line with the (what I presume to be) more minimalist attempt at interior decor. A change of table design and perhaps a little cancel on each table could help
4
We liked it all, with a little exception on the starter: the foie gras in Terrine was too solid and maybe too sweet, but the dish was good anyway.
The pigeon and the beaf wagyu were super! 😃
5
Tried for my husband's birthday. Great meal, good service. Definitely recommend for a special occassion.
5
An excellent meal in this restaurant. We had the Chef's menu and it was superb. Everything was elegantly presented, flavours were well-balanced. Love the desserts and the petit fours. Service was polished as well. A worthy Michelin star.
5
Rhubarb is an intimate french restaurant in the Chinatown district of Singapore. The restaurant only has 7 tables. We weren't sure how they survive with so few covers per day, but we were glad they do as the creative, quality food is well worth the visit. The staff and sommelier were helpful & it was nice to meet the chef. A nice concept - glad to see them rewarded with a michelin star
5
We had a lovely familydinner at Rhubarb last evening in Singapore. What a journey on a plate❣We choose our dishes from the ala carte so that everyone could have something they really liked. All the dishes looked so beautiful and tasted amazing - the kitchen is so innovative! The restaurant has only seven tables so the reservation beforehand is a must. But it really is a worth it!
3
I was invited by a dear friend for her Birthday Lunch. It was just three of us excited to try this Michelin Star restaurant in Singapore.It was an intimate place with only around 7 or 8 tables and was full when we were there. The food selection in the menu all sounds wonderful and we felt like we needed advice what to order. And this is when the confusion began.... The waitress - the only one - was not helpful at all, her answers to our questions were..."everything in our menu is good otherwise we don't put it there"... OR ..."I can't tell you what is better, I don't want to force you to choose" - as if we will let her to force us to chose. We just wanted some advice. We ended up ordering the Set Lunch Menu.And I wonder if to get the accreditation for Michelin Star Restaurant, service does not matter.The only time the waitress smiled to us was when she needed to apologise to have mixed up our orders:-) - which I genuinely thought was not supposed to ever happen in a Michelin Star place?Food was good but not excellent, I have had better French cuisine at non Michelin one, and with a friendlier service.This will be the one time and only I visit this place
4
This place is not only amazing in terms of food quality, service, intimacy and edginess of serving ingredients but also incredible value. Highly recommend for a romantic night or business lunch. Only 7 tables means you get great service and the food is out of the this world. Highly recommended
5
I must say I have been pretty skeptical with regards to Michelin starred restaurants in Singapore as a few of them (Cut, Crystal Jade) have thoroughly failed to impress. But this establishment not only impressed, but raised the bar as to what to expect from a gastronomical point of view.I must say the synergy of ingredients in every dish was top notch. Some of the dishes that will and continue to leave a lasting impression include the foie gras, crab terrine, and wagyu in their creativity and of course savouriness. These have set the bar as to what French cuisine can achieve in singapore. I personally believe this establishment should be in contention for 2 stars if they continue to impress. Service is top notch as well.Definitely well deserved to be at the top of the tripadvisor ranking, unlike others (Fratini). do visit

We ate at Rhubarb for a work dinner. I had not heard about it until it won a Michelin Star. I was comforted to know that it was owned by people connected with Au Petit Salut which is a well regarded restaurant in Singapore. The restaurant is small and relatively quiet in one of my favorite parts of town. It has an open kitchen. Parking is available in the public car park across the road. The restaurant decor isn't over the top. The food was very good and service efficient. We had the a la carte. The prices are not over the top as is the case with some of the two star places in town. A good wine list - mainly from Burgundy and the a Rhone.I will be back to try the tasting menu
5
In my 14 years in Singapore I hardly had that excellent food like in Rhubarb last week. I almost forgot how great food can be. Every single dish is of utmost excellence in taste, composition, preparation and presentation. Unbelievably refined and delicate. Rhubarb is the real discovery of the year. Who ever wants real great French food in Singapore must pay them a visit and take the course menue, as this will take you on a fantastic journey through the universe of real French kitchen. Not it only the food is second to none, so is the service. Attentive, personal, with style, excellence and knowledge. Rhubarb is the real fine dine experience
4
The ambience was great. Each dish presented were explained patiently. Love the breads. Request for birthday wishes for my boyfriend was fulfilled. Thanks a lot!
4
Went for a romantic dinner.
Food is great made with fine ingredients and creativity. Service is very good. But we felt atmosphere was too cold in the dining area which explains 4 rating vs. 5.
5
My husband and I had the surprise menu, and were scintillated and enthralled by every course.. I didnt make notes on the dishes but everything was fantastic, and the service was top notch with delicous wine choices.
5
I had a very enjoyable lunch there. Innovative food (we went for the lunch menu). Excellent service and an acceptable wine list.
5
Was here last week with my friends and was blown away.I'm a real foodie and can rarely be 100% satisfied by a single dining experience, however this place ticks all the boxes and everything was great.The restaurant is small with only 7 tables, but for me that's ideal because each guest had their dish prepared with meticulous attention from the British chef. He and his small team have a level of concentration that can only be matched by their obvious passion. Even our young lady server used to work in the kitchen! The two gentleman running the service make everyone feel welcome, relaxed and well informed of what is offered. The chef also makes a point of touching every table and serve at least on of his dishes to each guest. This is great as one might be lucky enough (as we were) to pick his brains of the wonderful menu he created. Foie Grass with horseradish and seared sturgeon is just one amazing dish, of many that we had here.Oh, did I mention the 40 year old calvados? ...amazing!
5
I had the chef surprise lunch menu. The combination of flavors and textures was clever. For starters, the salmon was paired with pomelo, while the cream broth hid a treasure trove of truffles. For mains, the beef was executed very well, and served with an airy mash which covered the melt-in-your mouth beef cheeks. As for desserts, the combination of flavors, textures and colors were arresting to say the least. Surprised, impressed and extremely happy to have come here for a meal
5
Had a client lunch here and we had the Chef Surprise Menu. Everything that they placed in front of us was amazingly tasty! The service was attentive and engaging - they made good recommendations on the wine, and ensured my guests were well taken care of! Which simply left me to socialize a little, enjoy my food and get down to business without a worry. Even the chef came out to introduce the dishes, which made us feel special! Happy clients, happy me!It's a cozy place with a few tables, so this would be great for a romantic night out too. The parking around the area can be a little nightmarish.Totally would come back again
5
We were there for a birthday celebration. Liked the limited seating which provided an exclusive, quiet and cosy ambience. We had the tasting menu which was simply delicious and turned out to be very filling. Perhaps one downside was it was hard to make out what the serving crew were saying when they were introducing the menu and each dish that was served (yes, there were more than one waiter but each did not speak English clearly enough. There were 3 of us and we all speak good English). Nonetheless, the meal was enjoyable
5
We had the great set menu with 2 excellent dishes and good combinations for the other dishes. Good wine list at reasonable price for a 1 star restaurant in SingaporeService was the best I have experienced so far in SingaporeSo a very good place for an intimate diner, with a small room that accommodates only a few tables and a view on the opened kitchen.The restaurant decor is maybe a little too "cold"The only thing I believe is not relevant for a 1 Michelin star restaurant is the toilets (no kidding, they should definitely do something to upgrade them
5
Been there for lunch during October 2016, we chose the surprise menu offering 2 starters 1 main and 1 desert for a very fair price, the food was nothing but amazing, each dish was a new surprise and overall one of the best restaurant visits i ever had, in total with 2 glasses of wine the cost was ~180 USD for 2 persons, very reasonable and fair for a Michelin star plac
4
Went there recently after they have been starred. we enjoyed the variety of food but feel that the price was a little steep. nonetheless a really good restaurant
5
This is a small but cosy French restaurant in Duxton Hill where amid the numerous restaurants in that area, managed to hold its fort and excel perfectly.Due to its small size of only 7 tables in the ground level, the restaurant manages to win over their customers with their touch of personal service. Wine list is extensive and they have a variety of different types of half bottles, great for guys who need to drive but with partners not into wine.Ordered the Le Menu which comes with a great blend of different textures and tastes. Of special mention is the trout appetizer and the waygu main.Desert is more ordinary but coupled with their namesake rhubarb in the desert makes a wonderful closure to the meal.Tea was served at the end of the sumptuous meal with a petit four. However in our case, only three was served. Nonetheless a great meal in a nice raining evening. This is great place to have a nice dinner chatting with your partners or close friends

I had a birthday dibber at Rhubarb, having read a number of positive reviews and wasn't disappointed. I asked for the courses to be spread our over the course of the evening and they duly obliged with very efficient but unobtrusive service and an excellent and very knowledgeable sommelier. Food was good and presented beautifully. The trout was delicious with the pomelo and apple cutting through the richness of the trout and ricotta. The emulsion was also a triumph with the surprise of the truffle puree at the bottom. I am not a huge fan of foie gras so offer no comment on this dish other than it looked very good. I opted for the Pork Belly and Scallop dish and whilst the individual components were very good, I felt that the dish lacked something to cut through the richness. In truth, I was a little disappointed by the Rhubarb dessert which wasn't really to my taste although it looked fantastic and with hindsight should have opted for the cheese. We had a very agreeable glass of champagne as an aperitif and an excellent bottle of Sancerre to accompany the meal. A little pricey but I would have no hesitation recommending the food or visiting again.
5
We heard about Rhubarb when they got a Michelin star and wen there for a special celebration. We took the tasting menu and were superbly surprised: yummy food, various textures, loads of techniques used from foam to gels and pickles. Additionally the plates are super colourful and flavor associations delicious and unusual. The staff is attentive, very pro and friendly. The chef is unpretentious and passionate. Fantastic experience, highly recommended!
5
I've been to Rhubarb three times now, and I have never been disappointed by the quality of the food and the excellence of the service. The atmosphere is simple, elegant, ideal for a couple night out. And if you consider the quality, taste and originality of the food, it is actually good value for money. Few restaurants in Singapore offer this level of quality and service at this price. I absolutely reocmmend it
5
Excellent food. The prawn carpaccio was wrapped in cucumber and gelatine is so fresh. The emulsion had many flavours and rich in diversity of flavours. The Veal was classical. The pigeon as well. Rhubarb pudding had a modern twist. Lovely service. Nice place. Highly recommended ms
5
The level of food and service quality always leave me in awe. They have recently updated their wine list and changed the food menu and it is really interesting, time to revisit if you haven't been here in 'Autumn'. The prawn tartare dish's combination, divine. The seared foie gras with hazelnut praline, fresh hazelnut and mirabelle plum for me is a total killer. The sweetbread along with the veal three ways i had, splendid! I can never get enough of the food here, each time elevating in standards. The wines they have here carefully chosen and they have wines served on Coravin now! So exciting!I am always looking forward to my visits here
4
Lovely location and quaint dining room, well spaced and comfortable. Had the chefs suggestions, the stand out was the pigeon, beautifully cooked and balanced flavours on the palate. One has to mention the Foie Gras :))Wine list is well thought out and the service courteous and professional.Recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy culinary art that satisfies the palate and stomach, amongst friends. It brings together camaraderie and the enjoyment of fine dining
3
It is a tiny French restaurant, and requires a booking. We were two of us who went for lunch, and both of us ordered the 3 course set lunch. As I do not eat a dessert, I asked for other options and were offered coffee. It was disappointing that coffee is not included in the set meal. Our starter or Entre was delicious, but our main course was a bit disappointing. However, my cheese platter was really nothing to write home about. The service was slow, too much gap between each course, so overall it was an ok meal
2
went there for a dinner with a couple of friends mid of this year. the food was really good apart from the dessert which i didn't fancy as i'm not a fan of rhubarb (sorry!) but when the bill came, we were shocked. the service staff then, was a little impatient while we were analysing the bill which made us a little anxious and uncomfortable. paying almost $300 per pax for a bottle of wine shared and a meal to us were too steep. nonetheless good food but be prepared for the price :
3
Lovely dinner with my wife, good atmosphere and courteous service. Food was perfect, delicious, and extremely high standard of cuisine.
5
Taken to Rhubarb for my 60th birthday by my son and daughter in law. Food was out of this world. They had visited before and chosen the tasting menu. We went for three courses. Visually extravagantly amazing, the tastes were something else. A real treat and a change from the mundane menus elsewhere. The staff are courteous and explain each course intricately and are obviously proud of their achievements especially now they have a Michelin star. Well done
5
I loved the fact that the restaurant only had eight tables, it meant conversation could happen without having to raise ones voice as they are very well spaced out. We ordered from the a la carte menu, which had a nicely considered selection to choose from, and we asked the waiter to choose a wine for us, based on our requirements. He acquitted himself very well. The presentation of the food is excellent, and each dish we ordered exceeded expectations.I highly recommend Rhubarb
5
We were looking for a nice gourmet dining experienceGot lucky to get a table due to a last minute cancellationOverall very nice food, great advise by the sommelier. Recommend gevrey chanbertin les jeunes rois for an absolute amazing experience.Fantastic value for money A place that should not be misse
5
A really pleasant experience. In this tiny restaurant the kitchen is almost as big as the dining area. Modern setting. Only 2 serving staff. A very simple menus with probably five choices for each course. The food presentation is Michelin standard without some of the arrogance. Outstanding service and some of the best value, quality wines in Singapore. I am going again in 10 days time. Parking next door provided you get an early start.
5
The Rhubarb restaurant is certainly very popular. I had planned to go there several times but had not booked far enough in advance to secure a table. The restaurant is on Duxton Hill, a collection of small, high end restaurants and bars populate the same street.The food, wine and service were all excellent. Myself and my dining companion had little experience with French wines and were given excellent advice by the waiter. The food presentation and taste is high end French style and very good to excellent in my opinion. Well worth a visit
4
Located at 3 Duxton hill. There is an open space public car park in front of the restaurant. However, due to the many eateries in the area, there is just insufficient lots. Go around b4 6pm to get a lot. We had a birthday celebration there. Place very cozy, only 7-8 tables. The evening we were there, all tables were mainly occupied by couples. Despite telling them that it was for birthday celebration during booking, no special was done, not even a slice of cake. Guess probably wants a quiet environment. The presentation of food was excellent. The same however cannot say of its taste. It is definitely one click below its presentation. Price wise is quite expensive too. We spent an average of $130 per pax for a starter, mains n dessert from the ala carte menu.
3
We have been there for a lunch with my wife and were disappointed! The food was ok (special mention for the onion soup) but the rest wasn't exceptional for us. The service a bit below classy restaurants but nice anyway. Will I go there again? maybe not but didn't have a bad time either
5
A creative addition to the Duxton Hill scene is worthy of a mention. Their creative treatment of French cuisine is impressive. The produce is fresh, the flavours are rich and layered. An impressive wine list also covering the many regions within France and, some, from abroad. The waitstaff are warm, welcoming and knowledgeable. A small venue, with an open kitchen, adds to the appeal. Definitely worth a try if you enjoy an open, yet intimate dining experience. Bookings essential
3
We were looking forward to our visit as we heard a lot about it. We went A La Carte and while the food was OK we did not find it to be on a par with the prices being charged. I had the pigeon and I must say it did not have the 'gamey' flavor I would expect. Also it was served with a sauce that was a bit tasteless and with very little else. Our friends had the Wagu and again the comment was 'good but not great'. Desserts were OK and the coffee and chocolate Moose was interesting but the signature Rhubarb dessert was a bit disappointing. Staff friendly but could have been better and when we ordered a bottle of red wine they never told us it was the last one of that type. Bill was what you would expect in a higher end restaurant but unfortunately the food was not there
5
My family come here on first time, the food so nice ,and good service, the price ok, i will come back again
5
outstanding food. its a small place and well deserves the star. try the pigeon which i would list as one of the best i've had in singapore. the rhubarb special desert was outstanding as well.
willl definitely visit again.
5
Amazing fine dining experience, most impressive gourmet and wine, with excellent French hospitality. Our family enjoyed such a fabulous dinner at Rhubarb, highly recommend this restaurant.
5
Our 2nd visit to this small 7-table restaurant. Delightful lunch, some of the best value in town. Our favourite dishes were: Beef tartare, lamb leg & tongue, Japanese mackerel, Selection of Farm cheese. Attentive service and nice surroundings. Better book in advance, with 1 well-deserved michelin star, Rhubard will be even more popular
5
It's very difficult to book this restaurant and I came to realization as they only host 7 tables each evening. I went with their Le Menu which is around 4 courses. They were impressive, refined and creative. The truffle soup was amazing and foie gras was great too.
4
My husband and I visited Rhubarb for the first time and were impressed with the professional service by the 2 French gentlemen there. They were efficient, polite and made me feel like I was well taken care on point! That made the difference for us as we eat out a lot and most Singapore restaurants have friendly but incompetent service. The chef also came out to serve some dishes and he was nice and his food was competent. A lot of smoked dishes though!
5
Well worth its one michelin star!It was a small restaurant offering no more than 7 dining tables, of which guests are well taken care of. We had the tasting menu where each dish was well presented with complementing flavours. Amuse bouche of hamachi cones was an eye opener! The Emulsion which consisted of smoked chestnut and mushroom with a rich layer of truffle puree was fantastic. So was the scallop with super tender pork belly that pointed at great cooking skills and well thought out food combinations. Service was warm and they had a nice french wine list for a heightened experience of food and wine pairing
4
We dine here in June before the 1 star was awarded to them. honestly, i didn't think this place would have won a star if i were to consider overall ambiance alongside the food. The restaurant has relatively simple decor and ordinary tableware. In a nutshell, the place lacks character. Onto food... I felt it was good value of money (price & quality) but the experience didn't WOW me as much as Jaan did... yet they both have 1 star. Sure, service was good and so was the food. would i crave for it and return? unlikely

Managed to get a reservation here a few days after the Michelin guide was released. Took the set menu and was very satisfied at the end of the meal. The Wagyu was one of the best I've ever had anywhere and the Rhubarb dessert was absolutely stunning
5
Chef Paul Longworth & Manager/Sommelier have a gem on their hands. Rhubarb Le Restaurant is like a well oiled machine, serving up exceptional French food. Their one Michelin star is well deserved as evidenced by a lunch I recently ate there. Leaving things to Chef Paul, I opted for the Chef's menu. Four courses plus an amuse bouche & petit fours with coffee, there wasn't a false step. I ate well with pate de foie gras, Jerusalem artichoke puree with truffle, quail done two ways and the chef's take on strawberries & cream for dessert. You can't do any better than to have lunch here. It's beautiful, indulgent & a wonderful way to treat yourself. Bravo & long lived success to you both.

A nice restaurant with excellent foods and cozy place. However, the service is a bit slow and the location is quite hard to reach.

Took our young sons for my wife's 50th and we were all made to feel very welcome. High quality French food. Loved the pigeon, but the scallop and pork belly was amazing. Best of either that I've had anywhere. Great French wine selection too.
5
Good but slightly snotty service. E.g. there bottles of still water cost like $10 or something similar.
Excellent food!
But a very expensive night, for three people we wound up paying around $600-$700 for dinner (with a bottle of wine)
5
One of few restaurants in singapore with a nice ambience and fine quality french food. Food is well thought through and our favorite is the pigeon and foie gras. Service was top notch and attentive and they have a great selection of wine from new world and old world
5
I was treated to dinner here by my fiancée. From the second we arrived we were made to feel at ease. Front of house was friendly, helpful and exceptionally knowledgeable. We opted for the taster menu, and every course was absolutely amazing......it was an experience I shall never forget........Thank you so much...!!!!

We've been to Rhubarb many times and it keeps producing stunning food. The set menu gives the palate a treat with the highlight this time being the newly added artichoke which was so light and fresh. Jerome runs the front of house and he has always recommended some fantastic wines which are tailored to our guests preferences. Rhubarb has just been given a Michelin star and its thoroughly deserved. Highly recommend trying their food.

Food was normal. Went with a few colleagues as it was the top restaurant in Singapore only to be disappointed at the food quality. Atmosphere was nice enough.Service was inconsistent, there were a number of times where we were ignored when we needed attention. Definitely thinking twice before coming back.
5
With more than 8,000 restaurants Singapore literally has something for everyone. We are gradually working our way around some of the better eateries and so far Rhubarb tops the lot! The food is outstanding. From start to finish. Highlights for me were the emulsion and the Wagyu. The wine list covers the bases well. I suggest you ignore all reviews that underscore based on price - this place is expensive - but you know that before you arrive and you have it confirmed when the bill arrives. There may be some better value for money options but we are yet to find anywhere with better food or service. Excellent.
5
First class service - the waiters were excellent and did everything perfectly. They were detailed and came back to us often enough. The food was simply orgasmic. I could not fault a single dish and every bite was YUM. I am so happy with our experience. Yes it is pricey, but it is a fine dining restaurant so you get what you pay for. We will always remember this night; thanks to Rhubarb
5
What an absolute gem of a find. Just outside of Chinatown sits this elegant restaurant that serves delicious high end culinary cuisine worth every cent that you pay. For me the highlights were the pigeon; the cod and the rhubarb dessert. I've never eaten pigeon before but if I was served pigeon of that quality every time I would gladly become a regular pigeon diner. The cod was amazingly tender and just fell apart. The rhubarb dessert was perfectly balanced and so I wasn't left feeling as though I needed to run 10k just to burn off the sugar. The restaurant is small but the decor and the ambience suit the style of the restaurant. The chef, the maître d and their staff deserve just as much praise for their professionalism and obvious people skills. I honestly cannot find any fault with my dining experience at Rhubarb. I wish then bonne chance. They certainly deserve to do well
5
I was there last weekend with my girlfriend and the place was lovely!
The food was a 4/5 and the ambience was awesome! I highly recommend this place with your loved ones.
4
Food was delicious ; it was likely a slow night as we were the only table with diners in the restaurant so it felt as if we booked up the whole place ! Chef was gracious and since it was my birthday dinner , he actually came out to personally extend to be birthday wishes . Rather pricey , so this'll be one of those " for special occasions only " type place 
5
My husband organised this as a special dinner for me. The food was amazing and the staff brilliant. I can bit quite fussy with my food and I don't usually like to try anything left field. I didn't get a choice here! I was eating things I would not ordinarily choose when dining out. Everything was delicious
5
I've tried the set lunch at Rhubarb a couple of times and have never been disappointed. With the service, ambience and the gorgeous food, this is definitely a place to impress a business partner or a nice lunch treat with a friend or two. Classic French favourites form the base of the dishes, and they are further enhanced by perfectly executed sauces and accompaniments. I normally wouldn’t ever select mushroom soup but at Rhubarb, the silky emulsion was a joy, indeed. Still remembering the hint of truffle and how the rich yet airy emulsion literally jiggled a little when they placed it in front me. For mains, I’ve tried the quail, duck and beef dishes before, and it’s a good thing they’ve all been good because the lunch menu changes, so no matter what’s available, I have a feeling it’s going to be good. Likewise for desserts, whether it's the cheese platter or a luscious chocolate dessert, they have been sweet endings to a lovely meal.Definitely worth a visit, especially over lunch which is at $42 per pax
5
I have to give it to them, top service, top atmosphere, top wine, top food! We had various main courses, i had the pigeon with rhubarb as main, something i usually try in star places, probably the best one i had so far. Congrats to the chef!
4
Little piece of France in the middle of Singapore. We found the food a little bit of "safe" and would need a bit more deepness. It was good though, but nothing special to reach the level of excellence. The greatest experience was the long and warm conversation with the owner sharing opinions about wines and cousines around the world. Food 3,5 ☆ and service 4,5☆
5
A wonderful evening with my daughter and son-in-law to celebrate my wife's birthday.The service was impeccable and the food was top quality. Thanks to the staff for explaining each dish and what to look out for in the different flavours. Wine was a bit pricey but that is Singapore
5
I've actually dined at Rhubarb several times and always having the degustation menu. This is the only restaurant that manages to fill be up before we we reach the main course. The portions are very generous. Not like most degustation menu. Definitely value for money and did I mention how delicious the food is? Service is excellent and they are very attentive and friendly . My son has gone back to Perth and he's still dreaming of his meals in Rhubard. They sure know how to pick their butter. I would also be very contented with the bread and butter served. I've been telling all my friends who loves good food to visit Rhubarb

Saw Rhubarb written up elsewhere and decided to try their fixed lunch. A very wise decision! This is a tiny place with only 7 tables, but unlike many small restaurants the chef Paul Longworth and Maitre d' Jerome DesFonds do not skimp on staff or service. With a kitchen staff of 5 visible in the open kitchen at the rear of this elegant space, and service by Paul, Jerome and a third waiter, every dish arrived in perfect order. In what other potential Michelin-starred (the first Singapore Michelin Guide comes out this year) does the chef himself deliver some of the dishes and instruct you as to how to eat them for the maximum gustatory pleasure? An amuse bouche of caviar in a small ice cream cone shell was to be eaten in one bite--for a burst of multiple flavors. The 3 course fixed lunch is 42 SGD--not cheap, but as a New York regular, typical for this high level cuisine in fine restaurants there. For a starter what was called an "emulsion" made with a cauliflower base was delivered by Chef Longworth with instructions to scoop it from the bottom of the bowl, not to sip. Truly delectable! The duck was done to perfection (medium rare) and accompanied by a potato napoleon that was itself an eyeopener. For dessert the fruit "soup" was actually beautifully fresh berries and fruits with vanilla iice cream that was bathed in a delicious fruit broth for another fascinating mixture of flavors and textures. Overall, a wonderful dining experience. Next time I am in Singapore, my partner and I will be back to sample more from the enticing a la carte menu
5
I knew from the moment we walked in and showed gracefully to our table we were going to have a wonderful experience. Our waiters knew the careful coddling of every last ingredient on the menu and their service impeccable helped by the comfortable surroundings the excellent drinks, the smells wafting from the open plan kitchen and the waiters make asking endless questions about cooking methods and gorgeous ingredients almost as much of a pleasure as eating them.There’s an expertise to Pauls cooking that renders the tastebuds excited as well as the belly sated, a balance other chefs could do with a bit more of. Food was exciting and tasty, lots or gorgeous twists and surprises, so go and enjoy you won't be disappointed - thank you for a great evening and see you all soon.
5
I have been to Singapore for 3D2N. Rhubarb is the best restaurant I tried these days. Thanks for having trip advisor so I visited the restaurant. I love the environment, service and of course the food!
5
Our second time here and the food is still exquisite and service impeccable. Portions are not huge but surprisingly, it fills you up. For the quality presented, price is reasonable (at least for lunch). Recommended.
5
I chose the $78 chefs menu for lunch to take me out of my comfort zone and away from my normal choices.. decided to keep myself nice with just one glass of pouilly fume. Bouche amuse . A smokey cone of delicious fish & roe2 STARTERSBeing a Vanilla cured himachi with scorched pomello, caviar & vanilla jelly. Delicious Followed by an Emulsion of Jerusalem artichoke with tiny peas & slithers asparagus Stunning!!MAIN COURSE Pigeon 2 ways. Confit leg, roast breast. Crackling skin, pressed potatoes, vanilla sweet potato puree and a cigarillo of pomegranite pearls. WOW!DESSERT Strawberries and cream :-well strawberry jelly, strawberry puree, caramelized strawberries, meringues, olive oil cake, pistachio crush and blanc sorbet. AMAZING Coffee and petit fours, Lychee jelly dusted in toasted coconut, macaron & chocolate drop. Chef bought dishes to table and explained all. A truly fantastic lunch. With great host. Definitely worth eating here. So far best food I have eaten in Singapore 
5
In our years in Singapore, we have tried lot of good fine dining restaurant but very few excellent: Rhubarb is definitely in that category.This is a tiny restaurant with very few table but with great service and great fine dining food.We tried the 5 courses menu and every dish was great. Each of the course comes with a little twist, something quite unusual but very well executed and delicious.In the fine dining category, just below the ultra high end restaurants - the likes of Andre or Jaan - this is definitely the best we tried in Singapore.Bravo to the chef
4
Another great meal. Love the service and atmosphere. Food is adventurous and, when it comes off (which it mainly does) spectacular! Great ingredients and a nice wine list. Good, honest fine dining in a city which otherwise has too many restaurants not making the grade in this respect.
5
From the moment I entered the restaurant everyone at Rhubarb was very friendly and welcoming. I had read many of the reviews and I was determined to try the food for myself.I decided to go for the Chef's special lunch menu and for the next hour I was treated to a culinary masterclass. I had the Chef's surprise menu:1. Emulsion - Jerusalem artichoke, peas, broad beans, verbena2. Tuna marinated in Rhubarb3. Pigeon breast & confit leg, rhubarb & rose puree, grapes ‘a la Aussignac’4. Strawberry Fromage blanc, jelly, pistachio, olive oil cake, nata de cocoEach dish was explained to me by the helpful staff and the chef even came over to explain one of his new dishes (tuna marinated in rhubarb). Every dish tasted as good as it looked and I left feeling very satisfied.What I liked about it the most - The food and the friendly atmosphere.What I liked about it the least - I wish they had a restaurant in Japan (where I live).Note: This is not really a restaurant for children. Leave them at home with a babysitter and enjoy the time with your loved one
5
One of the single most memorable nights in a long foodie career. Jerome who controls the front of house,and there are only seven tables so book ahead, ensures you have a memorable night assisting with the choosing of the wine; only French available so very very pricy. The degustation is the way to go and let the British chef paul take those taste buds to a whole new level. The ash marinated cod is to be remembered and whilst somewhat cliche this restaurant takes it to a whole new level. Thank you for an amazing night that rediscovers food as not simply just taste but as a sensory experience. We totally enjoyed having both the chef and Jerome visit our table and attend to us with such enthusiasm. Hugely expensive but worth it for the memories
5
A small intimate restaurant ( 7 tables ) serving a limited a la carte , with a menu ( SGD138 ) .It should be noted that the menu , is only served if everyone on the takes it .It is a culinary journey to exite the taste buds and is served by professionals , who are knowledgeableof the components and with what it should be paired .All in all an excellent an memorable dinner , expect to pay $500-600 with wine.
5
I was attracted to this restaurant by the high rating at Tripasdvisor. I was able to book a table for lunch and we tried the surprise menu.Overall, the dishes were good and interesting. The dessert could have been better. The price was not too excessive either.But is it the no 1 rated restaurany in Singapore? I would say there are other better restaurants.
5
Both food (4.5 stars) and service (5 stars) were very good. the pork (chef's lunch menu) was very well done. the extremely attentive (without at all being intrusive), friendly and helpful wait staff with a really good sense of humour nailed its 5 star rating. more creativity in dishes and sophistication in flavours would give this place 5 stars for food.
5
Fabulous service and food. Great attention to detail and very interesting combinations in each course.
5
Went for lunch at Rhubarb - ordered the set lunch. Every course was cooked to perfection! Great value for fine French food!
5
Great classic French food. Tried it twice - once for business and once for personal for lunch both times. The set lunch is great value.
5
Went for the set lunch and was very impressed, restaurant was busy so sat upstairs, despite that they kept track of us and we had great service, food was not cheap but as a set lunch amazing value, wine by the glass was also sensational.
4
A place for special events; with only seven tables, this French-cuisine restaurants feels like a private dining room - cozy, comfortable, elegant.The service was excellent with a perfect maitre de service and the chef serving and introducing the dishes. The food was excellent, refined and full of interesting, well-designed combinations.And it comes with a price tag... Each dollar well spent for a special event
5
Even 5 months after our dinner for two in Rhubarb we tell people how much we enjoyed this evening and that they should try it. It started with the surprise, how cosy this restaurant with its open kitchen is. Only 7 tables, dimmed music, excellent service by a knowledgeable waiter who was well aware what he is serving. I fell in love with the amuse bouche, a little charcoal icecream cone filled with crevettes and decorated with mousse au salmon and green dill. I don't even remember what exactly we had for dinner, but I know that I did not want to brush my theeth this evening, just to have a longer memory of this excellent dinne
4
Food was excellent French haute cuisine and service was also excellent. Heavy but delicious meal. We were seated downstairs. I did not see the upstairs but the downstairs was very minimally decorated. I assume this is a new-ish place which has dedicated resources to perfecting the food. Hopefully they will soon dress up the interior as well
3
We had a table for 6 for Saturday. There was only one waiter for several tables. This solo waiter was knowledgeable, helpful and courteous initially. However, it was difficult to get his attention when the restaurant became busy. One of our guests wanted milk for her coffee but could not get the waiter's attention. When she finally got his attention, he said, "you are not the only one waiting, there are others waiting as well". Sure, we understand its busy, but this is certainly not what we would like to hear when we pay for a $200 per person meal. On top of this, he also shushed my friend and me in the midst of our conversation in order to explain the dishes. This is not what a well trained waiter in a top ranked restaurant should do
4
Came here to celebrate friend's birthday. We tried Le Menu ($138) and it has Foie Gras, emulsion, cod, Rhubard dessert. For mains we had pigeon which was off menu. Had a bottle of champagne and CDP to accompany the dinner. The restaurant has 7 tables and filled up by 8:30pm. Good service and nice ambience.
5
My wife and I like to dine out at least one a month just the two of us without the kids. We generally like to try something new but are often disappointed.Thank you Rhubarb for an amazing meal and your wonderful staff.We decided "a la Carte" instead of the SGD 138 7 course meal but next time we will change.We ordered three starters. Foie gras with Crab, amazing! Scallops with pork, amazing and Hamachi excellent!Main courses followed with a Wagyu onglet for me and a Charcoal Cod for my wife. Both Amazing....I ordered a small cheese board and chocolate dessert for my wife, excellent.The staff were very good, attentive but not over powering. It's a small restaurant with an open kitchen so book in advance.The only drawback is that the chef is English.....but you cannot have everything!Just joking the Chef is English and came over and introduced some plates himself. I asked him if he would be able to make a fracasse of Snaliis for my daughter on our next visit and he graciously said yes.We will be back very very soon!Thank you Rhubard.....
5
I rarely write reviews but this place deserves every once of my time to say how awesome the food and service was....I have been to the best restaurants in London but this beats them. Try the pigeon! Incredible...and the strawberry desert had a great surprise
5
Really excellent menu - surprising, inventive, delicious - coupled with great selection of wines (even by the glass) and careful courteous service.
5
We had the chefs surprise menu and were blown away by the standard. All the dishes were perfectly balanced and presentation was first class. We were given great service and the wine suggestion was spot on.
4
There are only seven tables so the ambience is rather private.
The chef will serve the food. Service is great.
The prices are not overly expensive so it is a good place to enjoy creative French cuisine.
Le Menu is $125 per head.
5
Excellent fare; great service. Have been pleased every time we've dined here. Keep it up. Varied menu choices.
4
Hosted a small group of clients over a festive business lunch. They couldn't stop gushing over the food and the creative plating. Service was attentive and prompt. A memorable experience.
4
My colleagues and I came here for the lunch set menu. It costs $42++ for three courses. I had the duck liver, beef tenderloin and the ice cream. Everything was well done and taste exquisite. The service crew is very attentive and explain every dish to us. If you order tea or coffee here, they will also give you some desserts. Highly recommended
5
As a food & beverage person like me, I could say this is the best which are not easy to find it, great atmosphere, staff, food and wine, I decided to took a five courses set menu @138.- with two glasses of Charbis & a glass of Pinot Noir, awesome for all and I'm sure I will be back and will spread my words around when I'm back to my country, don't trust on me by reading this review you must visit and prove by yourself, thanks chef for visit on my table to explain your dessert that make it more valuable for price paid
4
The place is quite spacious and has 2 areas.The outside area has soothing ambiance with a variety of seating options.You also have the bar as well as the open kitchen. Inside you have the dance floor as well as a small sitting area as well.The ambiance is good. On my recent visit, I had a beer along with chicken wings.The wings were not at all up to the mark and were priced astronomicall
5
I was looking for a quaint fine dining restaurant providing a personal feel; the description and reviews for Rhubarb fit the bill. Food, wine, ambiance, service and every aspect of the place was worth the cost. Definitely a place to go to for a celebration or if you just feel like having a wonderful evening. Rhubarb will leave you satisfied and looking forward for the next time you get an excuse to go and have another meal there
4
This was a very nice lunch experience! Food was excellent and service was good though a little pompous the way the French know how!
However it is just another small French restaurant in Singapore, not special enough for me to go back to.
5
My friends took me to this lovely place for my birthday. Nice little quaint restaurant with trained service staff. The food was nice though not up to the finesse of the likes of Joel Robuchon but still, worth the price we paid for.
5
We had a tasting menu and asked the sommelier to pair wines with courses. Excellent choice, very good service and pace. Will go again.
5
I was looking for a special place to take my girlfriend out in City for dinner to celebrate her birthday and Rhubarb was perfect in every way possible. The service from the staff was warm, welcoming and very professional, they were so attentive to us. The food was divine so rich and deep in flavours every dish worked perfectly. in particular the The Wagyu Onglet for main & Foie Gras as starter which were our personal favourites from LeMenu.I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking to take your loved one out for an intimate french fine dinning experience in Singapore. 10/1
5
My husband researched this wonderful restaurant and took me here on my birthday.From the beginning till the end the experience was beautiful. The chef himself came and served us the soup and spoke to us. A wonderful, brilliant restaurant with thought provoking food and food art. It is also not too expensive which is wonderful when one is visiting and wants to get the best of this city even though it is numbingly expensive. A must visit!
4
Managed to get a seat after several failures in reservation.Service is very attentive and friendly. With around 7 tables, when it's filled up, service becomes more speedy.Due to our greed and long time desire, we decided to go A La Carte so we can try more and we end with 4 starters, 2 mains, 1 dessert and 2 wines for 2 people :pEmulsion is very creative. All the ingredients and flavours are nicely blended and it allows you to truly feel the smooth of combination of white onion, cream and truffle. Foie gras is well cooked as well, a good performer. The dessert Rhubarb is also something interesting that you can try.All the others are all GOOD dishes but can be better or creative to live up to Rhubarb's reputation. It somewhat lacks the wow factor for a upscale french restaurant.Hamichi is good, is like a sashimi course. When writing the review, at first I hardly recall it since it is like a usual, fresh sashimi. Ballotine is good, the fruit flavoured cubes enlightened the heavy meat a bit. Wagyu, the tenderloin meat is also good. The pigeon, is tender and succulent. However, its overall taste is all mild sweet, which is a bit too mild, say a bit pale.Ambiance would be perfect with more lighting, maybe just one or two wall lamps.It is a must visit french restaurant in Singapore (long time top 3), and of course you won'r feel bad about going there
5
Situated in the vibrant Duxton Hill you could easily walk past Rhubarb if you didn't know where to go. Luckily we know exactly where to go and had a confirmed booking - otherwise we would have missed out on a fantastic eveningWe got a great table right by the kitchen and all evening we could follow the team carefully prepare our 5 courses dinner with a high degree of routine, sofistication and elegance that suites a well functioning kitchen.Our courses were in order: foie gras, an emulsion of white onion and trouffles puree, langoustines, beef and a dessert. Followed by coffee.Out of the five courses four worked really really well. Created with passion, served with insight - these small pieces of artwork contained so much taste it was a delight. Really fantastic. Especially the Foie gras and the beef were close to magic.Unfortunately the langoustines were not up to kitchen standards this day - so they were replaced with Challops to begik with. In my opinion this particular dish didn't quite live up to the others - a quick save, but a little bit bland. Maybe I had just looked forward to Langoustines? However, I truely acknowledge the kitchen for setting and living up to their high standards - because that paid off.The wine list contained a good selection of wines from around the World. Something for all to enjoy.The staff was present and mindfull helping to make this a great evening
5
Superb food, great service and a really warm welcome. Very much enjoyed our evening. If you're looking for an inexpensive evening this is not the place to go. We paid approx $560++ for 2 (we did drink some nice wine). ...but well worth it. We will be back.
4
I enjoyed lunch with two friends.Everything was great until the main course.I ordered beef and found the meat tough. I've had beef at a Michelin star restaurant in Provence and found the cut of beef to be very tough, too. I don't know if it's always that way in French cuisine..
5
Love the decor, it matches the focus and direction given by the service staff & chef. The maitre'd is extremely charming, and attentive. The chef is from a renown Chef school in London, and has developed an extremely credible pedigree. The food throughout is superb, the pigeon especially a favourite of mine. Singapore lacks restaurants that are consistent (service, execution, charm, overall experience etc), and in my view are severely lagging global peers. Rhubarb is the one changing this view; and in my opinion, superior to the others wrangling for top spot (e.g. Les Amis etc). Keep doing what you are doing Jerome and Pau
5
5* french food at amazing prices! Great service and great wines at very good prices. Limited tables so it doesn't get too crowded and noisy, but they could be a little bit more generous with the cheeses!
5
The food was delicious, creative menu served professionally. Good selection of wines, great ambience. Brilliant chef specials!
5
Truly enjoyed this lunch, we chose the lunch menu and it was fantastic food. The service was really superb (at least for European standards), both gentlemen did everything with a smile even if they were not serving customers. Can highly recommend this place!
4
We tried the set dinner. Some of the dishes were really good, like the veloutÃ©, the wagyu beef and the dessert.Service was excellent and rather intimate given the size of the restaurant. I will want to try their a la carter menu perhaps in a lunch setting
5
Visited with my sister and we loved the place.Small restaurant with only 6 or so tables, white table cloth. Food was delicious. I would call it modern French with subtle fusion. There were some unconventional pairings like scallop and fois gras but they all worked really well! Looking forward to going back

In one word, our experience at Rhubarb Le Restaurant was "grey", like the dominant color of the interior. My wife and I spent a Saturday night at this small restaurant on Duxton Hill. We had the 6-course pre-set menu and a bottle of wine. The food was average for an upscale French restaurant and lacked any "wow" factor. The combination of ingredients was creative, but not a good match in some cases. For example, we did not find that pomegranate is a good partner for pork fillet. The service started well, but seemed to be overwhelmed when the restaurant filled up. The first courses were served at a good rhythm, but the delivery slowed down after the appetizers. We do like our breaks, but 45 minutes wait between courses is a bit too long. When we reminded the waiter that we wanted to go faster, he rushed through the rest of the menu and did not even offer the (optional) cheese platter. We ended up spending 3 hours for the 6 courses, and although the restaurant has only 7 tables, the waiters never had a personal word. The focus seemed to be on other repetitive customers. The wine list is dominated by expensive french wines, but there were a few affordable wines from other geographies. The ambiance at the restaurant could be enhanced with better lighting or simply a candle on the table. Overall, we were disappointed with Rhubarb Le Restaurant
5
Went 3 times in la rhubarb, and the quality of the lunch set is great.Congratulations to the french waiters who are doing a great job and the service niceThe lunch set was very nice, the french quail was great and the new desert with oil olive cake is excellent. Congrats to the chef The prawn tartare was tasting very mice also, i tried the english breakfast as an entree it was fun but would not consider as the same level than the tartareAgain a michelin star level restaurantThe josmeyer alsace white wine is fantasti
3
I had dinner with my wife at rhubarb and we both had the menu. The food is good and the service as well. However, there is nothing exceptional about the food itself and I don't think it deserves to be number 2 of the restaurants in Singapore. The abalone they served us were a bit tough and chewy, the amuse bouche with a cone and egg raw were not great, the duck was overcooked. The beef was good as well as the raspberry desert.Overall, it felt a bit overfull which is odd for a nouvelle cuisine restaurant
5
Brought my wife there for her birthday dinner. Great staff, nice ambience and, above all, very creative takes on French cuisine. Had a good conversation with the manager about restaurants needing to remain competitive on the burgeoning Singapore food scene and I must say that Rhubarb's dishes maid them stand out in the crowd. Tip: try their emulsions. They are fabulous
5
We had dinner just before Christmas passing through Singapore for a few days. Excellent meal, good service and wine advice. The dishes were thoughtfully put together, and complemented one another even though we ordered a la carte. We also had a nice chat with one of the partners about the Singapore food scene. Over all a great experience
4
I went there with no expectations and had a pleasant surprise with their starters and the steak was excellent.
Could be more flexible on the ordering of set menu and all carte I feel.
5
Rhubarb delivers on all ways! Fantastic service, great tasting & creative food (big high five to Chef Paul). Classic interior.
Anytime again! Oh, and those great selection of wines!!!
5
I can't count the number of times I've been to Rhubarb since it opened. It's consistently wonderful - intimate, neither too noisy nor too quiet, beautiful food, a great wine list and knowledgeable, friendly staff. It's no wonder Rhubarb is TripAdvisor's #1 Singapore restaurant. Well worth a visit
4
Rhubarb delivers on all accounts. We had the full dinner set, and was taken on a culinary journey containing interesting Asian ingredients paired with impeccable French techniques.The only criticism I have is that the portions are slightly to large. In particular one should not serve foie gras in such large portions, since it tends to leave you slightly queasy, and this will unfortunately dampen the enthusiasm for the remaining courses.That being said, every dish was beautifully made and well balanced. The price is very reasonable and I highly recommend visiting this restaurant!
5
My hubby has a neck of reserving the best places to dine & stay. This time he was spot on again - I guess it was easy with Rhubarb: look at their rating . Finding parking is not easy but there is valet service available. Restaurant isn't huge. Kitchen is fully exposed & there was no smell from it so you can still put on your best. I always thought an open exposes lots more than the equipment. I liked what i saw. Chef Paul is not only talented, he treats his team of local sous very well! Paul comes out of the kitchen to interact with the guests with dishes he had prepared. V nice touch this is . Service from Jerome & his colleague was tip top too! Glad we went for wine by the glasses because Jerome's selection was spot on & truly yummy. We went for Le Menu to be able to try as many items on the menu & I'm glad we did. Our 5 senses were given a fab treat. I had the Cod & hubby went for Wagyu. Both delectable! If you are going there soon, you must try the Artichoke emulsion finished off with a generous shaving of fresh black winter truffle. Rendered us speechless. Since the wine list & Le Menu changes, we'll definitely go back & this time, with friends. Bravo to Paul & Jerome! It's pure hard work to run a successful restaurant & you both do it tres bien!

Had dinner with my wife. Awesome gastronomical experience. Service is superb from Jerome, Restaurant Manager. And complementing him is the amazing food prepared by head chef, Paul. Worthy of its #1 rating. Excellent food, Service and just an amazing dining experience from start till end! Well done Rhubarb.
5
Absolute gem of a restaurant.Quite comparable to restaurants demanding 3-4 times the price. Classy but cosy restaurant with the best service I've ever gotten outside a Michelin star restaurant. Amazing food with great attention to detail.All in all the best value for money, within the fine dining segment in Singapore
5
A fantastic restaurant,the staff is very helpfull and has great knowledge of food and Wine. Only 7 tables,so be sure to book. Quality of the food is the best i have tried in Singapore. Had dinner there on tuesday,IT was so good that i went back on wednesday. Winelist was good,and very reasonable prices. If you are in Singapore this restaurant is a must

I have visited this restaurant for more than 5 times, with friends and family. We love the food! The chef is creative and every dish was so beautifully created, appealing to both the eyes and palate. Service was fast and efficient but our first visit was the best, very attentive service and chef even came out to talk to us and explained how we should enjoy the emulsion of mushroom which is a must try in this restaurant and best soup we have ever taken. We have recommended a number of our friends there. -by Stephanie Lee

The restaurant has a nice setting, with only 7 round tables, warm colors and low lights for a cosy atmosphere. Perfect for a romantic diner or with good friends :)The food is amazing, real french gastronomie, and the wine just perfect match. We chose the menu and loved it all. My favorites : artichoke emulsion with black truffle and the stoved foie gras. Desert was stunning too.I definitely recommend Rhubarb 
5
High end cuisine, high end wines, great service, quiet atmosphere. Not cheap, but well worth it. The maitre de can guide you quite well.
5
Went to Rhubarb for an anniversary dinner, food was excellent and the service was fantastic. Highly recommend if you want to spend a bit more for a special occasion.
5
I booked Rhubarb as special dinner for my wife. We arrived 30 mins before our reservation time. This is a Small but lovely restaurant. Wonderful food and great services. One of my best dining experience in Singapore!
5
Incredible food pair with the best service. Went for a la carte menu but I regretted not to have gone for their 5 dish degustation menu. Definitely a must went I come back to Singapore. Thanks!!!
5
Rhubarb is my go-to restaurant for a good dinner with close friends, a celebration or just to cheer my spirits after a crap week at work. Paul and Jerome are perfectionists first, and that matters when it comes to the finer touches that sets exquisite from the norm. Food is great, the wines are on point and I never have to worry or "direct" for service, which sadly is too common in Singapore
5
This is a delight!Cozy atmosphere, great service, EXCEPTIONAL food!I have been lucky enough to enjoy some superb restaurants and food around the world, this deserve a try. Fresh and willing to explore and try stimulating combinations. We also enjoyed being offered wines to compliment each dish. it worded very well and allowed each person to enjoy a different wine Really worth a tr
5
We went to Rhubarb for lunch and had the chef's degustation. Really good value and incredible food. As it was all prepared bespoke and not from the menu I can't tell you what things were called but everything was great - especially a truffle infused emulsion, which was just incredible. The waiting staff were tremendous - never flustered or appearing busy despite just the two of them for around eight table. This is something that is sorely missed in all but the priciest restaurants in Singapore (and some of them miss it too!), so it was pleasant to find it in a restaurant that is actually very reasonably priced, at least at lunch time
5
Chef Paul Longworth is an amazingly talented chef and it is reflected in the wonderful food that he creates at Rhubarb Le Restaurant, which he co-founded with Mr. Jerome Desfond. The dishes here are subtle and exquisitely uncomplicated, yet multi-faceted and intense. During my last visit, I had the Cod in Black Charcoal, a new addition in the menu. A seemingly simple dish, the cod is immensely flavorful and visually impressive as well (the cod is completely black on the outside!). Another outstanding dish is the pigeon confit with chicken jus and grapes ‘a la Aussignac’, an iconic dish which the restaurant is renowned for. Maître D and co-partner of the restaurant, Mr. Jerome Desfond, has an air of elegance but is always très genial. The French gentleman loves sharing his extensive knowledge of wine to clients and brings a bit of the French grace and flair in the service. Working alongside him is Francis, a good-looking and charming young Frenchman who is proficient and professional. Together, they provide diners with impeccable service that is efficient yet warm. With such phenomenal food and impressive service, my fellow diners and I had an enthralling experience and a wonderful time at Rhubarb Le Restaurant. 
5
A very innovative chef and a very personal staff. Only 7 tables on the ground floor and an open kitchen makes one feel special. The chef likes to contrast sweet and salty/savoury, maybe a bit too much, but the combinations are lovely. Try the Hamachi! Yes, with a brigade of 9 for so few guests, the price is hefty, but this is Singapore. See you next year
4
Sleek interior, kind welcome. Been here before and was impressed. This evening- me and my wife, a bit of a celebration. Me Foi Gras, Emelie emulsion of artichoke with black and white truffle - fabulous. Me cod cooked in black charcoal- great appearance - black and white - great taste. Emelie - pigeon dish, breast and confit, rhubarb and rose purée, grapes a la Aussignac. Fabulous. Desserts - looked nice but a bit too complexed for our taste. Would have been a 5/5 if simpler straighter desserts. Service perfect and right distance/ friendliness. Will come again. Get here before crowd discovers.
4
When we tried dinner at Rhubarb that was great time. The food was good and showed nice on plate. Good service , wonderful chef. We will go again.
5
Jerome and the team were absolutely incredible, for which the chef was extremely passionate on ensuring every dish tasted amazing. The team made sure we were comfortable and even took the time in giving us the best tips of things to do in Singapore.Wish we could go back soon!Thanks to the team for a great night
5
I am just an ordinary guy without much of experiences of French fine dining and Yet, I enjoyed them very much.Every time the dishes come out, I felt like experiencing the new world! They were so good.THANKS RHUBARB FOR SUCH AN AMAZING SERVICE!By the way, my friend who I had dinner with, he also loved everything of it.
5
Excellent French cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere. Only 6 tables in this restaurant. We were a table of 4, took the menu, and the chef was very flexible to accommodate variation requests for vegetarian as well as pregnancy diets. Outstanding seafood. Very good wines at fair prices.
5
I needed a good restaurant to take clients to in Singapore, and the reviews on here seemed good, so I took a chance. How happy I am that I did. This is a small intimate restaurant, with only a few tables; an incredibly friendly owner / maitre d; an open kitchen; and head chef happy to talk to you about the menu, restaurant, his career etc. The atmosphere is very relaxed, not stuffy at all, and nothing is too much for them to do for you. We had the tasting menu, which was very well priced and very tasty. The chef tailored the menu to individual tastes without any fuss (something rare from a top quality restaurant). All in all I couldn't recommend this restaurant enough.
5
This Is a long overdue review of Rhubarb, but it is difficult to give advice on a place I love so much. Since its opening I went about 6 times and never got bored.Rhubarb strike a perfect balance if many areas:- the atmosphere is just formal enough to make you feel like your dinner is a special occasion but relax enough to make you feel at ease- the wine list is proficient, offering a wide variety of French and new world wines. You can find very interesting bottles at decent prices and Jerome, the manager, knows his wine well.- the food finally is a perfect blend of French classics rejuvenated by some modern and Asian twists. Some of the ingredients are directly sourced from France, some fishes from Japan,.. never bored I tell you.Whether it is with the degustation menu or a la carte the prices are in quite reasonable for the quality of the experience, good surprise the bill is not as hefty as it would be in lesser places.Rhubarb managed since its opening to have efficient and courteous staff
4
This was our first dining experience at Rhubarb. The food was excellently done and beautifully plated. Paul, the chef, did a wonderful job with the pigeon which was perfectly tender. The restaurant was cosy and service by Francis was faultless. Overall the dinner was reasonably priced. I will certainly make a repeat visit to try Paul's other surprises
5
I can only echo the previous reviews: we had an outstanding experience at Rhubarb. The lunch menu at $42 was an incredible deal for the food quality and presentation. Top notch restaurant, presenting French cuisine in a creative manner by chef Paul Longworth. Super competent and welcoming service. This is a very small restaurant with only seven tables, so reserve early to avoid disappointment
5
Based on the Tripadvisor reviews, we thought that this restaurant would be an excellent ending to our visit. The reviews were absolutely correct - the entire experience was outstanding. The ambience, the service and particularly the food all combined for a very memorable evening. Each course was lovingly created and presented. The amuse bouche was a salmon tartare. My husband doesn't like raw food, so the chef prepared a second selection for him. That was indicative of the entire evening - personal service and attention. Make sure you make Rhubarb one of your dining selections while in Singapore.
5
We have followed Paul, the chef/owner around his Singapore journey ever since he came here a few years ago.He continues to get better. His Michelin roots show in the modern methods and beautiful presentation of the dishes.The various items are a tad on the big side for my taste. The last course took an effort to finish
5
Delicious food, excellent service with a magic ambience. Dine while watching your next course being lovingly prepared. A must visit restaurant.
5
I met Chef Paul several years ago and thought his approach to food was passionate. Have finally found him again at Rhubarb - his approach to food is now magical. What a wonderful, sensual dining experience, with tastebuds dancing at every course. Amazing!
5
No hype, just excellent Japanese precision French cuisine where every ingredient holds its flavor yet melds into an delectable whole.
I wonder how this place has managed to remain a secret. It's certainly up there with the best. Rivals jaan hand down.
5
Although we've read the great reviews of Rhubarb we've never got around to going until the other night when we chanced upon the restaurant at 1015pm after having been out for cocktails. Since they close the kitchen at 1030pm we didn't expect to be able to have dinner but they quickly readied a table for us and welcomed us in. Service was excellent throughout, attentive and friendly without being overbearing.We were originally planning just to have the main course but ended up sharing two starters - we had foie gras with smoked chocolate (delicious) and the hamachi, also superb.For main course we all chose the pork but they didn't have enough pork for 4 so one of us had quail, also just stunning. I did find the some of the dishes on the menu sounded so unusual that you were not sure if you fancied it, and I am quite an adventurous foodie normally but having been once I think I'd probably try them next time.It is absolutely superb fine-dining.We didn't feel the need for a dessert but looking at what came to tables nearby I'd say it is probably superb as well.Wine was good too - and surprisingly for a French inspired restaurant they had a good selection of New World wines. Good advice on wine pairings we felt. The only thing we felt was that the lighting was rather white and cold, just a touch too light and a touch too much like a corporate away-day venue rather than an intimate and romantic restaurant. Restroom (unisex) was also rather small, functional and not as clean as you'd expect in a restaurant of this calibre
5
Wanted to treat a food gourmand to a nice meal and searched hard to find a place that would not disappoint. Picked Rhubarb based on Tripadvisor reviews and was so pleased. The food was excellent. We took the chef special menu at lunch. Every course was just sublime. We started with a foie gras in cone appetizer which was so good I could have had 5 for lunch! That was followed by a soup that was really a foamy concoction of savory and sweet. I could have licked the bowl! We had quail done 2 ways. The sides were also done really well. Dessert was also good; good enough for me to stray away from my diet!All in all, an excellent meal. My foodie friend declared that she would be back, which is testimony of the food
5
I was lucky enough to dinner twice in this delicious restaurant. The first time was really magig because I was accompanied with a friend of Paul's Chef. Paul prepared us a special menu according to his day humor. I can admit you that his humor was magnificently good. Everything was completed ! Do not wait GO
5
me and a group of my friends come back to rhubarb after almost 1 year.what a good decission.food cooked by chef paul was really outstanding.service very professional.i will not wait another year to come to such a good resyaurant.well done Rhubarb team,job well done
5
Had a fantastic meal, the food served was full of different flavours and textures and beautifully presented. The service was great, very friendly and as interactive as you want, with both the matre de and the chef.The wine list is extensive and mostly french and not expensive.We ordered a la carte and ended up with two extra starters because the chef wanted us to try them.We mentioned it was our anniversary and the desert turned with happy anniversery written on the plate in Chocolate, a lovely touch.A fantastic little gem for foodies.Book early to avoid disappointmen
5
This was our 1st time at Rhubarb although one of our party had been several times before. We had a 7 course menu with wine to accompany each course. The menu had to be changed when we arrived as two of us could not eat seafood. No trouble at all to the chef who quickly replaced a couple of courses where necessary. Each course was fabulous, taste , texture presentation all exquisite. The wine complimented the food superbly.Staff were extremely helpful and overall one the best evenings out we have ever had
5
Decided to come here out of curiosity due to the tripadvisor ranking . Situated in the quaint though crowded tanjong pagar and duxton area, it is smallish with only 7 tables, so book earlyThe British chef owner used to work for Au petit salut and decided to branch out on his ownThis is classical French food with some modern updates. The menu has a choice of a la carte or 5 course set and we chose the latter. After the amuse bouche, the 1st course of abalone was good and unusual for French food. Then came "corn soup" which was done up as a mousse . A large slab of foie gras followed and it was good. The main of beef was excellent and the potato side was done up as mousse. The raspberry dessert was excellent and it crackles and pops. And it was done up as a mousse tooHad a chat with the friendly chef laterOverall good food (though there was a lot of mousse we noticed), service and ambience
5
We had dinner here recently. The food is of a very high standard; with immaculate technique and clean strong flavours.
If this restaurant was in London you would struggle to get a table.

....go the distance?
Great food - excellent service . Need to relax and .. Keep it up. Will revisit in a couple of months and see
4
Tuning around to find the restaurant .rhubab very clean helpfully staff. food taste is good. however the price quite expensive
5
Great for a celebration or a romantic date. The restaurant is well designed and very private with just 7 tables. The 5-course set menu is very good - the highlights for me were the sweet corn appetizer and foie gras appetizer. The set menu is a wonderful experience and I enjoyed some flavours and foods I don't normally enjoy. I think the chef is quite creative and it's clear that he's passionate about what he's doing. Total bill was $400 for two set menus and some wine. The only minor critique I have is that the waiter seemed hesitant to give a recommendation on which main to have. And one of the plums in the foie gras appetizer was much more sour than the other
5
Rhubarb is undoubtedly one of the best fine dining restaurants in Singapore, with an excellent chef, well balanced menu that has good selection without being too large, and excellent service with an experienced team from other fine dining restaurants in Singapore.We have visited twice and each time delighted by the fineness, inventiveness and overall quality of every item. This is a fine dining experience, and is certainly quite expensive, but Rhubarb remains half the price (or less) of the more famous fine dining restaurants, and this is exactly why any lover of fine dining should visit. The small dining room with only room for around 20 diners lends a private, personalized and quiet atmosphere, and the chef and maitre d'hotel are always attentive and willing to discuss the food, wine and experience
5
I've been to Rhubarb 3 times now and every time it is still as good so I decided that it was rare enough for me to write a review!To sum it up it is a sure value, each time we had innovative and delicious dishes, excellent service with personnel ready to recommend and advise.And not to forget, a great wine list for which you are happy to pay for, for once in Singapore
5
Rhubarb is located in a quaint shophouse located at Duxton Hill, and the moment you walk into the restaurant, you are greeted by a friendly staff. We had some drinks outdoor while waiting for the rest of our friends to arrive and were promptly served although we were seated outdoor. We ordered from the a la carte menu, and when the food arrived, the presentation was exquisite and the staff was there to explain what we are having and the ingredients on each of our plate. The quality of the ingredients and cooking was top notch. Definitely recommend this place for fine dining and a good time with family and friends. Reservation must be made in advance
5
I eat out fairly often in Singapore and have seen a tide of new restaurants opening recently. I last ate at rhubarb shortly after it opened and after almost a year later I'm amazed just how good they are. Consistency is always a weak spot here but this place just keeps on delivering, from a great yet well priced wine list to a really well thought & executed menu. As my title says, this place is rock solid and will go on to achieve great things.
5
I've been to Rhubarb so many times after my pleasant first experience and feels almost obligated to write this review. Everything was still as amazing as before, if not even better! You feel always instantly settled in this cozy setting, with familiar and friendly faces. Despite the open kitchen, it is so quiet. I love watching the Chefs at work!Menu has changed since the last time I was there, but the cooking of my beef is just the way it was before, exactly to my liking! Talking about consistency being the biggest challenge for the f&b industry in Singapore, Rhubarb definitely has it! The wine list is still great, and they always have slight changes for their wine by the glass and it's always pleasant discoveries for me. I can't say how much I like coming back to this place and would definitely recommend this place for all occasions
5
I've been to Rhubarb a few times now, and we are always having a great time there,Chef Paul surprise us all the time with new dishes and special just for us as we tried everything on the menu...And Jerome, the manager got good recommendations on wines...All of that comes at a very reasonable price for a fine dining restaurant..I Just love i
5
Great service and tremendous food, you won't be disappointed. The French sommelier front of house who I believe is a co-owner certainly knows his stuff, even if bought our own wine. really enjoyed all the courses.
5
First time here and read online they've 2 kinds of set lunch. SGD 42++ or SGD 68++ chef special. My friend ordered the 42 lunch set while I go for the Chef Special. Difference is Chef special has 2 appetizer instead of 1. Main course is more "exotic", it was beef for me but cook to perfection. However, I find the beef a tad too fat (I'm sure those who love wagyu beef will love it). The first appertizer was beautifully presented with fresh tuna cubes in a glass. Second appetizer is egg white whipped to a bowl of soup. Very delicious though is a bit too sweet. Dessert is a delicious choc peanut cake with the ice-cream which I don't like. If I didn't hear wrongly, waiter said is the taste of Hay?? My UK friend said it was very interesting and likes it, I don't. My friend's lunch set was very good. He had pork belly as his main which he loves it. His dessert is so cool! it was in a glass with rumbling sound of sweets exploding, I can't describe well. It was very delicious, I wish I'd his dessert. At the end of the meal, chef brought out an array of sweets. 2 each - Choc, small biscuits and a grapefruit jelly. This resto reminds me of Pollen. When Pollen first started, they were brilliant but has dwindled to cut cost. Service is good though I've to say they took a long time to serve our main course. I'll certainly be back but SGD 42 set will be enough for me. ;
4
My wife and I enjoyed with the foods, but we were a bit nervous of an expensive French meal in Singapore. Would it be stuffy or pretentious? Difficult to tell from the web site. Rhubarb turned out to be a really excellent restaurant for an intimate and very high quality experience of modern French cuisine. The food was visually exciting and delicious with unexpected and artistic flair
4
Our last dinner at Rhubarb was 2 weeks ago. To say the chef is a thinking chef is an understatement. Chef has given a lot of thoughts in planning and preparing his cuisine. It's easy for any chefs to work with top products sourced from around the world. But Paul Longworth doesn't need the highly prized produces to turn Rhubarb's kitchen into a gem! Paul, in his usual quiet way, prepared an exceptional dish from a simple fish. A sea bream tartare with fish liver on crispy cracker, quail egg and a little caviar to add a bling. For main, I had the classic poultry dish, the roast pigeon breast in pink, confit leg, caramelised and served with onion, sweet corn and pigeon jus...simply delicious, cooked to perfection and faultless. I'm not against BYOB but from a F&B operator's perspective, wine revenue comprises as high as 30% to 40% of total revenue. I fully agreed with what Mr Wee of Lo&Behold told The Business Times last weekend, "...fine dining business is not for the faint hearted in Singapore...". I'm always excited to open the wine menu and to have a short chat with Jerome about his wines. His wines are carefully selected, good to superb quality, small producers mostly from Rhone and Burgundy and importantly, reasonably priced. Anyways, who needs a Chateau Lafite or Petrus or DRC when having a family dinner? Chef and Jerome always make our children, aged 10 and 8, feel special when having their meals at Rhubarb. The kitchen would always prepare extra serving of caramelised grapes for our children. Touch and feel the soft layer of your dining table, the well pressed table cloth, the extra thickness of the floor carpet, the sound absorbing wall paper, the lighting inside the restaurant, the art pieces and lastly, so quiet the open kitchen is visible to all, the fresh flowers personally arranged by Jerome...etc. Who could fault this cosy little gem sitting on Duxton Hill
5
It is not often that you are impressed by a resturant. Rhubarb has a delicious and inventive menu, impeccable service and is ideal for a special occasion. We left feeling like it was value for money, and that we were taken care of by the staff incredibly well. We will be back.
5
Come here for the food.Had dinner here twice. If I am not wrong there was only set menu.The Pigeon and the soup was excellent.We did not bring our own wine as either the corkage is too expensive ($60?) or we were not allowed to bring our own?It will be good if we could byo as their wine which we have tried on both visits were not to our liking
4
This is a tiny gem of a restaurant tucked away in Duxton Hill producing some wonderfully creative and tasty dishes. The dinner set is S$138/head and lunch set is S$42/head. We had dinner there in January 2015. The white onion emulsion (which is their "soup" course) was outstanding and the scallop dish featured plump and juicy scallops. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for somewhere special to try.
5
My wife and tried this restaurant last night, and despite rarely writing reviews I felt compelled to do so after this experience. I say experience as to call it dinner would be to undersell it. The welcome on arrival was professional and friendly, and standards did not drop from this. We ordered the tasting menu, with one fussy exception (which was replaced without fuss and tasted beautifully) and each course was delicious. We have eaten in myriad Michelin-starred restaurants and this compared and beat many of them. Our host proved himself as adept as a somellier than as a greeter, with a beautiful French suggestion, that was cheaper than what we were initially going for!I won't spoil the surprise for those who like that but each course was presented, cooked and tasted perfectly and we would absolutely go back again if we didn't live several thousand miles away. If you're in Singapore, love good good, appreciate good service at reasonable prices (relative) then you'd be mad not to eat here.
4
The setting of the restaurant is nice and cozy. We ordered a 3 course set lunch and special chef menu. Special chef menu is a 4 course meal where the chef will decide what he will serve depending on the ingredients he has that day. There is an surprise element in this menu. The food served is simply delicious. The chef also came up and chat with us. The food is worth every cent we paid
3
They aren't interested in kids, The decor is Glasgow mental health clinic. Food was very slow...you can cook a sheep in 40 minutes never mind a chop! The food looks great though but this place doesn't do it universally. It will die so move on
1
You will only like this restaurant if you like super finedining. The restaurant is very expensive and the ambienceand service is very stiff. Did not feel comfortable and was not happy based on the money we spent.
5
Rhubarb what a beautiful name you cant ignore to visit it if you are in Singapore. Everything from starters to desserts were amazing. Chicken curry was also amazing.
5
I had the pleasure of enjoying a wonderful evening with my wife at Rhubarb. The food was exceptional and having lived and entertained in Singapore for 13 years, I believe I have some experience to say that the service and attention to detail was equally exceptional. I have read some of the negative comments, which frankly made no sense. This is a five star restaurant and everything about it is 5 star. I asked for a slight change to one item on the menu, which was met with complete flexibility and a desire to please, this is something one does not always experience. The wine list offers a wide selection of wines for all tastes and budgets. This is a restaurant I will definitely revisit.
5
We spent a really nice time at Rhubarb yesterday nightFirst, welcoming was perfect: Jerome and his waiters are doing a wonderful job. Staff is really friendly.Second, food was really good! Chef Paul is doing amazing dishes! Scallop&pork belly or foie gras were excellent! Cheese plate definitely worth it!It's expensive but not too much for a fine dining restaurant.Do not hesitate to book your table
5
Carefully crafted and meticulously prepared dishes with a clever play of complementary ingredients. Once we tasted the appetisers of cured trout with salmon roe and caviar then the impeccable white onion emulsion with black truffle dressing and basil oil, we knew we were in for a treat!The foie gras was a juicy generous piece, perfectly singed and crispy on the outside and melting soft on the inside. The pigeon confit with grapes a la Aussignac was a deserving signature piece. Beef Wagyu was very good too. The dessert was unique - smoked hay ice cream went well with the chocolate and peanut butter torte. Don't forget to sample the petit fours - mini melt-in-your-mouth macaroons and truffle chocolates to end a memorable dinner. Service was attentive and helpful. 
5
We wondered past this restaurant in the lovely street of Duxton Hill and on impulse decided to return for the set menu lunch. Quite the best meal we've ever had in Singapore. And in a city not known for its value, incredible value. Every course was a taste and texture sensation including a stunning extra amuse bouche to start with. We enjoyed the intimacy of only 7 tables and the quietness - oh for more carpeted restaurants! Staff were lovely and it was great to watch them happily ensconced in the open kitchen. Don't miss it - particularly if you're staying in Chinatown.
4
Overall a very good evening, well worth the money.room is soberly decorated and was pleasantly quiet.Considerate service and creative menu. The chef really plates preparation out of the beaten path from excellent quality ingredients.My reason for not scoring 5point rating lies with a couple unfortunates association of flavor : delicate scallop with robust pork pallet ? buttery cod with strongly chorizo flavored quinoa ? all very well and tastily prepared certainly but the more subtle ingredient is clearly overpowered in both case
5
This is definitely a gem hidden in Duxton hill.Discrete from the outside, sobre inside, it has a pleasant interior.The service is very professional, efficient and careful.It started with a reservation on the phone, polite and warm, we were already looking forward to getting there.Excellent welcome, comfortable sitting, they know how to make you feel well there.Nice selection of courses at reasonable prices, and beautiful wines from over the world, with a particular accent on the French.The pace of service was great, not too fast, not too low, and always well done. The team is really great, chef, maitre d'hotel and waiters are motivated and smiling.The cuisine is superb with some great products properly elaborated: scallops, foie gras, pigeon, wagyu beef...The bread is very good too, crunchy and tasty, resist the temptation to have it with butter before your meal!Definitely a great place already, and we wish them success for the future
5
This restaurant is truly exceptional. From our arrival to the end we are been treated royally. The best part was the food; presentation, composition, taste, colors were magically crafted to perfection. I recommend to the fine diners in Singapore, to reserve a table and try the set menu presented by the chef
5
I dined at the restaurant last night with two other people for a business dinner and I can't say enough about how good the experience was.The service was excellent and attentive all evening and we never wanted for anything. We all chose to eat from the ala carte menu, the fois gras was excellent and so was the wagyu beef, there is an excellent wine list to go with the food and all three of the wines we chose were first rate. The kitchen is open to the restaurant and the chefs were busy all evening, at one stage the chef came over to explain the dishes to us and you could tell he was passionate about his food. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great French meal in Singapore
5
We had a beautiful dinner at Rhubard, Duxton hill in Singapore.
The menu and the quality of the food were outstanding, nothing else to say.
The service was caring and discreet.
Prices are not light but value for money is very unquestionable.
Will go again.
5
We enjoyed our lunch at this elegant French restaurant. The pace of service was efficient yet relaxed. As we were meeting friends to chat and catch up, it was great that the tables on the ground level dining room were well spaced out, and provided us with the privacy we wanted. The 3 course set lunch for $42++ is an incredibly great value for this excellent level of cooking, which reminded me of modern Michelin-starred restaurants I've visited abroad. Fittingly, many such restaurants also have a tradition of offering relatively affordable lunches. The various courses were beautifully presented and we savoured each mouthful, of our own and also our friends' orders. My favourite was the quail which was was tender and flavourful, and also the namesake rhubarb dessert. I'm tempted to go back for a special occasion to try Le Menu for $138++.
5
We had the set lunch and the chef's set menu, which, for a fine dining establishment, is very good value. The service staff was warm and polite, the chef took time to explain the food to us, and everything was prepared with care and dedication. Portions were sufficient and tasty. Hope to go back again soon
5
Bought my friend from Australia here as hadn't been back for a while. So glad that my friend found it amazing as much as I. For the types of services, quality/freshness of the food and the passion that goes into it, the place is more than great value. They were also very attentive to my gluten and dairy sensitivities. Recommended food that they could augment to suit such restrictions. My friend has Hokkaido scallops that she thought was one of the best scallops she ever had. I had New Zealand beef/steak that was the best I have had so far in town. I am surprised that Rhubarb hasn't made it to top 50 restaurants of Asia list. The Rhubarb dessert... simply sensational with the mouth popping candies...Wish they open on Sundays so I could go more often
2
We were happy to try the food here as we have heard about them from some friends. The food was decent and wine choices were reasonable. We enjoyed the deserts more than the mains, and plating of the dishes were typical french style. For a restaurant charging their prices, we thought service could have been better and more engaging

I was a bit nervous of an expensive French meal in Singapore. Would it be stuffy or pretentious? Difficult to tell from the web site. Rhubarb turned out to be a really excellent restaurant for an intimate and very high quality experience of modern French cuisine. The sommelier/waiter was genial and fluent in warming what could feel a slightly chilled environment at first. The food was visually exciting and delicious with unexpected and artistic flair. Pan-fried fois gras and scallops for starters ***** then lamb and beef for mains were truly memorable. Wine selection was very French and the sommelier was great at balancing our choices. All round superb. I loved the grey interior tone but with this much neutrality you need to improve the lighting. Its an easy fix and that will finish the experience. Food and service are perfect but the flatness of the grey and lightbox feel could be turned into a more intimate and warming feel that will better compliment your food. Get the halogens off the ceiling and onto the wall and add some beautiful votives for starters. With great lighting people will feel more relaxed and will return more

This is a surprisingly good restaurant. They seem to come and go on Duxton Hill but this one should last. Well spaced tables although I wasn't keen on the grey tablecloths. The set lunch is $42. A fishy amuse bouche and a good selection of bread and nice butter at the right temperature. My starter was a foie gras ballotine that was nice but made more special by the berries and fruit gels that accompanied it. My quail main course was exceptional. Two breasts and two legs perfectly cooked, not dry at all and with crisp skin, accompanied by a purple potato dish and wonderful fresh corn creamed and with something like samphire. The posset with jelly and granite was sour/sweet and very good to finish. I saw the pan fried fillet of fish with grilled endive on top that someone else was having and it looked wonderful. I will come again

Superlatifs abound at Le Rhubarb restaurant. A delight for both the eyes and the palette ! This restaurant is one of Singapore's hidden gems. We ate from the set lunchtime menu at $42++ and chose our wine from the ' by the glass' selection. Each dish delighted and white onion emulsion (offered by chef Paul Longworth as complementary) was truly sublime. The dessert, a bergamot posset, jelly and granite creation was an explosion of flavour. Perfect ! As for the service, it was crisp, yet friendly. A must visit

Really warm and inviting ambiance and delicious food! It's a small, intimate place, but does not seem overcrowded or overbooked. The staff is incredibly warm and attentive and the food really speaks for itself. It's so hard to find good restaurants that aren't overcrowded and noisy on a Friday or Saturday--super happy we discovered this place.Highly recommend it

Been to Rhubarb for dinner and i was really impressed.A small dining room maybe 7 or 8 round tables, I do love round table as it give more privacy, with a view of the gleaming open kitchenWe went for the tasting menu, 5 courses, and all of them were amazing, lot of different flavours, texture and very interesting combination of ingredients... really surprised by the quality and presentation. The Chef came up and explain a few of the dishes, and we enjoyed chating with him and the manager who recommended a nice bottle of wine, and an other half bottle to finish, at a reasonable price for Singapore standards,Overall a great experience, nice room, good wines amazing food at good priceWe will definitely come back

We spent a really pleasant culinary moment. Everything was surprising and really delicate, honestly we didn't expect something at this level.

Food wasn't outstanding. Wine was average. So it made it a bit expensive. The big question for me always is will I come again. I never did. Not because it was bad, it was just nothing outstanding I really wanted to go back for.

Rhubarb is a beautiful small restaurant with open kitchen concept.the head chef Paul and his partner Jerome treated us like royals.
Food presentation and quality at its best, accompanied by nice wine list.
great job rhubarb team, we will be back soon.

Lovely small calm room. Blessed relief from tables two inches apart.Service is very good but lacks warmth.Paul's food is very good and one senses that he is still developing and will get better.Good size and good selection wine menu.Hard to understand the connection between the name, Rhubarb and the menu?Needs to be more flexible on its corkage charges if you buy as well as bring wine

For anyone genuinely interested in superb innovative cuisine built on fine French foundations, Rhubarb the Restaurant is a must in Singapore. It hits the spot on every front - a warm welcome from Jerome who runs the front of house and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of wine, charming and informed waiting staff and a truly superb kitchen under the active direction of Paul who creates superb and innovative dishes with a special twist of creativity and an eagle eye for detail. Despite the pressures of a very busy kitchen Paul takes time to welcome guests in the restaurant, discuss with one the secrets of his remarkable cuisine - whether you are taking the superb value fixed price lunch menu, the intriguing chef's choice or eating a la carte. Add to that a small comfortable room in a delightful old area of Singapore and there is nothing else needed. Very special - a must for anyone who appreciates the huge effort that is put into the meals at Rhubarb David and Nic

Lovely small restaurant in a very pretty part of town, though a little lacking in atmosphere at lunchtime. The food was outstanding....party of 4 and we had the set lunch and every plate was ooohed, aahed and shared. Except for the Bergamot Posset. No way anyone was getting any of my dessert....it was perfection. And for top marks, a rarity indeed here in SG, the service was excellent. Only downside was the complete lack of low/medium priced wines. I'd highly recommend it for a top value 5* lunch and reckon I'll head back to try dinner

Thank You Chef, Management and Staff @ Rhubarb for making my birthday lunch a most memorable one. The food flavours and presentation were 'heavenly' - a wonderful dining experience. Service was attentive in every way. I hope the open kitchen concept - it instils immediate 'trust' for me with food preparation and staff calibre. I love the food and the intimacy of this lovely restaurant and I will definitely be back

Food at Rhubarb is some of the best we've had in Singapore, starters through to desserts. Presentation, flavour and quality of ingredients are top notch. Excellent wine list - the majority French.We found the decor a little drab though which we found affected the atmosphere a little. The open plan kitchen a nice touch.Service was professional and efficient.Costs about S$120 per person not including wine.Would have given it 5 Stars but we thought that the chef (owner) was not as welcoming as he should have been. He walked passed our table of a couple of occasions but did not stop to ask how the food was or even acknowledge our presence with a smile...can't say whether if was a one off as it was our first visit. We intend to go again though because of the quality of the food

If you are looking for a couples night, dinner date with friends of a break from the kids (read not suitable for kids) this place is awesome. Visiting with a vegetarian, pescetarian, meat lover and agnostic we were all very well catered for by the small but well compiled menu. If you are in Singapore visiting, make a booking before you arrive. It is truly worth it. If you live here, a great venue for that little bit more special evening with the one you love and friends. Great service (understated attentive) and great wine list. And a Mexican bar next door for after hours tequila ;-)

Had dinner recently with spouse and glad to have made a right choice in coming here . A semi fine dining ambience, with a open kitchen concept. We choose the set dinner menu which was really great ! Amongst my favourite dishes - white onion emulsion , wagyu beef, and pan seared foie gras. Every dish was beautifully plated and in an exquisite manner. I am happy with the service rendered to us. Overall a very positive experience. I will be sharing with my bros this hidden gem and will be coming back again very soon

Since my first visit last year when Rhubarb just opened, I've been hooked to the food, as well as the place. The open kitchen allows you to see the preparation of the food and how meticulous the chefs are in putting things together. What impresses me the most are the consistency in the presentation and the taste of the food, as well as the ever changing and reasonably priced wine list. The personalized and sleek service is also something hard to come by, especially when the chefs will bring the food to your table and explain the dishes! I still remember the little surprise from the Chef when it was my birthday! Well, if I start stating all the food and wine that I've had that left me with great memories, It'll take me days to finish. Definitely a great place for all occasions!

Four guests and I had a very enjoyable evening at Rhubarb last night and all agreed that food, wine and general ambience were amongst the best we have found in Singapore. Personally I would go a little further and say that the restaurant is now firmly one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore.The restaurant is located in a lovely shop house in Duxton Hill. There are around six to seven tables spaced out well so that (unlike many other restaurants) you do not feel packed and stacked. The open kitchen concept allowed for interaction with Chef Paul and his brigade from our table and it was fantastic to watch our dishes being lovingly prepared. Front of house manager Jerome was friendly and extremely helpful with our wine choices, which matched perfectly with our amazing meal. The wine list is very well thought out and very reasonably priceD if slightly French leaning, although I understand from Jerome that the restaurant are planning to expand the list further.We chose Le Menu (a six course menu with amuse bouche and petit fours) and did not regret our choice!As we were enjoying a lovely biscuity Deutz Williams 2000 champagne, my guests enjoyed a lovely confit egg with seaweed tartare, pearl cous cous and caviar. Not being the greatest fan of eggs, Chef Paul had kindly prepared a variation of another starter (an endive salad) and very thoughtfully brought into that some of the flavours of the starter being enjoyed by my guests. Both starters were lovely. The egg (I had to try it when I saw it!) was beautifully creamy and the salty/umami flavours and multi-layered textures of the dish were a great talking point. Equally, my salad was beautifully prepared and the same salty/umami flavours and multi/layered textures matched perfectly with the champage.Our next course was probably for me the highlight of the night. Beautifully presented white onion emulsion with black truffle dressing and basil oil was presented to the table. It was not at all what I had been expecting. An unctuous, sweet, fluffy, silky mass of foamed onion peppered with black truffle and flecked with basil oil, whose slightly bitter flavours helped to bring out the sweetness of this dish. With Jerome's help, I had chosen a nice Condrieu to accompany this dish and the beautiful dry fruit complexity of the wine matched fantastically with the sweet and earthy flavours of the emulsion. A third course of foie gras flecked with cocoa nibs, a quenelle or rhubarb and green apple was a lovely presentation of a classic pan seared foie gras was presented to four of us at the table. Personally, I am not usually a fan of seared foie gras as it is so easily ruined in the wrong hands. This foie gras was beautifully cooked and the whole table was quick to agree that what made the dish sing was the rhubarb, which had been slightly sweetened with a rose syrup. When combined together the sweet (foie gras, rose syrup), savoury (cocoa nibs) and tart (rhubarb and apple) elements of the dish melded together very successfully. In keeping with tradition, we had a lovely half bottle of sauternes - a bottle of Château Guiruaud 1998 - which was beautifully balanced with a slight hint of spice. One of my guests opted for an alternative dish and was served a beautiful scallop and pork belly with cauliflower and white chocolate purée. It was declared delicious and promptly scoffed with only his next door neighbour being offered a chance to render an opinion.At my insistence (as I had spotted a Château Figeac 1989) we all chose beef for our main course. It is rare for me to be lost for words with a dish but this was the one. The cut of wagyu onglet was full of flavour and served with a lovely roasted salsify but for me the star of the show was the quenelle of pickled walnuts served on the side. It has been many years since I have eaten pickled walnuts (an English delicacy made from young walnuts before they grow their shells). The nutty, sweet, earthy flavour of the walnuts combined with the tart, sour pickling brine acted in a similar fashion to a mustard and helped to elevate the beef to a new level.As we had a little of the Château Figeac left at the end of our main course, Chef Paul prepared a nice plate of cheeses to help us to finish off the bottle. What really made this a pleasure to eat was the accompaniments of apple with raisin purée and glazed grapes which were playful but matched the cheeses beautifully.And then came dessert...the second highlight of the night. The chocolate and peanut butter torte was lovely! Beautifully rich and unctuous yet also at the same time not cloying and heavy. But that was not the highlight. Smoked hay ice cream stole the show. I have enjoyed meats smoked in hay before but smoked hay ice cream is a new one for me and I was blown away by the creamy-smoky-can't-quite-put-your-finger-on-it-but-wow-that's-good complexity of the ice cream. Jerome had initially suggested a port with our dessert and I had gulped (I have long had a hatred of Banyuls being matched with chocolate!) but I must confess the port really did work. However, Jerome then produced another surprise by offering whiskey as a potential second accompaniment for our desserts. This was, in my book, the winner. The whiskey allowed the creaminess of the peanut butter and the smokiness of the hay to shine through the dish.We finished with a nice plate of petit fours - a lovely selection of macarons, gêlées and chocolate truffles.Whilst Rhubarb is still a young restaurant in a market that is stiff with competition and has to survive a very demanding yet fickle market, Rhubarb has been one of my best dining experiences in Singapore to date. In addition, the ambience of the restaurant (the right pairing of good food, great wine, relaxed, unstuffy and very accomodating service (I must mention that the restaurant very kindly increased the booking at the last moment to 5 people, without blinking!) combined to make a fantastic evening. My guests and I will definitely be returning

Went there for a wedding anniversary dinner. Lovely room with tables well spaced. Interesting brief wine list with well chosen choices at, I thought, reasonable prices (for Singapore). We chose the Menu which was 5 courses, three entrees, a main and dessert. The onion emulsion and the foie gras were the picks for me. Absolutely delightful. Finished off with a French whiskey. Service was excellent and a most enjoyable evening. We will be back

Rhubarb is the kind of restaurant that you suddenly think about a few days after - you're not sure if what you experienced was a dream or something you read off a novel.It's all too perfect, from the time you stepped through the door, the lush furnishings, the service and the food that's surprising and so delicious (the menu is straightforward). Save some space for the marvellous desserts.So if you want to dream a little, do go

Was there on a quiet weekday evening, service was alright, food was executed well with minimal glitches. However, we spent a total of 3 hours for the meal to be served from start to end which was not that pleasant. Average waiting time between courses was around 20min, and we got a bit impatient. Enjoyed the wine selection available
5
Was told that as a pigeon lover, this is the place to go. Way above my expectations. Fresh, juicy, and tender - cooked just perfectly with the "never tried anything like this" rhubarb sauce. The grapes with a glazed sesame shell were the perfect compliment to the pigeon.So happy to have taken the suggestion. Now I have another favorite place in Singapore. They were also particularly accommodating to my very annoying gluten and dairy sensitivities
5
Ditto the previous reviews. Prepare to be delighted. Sophisticated ambiance, flawless service, well thought out food with a touch of whimsy (I highly recommend the foie gras starter with rhubarb and the pigeon main with crunchy grapes.) Wine list very deep. We washed our meal down with a velvety Bordeaux recommended by the Maitre D' and had an excellent glass of port with the cheese. We will be back - and bring our friends
5
small number of covers, very good decor (渋い), and good acoustics so you can hold a civilized conversation.my oenophile friend was impressed with the wine list and we drank well at probably about the right price (3x retail).The food is imaginative, surprising, weird and excellent. No point trying to describe it. But it'll surprise you in a good way.The service was good. The obligatory androgynous cool waiter/ress, combined with francophone maitre d'... but we were fed on schedule with appropriate pacing between courses. The m.d. h. did a great job of navigating us, suggesting a pause for some cheese, suggesting the right digestif for dessert... all good, and particularly good in service-challenged Singapore.Not cheap, and not for dull business entertaining, but this is a real place, a real gourmet/gourmand restaurant that's trying hard. Watch this space.I for one will be back

Yes i am waxing lyrical in my tag line because this is one of the happier experiences of a true le restauranteur meal in singapore. From ambience to the worthy food, it was my second experience there because of a birthday treat was even better left to chef Paul Longsworth's worthy creation especially of a lobster very juicy because of how it met its death ; through pressure, so quick that it remained intact when cook-ready. Indeed, the best lobster we have ever tasted and we have tasted quite a few. Our 4 course meal was well presented and in just-enough portions (not ample). I like that Rhubarb's Gerome served us half bottles of french pauillac which is sensible after the champagne (and since some of us drive) and which complimented the elegant food agenda so nicely. Sitting at the chef's table so close to the kitchen was a touch noisy, but so were we and happily. A tour of the upstairs got me thinking of our office party at year end, and with cuisine this special and good, it is bound to make merry souls, merrier
