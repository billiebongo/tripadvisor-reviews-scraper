Attended an early reunion dinner with my relatives at Yan Ting this evening.First, I have to say that the environment of the restaurant is beautiful. Nice decorations and well lighted. The walkway is well orientated and tables are organized. Therefore giving a lot of room and privacy.Nice menu and a nine course to start.The Peking duck is a must try for all food lovers. This is one of their signature dishes.The meat was well marinated, allowing it to melt nicely in your mouth.The Dou Miao was also done nicely. Simple dish of greens but very well crafted with a touch of garlic.Apart from the food, I would like to highlight that there was a dedicated server that was working on our table.Her name is Karen and she was very attentive to our needs. She made sure that we had a great evening.Kudos to her impeccable service

Sunday is not the best day to dine here because the main Chef is off and the restaurant is short handed. We like this place because of its ambience and excellent service . The food is generally of high standard . Fortunate for us to get a room without a door and at the end of the dinner we were given complementary longevity buns with a candle for my granddaughter to sing her usual wishes.We had a wonderful time . The only dissatisfaction was the soup was lukewarm when served. The cost after Amex discount ($620)was reasonable given we had a full course dinner including a live soon hock fish and Peking duck and a bottle of Malbec wine. Corkage was waived for a bottle of champagne

Very good experience to dine here. Special mentioned to Jeanie, Kit Leng and Vivien for the excellent service.

Was here for a gathering and had an excellent experience with great food and ambience. Special mention to Jeanie, Kit Ling and Vivian for being so friendly and constantly looking out for us :)
5
Excellent service and friendly staff, special mention of Jeanie, Kitling and Vivien who are very responsive and always put on a smile.

My husband and I had a tasting menu which we truly enjoyed.The flavours and the presentation was lovely. The waitstaff was attentive. This was not our first time at Yan Ting & would say that they’re fairly consistent.
5
Accompanied my big boss and an important client for dinner. We were early had a couple of Tiger Beer in the lobby before we entered the Restraunt that starts at 6.30pm ! The servings were reasonable and individually served! Every dish tasted superb ! The soup was served in a claypot pot ! Very cute and unique and the temperature was perfect! The dishes and speed of serving was slow and for a moment I felt I was at a western fine dining ! I am sure it must have been expensive, unfortunately I cannot comment on the price! Service was excellent as well! At 6.30pm it was not crowded but later in the night close to 8.30pm it was almost packed. This is a weekday!

This is the second time I go this this restaurant after it's first opening a couple of years ago and it still disappoint!Was there for lunch and so obviously ordered Tim Sum and the food quality is certainly no where near to the other hotel restaurants nearby like Hua Ting@Orchard hotel or Shang Palace@Shangri-la hotel.Did not try their more expensive items in the menu but don't think I will regret
5
Yes, it is fine dining with all the frills but it’s the food that was outstanding. We started with shared barbecued pork with honey glaze, deep fried prawns with wasabi sauce and baby cabbage consommé with dried scallops. They were all rich with a mix of delicate and strong flavors such as wasabi and dried scallops. Our main course was the stir fried flat noodles with beef which was exceptional in its simplicity and balance of flavors of light xo sauce (we specifically asked to go easy on the sauce which worked very well with the thin flat rice noodles) and beef. For dessert, we shared the wonderfully fried light-as-air sesame seed balls and refreshing aloe Vera jelly. It was a very fine meal

Chinese fine dining with decent food. We had lunch here and I wasn’t wowed over. (Food at their French outfit downstairs is better).We had the Peking duck - this came first with the skin wrapped in crepes and then with the meat fried in a noodle dish (tasty). We ordered the usual dim sum - har gao, siew mai, char siew buns, radish cake, steamed rice rolls, egg tart. Also had the coconut dessert with almond milk which you should order early as it takes 20 minutes to steam. I would have liked if they had used a younger coconut so that the flesh was not so hard to scoop out.Overall pleasant. Decent food

Yan Ting serves Cantonese cuisine with a few other well-known Chinese dishes included. The dining room is beautifully appointed, and manages to feel intimate without the sense of being too close to other tables: quite an achievement. Our dim sum choices were excellent, as was the Peking Duck, and the Soon Hock fish with eggplant and mushrooms. The duck meat stir fried with noodles was excellent too. Service: everything one would expect from a five star hotel. The bill for four of us was very reasonable also. We'll be returning
5
There’s no family reunion dinner for my business partner and myself on this Winter Solstice. As it’s late, we decided to just have a simple dinner at Yan Ting. We were greeted and served by a friendly and knowledgeable server, Steven. He recommended a very tasty pan-fried steak which was impeccably well done. The portion was generous and meat was juicy and tender. Another well recommended dish was the live prawn in herbal Hua Tiao wine - a superbly fragrant dish cooked in Chinese wine and herbs. The pan fried bee hoon in seafood sauce was done perfectly blending crispy rice noodle with tasty sauce. What’s most welcoming was the dessert! It’s a serving of Tang Tuen (湯圓) in ginger soup. It’s definitely a sweet ending and provided a heartwarming memory of a traditional (冬至）reunion dinner. Our praises and thumb-ups to Steven who gave us attentive service and excellent recommendations for a delicious and heartwarming ‘reunion’ dinner at Yan Ting.
5
Not only were all of the food delicious, it was also very well executed and presented. We ordered a duck dish where the duck skin were rolled in a wrap (much like a mushu wrap dish). This was a great combination of a well balaned savory dish with contrasting textures. You have a choice of how your duck meat gets cooked (unlike traditional Peking duck where you wrap the meat in a bun). We opted for a lettuce stir fry and it was by far the best duck dish I've had! We also ordered a vegetable dish and you could tell how fresh the vegetable was and it was cooked to perfection. Lastly, the service was exceptional where our servers were very attentive and accommodating
5
We had dinner there on a relatively busy day in the restaurant. We were expecting a less than attentive service but boy the staff there did not provide anything subpar that night. In particular, a staff by the name of Louis was quick to details and attentive even in the busiest period. He ensured our orders was taken care of and saw us through the dining process impeccably. Definitely good enough to warrant this special shout out to him. The food as usual did not disappoint. An amazing experience.
4
Food: Some dishes were OK, we didn’t have any Wow moment. The duck was good but the duck wrap was a bit odd, too powdery. Service: Somewhere in between a regular Chinese restaurant and a hotel. Even in an English speaking country, the staff weren’t up to St. Regis standard. Overall I’d definitely come back, nothing bad to say about the restaurant. However, they definitely still can improve on quality of service and selections of dim sum.
4
Many restaurants nowadays offer good food but this place paired it well with great service. Close attention always but never in your face. More importantly it wasn't one of those noisy Chinese restaurants, so one could actually hear each other talk without all that background chatter etc
5
 We hosted our extended friend from overseas and everything was great. I’ve been here 3 times and Fibi never fail to make our experience a great one in Yan Ting. Thanks for the arrangement of a small Room as we need a quiet corner. We are small eaters but craving for more nice food and we like mostly everything which is printed in the menu. Fibi have also advises us to take less portion that is enough split to 4 guest and at the same time we can try more variety food. Thank you once again for everything and we will sure make a came back again soon
5
We had a great meal celebrating our 36th Wedding Anniversary at this luxuriously decorated Chinese restaurant. We had deep fried fish skin and fried brinjal with cereal for appetisers, pan-fried venison and roasted lamb shank with signature sauce, Peking duck, stir fried vegetables and noodles with duck meat. It was a sumptuous meal for the 2 of us. We especially like the ambience and excellent service of the staff.
4
Nice ambient with top notch service by Amy and Fibi. Which make you feel like home. Would recommed their special rice wine steam soon hock fish, fresh and yummy
5
We visited for our anniversary dinner whilst on holiday in Singapore. We chose from the menu starting with Peking duck. We had two mains, a veg and a fried rice and it was plenty of food. The food was really very good and the service provided was exceptional. Add to that the wow factor of the hotel and all in all it was a very special evening.
5
My family and I dine at Yan Ting on 8 Nov to celebrate our auntâ€™s birthday. The restaurant staff that attended to us was Karen Tan. Exceptional level of service from her and her team each and every time. She would always ensure that our requests and needs are taken care of. The best part is that she remembers our requests from previous visits! Food as amazing as always. Never fall short of expectation. Well done Yan Ting

My eldest sister chose this place for lunch on Nov 12 (Sunday) since her younger sister who came from Indonesia stayed in that hotel, and it would be much easier for her to get to the airport if we dined in the hotel. She ordered 3 kinds of dim sum- barbecue pork bun which was not too fattening, prawn dumpling and also jiu cai in Mandarin dumpling. We then had fish soup which was really tasty, Dou Miao with garlic was young and juicy,and two different types of pork dishes. The chef specially came to our table to greet us, and that was a surprise. There were also a lot of desserts, the variety of deep fried balls, though my eldest sister complained that the one with sesame in it is not properly cooked, and so the waiter or the manager took it away. I had half of the Aloe Vera jelly which was cooling and not too sweet, and also their hot almond tea cooked in egg white which was enough to fill my tummy
5
Been visiting for a couple of years and the food never disappoints. The service by Karen and May is top notch. Makes us feel at home every visit. Well done!Food to order:1. Scallion chicken 2. Fish maw soup3. Steam white radish with dates4. Wagyu beef cubes5. XO noodle
5
Most pleasant lunch at Yan Ting. Thanks to Chef Jimmy. Suckling pig was good as was the lobster with egg white. Tim sum was good. Although the skin on the cheong fun could be improved. Loved the aloe with lemongrass dessert. Will be back for sure!
5
Appetizer of suckling pig platter of roast and barbequed pork with jelly fish was succulent and crisp. But should have forgone the underwhelming century egg. Although freshly firm, I prefer a runny egg yolk. Dim sum was deftly handled. Mushroom truffle, encased within delicate skin, was a treat to eat and behold. Steaming hot Siew Mai, was crunchily pleasurable. Char siew buns had tasty filling and fluffy exterior. Lobster with egg white was delicious light egg with succulent lobster. Dou Miao with garlic was young and juicy. Textbook reference for how vegetable should be selected and served.Dessert of deep fried balls and Aloe Vera jelly featured the same light touch of much of my meal
5
My wife & I had a delightful and very satisfying lunch at Yan Ting Restaurant today (15/11) well composed and prepared by the Chinese Executive Chef (Jimmy Wong) whom we learnt he came on board 3 months ago having worked at Ritz Carlton - Beijing for 7 years.The photos attached are self-explanatory showing how well prepared and beautifully presented the dishes were (supposedly done with much passion!).We could taste the freshness & good quality of the ingredients in the dishes.Yan Ting will no doubt be one of our top favourite Chinese restaurants for dining
1
Overrated food . Taste is either too salty or bland. Service is not bad. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.
5
Great food n service. Ambience was very good. May, the waitress, was fantastic. She made the lunch extra wonderful.
4
This restaurant is upper scale, offering personalise table service, quality and delicious food, quiet ambience. Will come back again
4
Comfortable and usually calm restaurant. Great personalised service.Consistently good and delicious food
5
Earlier last month, I had a great dining experience with my wife in Yan Ting and we would really like to thank staff Fibi for the excellence services and letting us have a great experience at Yan Ting that evening. We would like to thank her for the food recommendations like stir fried pumpkin, lily bulb with yam, braise beef briskets claypot as well as the steam fish with olive. She also performed excellence service and patience when deshelling the crab for my wife ease of consuming. We will definitely show our continuous support for Yan Ting
4
The dishes are usually consistent -- well prepared and nicely presented.This is what we would expect in a restaurant in a 5-star hotel.Yan Ting decor is tastefully furbished and the table seating layout is rather well spaced out.Service staff is friendly and helpful and on our dining experience on 3 November (3/11) night, we were served by a cheerful/beaming Karen who was extremely helpful & attentive and knowledgeable about the entire menu
2
I made a trip down to Yan Ting for a family brunch expecting a complete experience in this restaurant that prides itself being the one of the best Dim Sum buffets in Singapore. The food takes about 1.5hrs to be served with only one piece of dim sum served to each guest, appetizers which were supposed to be served prior to the main dishes were served in an unreasonable small portion after the main dishes were served. We attempted to order a second portion of appetizer after immediately after the first portion was served but was told that it was the already the last order of the buffet, to my dismay there was no notice from the kitchen or staff if we would like to have additional portions prior to the last order. Should we have known that the portion of the food were so small and takes such a long time to be served we would have ordered more from the start.Scallops were overcooked and presentation of the food was really bad, the only consolation about dining in this place was that the floor staff were pretty polite and the manager attempted to make our experience slightly better by attending to us
5
My family and I dine often at Yan Ting. The food is top notch and service is always excellent! Quality dishes and great ambience. Manager Sally is very friendly and highly professional
5
i have been dining in Yan Ting last week .The dim sum was outstanding!other dishes like Black garlic soup serve in Tea pot ,fish with chinese wine ,roast pork ............Service is good too and efficient even though the place is Busy.their staff will always try their best to make our dining experience a great one especially their service staff KAREN!Never once our tea cup was left empty ,she make us feel comfortable ,karen is provide very good service and good khowledge recommend food for us.For sure will come back here to visit agian
5
Food here was extremely tasty, and felt very home cooked for us. Price is on the high side, but you definitely get the quality and service. We had the chilli prawns, pork ribs, scallops with corn and their claypot soup. Everything was perfect, except for the scallops with corn which I felt was quite alright ( despite it being their signature ). It doesn't seem to go too well with the scallop, but the scallop is fresh and relatively big and tasty.The desserts - charcoal tarts and the green tea pancake are delish! I wish they gave more portions :PIt really deserve the michelin star, and we will definitely come back again for more
5
The food is excellent and the service is Tip Top too.... would recommend this restaurant to my friends.
5
We had Really good food n service in private room . All dishes were delicious n Creative .We enjoyed very much n will come back for more soon . Thank you
5
Excellent service and great food, thanks Yan Ting, planning my wedding dinner hope can be done here

This review is getting a good rating overall due largely to its ambience. Excellent ambience in a classy setting. Love it! However, food was really average. Sorry, I donâ€™t recall any particular dish that we ordered which was spectacular. In fact, very pedestrian. We had sautÃ©ed shrimp with macadamia nuts ($26), roasted duck ($24) baked barbecue pork and pineapple bun ($7), scallop rice flour rolls ($10) prawn rolls with avocado ($9) and steamed dumplings with abalone ($9). Service was generally attentive except the captain forgot my initial order of the scallop rice flour rolls and we had to wait longer than expected.
3
Went once for lunch. Service is good (not excellent though for the price). Atmosphere is excellent. The food presentation is excellent. But the price. The most expensive dim sum I've had in my life. The taste? I won't say it's worth the price
5
We had our family dinner in August and were impressed by the excellent services and signature dishes are delicious. We were served by Aibi who is so friendly and introduce nice dishes to us! Thank you Aibi and hope to see you again:)
5
Great food with amazing signature dishes. Duck rolls were divine and the fish in celery wine sauce was amazing. We didn't dine in the main room so hard to gauge the ambience but passing through it seems vibrant and lively as one would expect.Service was good and I'd definitely dine there again
2
maybe for those who went for the brunch was wowed by it, for me, my dinner was nothing specialI m sad to say any other reputable hawker/coffee-shop stall in singapore can easily match what I have over at Yan Ting, this really yank me hardThis is no wonder some commented (e.g. Natasha),places like jade, palace in forum or imperial treasure in great world city/paragon can do wonders instea
3
Nice decor & quiet ambience in the main dining area despite being full. Fish maw soup & peking duck were good. However the soon hock in xo soup sauce was not that tasty, a little bland. Oxtail with red wine sauce was a little out of the usual chinese fine dining menu. Foei gras should be seared a bit more to get the crispy outer crust instead of just soft texture, this was quite a let down. But overall okay dining experience in a nice finer ambience. However for tastier chinese food, i'd still go to jade palace in forum or imperial treasure in great world city/paragon
5
We have a lots of fun during the Brunch in Augâ€™17. The warm and efficient services from the Yan Ting team is super. We feel very comfortable not only the ambience fantastic also the staff are always attentive and caring. This group is marvellous, well trained and polite. Will visit them again. Once again, let us thanks Miss Sally Chan and her staff for the wonderful time
5
Write to express our sincere thanks to all the Staff of Yan Ting lead by Ms Sally Chan, the Manager, for their fantastic services. We enjoyed our dinner very very much. It's a memorable night. Many thanks to Amy, Fibi, Karen and Yan Thien for their great effort and services. They are all lovely, polite and efficient. Thumbs up. Million likes. Will definitely visit again
5

Thanks to Sally and the lady server ( forgot her name) .. Will recommend this restaurant to my friend.. I had great evening..
5
Very nice Food especially the fish head & the geo duck , staff were very attentive, will definitely visit again.
5
Having our brunch this afternoon at Yan Ting. Food served piping hot and service from the staff is execellent. Certainly will strongly recommend this restaurant
5
Kit Leng, Jeannie and Awin - 6 stars service. Efficient, patient, courteous, friendly and professional. Compliments to the Chef and team for a very delicious lunch.
4
We were greeted upon arrival and Jeannie led us to our table. I realized the table behind me were given wet towels before eating but we were not. The diners beside me arrived about 30 mins after us. Doesn't the hotel has a standard operating procedures in place? Why the double standards?Awin and See Min have been excellent. Please explain.

Review in point form to better articulate my frustration.1. Wait staff was not attentive, I had to spend an average of 5 to 10 minutes each time to catch their attention.2. Food came super super slow, I usually finish my meal in under 1 hour, this time I took almost 2 hours to complete my meal.3. Food portions especially the char siu sou has shrunk tremendously, gave feedback but waitress said that the size has always been the same. This is not true as I have dine here many times before. Complain again to another waiter, he said he will feedback. This shows that wait staff is not consistent and will give any answer to brush the customer away.4. My favourite frog dish was unavailable, too bad5. The noodles dish I ordered came to my table in a very small portion, I asked the waiter why has their portions shrunk so much? He took 10 minutes to investigate and came back informing me that the chef gave me 1/2 portion instead of full portion. Waiter even put the blame on me for chasing them which resulted in the kitchen being confused.6. Restaurant manager acts more like a school discipline mistress instead of a restaurant manager.7. My overall experience was really bad, and if this is the standard now, I am truly sad to have 1 less place to eat dim sum in the future.PS: You may have read my previous positive review. Sad to say my favorite waitress who always made the dining experience super pleasant at Yan Ting wasn't around that day (it would be a pity if she had resigned)
2
We visited this place for my bff's birthday. We choose this place because it was recommended as one of the places for dim sum. It was a disappointing brunch date. We went for the brunch buffet on weekends. For the price we paid, we would have expected better quality for the food. Most of the food lacked flavour. The only thing that made us smile, they prepared a small cake for my friend. Actually, i informed them that it was my friend's birthday.
4
This is a classy place to dine and a good place for family dinner or celebration. Service is not consistent. On a busy day you need to give and take. Food too isn't consistent. If you want good quality stay away on Sunday. Reason? I think the king Chef is off. It is a expensive fine Cantonese cuisine.. Live seafood is great but so is their lamb signature. Claypot selection is good too. But we never miss out on their Peking duck . Study the ala cartel menu on line before you dine there. Save you a lot of time and not making mistakes which will cost you dearly. However if money is no object you will be pampered and you will love this place.we had a great time especially when my granddaughter sang the happy birthday song in two languages. What a joy which money cannot buy
5
We had reservations for dinner at Yan Ting on a Saturday night. We were shown to a table for two that seemed like a booth because curtains were hanging on either side. We were given a generous pour of a late harvest sauvignon blanc that was quite delicious with the trio pancake Peking duck. We let the chef choose the vegetables, and he chose sauteed spinach leaves which were quite fresh but next time we would choose Hong Kong kailan. The price was reasonable with the discount for Starwood Rewards members. The servers were clearly very professional and personable. We recommend Yan Ting for an outstanding a la carte dinner experience
5
Atmosphere was great. Food was good, my favourite was the liu sha bao. I suggest to go for the ala carte if you are not a big eater. All the staff were friendly! My friend and I had exceptional service from Calvin and Steven, they made our dining experience a pleasurable one
5
Came with friends for a nice brunch.First time being here and left a very good impression be it the food and the services.I would highly recommended people around the world to at least try once!You're highly attended to ,plate was changed without any request, the waiter and waitress are very friendly.They always put on a great SMILE.You can feel that they are proud of the role and company.Keep up the good service
5
Came here with friends, and the food is delicious and service is attentive and great. Will recommend to other friends!
5
Had a great lunch with my friends here. The service was great as the host always comes around and make sure we have sufficient order. Tea was at constant refill without any prompting. The food was amazing! Will definitely come back again. Love
5
The food here is excellent with polite and well-trained staff. As usual, I had my lunch with my family and the food never fails to disappoint me.
4
This borders on a gourmet experience, the kitchen produces extremely refined food both in taste and presentation. The front of house staff however are not quite as polished and the service was a little too "family-style". Surprisingly for this level of restaurant the waiters were having trouble with English. I was told later that they'd had an unusually busy lunch service compounded by unplanned staff shortages so perhaps they'd conscripted a couple of gardeners and pool cleaners to make up the numbers! I guess we can cut them some slack.So definitely come here to enjoy an excellent meal, just be relaxed about the speed and accuracy of service and you will have a good time
5
Was there with my family last wednesday. It was a very pleasant experience as the restuarant staff there are really helpful and nice. Special mention to Josh for helping us with the menu recommendations and ensuring that it will be a great dining experience for my family that night. Thank You
5
The dim sum is really yummy. Karen, who is the captain there, was especially attentive to our needs, plus she is friendly too :) Two thumbs up. Keep up the good work
4
Warm and friendly cantonese service and really great food with a vast variety of options to choose from. We had the chrysanthemum apple jelly and mango pomelo for dessert which was really refreshing. Goose web was very refine with great sauce
5
The restaurant is inside St. Regis hotel.I love dim sum and we were here for dinner. A lovely experience!We had several of our favourites and they were delicious. I opted for the typical dim sum dumplings which I found great. My husband had a meat dish however I canâ€™t recall what it was. Dessert was also great, the dining room gorgeous and the food magnificent.In all we were amazed with the high quality and outstanding service
4
I have gone to the restaurant a few times for dim sum lunch. You can select either a la carte menu, set menu or brunch men. They are good and prices are reasonable being a Chinese restaurant in a 5-star hotel. There are two seating for Saturday and Sunday, 10.30am to 12.30pm and 1-3pm. I usually go for the second seating as it is not so rushing
5
Really a treat to dine in such lovely and elegant ambience(however not over-powering) with refined and tasty Cantonese cuisine . My wife & I ordered just three dishes and bowl of race each : Seared Scallop with fried corn in teriyaki sauce which was succulent but the fried corn was really just few miserable tiny pieces considering it's very inexpensive ! Second dish was the Braised Sea Cucumber with Yunnam Ham and that was blowing us away with it sensational texture and heavenly taste !!!Last dish was the humble Mixed Veggie and Vermicelli in Clay Pot which turned to be exceptionally tasty (I could literary polish off my dinner with just this dish with a bowl of rice , haha) . After that there was no room for dessert .The prices are rather steep to reflect the status of a premier restaurant but thanks to Amex special it didn't cost us an arm and a leg . Worthwhile indulge for occasions 
5
We had a family gathering dinner on 9 July 2017. All of my members were very impressed with the outstanding service and excellent quality of food. Special thanks are extended to the restaurant's serving crew Ms Karen assigned to our dinning group. She was very knowlegable on the menu and wine lists and was able to provide advice / suggestions according to our needs. On top of that she also offer special help to take care our young children guests as well as senior guest. Thank you Yan Ting and Karen. Keep up the good job. We will see you in our next dinner function. From Kim Lo
5
Is a not cheap pricing of menu, food is good , a simple daily soup of the day also can cook until very nice.Service team very attentive and observant providing us a high standard service .Worth the money that we paid , keep up and will back 
5
First impression is impressive with the first contact with Calvin. Showing us to the table for 3 of us. Loves the ambience and the soothing music so much. Service was outstanding. Will be back
5
I was here with couple of friends for dinner and was amazed by the quality of food and service . The ambience was perfectly beautiful and with soothing music .We were serve by both Calvin & May . Both were helpful and courteous. Ms Sally Chan the manager in charge was impeccable in her service and explained all the dishes in detail . She really made my dining experience a pleasant one . Will definitely be back :
5
Today I celebrated my mother 90 birthday lunch at Yan ting restaurant.The staff serving us were Louise and See Min and they were very attentive and patient in taking care of my mother. We ordered live prawn vermicelli and they peeled all the prawn for my mother and cut the mee Sua In very short strands for my mother on their own initiative without our request.Thank you for making the day, my mother enjoyed the food and the service very much.We will recommend more friends to come
5
 strongly recommend their crab with vermicelli! The staff provides good service as well. The food takes a little time though, but good food is worth the wait!
4
We had the vermicelli crab, oxtail stew and asparagus! Great service by Fibi and the attentive and courteous team! Keep it up! :

I was pleasantly surprised when I was given a private section of the restaurant for my reservation for 16 pax although I did not request for it.The food were delicious. The pan-seared goose liver were done just right and left a lingering taste which makes me crave for more. The crispy suckling pig had such crispy skin with just the right amount of meat underneath. The double-boiled baby cabbage consomme was clear and tasty to my liking. I usually prefer to have salmon eaten raw but the baked salmon with black truffle in teriyaki sauce had the right mix of fish and the fragrant truffle mix which makes me enjoy the cooked salmon.Although we were all quite full when we added an order of seafood fried rice with lobster, we finished it pretty quickly because it was simply so delicious.I also like the aloe vera jelly dessert served in the Signature set menu which adds a refreshing finish to the dinner.The most memorable and impressive during the dinner is the excellent service of See Min. She was very polite and friendly throughout the evening while tending to the different needs and requests of my guests. When there was a delay in the dishes served at the kids' table as well as some items at the adults' table, she makes it a point to apologise for the situation promptly and explains clearly the reason for the delay in the dishes being served.She was also able to understand the my needs and considerations and made good recommendations when I wanted to add order.My guests and I were delighted at her service and unanimously felt that she has done a wonderful job
5
Food & service was excellent as a captain recommend the dishes, fantastic. Highly recommended!!!!

Been to Yan Ting for lunch several times. Although there'll be shortage of manpower occasionally , the staffs still try their best to be attended whenever is needed / called. Thank to josh , the assistant manager , whenever he is around , he always makes the lunch enjoyable with his sense of humours . I am a soup lover and found the daily soup there is consistently good and tasted . Excellent ambience for business lunch 
5

Yan Ting is the Chinese restaurant in St Regis and as expected the ambience is posh. The food is delicious and quite affordable. Service is friendly overall but a certain Karen has been very helpful and sincere in making recommendations from the many dishes available. Will certainly return

This review is a follow up to my dinner visit to Yanting Restaurant in St Regis Hotel Singapore. I have become a regular dinner guest at this fine restaurant with its thoughtful impeccable service and wanted to try their lunch service when I had some overseas guests. At the suggestion of the charming manager we had groupa fish broth followed by an assortment of dim sums and special green vegetables imported from Cameron Highlands. The fish broth was rich and fish was as fresh as it can be. Dim sum were very refined and of high quality. Most importantly my guests were very pleased with the lunch
5
My friend recommend to have dim sum lunch at St Regis Yan Ying, this is my visit but my friend is the regular there,the dim sum is really very fresh and the service staff is very friendly,especially the kit was very attractive, my brother cough she bring the serviett immediately,we will definitely come back for this restaurant again

Had lunch with my friends at Yan Ting recently. Food was good as usual but service by the Captain Ms Fibi was First Class and Top Notch. She was attentive and personal and took impeccable care of all of us throughout the meal. Definitely going back again sometime soon

Had a very satisfying meal!! Ordered a few dishes and they were Super delicious! The staff were very polite and friendly too :) will definitely visit again! Service rendered by Calvin & Fibi was excellent . They are friendly and super efficient .Thank you so much for the wonderful dinner 
5
The staffs were very patient and attentive to our needs. The food were also very delicious and will definitely come back to visit again. Definitely deserve many praises!
5
Had appetiser all the way to dessert. Food deserves a 4/5 but the service and attention to detail makes the dinning experience 5/5. Great place to be pampered
5
Peking duck is excellent as always ,unfortunately the lobster noodle was overdone. But with the prompt attention of one of the service staff it was rectified immediately! Pleased with the service and will definitely be back . Kudos to the restaurant manager
5
The Restaurant provided excellent food and customer service. I will like to comment on the great food recommendation by the staff, especially the fish roe egg white fried rice. Will recommend my friends to visit.
5
The service is excellent with short waiting time for the the delicious dishes to be served.The price is reasonable.Looking forward to revisit YanTing and would like to thanks Josh, Bruce, Calvin and the rest of the YanTing team for making the dinning experience a great one.Keep up the good vibes
5
Compliments to the Chef and team - the xo lobster mee pok, dim sum espcially truffle mushroom dumplings and desserts are all so delicious. 6 stars service from Steven, Bruce, Jeannie, Derrick and Josh. lovely ambience too
5
The meal was amazing and waitress was helpful explaining & giving advice regarding various dishes. Food is not cheap but highly recommended, Pork Korubuta, Ginger onion with yellow crab & Black garlic soup served with tea pot
5
Standard of service n food have been consistent. Staff are friendly n possess good knowledge of the menu. They are well trained by their team leader, Ms Sally Chan

Reserved a table to celebrate my mom's birthday at Yan ting, but the experience was disappointing to say the least.Our orders were forgotten, which had us waiting a full 30 mins between dishes before anything else was served. Alas, we had to even remind the staff that nothing was on our table.Towards the end, the restaurant even charged us for dishes (which we ordered but never arrived).In summary, a non eventful experience for a place known for its service. We would have had a much better birthday celebration for my Mom elsewhere
5
We received excellent service from Karen at Yan Ting restaurant at St Regis Hotel she recommended very good dishes from the menu enjoyed our meal which was one of the best we had ever had I highly recommend the restaurant because of the excellent service and delicious food
5
My friend invited me to Yan Ting for dinner. It was a great dining experience where you can totally trust the serving staff and on duty manager for their recommendation. Thank you Miss Amy for recommending some signature dishes and I love Braised Oxtail with Redwine served in Claypot, Bamboo Clam steamed with garlic and green bean vermicelli & Cantonese Style Beef Tenderloin the most. Appreciate that Amy who recommends us for the Glutinous Rice Dumpling with Goose Liver and smoked duck, and Glutinous rice dumpling with abalone and lotus seeds, very delicious, thumbs up!Thank you for such wonderful dining experience
5
The seasonal menu that's served in this Chinese restaurant is indeed impressive .the serving staff knew the menu well and could recommend signature dishes to us.we love the oxtail Claypot very much.we enjoy the food and their service. Keeping topping up our tea cup and changing our plates.TOP servicesGals Tks fibi you are so unpretentious and helpful.will comeback for you.❤
5
Wanted a not so heavy meal, I was recommended to try a very tasty bowl of fish and rice noodle in wine based soup with a delicious dish of meatball with green vegetable. Thumbs-up to Yan Ting's service crew, namely Kit Ling, Awin and Steven who were all attentive and friendly, and most importantly willing to recommend dishes. Apart from good food, their impeccable service had provided me with a heartwarming dining experience .
5
Celebrated my Uncle's birthday here. The service provided was second to none. Very attentive and made the whole dinner very memorable. Was blown away by the suckling pig, and all the other dishes were fantastic. Although I did not ask if they have a policy of sustainable seafood, all the seafood in the menu were from sustainable sources
5
I had a wonderful dinner at St Regis Singapore Yan Ting restaurant on the 21st May 2017. What impresses me was not just the great food served but more importantly the service of the staff there in particular, Karen. She was very meticulous and friendly and I would certainly like to comment her here for her great hospitality
3
I visited Yan Ting with high recommendation from a friend. During my 4D3N stay at the hotel, I visited Yan Ting twice - once for dinner, and once for its Sunday dim sum brunch.On both occasions, the food is very good and luxurious. However, the quality isn't exceptional enough for the hefty price tag.The service was spotty. The servers were politely impatient, if that makes sense to you. Though efficient, service was very rushed... and that made me felt uncomfortable, not to mention sort of unwelcomed.I'd recommend for anyone to go to either Wan Hao at Marriott or Shisen Hanten at Mandarin Orchard for a better overall experience if you're looking a Chinese restaurant in town.
5
Food here is extremely delicious! Service is good too especially with Calvin, Amy, Karen and May! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Definitely worth the visit!
5
Customer service was excellent especially the male manager Mr Josh who is very attentive and patient to all my request 
1
Not worth the visit. Food quality poor especially the Peking Duck- Please don't order it. It's one of the worst Peking Duck I have tasted. The scallops and foie gras dish looked that the scallops have been halved and pathetic. Waiter more interested in talking cock at tables than serving. Not worth the visit at this price and even with 20% discount. Definitely can get better food at Hua Ting, Crystal Jade, Jade Palace, Imperial Treasure
5
One of the best Chinese restaurants in town !!! Best dinner I have eaten so far and the service staff are soooo polite ! My fravouite 2 dish is the miso cod fish and kurobuta pork chop! Thank you !
5
I've been to Yan Ting several times before, and the quality of food has never disappointed. This time, I brought my mother (for an early mother's day meal) and was amazed by the selection available during the Dim Sum buffet. On the on set it does seem a bit pricey for a lunch, but if you're out to impress or simply keen on a meal experience like no other, then this is the place to be
4
Awesome place & all the staffs are friendly and helpful. The foods is very nice, all in all --- MUST TRY. Highly recommended!
5
came here for dinner. Excellent food - a bit expensive but expected for being a hotel restaurant. Service was good. A wide diverse menu selection. The only thing I didn't like was the 18$ charge for a bottle of tsing tsao !!! The decor is more of a fusion decor, not traditional chinese albeit very classy and nice. Avoid ordering alcohol here. Otherwise good place for chinese food
5
Chinese food at the finest. Every dish was a spot on. Amazing flavours. Immaculate service. The staff attentive to us. Highly recommended! A must visit in Singapor
5
The foods are delicious and most important the staff services are excellent and very attentive! This is a good place for business and entertainment
5
The food is good as well as the thoughtful and warm services received from the team of staff at Yan Ting. Here would like to express our thanks to Amy, Ya Thien, Karen and Fibi for making our lunch a beautiful one. Not forgetting to thanks the beautiful, courteous and lovely Sally, the manager, for everything. Indeed we enjoyed very much. Looking forward to see you all soon. All the best
5
Have been to quite a number of restaurants but still find Yan Ting's services among the tip tops. Needs to convey a sincere message to the manager, Sally, - you are great. The food standard maintains as the services too. Thanks to the ladies like Karen, Fibi, Amy and Ya Thien. Lastly also thanks to those who did not serve us as whenever they pass by, a sweet smile appear on their faces
5
It's long time since our last visit. Everything is fabulous.The great services by the staff of Yan Ting is excellent. Thanks to Fibi, Ya Thien and Karen. The lamb and the roasted duck recommended by Amy is good and delicious. Thanks Amy. Would like to express our sincere thanks to the Manager,Sally Chan, who is always attentive, polite and caring
5
I had the pleasure of dining at Yan Ting on the 7th of May, and was lucky to have been served by Karen. She was able to make good recommendations as she paid close attention to our requests. Apart from that, she checked on us periodically to make sure that we were enjoying her picks, and took care of our needs (tea refills, change of plates etc.) in an appropriate time frame. Thanks for the exceptional service, Karen! I do hope to have the opportunity to experience your exceptional service again, when I next visit Yan Ting
5
We came in for an early Mother's Day dinner. My mom enjoyed her time. Josh and Karen together with the whole team did a great job! We will definitely be back.
5
I'm from Hong Kong and I know my Cantonese food. In my opinion, Yan Ting is one of the best Cantonese restaurants in Singapore. They serve creative and exquisite dimsum, fresh and perfectly cooked seafood specialities like steamed crab in egg white and wine, fresh garoupa, and abalone. The decor is elegant and understated. Phoebe provides attentive and non-intrusive service. A real gem
5
i had the luck to be served by Bruce at Yan Ting during my sunday weekend brunch with my family of 9. he was extremely attentive and paid attention to everyone's requests and even had the initiative to aid my aunts in removing the lobster shells. his personal touch to our every request really allow us to feel at home and comfortable during the entire dining experience. big thank you to bruce
5
Trip adviser Yan tin serves an excellent selection of Cantonese and Teo chew delights. I was most impressed with the customer service from Mr Josh who went out of his way to make the right recommendations and arranged for my order to be served in my room. The food was well done,beautifully presented and the personal touch of the staff Yan tin was most appreciated. Was so good, ordered again next day. Thank you Josh for a great culinary experience!
5
I had a very enjoyable dinner with my friend s. The service is very good and the food was very tasty and nice
5
Great food and service (especially Sally and her team) ! One of our family's favorite Chinese restaurant in Singapore!
5
this is the best chinese taste singapore can offer for me after living 3 years in this country. i am not actively looking for different cantonese restaurants because i wouldn't taste the difference even if they could offer something better. i haven't regreted any single one of my orders even comparing to ones in Hong Kong or Taipei
5
1st class service from Jeannie, Kit Leng and Steven. Compliments to the Chef and team for the delicious food. Thank you

Dinner at Yan Ting St. Regis Hotel, Singapore28 April 2017Celebrated my aunt's 80th birthday!Special set menu of Alaskan Crab.Changed the perch for Peking duck.Good meal.The crispy yam roll was good and I don't even like yam.Soup was good and the piece of breast chicken meat was surprisingly tender.Switched sea perch for Peking duck.The flat green vermicelli was more like a glass kway teow but there was hardly any Alaskan crab roe - very nice.Dessert - jelly was so so but the custard pastry was soooooo gooooood.
5

Yan Ting has very good food and also good service.The value for money is also excellent.If you go there, there will be available tables for sure, even during peak hours.Its service and food taste is also consistent and they won't change the menu without prior notice
5

5
The food and ambience at Yan Ting is definitely one of the best in Singapore. But what makes this place truly special is the level of service at the restaurant. Friendly yet not imposing. Attentive but not over eager. Great place to bring family and good friends

Worth repeating visits the Yan Ting restaurant. Helpful and warm staff n experience in dinning is awesome

4
Very good ambience with attentive service.Food is also nice.Recommended to try if you are in Singapore
5
Yan Ting at St Regis has been my wife and my comfort place for meals for many years. It's a place that we come regularly with confidence knowing that we would have a quality lunch or dinner.We liked the ambience, the varieties and authenticity of Cantonese cuisine, and the friendly service of its staff, special mention of Karen, who has been diligent and attentive. She took time to understand our requirements and remembered our preferences; it was one of the reasons of drawing us back regularly.We enjoyed our dining experience there and came out satisfied patrons
5
Our family dine out a couple of times a week. Yan Ting is one of our favourite Chinese food. We love the suckling pig, morel egg plant, black garlic conch soup etc were super! The service is excellent and all the staff are friendly and professional . We would always book our table with Karen Tan who is always attentive and helpful and plan our menu well.
5
I visited Yan Ting last Friday with my family in the afternoon for lunch. I was extremely satisfied with the served that was provided to my family and me. I mentioned to them about the special diets that my parents had and she manage to give a number of recommendations to me. Also, as my boy of 3 years old is giving me problem when having the meal, I couldn't actually enjoy my lunch properly. I was very surprised that the staff there actually took the extra mile to help me in managing my kid so that I can enjoy the session in Yan Ting. Overall, the food was delicious and fresh, staffs are friendly and also the ambience was just nice for a family lunch. I would highly recommend to my friends and family to visit Yan Ting for an meal and that experience the excellence service provided by the team
5
Just had a delightful dinner at this fine dining Chinese restaurant. Service was attentive and thoughtful. Restaurant ambience was generally good and welcoming. We had sea cucumber with maca soup strongly recommended by restaurant manager and we were pleased with the delicate Flavours of the herb maca which originates from Yunnan China . The star grouper was steamed just right! Kudos to the Chef . My friends were very impressed and enjoyed the dining experience very much
3
Quality: decentService: attentive Price: reasonable Highlight: cheong fun has crispy fritter dough inside, adding a crunchy texture
4
Cantonese restaurant in a luxury hotel. The standard is there, but food is not particularly out of the ordinary. Suitable for meals with the family
5
Was attended by staff named Kit Ling. She is very thoughtful and attentive when we mentioned to her about our dietary requirement and allergies. She also recommend us what we could have enjoyed and checked with kitchen to see if we can consume safely. Always carry that sweet smile of yours and keep up the good work
5
Extensive menu, excellent food, warm and friendly service. One of Singapore's best Chinese restaurants
4
This was the first time that I have eaten here. I came with a friend for lunch using the AMEX platinum card. The ambience was cozy and noise level acceptable. We were seated quickly. We ordered the salted egg prawns and beef with asparagus for mains and black fungus for appetizer. The beef was tender and tasty. The prawns were big and juicy with crispy almond flakes. Overall, the quality of the food was good. The minus point was car park charges can be expensive and you need to spent more $100 t0 get free car park
4
Friend buy me belated birthday dinner at yan ting.Have not din there except for wedding banquet.Once seated feel really warm and relax as though we have being there regularly that's how the staff make us feel. Talking to them realise they really love their job and most staff have work several years.Food was good, we had soup of the day really good, deep fried perch fillet in spicy mango sauce ($26)was recommended chef's signature pan fried chicken with morel in superior soy sauce ($48)was good but a bit too much for two person. Baked salmon with black truffle ($24)very good and leaf lettuce ($20)very well done.Each dish bring out the chef skill.Over heard a conversation they had with a regular elderly couple requesting for a table towards cny eve.I think yan ting is full but the staff was very acommodating told the couple if you dont mind we can set a small table in a corner for you but please cannot complain. The couple look like wealthy couple was too happy to accept. This is great gentle loving service, I was so impressed.Before writing this review went through other review realise the F&B manager was responding to most review that's hard work.Good job all at Yan Ting. Keep it up business will prosperous

After a most disappointing experience at La Brezza on Christmas Day, 2016, we returned to St. Regis with much trepidations. This time, we went to check out Yan Ting and left happily with super full tummies.I called to reserve a table and was told there were two dimsum sessions: 10.30am to 12.30pm, and 12.30pm to 2.30pm. Being early risers, we booked a table for two for the former.We were greeted by every staff and shown to a cosy corner. The decor was grand and beautiful. We chose the SGD108++ per person dimsum buffet andJosh ordered the signature dishes for us.It turned out that these dishes were superb! Each dish was delicious and the amount of food was just nice, so that we had room for more. Every staff was attentive and courteous, we could not have been happier.I will let the photos do the talking, needless to say, we are gonna be back very very soon! The whole experience from entrance to exit was fantastic
4
It's our first time to Yan Ting and we were impressed by the quality of the dim sum, roast meat platter and yellow fish dish. Siew mai came with mini abalone on top!!! and most of the dumplings have the right skin thickness vs filling ratio. I like the truffle mushroom dumpling but didn't really like the pumpkin dumpling. The steam fish dish (forgot name, item in photo) is Super fresh. Our yusheng is also very yummy. I had 2-3 servings. Restaurant environment is luxurious, upscale and tastefully done. It's a place to go if you want a nice ambiance and good food and you are willing to fork out a bit for it. We spend about $100/pax and would recommend this place for more special occasions but I'm not sure if I will come back just to eat dim sum as it might be too expensive.
4
Went there for Chinese New Year lunch in private dining room.Service was Top class, very attentive. They were filling the tea pots literally every few minutes to make sure it's hot.Set lunch was good, but taste wise I found it average and a bit bland.Appetisers of Crispy pork, Oyesters and Chicken was delicious and so was Abalone. We skipped dessert.Must try
5
I can certainly recommend this restaurant for gourmet Chinese. The food is delicate, succulent and beautifully presented. We had suckling pig - beautiful crackling and juicy meat - just perfect!!Jellyfish, beef tongue, Pork in black bean ( this is a must have dish - soft and succulent) and lobster fried rice with xo sauce. It is not a cheap meal but on the other hand it is not as expensive as one would expect (being a part of the St Regis). It's a formal restaurant. Their dim sum lunch on a Sunday is also really good.
2
Expectations were high as the private party was to be at St Regis and dinner was from Yan Ting. Food was acceptable but the service was poor, couple with very very very noisy neighbours in adjoining private rooms. Expected also better signage for the various parties held there in order that patrons go to the correct dinner event
5
We are very pleased with our dining experience at Yan Ting. The wonderful food from preparation to presentation are always perfectly served by their attentive staff, namely Karen, May and Kit, who are assets to the restaurant.Thank you
5
Amazing food. Service was outstanding, especially Louis. Great place for celebration. Thank you for an unforgettable experience!
5
We had a great dim sum dining experience in St Regs Yan Ting.The food was great, especially the prawns. Most importantly, we enjoyed the service rendered by Mr Louis Phan. Service was prompt, fast and warm, simply immaculate.We will come back again
5
 We wondered which good chinese restaurant for our friend to try out who is first time in Singapore, Well, Yan Ting in St. Regis was definitely an answer. As soon as we stepped in the restaurant two gentleman welcomed us with warmth and smile the assistant manager named JOSH sat us, immediately offered us the menu with full of confidence. That's why we decided to entrust him in taking care of our menu. Having the first dish was immediately , Wow! Simplicity yet our taste buds was very happy! Dish by dish was served which made our dinner perfectly right! We would also like to commend Two of their other staff ( unfortunately didn't able to get their names) they are constantly checking our table if everything is alright. GOOD SERVICE as I like!Highly recommend restaurant ! Definitely will come back and bring more friends and family! :) Sorry didn't able to take photo of two of the other dish!
5
Great service! I brought along my cranky 1 month old daughter and the service staff were so friendly and made me and my wife feel at ease even with a crying baby. They offered to provide hot water to heat up the milk even though we did not ask. Food is good too
4
3 friends come for medley of unusual dimsum, and some dishes of the day - perch poached in wine, choice kailan. Very good attentive service, well priced food and classy dining ambience
5
I went to Yan Ting on 27 October 2016 to host a welcome lunch for my Shanghai guests who were first time visit to Singapore (and their first meal in Singapore). We were all impressed with the restaurant ambience & foods quality, especially the " Tea Pot Soup" and " Cod fish" . this would be the best cod fish i ever had. And the Lamb Chop dish is a "Must Try" which i believe is one of their signature dish. But the Lamb Chop portion is too big for me, it would be just nice if sharing by 2 persons :). Beside that, i must say that the waiter / waitress are very attentive & efficiency especially during peak hour time.... Thank you so much !! Our overall experience here were flawless, great value ! I will certainly be returning.
5
Great service by staff kit ling. she was attentive to our needs and gave us great food recommendations. We are very satisfied with her service. Thank you
5
Visited the restaurant on a friend's recommendation and I have to say I was blown away at how personable and sincere the service staff was. Nothing seems to be too much trouble for the staff. My party initially chose a pu-erh tea but decided to change to a more fancy herbal concoction and the staff insisted I try two different types to see which one I preferred. Food wise, the dimsum served was elegant and every morsel was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I will be back here in a heartbeat, and never felt such excellent service and exceptional dimsum in a Chinese restaurant in many of the cities I visit either for business or pleasure. Yan ting will be one of the places I will definitely highly recommend for any occasion.
1
This was my second visit to the restaurant. I had a great lunch experience with my colleauges previously and and thus decided to bring my family there. The restaurant was much crowed this time as it was a Saturday. The disappointment started when the egg tarts was first served. We were shocked to find that it was so cold and bland. The quality is even worse than those they sell food courts. Throughout lunch no one came over to replenish nor top up our tea, which was not the case previously. When the last dish of wasabi prawns arrived, it turned out to be salted yolk prawns. After checking, the waiter confirmed the chef made a mistake and told us they will get it rectified immediately . We then sat there whilst all the waiters were walking around without paying any attention to us. After waiting close to 30 minutes and still no sight of prawns, we called out to same waiter and her shocked response was " they haven't serve you ? " . She then hurried into the kitchen to remind the chef. We were finally served after another 10 minutes of waiting. I am really puzzled why we have to wait so long especially since they have made the mistake in the first place. Shouldn't the chef prfioritize and prepare for us first ?We were completely disgusted by the poor service and food from such a reputable restaurant
4
Truly fine dinning for Chinese food in a hotel, but when the waiter got our orders, he did not repeat them for us. So they kind of make mistake. Food are nice. Service is nice too.
4
Tried the Dim Sum Weekend Brunch - expensive but worth it as it has lobster, abalone, prawns - all the expensive stuff.Very nice setting, fancy but comfortable and cosy.Service - friendly, attentive, what you would expect in a 5-star restaurant.Must tries - mini egg tarts, lobster, the abalone soup, deep fried soon hock, congee, etc. etc. etc - too many to mention.Yummy
4
Booked dinner for my families (incl in-laws) and initially told we need to split to 2 tables for the 12 of us. Surprised, Yan Ting placed us around a big table in a private room. Had a pleasant family ala carte dinner time. Service staff (Jerwis) recommended a couple of dishes that were not in menu. We were very satisfied with his recommendations except the fried rice with Peking-duck meat, which was too dry and bland. Our highly recommended dishes - rack of lamb in chef signature sauce, pan-seared scallops in corn and Teriyaki sauce, deep fried prawn in salted egg yolk, poached seasonal greens w/fresh lily bulbs and wolfberries, Peking duck in trio coloured pancake wrap. Unfortunately, ran out of bamboo clams and fresh prawns. Desserts like double-boiled papaya w/ snow fungus n almond, double-boiled sea coconut, double-boiled Hashima were very good
5
The Cantonese food here is great , I love their Long Jing prawn and their Long Jing tea the most. Coupled with champagne , though it is one of the pricier weekend brunch, you pay for what you get. Service is prompt and attentive .
5
Yan Ting is a Chinese restaurant that serve exquisite Chinese food. Great for fine-dining. Try the tasting menu and you will get 5 different dishes in tasting portions, perfect for the foodie! The waiters were super lovely and totally felt that there was room for jokes, they guy who served us was lovely, still remember his friendly smile
5
we made reservation with Yan ting,St Regis for my boyfriend's birthday celebration. The gastronomic experience was truly beyond my expectations. Especially Josh made us feel very welcomed. We Had an enjoyable night. Please convey the appreciation message to Mr Josh.I Would recommend this restaurant for any occasion for its professionalism staffs and the atmosphere.This is a place to return to for sure
4
This is a fine dining Cantonese restaurant located at the St Regis Hotel.The place is beautifully decorated and full service is available as you walked into the restaurant. Kept clean and tidy.Had formal dinner with relatives which we had a few dishes (roast duck, stir fried chicken, ox tail and crispy noodle) and ended with desserts (I had sago and mango dessert). All the food are cooked and presented at the fine dining standards. All food served tastes good to me.Staffs service are good with attention to refilling of teapots and empty glasses. The staffs always attend to requests of dividing some dishes to small bowls when required. Normally asks before removing empty dishes.The overall experience is good in this restaurant
5
It is a simple dinner and also a gathering for my Friend and her fiancÃ© to congratulate their marriage. We tried quite a lot of dishes. Thank you Ms. Amy The assistant manager for recommending the dish - beef tenderloin with black pepper which my Ang moh Friend loves it very much and of course we all love the dishes we order. Every dish we order is just perfect and delicious. All of us love the services, food and desserts. Thank you Chef Kai for preparing such delicious food for us!! Thumbs up!!We will definitely come back to Yan Ting again
5
Went for a family dinner back in July. Wait staffs were very attentive and professional. Had my niece who is 2 years of age and everything was well taken care of. Kudos to Amy Chin ( floor manager at that moment) for taking good care of us. Would recommend this restaurant for any occasion for its professionalism wait staffs and the atmosphere
5
Excellent service, good food and ambience. Value for money.Will come back again. Especially Kit Ling and Josh made us feel very welcomed. Had an enjoyable night
5
They served the most wonderful dishes, all very rich in taste and refined. I highly recommend this restaurant when you want to eat the best duck in Singapore. Very chic in a prestigious hotel and the mooncakes they had were fantastic

We lunched at Yan Ting on 3rd July with a guest who like and is member of St RegisWe had har gow(prawn dumpling) and scallop dumpling as the first 2 dishes and there was a sour taste in the filling of both items and the prawns inside were hard.As we had only 1 piece of each for each diner, we could not send any back to the kitchen.The hargow was tiny and would be eaten in 1 small mouth, so it was too late when I tasted the sourness of the item, as it was on the way down my throat.I also forced myself to swallow the bad scallop dumpling as I had chewed on it and it would seem rude to spit out in front of our guest.The other 3 pieces were eaten with chili dip so my dining companions could not confirm my suspicion that the items had gone bad or made with expired ingredients.I however did highlight this to the staff to check with the kitchen.I did not get any response. Subsequently my guest liked more hargow so we ordered another serving.This time my husband tried it without chilli dip, he confirmed it was sour. We sent the 3rd piece back to the kitchen.Meanwhile we had to ask for change of plates(which should be offered as standard service instead)At one point,my hubby had no plate to eat with for at least 10mins and we had to ask for a plate twice. We were almost wanting to reach for one ourselves from the counter.Service was way below 5* standard and no apology was offered for the bad food either.Guests could have avoided being served bad food that day if they had taken action on my feedback.Luckily my young kids did not consume the items that had gone bad as their young stomach would not be able to tolerate.I feedback to the general email of St Regis(as i could not find any specific email to restaurant or F&B nor GM).Yan Ting manager responded a day after but she did not accord a compensation I felt was more appropriate.Subsequently the F&B executive emailed me with the same offer to go back to visit which I have rejected and tried calling me only once which I missed the call.It has been slightly more than a month, I have not heard from anyone since.I did not see the need to return the call with the same compensation offered.We are disappointed with the initial non response of staff, feeling slighted and ignored.We are again disappointed with the response, damage control do not seem keen.I have not been served sour or bad tim sum in my whole life, much less from a reputable hotel establishment

Went to Yan Ting recently for lunch. Pleasant enough space. But it seemed that chairs of neighboring tables were set too closely together. The restaurant was not crowded, but we were given a table with a view of used plates n cutlery. Please see the view from our table. Strange. Food. You must choose carefully. Some were very good, like the Macau Roast Pork. Others were unfortunate choices; for example the salted egg prawns. The prawns looked very nice but had almost no flavour. Just salty. Service was ok. Nothing particularly good nor bad.Overall, we had expected more from a St Regis restaurant and have to say that we were somewhat disappointed

We had a family celebration and ordered the Decadent Set. The suckling pig was magical - not fatty at all. Th fish maw soup delicious. Every course was extremely well executed. Service was highly attentive but not intrusive. Additionally we had the fried Mee Swa which was exceptional. This is a place to return to for sure

The food was very average chinese. It was disappointing being in Asia eating food of this quallity in what is otherwise a 5 star....albeit old 5 star hotel. But then it is much like Singapore....Asia without the Asia
5
Beautiful restaurant in the St Regis Singapore. We enjoyed the set menu dim sum for $55++ and then ordered some extras from the al la carte menu. Delicious. Highly recommended
4
My family and I had our dinner at Yan Ting a few days back. Food was of quality but taste could still be improve. Apart from food, I got to say that the service is impeccable! Every staff was attentive and very polite to my family and I. However, would be good if the staff checked with us before the clear the dishes and there were two instances that they cleared before we could finish. The dinner ended with a delight surprise - A lighted cake was presented to me and I was taken aback as there was no mention that I was celebrating my birthday. Very nice of Yan Ting and the service team for this small gesture! Thumbs up
5
The lunch dim sum was unique and delicious with great service from Karen Tan! Karen provided great recommendations and prompt service in a beautiful dinner area. Their signature mushroom Bao was a real treat for the eyes and the stomach. Be sure to book in advance as it can get hectic on the weekend.
3
I had a 7-course meal which is an overwhelming amount of food for one person. I arrived at a good time at around 7 pm which left me enough time to enjoy and pace my meal. While the menu is usually changing, I can remember that the set that was served was unusual to my palette yet pleasing if you're one to enjoy Cantonese cuisine. I would suggest this set meal / 7-course sets to families or groups who aren't in a rush to finish their meal
5
Dine here for the very first time this month and it was the most memorable experience ever. Service staff was excellent and everything was perfect. Culinary was fantastic. Expensive but you pay for the experience
5
In Singapore one is spoiled for choice when it comes to Pan Asian food, especially Chinese. You can get solid Chinese tasty food with very little cost involved at most food courts and food centers everywhere. ...But what about when you want a great Chinese meal and fancy a treat as well?That is where Yan Ting comes into the equation because they serve excellent Chinese food, quality ingredients and high end cooking in a 5 star environment within the St Regis Hotel, with service to match! Need I say more?OK I will - one more thing. In Singapore service is generally efficient but here it is also charming and friendly as well. Very well done guys, will recommend to friends and family looking for a treat in Singapore.I have attached pictures of the dishes we had with comments. Cheer

Ambience is lovely with a modern touch. Service is impeccable, and we would really like to compliment Karen and Sally for their excellent service :) Food is great too and we highly recommend the miso codfish.
4
Quiet and relaxed atmosphere. Food was good, but the Peking duck was excellent. Friendly and helpful staff made for a very pleasant dining experience.
5
Super kind and friendly staff. Great quality of dim sum and other Chinese selection. Convenient location. We come here every week!
3
The dim sum here, while meticulously prepared, somehow tasted unremarkable. Service was pleasant and professional, as was the ambience which borders on being opulent. Prices here are above average. But somehow the dim sum while good, was not memorable. They have done everything right for an upscale restaurant like Yan Ting but more work needs to be done to give their food that "X-factor"
3
We tried our best to have the waitstaff offer suggestions from the menu. Failed. There must be some favorites and specialty dishes, but our servers were noncommittal. We were left to randomly pick dishes and some were hits and some were misses. Overall the food was good, but wish the waitstaff was able to do more than take an order
5
I, my wife and son, plus four family members recently experienced the Dim Sum Buffet at this restaurant. You are given an extensive menu from which you can chose any dish, however many times, including a range of appetisers and desserts. Each time you order the dishes are then prepared and brought to the table.We were given an alcove to one side of the restaurant, which was quiet and very comfortable. One thing was immediately apparent-the service we were going to receive would be very professional, unobtrusive and efficient. And so it proved.The menu is extensive and should suit all tastes, from lobster, seafood, meats and pure dim sum dishes, too many to list here. If there was one dish amongst so many that we had that was disappointing, then I missed it.There are 3 set prices for this meal, each price depending on the drinks package you order. The first is the basic SS108++ for food and unlimited soft drinks, The second is SS149++, same as the first but includes unlimited beer, and the third is SS169++ with the addition of champagne. We all had the first package. Value for money? Absolutely. So much so that my son is treating us again before we return to the UK.The buffet is only available at the weekends. Each mealtime consists of two sittings: 1030-1230 and 1300-1500. Go for the early sitting, particularly for the best roast pork you are likely to find anywhere
5
Happen to come by for dinner and am certainly overwhelm by the service and food! Flavoursome and very well done! Love the privacy of this restaurant!
5
Great seating arrangement, very comfortable for 2 persons. Great food, great plating and great atmosphere. Definitely one of the best Chinese cuisines, just look at the pictures.Slightly on the expensive side
4
This place does great food with excellent service. Have the staff recommend you their menu and be delighted with the fare they present
3
Had one meal here as we were hungry and did not want to wait. Food served quickly and efficiently. Waitress parceled up Peking Duck in pancake for you: have not seen this done before.
5
This is one of the places with great service and excellent dim sum ! The food is second to none and considering Singapore has problems with getting service staff, this is a place where the team tries hard to impress 
4
In all there were 10 of us making it easier to try a wide variety of dishesThe food, decor and service were first class Obviously prices were at the higher end of the scale but well worth itOverall a very enjoyable lunc

Lavish Set MenuAppetisers:Roasted chicken with garlic (breast meat tender)Deep fried prawn coated with salted egg yolk - piping hot, very goodMarinated jellyfish with scallion oil - niceDouble boiled sea whelk consommÃ© with black garlic served in teapot - love love this, always goodBraised supreme sea cucumber with corn - Nice taste but I wish it could melt in the mouth/ the other set changed to braised 5-headed South African abalone with sliced pork and mushrooms - the piece of abalone is tenderBraised scallops and luffa (green vegetable) with lobster broth that has some dried scallop in it - goodPan-fried Kurobuta pork with black pepper sauce, comes with thinly sliced lotus root, celery, peas, yellow & green peppers, carrot and mushrooms - tender porkFragrant homemade almond tea with egg white - nice, almond taste is not too strong which is good; crispy red bean and banana fritter - goodExtra dessert - Hollow glutinous rice ball coated with white sesame seeds - piping hot, nice even though I don't normally like glutinous rice.Weak cold chrysanthemum tea but the waitress happily changed it to a stronger oneService is good, friendly and attentive

I had visited Yanting a couple of times and this was one of the best dinners I've had. The pan-fried Kurobuta pork chop practically melted in my mouth - I certainly would order again - and among other great dishes. I was there for a get-together with friends and comfortably seated by Yanting's Miss Fibi and her smile was so infectious, she made me smile even more. Like any busy weekend dinner crowds, I could tell that the serving team was working hard and the dishes were well paced out - that showed genuine attention. There was devotion to great culinary skills and poised service. Truly commendable. Thanks to all at Yanting, and of course, I left the restaurant after a great dinner, greeted by Miss Fibi at the door and her smiles were the best lasting "dessert" ever. Keep up the great work! Special mention - the Lobsters are another must-try
3
We came here for dinner and ordered crab and corn chowder, stir fried beans, lamp chop and pork loin for two persons. Nothing spectacular at five stars prices. I would not opt to come back here for dinner. For business travelers who are staying at the St Regis and too tired to explore with big expense account then this is one option.
4
another restaurant worthy of its reputation, with impeccable service too.the fish was cooked to perfection, hate it when other places oversteam the fishthe stand out dish was the kung pao prawn, most places do a faux szechuan version which may veer towards the cloyingly sweet, but the skill of the chef was evident here in the wok breath and the flavourful oomph.Uni fried rice was another bright spot, elevating the usual seafood fried rice with the sweetness of urchin (a little goes a long way)nice setting, mostly hotel guest crowd for sunday dinnerTIP : check for SPG member discount off your bill!!
3
This place serves actually quite decent food but the service level of the manager and the speed of food is atrocious. We arrived at 12.30pm for lunch and was only able to leave at 2.30pm. All we ordered was an appetiser, soup, a fish, the kurubuta pork, lobster noodles and dessert. Will not come back again as this is not the service standard of a restaurant in St Regis Hotel
4
This is very much haute cuisine Chinese cooking. We had a set menu, which included a wide range of well-executed dishes - some not so Asian including sautéed foie gras, It was low on carbohydrates (none of the courses had any rice or noodle content) and so whilst it was all very tasty we left feeling rather hungry.Nice atmosphere, although it felt very much a hotel restaurant
5
Steamed grouper with rice, Peking duck, Pork, pan seared Goose liver, prawn and lamb. All superbe! In my experience this restaurant is the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore
4
This was the first in 2 meals at St Regis over a weekend.Let me start by saying this is an extremely expensive restaurant; don't expect to pay less than S$100.However, I was trying this restaurant out with a friend for the dim sum buffet (S$108 per person) and for this, I think it was pretty good value.The huge advantage with Yan Ting, is that when you order dim sum, you get to choose how many dim sum arrive --- you can order one piece, 5 pieces, or however many you want. This is really great so if there are only two of you, you don't have to have 4 pieces of dim sum, you can order 2 pieces. Also, this is all cooked to order, so don't wait until you finish before you order your next portion well before! It can 10 minutes before the next one arrives.Nearly everything is really good. The only thing I wouldn't order again is "Barbecued Pork with Honey Glaze, Roasted Duck, Soya Sauce Chicken, Crispy Roast Pork" (all served as one dish). Mostly seemed a bit dry ---- but the Crispy Roast Pork was excellent!!!
4
We came for their Dimsum, so our first item was their Crispy BBQ Pork Buns (SGD$6.00 for 3) - there were 5 of us and we ordered 3 to start. We liked it enough to order another set of these crispy pork buns with crusty skin that melted in the mouth; the honeyed BBQ pork were tender and sweet, filling up these crusty shells deliciously.Moving on, we had Meat Dumplings with Abalone (SGD$9.00 for 3), or better known as "Siew Mai". The abalone was steamed soft and tender, very easy to bite - even the mom approves. The shrimp within the dumpling was very fresh and bouncy, however I did not like the meat. Instead of the usual minced meat, the meat in the siew mai here seemed to be in pieces, and were hard, with a distinctive porky taste that was not pleasant in my opinion. Generally, Its nice plac
2
The envoirnment is not bad, but the food standard is really cannot make it, does not worth the price. The quality standard is very low, i think the chef need to do more improvement., none of the items is nice, even a hawker stall food is better than what Yan Ting is serving. Service is quite good, staff is friendly.overall very disappointed, not worth for money, if the food still dont improve, i will not visit again, although i am the Supper Club Member...
2
Was here for dim sum with family. The food is run-of-the-mill with hardly any presentation. There was no art to the food, like it was roughly chopped & just sent off to the guests.Tried to innovate with foie gras deep-fried spring roll but everything was fried & couldn't taste foie gras at all.Our bill came up to a bit & all we had was simple fare; it's not like we had steam fish or anything.The dining experience, with the service and seats, cutlery and tea was good tho. In fact, I liked the tea best out of the whole lunch. Good ambience too.One thing I must add, I felt thirsty after the lunch tho I drank so much tea. Let's hope it's not MSG

While looking for a special place to celebrate a milestone birthday for a family member, we went through many websites and menus and I admittedly hesitated before choosing Yan Ting as the menu sounded rather simplistic for what seemed to be a not too simple price. But we decided to give it a try. The verdict: this is a fantastic restaurant which came up tops in every way possible. The food - which we now realize is very understated on their menu was perfectly cooked, simple, fresh and with decent sized portions. This is a nice change to many fine dining restaurants which jazz up their menu with very lengthy, superfluous descriptions of their dishes, only to have their food appear in tiny portions and condiments that cannot be seen or tasted. We had one of their set dinners, and the lobster, fish and pork chop needs a special mention as it was two thumbs up.Service throughout the dinner was of the highest standard possible - courteous, attentive and somehow extremely inconspicuous but they would appear without delay once they sense that you need something. Everything was done with a smile, and a gentle elegance that is extremely rare.The ambiance is classy, quiet and regal. Beautiful set up - a place that is suitable for that special meal with the family or with business associates. The price sounds rather daunting at the beginning when you look at the menu, but upon completion of the meal, the amount spent is actually worth your while and I would not hesitate to return.If there is a slight improvement that Yan Ting can make - it would be the service staff that handles the phone calls. There is a slight mismatch of the tone and level of service standard over there and an improvement there would have really sealed the deal for anyone calling in to make a reservation straight away.Overall though, this was an experience that was memorable and thank you Yan Ting for a great meal and for making the milestone birthday a wonderful one

I had lunch with a friend at Yan Ting on 16 May 2015. After looking through the menu, we decided to go for Dim Sum Set Lunch because we felt that it will allow us to try out as many dishes as our stomachs could handle. We were glad that we chose that because the portions were just right and our stomachs felt very satisfied.You can taste the freshness in ingredients of each dish. The fried items were not oily. The way the dishes were served is very nice and chic. The décor is very classy and the ambience was great for 2 friends to sit down, eat and chit chat. We took our time to eat our meal and did not felt any rush to complete our meal. I understand that they have rooms to accommodate if your dinning is large (i.e. more than 4).The service staff are very efficient and friendly. Our dishes were served timely. I would certainly go back again and highly recommend to other people
5
Have not visited this restaurant for years until my friend invited me for lunch last month. The variety of dim sum is tempting. The claypot Fishmaw soup is fantastic good. The staff is well mannered. Need not worry about little issues like topping up of ice water, changing plates and teabags as they are well taken care of. This restaurant keeps to its standard. I have been to many Chinese Restaurants but none could do better than Yan Ting. Thousand LIKES for Sally, Karen, Fibi and Amy..
5
It's ambiance is good. The dishes are good too especially the Lobster Noodles which are sweet, fresh and crunchy. The staff who serves us is likeable, lovely and courteous. A nice place to dine and relax. Thanks to Amy, Karen, Louis, Sally and Ya Thien
5
The food is good as well as the Staff. Was honoured to be served by Ms Sally Chan, the manager on our very first visit as we have not been there for awhile. And Ms Amy Chin, the Assistant Manager on the fourth visit even though the restaurant was rather full at that moment. Their service and recommendations are excellent. This sort of service is hard to come by. Will visit them again
3
This is my second time here for the dim sum brunch. The 1st time was years ago when Yan Ting just opened. Now I know why I did not go back again. The dim sum was really average. No wow factor. The service was good. Not worth the price. There are better dim sum restaurant within 10 minutes drive from Yan Ting

Yan Ting Restaurant serves Chinese fine dining cuisine strongly inspired by the authentic Ming Dynasty, when authentic Chinese culinary art flourished. They have an exquisite menu specially designed and crafted by their new Executive Chinese Chef, Tony Wun. It was Easter Sunday but the restaurant was packed with diners.The interior decor was all gilt and mirrors, with some frosted glass panels and fine paintings adorning the walls. There was nothing short of a touch of class and sophistication with the drapes and muted but tasteful tones of the restaurant.We came for their Dimsum, so our first item was their Crispy BBQ Pork Buns (SGD$6.00 for 3) - there were 5 of us and we ordered 3 to start. We liked it enough to order another set of these crispy pork buns with crusty skin that melted in the mouth; the honeyed BBQ pork were tender and sweet, filling up these crusty shells deliciously.Moving on, we had Meat Dumplings with Abalone (SGD$9.00 for 3), or better known as "Siew Mai". The abalone was steamed soft and tender, very easy to bite - even the mom approves. The shrimp within the dumpling was very fresh and bouncy, however I did not like the meat. Instead of the usual minced meat, the meat in the siew mai here seemed to be in pieces, and were hard, with a distinctive porky taste that was not pleasant in my opinion.The next item another remarkable favorite of mine - the Goose Liver Spring Rolls (SGD$14.00 for 3) - crackling on the exterior and scrumptious on the inside. If you love foie gras, this is just the thing for you - goose liver amongst slivers of vegetables, perfectly paired in texture and flavours.Finally, the one item we managed to squeeze space in our abdomens for - Red Bean Cakes (SGD$8.00 for 3), or known as "3-layers cakes" as recommended by the service crew. The first layer is Osmanthus, then Coconut in the middle, sitting atop Red Bean which is the bottommost layer - the cooling and refreshing dessert was utterly endearing. They were not too sweet, adding just the right touch of soothe to the palate after an engaging savoury meal (yes, the dimsum managed to engage the senses overall).For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/lunch-at-yan-ting-restaurant-st-regis.htm

Love the food here - Louie Wu as our attendant was exceptional. Subtle yet attentive, he is a gem of a service talent. Thumbs up to you guys for the amazing food, wine, and service personnel :)Will definitely recommend this place to friend
5
Been here many times with the family and relatives on birthdays and Chinese New Year dinners. Its best to order a set menu as you get a filling meal with very reasonable portions for each course, and at quite a reasonable price ($150+ per person) for their extraordinary dishes. I highly recommend the pork chop with black pepper sauce. The pork is just so tender and simply melts in your mouth. Makes me hungry thinking about it.... The ambiance in this place is first class with the place thoughtfully decorated . The private rooms enhanced the dining experience for a big group like us as we were able to make ourselves at home and have a joyful family gathering. Service was decent as expected every time I went. The only complaint I could make about this place is that the presentation is not good enough to match the flavors. It's not really significant as I forgot all about it after getting the food in my mouth

I, my sister and her husband went for Sunday dimsum set lunch this weekend during our stay at St Regis. The food was decent, although service was average. The first few dishes came very fast but we had a long wait halfway thru the meal.As expected from a 5 star establishment, it wasn't cheap
5
More than just a Dimsum Buffet. It offers a wide selection of the best chinese food plus dimsum. The weekend buffet offers a half a lobster and abalone soup per adult. The Truffle Siomai, Hakaw, Steamed Soon Hok, Prawns with Salted Egg and Seafood Flat Noodle were among our favorites.The pricing is on the higher range but worth it especially for a small group of diners who wants to try lots of variety.
5
Today 17/2, we had pre CNY lunch to celebrate a good year. We were greeted with a lovely smile at the reception and was brought to our table. Me and wife were pleasantly surprised that even during such busy times (CNY), the managers n staff at Yan Ting are full of smiles and delivered great service!
5
Excellent customer service, variety of dim sum and foods. Great environment. Will definitely recommend people to try their weekend brunch. Worth every penny! "Two thumbs up
5
I was invited by a friend to have lunch at Yan Ting today, he ordered my favorite fish maw soup and braised abalone! The lunch was heavenly and the abalone was cooked to perfection. The staff at Yan Ting were polite, friendly and very attentive, constantly changing the cutlery and check if our tea was getting cold, and I was most touched and surprised that they even noticed that I am left handed and placed the cutlery accordingly. I am impressed that they are so attentive to the guests, even when the restaurant was crowded. I will definitely be back soon with friends and family. Thanks

Went for Dim Sum brunch on recommendation by a friend for Mom's Birthday. Service was wonderful right from the start. I'm with a party of 6 adults and a baby , and staffs were so accommodating to provide assistance for my sister with her new born daughter. Amy Chin, the Asst. Manager that afternoon was a blessing. She recommended dim sums which were just nice for party of 6 and we've thoroughly enjoyed it. She had also made preparations by delivering a surprise birthday cake for my Mom when she knew that we were celebrating my Mom's birthday that afternoon. My mom thoroughly enjoyed the dessert esp the honeycomb cakes and also the surprise birthday cake! I would recommend Yan Ting for special occasions as they truly put in care and thought into serving their patrons!
2
Won't be returning to this restaurant - of course food tasted good while I was eating it. It was laden with MSG. Completely got MSG reaction that lasted for two hours. I order the barbecue duck, fish congee... Right after eating the fish congee, I started feeling funny. My head was all clogged up. A bit nausea. If I wanted MSG laden food, I would go to the hawkers market. Not a five star hotel. Bad

Birthday celebration for father-in-law @ Yan Ting on a weekend dim sum brunch. Ordered a decent amount of food including mains (lamb rack, which was recommended by a friend and very good; and roast pork with crispy skin which was OK - the skin was crackling and a tad salty but the meat itself was quite dry), dim sum (egg custard buns, mini chicken pies, deep fried prawn, char siew buns, two types of chee cheong fun or rice noodle rolls), fried rice and fried vermicilli.The dim sum and fried rice was quite a let down especially at the kind of prices we paid (mini bite-size chicken pies were $8 for three pieces, fried rice at $28 etc) and I probably could get much better at some of the local joints. You might say the point of eating at a higher-end hotel is the ambience, which was quite good, but service was also average (maybe trying to be "discreet" but the servers were standing a good distance off throughout our meal and we had to "self service" for pouring tea and spend time getting their attention for refill of sauces, etc)Total damage was about SGD$60/head, not something I would come back for as there is far better dim sum elsewhere at a good ambience.Probably good only if you want to impress a business counterpart who is a relative newbie to Asian food and want a more discreet / not too crowded setting to talk shop
3
This place is strictly for special occasions. Grand ambiance here with good service. Food i.e. dim sum, however is not up to par with the ambiance. Wouldn't rate it anywhere close to being the best dim sum; in fact, some dishes comes across as blend. You are literally paying for the ambiance and service only
2
The food was not up to my expectation in a great hotel as St. Regis. The service was good, but the quality of food made the overall experience not a memorable one.
3
Let me start with the good thing first. Food was awesome, quality of ingredient was fantastic. The seafood was very very very fresh, so that's good. The soup with fish maw was out of this world.But....We were there for the 2nd seating on a Sunday, and towards the last hour (around 2PM), we noticed that it took them very long to have the food ready (not all tables were occupied actually), so it was a tad let down, we had to ask for follow-up a couple of times. And we were waited by somebody who was was not friendly (I ate at Jade few times and their service is AMAZING, even East Ocean has better service in my humble opinion) and not patient whenever we called him to order (I didn't manage to see his name tag). He insisted that one of our order had come out while it had not, so it was uncomfortable for us. Unfortunately
5
The Service the quality of food is worth every penny!Enjoyable needless to state sumptuous variety of dim sums.
1
Let me start by saying that I have eaten here three times so this is not just a one off experience. The dim sum here is really nothing special and the selection is minimal at best. I think they are trying to make themselves out to be something different but honestly I would prefer that they stick to what most customers want which is Cantonese cuisine. Try it for yourself and see if you agree with me. Do yourself a favor if you are staying in the hotel and try one of the many other places Singapore has to offer
4
I went to this restaurant almost everytime I stayed at St Regis Singapore. My family loves the food there too. The weekend Dim Sum is quite satisfying. Waitresses are friendly, especially if you can speak Chinese. You will never go wrong either with the a la carte menu. The fish maw soup was unexpectedly enjoyable
5
Although the price is a bit costly but it worth a penny since the food here is great, fresh, clean and great service by Ms Amy Chin. Thank you my supplier for bringing me on this nice dim sum (^o^). I will definitely back for more
4
We ate in a private room with a group of 12. Food and service were quite good. We will return! Fresh vegetables, artistic presentation, unobtrusive service.
5
This is haute cuisine, Chinese style. Authentic yet prepared so carefully that every nuance of the dish comes through. Highly recommend the lobster in egg white and white wine sauce
5
I had a vary enjoyable dinner with my auntie. The service was good and the food was vary testy and nice.
4
Service standards continue to be stellar, which is a showcase of the way the manager runs the place. Nothing is too difficult for the service staff, who are always on the go. What disappoints me, however, is despite the publicity of a new executive chef with michelin stars hailing from Hong Kong/Macau, that the quality of food has definitely dropped. During my two recent occasions there, with business associates (and having requested for a private room), the food standards have been inconsistent, with some previously aced dishes to an abysmally mediocre standard. While presentation is good, if it looks good but doesn't tastes the same, it's not worth eating. Please bring back the previous standards in the kitchen to warrant for the prices you are charging

I dined at Yanting on 30th April evening with some business associates . The service was friendly , efficient & prompt . However I was disappointed with the food quality & its execution . One dish that was particularly disappointing was steamed frog's leg with black fungus . The black fungus smelled & tasted Mouldy & sauce was overpowering . I didn't expect a simple dish that was so poorly done esp fr a restaurant that has a Michelin starred chef . The mix vegetable pot was bland & tasteless like a pot of vegetables soaked in brine. The saving grace was the impeccable service & good wine list. The wine sommelier was v knowledgeable & helpful .Special mention must be given to the alert & attentive restaurant manager. We were in a business discussion but was disrupted by a child who was running loose in e restaurant . She saw that we were disturbed so she ushered us to a small private room for 3 of us. Despite disappointment fr the food , we enjoyed the evening spending more than $700 on wines

Great to dine at Yan Ting .Cozy and warm ambiance, friendly staff welcomed and very attentive , tasty food .Only a little disappointed that the char siew bun we order at 1pm ,end out were told sold out at about 30 min later :((However still a good impression with the dining service. Well don

First time to Yan Ting, and we were very impressed with the food, service (great young waiter who was very attentative) and the restaurant is decorated beautifully.We were travelling with our 9 year old daughter so we also had to accommodate for her taste as well which was no problem.Yan Ting has now scored a spot on our regular restaurant list on our return trips to SingaporeSee you again soon!!!!!!!

Yan Ting has came up a few times in our search for the best dim sum in Singapore. We arrived at the restaurant and were lucky to get a table without a reservation. It seemed like the restaurant is really popular on weekends. It could be due to their dim sum brunch promotion which has two seatings. The restaurant is decorated in understated elegance and the ambience was really good - minus the occasional loud mouth customers sitting nearby. We ordered the usual suspects - Char Siew Rice Rolls, Steamed Pork Ribs, Har Gao, Siew Mai with Black Truffle, Carrot Cake, Chicken Feet and Pig's Trotters in Vinegar. I must say the taste and quality of food is really one of the best we have had. The Har Gao was stuffed full of prawns and not the frozen ones, mind you. The Siew Mai with Black Truffle were some of the best I have had. But I must say the black truffle tasted more like minced black mushroom. Couldn't taste the fragrance of truffle. For someone who doesn't like and never tasted chicken feet, I decided to give a try this time. The chicken feet was surprisingly tender and succulent. The gelatinous texture tells me it must be good for my skin cos that's collagen! I can live with this!The disappointments though, have to be the carrot cake and the steamed pork ribs. The carrot cake was too mushy. It lacks taste and texture. The steamed pork ribs on the other hand tasted funny. Maybe frozen pork not thawed well? The price of eating in a luxury hotel is of course not cheap. But if you compare the average pricing vs quality for dim sum in Singapore, Yan Ting is still affordable and gives good value. We will be back

Food was worst than Cze Char. Duck was hard n cold n salty plus sweet. Portion was tiny. 70 plus tables were squashed in the ballroom under bright light. It felt like a canteen cum communal wedding. The blasting of a singer at the tiny stage felt like "GER TAI" for the 7th month Ghost festival. For $1288plus plus and renders such lowly services from a 6 star hotel is truly unbelievable n disgusting. plus we were hosting stable of overseas guests. it was embarrassing!!

Food was very good with fine, delicate flavors. Served individually tapa style in a very eye-pleasing presentation.

The Yan Ting is very nicely decorated.It has very luxurious details and ornaments on everything at the restaurant. The dessert takeaway has an average average but has a very aromatic smell

Planned a Birthday dinner for my girlfriend at the restaurant, made a reservation via their website indicating that I was bringing her there for a celebration. Food was excellent, service was very prompt and professional. And at the end of our set dinner, I believe the manager brought a slice of cheese cake with a small candle and a big sparkler. There was also a Happy Birthday deco on the cake. My girlfriend and I did not expect this at all. Appreciate the kind thoughts and complementary cake. Will be back for more Chinese food

We found this restaurent by accident . What a pleasant surprise . Tucked at the end of a hallway on floor 1U at the Ste Regis, Yan Ting is elegantly appointed.I prefer vegetarian when I travel and they had a special vegetarian selection on the menu. How different than the steamed tasteless veggies that most restaurants use as a vegetarian alternative.We chose really exotic things like mushroom and fungus in a veggie broth.Yum. Sweet and sour veggie chicken was delicious as was the Cantonese noodles .My wife had impeccably prepared lobster soup and lobster out of the shell for her main course.The service was excellent.We have travelled the world and we agreed that this was our best Chinese meal ever

I was invited to have lunch at this top class restaurant known for the Cantonese cuisine.Having lived for a while in Hong Kong, I can confirm they can provide the best dim sum I've ever had.I'm looking forward to be back on my next visit to Singapor

I loved this restaurant, it really is beautiful, as is the hotel. We went for dim sum as I had heard it is amongst the best in Singapore. The dim sum I tried was very good. However is was the peking duck with pancake that was really memorable. I would definitely love to come back for dinner and try many of the dishes on their menu. Service at Yang Ting is very good. A five star service and highly recommended if you want authentic Cantonese in Singapore

We were here with some friends for my birthday and we truly enjoyed our lobster lunch. The food was great, we ordered other al a carte dishes. Excellent service! We also had the taste of the aloe vera jelly for dessert, which was quite interesting

We are regulars here. We may be biased because we always get excellent service and great tasting food. The staff recognise us and take care.This restaurant has been a favourite ever since the St. Regis opened in Singapore around 4 years back. The choice of dishes is varied and is suitable for vegetarians too. The chefs are flexible enough to alter some dishes if you have any particular preferences. We don't eat beef and pork, so the kitchen is very careful about this. The good thing is that you can eat or taste many dishes and not feel stuffed. The cuisine is light and well presented. Some favourites include the ee-foo noodles, monkey-head mushrooms with burnt chillies, and the herbal jelly with honey for dessert. The sea food is excellent.In Singapore, as in many countries, you have to be careful about the oil that is used for cooking. Pork lard and MSG are often used in Chinese cuisine and that's not for us. And even if some vegetable oils are used, the wrong ones leave an after-taste and a heavy feeling in the tummy. Not so at the Yan Ting. But if you do not want pork lard, you have to miss out on many varieties of Dim Sum.The side rooms of the Yan Ting are available for larger groups or private bookings. These are popular, as some large family clan or business gatherings do get joyfully noisy!Singapore is not a cheap place, either to live in or to dine out. Prices at the Yan Ting are the same as a similar quality restaurant not attached to a luxury hotel. There is no "St. Regis price" here, but the excellent quality shows

This has been my favourite dim sum. Whenever there's guests from overseas we love brining them because its ambience is stylish and the services and food are excellent. Its good for huge dinning especially its private rooms. Never fail to impress me everytomr and I look forward to visit for the umpteen times:

I went for Dim Sum on Easter Sunday and ordered several dishes. The portion of the dim sums are really tiny. The siew mai and lobster dumpling meat smelled really bad. The lean pork and century egg congee had no rice in it, instead it was a watery soup with a few hairs of dried pork and the century egg in it stank so bad I could not eat it. The mango pudding was too sweet. The har gow or prawn dumpling was delicious though, thin skin with prawn juice dripping inside the little packages. The char siew bun had actual bbq pork pieces in them that were tasty and sweet.The worse part of our visit was the service. We had ordered 3 other items and the waiter had completely forgotten about it. We had waited for a while and the dim sum dining time was drawing to and end. Instead of admitting his mistake, he insisted that the order was on the way and then turned his back behind us to make an order with the kitchen. I did not appreciate the dishonesty of the waiter at St Regis.Overall, I will not visit this place again as the service is bad, the food is mediocre compared to the hefty price tag (almost twice the price of dim sum at standard Chinese restaurants in Singapore). We sent approximately $55 per person purely on dim sum without ordering any main rice/ noodle dishes which were priced at approximately $25-$30

I tried their Tofu vegetables and rice. It was pretty delicious with optimum spices/ herbs. Services were so forthcoming and take personal attention.
5
This restaurant has fabulous food, and requests are taken very seriously. Gluten free food was no problem and suggestions off the menu were recommended as well. We ate there regularly and prompt and efficient service was consistent.

For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatWe had a special 7 course set designed to give us a preview of the 10 CNY set menus that Yan Ting has this Snake year. Think of this as a best of dishes list. Yan Ting has switched the radish for snow pear to give their Yu Sheng its subtle sweetness. I like that the sauce is lot less sweet than the usual Yu Sheng because pomelo juice is added. Abalone and Salmon are also included in this dish.Yan Ting's Pun Choy is the luxe version with abalone, dried scallops, dace fish, pork belly, fish maw, prawns, roasted duck and soya sauce chicken, layered on a bed of white radish and cabbage. This is no doubt one of my favorite dishes of the night. You could also take this away for reunion dinner at home. Each takeaway order receives a complimentary Salmon "Yu Sheng" with Fish Roe, and Fried Glutinous Rice with Preserved Meat, all stellar dishes. This is a great leftover dish because the flavors are more intense overnight and the ingredients more tender. Definitely my favorite leftover CNY dish. :)More dishes in btn...Till that point in the dinner, I had been sampling all the dishes in an effort not to overeat. But when the Wok Fried Glutinous rice with Wind Dried Sausages was served, i finished every single grain. The dish is very simple but it tastes like home, very heart (and tummy) warming. I guess i tasted the effort Chef put into bringing in the special wind dried Chinese sausages from Hong Kong

Not well versed in the nuances of high end Cantonese cuisine, so let other take care of ordering. Everything was prepared to a very high standard and service was good. But wouldn't rush back - that might just be a lack of understanding of the finer points of the style

Mmm, where to start. This one is a little difficult because a previous experience from a friend with impeccable taste had been good, mine however didn't live up to the promise. First, the seating arrangement, a little awkward on a round table with our neighbour as our semi companion, listening to every word...I guess, as I could hear every word they were saying(on the phone), not much privacy. The service staff is excellent, well trained and smooth in their delivery (Kevin is one of those caring and attentive waiters). What they deliver however isn't up to par. Granted, I am a little of a spoiled brat when it comes to Singapore food but then again, the competition is gruelling and I can go and eat anywhere. Basically, most food was oily, you could taste the grease in which the dishes were fried and thus it was all quite...oily! The steamed dishes were average and not necessarily worth the visit. The desert was good, aloe vera gel with mango..

Compared to the quality of Chinese food available elsewhere in Singapore the food here was average at best. Barbeque pork - could have been leaner and was saltycrispy roast duck was good when served in pancakes, but second version served with noodles was bland and tasted only of egg.
4
If you're after upmarket ethnic food during your visit....then the Yan Ting is well worth a visit. It has all sorts of traditional foods, some of which I gave a swerve, but did enjoy the lobster. The service is possibly a trifle overbearing, the prices not a bargain but the quality of food - 1st class. Portion size is reasonable and with more than 25 dishes to chose from, its a real taste of Singapore

We had been to Yan Ting a few times before going again for a valentines treat. A special valentines set menu was offered and we were pleased they still had the normal set menu and ala carte options available.As usual, the food was great and the service too. As it was busier than usual, we couldn't sit the along the side of the restaurant where each table was separated by curtains, offering some privacy. Instead we were seated where the tables were laid out in a circular fashion sharing a central circular bench-interesting layout, especially when our neighbouring diners turned out to be our friends and it made for easy conversations with each other while at the same time it was easier for each table to have private conversations as well.We over-ordered coz we couldn't make up our minds and decided to take away the food to our room. It's probably due to new food regulations that were being rolled out soon and they made us sign an indemnity to take away the food- how peculiar.We do enjoy eating at Yan Ting and will go back for a treat (due to the price)

If you are an adventurous foodie here is the place for you its gorgeous and delicious!!The ducks tongue,pigs ear and crackling pork were out of this world!pig sinew was"interesting"in that it had a spice which reminded me of a perfume.portion size was perfect and the food wasn't greasy at all,perfect restaurant to follow Dukan or Atkins!

I must admit, it gets little pricy here, but no one expects an affordable meal here anyways.Overall service is great, good consistent quality food, and nice ambiance.We had a set meal for 10 persons. Is it worth the money? Well, I would just say that we come here only for special occasions. You can find better tasting food at this price.You can find better ambiance restaurant at this price.You can find better service from the waiter at this price.But to have great tasting food, ambiance and service overall, Yan Ting could meet your expectations

I liked everything about Yan ting, the service and the food - top class

Food is ok , setting is quite nice but the service is simply horrible.The waiters; waitresses are rough and rude.I will not return.
5
excellent chinese cuisine, for any occasion and anyone old or young can enjoy it, I guarantee it!!!!

My wife and I shouted ourselves to a lovely banquet meal while staying at the hotel. The ambience was calm and understated, the service exceptional and the dishes delicious!

Service in impecable, the presentation of the dishes is great and the food in magnificent.
Some dishes are too exotic for my taste, like duck's tongue, but the gfood is delicious

Good restaurant, but I wasn't able to find something special

We had an early dinner in Yan Ting. They have an excellent selection and the food looked and tasted great
1
We have booked a table for high tea.First description of the decoration , it seems like money has been thrown in all directions but the good one. There is no feeling of luxury by entering the narrow entrance, it will stay so until we reach the restaurant. Tastes can vary, well it definitely does here.The restaurant all is facing the pool, and the wall in our back is covered with mirrors, like in a 19th century girl house.yThe table cloth are not ironed which contribute to have a not very neat impression of the place.My napkin was covered of stains when it comes so I asked the lady to change it.We are auite sensitiv when it comes to table ware, which are are very tacky there.....Not quite for us It took forever to get the staff to take our order. Starters, are made of few sandwiches and scones, nothing special.We had a main course made of quiche and see food soup. The choice of dessers is limited to a few itemsGood for us.The desserts were not fresh and eclairs were from the day before or not stored properly after being baked.Staff doesn't seem to be in the room to serve guests, I didn't quite understqnd whar they were doing yet.It definitely a place to stay away from, overprices by far too much, and to be forgotten for its food.
5
I am a frequent diner at the restaurant only because their food is impeccable and can be catered to your tastes as long as you tell the lovely waiting staff what your preferences are. I am a frequent traveller, though based in Singapore, and have yet to find another chinese restaurant anywhere in the world which can better Yan Ting in terms of ambiance, service and quality of food. Look for the congenial manager, Sally, who will always go out of her way to make your experience pleasantly memorable. Food is on the pricier side, but this is St. Regis after all and you will get what you pay for

I arranged high tea at the St Regis Singapore as special occasion with some friends who were visiting from out of town. All I can say is that it was incredibly disappointing. Our order was incorrectly delivered to the table 3 times. The tea was cold when it arrived. We had to constantly ask to have the tea pots topped up. The service was poor for the entire afternoon right down to the bills being dropped onto our table without pens to sign the credit card slip. St Regis really need to sharpen up their act if they want repeat business at $56 ++ per head. Very disappointing ++ per head. Very dissappointin
5
Pricey but worth it--oustanding Chinese food in Singapore.
5
Dim sum was the best and we've eaten alot of dim sum. Pricey, but well worth it. The service was amazing.
4
Very fine dining - chinese cantonese cuisine but service of staff can be too snobb
5
Good food, attentive service.
Had the dim sum brunch with 3 other friends. The lobster and the sharks fin were great.
5
Dim sum is also fantastic. Not crowded like other spots. Feels like the chief and the staff really care about giving you a great meal and dinning experience
2
over-priced, pretentious, lacks atmosphere, over bearing service, portions too small. some of the dishes were v good, but not all and none were outstanding.
1
Went for a birthday dinner celebraion. Ambience was nice. Service was attentive. But food was way below expectation and expensive. Soup was salty and their signature kurobuta pork was nothing to shout about. Waitress actually told us that their Peking Duck was ordinary (i.e. not their sgnature dish) when we wanted to order it! For the price range, there are much better Chinese restaurants in Singapore
4
Went to the restaurant when we were staying at the St. Regis for a conference. Have to say that the overall experience with St. Regis including this restaurant was quite memorable. They really cater to every whim that you can have gastronomically. Very impressed with their efficiency of their service and their attention to detail
5
We always stay at St Regis in Singapore, and have had dim sum and dinner at Yan Ting countless times since it's opening and for us, it's just perfection. I don't think it's any more expensive than other quality Cantonese restaurants and each dish is excellent, maybe some dishes are on small side but it's all about quality over quantity. We've have great food at many Singapore restaurants but it's the combination of beautiful food in an elegant setting that makes it our favourite...it's the most civilised dim sum we've ever experienced

We paid more for the champagne brunch than others because they bumped up the price for New Year (SGD150 incl non-stop Perrier Jouet champagne). If you're not a big eater / drinker it might be better to just go a la carte (dishes start from about SGD9) but we managed to put away 16 dishes and make a good dent in a third bottle of champagne between the two of us! Highlights were the jelly fish with beef shank and the intensely flavoured shark fin soup.Service was very good, not overbearing. It could be improved if they dedicated 1 or 2 waiters to a specific group of tables as you just had to grab anyone going by or whoever was filling your champagne glass. We ordered 2 or 3 dishes at a time and then when they came along we'd order another batch to give them time to get them ready. Coffee / water not included and as expensive as you'd imagine.A very worthwhile splash out and we'd go back
