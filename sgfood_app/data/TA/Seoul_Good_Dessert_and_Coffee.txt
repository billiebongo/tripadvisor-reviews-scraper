Their rice bowls are good, nothing very special, but filling. They have great chicken wings though!! The chicken wings are generously seasoned and the meat is tender.

My friends and I went for morning exercise at Coney Island, so we were tired and hungry by the time we came here to dodge the heat and enjoy a well-deserved lunch. Despite the name, Seoul Good Dessert and Coffee serves up great Korean-inspired main courses and savoury dishes. I had the Chicken Cutlet rice bowl and I enjoyed it a lot -- the chicken was well-seasoned, and the kimchi and pickles were delicious too.The rice was also good-quality, but there was a tad too much of it (we are all girls and all 3 of us left quite a lot of rice behind on our bowls).I also recommend the Bingsu and the hot latte (the latter especially was very fragrant and creamy). Note however that seating is very limited so you may need to get here early or be willing to eat outside

It may have claustrophobic seating areas, both indoor and outdoor...It may need you to wait a rather long while for your food to be ready on a busy day.... about 10-30 minutes.But we actually quite like the place. Food is tasty, not superbly overwhelmingly michelin-class, but you could see and taste that they have been passionately prepared. The good thing is, the kitchen crew knows they were behind schedule and keep apologising when handing us our orders.Their Bingsu is a must-try. Each one is sumptuous and awesomely stacked with icy goodness and tickle all your taste buds for sweet dessert.Couple by the unique layout of the entire park, we can only hope they keep it up, improve on their speed of serving and cleaning up after the diners leave.Looking forward to our next trip there.PS. What you see on the menu, may not be there on the self-help ordering kiosks, which is a setback when you see a queue of people trying to reselect their food options when they find that what they originally wanted were not there. Not helping with the speed when the touch pads had cracks on them from the previous impatient users whom had pointed a lil too hard on them.The wings are tasty, but can be very very very very messy...
