Nice place with a very nice menu, I had a superb spagetti dish with some of the best prawns I have ever had, great alcohol free coctails as well, on a hot day, just the ticket!!

We had some really nice pasta from here.Even had veg option(for me). Little expensive though, everything in Singapore is expensive! Pasta in red sauce tasted really good. Good service too.
