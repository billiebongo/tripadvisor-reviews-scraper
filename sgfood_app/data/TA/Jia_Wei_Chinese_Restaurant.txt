This restaurant is on the 2nd floor of the Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy across the Parkway Parade shopping center. Very good Chinese foods. Good ambiance and good service too.

In singapore there are so many food options, we don't usually eat in at the hotel, but so glad we did. The food was really enjoyable, plenty of choice, generous portion sizes, happy to recommend.

We dined with a friend on our last night.in Singpaore for a special occasion. The food was very good and the staff attentive.
The surrounds are very nice.
4
This was a very nice place to eat and the food was delicious. I was able to order something that wasn't overly spicy as I'm not into eating very spicy food. The service was great.
5
The place is cozy and comfortable. The restaurant does have private rooms for guest who wants to celebrate special occasion. Good varieties of Tim sum. A must try on the drunken chicken. Tim sum was good and tasty. Value for $$
4
We had a lovely dim sum lunch. Service was nice and fast. Food is 8/10. And there is a 50% discount until the end of August.
5
We came here for a family gathering and had a good time. The place was not very crowded and had a very pleasant atmosphere.The Chinese food was very tasty. Not too salty yet flavorful. The food was prepared delicately and the presentation made the food looked very appetizing.The service was very good too. Our tea cups were constantly being refilled by the servers.Pricing reasonable too for the high quality food.Highly recommended
5
We decide to eat here as we were staying in the hotel and we had just spent the day travelling from Langkawi so we were rather tired. I would have to say this was probably the best chinese meal I have had, compliments to the chef. The hotel also offered a discount for guests at this restaurant
4
First visit for my friend's dad birthday. Decided to give the restaurant a try given the good reviews online and we had accord membership to enjoy some discounts. Food was quite good both in taste and quality. Service was good and with reasonable pace. Pricing seems quite reasonable as well. Definitely will revisit the restaurant with my family
5
They have awesome food here which can be pricey but it is well worth it and its close to the hotel..
5
This is a typical better quality Chinese restaurant which offers great Chinese food. Service is good and food is well priced at the upper end of the Chinese market.

Friends staying at the Mercure Roxy invited us for lunch at the in-house Chinese restaurant. Much to our surprise and delight the experience turned out to be excellent, one of the best Chinese meals we've experienced, and we've experienced many.The speciality was Peking Duck and I was immediately impressed with the way the dish was prepared, skin without any flesh attached; perfect. Service spot on.The rest of the menu we left to out host, an old Hong Kong hand who chose well putting together one of the best Chinese meals in memory.Some way from the centre of Singapore but well worth the effort to get there.Highly recommended
5
We had the best lunch here!!! They have a weekday special for 50% off dim sum lunches and an amazing coconut custard dessert! I was really blown away by the service and the amazing food! The dessert was very light and refreshing, not at all what I expected (past experiences). It was also just the right amount of sweet. Sorry, I forgot to take pictures of the delicious dim sum (too busy eating!) I cannot recommend this place enough
4
A well decorated place in a discreet atmosphere with delicate dishes served with style....Good staff, well groomed and friendly, Quality of food is credible with a vast choice of dishes prepared by a renown chef. A bemol though: Tap water must be at premium because it is chargeable to customers. Peanuts put on the table on staff's initiative , is also chargeable...Well....In Rome, do as Romans do, so visitors can still enjoy this pleasant restaurant. Almost excellent restaurant 
4
Been here on a weekday dim sum lunch. Nice ambience as we stepped in. Received by staff with a warm smile. Servings are not big portion but just right... in 3 or sometimes 4. Beancurd rolls with oyster sauce, spareribs with preserved beans and carrot cake in xo sauce are thumbs up. HK Kai Lan vegetables garlic is really good cooked with shredded ginger too. 2thumbs up for this veg. Round up with deep fried durian ice cream which we promised to come back again. Staff Vyon and Jasmin were so polite and friendly in their service. One staff opened and hold the door out for us when we were leaving ending with the restaurant's hospitality as one of the best in town!
4
The restaurant is situated inside the Grand Mercure Roxy and I being a resident in the hotel decided to try and I have no regrets.The service was great and the pumpkin soup I had was much above expectation. The restaurant has a wide choice of vegetarian dishes, my wife's favorites.She too enjoyed the food servedThis restaurant is suited for fine dining
2
We have been highly disappointed by this place - food, service and price nothing saves the other. The food is really average, we ordered 6 different dim sun and nothing was more than just ok. The service was cold and while we were eating a member of the staff was tidying up the dishes into the cabinet. We had a 30% discount coupon from the reception that hasn't been applied - we only got 15% because the waitress told us dim sum wasn't part of the 30% discount. This was written nowhere on the coupon. After reviewing the bill later, we noticed that the pickles (which we were provided but not told we will be charged for) haven't had the discount applied
5
This place is amazing. We were totally lost with the menu and the manager helped us out and ordered some delicious stir fried asparagus, two types of prawn (to die for ), sweet and sour pork (amazing ) and special fried rice. Altogether probably the best meal we have had anywhere in the world
5
My family had a great meal in this restaurant last month, as part of their Chinese New Year celebration menuThe service was attentive, prompt & polite.Food quality was excellent. We had suckling pig which was just so amazing.The other dishes were also good quality. The sweet & sour pork was of a very high standard.The local desserts of fried durian icecream & fried chempedak icecream were delicious
4
My wife and I ate here and enjoyed the meal and service. We found the food to be nicely prepared and served. No complaints.
4
good food and value for money. can taste the food does not have preservatives like aji-no-moto (msg). The variety of dishes and quality is commendable. Besides to top it, is the friendly hotel staff.
3
Had dinner there with my family. The ambience is normal, service is above average. Food in general is average in view of the price charged.
4
Jia Wei has always been a favourite dining venue for us. Consistently high standard Cantonese cuisine. Attentive table service. A little pricey, but good things don't come cheap these days, esp when a good manager is tagged to it.
4
On the Saturday we went, Jia Wei seemed to be a little understaffed.The bamboo design was pretty good !
我们去的那个星期六，家味似乎人手不足，服务比较慢。
5
We had dinner here on 3 Feb. We were the only non asian persons. For two persons there was nothing on the special new years menu. The staff was very helpful when we couldn't get decided on the a la carte menu. After we'd asked they would prepare the special new years menu for two. It was really special. The staff explained the dishes to us and the meaning of the food like Yu Sheng. We had a wonderfull evening with excellent food and a memory to cherish
4
Service staff was prompt and friendly. Our server was very humorous and we had fun guessing what was inside the claypot (we had 3 claypot dishes). Food was very well presented. Most of the dishes were delicious (peking duck, roasted meat). However, some of the food were not up to our expectations (e.g. crab not as fresh, starters
3
Decent deco and food but very quiet for a Friday night.They have Tim sum too that you can order.The carrot cake is pretty good but Siew Mai is ordinary.We have fish maw soup which is thick and tasty, Big head prawn with little meat actually and Opak leave beehoon that did not seems to absorb the taste or any wok hei smell.We have durian penget for dessert which is thick, with visibly purÃ©e but just don't have that fragrance smell.The chrysanthemum was very diluted. Overall it's just ok restaurant, $50/pax after 20% discount for UOB card
5
Having had dinner and lunch here numerous times during my stays at Hotel Grand Mercure Roxy I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience. It has become an easy favourite despite so many other awesome restaurants in Singapore. The service is always attentive without being over the top. The menu is extensive with a great selection of authentic Cantonese cuisine that I never get tired of. The food itself is always delectable and of a consistent high standard. If you are staying at the hotel then Jia Wei has to be a must for lunch or dinner
4
As a plant eater, I was delighted to find a comprehensive vegetarian section on the restaurant's menu when I stayed at the Grand Mecure Singapore Roxy.The delectable Cantonese cuisine was thoroughly enjoyable and I can clearly taste the "wok hei" (the flavour rendered by the Chinese cooking vessel during stir frying)
5
Dinned in for dinner,the food was exquised as was the service,beautifully presented and the taste was sentational,highly recommend.
5
Wow! The food was incredible and the staff very friendly and accommodating. Very diverse menu. So many items to try. Very good.
5
Great Breakfast spot. Great Range & good value. Open early if your need to get to the city & very welcoming staff

I have already posted a review of Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy, where is my most favorite hotel in Singapore so far, and this restaurant is located on the 2nd floor. However, last July was the first time I ate at here with my friend. Just before my friend returns to Tokyo, we entered this restaurant because the items on the menu (we pre-checked it over the Internet) looked fabulous as well as the location - they are inside of the hotel so we wouldn't be exposed by the steamy hot Singapore weather. Furthermore, because we stayed on executive floor (maybe?) we received a discount coupon which can be used here, Jia Wei. We asked a representative in the executive lounge to secure our table, and entered relatively early dinner at 18:30.They have several course menus but we went with a-la-carte items. Peking Duck is always our favorite, no wonder I'm living in San Francisco Bay Area. Then... when I placed the order, the serviceperson asked me how the leftover of the duck should be cooked. From that question, I expected the duck would be served 'skin-only' which maybe the traditional way, but in California or at least the Chinese restaurants I go scrape the duck skins with meats. So I replied him "Please scrape the skin with some meat, if you can't do it, just thru the meat away, then." which is a very spoiled and selfish answer. Now I do regret answering like that. Then... the serviceperson went to the lady who looked very skilled and professional, and she came to our table and double-checked my request. Surprisingly that smart lady, Ms. J.L., is the Restaurant Manager and our Peking Duck was prepared by herself! I was feeling guilty so much by that big-shot lady was directly taking care of our table. Hence the Peking Duck was very carefully and perfectly prepared with great presentation. Other items are also outstanding compare to the other high-end Chinese restaurants in Singapore.At the final of this great experience, we requested to see the dessert menu, then every single person of the service staffs strongly recommended to try that night's special - Coconut Pudding, and lastly when we place the order of desserts, Ms. J.L. again pushed me to try their Coconut Pudding, so did I. Their recommendation was right. The pudding was very delicately but certainly flavored with fresh coconut, and its texture was so delicate too, served in a coconut shell which is a very attractive presentation. I totally understood why they pushed me to try that. I even felt guilty using the discount coupon because of this outstanding experience. My friend and I were really surprised and couldn't believe the price we have paid. It was way lower than we expected even if we didn't use the coupon. If you stay or come around Katong area, this restaurant must be the top listed for Chinese cuisine for sure

Had a meal with family members while visiting them and had an enjoyable dinner at this restaurant at the Grand Mercure Roxy. It was a weekday night and was surprised by the low patronage that evening. We had a sumptious Cantonese dinner so much that we had to skip dessert. Would return again
5
With the accor advantage plus membership I managed to get a peking duck at 50% off and it was stunning. They wheeled it out on a trolly and sliced it up in front of me. I was a happy camper by the end of the meal. It was delicious and very satisfyingl

Took two of my friends there for lunch on a weekday. We were seated at a cozy corner, just as I had specified when I placed my reservation through phone.Nice place, I had been there a few times but this was really a quiet lunch, making us felt like we were having 'fine dining' experience. The cutlery were beautiful.We started with some dim sum, then into a few dishes of main course. Good variety of dim sum, loved their fried carrot cakes. We ordered the fried vermicili on a leaf (fried bee hoon wet style, spead over a leaf)...this was excellent! My friends kept talking about it after the lunch.Desserts were good too. I ordered 2 mango puddings and they were yummy. I also ordered 1 fried ice cream and my friend said it was good too. The female staff were attentive. Only the male staff was abit quiet when we placed our order. Almost relunctant to speak.Overall, it was a hearty meal! Nice food with great company

We were at Jia Wei Chinese Restaurant located at Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy for a birthday dinner gathering on Friday. As soon as we arrived at the restaurant, their staff offered a warm welcome, ensuring we had everything we needed. The food served was hot and delicious, we like most was the Peking Duck. The food, decor and ambience of the restaurant met our expectation. Restaurant Manager, Ms Jenny Lim was exceptional helpful. She was super-friendly and professional at every interaction. We will return to try their dim sum dishes soon
3
So I obviously arrived in a bad mood - with the complicated car park that led to the shopping center and figuring out how to come to the restaurants the restaurant was completely full - so it was hot and noisy. I couldn't talk to anyone on the dinner table because it was so noisy. Food was good but couldn't enjoy with the headache
5
Our niece had a small post-wedding dinner celebration here and we have to admit that it was a great venue for a nice cozy celebration.Everyone agreed that the food was yummy. Most of the dishes were really good. In fact, we can't think of any dish that disappointed. The Gui Fei Marinade Chicken was one of the tastiest chicken we have tasted. The Braised Spinach Beancurd with Assorted Mushroom and Dry a Scallop was another favourite. Service was also very prompt and friendly. Definitely worth visiting.
5
Great food and wonderful staff. We left our food choices in their hands and they looked after us so well. The meal was delicious and the staff were only too happy to teach the kids how to use chop sticks. Loved it!!
5
This is an excellent Chinese restaurant . The food was delicious and I had a long wait until my flight and wasn't made feel that I was lingering .
4
We ate in this restaurant during short stay at Grand Mercure Roxy. Food is good and reasonably priced if you use the voucher from the hotel. Worth a visit.
4
they made curry crab was tasty and we had lasting memory of its taste anyone wishing should try this dish
5
Very good dining experience, had a whole Peking duck three ways - Pancake/Skin, San chow bow (Lettuce cup with minced duck) and stir fry duck with vegetables and rice. also tried the traditional dim sum which was lovely.Great service - ate here twice on our stay. Good foodHighly recommen
5
Pretty & Tasty Food. Chicken Herbal Soup surprising had lots of ingredients including fish maw, sea cucumber, dried scallops, shelled meat (i don't know what it's called). Souperliciou!Ordered a simple vegetable dish (cantonese - yao mak) cooked in fermented beancurd. Tasty!Had a whole roasted chicken (we had it free, i think we given this complimentary voucher when previously dined here).Crispy coloured skin topped with lots of fried chopped garlic.Smells Good Tasts Fantastic!Had a Bamboo Clam each. Usual style as rest of places but they used blacked garlic. Tasty with a strand of sweetness.But its was cooked abit too dry.We saved the Best for last - Coconut Dessert. I think you need to pre-order this in advance. They used Thai coconut with soft meat. They had the whole internal coconut filled with tao hua (hokkien) felt like coconut pudding which melts (literally) in your mouth. They topped it with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream...if there is a choice, i would prefer a corn ice cream plus that green jelly you find in Chendol.Need to try!! Must try!
4
we had a very nice dinner at the restaurant .The service was very attentive and we were very impressed. The entrees were excellent and the mains were good quality. As the were only two of us it would have been great to try more but the servings were fairly large.Worth a try especially if you are a quest of the hotel and have a voucher.
3
We had dinner at the restaurant and while it was reasonable value we found the service and the food just average although our entree's were good the mains [pork belly] were just so so. Certain tables seemed to get far more attention than ours which was disappointing
5
We had a lovely relaxing meal on a Saturday evening.The restaurant was busy with a big Chinese family birthday p[arty occupying a large area . I am always pleased to see locals in a hotel restaurant particularly if they are of the same ethic group as the restaurant theme. It generally implies good consistent food and ambiance and that was very true here.We didn't have a multi course extravaganza but the food we ordered was excellent. my wife's sweet and sour pork was the best she had ever eaten and my pork belly was delicious.Great value as well using our Accor card.Singapore doesn't do wine well or cheaply but that is a small issue when the food and general experience is so good
3
I have eaten here on a number of occasions, it has always been dim sum, or dumplings which are quite good. Tonight I had Chicken and Corn Soup, very small serve for 12 sg ++, very thick, corn flour I suppose.For mains I has prawns wrapped in egg and almond flakes, oily and sickly with steamed rice. 26 sg ++Service is good, have only seen locals eat here, would return, but will stick to dim sum and dumpling
4
Good quality food, nice decor, excellent service, not many guests as prices are quite steep. Handy when you stay in the hotel.
5
Fantastic place with outstanding food. The lady who was servicing us was very patient, knowledgeable and very helpful to answer all the questions we had - and we had many!! Thanks for a very pleasant and very nice evening!
5
Try one of everything. The soups and dumplings are to die for. Inside the Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel, not the cheapest place for Chinese, but worth it.
3
Not my choice (or perhaps cup of tea) of a place to dine at since there are so many restaurants within walking distance of the hotel.
1
Limited menu, quite expensive. Some of the dishes on the menu were not available. There were very few guests in the restaurant.

My colleagues and I were in the East, around Parkway Parade area and were looking for a place for lunch. After some deliberation, we ended up at this Chinese restaurant located on the second floor of the Grand Mercure Roxy Hotel. The restaurant has just launched a new menu, with the new head chef in their kitchen.My last visit here was about 5 years back. The restaurant sports a nice modern décor and the staff here are aways around to ensure the teacups are filled and attend to your needs.We ordered and here are the highlights of our meal:House Special Soup: $12 per person. The soup option changes daily. Today’s soup was the double-boiled pork rib and lotus root. Truth be told, I have been having a craving for lotus root soup for the past 2 weeks, so I was so happy to know that they are serving this today. It was chockfull of ingredients, including lotus root, peanut, dried cuttlefish and lean pork. I finished everything in the bowl. Even the lean pork was tender and I dipped it in the cut chilli and soy sauce and ate it all up. We had some Dim Sum for lunch -- Crystal Prawn Dumpling: $5.20. For 4 pieces. This is made inhouse daily. The skin is not overly thick and the prawn filling is fresh and good. It tastes good. - Pan-fried Carrot Cake in XO Sauce: $14. The photo in the menu looked interesting, so I had to order it. Usually, XO fried carrot cake is fried loosely, but this was done in an omelette style. The carrot cake pieces are smaller and there was XO sauce which was mildly spicy and bean sprouts fried in the egg omelette. Its good. One portion is good to share amongst at least 4 people. - Seafood Porridge: $5. I can taste the stock that the porridge was cooked in. The porridge had prawns and scallops in it. Porridge was smooth, similar to the ones you find at Cantonese restaurants. Not bad.For Mains, we had -- Sakura chicken in Chef’s Special sauce: $20. Served in a claypot. I liked the way its served, in a claypot with a wooden base. The chicken is tender and flavourful. Its tasty! - Braised Home-made Beancurd with Minced Pork and Mushroom: $16. The bean curd is formed in a rectangular shape mould and deep fried. Its soft and smooth. The tofu is topped with a gravy with minced pork and diced mushrooms. Yummy. - Vermicelli wrapped in Opeh Leaf: $20. Great presentation. The vermicelli (bee hoon) is stewed in a broth that’s made from chicken bones slow-cooked for 6 hours and the yellow brith is from the addition of carrots. There’s prawns and shimeji mushrooms in it too. After cooking, the chef wraps it up in ‘or peh’ leaf and bakes it for a short while, so thenodles take on the added flavour and aroma from ‘or peh’ leaf. This is easily for 6 pax. Good value. Highly recommended!We had to end our meal with Desserts -- Custard Lava Bun: $4.80. For 3 pieces. What’s unique is that the buns are black, as they use carbon in the dough. Break open the bun, and the molten custard oozes out. Recommended to eat immediately when they serve it. Must-try!- Custard Layer Bun: $4.80. For 3 pieces. This is 9 layer steamed cake with plain dough interlaced with custard layers. On the top is shredded pumpkin. The custard is a tad salty, cos of the salted egg yolk. Its nice. - Red Bean Dessert with Glutionous Rice Ball. A traditional Cantonese dessert that’s executed well. The red bean paste is tasty and glutinous rice ball had peanut filling, which is also good. Try it!The food quality is good and we enjoyed our meal. I will definitely be back again with my family for family gathering. Recommended

Decided to have dim sum brunch during our family outing to ECP last month and we headed over to the closest decent hotel in the vicinity. Dim sum here is not extensive in terms of variety but the you will get the basic stuffs i.e. siew mai, har gao, etc. The food was fresh but somewhat lacking in taste. Service was OK. Would expect the price to be competitive given the location and quality of food but unfortunately not.It'll be hard for us to return unless we are in the vicinity again and craving for dim sums
4
Absolutely delicious! I've stayed in this hotel many times but this is the first time that I've been to any of the restaurants apart from where we have breakfast. I was dining on my own so just had the honey spare ribs and fried rice. The ribs were absolutely delicious and thoroughly recommend them. The restaurant is a little on the pricey side though with a fruit juice costing S$9 but the ribs at S$28 was good as they were so delicious! I'll definitely try something else on my next visit
5
I was invited by my work colleagues to a meal in this beautiful restaurant and I'm glad I went. The restaurant was not too busy so we got good attention from the very friendly staff. For my starter I got the Honey Pork which was done just right and not too sweet. The meat was soft and tasty. Then I had the Fried Rice Noodles with Seafood and Egg. I love Rice noodles and this was fantastic. the flavours were perfect. Overall we had a perfect evening - thank you to all staff and to my colleague
5
The restaurant offers some amazing dishes. The chef offered us a dessert made of Aloe Vera and Mint which was a delicacy. Food was very tasty and the ambiance was great
