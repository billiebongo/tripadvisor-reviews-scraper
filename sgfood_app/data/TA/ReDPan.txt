Nice restaurant. Spacious and price reasonable. Food is delicious and children like it too. We ordered carbonara pasta, fries and lychee earl grey tea. Good!
5
We ordered the TrufflePork Floss Fries, Char Siew Nachos, Sausages, Hae Bee Hian Pasta and the Chincalok Steak. Enjoyed every single dish, especially the fries! A good combination of Singaporean favours with international dishes. Fusion done well!!
5
We had the starter chilli crab nachos, mains were otah fish burger and bak chor foie gras pasta and desserts teh halia creme brulee. Food still maintained the standard with nice environment and staff.
4
The mains and starters were all good! An interesting fusion of local with western dishes...
Desserts were not to our liking. I would come back for the food but I'll definitely skip the dessert.
Service staff was warm and friendly.
4
The ambience was good. Ordered Hae Bi Hiam pasta and Bak Chor Fore Gras pasta. Both was flavourful but a tad salty.
3
Decent Western Chinese Fusion food!! Love the Hae Bi Hiam pasta & Har Cheong Chicken Cutlet~ But not comfortable with the open seating concept~
4
Good fusion food and the quantity is pretty large for starters (Nachos). Nice dining atmosphere with above average service..
5
Went there with to try the Chope executive lunch set. Food was all good! Service was fantastic! Would definitely be back again!
5
Being listed as one of the most visited fusion food joints in the Marina Square area I decided to give it a try. Went there on a Sunday afternoon thinking there won't be any rush. To my surprise, it was bustling with locals and expats and I just managed to get myself a table.Ambience (4.5/5): Modern and stylish.Seating (4/5): High density but smartly planned.Food (This is the best part) (5/5): Started of with Truffle floss fries- innovation at its best! The chicken floss and the sauce make the fries absolutely delicious!Chicken cheese sausages: Sinfully tasty.Salad: Seared salmon edamame- A must try!Mains: Deluxe Cheeseburger: The chef's speciality as I advised by the server. Juicy and super tasty.Grilled fish and chips: Crispy, delicious and I had no idea how I managed to save some appetite for it.Steak: Cooked to perfection! All of this went down with a local beer.Overall an amazing experience. Can't wait to go back and try all the other dishes on the menu

Redpan food is a good attempt at mod-sin food, but I feel it would fare better if there was a more homely taste and aroma to the food. The truffle fries, served hot, was good, but unfortunately overpowered in taste and smell by the floss. The foie gras pasta tasted above average for sure, but was lacking in aroma. There wasn't much flavour in the mushrooms. Had the otah burger, which was surprisingly watery. Water oozed out of the patty when my knife cut into it. Maybe the cooking process involved steaming, which caused the unexpected juice ooze. The bun didn't do much for me either cos it wasn't crispy or buttery. Had durian alaska to end off the meal. The outer shell was wispy but sweet. The durian lacked the smell and creaminess of good durian ice cream,and the crust was a little tasteless. The lychee tea was good, though. Service was prompt, which is always pleasant.
5
2nd time visit there and am wowed by their food. Staff are friendly and attentive give and great ambience. Love the fusion mix on your menu
5
We had a delightful lunch which was a fusion of East and West cuisine. The ambience was great and so was the service. Great value for money.
4
The design of the restaurant is very nice. Good place to chat with friends as the place is not noisy.
3
1st visit to this restaurant, was a weekday and is pretty quiet. Nice and quiet ambiences for a gathering or meet up. Will visit there again when there is a chance.
3
Saw this dish o never tried before, was an interesting combo with cheesy nacho and chili crab. Great creativity there. The mushroom carbonara is good, not too rich. Both a bit on the pricey side
5
The truffle porkfloss fries set the tone right for the starters, followed by the fun mix of duck confit with housin sauce tacos and bak chor mee pasta. The durian meringue was decadent but it was the devil in the details such as a sprinkling of kaffir lime that knocked it out of the park. The marriage of flavours in every dish worked out perfectly, what a bold yet successful menu!
3
Food is great with a twist of the local flavor but the service level needs improvement. It was not busy when we visited on a Sunday afternoon but we were given a table by the entrance (reservation was made) and it was difficult getting the staff's attention
3
Considerable fusion of Singaporean and Western (Italian) flavour in the food. Interesting taste. Like the spicy fried chicken wings, and the truffle tossed fries. My wife thinks that it was rojak sauce that made the chicken tasty. The son (who is quite particular about food) seemed to enjoy his truffle duck confit taco. I thought that the Hae Be haim pasta was passable. The prawns were fresh but somehow the pasta turned cold rather fast. The steak chinchalok was a big portion but the chinchalok didnt seem to penetrate the steak that much. Finally I didnt like the Bak Chor Foie Gras pasta. I could rather have my flavourful bak chor mee at Bt Timah Food Centre any time. Service was great. Staff was friendly. Ambience - interesting but not totally comfortable, maybe it was a bit too open to the corridors of the mall
5
Beautiful decor, extremely hospitable service and high quality delicious food ... thats reDPan !!Visited this place twice during my last visit to Singapore. The fusion menu is interesting and unique.. beautiful blend of flavours.MUST TRY dishes - steak and chinchalok, prawn hae biam pasta, truffle floss fries, spicy fried chicken wings, lup cheong iberico pallela DRINKS: Interesting housemade drinks like lychee earl grey tea, roselle sour plum sodaWere too full for desert. Will try that next time for sure!
5
I have been to Redpan on more than one occasion. I really like the place the food and the way itâ€™s presented . The fries are definitely worth mentioning. I am a vegetarian so have limited choice but I have been friends who loved the steak and other dishes they have . I loved the desserts too on the Menu
4
We especially love that their menu has dishes with a fusion of western and local flavours. Will recommend friends to visit this place.
5
The service is good. The place very well decorated, and the food is not too bad. I like the fries and the chicken wings. There is a 1 to 1 beer promotion now. Can enjoy beer with their finger food.
5
Good food, ambience, price, dinner was reserved and was kind to receive a call from the restaurant, managed to seal a 1-1 deal
5
Hae bi hiam pasta was rich and flavorful, back chor mee with foie gra wasn’t as flavorful and authentic but the choice of shabu shabu pork belly and foie gra added fine touches to this glam up version
4
Great food served with good service. Recommended for all to visit. Otah burger is highly recommend. Great!
4
Tried the Truffle Duck Confit and Seared Salmon in Laksa Gravy. The portion size for the first was slightly disappointing. The second fared better; fish was cooked well and I particularly liked the potatoes. Menu had a number of pretty unique items which we didn't get to try. Restaurant was pretty crowded on a Tuesday dinner. Overall a good experience
4
Food was pretty good and the price was quite reasonable, together with the set meal. Service staff was also friendly and prompt. Only disadvantage might be that the location is quite out of the way, hard to find but also making it not too crowded. They were also having all day 1-1 happy hour drinks
5
The restaurant is situated in an excellent location within Marina Square. It is away from the crowd in the mall, making it a more conducive setup for dining and a nice conversation. We had the Roasted Vegetable Aglio Olio, Cold Pasta with House-Cured Salmon and Lychee Earl Grey Tea. Redpan puts a spin on its dishes with a Singaporean flavor. The food served is nicely plated, and taste delicious. Reservation is a breeze through Chope.Overall a great experience. I highly recommend this place for any casual dining occasions
5
The reDPan restaurant at Marina Square is usually crowded on weekends especially at dinner time. The restaurant serves a great variety of Western and Eastern food and excellent coffee and desserts. The restaurant is near the escalator and hence visible by all those who use the escalator. You can order chicken , beef, salad and drinks. The price is reasonable. I like the Latte coffee as the fragrance is discernible at once.The service is good and efficient and the waitress is courteous. It is a great place for a simple dinner with your family and friends. Even when the queue is long, the waiting time is short. I would recommend this restaurant to all readers and gourmet
4
My friend and I decided to try out Redpan because the restaurant was having a 1-for-1 promotion and the reviews on Instagram looked promising. I love how this eatery offers Singaporean fusion food at affordable prices - we had the bak chor tagliatelle and hae bee hiam tagliatelle, and finished off the meal with banana donuts drizzled in milo powder (TO-DIE-FOR). I would highly recommend this place to those looking for unique fusion food without breaking the bank!
4
The hae bee hiam pasta was great, offering a unique take on hae bee hiam. Also, the staff were friendly and attentive as well.
5
We love the fusion of the food! I had fish otah burger and it was so awesome! The ondeh ondeh cake gave our old school pastry a revival.
5
It’s was a nice and good experience dining in the restaurant with friends gathering together and eating good food. The service was good too :)
4
This place serves Creative fusion food at a quiet part of Marina Square. My family liked the hae bee hiam pasta!
4
Local twist to western dishes, e.g. har cheong chicken cutlet, which tasted delicious! Baked durian alaska and duck confit tacos were good too. One for one promotion for mains was value for money.
4
there got 1for1 main course during this month.
we ordered the beef and pasta.
i like the drink best there. lychee earl grey tea . can have a try~
5
Went there on a Chope one for one deal. Had the chicken and veg pasta. Both were delicious! Service was fantastic!
5
ReDPan is a beautifully designed space. It is well laid out and tables are not packed cheek by jowl with others, as is customary in most Singapore restaurants/cafes. The service was top-class - one of the partner (staff affectiionateky call him "Boss" was there and he was super friendly. The crew members were very warm, knowledgeable, efficient, and service-oriented. And the food, by the creators of GRUB, was delicious. We had the truffle floss fries, mushroom bacon carbonara pasta, vegetable lasagne, prawn and "hae bi hiam' pasta (my fabourite), har cheong chicken cutlet (could do with more "har" or prawn taste), and crispy fish otah burger, and they were all excellent. A gem of a place - will be back!
5
Stumbled across this really nice restaurant after visiting the Singapore Flyer. Located inside the Marina Square shopping complex. Food was excellent, staff and owner really nice and great with advice on what to order. 1 for 1 offer on beer all day as well as a bonus.
4
Was there with my sister, nephew and niece for lunch. Three of us ordered the Cinchalok Beef and they were delicious. The french fries was nicely done with a hint of truffle oil. I like the mashed potatoes which was mashed lightly, giving a nice texture and bite. The chilled Earl Grey drink with lime was really refreshing. Good meal. Would go there again.
4
Pretty decent menu, with a wide variety of food. Adding local flavour to the well known dishes adds the fun to the taste. Love it
4
The restaurant had a nice design and was spacious. Food came decently fast and taste was good. Would be best if service could be faster.
3
I went there due to Chope one for one promotion. Environment is quiet and cosy, very nice for gathering. We had Lap Cheong Paella (not very impressive) and Carbonara(this is quiet good, i like it).
5
good place to chill out , nice food ,great service also ....good nice price to have having good time over there
4
Liked the unusual infusion of local delights flavours into the western dishes. Was pleasantly surprised with their All Day 1-for-1 beer promotion for Oct 2017. Very nice and interesting deco. Will go back again.
4
Chance upon redpan few months back. Menu offers interesting and unique fusion creation using local ingredients. Food was great so we went back again.
5
Love the fusion concept - rich in taste and leaves one to crave for more! This was my 3rd visit and will sure be back again!
5
The food taste was really good and i love the "Char Siew Nachos". It's also a good place for friends and family for dinner gathering. Will definitely come back again.
3
I ordered the lap cheong paella. It costs 28 bucks. I expected at least above average quality for that price. It turned out very oily and the texture of the paella was so soggy it looked like poop. I could only taste the tomatoes and it was so greasy as if petroleum was poured into it. Worse paella i ever tasted. If they want to offer such a dish, i suggest the chef head to spain to learn to cook paella. Disappointment. Only their cakes were a saving grace there.
5
Went to see the place and experience the ambience while trying out some of their signatures.Tried the haebee Hiam shrimp pasta, lup cheong paella, tuckshop wings. Lychee earl grey and lemon earl grey teas were refreshing. Mains were of big servings and wholesome while tasting great.Service was excellent and it will be a nice place to host an upcoming birthday party.Looking forward to a customised buffet for the mains from SK.Thumbs up for the excellent experience
4
Service was really good, attitude towards the customers are great in terms of understanding and attentive towards customers' needs.
4
Am quite pleased with the menu that incorporated great local flavours into Western dishes. Will definitely be back to try the other good stuff! Surprisingly, truffle fries with chicken floss is oh sooo awesome and I loved the 'Prawn and Hae Bi Hiam Pasta'!
4
It is located quite conveniently in marina square. It is not very crowded which gives a good ambience for small talks. Their food is awesome and priced quite affordably. Will visit this place again.
3
Our first time to the restaurant, staff is very useful to give their recommendation, food is average, nothing special.
4
interesting sg food fusion! should try and good location easy to get to at marina square. nice to come with family!
3
The menu, though limited varieties was very interesting . We ordered a steak and a laksa salmon. Food was average. Service could be better. 2 non alcoholic drinks and 2 main dish cost $70ish. But the design of the place is really good.
3
The nachos and paella are quite tasty, however the laska salmon durian alaska are rather lackluster. Fast service though.
5
Excellent fusion singaporean food. I really love the pork floss truffle fries and the hei bi hiam pasta. They have very innovative dishes. Good atmosphere. Value for money. A very good place for group hangout. Highly recommended. Recommended to make reservations before heading down.
5
Great food from starter (truffle fries with chicken floss & Oldschool Tuckshop chicken Wings), to mains (Truffles Duck confit taco & Steak with chinchalok), to desert (Pandan & durian cake).
4
Been walking past this place for a few times and was attracted by the menu. finally got the chance to try out the food. The variety of food offered is just nice. Nothing too overwhelming until u cant decide what to eat.Food ordered1. Temasek Chicken Chop - serving was big for the price. My mom ordered this and she is a very fussy eater when it comes to chicken chop and the sauce. She loved it a lot which meant it was good. I did not try the chicken though.2. Fish and chips ordered for my 3 year old girl. 2 big pieces of fish for a very good price too! The batter was good and crispy! My girl finished one whole piece.3. Hae Bee Hiam Pasta - It was super good. The pasta was not over cooked and the hae bee hiam was not too spicy which would spoil the overall eating experience. The only downfall was that the dish got a little too salty towards the end of the dish......4. Bak Chor mee - This is definitely unique dish that one has to try. I cannot describe it in words but you have to eat it to know how good it is. But again, it got a little salty towards the end of the dish. Top up $3 for a side dish and a drink!!! Its very worth the price. Drinks were honey lime or earl grey lemon tea. both good and they even offered it hot. Side dishes were truffle fries with floss, salad or soup of the day. We ordered one truffle fries which was so good!! and 2 soup of the day which happened to be mushroom. However, it wasnt to our liking. It seemed to be aerated making it a little too foamy for a soup texture. It tasted bitter.....Desserts ordered1. Ondeh cake - i was sceptical at first because it was hard to find good ondeh cakes. But this was so good. All of us like the cake. It was not overly sweet and the cake was moist!2. Rainbow cake - Wasnt too bad but not worth the calories.3. Baked Durian Alaska - anyone who is a durian lover has to try this. My girl probably ate close to half of the cake.4. Teh Halia Creme Brulee - this is a unique dish but it was sad to say the dish did not taste 'teh halia' There was no taste of ginger as the name suggest but the texture of the creme brulee was excellent.Overall, this is a good place to visit. I am going to head back to try more of their dishes!!!
5
The service was a bit slow but overall, we were very noisy ourselves. Thankfully, we were not chased out.
2
Service was slow. Waiter not attentive. But they seemed friendly though. I think food wise is average only as for this type of pricing, there are a lot of choices.
4
Come here for the Mod-Sin food, and skip everything else! Our Paellea was slightly wet, mushy and was an underwhelming portion albeit with great flavours.
Savour the food with Singaporean flavours though and you will not be disappointed!
4
The food was good, and service was friendly. Value-for-money, I must say. I'd certainly love to go back to the restaurant to try other dishes.
5
tried the beef rendang and the truffle duck confit tacos. AMAZINGGG would eat again for sure but a bit on the pricey side thats all
4
Great hae bi hiam pasta! Tasty and sinful. The har Cheong Kai is not as good, crispy but dry. Will go back!
3
The cafe specialises in fusion food. I would say it's interesting but I would really rather have my local food in kopitiam.
4
Bak chor tagliatelle with foie gras was okay, tiny piece of foie gras, minced meat was a tad too much, otherwise would have been better. Steak and chinchalok was quite nice as well as roasted portobello mushroom.
4
The truffle fries is nice. Have a blend of western delights and local taste. Staffs are attentive and food are served timely. A good place to eat and catch up.
5
Food is unique with great taste. Tried their signature Prawn & Hae Bi Hiam Pasta, something that I've never tried before but turned out to be very tasty. Also a must try is their dessert - Banana Donut "Milo Dinosaur". Waiter is very attentive & ambience is good
5
Im so impressed by the quality and creativity of their food. Mixing He Bi hiam with prawn pasta is heaven !
4
The Hae bi hiam pasta and Luo cheong iberico chorizo paella were rather unique with the local twist.
5
Good food and fantastic service, especially loved the hae bi hiam pasta!! The waiter was also extremely nice in lighting a candle for a cake i had brought to the restaurant without being asked to
3
Nothing really special about the food. Only the floss fries was above average. Service was good though.
3
Had the duck confit taco which was average for the price it cost.
The lychee earl grey on the other hand was refreshing and nice.
5
At a glance the menu looks like standard western food like burger, pasta, etc but each is actually bursting with local flavors! Give it a try!
5
The food is surprisingly good as we were not expecting much since this is opened by an architectural firm. Nice deco for sure and good food.
5
Redpan was excellent! Loved this restaurant - good food, good service and good decor! Will definitely return!
4
We very much enjoyed the "Steak and Chincalok" & "Prawn & Hae Bi Hiam" Pasta! Every bite was just pure joy. The atmosphere was just relaxed enough for us to kick back & have a good chat. Keep up with the excellent service as well!
5
I have always wanted to try the dishes at Redpan. We had the prawn-hae bi hiam pasta which had me mind blown! Succulent prawns and the shrimp sauce went so well with the pasta. Also had the grilled kingfisher collar with chinchalok, the potion was huge and the fish was fresh. Grilled to slightly charred. Finally had the durian baked Alaska for dessert, made up of a layer of meringue, cake and frozen durian
4
First time trying this restaurant. Was impressed with the quality of the food. Fish and chips was yummy.
5
Went on a Chope exclusive deal. Order a main get the Har Cheong checked cutlet free. Both were delicious!
4
Fusion of local SG food with Italian pasta. Chilli mince prawn (hae bee hiam) pasta, nice! More spicy would be better. Service was prompt and good too
3
The sauce is flavorful and sweet. The portion is just nice, but the duck meat is quite little and too pricey.
4
Ambience great, food a bit of a hit and miss. Their truffle floss fries was excellent, but their squid paella and prawn and haebi hiem pasta was a miss
5
This restaurant is located inside marina square, easily accessible by mrt and within a short walking distance. When we reached, the waiter mention that it is fully reserved and we are first in queue. Roughly waited about 15 mins for the call. The restaurant has a romantic ambient and very quiet surrounding. Menu is Asian western fusion, interesting and unique, most importantly it is inexpensive. We have ordered tuckshop fried chicken wings, salmon steak with laksa sauce, ba chor pasta with foie gras and a durian Alaska. The serving is abit slow, should be due to crowded. Chicken wings came first, crispy with sour plum sauce, great combination and really open our appetite. Ba chor pasta meat is tender, foie gras is cooked just nice that it will melt in your mouth. Salmon steak is great and both came in big portion though the pasta is a bit salty. Alaska durian the exterior cream is too sweet for us, so we scoop away and the frozen durian is perfect. Highly recommended, good for gathering as well as couple, great ambient
3
It's a nice setting and centrally located. Not too packed which makes for good conversation / discussion. The choice of dishes is an interesting fusion of Singapore hawker fare style but uses Western ingredients. Some of the orders seemed a bit overcooked compared to past experiences. Overall if you want a business lunch, this is a decent restaurant setting wise don't think the guests will be "blown away" by the food
4
We ordered the fish n chips. Fish meat is thick and chips is very crispy but just too little:) with reservation via CHOPE with special code.. we had a main free. We choose the hey bee hiam pasta. With the special hey bee hiam and yet have able to maintain the taste of pasta. Prawns are fresh. With the lemongrass drink with goals melaka.. Refreshing. Worth a try. Will visit again for other items on the menu. Many interesting items
3
Decided to try Redpan because of the Chope promo which gave us a discount of 10% so we bought the voucher and headed there. Ordered the 1) Hae Bee Hiam Pasta, which wasn't fantastic in my opinion. The portion was a tad too small and the Hae Bee Hiam taste not strong enough to leave an impact. Also tried the 2) Har Cheong Gai Chicken Chop, which we were slightly disappointed with because the Har Cheong flavour was lacking, despite the chicken being juicy and tender. Finally, we had the 3) Durian Baked Alaska for dessert which we thought was special with as it's a torched dessert. However, the outer layer didn't really blend well with the durian inside and I thought that it might have been better if it was just solely durian. Nevertheless, the service was prompt and responsive
4
Though prices are rather steep here, the quality of food served and ambience makes it all worthwhile! Tip: Come during a weekday lunch to enjoy an exclusive special price of additional $3 for a starter and drink with order of any mains! The items that I've tried are: Lup cheong iberio chorizo paella, salted egg prawn tacos, truffle floss fries and banana donuts 'milo dinosaur'. Really enjoyed the lup cheong paella that's flavourful with a lingering spicy note and the truffle floss fries with a disitnct and aromatic truffle flavour that's really addictive!!! On the downside, the salted egg prawn tacos was a disappointment with a watery, diluted salted egg sauce drenched over the deep fried prawns. Barely any salted egg flavour (just tasted like a mix of egg and mayonnaise) that imparted sogginess to the otherwise crispy prawn batter. The milo dinosaur donut balls were also enjoyable, soft and fluffy with generous lashings of milo crumbs and crushed hazelnuts.
5
Nice restaurant with nice decor
Duck truffle taco and foie gras pasta were very yummy at affordable price
4
Food was good, staff was good in their service. Overall the experience was great! Will make a return trip soon!
4
Finally got to try their salted egg prawn tacos and duck tacos! Wasn't too immensed with sauce unlike other food establishments. Tacos were full of flavour!
5
We had the 'BAK CHOR' FOIE GRAS PASTA and PRAWN & 'HAE BI HIAM' PASTA. Both pasta dishes have very interesting flavours. The starters and dessert dishes were enjoyable too
3
Ordered the signature duck meat taco but the amount of duck meat was miserable. The service was very good though.
5
Food and service was excellent. Would recommend anyone to really give it a try. Pork Floss Truffle Fries were to die for. Steak with Chinchalok was superb.
4
Great service with attentive staffs. Interesting selection in menu with local taste. Better to make a reservation before visit during peak hours.
2
Read about this dessert a couple of times and curious to try. Excellent in look but poor on taste. The durian is very "fake". Will drop by to try the hae bi hiam pasta and hopefully doesn't disappoint.
3
We came to know of this restaurant through Chope's $1 deal. And no regrets at all to ordering the Truffle Duck Confit Taco... It was really delicious (not just cheap with the $1 offer)! My boyfriend also ordered their Lychee Earl Grey which was a very thirst-quenching combination
4
Had the truffle duck tacos which was quite nice. I suspect they used truffle oil because I didn't see any truffle shavings. Am not a big fan of truffle oil because it's generally a synthetic product. If you don't care about that, the dish was nice
4
Overall good food with reasonable value and friendly service. Food is interesting fusion though really just ok in taste
4
Interesting menu and was reasonably priced. The truffle floss fries and bak chor mee were really great.
4
Well, overall a great experience at redpan. The food is nice and meet my expectations. Portion was generally just nice. I like the truffle duck confit taco the most! Will sure go back to try out the rest of the menu.
4
The food was great and serving portion was just right. Price is a bit on the higher end but worth a try
3
Food was average, the har cheong chicken cutlet was dry and had no har cheong taste, the steak was too well done when we ordered for medium. best part was the truffle fries out of all the dishes we ordered.
5
First time was on a date and the server was very friendly and made it a great night. Second time, my friend found a thin plastic strip in her food and they were very sincere in apologies and made up for it with new food. The food is great and very unique too, only the price is a little steep. Definitely will be back
4
Good, rich food. Very tasty. Not huge portions, but suited someone wanting to have three courses. Durian baked alaska quite fun. Draft lager had some real flavour - not the average bland lager. Wine recommendation from the waiter was a good one. Friendly, helpful service. Atmosphere not formal but more upmarket than the furniture which although new gives sense of quite a cheap place
4
I went to this restaurant for dinner with my partner on a busy Saturday evening. Luckily we turned up without a booking and were able to be seated. It is an awkward location at the shopping centre and some guests pop in after their shop or like us just go there for the meal itself. The staff were friendly but not very attentive. We ordered drinks relatively quickly however we had to request to make a separate entree order and main order as well as ask for some table water. The pork belly pops as an entree with the mango sauce were delicious and I couldn't quite fault them. Similarly with the duck tacos and chorizo paella. The food was outstanding but the service was a little lacklustre. Would definitely recommend otherwise, perhaps a little bit overpriced but all is well.
4
It is a dining place serving fusion meal, you will have surprise when the food are served. And the food tasted great too. They serve wide range of drinks, coffee, beer, wine. Comfortable and good for chit chat, while enjoying the meal. Price on menu is above average, yet worth the money as the chefs put their afford in. Friendly waiters, and good table settings.
4
Location: Central, new wing of the revamped MSVenue: Tables are well-spread (not too noisy) and caters to different size of groupsService Staff: Ratio is alright, could be better if they were more attentive. But service level is still acceptableFood: Interesting fusion. Tried it yourself. Desserts are good, too bad we didn't manage to try the durian dessert. Not sure how it tasted, but sold out pretty early.
4
Steak and chinchalok a unique combination (fusion between local taste and western), the steak is tender. Staff are attentive and friendly.
4
We ate seafood paella and although the food is rather tasty, the portion which was intended for 2 pax turns out to be smaller than expected. Nonetheless, it was a good dining experience.
4
Location amd ambience was good, not too noisy nor quiet. Had a lovely time with my family. The service staff were helpful and attentive. Food was interesting, a tad too rich and salty but otherwise we liked it.
4
Ate dinner with a business associate at "RedPan" in the Marina Square Mall whilst visiting Singapore and whilst the flavours of the fusion dishes we had were very good all were made with too much oil.The Chicken Cheese Arabiki Sausages to start were delicious and my Prawn 'Hae Bi Hiam' Pasta was also very tasty, just a lot of oil sitting in my bowl when I'd finished. My guest had the Lup Cheong & Chorizo Paella which was again very oily indeed. I finished with the Banana Doughnuts with Ice Cream and my guest had Red Velvet Cake. We both drank Cokes and our total bill came to SG$97.11 (about GBÂ£59) which wasn't bad for what we had, although portion sizes for our main dishes could have been a little larger. RedPan has more of a cafe feel to it than a restaurant one, but it was very busy and popular. Service was a little unattentive, but when you did grab the staff's attention it was quickly responded to with a warm smile thrown in
4
Redpan has been on my to-do list for awhile, but somehow I never got around trying it. The place turned out to be quite easy to find: just follow the mall signs toward the Pan Pacific. Wait staff was pleasant and efficient, offering to explain the menu. The menu includes pastas, meats, and salads with local flavors - not overdone and at reasonable prices. I'd definitely return with family or friends
5
This is a must visit if you want to enjoy the fusion of local ( singaporean) and continental. Great beers available and ambeince is soothing. OK on the wallet and not a rip off. Been there twice and more to go. Do not miss the " teh halia cream brulee" in the desert
5
I'm normally not into fusion food, but the blend of Singapore and international cuisines is reDPan is genuinely enticing. Service is equally impeccable, prompt and friendly. The decor and music also make it a nice place to stop by in the evening for a drink and snacks.
4
And we did not want to venture too far from hotel so found this in shopping mall next to hotel and it was exactly right for a quick meal. Good deals on local beer and soft tacos with confit of duck and fresh salad just right. Good service and efficient restaurant. Reasonable prices.
3
First time at reDPan with my friend. Overall, it was a nice experience. Food is good and value for money. Service staff was good as well. Only thing I find is my table is just at the entrance. I made a reservation a few days before but I was given a table right at the entrance. Was thinking they should have given me a better seating inside or should have asked if I would prefer to be seated inside the restaurant
3
Dropped in here for a few drinks & a snack. Was very quiet & I had a house white whilst my partner had a Belgian wheat beer. Drinks & service ok but little ambience or character to the establishment. We also had the Truffle frites as a snack. Quite sweet although not inedible but did not seem to be any resemblance to truffle or truffle flavour. Perhaps they are a Singaporean thing! Wouldn't really recommend them as a snack. Walked past the same venue a day later & it was packed, so perhaps our timing was just wrong. It was ok, but nothing to write hoe about

Food is really awesome with a fusion of western and Singapore local taste. My kids love their temasake grill chicken and their rainbow cake was great too. The gathering was for my friend birthday and he really enjoys it especially their cake. Thumbs up!
3
Spacious and comfy place.
Dishes choose unexpected ingredients. However, taste was not as remarkable.
4
Innovative naming of food.
Satay beehoon pasta & laksa salmon is highly recommended!
Bakchor foie gras pasta also bring traditional Singapore flavors up to the next level.
Thumbs up!
5
It's a good place with nice ambience which is suitable for catch-up with family and friends. The menu looks creative and the food was delicious (fusion between local taste and western).
4
The food is quite good, it's a blend of chinese food cooked in fusion western style. Worth to visit at least one time!
4
I was feeling adventurous enough to try out this restaurant's fusion creations, and I am no fan of fusion, FYI. And I am thinking of returning. My seat was not very comfortable thou, that's a minus.
5
Though the menu are limited but each one of 3 dishes (duck confit taco, prawn hibiam pasta & salmon laksa) are very delicous 😋
4
I went there with two friends last Saturday for dinner. The food was good but not WOW. On the other hand, the desserts were really yummy. For food- I liked the pork pops: bite-sized pieces of fried pork belly. For dessert we shared the banana donut milo dinosaur, and teh halia creme brulee. Both were well received. The staff were all friendly and accommodating, and the place has a welcoming vibe.
4
Very creative and well,presented plates with substantial portions at affordable prices points. Truffle fries with chicken floss was a truly unique appetizer. Main plates were well balanced and interesting. Very nice decor, food and service. If this wasn't a mall restaurant, the bill would be twice the total.
4
Food is wonderful. Hae Bi Hiam pasta is a wonderful combo of Asian and Italian palate. If you want no carbo, Kingfish collar can be a good choice; well grilled, tender and came with spicy dip. Enjoyed our drinks; sour plum soda, and Lemongrass gula melaka.Staffs are friendly and attentive to our needs. Good for catch up with friends. But to note, place may be a little noisy and open.
5
The steak was great. Sauce was unique in its taste, different from the ones we usually get with our steaks outside. Pasta with the shrimp paste sauce was also good.
4
The food is innovative with local zi char flavours cooked in Western style. Food tastes quite good but drinks are average.
5
Great fusion if local and western cooking in pleasantly set up venue.
Great for couple and groups.
Ordered many different dishes to desserts, all yummy.
5
Food selection is unique, perfect fusion of western and asian food, creatively presented with warm services by their staff, and yet prices is reasonable!!
4
Great place to bring tourists to visit because it advocates quality modern local food and its really nice to see and yummy to eat!
5
Good environment with friends. Nice drink and bites. Staff there are attentive and friendly. My first and happy visit.
4
Loved Red Pan's rendition of the har bi hiam pasta! The char siew chilli fries were lacklustre and I recommend giving that a miss. The milo dinosaur with banana donut dessert was good but would have been better if the milo taste was stronger. I liked their creativity though
5
 interesting fusion menu! If you are looking for Not so common food for your weekend gateaway with Friends that like to try new things, I would recommend you. Redpan serves interesting fusion food that deliver a east meet west concept. Try the Chin ca Lok steak

Four of us had lunch there today and it was a generally good and interesting meal. We liked the modern look and feel, and the place started filling up from 1230 pm. It is a collaboration between the DP architectural firm and the Grub food group. Their system was down so we had to clarify our reservations with the server. We ordered two starters to share - the tuckshop chicken wings and the truffle floss chips. Some of us thought the chips combo was a little odd at first but we were won over at the end of the meal - the flavors complemented each other well. The wings were pretty ordinary by contrast, and could have been a little sweeter and sour.For our mains, we ordered the hae bi hiam pasta and bak chor pasta with foie gras. Both dishes were cooked al dente but the bak chor pasta was much better in terms of flavor. The hae bi hiam was spicy, as we liked it, but the taste was too heavy and monotonous (jelak) after half the dish was eaten.Two of us also ordered the steak with chinchalok and we thouroughly enjoyed the dish. The meat was grilled to our individual choices and the sourness of the chinchalok was nicely offset by the diced French onions. I especially liked the mashed potato, which reminded me of the bergedel served in Malay nasi padang stalls. The salad was okay, though it seemed to be an afterthought to me and did not enhance or detract from the taste of the meat.They had a promotion of a house drink with each main course, so we ordered three lychee Earl Grey teas and a strawberry and lime soda, which were refreshing.We ended the meal with two long coffees and their singature durian baked alaska. The dessert was nice, and the durian was not too overpowering, but the biscuit base was too hard.Service was okay and staff were attentive even with several tables occupied. Do try the place out if you are in the area

We had lunch on a whim at ReDPan one weekday and I was mightily pleased by the experience. I thought I'd give my comments in numbers for easy reading:1. Location is good. I mean, Marina Square is not the most crowded places in SG these days but since the renovation, there have been quite a number of good dining places that have opened at this mall. 2. Food is great! I am loving the fusion treatment on some Singapore's famous dishes. I ordered the Satay Beehon Pasta and though I ended up not really loving it ONLY because I don't really like my mains to be sweet-ish which turned out to be the case for this particular pasts because, duh, satay.:) haha. I did try my colleague's Prawn and Hae Bi Hiam's pasta and this, I thought, was sensational! We also ordered Pork Pops to share and it was very tasty, too. For dessert, I tried the Durian Baked Alaska and it was delicious! I'm not even a durian lover and I found this particular dessert more than satisfactory. The rainbow cake was also not bad.3. The restaurant's set-up and interior are quite easy on the eye as well. Nothing too dramatic but it does give the place a distinct feel.4. The staff was wonderful. The order-taking was seamless and our food was served fast and hot.5. Price is reasonable. ReDPan is recommended and I won't mind going back again to try other dishes
3
Truffle floss fries really good and overall plating is nice. We find it hard to get the staff to refill water and reminded twice for the bill though the restaurant was not packed.
5
Food was great. We tried Temasek Chicken Chop, Haebihiam Pasta, Bak Chor Foie Gras Pasta, HJK cutlet and Roasted Veg pasta. All was well done.
4
The food was a fusion of Singapore delicacies and the western cuisines. For example, pasta with satay bee hoon gravy. Nice place, good for groups.
5
Very consistent with the food taste. Glad to see some items are rotated. Drinks and cakes never disappoint. Keep up the good work and standard!
4
Food was innovative but a little on the oily side. Service was not too bad and child friendly place.
2
Dined at Redpan 3 times. First 2 times were awesome but the 3rd was a great disappointment. All the fried stuff we order were over fried. From Fries to fish and chips to Har Cheong cutlet. Only the Kingfish and salmon is good. Disappointed table of 7....sa
3
reDPan serves very unique food, blending a mix of local Singaporean influences with western food. Portions were generous enough and great value for the price we paid. The food was good but nothing to shout about, it wasn't wow enough. Still, all in all a good place for a decent "mod-sin" meal if you are in the area.
4
Usually I will walk away from fusion food, but I have to say that the guys over here are doing quite a good job serving up a few delicious dishes.The truffle fries and the steak are the must try here, blending well with the sauces.. However, the fried pork appetizer seemed too dry and tough for me.
5
Truffle Floss Fries, Bak Chor Pasta, Chinchalok Steak were the selected choices. However i will like to give a to te steak. The combi with mash is perfect. Usual steak will be served with chips, since we ordered a truffles fries. It blended perfectly. Thank You.

If you're in to food and love to try something new, reDPan is just the right place for you. I was there with my wife and child for lunch on Friday afternoon - right after the peak lunch crowd, and we were ushered to a large communal table a stone's throw from the main restaurant. That table could seat about 8-10 persons but we were the only ones then and had ample space to move around. For starters, we had the Truffle Floss Fries (read: Truffle fries with chicken floss). The chicken floss was an excellent combination; that slightly sweet end-taste to the floss accentuate the other flavours. Mighty awesome I would say, and if I had space for more, I would have ordered another, or maybe 2. Wife had 'Bak Chor' Foie Gras Pasta, and while she initially thought that it would look and taste similar to the typical 'bak chor mee' (minced pork noodles), she was wrong. Tastefully presented and a reminisce of local hawker food, the pasta was served with minced pork stew, seared pork belly and topped off with a piece of Foie Gras. I was quite sure that she loved the pork belly - though she asked and I declined, she quickly finished it. I decided to try the Steak with Chinchalok. Chinchalok is a typical peranakan (or some say Malaccan) food that has fermented shrimps or krill and served together with shallots, chilli and lime juice. For the unacquainted, it may smell pungent to you because of the fermentation technique used in creating Chinchalok. If you would like to try it, best that you have them place the sauce on a separate bowl so you can dig into your steak if you don't like Chinchalok The potato mash that came with the dish seems like it was slightly roasted in the oven, which gave it a nice texture. The only down side to this dish was the Chinchalok itself. I felt that it could have a tad spicier, and the fermentation a little longer - to bring out the true flavours of Chinchalok.Would love to try out more dishes the next time.4.5 stars for reDPan
3
Pork Pops-Didnt taste as great as expected. Truffle Floss Fries-crispy & addictive. Prawn & ‘Hae Bi Hiam’ Pasta-best item that night. 'Har Cheong' Chicken Cutlet-Prawn Paste smell was quite distinct tho the taste was lesser. Crew service was friendly & good.
5
Haebihiam Pasta was really delicious albeit too much garlic slices.
Roasted Veg pasta was delicious too, vegetables were fresh and looked appetising.
5
Loved the small touches such as having our name written on the table's reservation standee and the impeccable service. Great food as well, had a lovely night.
4
Interesting flavour of chichilok with Steak. Love the white sangria and matcha roll to bits. Will definitely be back to try other dishes.
4
We had the tahu telor tacos which I felt a bit lacking in flavour. The kechup manis was too watery and not glazey so it didnt have that sticky rich flavour I was looking for. The truffle floss fries was great tho a little on the salty side (that said I like my fries without salt). The price was very reasonable tho
5
Had dinner at reDPan last night. The satay dish was very well presented. I personally preferred the pork satay to the beef. The soft tacos with duck strips was surprisingly delicious as I'm not a duck fan. The last dish was grilled fish collar and it came on a bed of lettuce. The chincallok chilli sauce really added a kick to the fish and is a great accompaniment. The servers were attentive and very polite. Will go back for sure
4
A very pleasant dining experience. Located a short walk from our hotel, Swissotel, among other eateries. We had no trouble booking on line. We were gretly warmly and service was excellent. Meals were of a high standard, good portion sizes and well priced. Would definitely go back

I visited Singapore and met up with old friends to have a catch up lunch on a Sunday. I was surprised to see that it wasn't crowded - strange for a Singapore restaurant, but maybe it indicated the reality.The chicken wings and char siew ragout fries were OK, but I think the former were just run of the mill while the latter didn't really taste any different from regular ragout. The chincalok steak didn't taste of anything other than meat, while the prawn pasta just made me think of Japan's spicy cod roe spaghetti.So I guess what I'm saying is while the quality was good, the fusion food was try hard. In saying all this, the service was good, the ambience comfortable and I'd go back for the desserts.Decor seemed dated - early 00s, yet I was told this is new. Since I was treated to this meal, I have no idea what the prices are like. I suspect that are much better places in Singapore
4
First time eating here for a group dinner and we were not disappointed. Ambiance is relaxing and servers were polite even when the place was filling up on a weekend night. Food was plated lovingly and each dish tasted nice. Starters were modestly sized, good for 2-3 pax, starting at $7. The server was kind enough to guide us through the menu. Main dishes are priced around $12-14 and would be good for sharing between 1-2 pax. Love the Bak Chor Foie gras pasta, steak & chinchalok, and char siew chili fries
3
I'm a fan of modern Singaporean cuisine and was excited that it was being offered in redpan at a lower price point than other trailblazing restaurants in this area. My friends and I shared the char siew chilli fries, which I thought were really tasty. The char siew ragout is a very good idea, and it was pulled off well. A friend of mine had the hae bee hiam pasta, which she thought was too spicy, although the shrimp flavour was strong (in a good way). My kingfish collar was decent, although I'm not sure where the chinchalok even made it onto the plate. The accompanying chilli sauce was piquant and moreish; we asked for more in the end.As for the drinks, the lychee earl grey tea was pleasant, with the earl grey flavour rounding out the sweet lychee. However, my friends felt the roselle sour plum was a bit too sour. We also got the lemongrass gula melaka, and most of us felt that the flavours just didn't go together. The biggest reason why my rating is just "average" is because the food took rather long to come, and it wasn't all served together. I know the restaurant opened only fairly recently, so maybe the kitchen is taking some time to find its feet. I would return to try the other dishes on the menu that we didn't try this time round
3
Ok but experience spoilt from having th share a table with others who have noisy kids
Food wise good choice service needs improvement
4
Steak with chincalok was really well executed. Chicken wings were nice and portion size good. Value for money.
5
Nice and quiet place, decent portion of food at affordable pricing. Hope it stays this way, will visit again.
4
good for modern singapore food and a casual restaurant, it has a good selection of interesting beer!
4
western food with a twist of asian flavour. Tried the Pork Belly with bak kut teh sauce was really good.
4
Came here for my husband's birthday, the pork belly and the beef curry puffs dishes were great. Would def recommend to friends!
4
The food was good especially the Hae bi Hiam pasta and calamari! We also recommend to try the lychee earl grey drink. And before you leave the place, remember to have some matcha cake as dessert (:
5
We enjoyed our lunch in the restaurant.
The food concept is interesting - mixture of western and local.
4
So much thought put towards creating the perfect fusion of East meets west @ this restaurant. Loved the kingfish collar with the accompanying chincalok sauce! Will definitely be back!!
4
Ordered the Truffle Mushroom soup (good as always), char siew chili fries (something unique and addictive), Fried Chicken Wings (crispy the way everyone will like it) as well as the Steak & Chinchalok (refreshing element on top of a well-grilled steak). Food can be considered inexpensive and value for money. Worth a return visit anytime
5
Service was great, they have specials every week and tune their recipe by collecting feedback from diners which shows very sincere attitudes! Fusion food did not try-too-hard and were yummy. Definitely would be back again.
4
There is always a surprise element to the menu, additional items and it is all about bringing local hawker fare with European ingredients
4
The menu offerings are along the lines of western with a twist of local thrown in for a different flavour; fortunately these were well executed, and overall a positive experience. We had the chicken & the steak as mains - the portions were decent, and quite beautifully presented. Didn't have a chance to try their desserts but the flat white coffee was good. Look forward to dropping by again to try other items on the menu.
4
staff - we were there on a suday lunch time and I guess it was understaffed - our food came slow.... and i mean S--L--O--W. But they were friendly so I guess i could be more patient.premise - for a place that is co-owned by SG's largest Archi and Interior Design company, the decor can be better. I am no Bob The Builder but the design was not really WOW-tastic as many other food joints now.food - to me, all was good. BUT! can be better. The portioning of the food was good though. refer to me images, food was in honesty, 75%. One of the contributors here gave it massive drainage criticism.... do not be fooled by him.... he must have had gargled with Dettol that morning and lost his taste.verdict - parking is easy at Marina Mall. Resto is small so reserve to go. Not that expensive to me but can be more affordable. The fusion has to be more exciting with more exotic and creative combi of local flavours with a western twist. I will go there again of course.... I mean, how can I not want to eat the Beef with Chin-ca-lok on my own this time round
5
My family ordered the Char Siew Chili Fries, Salmon with Laksa Pasta, Prawn & "Hae Bi Hiam" Pasta, Roasted Vegetable Aglio Olio, Beef Short Rib 'Satay'. We shared the dishes like they were tapas. Everything was delicious! The top two favourite dishes were the Prawn & "Hae Bi Hiam" Pasta and the Beef Short Rib 'Satay'. The pasta was full of flavour. The 'Satay' tasted like it was cooked partly in a sous vide bag. It was so tender with still a tinge of pink inside! For dessert we shared the 'Teh Halia' Creme Brûlée and Banana Donuts 'Milo Dinosaur' with a scoop of ice-cream. It was the perfect way to end the meal! The service staff were also friendly and attentive. We will definitely return
2
I went there with 3 other friends. We regretted it and I had to apologise for even suggesting the place.The place looks edgy and modern, make no mistake. Perfect for a pretentious first date.But the food. Oh dear. For that kind of price, that kind of portion and that kind of taste? No. Just, No.Caesar Salad with silverfish. That silverfish was probably the only saving grace of the meal as I used it on every other dishes to give them flavour.Vegetable lasagna, this was good. One of the better vegetable lasagna I've had, even if lacking in bechamel sauce. But the eggplant was soft and not soggy and the pumpkin's flavour was a good blend with the eggplant.Grilled kingfish collar with chinchalok chili; where is the chinchalok? Because I certainly can't taste them. Why not make a chincalok infused salad dressing instead?Pan-roasted vegetables with agilo olio pasta. There's certainly nothing pan roasted here. In fact, I was sure they're fresh (maybe sauteed mushroom) due to the overwhelming fresh green smell and just tossed with the aglio-olio pasta. No olive oil either here. Duck breast confit was just... no. Not memorable enough. The duck had no taste, the cherry compote tasted like turkey's prepacked cranberry sauce and the kechap manis impressively was not sweet (this is not a praise).Laksa Tagliatalle with Salmon had barely any laksa taste. And the salmon was 1 piece instead of 2 like in the picture. Banana donut; where's the banana? Ondeh ondeh cake; can't taste the pandan nor the gula melaka, at least the cream was a mix of whipped and clotted cream.I can barely tell that those food are fusion. Not when I can't taste anything defining in them. The chinchalok failed to give any taste, and surprisingly, so is the laksa sauce. The only defined taste was from the fried silverfish from the salad.The table was small, the plates were huge, the portion of food was tiny, and the order took too long to appear. At least the staff was attentive enough to not ignore raised hands. After all these, we were still hungry and had to go to McD. It was rather galling; especially after we ordered 5 dishes, 1 salad and 2 dessert for those kind of price
4
Loving the pork floss truffle fries and pork pops. Truffle fries don't turn soggy that fast, portion was just right. Pork pops are fried marinated pork belly dipped with mango sauce, which give a refreshing taste. Teh Halia creme brulee is special, ginger taste is not very overpowering
4
At this restaurant, you get to taste dishes with an interesting local twist to western cuisine! For example PRAWN & ‘HAE BI HIAM’ PASTA, which is Tagliatelle tossed with housemade spicy shrimp paste, sakura ebi and sauteed prawns! I happen to try their TRUFFLE MUSHROOM SOUP and NEW ENGLAND FISH & CHIPS, also equally good! They also have ‘LUP CHEONG’ MACARONI & CHEESE....service tends to be slower when crowded and do make reservations, especially on a weekend
4
Food's great, awesome service and lovely ambience. To top it all, prices were reasonable! Had a great time with my partner for a Saturday dinner date. We had Grilled Beef with Chinchalok, Truffle Floss Fries and Hae Bee Hiam Pasta. All in all, 4/5 for all the items we've tried. Truffle Floss Fries is a MUST TRY! Thumbs up to RedPan
3
The food was delicious but the service could have been better. We had made a reservation and arrived on time. While we were sitting down to study the menu, my sister who was on the aisle kept getting bumped by people walking behind her. We asked a server if we could change our seat to the table beside which was empty (but reserved for another customer who has not arrived). The server was reluctant and after walking away to discuss with his colleagues, he came back to suggest for our table to be shifted closer to the empty table so that we might not get bumped again. When we rejected this useless suggestion, he told us that, if it is this case, then the customer who will arrive soon will also get bumped sitting there. Seriously, the key concern should be to resolve our issue but it seems like he was more concerned about the customer satisfaction of customers who have not arrived when the customer might not even face the same situation as us. He could have resolved our issue first and then work on the table layouts however he wanted. The situation was too ridiculous and we insisted on changing our seats nevertheless. Thankfully, the food made up for the questionable service. We really enjoyed the lup cheong mac n cheese and white sangria
5
The staff are friendly and the food is good as usual! my friends and I are pleasantly pleased! must try their truffle floss fries! its one of my favourites!
4
The modernized bak ku teh was special. The prawn pasta was a bit salty though. Overall, had a good experience
4
1st time at redpan. Food was interesting and generally above average. However, the foie gras was over cooked.
3
Recommended food was overrated while food that SHOULD be recommended was side-lined. Beef dishes was too hard...
3
It was great value overall $56.50 for the following inclusive of 10% service charge: 1. Tuck shop fried chicken wings2. Lup Cheong mac & cheese3. Ha bi hiam & prawn pasta4. Matcha Roll5. Strawberry Basil sodaThe Mac & cheese was a let down as it was dry and hard, wasn't creamy or slightly wet as expected. The pasta was quite a nice local twist. We loved the tuck shop fried chick wings which were nicely marinated, tangy and finger licking delicious. The matcha roll was a winner too! Nice soft with strong matcha taste and flavour!
3
Came here for lunch today and opted for the tomato soup to start with and the vegetable lasagna for main. The soup was decent but the lasagna was a bit oily and generally not that special. Of more concern was that the mains were delivered only a few minutes after the starters, and so were slightly cold by the time we started eating them. Overall I'd say this place was ok, but I probably won't be rushing back
4
First time at redpan for dinner gathering. And here's my review...Food Quality and Taste: (based on individual's preference)I must say that their menu is very creative. Infused with local flavors. We ordered quite a few items off the menu. Truffle Mushroom Soup - Nothing can go wrong with this soup. Creamy and smooth texture. Truffle taste is not overpowering.Truffle Floss Fries - 2 Thumbs upPrawn & Hae Bi Hiam Pasta - It's really good! Now we know pasta goes well with hae bi hiam! It's not too creamy and the spice of the hae bi hiam is just at the right note.Steak with Chinchalok - We were adventurous enough to explore this main. It's good. The taste of chinchalok made the steak more appetizing. It will be even better if the kitchen got the doneness right. We ordered medium but it was served medium well.Kung Pao Chicken Salad - This is a current promotional item on the standee. We are rating this 4.5 out of 5. Worth a try!Overall Experience:We enjoyed the ambience and the food served at redpan. Serving portion is just right. We will be back to try other dishes soon
4
Late reservations on Fri night & booking was confirmed on the spot. On the actual day we reached half an hour earlier but we are able to enter. Since I am not the first time there so I don't really need any recommendations (the waiter will ask whether you need any recommendations). We ordered for sharing and the foods & drinks came in an acceptable timing. Overall dining experience is pleasant & I will be going back again for gathering in near future. Thanks ^
4
Hubby and I stumbled across this restaurant and decided to give it a try. Compliments to the chef for taking local flavours to a higher level. We tried the Hae bee pasta, smoked tomato soup & beer sirloin with satay sauce. All were good except the beef needed more satay sauce. The tea halia creme brulee was not too bad too. Would definitely go again
3
Redpan Restaurant is only newly opened; the cuisine is a contemporary modern with local and western twist, with an average taste. Service was pleasant and timely. It seems that the signature dish may be The Hae Bi Hiam Pasta it is a crowd-favourite. Staff seemed pleasant and friendly and attentive and well informed. Overall a Good night. Would go again in a few monthsâ€™ time
