I would give it a 4 stars for its prices and reasonable food standard. Do not expect too much as it is a HDB restaurant. Restaurant need to revamp and improve its surrounding cleanliness as it is very old and look dark at some areas.

Came here on a weekend with relatives and enjoyed their buffet set. It was copious in quantity and definitely great value for money. The ingredients used must be of a reasonable standard, the seafood all seemed fresh and didn't raise any suspicions.Highly recommend making a booking. Also, it can get quite noisy when it's packed, so probably not ideal for an intimate conversation type of mea

There are 2 set meals and they are priced on a per pax basis. There was an S$18.90 price and a S$27.90 price. Hope I got that right. You do get a very delectable shark's fin as part of the pricier menu. The taste was great and the variety wide enough for lunch. Wish I had taken down more notes but I was at a business lunch so I had to pay attention to the conversation. Will definitely be back and this time with family. very short walk from MRT station at Boon Ken

We went as a family of five for the lunch buffet, and even though my children are young, they are charged at adult prices because they are above 1.2 m. Yup, this restaurant goes by height rather than by age.Food is good. The children like several dishes, such as fried chicken drumlets, hotplate toufu and the dessert dishes. The fried rice and yee fu noodles came piping hot, and do not contain a lot of MSG. Buffet choices were plenty. I think there is at least 30 dishes to choose from. And we ordered only around 10 or so.At $16.80 per adult for lunch, this is worth a visit. We had a good time chatting with one of the waitresses as there wasn't many patrons for lunch. The service is good, contrary to feedback from visitors at Hungrygowhere.Will visit again in future

Bendemeer area always had good Teochew restaurants so had a hunger pang for goose and Hei zhou aka Prawn rolls, oyster omellete and fried mee sua. The one I grew up - Guan Hin has moved. OK decor looks tired but service is very attentive and food quality is up to par for most dishes. The crayfish with egg yolk smelled really tasty but my guest got ill that night but the both of us was fine. We suspect it could be the oyster in the oyster omelette or it could be just coincidence that he had already picked up a bad virus from previous meals. The crayfish dish was expensive. I had second thought of not ordering seafood but my guest wanted to taste what Teochew cuisine was. Would recommend to stay away from fresh seafood unless you want to blow your budget. For a place located at the heartlands, the prices are steep. The upside is there is no service charge but i think it's all build-in

For this year's Mother Day, we decided to head out to Ban Heng. The 8-course dinner cost us $398++. We were amazed by the suckling pig portion. It was so huge that we cannot finish! Shark fin soup was really starchy hence not so appealing. Fried fish was small in portion too. Feel that the price is not worth what we have eaten.

Our group of ten had lunch at this restaurantand savoured the following dishes ... Cold DishPlatter, Sharkfin soup, Fried Fish In Superior SoyaSauce, Mixed Vegetables, Fried Chicken, SaltedEgg Prawns, Ee Fu Noodles & Orh Nee ( yam pastewith gingko nuts).The standard of cooking is good. My picks of the betterdishes are : The cold dish platter, Fried fish in soya sauce,& the salted egg prawns.The fish was fesh but though the salted egg prawns featuredjumbo prawns, the salted egg sauce though creamy, was sweetthat the salted egg taste did come come through.The service was prompt & attentive despite poor reviews in thepast.The restaurant still retains its old fashion charm befitting a 40 oddyears history.This restaurant is very conveniently located next to Boon Keng MRTStation.Overall food rating : 6 out of 10 points
