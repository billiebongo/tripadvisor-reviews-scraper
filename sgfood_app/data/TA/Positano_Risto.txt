Was there as part of a group of 9. Food was delicious and service staff were attentive professional. Recommend the squid ink pasta, baked chicken, the mac and cheese and the pizzas. Well worth a return visit
5
It is worth visiting! I felt like I am eating pizza in Venice :)By they way, awesome and polite staff

It was a busy Saturday night and no reservations were made. Yet, the waiter tried his best to find the two of us a spot somewhere. I was recommended to dine here by a Friend who swore by its service. She had the opportunity to meet the owner Uncle Imran himself. As for my Best Friend and I, we were warmly greeted by Aunty Kamilah, Uncle Imran’s Wife. Lovely woman she is. The ambience is cosy. The food is nice. The price is affordable. But nothing Beats the service by the Waiters and Waitresses there. It felt like dining in a relatives place. We had the prawn aglio, chicken wings, calamari and the chocolate lave cake which is to die for. Might just head on there again tonight. Recommended

Upon reaching the diners was greeted warmly by Imran, he showed us to our table and handed us the menu. It was a cosy Italian dining place.. We looked thru the menu with some lovely stories of how the place was setup, who are the owners and the history of the town where the name of the restaurant was called “Positano”. After looking thru the menu, these are items that we ordered: Wild mushroom soup which was blended nicely made with original ingredients garnished with Olive oil on the top.Baked potato skin which was also served at a right portion.Popcorn shrimp was great, it was a delightful taste of freshly peeled shrimp coated with a crispy batter served with three different kinda sauces (spicy, sweet and sour)which are homemade.Eggplant Parmigiana was beautifully served on a round plate garnished with olive oil.Margherita pizza was thin crust, perfect for two served simply with tomato sauce and cheese.Panna cotta was made with perfection, well blended and smooth. (Dessert)Nojito was a refreshing blend of lime, mint leaves and soda water.(Drink)Scarlet O’harra was nice concoction of fruit drink that’s not too sweet.Overall food served are well balanced with the right servings for two. Staffs are friendly, attentive and professional when attending to guest. In between our meal, we were approached by Imran & Ishak whom are the owners of the fine Italian dining asking us of our food served.. Both of them ensures us and made us feel important. All the dishes pricing is reasonable. Will definitely come back to dine at Positano & recommend others to try

The food was awesome and really good quality. The owners and staffs were really friendly and humble and really appreciative of us patronising the restaurant. Will definitely return again

Everything was perfect in this restaurant. Lets start with service. It was impeccable. Was greeted by the owner. Very friendly. I was with my wife and daughter. First thing the restaurant manager did was to help carry the pram to the second floor as I was carrying my bag and daughter.I came to this restaurant because of the video on Have Halal Will Travel. I was really surprise at the authencity of the food. The black squid ink pasta was one of the best I tasted and the mac and cheese was superb! I am a Mac and Cheese fan and when I say its superb, I kid you not. I've travel quite a bit around the world and I must say, I am quite a fan of this restaurant. Really hard to find a Halal authentic Italian restaurant.The ambience was good and the owner came up and chat with us. I felt like I was overseas where owners of restaurant tends to walk up to customers and have a chat. I am impressed and definitely will drop by to taste other food.Overall, 5 star experience. Food was superb, service excellent, owner extremely friendly and engaging, ambience was nice
5
Great Italian food, friendly staff and lovely ambience. A place where you'll be back again to try the rest of the menu.

The food is absolutely fantastic and delicious! From the appetizers to the mains and especially the desserts! There is a lot of variety in their menu too. In our group, some of us are pescatarian and vegetarian and we were happy to find that there are lots of options to choose from. We loved every single dish that we ordered.Personally, I love the pizzas the most. The crust was perfect! They were not too thick or too thin. We had the Four Cheese and Positano Signature Calzone pizzas. It was so yummy that we ordered a second round of these pizzas as they were very delicious.Their desserts were heavenly too! We had the Chocolate Lava Cake, the Creme Brulee and the Panna Cotta with Mixed Berries. All three are so delectable, it is hard to choose a favourite! I would definitely recommend all but if I really had to choose one, it would be the Panna Cotta. It is absolutely divine - not too sweet, so soft and smooth, and it melts in your mouth. Thinking of it now is making my mouth water.I am definitely coming back to Positano Risto! It has the best halal, authentic Italian food with great ambience and an excellent service crew
5
A friend shared with me their video on Have Halal Will Travel. It’s so rare to find Italian and Halal restaurants anywhere, even in my hometown KL. Was there for lunch on Feb 10th, had their beef pepperoni pizza and panna cotta which were ridiculously good! CHAMPION! *tears of joy* The staff were nice and welcoming. Had a good chat with the owner (or one of the owners) too :) . Will definitely drop by again the next time I visit Singapore.
5
had our dinner at positano risto & we ordered the chicken wings for a starter.heard the pizza was delicious...so we ordered 2 pizzas ( 4 cheese & positano signature calzone). The pizza was quite big for the 2 of us.haha! its very yummylicious.great friendly staff & the owner was very friendly too. will come again to try the pasta
5
Great location to begin with, it is not situated along the quiet lanes. Excellent staff services, my mom and I had great chat with one of the owners and he shared the story behind his business. We ordered the Ribeye, Crabmeat Linguini, Baked Potato Skins and Smoked Salmon Salad (not stating the exact names from the menu but you get my drift, yeah?) I have just one word to describe my experience with Positano; spectacular. I will definitely go back with my family again for their pizza and desserts. Thank you Positano for the warm hospitality. I will see you again.
5
Being Europeans we are quite demanding when it comes to Italian food. But this restaurant made us want to go back there.In Arab street in Singapore many of the restaurant workers are quite 'aggressive' trying to invite more guests to have a meal in their restaurant. We were kind of impressed that the owner of Positano presented his food in a very polite way giving us 'freedom' to decide by ourselves...We made great decision and enjoyed amazing food. I still remember the texture of the pizza, the light taste of pasta, and amazing texture and taste of chocolate lava. Oh, yes their juices were also very nice.Fresh food, well-prepared food, served with respect and friendliness - it is worthy to treat yourself with this experience. Thank you Positano team! E and 
5
Had a good time. Good food. Good ambience. Hospitable people. Kudos!! Try out the risotto, pizzas and pastas. Love them.
5
My girls and I had a great experience during our visit there recently. We were welcomed with awesome hospitality by staffs, manager as well as the owner. We had a hard time choosing our food but when we did, we enjoyed our food so much especially the MacNCheese(its their recommended & most popular dish)! Even my kid loves it. And oh, they actually provided some coloring activity for the kids to occupy themselves. Thanks for the awesome service, Team
5
Awesome food, nice dining ambience. Really love and enjoy that Fettuccini Arragosta that serve with a Fresh Whole Lobster. My girls have the Prawn Aglio and hubby have the Ribeye not missed their signature Pizza..Good hospitality
5
Choices of food were great and fresh, reasonable price rates.Great ambience and hospitality was amazing.Keep up the great wor

Me and my husband had a fantastic experience at Positano Risto. The owners and the staff were super friendly to us. The service was excellent.It is a cute restaurant. First we had a very tasty while mushroom soup. After that I had a very delicious classical spaghetti bolognaise . My husband had a very good burger. We also had some good coffee there. We wanted to try some deserts but we were too full. Before we were leaving Singapore stopped by one more time just to have some quick bite before our flight. We had some pizza what was good. It is a different style what we used to but it was fresh with nice ingredients. I would recommend this nice restaurant to anyone. If I come back to Singapore I would definitely come back to eat here. I really like and appreciate nice people like the owners and his family. Their hearts are in this restaurant and passionate about making good food

Had dinner here with a group of friends on a weekday and great that there's ample parking near the restaurant. 6 of us, we had truffle fries, eggplant, 3 pizzas,1 signature calzone, 3 pastas and desserts n We left with our stomach so full & happy! I can understand why this restaurant is so new and have already gotten such good reviews!Truffle fries was nicely done with fresh Parmesan cheese shavings..Must try items are the pizzas! The crust is soooo good..thin, crispy n have a nice texture to it..I guess u can choose the pizza according to the topping u like as the crust is good..we have pepperoni which is good, the calzone is a must try as it's not the typical calzone..and I understand that the burrata cheese is house made by the chef..if u want to order the four season, I would suggest asking the server if u can have the toppings mixed together instead of separated individually..Pasta was good too! Arrabiata was done nicely and if u love spicy, go for the squid ink! Mac & cheese was good too, it's good for sharing as it may be too rich if eaten as a meal on ur own.What a shame, we didn't manage to take any pic at all! I guess the food was so good that we jus started digging in whenever the food came! This is a halal restaurant and I didn't felt that I missed out anything except the alcohol which after dinner, you can walk around the area to digest and there are few bars around for drinks.Overall was a nice casual warm restaurant. Service was prompt and excellent. Owners are very friendly and warm. I will definitely be back to try other dishes and also to take away the pizza!
5
Unexpectedly had the best pizza I’ve eaten in Singapore at any price range. Crispy thin crust. Great pasta as well. Fun ambiance w great posters. Will definitely be back!
5
The pizza has a chewy flavorful thin crust. You get a 3 sauce platter of sweet, sour and spicy olive oil to mix with your food to suit your tastebuds. The best mushroom rissotto ever....yes..licked the plate!!
5
Full of character and an Almafi welcome, this small Italian trattoria glows amongst many middle eastern restaurants. A simple menu that boasts with pride recipes that work.Great position for an evening stroll and Italian meal
5
Arriving to an area back in time but with more vibrant feel & wonderful ambiance what we experience was PHENOMINAL! The glorious food served beautifully presented was already "seduction'' to our senses & awaken our gastronomic urge. We started with Eggplant Parmigiana & my eyes responded in sync with my tastebuds at once! Mac Cheese with Crab Meat came after & it jolted me with pleasure I had not had for awhile [food wise ;) ] - absolutely DELIZIOSO!!! Anything after that better be 'scaling up the chart' & it did - Prawn Aglio Olio, Lamb Ravioli, Signature Calzone & noticing our enthusiam we were pleasantly suprised when the owners served us a non menu 2 types of Margherita Pizzas after hearing I love margherita & they were all heavenly! Topping it up Panna Cotta dessert - Saluto! Try their mocktails too you will enjoy. Complimenting are the Great Excellent service we all expect. Warmth, attentive, superb! Grazie to all of you for bringing us down memory lane, to Italy & beyond.Teleporting Experience
5
Food was top notch! Everything from the pizzas to pastas was cooked to perfection! Their crab mac and cheese and panna cotta is a must have! Overall restaurant had a very cosy feel and staff was very accomodating and hospitable! Thank you for a lovely evening and kudos to the team
5
It was my third time at this restaurant today - definitely a must try if you’re in the area!Owners are super friendly and took the time to share their story of how the restaurant came to be; vibe is casual and unpretentious. Prices are very reasonable with pizzas and pastas below $20, and meats just a bit more.It’s definitely one of the best Italian food I’ve had - in and out of Italy.
5
Great food, great service! Well done guys. Service folks went the extra mile to ensure a great dining experience, helps that the quality of food served are top notch too
5
I’ve been here three times with family and friends in about a week! We had the lamb shank, Mac & Cheese, Squid ink Pasta (YUM!), various pizzas, Lasagne, Lobster, Creme Brûlée, Panna Cotta & Lava Cake. The food is a labour of love; beautifully presented and delicious. (Note: Didn’t manage to take pics of all the dishes we had).The ambience is cheerful with a hint of background music & the staff are ever so friendly, prompt & attentive. The owners personally visit tables to enquire how we liked the food & service - awesome to see such commitment to food quality & hospitality. We had an amazing gastronomical experienceTHANK YOU! What can I say? “When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, THAT’S AMORE!”❤️ We’ll be back for mor
5
We simply enjoyed the food and the hospitality! Bravo to the team! We will surely come back! Thumbs up! I just love the restaurant owners and their staff. Service was excellent! I can just go on and on about their hospitality and service! It was really "Fantastico" We will surely patronise there again" Kamilah, you go girl! Love the way your husband and you entertained us
5
Positano never fails to impress my friends and I, and our tummies! Great ambience, great food, great location, and great hosts too! Definitely will be coming back here again
2
Had their seafood marinara and lasagne..both were very disappointing. Pasta was not aldente and overcooked whereas the sauce was too sweet! The mussels weren’t fresh ones but frozen. The lasagne has the most ridiculous & queer taste to it; prominent onion flavour in the lasagne sauce that was so off putting! So never will we ever go back there to dine
5
The atmosphere gave great vibes. I enjoyed the food with its delicious flavour as well as its extensive repertoire of dishes. Service was great, the staff were very accommodating and I had very little issue with the whole experience. I would definitely recommend eating here :
5
I had a wonderful time. The ambience is very calming, the food was delicious and the staff were very accomodating. A very pleasant experience :
4
We went for dinner and the restaurant was very accommodating. The hosts were very nice people. It was pricy but the food was very good
5
The owners were there to greet us the moment we came in. Very friendly staff. Food was very good. Prices were very reasonable too. Would definitely come back to enjoy the rest of the menu

My family and I had a lovely dinner celebrating my brother’s birthday and we greatly appreciate the warm hospitality. Staffs including the owner hosted us well, ambience was nice, food quality was great and nothing seem to fall short throughout our dining experience. Will definitely come back for another round of good food!
5
It is a true Italian food which is sooo nice, perfect and authentic. The service is superb, nice ambience and friendly owners..
5
Chanced upon this newly opened space up at Bussorah Street and did not disappoint! Ita Mushroom risotto was just nice. I love my mushrooms and this just hit the spot for me. Spent our dinner chatting w the ever so friendly owner Ms Kamilah and we felt more at home. If you ever think of coming by pls try the Panna Cotta! I shared mine w my partner and it wasnt enough but our time was short so it sufficed for now. Will definitely be coming back!! - no pix cuz we were too hungry
5
Alhamdulillah, had an awesome dining experience with my kiddies last night. Food quality was excellent, service staff and the owners were so friendly and warm. Definitely will be back to taste the other dishes. Kudos to Positano Risto May 2018 be a prosperous year for you
5
Fabulous Italian food and wonderful service! You wouldn’t think that a halal Italian restaurant would serve such authentic Italian fare. I have lunched here 3 times and every visit has been a gastronomically-satisfying experience
5
Our second visit. Dinner this time. Enjoyable experience! Attentive and friendly service from the waiting staff of Positano Risto. Delicious food, good music and ambience. A place to visit with friends, family and children
4
The ambience is cozy and relaxing. Great service by friendly management and staff. Meals are tasty and HALAL! Looking forward to the set lunch menu..
5
My friend & I had a happy & pleasurable dinner at this quaint and clean restaurant. Menu had a really good range. Service was truly tip top - attentive from the time I was greeted to paying the bill. The staff knew the menu well & recommended dishes to us, as it was our first time here. Amazing food indeed! Authentic, delicious & most satisfying! The desserts were simply divine too! The dinner experience was enhanced even more with greetings from owner, Imran & his wife, Kamilah.I will definitely be coming back for more...with family & more friends!

My wife and I had a dinner on sunday evening and we really enjoyed.To start, the staff is very friendly and we felt welcome. We ordered some pizzas ans it was really good, the dough was nice (which is very important for a pizza). I recommend the four cheeses, so good !!The location is great, just near the Sultan Masjid, and the street is lively.And one more positive point : it's halal ! It's difficult to find italian halal food in Singapore ans this one is nice.For sure, I will go bac

Celebrated my friend's birthday over here and love the experience which I have encountered. The food was awesomely good, I would recommend crabmeat linguini and mac and cheese. I will definitely go back to try other dishes
5
Went to have dinner with my best friends to celebrate my birthday. We had a wonderful experience while we were there. Their service is just superb and their staff are super friendly and attentive. Kudos to them! We didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive and it was just simply delicious, especially their Mac and Cheese with Crab Meat. And their prices are reasonable. We would strongly recommend a visit. From Mala, Jo, Serene, Aven and Le
5
Went to Positano to celebrate a friend's baby shower and has a pleasant experience there, The staff allowed us to put up very simple, non-restrictive decorations and were very polite and helpful where required. The food was really good and the portion was filling. They even gave a free dessert to celebrate the occasion. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a delightful dining experience. Definitely will come back again very soon
5
Found this restaurant while looking for vegetarian food in the area and it was a wonderful find. Staff are just lovely without being pushy like most in the area and the food was delicious. We had the mushroom risotto and the lamb ragu pasta. Both were yum! My husband said it was the best risotto he'd ever had.A must try is the cheesecake for dessert. It's made by hand from scratch which is obvious from the first amazing bite. For A1 Italian food in Singapore at affordable prices this is the place
5
The staffs and owners of the place were really nice and attentive. From the moment we were seated till we left the place, it was nothing short of impeccable service. The portions were pretty big. We ordered the Truffle Fries and Popcorn Shrimp for appetizers. Loved both of them, but the popcorn shrimp isn't anything special- still delicious tho.As for mains, we ordered the Positano Mac & Cheese with Crab Meat, that was their signature dish, and I must say, my friends & I had a taste of that and we can't help going, "mmmm oh my goddd... that's good!". It's no wonder that is their signature dish. The Fettucine Carbonara is very creamy and seasoned just right. We cleaned that off the plate! And we also got the Hawaiian Pizza and Positano Classic Burger. Loved the Hawaiian Pizza too! But the Classic Burger was a bit of a miss. The meat was too overcooked. It would be great if it was cooked medium instead of well-done. Overall, my friends and I had a wonderful time at Positano. I would totally return. Good food, great service, what's not to like? :
5
One of the owners visited a small Italian town and was inspired by its beauty and the inspiring story of how it treated its sole Muslim resident. Thus Positano became the name of a cosy restaurant which serves not just great food but dishes out a nice and casual social dining experience - at a very reasonable price. It does not have a very long menu, which allows the team to focus on ensuring each dish is special, according to Ishak, one of the founders - who is always there to ensure the food, ambience and service is just they way the owners envision it. We tasted the Ribeye (succulent, texture just right and taste - I ate it without the sauce - was really good), the arrabiata (my favourite among the handmade pastas - spicy without overpowering the accompanying flavours), prawn alio oglio (nice herbal taste, tasty sun-dried tomatoes and generous servings of prawns done just right) and crabmeat linguini (crab meat was fresh and the crab flavour permeated the pasta, slightly spicy). The crabmeat mac and cheese seemed out of place in the menu so we did not order but Ishak insisted we try it. I dont particularly like creamy pastas but this one was indeed special. I would strongly recommend a visit
5
Went to Positano to celebrate my husbandâ€™s birthday, and we were very pleased with the service. The service crews were very attentive to our needs! The food was flavourful and I would say were pretty authentic. Absolutely loved the squid ink pasta and the lava cake!Kamilah and Imran - the owners - came up to us to have a chat. They told us a bit about the food and their story and even gave us some recommendations for our next visit. Will see you soon, insyaAllah!
5
Beautifully done. The pizza is cheesy and lovely. The settings is cool. Very nice place to chill and relax with family. And the food... Super Deliciousooooooo!!!
5
Really good Quattro Formagi pizza that will make me drool in my mind. Handmade to the true Italian way with generous servings of the 4 different cheese.The Eggplant Pamersan is equally good. Good food in a nice settings tucked in a fantastic location
5
Wonderful service and great food! The pumpkin puree for infants was just lovely as this is the first time I've been to an establishment that is very baby friendly! The pizzas are highly recommended, the crust and fillings complements each other, really taste like the ones we had in Italy. We will definitely be back
5
lovely food, the first time i dropped in i couldnt not decide on pastas or pizzas or a good piece of steak or a lamb rack. I've been there twice already and very satisfied with the quality of food and price for an italian resto. especially one that is right smack in the middle of vibrant arab street. if i had to choose one italian resto to head to..this would be it! p.s this place is halal and family friendly - we held a birthday gathering on the top floor and had to make reservations in advance which the staff was very happy to cater to
5
Sounds unassuming, but definitely a must have. It was perfection! Luscious and flavorful with every bite. Even though I had to eat it slowly as I was also feeding my toddler, the risotto was still beautiful! So much love went into this dish. I may end up ordering this every time I go to Positano. This dish is truly a testament to the authenticity of Positano's Italian cooking
5
I don’t always post about food, but when I do, I prefer Pizza Margherita at Positano Risto. Stay hungry, my friends. Because this is the first pizza I’ve eaten in Singapore that reminded me of the ones in Italy. #legit #theyhiredanitalian #takenbymywife #givingmywifecredi
5
We have been here a couple of times and each time I would force my husband to get a different dish so that I can reward my tastebuds to more variety of awesome food. THE PIZZAAAAAAAAAA especially. #legit #ilove #willgoagai
5
Wow!This Restaurant has been one of the highlights of our trip. Not only for the amazing food but also for the amazing customer service, and the story behind Positano Risto. The whole dining experience is like being on a journey from Elbert Einstein quotes to ones Personal Touch.Very rare do you find the owner of the restaurant come and talk to you, such a humble guy.It was a pleasure meeting you Imran. You made our last day very memorable.We will definitely be back in the new year!As such we did make it back, today being the 4th Jan 18! The food again did not disappoint and customer service is exceptional.Highly recommend the chicken wings for starters, regardless whatever you order is all made with TLC.
5
Delicious food, excellent service and great value. In the words of my child, the pizza was "more than too yummy". Unique and absolutely delicious with a crispy crust that is rare to find. Child friendly place too...my child got a nice selection of activities to keep busy while we waited for the meal. Every dish we ordered was delicious.Would definitely go again
5
i've been back a number of times already and for obvious reasons! the food is so good and they've recently expanded the menu to include more delicious must haves! The restaurant is very child-friendly providing colouring materials, children cutlery and kids menu which i really appreciate for my little one. Plus the staff and owners are so friendly and warm - makes it a lovely dining experience:
5
Had a fantastic dining experience on the eve of New Year’s at Positano Risto. Food quality was excellent, service staff were professional and pleasantly friendly. Definitely coming back again to try the new dishes.
5
I have been to this halal Italian restaurant more than 5 times since it opened less than 2 months ago and it never disappoints. I have tried the arrabiata, the ribeye, the baked salmon....all just sumptuous. The arrabiata is really spicy. I love their desserts. Creme brulee and pannacotta are my favorites as I can't eat chocolate so can't sample their lava cake which I've been told is yummy. I can quite honestly say that their pannacotta is the best that I've ever tasted. Better than in Italy. The best part is that it's quite rare to get great service in social restaurants in Singapore. And this one goes out of its way to make you want to come back. They just introduced a new menu and their new pizza selection is awesome. Had the margherita and wow...who gives you two flavors on Margherita? What's really nice is that there is also some birthday or special occasion going on at some table
4
In the reservation form online I indicated that I wanted a surprise dessert to celebrate my friend's birthday. The staff called me immediately and confirmed my booking as well as the surprise. It went as planned on that day and my friend enjoyed it. Also the owner and staff were very attentive to our needs. The overall service made it a very pleasant place to celebrate the last meal of new year's eve
5
Hats off to Positano Risto for their great customer service. The owners were such great hosts. The food that was served were scrumptous and well plated. The ambience was great. Thumbs up for Positano Risto, may 2018 be a properous year for you!
5
Very good Italian food and very friendly staff.Hope they will add pizza, will be back to taste the nee menu
5
Fabulous service,staff very attentive.Linguini and steak meals absolutely beautiful and fantastic prices. Well worth having a meal here, you will not be disappointed
5
Made a reservation yesterday to celebrate my husband's birthday and the service crew were really attentive in making it a wonderful surprise. Food-wise, they were so delicious. Notably the eggplant parmigiana (wished there were more in that serving) and for the mac and cheese, i couldnt finish it because it was a pretty hearty serving (could do with bigger morsels of crabmeat in my opinion to counter the cheese) but the star of the show was the aglio olio *a must try* and the tiramisu for dessert was perfect because it can be hard to find halal tiramisu here. We will definitely visit again and hope to explore the new menu for 2018 soon! 
5
Very great atmosphere, amazing food and very hospitable staff! I can’t wait to be back here and bring others. It’s halal as well!!
4
Introduced by my classmate to this recently opened restaurant at Kampong Glam neighbourhood. I’m not a big, hearty eater and will usually order the pasta dishes. We had a lunch gathering of 6 and would highlight the notable nibbles and mains: Grilled eggplant, Mac & Cheese, Prawn Aglio Olio Linguini.....the portion is large and tasty.However.....though not a big eater....at Italian restaurants, I usually cater some tummy space for desserts...we had delicious chocolate lava cake, Oreo lava tower as well the Creme Brûlée...pairs well with hot coffee. Must try!Spoke to the co-owner and understand currently it’s not a full menu and will introduce pizzas soon...I will definitely be back
5
Lovely dining experience with good food, great service and wonderful ambience. So thoughtful that they have an option for little babies. A have-to-go place for a wonderful family dining experience.
