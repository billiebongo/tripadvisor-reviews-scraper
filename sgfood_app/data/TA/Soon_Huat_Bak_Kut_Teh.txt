We ordered the Bak Kut Teh via Uber Eats for 2 person portion. Tasted good and quite a lot of ingredient in there. Price was reasonable too.

We frequent this place. Good bak kut teh and other side dishes. Try the dry bak kut teh if you want a change from the soup one. You can sometimes buy voucher or package from online group buy sites at good price

Finding a good bak kut teh in Singapore is always tricky. Glad to give this place a try and will surey come back. They have your usual you tiao, salted vegetables, peanuts, tao pok, etc. to go with our meal. Service is good and efficient.

The Bak Kut Teh here also comes in the dry version cooked with black sauce and salted fish slices. Very tasty and unique.

The food was fantastic – if you like Malaysia-style Bak Kut Teh with golden mushrooms, pig’s liver and stomach, this is the BKT for you. The soup was so tasty we drank it to its dregs. The trotters we ordered were lean (as far as trotters go!) and very meaty. Their dry BKT is delicious too, but a bit spicy so kids might not like it. It's a social enterprise that gives ex-inmates a second chance. A very meaningful place to dine in
