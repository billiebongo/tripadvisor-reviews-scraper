Food was alright and value for money. The service was excellent as well. Worth a visit back to the place.

Conducive ambience to have a group dinner/drink. Service by the restaurant was prompt. Provided our feedback on the food and were impressed that they took action immediately.

As the locals say "Die Die Must Try". I have been here a couple times in the past with colleagues enjoying Wine on Tap vast selection of wines, beers, other fine drinks as well as their succulent finger food.Now whilst the Otah, Chicken Wings, Grilled Beef and even their Laksa is very good, it's really not the type of food you feed your wife and teenagers for dinner.So tonight I brought the Family and we tried what I call the "WoT Tomahawk", weighing it at 1.8Kg the heavyweight was succulent, melted in your mouth and the light taste of the marinade, seemingly takes you to another place that instant the flavour hits your taste buds.Ok back on earth: Now whilst my carnivorous wife and teenage kids like Medium Rare, I can only stomach Medium, however this was no issue where Chef Ryan individually carves and torches the lean meat to an individual perfection.The Summary:Wine on Tap is not for Family dinners? Think Again... Die Die Must Try

My family and I celebrated my brother's birthday at Wine on Tap. We reserved the table on the third floor, and effectively had the entire third floor all to ourselves. The table can sit 6-8 comfortably, and the cushions and dim lighting make the space extremely cozy. We had a great time over the next few hours. The food, which is best described as local fusion, was very well executed, and we especially enjoyed the chicken wings, fries, steak, otah, balinese chicken and pasta goreng. There were many unique draft beers to choose from, as was the case with wines (bottle, carafe, glass, house pour all available). Because the food and drinks were so reasonably priced, we had plenty to eat and drink. J was so warm and helpful, as was his partner Tiger. Both of them made sure we were well taken care of throughout the night, including a special birthday surprise for my brother. The rest of the restaurant is also very cozy and charming, including a breezy outdoor space that also looks perfect for lounging the night away. We will definitely return to this special place

Chope app had a great 1-for-1 promo for mains. This made eating out much more affordable.I had a salmon steak (as usual); the portion was small in my opinion. If you eat more, go for the battered fish and chips.Ambience was cosy and being situated on the 2nd level of the shophouse made the experience more interesting. Service was prompt and friendly

I chanced upon Wine on Tap among its promotions & had the opportunity to visit on a weekday evening. Located in the culture-rich cluster of Kampong Glam, they offer a welcoming reprieve with cosy ambience & pretty little decor on the 2nd floor away from the hustle and bustle of the streets below. Much appreciated is the attentive and knowledgeable service from J as he knows his wares well in recommending the food & wines! The fusion cuisine were attractive & well executed, turning everyday dishes into tasty fun for the fam. Pricing is competitive with good value plus various promotions available; would make it a point to return again to conquer the rest of the menu

The house wine is nice & highly recommended! The boss is highly recommended & it did not make us down. The "pregnant" sotong is delicious & we have been surprised by this dish name ! We had repeated this order. The seafood pasta goreng is also yummy whereby we ordered two plate too. The salmon is fresh & tender & thick & of course is yummy with the sauce! Signature dish of Balinese prawn is also not to forget! Overall great experience & cosy feel for gathering

This is a small place close to Arab that I really love when I want to have a quiet evening with friends. The owner is extremely friendly and always offers tasting of different wines. Their wine on tap is of very good quality and only 9 dollars per glass. This is very good for wine brought from a wineyard in Italy. The owners picked the right place to get wine from.Will always be coming back unless they increase prices

Went to Wine on tap with a group of colleagues after work along beach road. It is along the old shop houses and was a good find! They offer good choices of beer, wine and alcohol. The starter such as Chicken wing and Truffle fries were good. For main course, the steak and chick thigh were good selection. They have a attic that can seat up to 8 people which is a great place to your own.BRTon

My usual Tuesday hangout right now. Cosy and friendly people everywhere. Love the food they served and I cannot eat mee goreng elsewhere anymore. The paste goreng is sooooo good. The chicken wing is one of best I tasted in a bistro. Ladies night on Tuesday means you just need to pay 18++ for free flow of Wine and beer

Don't get me wrong, this is a restaurant but it was so comfortable that it feels like I'm at a Friend place chilling out. Location - Tourist place but good place for local to hang out too. Near to either Bugis downtown or Nicoll Highway. Not difficult to identify (at level 2)Food - Fantastic food, good recommendation from hostPricing - Affordable and reason for the location, environment and ambience Service - The part I love the most! Honestly Singapore doesn't have any places that have good services but this place goes beyond, it's Fantastic The host is vey welcoming, place have aircon and outdoor. Good for small or large gathering. Great place for girls hangout or a friends gathering. Definitely recommended

Nice Food, good service, definitely a comfortable and pleasant place to relax after a hard day's work.I am surprised that this bistro is selling Paulaner and Japanese beer, my all time favourite beer...Try the Kampong Muar Otah, cod fish and steak.... Their fried chicken wings is tasty. Will definitely be back again with friends and colleagues

We were shopping for artisan textile at Arab St and then it started to rain. Amidst the many shops was this unassuming looking "Wine On Tap" bar. We decided to seek shelter. The ambience was surprisingly cosy and warmth. Boon the owner was really friendly and welcoming.We had the house special chicken wings and some snacks, with beer and wine. It appeared that there were some regular customers who seem to know the place and the owner well. In a crowded city like Singapore, it is rare to find a place that you can relax, away from the frenzy of work. Will certainly return again

Love the relaxing environment.With good wine on hand, great food, great company ..What else do you need after a Long Hard Day of Trading the Forex Market !!

We had a pasta dish for dinner and wanted to order a sparkling wine but they don't have it in their menu. For goodness sake, don't advertise yourself that you "SERVE ALL WINE BY GLASS"! Service was not attentive enough. Furthermore the pasta dish doesn't add any good impression either. Shouldn't called themselves "Wine on Tap", so disappointing
5
An unassuming place from the outside, you have to go inside to discover this cosy decor with a great alfresco dining area. The hosts are always friendly and they provide great service. I had the steak and it was FANTASTIC. Definitely a must try. Gonna go there more often from now on

Beautiful ambience and cosy place to hang out with friends.Hidden treasure on a busy street.Food is fantastic especially the BBQ squid and cheese platter. A good selection of Wine with reasonable price for wine lovers. Excellent service and friendly staff who are attentive to our needs.Will definitely come back again.

Tuesday's ladies night at an affordable price. The chicken wings are a must try here. Would definitely come again

Excellent food and service, cosy & charming ambience... great place to chill, a simply delectable experience ‚ú®
Highly recommended üëçüèª

Very cosy place!!! Excellent service!!! I'll come back for the fresh juicy cod fish, the kampong-styled otah and the applause-winning chicken-wings again!!! üëçüëçüëç

Bar is very new, you should hit it before it is known to the world as a decent watering-hole.Although the exterior of Wine on Tap is deceivingly humble, the decor on the 2nd floor was cozy and exudes warmth. One can easily snag the corner table and hold their conversations in relative peace and quiet. My family and I dined in the 2nd floor roof top garden. Very serene and private place to just be.They also have this cozy loft with a horigotatsu (a cavity in the floor with a table over it for guests to sit on the floor with their feet resting in the cavity) above the 2nd floor that seems perfect for hosting a get-together of 7 or 8.Overall loved the place.P.S. forgot to take pictures of the place itself but maybe you should just pay a visit and find out

Awesome place to hang out and chill with Friends. Food was great. The atmosphere was great. The owner is very nice and friendly to us. Love the chicken wings and the otah. Definitely a place that I will come again

I came here with different groups of friends. This place is indeed suitable for all group size. From a gathering of over 10 people to just chill out with a friend, this is an ideal place to chill with good ambience and excellent service. The food is so good, my friends and I have become repeat customers.

My mother and I wanted a spot for a beer while we were out for a walk. We were greeted by Tiger out front of the restaurant who quickly arraganged a table outside and suggested a beer and a dessert. The selection of Japeneese craft beers and large wine list allowed us to find something that suited our tastes. The prices were very reasonable! We enjoyed the chocolate mouse at Tigers suggestion and were not disappointed, it was presented beautifully and was rich in taste! It's a shame we only found this spot on our last night in Singapore. The service was great, the beers cold and the conversation engaging. We will definitely be back next time we are in Singapore for a proper meal

It's a great place to chill after a long day at work in one of Singapore's tourist area. We ordered the mousse cake with ice cream which is a perfect match for our white wine. In addition we also experience an excellent customer service. We will definitely come back with our colleagues and friends next time. TGIF indeed! ‚ù§

My first today and definitely coming again and recommending to friends. The food is awesome, beverages and alcoholic stuff. Ambience is fantabulous especially the loft seating. Such a great place to hangout with friends, family and small gatherings. Boss Jo and Tiger are extremely personal, attending to our needs. This is a must-come!!

Walked pass Sat night after F1. Nice chill out place as I was sitting outdoor. Had a red wine ( wine on tap ) from tap. Something new to me as not from a bottle. Nice wine. Was recommended to have pumpkin soup. Great taste with smooth texture. Will sure go again.
