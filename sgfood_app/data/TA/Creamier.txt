Love the ice creams at creamier, not forgetting the waffles! Always a joy to head down to Creamier for their ice cream. For a chill night, the one at Labrador is really nice!!
Can‚Äôt wait to return for more this month!
5
The ice cream is one of my Boy favorite!! Problem is that it is usually so full that we can‚Äôt find a seat.. waffles are the best!!
4
Light crisp waffles paired with any of the ice creams are a must. Recommend the sea salt and the pistachio especially. Can get really crowded on weekends though, so don‚Äôt expect to get a seat fast
3
I love the whole combination of the waffles and ice cream. Unfortunately seating is a problem if a group is more than 4.
5
If you looking for cheap & good, here is a Nice place to chilled out with family and friends. For parking it is easy, for public transport like bus or MRT, may need to walk.
5
Well that's a find. Big choice of hand crafted ice creams. Ciders, coffee. Very very very tasty. Ice cream üç¶ ice cream üç¶ ice cream üç¶ ‚ô•Ô∏èüëçüèº
5
High turnover of patrons and friendly good service by the staff. Unique flavors with ordinary labels. Nothing overrated and will definitely visit again!Love the Earl Grey Lavender flavor which brings a unique taste blend. Not too much not too sweet...just simply nice and enjoying much with pleasure. Feeling very relax and a good experienced for tge first visit. Will come again!
5
Velvety ice cream... my fav is Sea salt Gula Melaka ...sweet and salty Flavours fight it out in your mouth...leaving a heavenly experience one will never forget... having tried several other versions ...have to say ...this the best...after that you will crave for more! Great job...Creamier ...
5
The icecream and waffles is amazing here. Especially the earl grey lavender icecream. However, the place gets pretty crowded and you may not be able to get a seat. So come early if you wanna dine in. Or else just buy icecream in a cone and enjoy it along the way!

While they have my favourite chocolate ice cream in all of Singapore (my ice cream crazy wife also finds Creamier to be her favourite ice cream parlour for the non-chocolate flavours as well), I am extremely disappointed at the quality of the thin foam bags they provide for the takeaway pints.Other competitors would invest a little more with insulating bags (often made of thicker paper/foil hybrid variants) and some even provide dry ice... This cost-cutting measure means that customers living further would want to give the takeaway a miss, which is truly a pity. But I guess they want customers to eat the scoops at the shop for more handsome profit margins
5
The salted gula Melaka is incredible, superb, amazing, unbelievable and hits the ultimate spot of comfort food!
5
Pretty crowded on Sun around 2pm.. Ordered the Roasted Pistachio with and it didn't disappoint!! Not too milky to my liking and with bits of pistachios üòãüòãüòã will come again to try other flavours!!
5
The MUST go place for ice cream in Singapore. My personal favorite is Gula Melaka n Sea Salt. Gula Melaka is brown sugar. Imagine blending sweetness n saltiness in your mouth...the contrasting taste fights for your attention ...it's an explosion of sensation....its smooth...it's heavenly
5
Their waffle and ice cream is really out of this world. Very nice flavor ice cream and their waffle is a must try and it tasted so good.
5
Today we visited Creamier @ Gillman baracks. What a great spot to relax.....staff was so friendly and attentive. Ice latte was excellent and very relaxing spot with nice music and cooling fan. Great for waffle and ice cream.
4
Cosy atmosphere at small store. Popped by a few times over CNY, but they were closed. Finally tried their earl grey lavender ice cream with waffles. Not too sweet. Heard they also their ice cream in tub for takeaway. Will definitely visit again
5
Whenever I crave for waffles, I always head to Creamier. I've had waffles at many restaurants and cafes but none are comparable to Creamier. The quality and taste of the waffles are always the same. They never disappoint!
5
Tried a double scoop($6.00) hazelnut milk chocolate (premium flavour +$1.00) and horlicks chocolate chip and it didn't disappoint. We walked about 15-20mins for this and it was absolutely worth it and worth a visit if you're at Toa Payoh. It has a smooth gelato like finish at a very affordable price. Thank you for melting away the troubles from another scorching day in sunny Singapore. √¢Àú
4
They have two branches, one in Alexander which was unfortunately closed when we visited hgh the grounds are lovely, and the branch in Toa Payoh which is much smaller and usually packed.The waffles are smaller than others, but delightfully crispy and tasty, with a nice crunch. Pair it with a couple of scoops of ice cream and you are in dessert heaven. We espeically like the earl grey, sea salt gula melaka and pistachio flavours.The waffles are mad to order, so it can take around 10-15 minutes for your order to reach the table, but it is worth waiting for. Service is friendly and you can always ask for a taste of the flavours they have
5
Visited their shop at Gillman Barracks and really love it there. Place was quite chill and relax, service was great too!..tried their seasonal chocolate with tempeh ice cream and also madagascar vanilla ice cream on top of their freshly baked waffle. The best part of this I think was the sauce they put around the plate that really brings out the taste. It was like caramel or maple sauce that really compliments the waffle and ice cream!..sure would come back again
5
I love the banana flavor. Its great! Its not super sweet as many places,. I love the banana flavor. Its great!
5
Amazing choice of ice creams available. Waffles are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Perfect combination with exotic ice cream flavours.
5
Best ice cream waffle i ever had. love their sea salt ice cream! the Q is always long but its a must try!
4
We had ice cream and coffee with amazing Flavors.
Staff is effective but not so friendly.
We ordered espresso tonic -curious about the name- but they hadn't it.
5
Crispy waffles made on the spot, topped with home made ice cream. Absolutely delicious, would satisfy any sweet tooth. But be prepared to wait for a seat since the waffles are not for takeaways.
5
Wonderful home made ice cream with real solid flavour. Yes, it's not cheap, but in this case I think you do get what you pay for. Beautiful waffles, too. My daughter accidentally dropped her ice cream once, and they gave her a new scoop free of charge. You don't get that every day. Weekends are busy, so you may have to take away or sit outside. There's limited seating available inside. First come first serve.We are regulars of this place, and will return over and over and over and over....
4
I stayed nearby. Visited this ice cream shop since it open and I also see the jump of the 1st day price to now. It consider a huge jump on the waffles place as It was in my cheapest and best waffles in Singapore once. That is in the past, when it get more popular, the price shoot up but still accept more crowd. Ice cream is good, full flavour for some. I personally quite like the ice cream here and once a while if it is not that crowded, I do sit down and enjoy the desserts. Waffles standard vary, someday I found it is really good, someday I will feel..what's wrong with it
5
Came here on a weekend evening with family. I've been visting Creamier regularly for the last 2 years - it's a nice, quiet, and beautifully decorated cafe with custom artwork by the owner. Their signature waffles and coffee must be tried. I decided to go for the waffles + ice cream combo. The dollop of ice cream was creamy as hell and naturally sweetened ( I tried the Madagascar Vanilla). Ask for the staff to give you a taste of their different flavours as they have a lot of variety. The magnum opus and standout dish for me will always be the waffles. I consider anyone who can make waffles remain crunchy yet soft, even when lukewarm, an artist. A must visit for anyone looking for an offbeat hangout joint in a quiet part of the city. PS- They have a new and larger outlet at the Gillman Barracks Art Gallery, do check that as well
5
One of the best hang out places around Toa Payoh for great desserts! A quaint little spot in between neighbourhood HDBs, you can get great tasting waffles, and superb ice-creams of various REAL flavours ~ absolutely delectable! And I absolutely adore the shop's decor and layout, small yet comfortable :
5
This was a delightful find. We headed to Masons for lunch and on a whim decided to skip dessert there and have coffee and ice cream at this informal joint instead. I LURVE earl grey tea and to have it mixed in so delicately with lavender was the highlight of that day. Aside: IMHO, the best lavender ice cream is at Tom's Palette. Yum. No pics unfortunately as I couldn't wait to tuck in. Have fun
2
Delicious ice cream with waffles.
Good looking latte art.
However the taste of coffee is bad. Quality of beans used spoiled the whole experience.
4
I like it! Located at Toa Payoh, it is a small and cozy cafe that serves yummy and crispy waffles. They also offer handcrafted ice-cream with quite unique flavors.
4
I love Creamier and have been a patron for awhile. Love the texture of the ice creams they have and waffles are amazing.Have to say this time's visit was a let down. The girl with green hair handling the cashier was extremely rude. Wanting to take an order quickly and move on to the next customer is not a crime. However the way she said it and when she repeated after me was as if I was stupid and I didn't know what I was ordering. Sorry if I would also like to check if we understood each other.
4
This place was on my list for awhile. Last week we went to some places nearly and decided to check it out. The Mango & Passion was very creamy. Aroma of both fruits was strong and taste excellent. The mocha one also taste very good and nice aroma. The sugar cone was crispy. Staffs was not really friendly neither attentive. Place decorates quite cute and quite small space. Avoid peak hours is best.
4
My friend and I were around nearby and we decided to give it a try as they have very good review.This place is very crowded regardless what time it is. We have to take the outdoor seats which is better than no seat. The waffle was very crispy and the they have unique ice cream flavours like earl grey lavender. We had bottles of fruit beer as there were promotion (3 for the price of 2) 2 bottles of beer cost $2
5
Was introduced to this place by a friend who lives in Toa Payoh. Fell in love 1st time i went & tasted their Earl grey lavender ice cream on top of 2 pieces of waffles. Simply yummy!The way they blend the earl grey & lavender ice cream makes it taste so perfect..can't find this taste any where else! Their secret recipe waffles (freshly baked,takes up to 15mins waiting time) goes very well with the ice cream. I am hooked to it!! Though i stay in the East,i don't mind travelling all the way to Toa Payoh to enjoy my favourite ice cream & waffles. They have many other ice cream flavours too and they allow you to sample the ice cream before you make your choice. The flip side of Creamier is,it's a little pricey ($8.80 for a single scoop ice cream & waffles), always too crowded, no seats and staff are not very friendly/nice
1
This place is supposedly popular for its Waffles and Ice Cream! But the shops are way too small, very few sitting area, crampy place, poor service! I have patronised 2 of their outlets and my experienced is still bad! Firstly, i went to their 1st outlet in Toa Payoh and it was packed and even the ordering area was soooo cramped up and u'll jus get so irritated when you are queuing and people keep knocking into you or you have to keep making way for patrons to cross etc not even hoping of getting a seat inside the cafe as I thought, maybe i can do a take away and try them out instead, but in e end, i gave up and left! The 2nd time I went and decided to give it another shot, this time round we had 4 adults and 2 kids! Oh boy ... we waited for quite a while and we managed to find 2 separate tables or should I say, we have to share tables with other patrons, and we were cramped at some corners and the 2 kids have to be eating their ice cream and waffles being squashed at a corner! How will one get to enjoy even if they sell the BEST Waffles in Singapore!! Just last Sun, I went to their outlet in Gilman Village and gosh ... this is such an inconvenient place and I would reckon that most patrons will probably have to get there by car or taxi but definitely not an accessible location. Can you imagine, they have less than 20 chairs in the entire cafe! There were 7 of us and we ordered Waffles and Ice creams and drinks and guess what, we were FORCED to gobble up our desserts and drinks as we felt very very stressful as there are many people standing around our table waiting for our seats!! How horrible is that! I would rather, they should just do take away instead and not even have all those few chairs n tables for their customers! What kind of service and cafe is this! My friends and I told ourself, we will boycott this place ever! Such bad experience! my 3rd encounter!!
5
This little cafe was amazingly crowded on weekend n was surprised on a Wednesday, it was crowded too..As it was my 1st time there, I don't know what to order n give thumbs up for service staff who let me try their popular ice cream n must say the recommendation was good. .The waffle portion was pretty generous n top with ice cream. . The taste is superb....Got to go again to try out favors..
5
In the heartland of tpy lives this amazing waffle place or should i say cafe! Took a bus down from tpy inter and reached within 8 mins! It isn't really spacious but def cozy/vintage! There's a 15 min waiting time for the waffles, but so worth the wait! Would def be back for more!
3
Personally, I find Creamier overrated despite several visits. It is always packed even in the late afternoon after lunch hours, the place is cramped and tiny, getting there is a hassle because it is such a walk from SPH and the MRT, the items there are not that cheap, and the waffles are nothing to shout about. You can find them at many other places. I do particularly enjoy some of the ice cream flavours such as Earl Grey Lavender and Thai Iced Tea though
5
Waffles is nice & crispy, ice cream wise have alot of variety. the only disadvantage is the shop is small & usually alot of crowd thus need to wait. This waffles is a small & cum with 2 but its nice.
5
Homemade premiere ice cream that is one of the best in town! Love their sea salt gula melaka flavour!
3
Small shop, not friendly staffs starring at us like you want to come in? He closed the door I guess to avoid the cool air slips. I mean, maybe they definitely don't have to worry about the sales and crowds anymore cos they are so famous and can't live without for many. The owner should really take note of this. Ice cream flavors are many and taste okay, ice team melt fast and it became watery waffle. Waffle texture is solid, syrup and around it goes very well with waffle. But the waffle are too starchy and I can taste the full egg in. Maybe this is their special recipe of the waffle or I might taste it wrongly. It is not as spongy inside or crunchy outside as I have tried. It's even not cool when so many people highly recommended it.
4
You have to try it to know why it's so popular and good. Waffles was fluffy and soft. All ice cream flavors are good so you'll have a hard time choosing. I suggest going either after lunch or before as it will be very packed during lunch time. A must go!
4
Good place to relax and enjoy ice cream with waffles, is just the under HDB but the service and quality of food five is like restaurant. They have daily special ice cream and must try the tah Tarik ice cream. Basic is $3.20 for single scoop and top up 90cents for premium . Their scope is big than other , so worth to pay . Noted that Monday are close
4
This small ice cream cafe serves a good selection of local and modern flavours, such as earl grey lavender, sea salt gula melaka etc.Their waffles are freshly made, and one of the best I've tasted here. Seating capacity is not plentiful here, but that doesn't quite deter people from queuing up for the ice cream and waffles.Worth the visit
5
Brought here by a friend who stays in Singapore and it is amazing. We could never find out about this place without someone navigating us through the many HDBs. You'll have to get down from the Bradell station on the red line and walk on from there. The ice-cream I had was creamy as the name suggests and waffles are crispy, way more crispy than other F&Bs who claims to be the waffles 'expert'.Hands down best so far, if you have a craving just head over there though it is hard to get a place as the outlet is rather small and doesn't seat a lot. Not a drawback as I feel the tiny yet cozy seating is rather complimenting its ice-cream in a way
5
There are some great flavours to try here. I like the Sea Salt Gula Melaka! Yummy!!The seating area is a bit small and cramped though. Suggest to buy and go unless you want to try the waffles which go well with the ice cream.Go in the afternoon if you want to skip the queues. After-dinner queues can be long!Not forgetting the great and friendly staff! Cheers!
4
We have tried many waffles from many different establishments over many years and by far, Creamier has the best waffles in Singapore and we always come back for more! The coffee and ice cream are not bad too, especially the Banana Chocolate Chip Crumble, Earl Grey Lavender and the Sea Salt Gula Melaka.Creamier is a short walk from Caldecott and Braddell stations and is relatively easy to find. It is always crowded during "dessert" times so it is best to go outside of those hours. The only gripe we have is that the seats are too small and uncomfortable and it can get difficult to maneuver your way between the cashier and your seat
4
When I need a waffle fix, the is the go to place. Their fluffy waffles are crispy on the outside and a great accompaniment to their selection of waffles. My favourite flavour is the thai milk tea. It's go good, easily one of the best waffle ice cream combo in Singapore.
5
The location of Creamier might be difficult to find but it is definitely worth the trip down. One of the best ice cream cafe shop in town.
5
Crowded cuz it's such a small place but worth the wait for a table so that you can order a plate of fresh made waffle (2 PCs) and a big scoop of ice cream! Else you can always opt for to-go. Reasonable priced too! <$10.
4
This place is always packed to the brim with customers but the waffle & ice cream combination is one of the best we've tasted. Waffle was crispy on the outside but light & fluffy on the inside. The ice cream, as the name of the caf√© suggests, is creamy and delicious. If you're looking for a place to chill out and have some yummy waffle & ice cream, this is not the place. Be prepared to eat and run or do a takeout. If you don't mind the heat, there are some public benches just outside the caf√© where you can sit and enjoy your ice cream! Sometimes, you can even get to enjoy the sight of parrots with colourful plumes flying about at the field outside the caf√©

After lunch at Toa Payoh, my colleague was raving about this ice cream store nearby. We promptly headed there after lunch. Its was after 2pm, and the store wasn‚Äôt so crowded with- Banana Chocolate Chip Crumbles: Creamy ripe bananas with home made cookie crumbles and premium coverture chocolate chips. I found the banana flavour unique and the crumbles and chocolate chip all came together well. Good! - Earl Grey Lavender: This creamy ice cream is infused with French Earl Grey tea with hints of lavender notes.Two scoops costs $5.60. I liked the mild falvour of the earl grey tea and the lavender pairing. Try it! Another flavour that I tasted was the Sea Salt Gula Melaka, which is also good. But I wanted something lighter in flavour and sweeter after my heavy lunch, so I opted for the earlier flavours. My friend highly recommended the waffles, which are made to order to go with the ice cream. Will be back here again for that with the ice cream. A pint of ice cream will cost $11.50 for a standard flavour and more if it‚Äôs a special flavour. Recommended
4
In the midst of busy Singapore, just near the center of the city, this ice cream shop is situated. It's quite small for dine in but people used to eat outside the shop, there are 2 park tables outside where you can have your waffle and ice cream. It has a little town ice cream shop feel because if mot situated in the crowded city
5
Brought here by a local, I was quite skeptikal in the beginning as the area itself looks just like a residence compound. But then I saw the huge line and cute shop, and when our turn was up I ordered the gula malacca ice cream and another flavour I dont remember. We actually went there for the waffles, as that's what they are famous for but undortunately they were sold our, and honestly it was pretty late when we went there. But the ice cream, Ah-mazing. A must try, the gula malakka flavour. Gonna go again this summer while in Singapore.
5
Creamier Ice Cream is a MUST try yet it takes an effort to get to the place if you live closer to the CBD. However, make it an adventure - get on the MRT and alight at Braddell station exit B and navigate towards Blk 128. IT IS WORTH IT - EVERY SINGLE CALORIE DIGESTED IS WORTH IT.I ordered a Sea Salt Gula Melaka on top of a double serve of crispy waffles placed on top of a delicate layer of chocolate maple syrup. To complement I ordered a most refreshing home made no sugar added Black Currant Ice Tea.I went there on an early Saturday afternoon; the place was jammed packed already but I was fortunate to find a chair next to the kitchen entry enabling me to observe the handicraft. Indeed, needless to say, although I have the capacity to enjoy a larger amount of ice cream - the one scoop of the Gula Melaka was sufficient - I will certainly make return visits to enjoy all the other flavours - PLUS I will bring a cooler bag - or two bags - to stock my freezer with many flavours of these most amazing delicious ice creams - BEST I EVER TASTED! The place itself got a great feel and ambiance to it - the music played was exquisite - I felt like being in any chick neighbourhoods of New York, London or, Barcelona - but not at an HDB estate - and the people running the place are wonderful.Thank you Creamier for an amazing Ice Cream Adventure away from the artificial ice creams of the CBD

After a heavy feast at Newton Circus Hawker Centre and whilst heading home, my friend was craving for ice cream so we decided to stop by braddell. Sadly though at 930pm, 30 mins till closing, they ran out of waffles.We tasted a few of their ice creams before deciding in earl grey lavender and banana nut milk. At $5.80 for 2 scoops, I felt it was reasonable. The scoops were big.The earl grey lavender was subtly sweet and when I closed my eyes, I imagined I was eating a cup of tea ice cream! It was superb and when I wanted to take home a pint of it, they were out of it. So I ended up taking home a pint of thai milk tea, which is also delicious!The banana nut milk had real banana fruit and nuts in there. It was nice to bite into abit of fruit and nut, whilst savouring the milky and creamy ice cream.You can help yourself to iced water. The shop itself is always crowded, as there is a neighbourhood playground right in front of the shop. You can always get your ice cream in a cup or cone, and sit on the park benches out side.I will definitely be back to try their waffles at some point, but for now.. I will make my own waffles at home and enjoy it with my pint of thai milk tea ice cream :
2
I visited the place a few months later, after hearing that there was Rum n' Raisin flavoured ice cream here. The place was packed to the door as usual, so I went in with the sole intention of doing a take-away of the ice-cream.So it turns out the Rum n' Raisin was a premium flavour, so that was a 90cents top-up on top of the base cost of the scoop of ice-cream ($3.30).The ice cream was not that sweet, which is a good thing, but the taste of rum was weak, almost like there were only "trace" amounts of rum inside (if there was any inside at all!).It was a very dissatisfying experience with their Rum n' Raisin flavour. There really should be some regulation on a minimum % of rum content inside all Rum n' Raisin flavours before ice cream parlours can pass it off as "Rum n' Raisin"
5
Awesome place for ice cream my mum and husband are big fans of ice cream and we searched for the best ice cream place in Singapore and we found Creamier, we took a cab and went to the place only to find out some local grocerie stores and HDB's and thought we ended up at the wrong place but when we enquired ther for Creamier we found the place a small outlet which was croweded with people :o surprised we went in luckily found a place to sit and ordered yummy ice cream with waffle was tasty hot cold yumm !!My mom and husband loved the ice cream and they wanted to come back again soonGood job guys who started the place
5
Is on weekday 1 pm ,place already fully seat till playgrd . The price of ice cream in HDB area not cheap!Sea salt gula Melaka with Thai milk tea the best mix two scope.

We had pistachio, strawberry, mango passion fruit ice cream, all of them are great treats. especially the roasted pistachio, it's the must try!

I love ice cream and waffle. And when I saw someone posted a picture of Cremier‚Äôs Thai Milk Tea ice cream, I was determined to visit this place when I was in SG recently.Took the MRT to Braddell station, took exit A and it was about a 10 minutes walk.The shop itself was not big, it was already packed when we reached there about 12 something. My sis ordered a single scoop Sea Salt Gula Melaka, and the waffle with single scoop of Thai Milk Tea. Our friend had a double scoop of Banana Chocolate Chip Crumbles, and Horlicks Choc Chip.Let me start with the texture of the ice cream. It was very smooth and creamy, and it does not melt fast. The waffle was very good too, crispy on the outside, while soft and fluffy on the inside. It is served with maple syrup and a dust of icing sugar. For taste wise, the Sea Salt Gula Melaka was very nice, sweet Gula Melaka with a hint of saltiness from the Sea Salt. I think this is their take on salted caramel, which most ice cream parlours would have. A nice twist indeed : ) For the Thai Milk Tea, imagine licking silky milk tea, instead of drinking it. It has a balanced aroma between the tea and milk flavour. We steal a few spoon of the Banana Chocolate Chip Crumbles and Horlicks Choc Chip from our friend. We can taste the distinct banana flavour in the Banana Chocolate Chip Crumbles. I think fresh bananas were used, instead of banana essence. While the Horlicks Choc Chip exudes strong aroma of Horlicks, reminded us of the Horlicks drink that we used to drink when we were kids. The chocolate chip in it was rather subtle, complimenting the Horlicks, rather than overpowering it.The ice cream was so good, that we decided to order cones for our walk back to the MRT station. Had the Earl Grey Lavender, which also turned out to be very good. The earl grey and lavender complimented each other very well. I don‚Äôt often get lavender flavoured ice cream outside of Japan, so this was a good find for me.Price wise, it think it is very reasonable. A single scoop goes for SGD 3, while double scoop is SGD5. You‚Äôll have to add SGD0.80 for premium flavours, this will be marked with a star. By default, the waffle comes with single scoop of ice cream, at SGD8.50, additional scoop of ice cream will be SGD2.50. They even have 1 pint and 1 litre sizes

I think it's a brilliant idea to open this stall at a mature estate! It brings families, friends together; it adds vibrance to this town. The queue is an indication of how popular it is and also affordable it can be.My wife and I has to queue but in no time, we got our double scoop- ice Thai tea and earl grey lavender flavors in a cup! The former is not too sweet and one can taste the sweetness of the lavender! Do expect to have no seats available on weekend afternoon that's when we were there...and I heard ppl coming from outside of toa payoh to have ice cream there.
5
3 of us arrived at about 645pm. Place was already crowded. We ordered (no table available yet). The staff asked us for the 3 flavors of ice cream we wanted (naively, I thought that meant my waffles come with 3 scoops of ice cream!). Little did we know that the waffles only comes with one scoop! And the other scoops are charged separately (she didn't even inform us, she just charged it into the bill). Honestly, I only blamed my own greed, thinking that the waffles comes with 3 scoops! Otherwise, I think 2 scoops of ice cream with the waffles would have been just nice! Didn't mind the extra charges for the extra scoops but I think it's misleading - her not telling us and two, the menu does not tell you that either!! Nevertheless, it's great ice cream and waffles! By 730pm, there's a long queue outside.. And this was a weekday evening!!! Very limited seating. Let's hope they expand soon!! Will definitely come back.
5
The Waffles are crunchy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Topped off with ice cream that is home-made, one only can desire to come back for more! We tried the Gula Melaka ice cream and it was L O V E L Y! They serve great coffee to bring you back to reality. Crowds are expected daily, so bring a whole lot of patience with you when you visit

Ordered a waffle with a scoop of mochacinno ice-cream, it was very pretty decent with strong hints of coffee in the ice cream.Also ordered a Long Black, but not sure why it took 20 minutes to arrive despite being off-peak weekday hours when I was there.The Long Black came with a reddish-brown tinge. It was sour to the taste - very sour. I did not like it at all. When I asked for sugar, the staff directed me to a small pot of sugar beside the counter, with a spoon in it. Not cool - for the price I paid ($4+? $4.20? can't remember), I was expecting either a sugar satchet to come with the cup, or a pot of sugar at each table. Not for a shared pot in the whole establishment for which I must walk up with my cup of coffee to the cashier's to access to the sugar.The waffle was the only-saving grace (I do understand it is famous for its waffles). But stay away from the coffee.Seating is also very limited so do go there only during off-peak hours
5
Creamier used to be a small and cozy cafe located in a suburb. But as word got out, Creamier, still puny, but no longer cozy. When you head down in the evening till closing, do not be turn off by the long queue that extended out from the shop. Get closer and the strong aroma of waffles is sure to get you intoxicated. During peak hours, the freshly baked waffles requires about 20-30min of waiting time. Meanwhile, wait for your seat and enjoy a cup of coffee or tea. Wide selection of ice-cream from the traditional ones like Vanilla to exotic ones like Thai Milk Tea. My all time favorite is the Sea salt ice-cream, a heavenly creation. Each waffles comes with 2 scoops of ice-cream. Worth to try the rootbeer float too as you get to savour a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You know that the vanilla ice-cream is richly flavoured when you get to see spots of vanilla.No reservation is allowed. Due to the highly limited seating capacity, you see customers seating at the playground too. Walking distance from Braddell and Caldecott MRT station

I watched a video somewhere about their shop and wanted to stop by. Had to take a cab ride there from our hotel, but it was worth it. It's located in a neighborhood area and took us 15 minutes to get there. I ordered a scoop of the Summer Strawberries and a scoop of Banana Chocolate Chip on top of waffles (of course) as well as an Iced Mocha. Forgot what my boyfriend ordered but it was delicious too. Noticed they served tea and beer, too but didn't try it.Neat little experience and my mission was to check it out. It's a local spot and probably wouldn't get tourists on a regular day, so if you go make sure you blend in. Unfortunately for us, we had about 4 shopping bags from shopping on Orchid Road.
5
3 times. That's how many times we tried to get our Sunday family outing timing right to come to creamier. All 3 times we were too early and couldn't wait for them to open at noon. So today wa the day. A well-planned brunch at the nearby 2-storey food centre (this is another story) with great porridge, tasty chicken rice, delish prawn noodle soup, and flavorful teochew hand-made BBQ pork buns- led us to waiting patiently outside creamier at 11.50am. 12pm came and we were the first at the counter, the kids sampling to decide what they wanted all 6 scoops of ice cream were to be. At 12.02pm (I'm serious), before they decided on the flavours, the queue had swelled to the entrance. When we sat down to wait for the waffles, the cafe was full... OMG, they had fans! And rightly so. The waffles were deliciously crispy outside, with enough fluffy inside. The ice cream was nice, full and creamy... And the affogato I had was delicious vanilla with fantastic coffee, one worthy of fans in itself.Service was warm and friendly, as much as I thought they could be dealing with a crowd like that, and everyone looked like they were enjoying the rush of the crowd. A must-try in the middle of the heartlands. A real gem of a find
