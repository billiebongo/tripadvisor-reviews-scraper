First visit to Roma's Deli for 2018 recently. The menu hasn't changed and it's still possible to get a soup and a pasta dish for around $10. Friendly service and decent quality food for the price.

I loved the food here. There are decent options to choose from and the food is appropriately price. The taste is just yumm

Came back here last week for another tasty vegetarian pasta meal. Really good value at less than $10 for a soup and a pasta. I suspect this will become a regular place for me.

Came here today for lunch and opted for one of the lunch sets for less than $10. This consisted of a broccoli soup and a pasta. Both were really quite decent. Excellent value for money and efficient service.

A small and cosy vegetarian restaurant in Singapore city centre (Shaw Towers along Beach Road). Western vegetarian cuisine with good range of baked specialties, sandwiches, soups and salads. Friendly owner and good service. One of my family's favourite vegetarian dining place in Singapore.

This is the only vegetarian non-Indian place at my office tower but has great taste. The rice opions, pasta everything is quite good and big in portions. Enjoyed the baked curry potato rice.

I liked the fact that it was a pure vegetarian restaurant. They served a good combo of soup, pasta and a drink for $ 11. Not cheap, but decent food for a decent price.

The vegetarian food at this little cafe in Shaw Tower isn't particularly remarkable, but it's hard to beat the value for money. I paid less than $10 for a decent mushroom soup and some baked pasta. No line or delays either. My 2nd visit and I'm sure I'll be back for more

We came on a casual dinner, ambiance is nice. Enough space for family and friends, gets cramped thou at peak hours. Self order and pay first at cashier. Menu is quite limited.We tried the chicken satay spegetti which was very good, had good flavour. The samabal prawn spegetti was not very good. Tasted abit sour and flavour was abit off. The cheese herbs break was very good. Then again needed more flavour in the herb. Costed us $20 for 2 spegetti ala carte and cheese herb bread
