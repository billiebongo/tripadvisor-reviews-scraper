We had a really great Indian meal here.
Very tasty and authentic.
Sat outside which was nice - inside did not seem quite so pleasant.

A very nice place with good food and unique flavors! It slightly expensive but reasonable compared to nearby Indian Restaurants. Amazing naan :)

Very average. Once the guy got you off the street to inside the service dropped. The Indian family next to us got better service. Was not impressed. Food was average compared to other places.

Indian house offers a variety of Indian dishes. I tried chicken and Veg Briyani. It was very awesome.

Been going to this place for years. Never disappointed. Not the cheapest around but considering the fact that I keep going back..... they even accommodate us by making green chilli pakora (it's not on the menu), and it was super nice. Don't be afraid to ask for spicy... the heat level is right up there for spice lovers, but if u don't request u still get a decent meal. (I'm Chilli nuts by the way). Service is great and ambience.... it's along the river, what more can u ask for

Boat Quay is always a good spot to dine al fresco in Singapore as long as the rain stays away - though most of the restaurants have gazebo shelters in case of a sudden deluge. I wandered down the bustling quayside and, needing a vindaloo, decided to try Indian House with no prior research or recommendation. There was an available table next to a row of 8 partying Indian guys in high spirits - always a good sign, though they seemed to be drinking only soda water. It is always difficult dining solo in an Indian restaurant as usually one dish is more than enough food so unless you don't mind being lumbered with a take away or can order a Thali, you are not going to get much variety. I decided to stick with a vindaloo and promptly ordered the lamb version described as a spicy treat of lamb and potatoes. Potatoes? An authentic vindaloo should not have potatoes since the name vindaloo derives from the Portuguese term "vin d'alho," or garlic wine (roughly pronounced "veen dalyoo"). Since the Indian word for potatoes is aloo, there is a common misconception that vindaloo should contain potatoes. After ordering the vindaloo sans potatoes accompanied by garlic nan (yes it should be rice) and a pint-sized can of Kingfisher, I sat back to enjoy the fresh breeze blowing from the creek or rather the overhead fans.A basket of flaky poppadums soon arrived accompanied by rather watery green mint sauce and sweet mango chutney. The vindaloo arrived within about 5 minutes and was well balanced, wholesome and deliciously spicy with (mostly) tender succulent lamb. This would be a big hit in any UK restaurant. A sound of a rolling empty carton distracted me to notice a bottle of Glenfiddich under the adjacent table, No wonder! Nevertheless, my dining companions also agreed that the food was excellent and after confirming that I supported Manchester United, proceeded to enquire how easy it was emigrate to England. I would definitely recommend Indian House though admittedly only based on one dish. Service was quick and friendly, ambience was great with the al fresco setting on the quayside, and the food was excellent and well flavoured though not quite authentic

I ate here with a group of international visitors from France, Germany and Australia. The Staff were excellent as was the food. I had recently eaten just down boat quay a little and the experiences were very different. I had written off boat quay but I must say that India House was terrific. Walking boat key you are constantly hassled by people wanting you to eat in their shop..... Walk past and find India House it is worth it. The staff were incredibly good. The food prices were OK (on the high side for Singapore but with the view and experience I think worth it). The food was excellent..

My fiancÃ© and I were looking for a restaurant around 10PM. At this hour, the restaurants in Boat Quay are not really animated but Indian House was still welcoming customers. As Indian food lovers, we recommend this restaurant. We ordered the chicken korma and chicken Madras. Both were very delicious but I would not recommend the chicken Madras for people that are not used to eat very spicy. A little bit pricy but it worth it

We stayed in Singapore for a week. We had Dinner at the Indian House once. They are lucky to be located at the wunderful river. Otherwise they would be ignored. The food is not bad but also not more than average. We had both chicken which was ok. The rice was boring, the Naan Bread was not fresh

Part of the famous Boat Quay location. This is yet another nice place for dinner. Wonderful view of the river and city skyline.

Good curry, polite staff, they understand Gluten Free options.
The view right on the Singapore river was excellent. Would defiantly go back.

Walking up Boat Quay there is the usual harassment of restauranturs trying to guide you into their restaurants. This is no exception! Seated outdoors the table had great views of the river. There were fans above to offer some respite from the heat. Ordered a selection of dishes which we shared. Excellent food and good service. Waiter gave us a card for 20% discount should we decide to return. Good friendly service with tasty food and fantastic views.

I have been here quite a number of times now..its got really nice north indian food. good place to just go and grab set lunch menu, or order your own..nothing fancy though..can sit outside next to the river and enjoy cool breeze on a good day..the food just works...very good service..nice staff...also did a small team lunch and it worked out pretty well...definitely recommend if you just want to have good food .

Despite its location on the boat quai, which is pretty much reserved for tourists only, the food is convincingly good. I had the samosas and a chicken tikka masala and both reminded me of my trips to India.The outdoor terasse is nice and staff is friendly.Like every restaurant in that area, prices are a little high though

These guys have not scored highly for service but we found it friendly and efficient. Food takes a while to arrive and then boom in our case mains turned up a couple of minutes after entree so we had to send it back. And while we waited for 1st course the free papadums kept us going. TIP After choosing your restaurant on Boat Quay I recommend you ask for the price for your drinks before sitting down. You need to be offered "happy hour" price, not 28 or 30 dollars for a jug of Tiger!!! We paid 28 yesterday 18.90 here today.

This is at Boat Quay, so expect the prices to be 20% more than normal because of the location and water. That being said, I received nice service (albeit lunchtime on a Sunday) and enjoyed some great naan bread and lamb curry. Also had some palak paneer that was good. A pretty good view sitting on the water looking at Singapore across the Quay

I had just arrived in Singapore and fancied a curry. I wandered down to the Boat Quay which wasn't so far from my hotel and I just picked on the Indian House as it seemed to be quite popular. And it had nice views over the river.With a Kingfisher beer quickly I ordered I glanced through the menu and I decided to go for the standard choice I usually make when visiting an Indian restaurant on my trips in the UK. That is papadams with assorted pickles, onion bhajis followed by chicken vindaloo with pilau rice. The food came quite quickly and was obviously a local version of what I have come to expect in the UK. I missed some decent lime pickle to accompany the papadams and the onion bhajis were uniformly prepared from slices of onions which seemed to have been deep fried in the chickpea batter. They were so uniformly shaped that I couldn't help wondering if they hadn't come out of the deep freezer. As I was halfway through my bhajis my main course arrived. Now that really irritates me. I had it sent back so that I could finish one thing before the next arrived. Perhaps this is local culture but I didn't appreciate having my food all piled up in front of me. Anyway the vindaloo was OK - plenty of white chicken in a reddish sauce with potatoes. Hot & spicy? No, not really. I skipped a dessert, had a second beer and then headed back to my hotel to escape the Singaporean heat and get a decent nights sleep

Went here alone and had a vegetarian dish which was very good. Prices are average for this part of Singapore, and also you pay for the view over the Singapore river I guess. The Naan bread could have been bigger, but in general, the food was very tasty. Really need to improve on the service tough.

we stopped here on a walk around the quay and this was fine. however the guy seem to want to get his money as soon as we ordered. never mind he had to wait until we had finished. The view over the key was why we stopped and the drinks were refreshing. so that's it
