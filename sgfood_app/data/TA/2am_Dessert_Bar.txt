Cute and tucked away in a corner of Holland Village. Nice place to grab dessert. Different options for different people's taste. I am giving 4/5 as I think this place is a bit overpriced for what they offer (in terms of food and service).
4
Excellent atmosphere, incredible food and really good service. They accommodated us even though we were walk ins and we thoroughly enjoyed the food. Biggest issue was choosing what to have. Amazing sounding menu and I will definitely go back.

Enjoyed visiting 2am dessert bar with my family to celebrate my daughter’s birthday. I have heard a lot of positive reviews from my friends and I am glad to say that we were not disappointed. Nice ambiance, unique dessert creations and great service made our special day very special.

My family and I went to 2am Dessert Bar a few days back and were so disappointed. After reading so much about this place and seeing it on NatGeo Channel we were really looking forward to our visit. It was not the easiest place to find and from the outside one could not tell if it was actually open. The inside of the restaurant lacked ambience - it was dark and soulless and fairly empty. One of my biggest hates was also a black bathroom. They automatically look dirty and feel uncomfortable especially as it is also a unisex bathroom. Not all the menu items were available as they were in the process of changing dishes. It would have been nice to be informed of this on the website. Desserts were decent - nothing wowed us and the plating of two of the desserts made it look like half the dessert was missing. I get the need to be ‘frou frou’ with plating but not at the expense of feeling short changed (green pistachio/coconut dessert). I appreciate that a lot of work goes into some of these desserts but it felt overpriced and definitely overhyped. I would say it’s a place to take your first date to impress him/her but not for a serious dessert kick that leaves you wishing to make the trip back again and again.

Absolutely by far the best desserts I have ever had the pleasure of devouring. If you have the time, I recommend a degustation menu and I do recommend pairing as it was so complimentary to the selection. Make your way to Holland Village and treat your tastebuds!

Chef Janice Wong's dessert bar is redefines your idea of desserts and introduces to a whole new world of those. If you always compared desserts with sweets or ice-creams like most of us in India do; be ready to for that notion to be turned upside down. The exquisite menu combined with the warm & chirpy team will surely win your heart over.I officially had the most expensive desserts ever - with their 5 course specialty. And it was totally worth it
4
Is quite expensive, but the desserts are well worth it, contemporary, unusual, well presented and very yummy. However not just the desserts are worth trying the whole menu is good, including the beverages, the toffee popcorn tea was delicious. Worth a visit and easy to get to my MRT

~totally unassuming side entrance welcoming you up, prolly intended for darkness!~my family ordered a dish each which we shared but there really wasn't much of anything to share...Beef Bombs were absolutely salty!BBQ Tacos were okbut we didn't come here to eat savories so on to dessertShades of Green omg the seriously small cluster of not enough to go around once was sadly left lackingHoney Cake tasted perfectly YUMzCacao Forest with it's cotton candy canopy melted away when the cacao liqueur is poured over it the theatrics was impressive Chocolate Tart the opposing tastes did balance quite wellbottomline, a great romantic atmosphere for couples and desserts are definitely designed for ladies ... unfortunately I'd not bring family because even at a ratio of 1:1 dessert is kinda built for half
5
After seeing Janice Wong on Masterchef in Australia we decided to try out her restaurant. We decided to eat dinner there too. The savoury menu is really just snacks so I would have dinner somewhere else next time. But the desserts were yum! The Cassis Plum was tart, fruity and refreshing all at the same time. My partner's chocolate tart was delicious, I just wish there was more so I could steal more from him
3
Desserts were tantalising on the tastebuds but over-priced. There was also a minimum cover charge of $15 per head. We tried the Chocolate H2O, Cassis Plum and Portobello Fries. The bar was tucked away on the 2nd storey and we had to walk past the alfreso dining area of another establishment and walk up a flight of stairs at the back to reach the bar. Not such a nice experience as the open area was filled with smokers. Overall, I wouldn't say it's a place that I would return to even though the desserts were nice
2
We wanted to go there because of the raving review through word of mouth. Sadly, the desserts were sad and lacked passion. Other than the fact that it opens late- it's nothing but a quiet, mysterious nook that doesn't have the content for its cover.
5
2 am dessert bar is hard to locate, as it is hiding next to bar with a small door going to the 2nd floor. The desserts was great, there is something new with the dessert. Something with a twists!
2
We found this place such a expensive for average dessert and drinks. Selling beer at $18, wow. I don't mind to pay more if it's star hotel's bar. Sorbet was ok, presentation of the dishes was sub-standard and not appropriate for sorbet. Sorbet was melting down out of the plate.Totally disappointed with dessert and price
3
To be fair, the desserts are not bad and well presented. But even so, they do not justify the kind of prices they charge. I do not feel that the desserts while good are value for money, sorry. Not quite sure I will return or recommend unless there is discount
4
I ordered Purple chestnut lava cake. It looked not too attractive for me but after I had it,it was interesting dessert. It had many texture in one dish, soft, crispy, a bit creamy, a bit chewy and crunchy. Another thing I liked in this dessert is Lavender ice cream, it had a very nice fragrance and good taste.I know this shop from Master chef Australia, Adam Liaw, he visited this shop when he was in Singapore
4
We went to 2am after lunch hoping for a yummy dessert on a lovely Sunday afternoon. The place is hidden in a corner in Holland Village. Not that easy to find. With the hype and awesome reviews I've heard about, it was a let down when we entered the place. It is a modern setting and some interesting colours. But, it seemed quite badly maintained - a little dirty. The air con wasn't great either, especially on a sunny afternoon you walk around hunting for the place and climb up the stairs to a rather stuffy room. It is much smaller than I had imagined given the "wow" reviews. Anyway, we were there for the dessert, so we dived into the menu and are told that few items were not available. So we settle for whats there of course. The Hanasakura was really nice. Desserts are surely beautiful. The taste MAY not match the looks that much. I expected more than what I paid for
2
We went to 2am a few weeks ago. We had heard great things about 2am, and Janice Wong, so we were looking forward to it. It's well known that 2am is a bit of a hidden gem(?), so we had read enough about how to find it.We were greeted warmly by the staff, and promptly seated. For a pricey venue, the place felt a little, well, dirty. It didn't look to have been dusted or given a good bit of effort in a while. This place was fully booked, and we saw people actually turned away! The real disappointment came when the menus were given to us, and we were given a lengthy list of what wasn't available for the night, which were most of the "showpiece" desserts or items with a bit of theatrical excitement that we had heard about and looked forward to trying.We compromised, and ended up with desserts that we weren't necessarily thrilled about. One was served on a dish that had was either so hot from being washed, or the sorbet/ice cream wasn't cold enough, as by the time it arrived at the table, it was mostly liquid. 2am seems to be a consequence of either being neglected by its celebrity chef owner, or has already peaked and is on the downhill. Either way, we expected a lot more for what we paid, and compared to other dessert bar concept places we've been to (such as Om Nom in Melbourne) 2am is not meeting the standard
3
Went there 1 year ago. The decor is modern and nice. The presentations of the dessert is what I believe people would refer to as instagram-worthy. Everything looks great, but the taste is a bit flat. Wished there were more layers in the flavors. It's like you're expecting an explosion in your mouth and be like !!!!!!!!!! but instead you're greeted by -----------...Expected more, especially since they are charging so much for a dessert
3
I visited this dessert bar earlier today with my friends, the place was not so easy to find actually. The taste was quite good, i like the hanasakura, it is the red one in the photo. The other dessert i ordered was cassis plum, it was very sour. The price for both dessert was 24 SGD each, i think its a bit too expensive for 1 plate of small cake.
4
I had tried Janice Wong's Hong Kong restaurant and wasn't impressed. My friend said this one in Singapore is really famous. So the 6 of us decided to give it a try. There was a minimum charge of S$15 per person. I had the Hanasakura (which is an elegant variation of strawberry mousse cake) and it was divine. A friend got something (forgot the name) which looked awful like a plate of poop but it tasted so good I wanted seconds. It was made with peanut butter and chocolate. It was Saturday and the dessert bar looked like the "it" place for the young and hip. I don't blame the wait staff for wanting to guests to leave as soon as they finish. But... I got asked 3 times if they could remove my plate BEFORE I finished. I just put my fork down to drink water! And my friend still 4 churros to go! When we asked for water refill, the waiter would fill 1 glass and scurry away. Come on, there were 6 of us. This happened several times.Out of the 6 desserts we ordered amongst us, only 1 was a "never repeat". So we agreed the food was generally good. However, would management please improve service to match your price tag
2
Arrived here at 12am, yes very late but given the name I expected it to be still open. Sadly not, no food available. Had a luke warm beer and left.
4
Nice place to visit, desserts are various and delicious. Staffs are friendly but the price is quiet high
4
We traveled across town to sample Janice Wong's desserts only to be told that they were only accepting card payments that night as their machine was down. Undeterred, we returned the following afternoon to feast on her edible art degustation. Just like her store at the National Museum, this is a must-do for any foodie with a sweet tooth traveling Singapore
5
After heading to dinner at Marina Bay, some of the dessert options weren't calling out to us. By now it was 11 o'clock, and we searched for something open. We found this place on Tripadvisor and decided to give it a go. Thank goodness! This bar truly is a hidden gem. We didn't really know what to expect, but staff were amazingly friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered 4 desserts and all were just as incredible as the last. Mixologists were also there to suggest house cocktails which compliment your sweets. If you are heading to Singapore, this really is a must.
4
We saw this Dessert Bar on Destination Flavours Singapore and put it on our to do list. We visited this Dessert Bar twice. For those that are reading this it is CLOSED on Mondays. Our second visit was more successful and didn't disappoint. Tucked away in the back of Holland Village you could easily miss it if you don't look up to see the signage on their 1st floor window. It could do with some work on the building cause it's a bit off putting on entry. But desserts and service were fantastic. They even changed the construction of a dessert to cater for my friend who is a celiac.
3
2 AM Dessert Bar Over glorified dessert bar, that's my opinion. I always wanted to visit this place but sadly it didn't fulfill my sweet tooth. What we ordered I wasn't impressed with the taste since I expected it to be an explosion of different flavors that blended well with one another. I think I had too high hopes which did not render well. If you like fancy desserts with a more expensive cost, then yes, this is a place for you. The deserts Presentation are truly work of art. However, I was not impressed with the taste. The ambiance is super chill and swish, more like an luxurious bar. The location was a little bit hard to find. I would hurry back
2
Came here on the recommendation of some local friends and thought we found a gem as it was pretty busy even at 11pm on a weeknight. Service was fine and accommodating, and desserts look inspiring but didn't do great on the taste test. We had churros which could have been fried more than 3 hours ago as it was limp and stale. Minor point to note, what is served is actually spanish porras with cinnamon sugar, not exactly churros. Also tried the casis plum recommended by the staff and found the taste too tart for liking. Overall Fine if you're out of options at 2am as name of place suggests, but hope I will fine more interesting places during my 2 week stay in beautiful Singapore
5
First time I was here was more than 5 years ago, since then the lie-in couches in plush white leather have been replaced by functional booths, the place is a bit less dreamy and a bit more functional now, but the desserts are still to a high standard and this place remains an island of civilization in midst of the beer-fueled rough-charm chaos of touristy holland village... probably it is nostalgia but I would still recommend this place for a late night date!

Founded by award-winning, Singaporean celebrity pastry chef Janice Wong in September 2007, the 2am Dessert Bar is a modern, contemporary space, a fine dining dessert restaurant that pushes the culinary boundaries between sweet and savory with carefully researched, progressive dishes. Named for their daily closing time, each visit to the 2am Dessert Bar is a gastronomic experience, where each dish is a work of art in terms of taste, sight, smell, and colour, engaging all the senses. All this painstaking effort however, comes at a price, be prepared to splurge at 2am Dessert Bar.Ambience at 2am Dessert Bar is modern contemporary, much like the dishes. There is an elegant refinement in the spotlit place, contrasts of light and shadows play across the sleek high stone tables and artistic booth tables. Decorative lamps hang from varying heights, while a long bar counter draws the eye. Comfortable, welcoming, and relaxing, well suited to the long, lingering meals you'll have here.Service at 2am Dessert Bar is akin to most other fine dining establishments. Staff are courteous, polite, efficient, and professional. Guests are quickly greeted and seated upon entering, and bid farewell upon leaving. Staff are friendly and offer attentive service, they display good product knowledge on the menu, able to offer recommendations. They also introduce each dish when it's served, and share how best to consume it. I note they're quick to clear away empty / dirty tables when guests leave. Great.Food at 2am Dessert Bar is focused on modern contemporary desserts, with a small savoury snack menu. Each dish is beautifully plated and presented, looking like a work of art. Each bite challenges the mind, complex and varied ingredients combined in intricate ways to create playful highlights of flavour, yet each dessert isn't too heavy. Part of the experience is to see how each component tastes against each other. Portions are large, designed for communal dining and sharing. Prices are naturally expensive, budget about SGD $50 per person for about 2 desserts here

Janice Wong brings Forth Amazing Desserts, woven around Themes ... more like a Sweet Delectable but Edible Art pieces ~ With every course of desserts , the waiters would narrate the complex method used in weaving up this dessert and how to savour them . That really sounded Interesting.On our visit to Holland Village 2am Dessert Bar , we were told they were in the process of renovating and reintroducing new dishes to the menu We ordered a 3 course dessert... presentation style was beyond our imagination ! Pictures would Do justice better. Please DO Visit once to experience this Imaginative Exemplary Magical Dessert Bar.Hats Off : Janice Wong 
5
2am dessert bar is a must visit in Singapore for those dessert lover, like me! Appreciate on their presentation of dessert, of course the taste are great. Just love it.
2
Sorry, can't appreciate your dessert. The dessert is overpriced and over-rated. But it is very creative and innovation. Plum dessert is just too sour.
5
2am Dessert Bar is a must visit in Singapore, not only for dessert fans. The pairings of wine and dessert is great & Janice Wong's dessert creations are inspiring. Must visit!
5
We came here after seeing Janice Wong's Cassis Plum dessert on Masterchef Australia and we were not disappointed. Service and atmosphere were pleasant but nothing special; the desserts are the star here.
1
Was constantly reminded of the 15 charge per pax. Deserts look great, but honestly tasted normal only. Not worth the price at all. Presentation was nice though kudos for that. Overall not a good experience.
1
I thought 2am Dessert Bar would be the perfect place to call the night off with friends: nice place, nice desserts, nice waiters. Results: NOT AT ALL. No change in the menu for the past 7 months – I got the same menu than 7 months ago. Great proof of creativity and seasonal freshness.Other than that, it seems that the waiters just landed from the Moon. More than thirty minutes to get our drinks, obviously one by one – as if the waiters had only one hand.The service was appalling, the slowest service ever. The churros arrived basically 1 HOUR after ordering! It is only fried batter!!!!!! I guess they must have ground the wheat in the meantime. Way over-priced for the offered service. It is like paying for a nice bottle of wine and get it served in a dirty plastic cup

After having been blown away by the desserts created on Australia's Master Chef- we spent a few hours looking for the Bar- not easy to find- on a Saturday afternoon.The amotsphere of the place is cold and univiting. The menu is confusing- why would you offer savory stuff when you are a dessert bar? we had some and it was expensive rubbish...To the dessert: presentation poor- Masterchef contestants can teach Janice a thing or two: white cheese cake on a white plate with a drizzle of sauce . Uninspiring creation. Taste average.Chocolate tarte was lovely - ice cream very nice - a very tasty dish - but not worth a detour.The one highlght was the Churros - could have stayed all afternoon eating those away. Overall a let down of note. We stick to watching her on Masterchef
5
We went as a group of 5 (all ages from 22 up to 76) and had a great time. We'd originally made a booking, but had to change that to another day, which was no problem. We all ordered different desserts and then let everyone taste a little bit of ours, that way we got to try a mix of what was on the menu. We we're all very pleased with our choices and they were all delicious. We were so glad we went
1
I spend much of my life and income on fine dining. I was expecting more from this place. It is not easy to find, the staff were condescending because I arrived with son (aged 10) and they did not want to accommodate children- in a dessert restaurant! Regardless, with service and tax effectively it was $20 for a mere mouthful of dessert, the cassis plum that is so heavily promoted was only slightly larger than a golf ball. A not very memorable golf ball at that. I like pretty food and I am well prepared to pay for it, but I also expect a reasonable portion size. Their staff also need more training when dealing with guests
4
Finally visited it tonight and tried the famous Cassis Plum which featured on the Masterchef pressure test. The plum was sour and had an interesting matt texture but it was balanced by the sweet cream inside. The other elements (rice crisps and jelly) were quite sparse so didn't really add dimension to the dessert. If you like to tease your palette, it's worth trying. But at $24, I rather buy a big tub of Alfero gelato :
3
Great desserts and ambience. The dessert chefs are definitely professional, the service staff a let down that affected the overall experience here. Pricing are high, so expect to pay. MUST try the H2O, its simply great combination.
5
Add this to your must do list in Singapore! It is a unique experience for the more adventurous foodie. Food meets art.
5
So I don't have a sweet tooth but a mouth. Having heard loads about Janice Wong we made it a point to visit 2 am. I particularly wanted to try the cassis plum and was not disappointed. To die for! The attendant also took the time to explain the intricacies of dessert chemistry which was most fascinating. With the group we tried out nearly the entire menu and definitely mark this a must visit. Nothing close to this in india
2
Missus booked a place to go for desserts with parents. It's convenient location, ambiance and food was good, however since we entered staff reminded us at least 5 times that it's $15per person(not to forget, were told on phone when reserving the table). Service was TERRIBLE. Once the desert was served, had to ask multiple times for cutlery (and of course reminded again for $15pp). Do realise that they are running a business. However it's all about the experience, and I felt that they are in only there to grab bucks from my wallet and kick us out. Would have been better if they took cover charge at the entrance.Missus demons I'm being harsh, apologies if it's tad honest but feel moral obligation to be honest...
1
We made our way to the 2am Dessert bar on a Saturday night, around 7.30pm only to be told that children are not allowed on Friday and Saturday nights. If this is restaurant policy so be it but it is not written anywhere on the website or on the facebook page. Wasted effort on our part to get there and very poor service not to let potential customers know
5
came here at prime time on a Sunday night without a booking and were very lucky to get a table. This place was on the bucket list as it is the home of Masterchef dessert queen Janice Wong. We were told it was the last time this tasting set was on the menu and next week the world would be seeing an all new one. 8 Dessert courses in one go - I was slightly worried I would go into sugar shock, but I was fine: the selection was varied, exciting and the portions were nor too small & not too big. It started with a bang with an in-mouth explosion (lemon Explosion, great talking point experience), then Choc Vinegar (too much vinegar really for my taste), Texture of Corn (interesting and odd tastes), Basil White Choc (absolutely fantastic combination of tastes&textures), Chilli Choc (this was the king indeed), Blackforest Cornet (cracking not gobsmacking though), Eat Me Drink Me (not sure whether this one worked on me), and Pure Imagination (signature choc bonbons which looked extremely impressive but I didn't manage to try them due to dessert overdose).Presentation, organisation, plating and quick serving spotless. Some of the ingredients tasted noticeably like they had been prepared well earlier and cooled a while. Great teas to accompany and got many refills. Also had a scrumptious cocktail. Great experience and gets a 5 star for the fun, even though the actual tastes did not always live up to the other elements. Happy with value for money though.If Janice is reading: I wonder whether olfactory sense could be explored more..
3
The one place I really wanted to visit and try the amazing looking cassis plum from master chef... What a let down. The star dish was very average and the other dish were also nothing special. But I still have faith and if Janice is reading this, I think it's just your staff not having the passion nor the perfection to make and plate those great looking desserts.
3
It is a nice lounge to hang out at late night with some drinks and dessert. However, the main premise, the dessert itself was average. It is not up to the hype it promised. The chocolate dessert cake was common and the Cassis Plum was too predominantly sour. Lacking of balance
5
We had heard about Janice Wong and her amazing dessert, the cassis plumb so we visited her 2 am Dessert Bar in Holland Village and ordered the cassis plumb dessert. We were delighted with the tangy yet very balanced flavour of the cassis plumb dessert. The coffees were great too. It appeared that there were a few Aussies there at the same time and we were all ordering the same dessert! No wonder after it had been featured on Master Chef in Australia the week before
4
We went to her dessert bar in Hong Kong, met Janice in real person and did enjoy the desserts. So we had high expectations when we visited her dessert bar in Singapore, which were met. The Singapore bar had more choices than HK one, if not mistaken. Although not known by my SG colleagues, it was still fullhouse at 11PM on Friday evening when we visited this place. The waiting time was generally longer than eating the dessert lol. But you could say, you ate with your eyes (beauty and deliciousness)
4
If you are a dessert person and looking for something different coz you have taste it all then this the restaurant to go. Took some H2O chocolate and it was good. There was a lot of texture on the plate.
5
Visiting the 2am bar was high on my 'To Do' list for Singapore after seeing Janice Wong and her Cassis Plum dessert on Masterchef Australia. We made a reservation for 3pm on a Saturday afternoon which turned out to be the perfect time as we were the first guests and they were still happy to seat us even though we turned up 30mins early. We ended up sharing 3 desserts - the Cassis Plum which was nice if you like a sweet/sour taste; the Truffle Infinity with a delicious basil ice cream; and the 2am Fonffle (a waffle with blood orange ice cream). All three were around S$20 each, and when we added a glass of wine and a coke for my travel companion the total bill came to $99 (including the Service Charge & GST which they always add later - I don't know why they just can't include it in the prices!).Anyway, aside from the expense, each of the dishes were impeccably presented and absolutely delicious! My favourite being the Fanffle waffle. If it wasn't for the price I would've ordered another!Each dish is made whilst you wait - if ordering the Truffle Infinity then order a drink as this one takes 20mins to make. Overall, I was very happy and would recommend it to any dessert connoisseur
3
We ordered their 8-course dessert degustation menu, for $68++ per person (everyone on the table needs to order if going with this option). The snacks were small portions of $15-20 each and the liqour prices were on par with fine dining establishments. Total bill for 3 - $393.Desserts - We liked maybe 3/4 out of 8 and were blown away by none of them. The presentation was great but the taste wasnt anything unique. Atleast 4 desserts were chocolaty so you need to be more creative in a degustation menu.Service - slow and confused. The server re-confirmed 2-3 times on what we ordered. The ice bucket for wine took a long time coming. Not impressed.Decor - a small chick restaurant but nothing close to fine dining. Value proposition is poor and the service is average. This is one of those 'wannabe' places which pretends to be up market but simply isnt. Overall 2.5/
3
My wife and I went for an after dinner date evening with the idea to get dessert and see what the buzz was about. The place is on the 2nd floor and the entrance is well hidden until you discover that its rather exciting opened by this door button which then slides an electronic door open that then leads to a flight of stairs. The space is broken up into 3 sections. A bar on the left. In the centre a long raised table with bar stools and on the left next to the windows are booths which you apparently need to reserve (we didn't), so settled for the long shared centre table. The crowd was mostly couples and tended towards the young. Its also a bit loud, but otherwise it had a nice ambiance. The menu is mostly dessert with maybe 6 savory items, plus various drinks. I was intrigued by the churros and ordered those with a dark chocolate caramel dip. I also ordered their signature dish called Chocolate H20. My wife ordered three scoops of sorbet. All in all we had 3 desserts and the bill came to about $54 which I thought was quite steep - even for Singapore.Anyway, onto the desserts. The churros were excellent and came piping hot. The dipping sauce could be better as it had a slightly bitter after taste. Next time, I would opt for the milk chocolate sauce instead. Then came the Chocolate H20 which is their signature dish. Its hard to describe but it looks like a chocolate mousse that has been rapidly freeze dried with a chocolate ice cream center. It also had a side of yuzu sorbet. Full marks for originality, I've never seen anything like it. The sorbet was fabulous but the main chocolate was good but not extraordinary. Based on the strength of the sorbet, my wife ordered another round of sorbets: yuzu (again, and it was excellent), mango (the flavor of the day, also excellent), and chocolate ice cream (which tasted just like my churro dipping sauce, not so great).However, dessert aside there was a steady stream of people coming in and out and yet we never felt hurried to leave. The service was friendly and efficient. Everything was good, except for the main dessert. That plus the expense made me think that this place while very cool to visit, and hang out, just wasn't great value for money and hence the lower overall rating. The sorbets, churros and service however are worth coming back for
1
Hoped after seeing on Masterchef that it would be nice, but boy was I wrong. Cassis plum was edible but the other two dishes were a complete and utter mess. Heavy handed on flavours that clashed as opposed to singing together in a sweet melody. The advice would be to just don't go there. Remember the nice dish you saw on TV and imagine you had it, as after you attend these dreams are bitterly shattered
5
INSANE FOOD!!!! we started off with the savouries which were amazinf!!! Followed by a range of desserts to share among the family... i cannot tell you enough how amazing the food AND service AND interior designs are. From the moment we walked in, we were enlightened with genuine, honest and lovely staff members and a great atmosphere. You must go!!
3
Went here with some friends in Sept 2015. We had read fabulous reviews and thought while we are in Singapore we should try it out.The desserts we had were trying way too hard to be out there and different.We couldn't finish one it was the tastes were just a little too weird. We had matching cocktails they were yum. The staff weren't the keenest hospitality staff which is not something I came across often in Singapore. They really need to cheer up and do their jobs properly. It is far from cheap- don't go there if you are on a budget.All in all I am glad I went but won't be back
5
Other reviewers have already captured what stands out to me: this is not a cheap place to eat but the flavours are amazing. I'm not a dessert person normally but I went back for a second dessert! It's true that the staff are more focussed on their products than their patrons, however only an obsessive attention to detail could produce these kind of desserts. We watched one staff member QAing a plate at the pass and laboriously removing half a teaspoon of something that she obviously thought upset the delicate flavour balance.A couple of things that might might be helpful to other travellers:this is not far from the Holland Village metro stop, but it still is quite hard to find, go right to the end of a little laneway off Lor Liput and it's on the left upstairs. It is also hard to get a table, so either make a booking or go first thing after they open.Overall, not cheap but an amazing flavour experience; I'd definitely recommend it for a special treat for foodies
3
Prices of a fine dining dessert bar but not matched by the level of service. I asked the first staff to recommend a drink to go with my 3 course degustation and he just ran off without saying anything. Another staff then came and recommended a sake. It's quite a pricy small glass of sake at $17 and actually didn't really go with my desserts. Nevertheless, I did enjoy some of the desserts - the matcha tart was delicious. Unfortunately didn't get to try the Cassius plum which everyone raves on about from Masterchef as it wasn't part any of the degustation. However the 'Apple gold' was quite similar in terms of concept and was pretty good too.
2
Its tucked away in Holland Village and a real pain to look for on a hot afternoon but find it we eventually did. In terms of decor it is not extraordinary and sadly for all the hype the same can be said for what it offers. Of the 5 dishes we ordered - one order was incorrectly served. In the end only one dish tantalised the taste buds. Should you go? Its down to personal taste so you'll have to decide. All the same it is a long way to go and the devil to find....and its expensive
5
Janice Wong and her team are dedicated to progress. The desserts are creative & inspirations to other chefs and home cooks.
A must place to visit for every sweet tooth around the globe.
5
2am is everything you hoped a dessert bar would be. Cool décor, an even cooler playlist and art on a plate. We ordered four desserts and shared them between the two of us. Beautifully plated, with interesting flavors and textures. We (attempted to) dissect them like Masterchef judges, but really we just wanted to lick the plates. We marveled at the Isomalt décor and snuck fan glances at Janice Wong and her team at work. 2am is achingly hip, expensive but totally worth it. We enjoyed every second
2
We planned this visit from the UK having seen it featured on Masterchef Australia. We arrived at around 4pm planning to try the High Tea so that we could sample a few creations. We were told by the waitress that most of the menu was unavailable! As we were about to leave a chef came over and offered to put something together for us! It was a very cobbled together effort that bore no resemblance to the menu or to the many lovely images displayed on the website! A real shame! Seemed a bit pointless to open the bar if there was nothing available on the menu. It was "desserted" and deservedly so!!
3
Arrives at about 4pm and there was one other table. We asked for the two desserts featured on Masterchef and they were amazing. Cassis Plum and Chocolate H2O - The texture was incredible! Like a liquid Twirl. We were pretty much ignored by the staff though and stuck our heads into the kitchen to get the attention of the waitress so we could pay the bill. Soft drinks were also post-mix, not bottled.
5
Quite something. They obliged in holding a reservation at midnight for a traveller which was extremely useful given the concern of encountering a fully booked establishment on arrival. Tucked away in a corner of Lorong Liput up a flight of stairs - has a good buzz. The place is comfortable and inviting all at once. In a relaxed environment their staff move around efficiently preparing what can only be described as enchanting deserts. Very tasty and well balanced especially with their suggested pairings. We tried Cassies Plum and Chocolate H2O. No complaints, very nice and fun to eat. The Ume Cocktail the suggested pairing with Cassies Plum was particularly brilliant. Certainly recommend this establishment as a great place to wind down the night.Awesome

I went as soon as it opened at 3pm to avoid evening crowds. The lady who greeted me was quite friendly and attentive, however there were two others at the bar who never in my whole time there acknowledged me (I was the only person in the restaurant at the time). From Masterchef I ordered the cassis plum dessert and a Yuzu drink. It arrived relatively promptly and looked spectacular! However, if I were a judge on Masterchef, I would have been disappointed. The casing was inconsistent, there were any real strong flavours. I felt like I was eating a weakly flavoured sorbet with some rice crispies. I tried to like the flavours, but couldn't really. The last shock came as Singapore advertises its pricing without service charges or taxes. So my $40 dessert and drink went to $44 then $47. And let's face it, it really was not worth that much. My room service fondant was much more satisfying
4
We stopped in at 2am Dessert Bar on the recommendation of a friend and it was delicious!We had the Shades of Green (think pistachio, gula malaka and meringue) and the Truffle Infinity (chocolate, mousse, gold and just incredible!). It wasn't cheap, at around $47 for the two desserts but it was very good.It's a bit of a hike out to Holland Village, but worth heading out there for some of the great little eateries in the area
3
Hidden behind a mirrored door at the back of another bar downstairs. I went with a couple of friends for late night dessert and drinks. We had the green tea tart with the sake (but the sake was out of stock), the cassis bombe and tiramisu with the red wine suggestion (the red wine tasted like Ribena, not a compliment to the average tiramisu at all.)We also had the mac & cheese with hard overcooked/microwave flavoured pork bits, the beef cheek croquettes (which were bid round balls only containing meat, no potatoes as is normal in a croquette I thought) and calamari with peas (odd combination and a very small plate.)Drinks-wise, we had a bottle of the chateauneuf du pape (S$110), not a good one in my opinion but seemed to open up after a while (well it's either that or the vodka (REYKA - very good with the vanilla pod) and sake that went before it.)There's a nice buzz about the place, the service is hit and miss. It's an expensive place (abt S$416 for 3 people) and I can't recommend in all honesty
1
I used MRT for a long to visit Holland Village because I expected to eat desert 2am but it was closed. It was too being exhausted. I do not why is it too famous so all are busy to open the shop? Please give me information if somebody knows
4
If you are into Desserts then this is the place for the experience.First, getting the place, it is around the corner from the exit from the MRT. Upstairs above the local bar and you have to go around the corner to find the entrance.We've booked a table and got seated on time as we arrived a bit early. Once we got seated we were served the menu and we couldn't decide first on what to drink and then on what to eat.Do come with space for your dessert here. We've had the Plum Cassis desert which was worth the experience. The Chocolate tart with ice cream, probably the lightest base which was one of the best we've tasted. The white wine with the chocolate tart was an excellent pairing. Churros and coffee was also a nice end to the evening, chatting until we were finished and not being chased for turning the table which was good
4
restaurant is very low profile and not easy to find at first. quite small yet funky interior, the desserts are truly amazing. enjoyed the signature dish cassis plum and the chocolate H2O. if your around, i'd highly recommend trying the venue!
3
Service was bad. Servicers basically give u the menu or bill but eventually forget to attend to u. It wasn't even full house. The lack of attentiveness n warmth in the crew really spoils the experience. Dessert is interesting but not great. Don't think I'll return again.
1
I'm from Malaysia. I love food .. I always go around to try ... I found 2am dessert from Instagram.. The dessert in pics so interesting and look good. So I decided to make a trip here ..Seriously , so disappointed.. The service is so bad and they have minimum spending. I never had 'warm' ice cream in my life.. So interesting yea and this 3 little small scoop 15sgd. We had tiramisu as well .. Overrated . Is just a very bitter tiramisu .. And the presentation is so so horrible .. My friend said it look like a xx in toilet bowl Another two dessert we had ..Speechless If u decide to try .. I would say .. Good luck

We decided to visit after seeing Chef Janice Wong on Masterchef Australia and we're glad we made the effort to find it.When we arrived we hadn't had a big dinner so we initially ordered the tacos and these were outstanding. You'd probably only find better in Mexico.We then ordered the Cassis Plum dessert which was featured in the Masterchef episode and it was outstanding. The technicality of every little element composed together to make such an intriguing dessert dish was really quite incredible. The balance of flavours was perfect and the whole experience of finishing the plate was really quite enjoyable.2am is located in a really cool part of Singapore amongst a great vibe in Holland Village. From what I could see, it would easily be worth making a night out of exploring Holland Village and the shops and restaurants it has to offer with 2am being your final destination.Sure, it's a little pricey by Asian standards, but when your getting the best desserts Asia can offer... It's worth it
4
We used to love this place so we're excited to come back. It was good but nothing amazing and nowhere near as good as it used to be. Professional service staff have been replaced with what appears to be soulless students. I was quite surprised how much they rely on a microwave - quite disappointing to see
5
Like other reviewers we found out about 2am courtesy of Masterchef and booked to come here while visiting Singapore. The only disappointment was that I had interpreted their menu to also have savouries ... Which was a silly assumption given the title ... The focus is definitely on sweets. If we were going again (which I would on a return visit) I'd make sure I had a light dinner somewhere else first.However ... In saying that - which was my fault - the desserts were AMAZING. It was difficult to select just one from the menu. The degustation would be a great option - but wasn't available the night we dined. Between the two of us we had the chocolate truffle infinity - which was beautifully balanced with the basil sorbet and a red miso caramel - which had a really interesting blend of flavours. The staff were friendly and obviously proud of the publicity which has come from Masterchef. The cafe is trendy with the most interesting tables made with painted chocolate ... They had me intrigued.It's not a place we would have found just by wandering ... Thanks to Masterchef for bringing it to our attentio

Like many Australians I became aware of the 2AM Dessert Bar due to Janice Wongs' appearance on Masterchef. The contestants had to re-create her Cassis Plum dessert.The bar is located at the end of a short street in Holland Village above an open drinks bar. It is a bit drab of an area and the narrow bare staircase doesn't feel much better. However the space the bar occupies is very modern and chic.We were created extremely pleasantly by the staff, all three of them. We were immediately seated and drinks menu's and of course the dessert menu's were provided. The drinks menu felt somewhat limited. Most bases were covered, wine, spirits, beer, cider etc but just too limited choice (3 beers, 1 cider).We started by ordering the cheescake and of course the Cassis Plum. The cheesecake was good however certainly not the best I have had. The Cassis Plum was unique, challenging and thought provoking. Its certainly not your typical dessert. It is quite tart. The flavours are good but as a dessert we found we were searching for some sweetness for balance. We shared this dessert and both agreed we wouldn't be able to finish one by ourselves as the tartness would ge too much. There is no doubt there is genius in this dessert, but maybe flawed genius.We decided to order a chocolate praline cake with popping candy and the tiramisu. The chocolate cake was rich, sticky, slightly bitter from the dark chocolate but still sweet. The popping candy was great fun. Good dessert.The tiramisu was a deconstructed version. The espresso was in the ice cream, the alcohol in jelly cubes, the finger biscuits were cake smothered in deliciously light marscapone cream, and rich dark chocolate powder lavished over the top. When all elements were eaten together it was a familiar favourite. A very enjoyable version but I would still rather eat L'atelier Tiramisu in Clarke Quays versions.Overall I really like this bar. The vibe is modern, the staff are friendly and refined in their service and the desserts are of a high standard. The desserts listed under 'Contempary' are the challanging and exiciting ones. They exhibit an element of genius but aren't necessarily perfect. For a foodie its exciting and it brings back memories of eating Pierre Gagnaire's food. Elements of pure genius pushing boundaries that sometimes blow you away, sometimes make you ponder and sometimes you just don't like. Janice Wong is pushing boundaries in desserts and to my mind thats a great thing

After seeing Janice Wong on Australian masterchef we were so excited to find out that her dessert restaurant was in Holland village, living in HV how have I never seen this place? Voted no1 pastry chef in Asia 2 years in a row it's going to be amazing right?!?!?!? 7 of us decide to go for afternoon tea one Tuesday afternoon to celebrate our friends 40th (one of the many thankfully) After seeing the pictures on Facebook we were all very excited at the prospect of an afternoon of gluttony.We are given the menus and we start to drool. After about 20 minutes we finally get a waiters attention and order the afternoon tea, 'sorry no afternoon tea available we ran out on Sunday', WHAT!!!!Today is Tuesday remember readers and this is supposed to be a specialist dessert/patisserie right?????So we all choose a dessert then onto the drinks, 'decaf coffee please', 'sorry no decaf'. 'Skinny late' asks another 'sorry only fat milk', 'mint tea please is it fresh mint', 'no', 'ok 3 cappuccinos please'! 10 minutes later 2 turn up another 10 minutes no 3rd one arrives, call waiter over ask for 3rd coffee response ' not my fault'!I'm being harsh, the desserts were delicious and very nicely madebut the service and the lack of afternoon tea were a real let down as were the dirty toilets. On the booking we also mentioned our friends 40th birthday thinking hers may come out with a candle and a bit of a fuss or something but it wasn't even acknowledged.Considering the amazing advert Janice had on masterchef I would have thought this place would be absolute perfection and it's just not - a real shame it could be absolutely amazing, we won't be rushing back sadly

We booked here after seeing Janice Wong's dessert on Masterchef. It proved to be a pretty delicious experience. We first felt a little unsettled by the odd entrance and industrial bar-type decor, but the staff were engaging and very knowledgeable. We tried two desserts and then found those so delicious that we had to try another two. We were the first to taste a brand new creation that had only been invented that day - what fun. The staff kept us entertained with their banter and some good conversation. The desserts were a divine mixture of textures and unusual sweet-savoury combinations. We left quite happy we made the choice to visit and we'll definitely be back A fun night out after dinner

After watching Janice Wong's appearance on Masterchef Australia the night before we thought we might treat ourselves to high tea at 2am dessert bar. However it turned out to be a huge disappointment.When we turned up we ordered high tea, and waited in anticipation for the food to arrive. And waited. And waited...45 minutes later, we asked the wait staff where our food was, and was told it would arrive shortly. Duly a plate of cakes arrived, which was very pretty, but wanted the savoury plate first. And so we waited. And waited. 10 minutes or so later, we enquired again and were told the food would be with us shortly, but waited about another 20 minutes before it finally showed up. By this point we were starving and were ready to give up. And the savoury snacks were awful.The menu promised a quail scotch egg, mozzarella muffin, 2am sandwich and another BBQ snack which we didn't know by name. The only one of these we got was the scotch egg which was so overcooked and rubbery you could play tennis with it. It was accompanied by a hugely overcooked 'chicken rice' and a soggy, lukewarm and bland chicken taco. Not good.We complained, and the staff took it away without much acknowledgement of our complaint, and stated that the menu, whilst very specific, was actually subject to change. We were offered replacement (sweet) snacks, but we couldn't honestly bear waiting any longer.Admittedly, the sweet plate was much better, but the cakes and sweets, which were mainly soft and creamy, were warm and soggy by the time we got to eat them because they had sat out for so long.We were therefore incredibly disappointed with our high tea which had promised so much. The staff accepted our complaints, but only offered a $7 discount, which we felt unacceptable considering only half the food was edible. After some persistence and bad customer service (which didn't even provide an apology) they did half the bill, but this couldn't make up for our wasted afternoon

Enjoying unique desserts is such enjoyable time spent with close friends. Yuzi is such a perfect ingredient. Simply in love.

I feel as du the chef brought all of her family from Asia the food was discussting never again its the food that sucks.

Janice was a superb hostess and ensured everyone had a great time.
Greats puddings & desserts!
Highly recommended and worth a visit!

Had a booking through "Hungrygowhere" for a late afternoon treat - supposedly.The place was in a corner of what looked rather down market and dingy. We turned up at the appointed time only to find the place closed and no sign of life anywhere as the adjoining shops/bars/whatever were also closed. I pushed a button, pushed a door, no signs if it was open or not, so I assumed it was still closed.We took a walk in the so called Holland Village neighbourhood and came back 20 minutes later. Still no change in the scenery and again nothing opened when pushed.We took a taxi back to the city and felt cheated and disgusted by such unprofessional conduct by what one may think is a reputable restaurant/dessertbar. We wasted our time and money for the taxi rides as this place is in the suburbs.When in Singapore, there are so many nice restaurants and dessert places to sample. Whatever you do - stay away from "2am Dessertbar", don't even bother. If a place cannot manage its customers or potential customers well, how on earth can it dish up a good dish. No thanks 
5
So you go through a door that has seen better (and cleaner) days, up a tired staircase and enter a rather dingy room with Formica high tables and banquettes facing glass tables with psychedelic diorama dessert-like displays and notice that the funky (yes, in that sense!) chandelier is missing more than half its lightbulbs and you are overcome by misgivings and tempted to turn around and go somewhere else. Resist the temptation!! For when the desserts start to arrive, the shabby interior will fade into the background and the angels will start to sing. I am waxing lyrical because although I do eat the odd dessert, I am not a "dessert person" as such and I was sitting there wanting to order more. These are not your usual desserts, bells and whistles and all included, these are creations that surpass most desserts I have ever eaten and I have darkened the towels of quite a few three stars. The balance of sweet and sour and bitter is superb and almost every one of the 7 desserts we tried left you wanting to have just another spoonful. My own absolute favourite has to be the red miso, which is a dessert by its own admission, but really inhabits an in-between land of which it is undoubtedly king. We know you can do chocolate, we know you can do fruit, but when you can do this, you get Pierre HermÃ© to write the preface of your book because you are his equal, Janice Wong. (But please change your bathroom
5
I don't know how I could express my gratitude to the innovation of the chef on designing the dessert. Usually dessert should matched with dessert wine, but Janice Wong made it good to pair with ordinary wine, and the presentation of the dessert are of international standard.Although the place itself is a little bit too down to earth when compared with the quality of the dessert, it is a place I could hardly forget. Whenever I need to name the best dessert place in Singapore it must be the one

Craving for Dessert around midnight.. My friends intro us to 2am Dessert Bar..It is my first time and lucky we get table with no queue,. Great place but the waitress dont give me good smile..The Dessert is well made. Overall i will come back again. Keep it the good work and create new dessert
4
Very nice and relax place to hang out for couples or friends over atas desserts! Though it may be a little pricy but I love the ambience at this place. My favourite dessert here is hot chocolate served with homemade churros. Do give it a try if you visit this place
5
We ordered a 2am:Fonffle(TM), which describes a fondant-waffle hybrid (the term is trademarked by 2am). The 2am:fonffle (64% chocolate fondant waffle with blood orange sorbet) was orgasmic! The fonffle itself was an art-piece (which looked perfect against the painted table). It came on a plate decorated with lemon and chocolate sauce, and topped with crunchy chocolate balls and pink (icing?) flakes. The waffles were crunchy and fragrant, the fondant was oozing just like it would in a good molten-lava cake, the chocolate was rich but not overly-sweet, and the chocolate balls and icing flakes added a nice crunchy texture to each bite. Not to mention the sorbet was really refreshing on the pallet and went superbly with the chocolate and waffle. The overall combination was just perfect.You can say we are now officially hooked... will definitely have to go back and try more of their menu (*drool*). The fonffle was S$18, and came up to over S$20 after taxes and service charge, but it was worth every cent in our view.Perfect 10 for us despite the price tag!For more info and more food/travel review, refer to our humble blog at https://angiekayexplorer.wordpress.com/2015/01/27/the-best-waffle-ever

Was told of this place by a friend many years ago, about how the Chef prepares the dessert in front of you. Did not have a chance to try it out until recently. Had to do an internet research for images of the dessert prior before understanding their menu. Shades of Purple was the most enjoyable of the three desserts we ordered. Sadly on both occasions we were there, we did not get a chance to witness the preparation. For the price it charges, if it comes with the show (preparation), I would be rather willing to pay for it. But if it just purely for the dessert, I tend to comment that it's over-priced
4
I went here with friends, had no problem getting a table. The food was good and the desserts most of them were very good too. Overall a good time. The Green Tea Tart with Jasmine Rice Sorbet was the highlight as well as the Braised Beef. The Shades of Purple was also very good. The Champagne prices were very reasonable as well, I would go again if I return to Singapore some time in the future
2
I can happily cut off a dessert place from my list, because I am not coming back here.There is no love in serving dessert that tastes so disheartened. To me food is like music that melts your heart. And this fancy dessert bar has paid so much attention in visual perfection that they forgot to add flavor into their food. I liked their music and somewhat their queer decor, but hey! Thats not why you come back to a restaurant. The tiramisu is how you ( or rather I) score a place, and it was just not right. Its quickly made, salty, crunchy and not smooth. I like my tiramisu the traditional way. Their hot chocolate is decent, but doesn't have a good after taste. I liked their hot churros though. For people who like decorative food, come here.
3
We came here in a group and tried 3 different desserts -the chocolate tart with blood orange sorbet, the green tea tart with soy ice cream and the tiramisu. The first one has been on the menu for a very long time -a crowd pleasing classic combining slightly bitter dark chocolate with the tart flavours of the sorbet. The green tea tart/soy ice cream was much lighter but the flavours were well balanced and came together well. The tiramisu was average and not memorable. We would advise to skip it here and perhaps go for one of the more unusual and experimental creations in the "Contemporary" section of the menu - it is a dessert bar after all. In all we were of view that the desserts were made using quality ingredients and were generally very satisfying. The plating of each dessert is done well. Prices are about the same as what you would pay for desserts in formal restaurants in MBS or 5 star hotels in Singapore.Service was however wildly inconsistent. We were attended to by at least 3 different servers during our visit and the level of service rendered ranged from enthusiastic and helpful to professional but indifferent and downright snootiness. We were reminded by a particular server more than once of a restaurant policy which requires a minimum spending of SGD15 a head. Such policies are not new to us but in this case was presented in a manner and tone of delivery which was completely unacceptable. The experience left a sour note in our otherwise enjoyable evening.TIp: I don't find the bar seats comfortable to sit on for long especially when you are having desserts, would suggest to see if you can get the sofa seats
2
Friends were telling me a lot about this place and it seemed hard to get a table Friday night. But when we finally arrived and had some of their desserts we found the taste below our expectations. The atmosphere was exciting and the presentation of the desserts was gorgeous but I don't think that is enough for us to return
3
We went together in a group of 4, so we were able to order a few more on the menu to taste. We order a contemporary Cassis Plum; Red Miso Caramel; Purple; Liquid Nitrogen Cocktail Sorbet to pair with Kohjo Sake. The Cassis Plum was interesting, as it was served on an unusual, almost like an inverted ceramic. The ice cream looked like a plum, and when you scrape for a scoop, it surprised us with a white filling. We thought it was a vanilla ice cream scoop hidden inside, but the texture tasted very much like yogurt. There was also traces of elderflower petals that gives the dessert a slight fragrance. When I order the Liquid Nitrogen Sorbet Cocktail, I was expecting to see a dramatic image of frozen smokes misting through the glass. It came as a simple double-scoop ice cream with 2 shards of shortbread cookie. But I think the ice cream is gthe saving grace. It was like having a 20% alcoholic rum & raisin rushing through my veins. My face was red in less than 3 minutes! The taste needed a few more scoops to appreciate it properly. When we were served the "Purple", we instantly fell in love with it! The watercoloured acrylic block was used to complement the purplish colours on each mini ice creams, and they looked like mini globs of acrylic paints! Maybe that was the concept of "Purple". The flavors have a very nostalgic taste, it reaches the farthest of my mind to hunt for that decade-long memory when I had this when I was a kid. Next, the Red Miso Caramel was our choice dessert - the salted caramel was a delight for our sweetened taste buds. The mustard was infused with yuzu and made into a soft cream, which they described as a meringue on the menu. The whole palette is quite refreshing and we all love the unique combination of caramel, yuzu and mustard. It sounded bizarre but it would change your mind after that. The Kohjo sake wasn't a favorite for 3 out of the 4 of us. The scent smelled like cough syrup mixed with corriander; and taste was too dry on my throat.Overall, the ambient is very cosy, and well-decorated with industrial-liked finishing, and I particularly love the corals they lined up along the black shelves. It's lovely, and I would definitely come again with a bigger group. Price wise it was slightly above the line - we spent about $130 for 5 orders

I was very blessed to have Janice behind the counter during my visit to oversee the show. I was thrilled even more when i discovered that i would also have my own `one to one`pastry chef creating my sweet delights while i sat and watched and took on board a whole lot of tips for my own cooking. Spanish pastry chef Carmen Rueda had recently started working at 2am dessert barâ€¦..Straight from heading up the pastry section at Heston Blumenthals Fat Duck restaurant OMG , How good is this meal going to be ? Had i died and transgressed over into Sweet heaven ? So on with the show and my quest to eat all of Janice`s Desserts on tonights menu

trolling along Holland Village after dinner meant the discovery of a beautiful bar located on level two, a fully glass-encased bar that piqued our interest. So that was how we stumbled upon 2AM Dessert Bar, located at 21A Lorong Liput, Level 2, Holland Village, Singapore 277733 and the number to dial is 6291 9727. It opens only at 6.00pm in the evenings and closes at 2.00am, true to its name.The interior is a lovely shade of sleek white, with chic bar counter and cushy beds for cuddling on while dining or having drinks. It was a classy joint for chilling out in sophistication, and one could literally kick off the heels and relax.We had cocktail drinks only - a pity we just finished dinner, because the food menu here looked tempting; furthermore we'd heard about Chef Janice Wong's culinary prowess.The Kir Royal (SGD$15.00) - Creme De Cassis and Sparkling Wine - is a sparkling and smooth blend of sweetness, easy on the throat but the flavor lingers in one's mouth to tease the tastebuds further. The Madras (SGD$15.00) - Cranberry and Orange Juice with Sparkling Wine - a fruity mixture tossed into a sensational swirl of reddish sea, taking the tastebuds by sweet storm.Lovely experience, chilling out at this sleek bar. We would definitely be back to try their savoury and sweet food items.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/05/drinks-at-2am-dessert-bar-holland.htm

We have heard of this bar through friends as well as the numerous time we read about it and its award winning pastry chef in magazines. Finally we decided to visit the bar with much high expectations. The bar is located in the very charming Holland Village which has a lively vibrant vibe on the weekends. The bar is at the end of the street away from the crowd. Designed like a bar, the interior is dark and modern. There are cocktails available but we just wanted to try the dessert. Being chocolate lovers, we shared the chocolate cake which was divine, dark and very satisfying. We are ordered the hot chocolate which is one of the best we have tasted. We had a lovely experience here. The staff was helpful and the atmosphere was relax. We will come back again to try out the rest of the dessert creations

Found this place from a best friend and yet, it was becoming our favorite place. Located on Holland V, even tho hard to reach, but it's TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!!It becomes a regular place for me, and I even celebrated my birthday there. Tried almost everything on the menu and nothing fails me
5
found out this place thru hungry go where, its located at holland village. the place was cosy and unique even the dessert was marvelous. its was our first time to try out fusion desert, its sooo nice and delicious. its totally recommended for couple or a group of friend who just intend to find some place to chill out this place is the right place without going to town area
5
Great desserts, excellent service, awesome atmosphere, but pretty steep on the price tag!
Would recommend 2am for special occasions though~

It’s located in the Holland town, where you go there for late walk and for bars.The location of this place it not fancy and it has no view at all.They have strange seating and I think you should reserve the these kind of seats before.It’s nice to go for a late dessert

Visit: http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/07/2am-dessert-bar.html for full post This dessert hideout at a secluded corner of Holland Village had been on my list since it was opened years ago. The chef-owner Janice had won numerous awards for her pastry creations. However, there seemed to be less positive reviews than negative ones.Some felt that the quality/portions of the desserts did not justify the expensive price tag while some felt the service was lacking. Finally mustered the necessary courage to visit and well, our experience was not fantastic but not too bad.The Red Miso Caramel ($15) with mustard crumble sparked my curiosity as saltish desserts often excelled well than purely sweet desserts. The miso lemon foam was robust enough to pair with the slightly tangy mustard yuzu meringue, though my partner found the match rather odd. This interesting dessert would not dull your taste buds, even though the mustard taste was faint.This Southeast Asian style dessert is named "Shades of Green" ($14) had nothing to do with trees but 2Ps--pistachio and pandan. The pistachio sponge and coconut mousse were quite forgettable, but what I remembered was the sweet and aromatic pandan gula melaka custard. Overall not too dense nor overly sweet. If you like kaya toasts or nyonya kuehs like ondeh ondeh just like me, you might love this oneThere was a petite tasting menu, from which we ordered the sticky toffee pudding. But at $10 for a small slice, it was pricy and I should have stuck to the regular menu.With some wacky combinations of ingredients, I would not say that the desserts are extremely overpriced but more or less, on par with most western restaurants and even cafes here.At least they are not boring repetitions of molten lava cake, creme brulee or apple crumble. That said, don't be like me who wanted to save money by ordering the cheaper petite tasting creations. If you wish to go, do check out their website calendar as their opening days are irregular

I arrived quite early in the evening on a Friday, the place was still empty. I sat by the bar and ordered the fries with dip a great cherry beer, followed by the perfectly cooked chocolate jam tart. The place is quite pricey, but was worth it for the desert part. The atmosphere is pleasant, though I tend to agree with the previous reviewer that it is quite cold. Overall I enjoyed it and would return
1
Being a Singapore resident, had heard rave reviews in newspapers and such over time and was excited to try. Even know someone who works for the chef so had great expectations. Was utterly disappointed. Too pretentious and overpriced with not much to boast. The decor was cold and frigid. The staff were half asleep and had to remind you that a minimum spend of $50 was required for a table reservation. The food was really very mediocre. Probably got great reviews because it is pricey and things associated with pricy-ness are regarded as "premium" and "good" in Singapore as a status symbol even if they aren't very good. Won't come back

This is a great concept café and the lack of available seating is testimony to it’s popularity. We arrived at 9:30am without reservation and could only be accommodated at the bar area… all the cushiony lounges were either reserved or taken.I love desserts, and really wanted to love this place. The menu is amazing, and everything on it sounds incredible. But I have to be honest… the actual servings weren’t as “wow” as they sounded on paper. Still very good… just not as good as I was expecting.And the prices… yikes… $18 for what was essentially some decorated cake. Obviously this place isn’t lacking business, so people must see the value, but I wouldn’t return based on the prices alone. I’d rather visit a regular late-night café and order some coffee and cake

This restaurant is helmer by an award winning dessert chef. The concept of just desserts and drinks place make this an after dinner place.The decor consists of various bar tables with high bar stools for the drink crowd and cosy reclining seating with low tables for couples to recline and share dessert and drinks or just hang around.Our party of five came to try the desserts, as we don't drink. We had the cheese cake, the chocolate cake, the basil white chocolate dessert, the hot chocolate with churros and chicken bites.Everything was TOO SWEET (except the chicken of course). Cloyingly sweet. There was hardly any taste besides SWEET. Go if you like things sweet, really sweet. But if you're looking for more interesting desserts which are not overpoweringly sweet, you might want to look elsewhere.To each it's own.

Read about 2am Dessert Bar on TimeOut Singapore and having a massive sweet tooth, I had to drag my boyfriend here on our two-day trip to the city. After taking a long time to find it (it's at the very end of the road, hidden above a bar), unfortunately, the menu was just a little bit too "out there" for me (perhaps too gourmet for my palatte, although I am fairly adventurous when it comes to food!) I loved the ambience, and sunbed-esque chairs, and the waiter was incredibly helpful, but it just didn't seem worth it to me. As another reviewer has said, maybe good if you're trying to impress a date (and have cash to burn!

Marvellous arrangement of highly desirable ice creams, cakes and God knows whatever sweet stuff they have here, on designer plates. You will simply love whatever you decide to order here and I strongly recommend you nice guy travellers to bring along your better halves along to enjoy the deserts and coffees here. Your better hallves will only give in to you after the visit here. I know mine did! These are Honorable words from an Honorable man

Yes, we made a reservation and were glad that we had for a busy Friday night. The owner came over and introduced himself, explained some of the desserts for us (as the explanations on the menu are very vague eg Chocolate and Evian). The big hit on our table was the Popcorn which contained no popcorn yet all 4 teaspoons either tasted of butter, salted, caramel or sugar popcorn - amazing! Churros were light and hit the spot especially dipped into the hot chococate. The salted caramel is so very very good, I would have taken home a tub. Yes, the portions are on the conservative side but I would rather have a small portion of high quality, original to die for dessert than a plateful of mediocre run of the mill sugar. There's always McDonalds with their $3 sundaes around the corner if that's your thing. 2am dessert bar is special, not run of the mill. To top off our night the owner presented us all with a new creation of white chocolate enclosing pop rocks and chocolate ganache. Orgasmic as it melted in my mouth. Superb!!

The service was poor as they have so called "reserved tables for customers" which are able to spend more and their dessert is absurdly expensive.

Ridiculously overpriced and overrated desserts. Absolutely not worth it. I think guests go to 2AM for the ambience and "atas" (high-class) factor. Excellent service does not make up for the poor quality of food. Don't ever go there.

Really uncomfortable chairs but desserts were good. May have been because I'd had too much champagne by then... hic!

expensive desserts that fail to deliver, inattentive and unfriendly (almost rude) staff and noisy ambience. Quite stressful to dine there.

Cozy place with much needed privacy & space! Hire more service crew however!

My Partner and I visited the 2am dessert bar and had a rather good experience. Although we did not make a reservation, we were provided with seating by the bar. The desserts are rather pricey, your looking at about $15 SGD + for a basic dessert, but they are very delicious. Definitely worth while visiting once, to see what all of the fuss is about

I went here very recently as i had read about it in my guide book. i was certainly not disappointed with the quality of the desserts but certainly the quantity. There were about 5 of us and we ordered 4 desserts but every portion was so tiny that we hardly felt satisfied. The hot chocolate in particular was delicious but i would recommend everything on the menu. If you can afford to be extravagant go for it - the location - holland village - is also a very central one and so it is a good hang out, although one night at 1am i tried to get in and they told me the kitchen had closed! So for a 2am dessert bar that is rather disappointing, i sure hope that does not happen again

It's a nice place to chill out if u dun mind spending $50 just on dessert! I meant each desert on average cost about $20. Frankly it's ok if you r there to impress your date or girlfriend but I find it just a tad too pricey for a little sharing of desert. Hence, I will visit tis place just once for the experience & avoid going there again

Excellent, excellent, excellent! My friend and I walked into 2am close to closing and were surprised by the warm welcome and their rolling out of "the red carpet" to serve us. Despite having walked in 5 minutes before 2am (when they close--hence the name), the staff were extremely friendly and insisted that we make ourselves comfortable and relax. And relax we did. We lounged out on their bed-seats and were introduced to all the desserts on their menu. We choose a selection of their exotic flavored sorbets (blood orange, fruit of the forest and jambu) and the chocolate tart. Everything, including each sorbet flavor was made fresh by the chef as soon as we placed our order. When we received our dishes, the only words we could utter were "Mmmmm" and "Oh my God! This is fantastic!" Tasting a spoonful of each sorbet was just like taking a bite directly out of the fruit it takes its flavor from. Absolutely delicious and refreshing! The chocolate tart was equally as amazing. Digging in, velvety ribbons of runny chocolate oozed out of the tart while decorative drizzles of salty caramel served to elevate the tart's heavenly sweetness and decadence. 2am is an absolute must for any dessert lover who finds themselves in Singapore

Fancy for sweet dessert late in the night? Then 2am is the place for late-nighters like you. The dessert is nothing to shout about but it is undeniably a cool place for a night-out with your friends. There's nothing like dessert and wine to end an otherwise boring day at work

Nice and comfy environment...pretty tasty deserts to boot!

Loved the chocolate (warm bitter) + orange sherbet (cold sweet) combi... definitely a must try but is on the high end for desserts...
