A place where the kids will have load of fun enjoying the handicrafts while the adults could find some space to chat and eat.

Pleasant visit. Plenty of crafts for kids and parents to do together. Goodies from the 80s bring back good memories from the school days..

Eatplaylove Cafe, located conveniently near Jln Sultan, is a must visit place for parents with art/craft loving kids. Kids can purchase a set of art/craft materials for a nominal SGD 5 and then proceed to a kids corner. The food is good, with a Thai/Italian touch, and reasonably priced. Overall, a highly recommended place. Cafe staff is very helpful and pleasant.

Was here for nephew brithday. Food wise, were so so only. The mini chicken was rather overly cooked, too dry and hard. Skewers, not so bad. Thai green curry, can consider to re-order. Pasta nothing special. However, 1 dish which I highly recommended is their Coconut Ice Cream. A kids heaven as they can free roam around to play some crafting where parents can enjoy their food

They served thai and western food which are reasonably good, except they were quite heavy on the basil leaves in the dishes I had. Great place for kids, paid $5 for 2hrs of craft play which really keeps your kid occupied. Parking is a problem during peak periods though

Very originally, truly authentic! This place offers you the luxury of eating in peace again! Finally someone catered to sleep deprived, time savaged, perpetually used to 'eating under duress' PARENTs :)Food is great and reasonably priced. You pay a small charge to let the kids get a crafts set and let them play on separate crafts table. Love the concept and couple of hours of peace it gives you before you return to your madness.

Eatplaylove is an interesting concept of a cafe. Incredibly kid friendly, it encourages its patrons to explore creativity and crafts. It’s easy to see why its craft corner is so attractive to both kids and adults. Within minutes of entering the cafe, the girls in my group immediately gravitate to the colourful corner for some fun and selfies. The cafe features casual vintage decor and offers vintage knick knacks that some of us adults would find nostalgic. And when its time to leave, there’s some crafts on sale so you can take some back with you

We had a gathering at this cafe yesterday. As advised by the website, I made a reservation for 5A and 2C, and requested for 2 baby chairs at the same time.I was not happy when I was brought to the table and realized that it was short of one chair. I expressed my dismay and one of the waitress (a local auntie, I believe) retorted back sayimg that she just need to confirm the number of pax. I was not too happy with her response and asked her back what is 5+2? Isn't it common sense? She said she did not know Maths and just want to confirm. I shot back saying if she does not know Maths, how is she going to confirm? Then she walked off.It was fortunate that our spirit was not damped by such poor and unprofessional attitude because the other 2 foreign waitresses were much more friendly and helpful, especially in recommending the dishes. Food is of reasonable quality and we have no complaints on the prices. The kids also enjoyed themselves with the arts and crafts and made some 3D artwork and 2 fans over the 1hr session. One of the friendly waitress also came and offered plastic bags for us to bring the artwork home! What a pleasant experience!However, when we were leaving the cafe, that auntie was checking sith her colleagues if we have made our payment and after confirmation, she bidded us farewell in a unhappy tone. And yes, you are right that I am giving this dining experience a low rating because of our poor experience upon our arrival and departure.

This place is very kid friendly. Mainly an arts cafe where many of craft materials are on sale besides the usual cafe food. Coffee is terrible though.I recommend this place if you got kids and need some timeout bonding with them over craft and some dessert

It has a different concept from the other cafe, there is an area where little kids can do some art. The place is very lively and is suitable for children. Reasonable price but you will have to check if there's any private event during the day. Parents can book the place to hold birthday parties as it's really a nice place for children to hang around. Satisfied with the waffle ordered, will visit again though it's kind of far from Bugis MRT station but definitely worth the find. You may check out other cafés nearby and Haji Lane for some vintage shopping experience
