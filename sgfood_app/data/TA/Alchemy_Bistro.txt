Chilled, relaxed, friendly and a great place for conversations. Great drinks and food. It feels like the sort of place that if I lived here it would become my local bar.

My husband and I visited Alchemy twice during our 8 nights at the nearby Park Regis, it is only a few minutes walk from the hotel and a great little place for a nightcap or if you can't be bothered venturing far from the hotel. It is tucked away amongst buildings and all the seating is in an undercover walkway, it's very casual and relaxed and the music is good. They have a good range of beers, limited selection of wine and snacks. It's a quirky little bar and a nice alternative to the glitz and noise of nearby Clarke Quay, it has a genuine down-to-earth vibe

Located between Clarke Quay and the Holiday Inn Express I found this little bar. Very welcoming, the two guys behind the bar were good humoured and helpful. Excellent value during their happy hour(s). No food cooked on site but they have a menu for an inexpensive restaurant nearby. You choose, they order for you and a take away is delivered for you in no time at all and you are welcome to consume it on site.I wish I'd found it earlier during my stay, it was ideal for a post work wind down and I noticed that many others were choosing to do the same
