Compared to the very first time when they open here from another location their services has changed.
Food wasn't as fresh as it uses to be.
Pricing wise is normal as its my favourite restaurant to visit during Chinese New Year.

A restaurant inside the park - served with nice food (most of the stuff are good) but pricey to me. Atmosphere is nice as you are dine in greenly environment.

The restaurant is at a good location. Situated in a park away from the main road, there is a pond just behind it. It is surrounded by greens and the air was fresh. The tables were arranged at good distances, spacious and the environment was comfortable. The waiter was efficient and friendly. He recommended food suitable for our young children. All the dishes were well prepared and tasty. Itâ€™s a perfect place for meals

Even after decades of patronising this Taiwan porridge restaurant, it is always a place for a family meal whenever ideas of where to eat run short. Without booking, we arrived at 6.30pm on Saturday evening and were fortunate to secure a table. With 2 young kids in tow, we ordered dishes that suit their palate:Braised Duck with Tau Kwa****Sweet & Sour Pork***Deep Fried Salted Silver Fish*****Fried Brocoli****Fried French Beans****Bean Curd with Minced Meat****Cai Po Fried Egg****A very satisfying meal although the Sweet & Sour Pork was a little tough. Also remember to ask for less or no salt for the Fried Silver Fish which was crispy and addictive. Lastly, the sweet potato porridge was just right but we did not make good use of the free flow because everyone was on low carbo

Chanced upon this restaurant while strolling through Toa Payoh Park. Always thought that the building has been abandoned since the previous F&B tenant departed. The current tenant was a popular Taiwan porridge establishment at the old National Stadium in Kallang. The nondescript decor and old style tableware brought back memories of the traditional neighborhood Chinese restaurants. The matured serving staff added to the nostalgia. Service was very friendly and helpful with recommendations for lunch. Soon we had a lazy susan full of dishes to accompany the iconic sweet potato porridge. One of the star ingredients was the sambal. It was not thick and pasty but a full flavored and generous smacking of dried shrimps and chillies. It made all the difference to the stir fried kangkong vegetable with cockles.The cold chicken feet with Thai sauce was a rare treat. The homemade deep fried tofu wore a crispy coat over the melt-in-your mouth soya beancurd. The omelette had a generous serving of oysters. We were not big fans of the signature braised pork due to the rough fibrous texture and the braised pig intestines with salted vegetable could have used more flavor. The boiled chicken was leaner than other versions.It turned out to be a wonderful lunch with the add trip down memory lane of old style Chinese cooking in Singapore

Ok, this is a MUST-go Chinese restaurant. Heavenly tasting and seriously, you will come back again. The porridge is fantastic, and ... like everything just tastes awesome. It is too difficult to describe here, so treat your own taste buds and experience it for yourself!Reserve in advance! This place is constantly crowded especially on weekend! Park at HDB hub and cross over to the restaurant by the overhead bridge. Limited parking space near the restaurant itself..

We have been to this Toa Payoh garden outlet a few times for its famed dishes and porridge . It was a good meal with clay pot fish head, spring onion frog legs and egg omelette. Enjoyed the tasty dishes and the sweet potato porridge was really comfort food. However , we put off by the $1 charge for ice water , which was normally free, but we were not even informed about this charge when orders were made. Aside from this , we had a nice dinner.

Oasis is a well known porridge restaurant with 40 years of history. It moved from Kallang to Toa Payoh about five years ago and the restaurant still draws in the dinner and supper (it remains open till 6am!) crowd. The menu features more than 120 dishes - all good with the free-flow sweet potato porridge, which is brought to your table in a thermal bucket

The sweet potato porridge is kinda overrated. However, the price of the dishes is reasonable in a good restaurant setting. The lala (seafood) and dishes were fresh and tasty. The restaurant is next to the Toa Payoh Swimming Complex, about 8-10 mins walk from the Toa Payoh MRT

This place opens late at night so it is a good option if you are thinking of fixing your hunger pangs during suppertime. Serves an extensive range of dishes to go with plain porridge. Food quality is good. Service staff quite responsive to our needs. Cost is slightly on the high side
