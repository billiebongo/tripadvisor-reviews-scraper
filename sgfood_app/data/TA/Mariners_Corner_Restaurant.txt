Enjoyed a couple of meals here during my overnight stay. The steak, fish and prawns were great. The soups and salad bar makes for a good start. Didn’t try the desserts but coffee was nice.

Free car parking and good food at reasonable prices. Love the salad bar too. Family and I will be back!

My parents came here for their first date 20 over years ago, and did they pick a good place! Came here tonight for dinner and had a wonderful time. The staff are absolutely amazing, providing really good service and genuine warmth and hospitability. Food was also really value for money - got an oxtail stew ($18.50) and a lamb shank ($19.50), both which were generously portioned, and tasted good. For $5.80 more, you get to add a set which comes with free flow salad (not too bad), soup + garlic bread, really tasty dessert and tea/coffee. Decor here is also really cosy, having a 80s vibe. All in all, would definitely come here again for a cosy and tasty meal!

Oxtail stew and ribeye steak are favourites - can't go wrong with theseUsually start off with a dozen escargots and the salad barI will ask for the banana cake - they use pisang raja but nowadays this is rarely availableMy personal favourite is the roast prime rib - only available on Fri, Sat & Sun dinners. Not for lunch.I normally don't want it to be served on a hotplate because it will continue cooking on the hotplate and I don't want the smell to cling to my hair and clothes after dinnerHouse pour is reasonably priced - if 3 or above, just open a bottleGreat for family occasions or even couple having a time outYou can call 62249928 for free parking strictly after 6pm if you are having dinner ther

We had reservations for our group of 10 and were promptly seated. Service was excellent and kept the meal moving. The dinners included salad bar, soup and dessert which were all of high quality. Our group tried a variety of dishes and nobody was disappointed. The steaks came out on very hot plates in the shape of a cow - a nice touch. For the dishes that included a baked potato, sour cream, bacon and chives were also offered. The decor of the restaurant is unique with funny signs and interesting memorabilia scattered throughout the restaurant. The location is very convenient to Singapore General Hospital. There is free parking under the restaurant

I have been coming to this restaurant for about 20 years and it is still mostly the same cosy place. Most of the people bring me here for business lunch but this time I came to celebrate a friend's birthday. The food is excellent and the price is great value compared to restaurants located in malls. Service is generally excellent and there is also a nice salad bar. I would love to come more often. There is also parking below if you come in the evenings

It's an old restaurant tuck away at cantonment road. Deco here is very special. You can find old posters and furnitures. Escargots are really tasty with the deep fried garlic and butter over it! For ribeye steak, portion is generous. The steak is tender and juicy. Service from the staff here are excellent. Highly recommend this place for good food and nice ambience!

Brought a coworker here for lunch. I like the OX-tail stew in a claypot. It's their regular set lunch. Comes with some carrots and mashed potatoes as well as tea/coffee with a piece of cake. Pretty good deal. But need to be there early (11:30am) if you want some quiet moments to talk or discuss matters as the lunch crowd will start coming in at 12 noon

Had the set meals which were tasty. Salad buffet was so-so. Steaks were done very well.Had the garlic & thermidor prawns. We were almost overcharged for the prawns as they wanted to charge us for 7 prawns instead of 5, which was what we had ordered & received. A lot of back & forth before they agreed to remove the extra 2 prawns from our final bill.Otherwise, it was a satisfying meal

The pumpkin soup was nice. Seafood pasta was average and so was the chicken and chips. Salad bar was bland- could add a few more choices. Chocolate brownie was stale. Coffee was good.
2
All of the cheap dishes can only be ordered during Mo-Fr lunch. Dinners and weekends are significantly more expensive.
The dishes we got were a bit too small also in my opinion.
The tee was tasty.

I went to Mariners' Corner last week with 2 friends for their oxtail stew set lunch: soup with bread, oxtail stew with rice and coffee or tea and a piece of cake. The oxtail stew came piping hot in a clay-pot. The meat was very tender and the rich gravy was delicious and flavourful. We could not finish 3 portions of the stew so we packed one and shared the other two. Enjoyable meal, friendly and very prompt service and a lovely retro ambience

Bangers and mash was ample and tasty. Good coffee, expect to pay around $40 Sing for two meals. Best feature was conversation with to owner. Very pleasant fellow. Décor was dated but cozy and service was excellent. A bit out of the way but just a block and a half from the OTRAM SMRT stop . Worth a try for great English breakfas

Shocking. I wasn't surprised that theres 2 consecutive bad reviews, things seem to have went downhill from the last time I was there.I went there for a weekday dinner to celebrate a birthday. When we were doing the reservation, it started not that smoothly. However, we were pleasantly surprised that we were given a corner table. So we thought at first that perhaps the service was better than we thought.Alas, after my gf asked for a cup of warm water, the service went downhill from there. The waitress said that they don't serve warm water. I noticed then that she was gesturing at our table when she chatted with another male colleague.Thereafter, it appears that she and that male colleague ignored our table. Both went past our table without bothering to do water top ups when they were holding the water jug in their hands. When my gf asked for raw sugar, she said wait for awhile and my water was coming. I got frustrated after awhile and asked the Chinese lady for the water and raw sugar and it came quite soon.Terribly apologetic about the good service by the Chinese lady and the lady doing the cashier but the management really have to do something about some of their staff attitude

- the house wine was cold and flat, tasted like overnight wine stored in the fridge. We checked with them, they insisted it was just opened. We are seasoned wine drinker, quite certain it was not freshly opened. - they served fried garlic instead of bacon chips on boiled potato- the 'medium rare' venison steak was overcooked and we had to send it back - tenderloin steak which cost $27 was very dry and tough- pre-Christmas menu (beef fillet) was very thin, dry and bland.Garlic bread was with margarine instead of butter. When we asked them, they insisted it was butter but it didn't taste right.Overall, it was a disappointment. It was not value for money.

- Good place to spend the Sunday night with many or friends prior to your Monday blue. - Suggest to make reservations prior, because the queue maybe rather long. If you sit on the couch, you'll see few families coming in within an hour. o Good ambience. o Delicious food. The garlic bread although looking mediocre, it was an amazing appetiser (considering you're hungry when you walk in). o Escargots were pretty well done. It wasn't hard but right amount of chewiness. Imagine eating cheese nugget that has a texture of rubber. Well done. o Steaks were pretty alright. I did enjoy it a fair bit. However, the gravy was rather a disappointment. x The gravy to top my medium rare steak was red wine mushroom gravy. But there were no slight hints of red wine, wish they would be more generous with the red wine. x The service was quite bad. It's not very negative to the rude side where you just want to flip and walk out the door (I would if I was alone.), But they were not hospitable either. The aunties need more training to be in this kind of FnB services. x Walking in this restaurant, you'll expect it to be expensive. 5 of us spent S$25 per person without beverages.

Went there for lunch recently and their sets are pretty much unbeatable when it comes to price point. Had a steak with soup, drink and dessert for just over $15 per person. Oh and there was free coffee and tea as well. Food was good and service was prompt.

Was around the area picking up some famous ang ku kueh, and decided to head over here for lunch. I've heard alot about this place but never been!We had set lunch, which was really good value for money cos its a 3 course meal - soup, main, dessert and a drink. Food was really home-style type, i had the Fish & Chips while my date had Sirlion steak. Service was fast, efficient and friendly. Restaurant had a very nostalgic, old-school feeling but cosy.Highly recommended! I will return agai

The character and atmosphere of the restaurant;1) Marilyn Monroe, James Dean, “Gone with The Wind” posters. 2) You can imagine how nostalgic this restaurant can be. 3) Chairs are heavy and comfortable. 4) Servers are excellent in their food recommendation.Food; Ox Tail Set Meal (5 Stars measurement)1) Juice Mixed (4/5) – though not fresh cold pressed; but definitely not those cheap kind. 2) Minestrone Soup (3/5) – Chopped mixed vegetables with visible spaghetti.3) Garlic bread (4/5) – Surprisingly buttery, soft and deliciously flavorful somehow.4) Salad bowl (4/5) – Fresh vegetables with appropriate amount of salad dressing. 5) Hainanese OX Tail Soup served in a pot (5.5/5) - Its piping hot fragrance is alluring to the nose. Taste buds danced uncontrollably on my first slurp. It courted my inner most being and almost turned my manhood into a roaring TIGER! Deliciousness! Improvement;1) My table seems a little dark as its not nearing the windows. Air Con was good. Overall has its own signature look and feel. Maybe need some slight renovation or décor stronger theme to attract more crowd.Evening dine in is slightly on the expensive side

A 10% discount for all seafarer's on all drinks & food available.(You need your passport, seaman's book or ship's pass as proof)

Had dinner here a few days ago and the food was unpretentious and good for a relatively modest sum. There was even free parking at the basement if you come early. Will definitely be back.

Good steaks at very reasonable rates. Just go there for the steaks and add on the set meal which comes with a salad buffet, soup, dessert and coffee or tea. You will definitely leave very satisfied.

Went of a dinner and all was very enjoyable and edible, but we were left with the feeling that something was still missing, we felt there should have been more for the money and the potato mash tasted of dried powder.

Really love this restaurant. Reminded me of the 60s and 70s restaurants that I had seen from Local drama shows.The foods were served accordingly. Starter, soup, main course and dessert & coffee.The prices are reasonable and the food served in good quality. Theirs cake , must try.We have a lovely and enjoyable lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Will go back again

This restaurant is typical of the Hainanese-Western restaurants I grew up with, like Jack's Place (which has since reinvented itself) and The Ship. Decor is dated and a throwback to the 80s, but it's also warm, familiar, unpretentious and comforting. We had lunch here and the set meals were very reasonably priced. My mushroom soup, garlic bread (oh so 80s!), sirloin, chocolate cake and tea only came up to about $15.50 after service charge and GST! Service was also prompt, efficient and polite. Nice to finally eat at an unpretentious place with reasonably priced food in Singapore. Excellent

husband brought me here for a dinner date and i was surprised with the whole thing. the ambiance of the restaurant suits my being anything-vintage lover. yet, although the interiors are old, they are clean and doesn't smell old at all.i am not a fan of steak but theirs just tasted excellent and i just couldn't resist finishing the dish i ordered. dessert though is i guess not their specialty but the steaks covered it up very well :)staff are superb in service. very polite and professional, keep it up! will definitely go back for more :

My aunt introduced me to her local restaurant and I was pleasantly surprise. There is a good family atmosphere with the option of salad bar for $5.80. Most of the ala-carte menus are between $18 to $25 and enough options to satisfy different palates. I had the fisherman pan which is a mixture of seafood in white sauce. Yummy. It is within walking distance from Chinatown, Singapore so burn some calories first and enjoy

Not many people know that this is the sister restaurant of the old Vines at Novena opposite the catholic church. Vines is now gone after the enbloc of the old building but the food and theme still lives on in Mariner's Corner. Great food at a very reasonable price coupled with warm and friendly staff. Have been visiting Mariners' Corner with friends and family many times and will continue to visit this place for many years to come
