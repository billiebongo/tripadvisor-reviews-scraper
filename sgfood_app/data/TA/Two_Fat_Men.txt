Great little local spot with very friendly staff. Love the new kitchen menu: simple and delicious. Great burger and veggie burger and love the hand cut fries. They have a kids menu that my daughter loves and very reasonably priced.

Two fat men is an institution at the East Coast where you can meet the entire neighbourhood. The two owners run this place themselves and do everything they can to keep their guests happy. The atmosphere is very welcoming, the food tasty and reasonably priced.

Having been here before, we were looking forward to the steady quality of the fare. The burger was fine, however, the fries looked and tasted like they were the worst remnants of a previous days batch; oily, burnt and generally unappealing. We sent them back.We also ordered a chicken pot pie. The taste and presentation were reminiscent of a Gordon Ramsey spoof; strange presentation without taste hiding a "out of a jar" chicken casserole ...we sent it back..."shame"

I'm sure this place is hopping at night, but I went in the afternoon with my kids and was pleasantly surprised by the food and atmosphere. I had the burger and fries (I think these are the best fries in SG) and was super impressed by the kids meals. Healthy and affordable, but not only did they have the standard, but also came with cut veg and fruit. Exactly what I'd be aiming for at home. It's my understanding that the kitchen was recently under new management and it's definitely run by parents who know what other parents are looking for. Will be a Friday night or Sunday afternoon staple

This is a great neighbourhood pub to visit again and again. The owners are friendly and serve an ice cold beer. The menu is perfect for a pub, you're not getting a huge selection but everything on it is very good in terms of flavour and value

Two Fat Men is a great bar with exceptional burgers. Now you can order Indian, Thai and Japanese from next door. The landlord's are fantastic and create an ambience you struggle to find elsewhere. The regulars are always cheerful and welcome newcomers with open arms. Ample outside seating area too.Great place, if your looking for a place to chill with good beer, great food and friendly company, look no further.

Went for a couple of beers on a Saturday afternoon. The owner was really welcoming and friendly. We had a couple of Singhas which at $8++ were a real bargain. The kitchen opened at 5pm and we ordered burgers. They were really delicious. Had a great relaxing afternoon with great service, food and drinks. Will definitely return

My wife and I ate here on a Saturday night. They had a very simple menu, and a couple of beers with awesome prices on tap. We had sampler platter of sorts. The pork neck was so-so, but the wings were so good we ordered extra. The "fat men" working were very friendly. We'll be back

Two Fat Men is a great neighborhood hangout, whether you want to grab a quick pint or enjoy an evening out. We have been twice in the last month and have enjoyed the service, food and atmosphere. The guys running the place are super nice and thoughtful and welcome families, couples and singles alike! We went for burgers the first time and they passed the taste test, for both adults and children. This weekend we branched out and tried the pork neck sandwich and green curry. The curry was good and spicy! The sandwich was a bit awkward to eat but tasty. Our kids stuck with burgers and Mac-n-cheese. All were satisfied.There is a good selection of drinks, both beer/alcoholic l and nonalcoholic. We will definitely look forward to our next visit
