Quite a cosy place for lunch, food was fresh, staff were friendly and helpful. They will come and help to steam the food after you are done with each "course". A healthy and interesting way to have a meal outside

Sea Tripod Seafood Paradise Located at #01-02, 331 New Bridge Road Dorsett Residence, Singapore. The ambience is laid-back and casual, with wooden tables and benches spread through the restaurant, and there are glass tanks that hold live seafood. Sea Tripod Seafood Paradise imports the freshest seafood it can find and steams it right at your table using state-of-the-art steaming equipment.. During our visit, the restaurant service was pretty slow due to been short-handed I presume. This steam pot concept is that the selection are brought to the table raw. Firstly, the rice grains and chicken porridge were poured into the pot before the lid is placed over it. The waiter will place the ingredients on the lid, before they are covered with a glass cover. Typically, the ingredients are steamed between 2-6 minutes. As the ingredients are being cooked, the juices from the array of steamed food arenâ€™t wasted. They drip into a pot below where congee has been slowly simmering. The end result is a flavourful congee. The congee is rich with the flavours of all the cooked ingredients and this is truly, the best part of the meal. The price may be a little steep but I we dint mind paying for the fresh seafood on offer. Lastly, thumbs up to the service, it is impeccably...very professional and sophisticated, yet friendly. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night. I truly recommend this place. Will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!

I booked the restaurant thru the chope website believing that I am entitled to a 10% discount and a free abalone dish to celebrate a relative's birthday. Someone from the restaurant called to confirm about the discount but said there will not be any abalone dish as the night of the dinner is not the actual birth date. At the end of the meal, I was not given the 10% discoun

My wife and I chose Set A which cost S$48 for 2 persons. It consisted of Salad (one plate for 2 persons), Seafood (prawns, mussels, scallops & fish), Vegetables (corn-on-cob, mushroom, baby spinach & baby cabbage), Meat (chicken & Kurobuta pork belly slices), chicken porridge and dessert. See photos.The food was fresh and very tasty, especially the sea bass fish, the best fish I have eaten. Dessert was average. Waiter Kumar was very pleasant & friendly

The service was super slow. Waited one hour for them to serve 1st dish. Oysters were bad. Took us 3 hours to finish our lunch due to slow service and the restaurant was only one-third filled.Very expensive too . Costs us about $360 for 4 pax

Visited with a work colleague...we were staying at nearby hotel. Surprisingly quiet for a Wednesday. We had the Set B for two at 68++ which was very good value given the quality of the seafood. Seafood was fresh, and simply steamed, with sauces on the side. Also some veggies, pork and chicken plus rice porridge at the end. Good service and can be in and out in an hour if necessary. Will visit again
