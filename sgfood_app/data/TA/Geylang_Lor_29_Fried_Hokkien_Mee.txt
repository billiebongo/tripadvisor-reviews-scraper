Donâ€™t think the taste is worth to wait for almost an hour. No advance information on the waiting time.

The fried Hokkien mee and oyster omelette are great and tasty. However, you have to pay first and sometimes you have a long wait. They will promise the food is coming soon and yet it may take 40min. Too long! A little pricy too.

Very nice local "Hokkien style" fried prawn noodles. Semi wet with seafood and egg. Singaporean Hawker styled in a coffee shop. $6,$8,$15 etc. Quite expensive for local standard. Also have other food like fried carrot cake. Recommend to try.

Get ready to queue to enjoy this fried Hokkien mee. I waited for30 minutes before my turn. Parking also horrible here. It's in some kind of a food court with limited seating. I bought one and took it to eat somewhere else. Very nice indeed.

Ordered a plate of hokkien mee and fried oyster. Was offered a plate of fried oyster that was left by the side, I rejected but the cashier showed bad attitude and wanted me to take it. I rejected and said I'll just have the hokkien mee, she shows further frustrations and said will fry a new plate for me. But I saw her passing that plate of oyster to the kitchen. Several minutes later, a plate of fried oyster was sent out from the kitchen which I have no idea if they merely re stir fried that leftover plate. I just take it.Another several minutes later, the hokkien mee is ready, I took some chilli and was shouted at by the cashier, the cook, and the server of the stall. Had diarrhea in the night on the same day, not certain if it's due to the food from this stall, but it's certainly the worst experience ever

Owing their name to the famous hokkien mee at Lor 29 Geylang, which is called Swee Guan, I doubt they're the same flagship. That doesn't seems to matter after I ate here so many times and found the taste to be even better. Noodle is well fried exuding a rich aroma from the prawn stock, succulent sotong and prawn. A little to the oily side but that's what hokkien mee is all about

in summary, the original stall which is currently run by the brother has a more flavour-ful hokkien mee, as evidenced by the difference in queues. below describes the pros and cons:pros:- generous portions compared to original stall in Geylang Lor 29- lots of prawns and sotong- clean coffee shopcons:- really, really rude and unfriendly boss - separate dish of oyster omelette came very late, we were scolded for even asking if the dish was comingverdict: there are much better hokkien mee around, and unless you stay really near this particular stall, you would fare better travelling to other HKM stall

One of the best fried hokkien mee i have eaten in a while...the sauce is tasty and it coats just nice onto the noodle yum yum, there is a "wok hei' taste to it so you know that the chef really did a good job frying the noodles...dun just take my word for it that it was nice..when i was there abt 5pm on a sat evening there were abt many orders...and it took a while before ours came cos they fry in a batch...my order came after we waited abt 20mins...but the wait was worth it...we order $10 for two to share but if you are hungry, $16 for two should do fine..besides fried hokkien mee, they have fried carrot cake, fried oyster, oyster omelette and big prawn noodle (seasonal price)...drivers, pls be informed that parking here is quite limited...you may have to park further down the road and walk to the coffeesho

This store is located in a coffee shop so no air-condition. Quite pricey for a hawker store.It is well known for their fried Hokkien Mee but we prefer their fried oyster omelette. They also sell fried carrot cake.Overall, the food is very delicious. Worth a try
5
There are many vendors in this place.Just simply walk through the vendor and look/ask them about the food in the menu. They don't speak much English but body language and picturesque menu helps :)My husband had the sweet and sour fish. I tried the seafood noodle and we shared a good stir-fried leafy vegetable dish.It is fairly cheap here.We did truly enjoy our dinner and would come back to try other dishes next time

Ordered from this stall through Uber Eats. Tasted good even if it's not straight from the wok. The fried oyster omelette is good too.

I have visited the stall several times. Always never disappoint me. This is the first time I pack back home to eat and it's as good as dining there. Packed in leaf!

A pretty decent Hokkien mee. The noodles are cooked over a charcoal fire and have an umami lard and seafood taste. Expect to wait a while for your food if you are there during peak hours.
4
Not sure if it's true but charcoal fried, the noodles seem really fragance. However there is always queue and the portion given is not consistent. Sometimes the medium portion looks the same as small.

I normally drop by for takeaway, and really shocked to find that the price has recently increased from $4 to $6

Nothing special about this hokkien mee. Its a long queue everyday but nothing special about the taste. Don't waste your time queuing up for this.

We were staying in hotel upstairs and went try this hokkien mee for dinner.Not so crowded when we are there. But surely, this hokkien mee is very delicious. The prawn and the squid also fresh.$10 for 2 persons is quite pricey, but with the taste, worth the mone

The fried hokkien mee is one of the best I had. Quite pricy for a person share which costed around 6 bucks in a coffeeshop. However, I would think it's worth the price. The sotong and prawns are fresh. It's nice with or without chili. Had a few times and love it. Always my top choices if I happened to be around that area for food. Long queue at times and the parking lot next to the coffeeshop is limited. For the hokkien mee lovers, it closed every Monday. Came a few times quite late at night and the stall is closed. So I guess the stall closes quite early (maybe around 8pm)? So not recommended for night supper :

Every time we head to Singapore we find ourselves at Lorong 29 Fried Hokkien Mee at least once, if not twice during our short stay. It's always been consistent and has that awesome Wok Hei flavour or breath of the wok which is an indication of the level of skill of the chef in being able to achieve one of the foundations of a good wok cooked meal.The noodles are always cooked just right and the seafood by way of the juicy prawns and tender squid is also prepared perfectly. Hokkien Mee isn't the only dish they do there either and the Oluak or oyster omelette is beautiful too.If you're ever in Singapore, this is a must see or taste spot on your adventure the food paradise that is Singapore

Our previous house was just a few streets away, and we have been coming here for the past six years or so.Still consistently good, even after the daughter has taken over the frying. Wait time can be long though, up to 30-40 minutes. It has the nice 'wok hei' smell and the chilli is especially good
