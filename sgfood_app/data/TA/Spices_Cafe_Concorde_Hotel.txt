Great experience. Good spread of mainly local food. Value for money.
We had a great gathering.
Will come back again
4
Staff are friendly. Wide varieties of food and suitable for my parents. Staff made rojak and served every table. This helped to kick start our eating appetite. Location is also not hard to find.
5
We were pleasantly surprised by the services here! And good variety of food here. Will come Back again!
4
Cozy place with good spread of local cuisine. Friendly staff who were quick to respond to requests. Great place to chill out and chat for long period.
5
This is our this i time here and I must say, I am really happy we came. We came here for lunch . all my friends like the food. staff service good.
4
Great selection of food. Asian and western covered. Great value especially if guest at hotel. Worth a visit.
4
If you have 3 paying adults, you get the 4th adult diner free. For the amount paid and the variety of food, its worth the visit. Not much people on a sunday high tea buffet with local delights.
4
First time visit to this café, very good experience, food variety and taste is good. Service offered is good too. Will recommend friends and next visit.
4
Food is relatively good but having been a frequent customer, the spread are pretty much the same. I do miss the lobster bisque I had the first time I was there
5
This place serves the most fantastic buffet with the focus on quality over variety.Place is decent and the staff service is very prompt. For the price of the buffet I must say it is a place you must try and do come in groups of 4 to take advantage of the 3 +1 promotion by certain credit cards
4
Staff are courteous and obliging. Quick in collecting the used cutlery. One suggestion is to change the menu from time to time so as not to get sick of eating the same old food.
3
I usually stay at the Concorde and occasionally eat in the restaurant.
They have a good evening buffet and a sensible variety of dishes on the menu.
Draft Heineken is available and the service is good.
5
The seafoods and service are awesome! The spread are good, food are kept warm. Seafoods are very freshly serve.
4
Awesome food for a reasonable price. We managed to enjoy discount with card promo. Staff was very friendly & welcoming.
5
Nice environment with good serving of seafood on a ice. Come with compliment half baked cheese lobster too.
4
Was there during New Year’s eve. Food was good and plenty of replishment (never shortage of food) despite the crowds. Good experience overall.
5
Have a great time with my family together with the foods. We love it very much. Suitable for
big groups, staffs friendly. We will come back again.

In an older part of town, Spices cafe is located in Concorde hotel. The building brings back memories of the 70's, and the interior decor is not inspiring either, with a predominantly dark setting. Spices is one of the smaller venues, and only half of the tables were occupied on Friday. One of the perks of a smaller venue is that service was prompt and friendly, and used plates whisked away. The buffet was predominantly seafood orientated, with a-la-carte ordering of crab dishes, and one serving per person of lobster or abalone. The buffet was an international type buffet with cheese, salad, soup, some bread, and a mixture of western and asian-based seafood dishes. There was a small carvery with beef and pork, but when they finished, there wasn't a top up. There was also Japanese sashimi and shellfish. Desserts was a mixture of local nyonya and the eponymous cakes. Coffee and teas were included in the price, and wine was surprisingly affordable (~$9 a glass). We came using a credit card offer (1 free for every 3 diners), and based on that price, it was good value
5
Kudos to the staff, especially the Cashier/Asst Manager. It was a reunion of old friends who went on the AFS exchange programme eons ago We had good food and great reminiscing. Booking was for13 but 12 turned up. One very generous member quietly paid for all and left early...but I found out later that we were charged wrongly as one did not have the buffet. No issue...corrected. However after going home, I realised that the number charged was for 13 not 12. Through one phone call, the Asst Manager corrected it immediately and credited the difference back to my friend's credit card. This was customer service way beyond my expectations! Three cheers for the staff at Spices Cafe
5
I must highlight firstly is it was uncomfortable to have the chefs standing around looking at what food customers take during the buffet dining. Some stand near the table or near the buffet table. No privacy. Felt like being watched. The cheesy lobster is good & fresh but the mushroom sauce lobster is too salty. The salted egg crab is good but the chilli crab gravy is not nice and really need improvement. The Sashimi is fresh.The soup is average. The Eefu noodle is goodRest was good to average. Dessert slightly above average. Coffee is not good, too mild and light, need improve for sure. For this discounted price of abt $47net/pax, it's satisfactory. If the price goes up, we wouldn't go again.
5
The buffet spread was not about quantity but quality. Friendly service crew... the oysters were great... herbal prawns was fresh live prawns cooked..
4
Was here for company year-end dinner! For the price, it is definitely worth a visit. They served nice salad bar, laksa and sashimi! :)
5
Had a great time at spices cafe. If you're into local delight, I'll suggest you give a try. Nice ambience too.
4
Our group of 6 enjoyed the afternoon. Food was reasonably good and gets replenished quickly enough. The teh tarik is better than in previous visits as it’s less sweet.
4
Buffet dinner - harvest of the sea. Unlimited number of crab we can order. Food run out fast and does not replenish as expected
3
Variety of food is limited compared with other buffets. but complemented with crabs in different style and 1 serving of lobster.
4
Newly renovated. Very nice setting and ambience in the cafe. Table abit small though for the 4 of us.
4
Unlimited crab serving, cooked food's nice, satay is nice, restaurant atmosphere looks posh. Service is goos

My husband & I decided to have a buffet dinner to celebrate my birthday last 22nd December. This is our first time to dine at Spice Cafe so we are not really sure if the price could match the quality of the food. The buffet starts at 6:30pm & since we arrived on time, the staff gave us a seat right away.The buffet is 80% seafood, which I like & love the most! There was plenty of variety of seafood to choose, from sooo fresh oysters, salmon susi, crayfish, deep fried baby crabs & more. They do also some sort of meat, like chicken & lamb satay, beef. One staff named Suki came to our table to offer some more dish which are not on the buffet area but it’s a part of the package in dining there. She told us that we can order as much as we can of salted egg crab, black pepper crab, chili crab. And inside the package too is we can have a 2 flavors of looooooooobster!!!! This lobster is sooooo delicious! (Actually I forgot the exact flavor dish of the lobster that we took but it was highly recommended by Suki). Thanks to her. She even told us that since it is my birthday, she will give me cake.All in all, the price of the buffet us very much reasonable, from the quality & quantity of the food, excellent service of the staff, & the relaxing ambience. I highly recommend especially for seafood lover like me!
2
The taste of the crabs and lobster is acceptable but the freshness did not make the cut.The bad:1) Crabs were small and not fresh (meat were soft and watery).2) Lobster meat was sticking to the shell and you can’t even get the whole piece of meat out at one go.3) Limited variety of foodThe good:1) Commendable service from the servers2) LaksaVerdict:Not worth going if you like fresh seafood and wide spread of food for your buffe
4
Went on Mon 27 Nov 2017 with family. Good spread of seafood like oyster shashimi. Service is superb as they clear plates once finish.
5
This is my 1st time dining in Spice Cafe. The food is great n the price is reasonable. Will recommend friends to go there
5
Didn’t expect the ambience to be so good. Food is excellent as well. The service crew are nice and polite
5
To me, this is one of the best buffet restaurants. Been here many times. Worth the money. Food variation is wide and seafood is fresh
4
Had a wonderful Sunday afternoon among good friends and good food. Saw many families celebrating as well as couples having a nice private meal.
4
the spread of food is good - sashimi and signature laksa. The waiter and waitress are helpful. The chef behind each station cook/ prepare food well
4
The staff were prompt in changing the utensils. They were also friendly and efficient. The overall dining experience was pleasant and comfortable. The staff even managed to cordoned off a large group of guests to a secluded room, hence enhancing the dining experience for the rest of diners
4
My friend and I booked online for our gathering and the manager was very nice to put us side by side so we can enjoyed the food and also the gathering. We enjoyed the food and atmosphere very much and everyone was satisfied with the food and fellowship. Glad that I made Spices Cafe as my choice of gathering
4
Plenty delicious selections of breakfasts at reasonable price. Ala carte food is also tasty and place is cozy. I really love this restaurant and the hotel. Out of the hustle bustle of the busy road but yet still in the heart of orchard. I had steak which was perfectly cooked and juicy. And I read other reviewers compliment the seafood menu. I will try it the next time i return to concorde. Would love to recommend this restaurant
5
The crabs are served on order, and can be ordered multiple times as it is a buffet, and I think this place stands out in this sense as you can just order the crab and proceed to the buffet table to get other food, and just wait for crabs that will be brought straight to your table, without queuing or wondering when the crab buffet table is going to be refilled :
5
A very busy restaurant with a great variety of local foods on a buffet and also an a la carte menu.
Busy atmosphere with friendly a very good team. Great value
4
Spread was good, fairly authentic. Dessert was sumptuous, with my favourites being Putu Mayam and durian purée. My parents, brother and sister were there to celebrate our father’s 80th birthday.
5
Great variety of foods and services! Smiley staffs! the raw foods are fresh and good location which easily to reach there by public transport
3
Food spread was good but not really too much to rave about the taste. Only hot beverages and water available.
4
The spread is not much but each of us found something that we liked and enjoyed our lunch gathering. Liked that they bothered to prepare pineapple puree for their satay sauce.
4
The complimentary baked half lobster was fresh. All the service crew were polite and attentive.
I am pretty impressed and will recommend friends to dine at Spices Cafe.
4
Went for lunch with my family at spices cafe. We enjoyed ourselves. We like the variety of choices. As seniors, we can’t eat a lot so the discount given to seniors is a good deal.
4
we went there for breakfast. the offering is not that much compare to other hotel buffet. but they have good coffee, bacon, eggs & bread. i enjoyed the fish ball soup. service was good. they have fresh fruits to complete your meal. we will definitely come bac
5
There was a variety of food offered. Every dish was tasty, delicious, fresh and authentic. Service was excellent. Good atmosphere and ambience. This is my 4th visit and will be back again bringing friends and overseas visitors to taste authentic peranakan food. Price was also reasonable. Well done :)
4
Ambient was good and food were nice. Oyster were really fresh and the herbal prawn are a "MUST TRY".Because it is my daughter's birthday, which I only informed upon my arrival, the restaurant actually presented her a small little "mango" cup cake with a candle. Together with 2 other waitresses, they sang her a birthday son, which was really sweet and nice. Very thoughtful and warm
5
Went on a Saturday, was quite pack. Few toddler was crying but other than that everything was good. 2 Live station serving Prata, laksa, popiah and kway chap! Durian purée was so nice!
4
Good variety of food for buffet. .Staff are attentive. to clear the plates.. The discount for diners 55 years old and above really makes the meal well worth it.😁
5
The spread is awesome and they offer 5 types of crab style and cook upon order. Tasty chilli crab and black pepper crab. Sambal and kung po crab and salted egg crab.. the buffet spread has oysters and sashimi as well.. satays..laksa..drunken prawns ..etc
5
Most of the food are delicious specially the crab! Really value of money and provide a excellent service!
5
Authentic Peranakan buffet with awesome service by In house nonya Rita! My mom loved the durian desert .I loved the pig stomach soup and the Buah Keluak
3
Been there for Weekend Afternoon Tea. The spread never change much, almost the same dishes every time.
5
Range of items very consistent and appetising. though the pepper crabs always a highlight was absent in September. my recent visit.
4
Lovely ambience got sofa seats..fantasy lobster oysters and black pepper crabs. Dessert was good too
3
An impromptu dinner with friends. The free half lobster was fresh but the crabs for the night was disappointing. Not very fresh. The rest of the spread was average.
4
It's been a long while since my last buffet lunch/dinner. Today, my wife and I decided to bring my nephew out for Peranakan buffet lunch at Spices Cafe. My nephew who is handicapped with cerebral palsy since birth knows only one enjoyment - good food. Watching my diet as a personal choice, I was determined to enjoy the meal without any hangover guilt. While helping my nephew to select his food, I made a mental map of what I would take for my own consumption. The spread was reasonably good, around 10 main dishes, soup station, popiah & pie tee station, satay bee hoon & laksa station, fruit rojak, nonya kuehs, desserts, fruits, etc. Zeroing in on only a few main dishes, I also sampled small amounts of soup, laksa, popiah, desserts and fruits. Though I do not have a sweet tooth, I ended up enjoying the green bean sago durian soup and durian pengat most because they use real durian. I was glad I filled my stomach but did not have the bloated feeling of overeating. Choosing wisely what and how much I ate I had conquered the common temptation of over indulgence. There will always be another time to taste the other dishes.
4
I took 2 of my colleagues to Spices Cafe for lunch. We are all seniors. The variety was excellent and we found dishes that we liked and others that we could share just for a taste. The dessert offerings were amazing!
5
I went to Spices Cafe to celebrate my son's birthday. There were a wide variety of food. My son like the sushi n commented they they were fresh.
4
This is my 3rd time to this buffet. I was impressed by the variety of food available. I love the local delight choice and it is so tasty I will recommend my friend to this hotel buffet.
4
Enough varieties for seniors who don't eat a lot. My husband enjoyed it. Good service. I hope more restaurants will give more discounts to seniors who usually don't eat more than they pay for.
5
Went there for dinner with friends. Even though it is a Monday evening, the place was crowded. Lucky we have made reservations. Worth the money. Thanks.
4
Food fresh and well presented. Staff friendly and accommodating. Menu choice varied....selection of local and international cuisine.
4
I told myself. Whenever I am back in town. This is the place to be.One, the executive Chef Sunny works dammed hard to make sure his customers are happily carted for & ate well. Sunny recognised me as a 'sick man' who was unable to eat last month when I decided to keep a lunch date here in order not to disappoint me other friends. So, he told me .... today, you must enjoy to the fullest n please eat more. What a guy.Richard, the manager is always hands on. Always welcoming me with open arms. Because, I am loving the place more as it's like home to me.Nigel, another awesome personnel who goes round the restaurant making the customers are enjoying themselves. To the extent of clearing plates despite having Trainers/other junior staff to do this. What a guy.Rita, always on the ball promoting her best seller. Lemon grass drink that we can't say NO to. Always feels so good whenever she's around.You can see this restaurant caters n services customers to the extreme n reasons why, it's always packed. Today, I was very contended with my laksa. One of the best in town. Satay Bee Hoon was good too. Beef rendang that's so tender n so delicious, satay is always good.Massive spread of beautiful Nonya dishes. Only one dish does not meet its cut. Was the flower crab. Not that it's not nice but the crabs were not fresh at all.Keep up the good work. I will be back in mid October as I return home to Melbourne next week for 2 months of winter wonderland.Thank you for feeding us 4 today, it was as always a delight lunching with Spices served by professional, passionate staff.
5
Being an goldie oldie... I long for the days when visits to restaurants were supposed to be special occassions serving GOOD tasting food in nice environment... unlike the youngsters nowadays who favour lifestyle choice and want exotic taste even for simple coffes and teas....this Restaurant serves EXCELLENT tasting food... variety is not gfreat but eh taste is greta.... THANK YOU SPICE... THANK YOU CHOPE... and I personally complimented the manager on a very well mrun establishment with very very well trained staff... unlike some other restaurants
4
Was there for their weekend dinner buffet. A quiet and great ambience cafe but they seems to be understaffed, need to get them to clear plates and to refill water. They do not have a wide selection of food but serving good quality food and a one time half lobster for every guest, unlimited crab order.Also not to forget the chef @hot station for his good services! Will find a day for their high tea!
4
Location of restaurant is good just inside the Concorde hotel. Food is good at good prices. Variety is also good. However, the service could have been improved to make it better. Water could be refilled by staff without asking for it. But overall would visit agai
4
Mainly local fare such as laksa, satay, popiah, kuay chap, oyster omelette... which mostly are pretty decent. Cakes and pastries are limited though. Service was surprising good too... polite and with personal touch. Overall a good place for family and friends gathering.
4
Friendly staff, good ambience, though the choice of food can improve. The best part of this buffet is their long duration, you can take your own sweet time to eat.
5
Buffet breakfast and seafood buffet are a must do - great range of good quality food. Amazing seafood buffet and great selection of good. Not to be missed.
4
The authenticity of the food made up for the fairly limited variety of dishes. Would have been nice to have a cold sweet drink besides water and hot beverages though.
5
Amazing deal and offer! Under $60, you can whack as much crab as you like! They cook upon order, so I usually order 4 types of crab the moment I get seated, together with the half lobster!
5
Great Value especially for Senior Citizens aged 55 and above. Service Team very friendly and helpful.
5
The only way to start the day, a good breakfast! Vast menus and choices. Local and western flavours and the omelette bar to die for. The best wait staff I encountered in any establishment I have stayed in before. Well done to all the people who make this experience happen
4
It's my first visit at Spice Cafe to celebrate a family member's birthday and it's a Wow for me. Good buffet spread with big fresh oyster, scallop, cold crab leg, sashimi, steam fish, laksa, satay, good western & herbal soup & several others. To my surprise they have local fried egg oyster and it's delicious esp with the must-have chilli. What's next is exciting, every diner is given an ala cart order of lobster(1 side) of your choice and they are served to you hot from the pan. You can also order different types of crabs (chilli, black pepper, salted egg, wine) for as much as you can eat. I used the promo 1 free for every 3 paying. Service staff are nice and attentive. This is so far the best hotel buffet I have came across with good food and value for money. I strongly recommend and I will be back
4
This is my second time dining at the Spices Café, previously went for the Peranakan lunch and just recently for the weekend high tea.Though there were some duplication in the variety of dishes offered, I didn't mind eating the same food again. However, the high tea buffet included the sashimi station which was not present at the Peranakan llunch buffet.All in all, the food was fresh and the quality was good. I have eaten numerous buffets and most of the time, there would be some hits and misses. But at Spices Café, I can say that the quality is very consistent. The variety is more than adequate to fill you up.Definitely a must-go place for buffets where you get good value for money.In addition, the service staff are very friendly and helpful.Keep it up Spices Café !
5
The overall spread was good. Sashimi and oyster was fresh. The lobster with cheese tasted excellent. 6 different crab favors to choose from - I love the salted egg favor. Would definitely go again. The service staff were friendly and very fast in clearing the dirty plates from the table.
4
Spices cafe of hotel Concorde offers a good range of dishes from different cuisines to choose from. Their in-room dining service is also good.
5
Great service big choices for breakfast but terrible coffee ,but people are so nice and helpful that it didn't matter so much
5
Breakfast buffet was wonderful with multiple cuisines to choose from. A la carte menu was excellent as was the buffet
5
Staff were all really helpful throughout our dining experience. Variety was sufficient and we really enjoyed the fresh array of seafood!
3
Food quality need to be improve. Main dish waas the crab, it was not fresh. After having the dinner, most of us have stomach pain.
4
This was my second visit and as usual, the service was excellent. Service crew were friendly & attentive, food was great.
3
The Sri Lanka Chilli crab was soggy. The pig stomach soup was good. There is room for improvement of the buffet.
3
Was there a couple years back and i enjoyed the unlimited ala carte crab dishes. However, was disappointed for my recent visit. While the crabs are still meaty, they are also slightly mushy. Likely the crabs are killed too long. Hot dishes are okay. The herbal prawns are fresh and sweet. Cut fruits are also very sweet. Service was friendly n prompt. Thanks
5
It is a must do buffet for those who want to sample a wide range of authentic local Singapore Chinese / Malay / Peranakan food. The spread includes:# Singapore Chilli Crabs (which one has to pay a bundle in any restaurant), # yummy satay with really good peanut / satay sauce as well as pineapple sauce# Spicy or non-spicy otak# Poh Piah & Kueh Pie Tee# Dim Sum - Har Kow (Prawn Dumplings)# Laksa# DIY Chinese Rojak# Street food Indian putu mayam taken with grated coconut & orange coloured palm sugar# and lots more goodies but the above are my favourites.Food is regularly replenished and the service is good.The restaurant is in Concorde Hotel, which is accessible via MRT, Singapore's subway system.And good value for money for buffet, which unfortunately is only available on weekdays.Wished the buffet is available for the weekends
5
Went with colleagues some time back and brought my mum there today. She loves it! Nonya vege, satay, oyster omelette,laksa, chilli crab, royak, kway chap.. and many more. Their lemon grass drink at additional $1.50 is very good too. They also have discounted price for snr citizen. It was crowded on a friday. Do make reservation.
5
All staff provide excellent service and friendly and the food are value for money. We will go back again.
4
We went there to have a birthday celebration for my daughter.Value for money Seafood buffet. Every one enjoyed the complimentary cheese lobster.
5
Our group of 4 people enjoyed an outstanding seafood buffet in the Spices cafe
Oysters,prawns,crab,mussels,lobster plus all other meals buy 2 measl pay for 1
Excellent staff very friendly Ross-Sita managed the restaurant magnificently
4
Nice & sumptous buffet spread. Good service. Was there to celebrate my hubby birthday. A nice complimentary piece of cake was presented to us for the celebration. Thanks to the café for such a memorable day.
5
The food was amazing and the staff so helpfull.
if the manger see this please do something about the beep beep beep of the omelette maker,,,, it drived me crazy,, beep beep beep
4
Good Value for money for quality food. If possible they should serve perankan fare for weekend also. Love their spread
5
There is one complimentary lobster per person. Unlimted supply of crab which the server brings to me every now and then. The buffet dishes on the table are all delicious. My favorite dishes are the raw oyster and japan long crab legs.
5
Fantastic Food and Exceptional Service from the crew. Very fast to change the plates on your table and a wide variety of foods to choose from. Great service from Mr Aravin.
4
the spread for an afternoon high tea considered not bad. My twin niece and nephews love their satay, kueh pai tee, prata and ice cream. for the adults, we love it all esp laksa and the chinese cuisines. Overall experience is good, price could be cheaper esp come in a big group
5
The restaurant is highly recommended for family looking for a weekend lunch or couple looking for weekend casual date. The staff is friendly and will tend to chat with you to see if everything is fine. Overall, the restaurant never fail to disappoint (being here for 4 times)
3
The spread is good but the quality is average. It is still worth a visit for the seafood lovers. Value for your $$$ overall.
3
The cafe was packed considering it was a week day, Probably due to ongoing promotion.
Food is acceptable.
4
An excellent seafood buffet was offered here. It was great value for the price with a wide range of seafood on offer.
3
There were some hit and misses. Lobster mentaiko, salted egg crab and herbal prawns were good. Everything else was pretty average.
5
Great meal, very cost effective compared to buffet in Australia, excellent wide range selection with plenty of fresh seafood.
5
Overall food was normal could have gotten better selection and variety. I expected more from the price that I was gonna pay but nevertheless staff service is superb
4
The selection was truly good and
There was something for every fussy person . The service girls were truly friendly and welcoming . They were efficient and polite with ready smiles . A v enjoyable experience
5
I was there with my wife and Parents and we enjoyed the buffet very much. The sashimi is fresh and was refilled frequently, same for the rest of the food at the buffet. The Indian chef at the prata counter cooked the prate to perfection. There were satay, otak, durian pengant, laksa, kway chap and many more. And, the best of the best is the long hour which makes it a great place to enjoy a great meal with family and friends. Good job, Spices Cafe! :
2
Have previously enjoyed the Peranakan lunch buffet. Food at those occasions was good. This time round it was disappointing. Flavours of most of the hot dishes were diluted compared to before. I appreciate it is a buffet, but items in the chafing dishes felt like they had been left out too long - mostly dry and tough. Even the desserts. Service was not as confident as before.
4
The Peranakan spread was great value at $26++ for Senior Citizens and with music and entertainment too (every 2nd and 4th Monday only)! The live band with a singer belted out oldies which kept the Seniors in happy spirits. The "ter-thor tng" was well done but by the time we got to it - at 12:30pm - there was hardly any ingredients left in the pot. We loved the do-it-yourself rojak counter as the range of fruits and veggies was wide and the hei-koh was thick and gluey, not diluted like most places. Also worth mentioning was the laksa and the popiah. Finger bowls were placed at all tables for the chili crab which was a thoughtful gesture by the management. Save space for dessert especially the durian and banana pengats and kueh-kueh. We will definitely be back
4
Daily lunch buffet spread could be a little more interesting with a wider choice of food, even if it has to be on a rotational basis (weekly?).
4
I appreciate Mr Richard from Spices Cafe for his great help for a small problem created by one of the waitress(RITA-Malay Auntie). I would not have enjoyed my lunch buffet on 25th Feb if he did not lend a helping hand. Thanks Richard.
4
very good service been there 2 times, Christmas and valentines day. food good but service by staff very good
3
We went for CNY reunion with family. Food was not good. Ordered crabs inclusive of buffet were of poor quality. Cold and small. Oysters were not fresh. Overall a disappointment. Service was ok though. Ambience was not bad.
4
The location and variety of menu proved that this restaurant is having all the qualities to prove its capability in course if time.
I found its food very tasty with wide variety.
5
Great dinner . Great atmosphere great people. Good service attitude with pleasant smiles. Food was done well and fresh . With the price, it's worth to come back when you had a Long day and feeling hungry .
4
Love Harvest of the Sea buffet. Food is awesome as well as a good spread of food varieties. Will definitely visit again.
3
The service staffs were good in keeping the plates on the table but very often they will put other fork and spoon onto other people area. From start till end, our glasses of water were not filled even when it is empty. All the crabs served were not fresh and it tasted bad. Ready cooked food were good.
4
We had dinner at this restaurant a few nights ago and it was enjoyable. The staff were friendly and the food was reasonably good. I had the nasi goreng but there was not a lot in the fried rice but the chicken satay was delicious. My husband had a chicken leg fillet which he enjoyed.John & Gail Lane
5
The staff are friendly and approachable. They have initiatives in checking if everything is fine at specific intervals. The food selection may be limited but not to the extent of being too little. This place is highly recommended for family, friends, and couples looking for a casual and comfortable dining experience
4
This is my 3rd visit. Each and eveytime the foos and staff never fail us. Will always come back again.
5
It was a delight to have found out about this buffet. We will go again next time we are in Singapore
4
If chef not aloned. Service will be better. Serving Chef and staff are friendly esp local staff.. spread is various
4
Very good pernakan lunch. Good food and service. But they hv slow down or even replenish their food 30mins before the lunch close.
4
The food was wonderful, variety excellent n service was attentive and good. Excellent place for gathering of friends n family.
5
Staff were very polite and attentive.
Thou roughly enjoyed the experience. Definitely recommend and will also revisit the cafe.
3
Went there for Friday buffet dinner with a few colleagues. Their advantage is the good location and competitive price
4
I stay at The Concorde Hotel frequently, I seldom have breakfast as it isn't very good but occasionally I have supper even though the Spices restaurant, like the remainder of the hotel, is very old fashioned.However, last night I had a most enjoyable supper, chicken tikka masala with rice and Nan bread, a pint of draft Carlsberg and an exceptional dessert, berries and ice cream.Excellent service also
4
Visited this restaurant with 8 other friends for dinner. Have heard much good review on the seafood, oysters, crab and sashimi. The Oysters are fresh and large, really delicious. The crabs which need to be order a la carte, about 30 mins waiting time, are rather disappointing as they are not up to expectation in terms of taste and size. The herbal prawn soup is so much better as the prawns are scoop fresh from the tank and cooked in front of you. The dessert has a good selection as well
5
A truly enjoyable experience. The food was excellent, providing a wide selection that ensured no one was left out from finding something they enjoyed. The wait staff was always available to provide excellent service and the table hostess (Rita) was simply wonderful, engaging us through out the meal. So good that we will be making another visit very soon (Reservations locked in)
5
Excellent service and food is pretty good. Thumbs up to the attentive and friendly staffs. Good job keep it up.
5
Enjoyed the seafood buffet. Great taste. Limited drinks option, only coffee and tea. No soda or fruit juice.
4
Great ambience. Food was normal but the unlimited crab was a plus. It comes with a choice of lobster / abalone per person. The cheese lobster was awesome.
4
We had our Saturday afternoon tea there and many food choices to try. Kids friendly environment too, staff was very helpful too.
3
It is really self-service buffet with nobody serve you unless you call them and sometimes they even MIA. Come on, if this is full house and you are busy then i can understand, but the fact is, there is only a few table they need to take care. I just want a warn water also need to ask. The online promotion mention i can have abalone and lobster when i order a table online, but in the end they told me not using the website, should be send email to order. It really stupid and i feel disappointed but i just don't want to argue with them

I like the buffet because of the quiet ambiance and they actually offer you the choice of lobster with cheese / sambal sauce ( limit to 1 person). Enjoyed the salted egg crab , and food spread have more variety of chinese, asian food e.g. mutton satay, sea bass, scallop.
2
The quantity cold dishes like cooked prawns & sushi were miserable. Fried noodles very very oily; pork & chicken satays seemed not fully cooked; popiah skin too hard; laksa counter always lack of noodles; ice-cream in 1 stick form (like potong ice-cream) though restaurant was packed but no adult will want to hold & lick to eat the ice-cream in the public. I will not come back for this buffet but rather go to Fullerton hotel as it is having the same price & promotion for the weekend tea buffet

I hv been visiting since 2012 and every dinning experience has been wonderful. I love their peranakan spread of Laksa, buah keluak,babi Pontah. ,poplars and kueh piatee . Dessert includes coconut ice cream, chendol,durian mousse, all kinds of peranakan kueh...just endless.The lunch time weekend buffet has a special price for seniors so I love bringing my elderly sister there. Great..will continue to recommend this cafe..great value for money and good hearty meal..very home- cooked.

It was a gathering of old classmates. First we thought the music was too loud compared with my previous visits. Then we found out that there was a live performance- a lady singing oldies but goodies! Many clapped and sang along as a lot of the audience were senior citizens. Apparently this happens on Mondays. The food, as usual, was good. Lots of variety, My friends loved the durian dessert and the Kuey Pie Tee, Popiah, Chilli crab, Laksa, etc. With our senior citizen discounts, it was really good value for mone

Went on a weekday night so not crowded. Seafood dishes were plentiful. There were crab dishes, lobster bisque, herbal prawns, choice of lobster or abalone. All very fresh and tasty. Plates were cleared very fast so it was very pleasant to eat here. One thing was the head chef was standing around when we first went in and my mum was asking him whether there was any soup for the kids. The way he answered was pretty hostile. But the other service staff was very very good. Will definately come back
2
Spread was alright. However staff was slow in clearing used plates.
Several times, we had to pass our plates to the servers standing around.
2
I won't recommend this place to my friends. The food quality leaves much to desire, though it's an eat all you can lunch buffet.
4
Seafood more choice with alasca crab, salmon sashimi,scallop,fresh oyster, and more choices of crab flavor to choose from their ulimited order. Other than seafood has limited non seafood to choose. Overall is great for seafood lover.
4
Popiah, satay and kuehs are nice. Lovely and attentive staff. More variety of nyonya dishes will be great
4
The seafood buffet was very good. Seafood were fresh and the oysters were really big and juicy. Like the fact that they serve crab ala carte way, where you place order for the different types of crab to be cooked and they serve in small portion which allows tasting of the various varieties. The staff were attentive and helpful. Overall, had an enjoyable dinner
5
The restaurant is cosy and welcoming. The spread doesn't seem much but provides a wide array of choices. The lobster was delicious, and the crabs were made to perfection. Service was excellent and for its price, Spices Cafe is hard to beat.If you're looking for a place to sit back and enjoy a buffet meal with your loved ones, Spices Cafe is the place to be

We won complimentary dinner for 2 at Spices Cafe. Knowing that it is not halal, we tried to sell it to other people. However, none wish to buy, thus we give it a try as we also celebrating our second year of anniversary. We would like to say a million thank you to SUKI who convince us which and which area is Halal & not Halal areas, who never stop serve us from the moment we enter the restaurants till we left from the places, who never stop ask us to eat as much as we can to enjoy the dinner together. She made us feels very confidence and feels like we are the VIP eventhough none of them knows that we are celebrating our anniversary. By doing this, we made our dinner night more happier and wonderful. Food was nice especially the Lobster and Black Pepper Crab was superb fantastic, thank you so much for Arvin which the one who offer us with good suggestion as well. Location is easy and very convenience. Well done to all the staffs for the great customer service
5
We were greeted warmly and shown to our tables, the staff went out of their way to make sure we had our drink order before showing us to the lunch buffet. The buffet selection was fairly extensive and we indulged in many mouth-watering Nonya dishes which we haven’t had in a long time - popiah made fresh, chili crab, Ayam Keluak, laksa etc. etc. The different kuehs, cendol and ice kachang was part of an extensive dessert selection. There was a lot more I didn’t get around to trying. Great ambience, modern and clean. The price was reasonable at $35 for adults and $25 for seniors
4
Great buffet eaterie with an enormous selection of peranakan ( nyonya) food! Clientele mainly peranakan retirees in their traditional 'kebayas' but there were the othe locals as well. You will be spoilt for choice....and even a glutton would have to pace His/her appetite so as to avoid indigestion! The downside is : lack of cutlery, whether teaspoons or tablespoons . What a shame for it shows that the kitchen is unable to keep up with demands!Next the empty food containers ....a couple of popular dishes were gone quickly and We had no idea when they would be replenished. we did bring to the waiter's attention but among everything else when the place got busy ..... Requests etc got easily forgotten. Maybe try a lunchtime day when it 's less busy
5
Booked thru Chope for my husband birthday dinner @ Spices. When we reached, we are greeted by friendly and "smiley" door staff. After which we are seated by another staff which explained the spread & special dishes that they are offering. Overall, good experience which we will definitely introduced to our friends & relatives
5
Dined in Spices at Concorde Hotel, Singapore with a colleague
Lovely warm welcome
Offered Buffet or A la Carte menus
Chose the buffet which had a great selection and was very good quality
Team very friendly and efficient.
Definitely will return.
5
The food is very fresh and the service was very professional and fast. The atmosphere is also very comfortable too.
4
Went there couple of times and each time the service is consistently superb. Nice food and great value for money.
4
Service was really great! The waitress greet us with warm smiles and greetings. Plates were cleared very fast as well. The food choices is a little bit limited but the crabs were awesome especially chilli crab! Worth a visit!
5
Had lunch with my friends on Tuesday. Love the local Peranakan cuisine. Wide spread of everything you can think of that is Peranakan. The best is the durian penyak! Must try. Will return to visit if I'm craving for Peranakan food again.
4
Went there on a weekday night for cousin's birthday celebration, food spread was not bad but service was really good. Attentive servers and very polite. Thumbs up!
4
Not my first time back to have feast occasion with friends. This time is a birthday celebration. Oysters deshell not as clean. Always have dirt of the shell within the oyster.
4
Imagine a buffet session stretching from 12noon to 4.30pm at a hotel coffee house on weekends! What's more, the food spread is fantastic with many local favorites like bak kut teh, prata, or chien (ho luak), kway chap and many more. Enjoy!
5
Of the 5 different crab dishes, three were good. Two have too much sticky sauce. All the crabs are generally fresh and meaty.
4
Taste good, reasonable variety, attentive staff, and clean environment (including the toilet!).I love their nasi kunyit (turmeric rice) as it is soft and fragrant. I also enjoyed their desserts even though some of it can be a bit too hard.The spread includes main courses like ayam buah keluak (chicken), ikan asam (fish),lamb and babi ponteh (pork). They have laksa (curry with coconut milk + rice noodles), Poh piah (vegetables roll) and kuih pie tee too! They have discount for senior citizen (age 55 and above) on monday, it costs SGD25.50++ onl
4
All different kind of continental breakfast. Very good service from the staff, who was very friendly.
5
food is great...i love the fresh oysters... the staffs are all friendly...they always check our tables if we need something.
5
The food is wonderful and the Harvest of the sea buffet dinner was fantastic the choice of chilli crab was great the staff were attentive and very pleasant.
4
I has dinner here. Nothing special and it's quite expensive in comparision between the price and quality.
5
The harvest of the sea buffet dinner, is absolutely amazing. Do not be put off if like me you do not eat alot off sea food. There is also a exellent surply of other dishes.
Suki was wonderful, could not have been more helpful.
4
Too tired to go out, we shuffled down to the lobby of our hotel and dined at Spices seafood buffet. Food was very good, fresh and nicely displayed. The meal also includes lobster, crab or other choices made fresh in the kitchen and brought to your table. While I made a mess eating the Chili Crab, it was delicious! Guests of the hotel receive an additional discount. Dinner was our only meal there, but two thumbs up for the seafood buffet
4
Went as a party of 2 for their afternoon high tea buffet. Food variety was splendid, some of them (like the kway chup) were rarely seen at buffets. The Lady and I thought the best dish among all was their oyster omelet. Personally felt that the place looked classy. Overall a place that you might want to take a look while in the area.
5
A restaurant or food outlet is for travelers and foodies to unwind,relax and most importantly fill our tummy. I think the staffs are have a direct influence in our dining moods and and also bring joy and fulfillment to diners. As a far and wide regular traveler, the staffs at Spices Cafe outshone others in the food and beverage industry. They are attentive, full of initiative and smiley when serving all the guests. From my experience as a regular client, I observe that most of their guests are return customers. This speak volumes of their service. Food selection is wide and well prepared. Worth your visit while in Singapore.
4
This is the main restaurant within Concorde Hotel It serves a delicious buffet of various cuisines and something different in the menu daily so it rotates and doesn't get boringI'm very comfortable eating alone hereThe staff are friendly and prompt in looking after you Great customer service
4
Been to spices cafe.. Is a great place for meeting friends.. Like the deco of the place but it was a bit noisy for afternoon tea buffet.. Everyone was talking loudly. Food was ok.. Would prefer to ️Hv more varieties of dessert.. Overall it was quite good for all my visits there
5
You cannot ask for nicer service. It starts with Rita greeting you. Our kids adore her and give her a hug every morning. Suki then helps watch over you while eating your meal. I must also mention Richard, Daisy, Victoria, Kong, Sonny, and the rest of the group that make us feel so welcome
4
We enjoyed the food - fresh oysters, lobsters( would recommend the cheese lobster as the other option, chilli belacan lobster was a letdown), crabs( would recommend the salted egg crab), hot cheese souffle and chocolate sauce.They didn't really have a lot of choices but the food was mostly good and so we were more than happy to go for seconds. The service was okay and it's a great place to bring friends and colleagues. So if you're looking for a quiet,romantic dinner, best to go somewhere else
5
The Spices Café is a large, well-established restaurant within the Concorde Hotel. Throughout the day they serve a wide selection of Asian and Western dishes, snacks and drinks. On week days their Harvest of the Sea buffet dinner with lobster and delectable crab dishes is especially popular. It’s an excellent place to take guests.When we stay at the Concorde, we always have breakfast at Spices Café because of its wide array of choices. Whether we prefer beginning our day with American, Continental, Indian or Japanese cuisine, we are never disappointed. We always wind up taking a bit of everything because it’s all so delicious! One of the very best features of Spices Café is its friendly service-oriented staff. We are always greeted by name and given the warmest of welcomes whenever we walk through the door. They are also especially attentive to those who have come to Singapore for medical reasons and have special needs. The servers at Spices always succeed in making our dining experience there the highlight of our day. We highly recommend Spices Café for anyone in the vicinity. It’s conveniently located near the Somerset MRT station, Istana, OG department store and Centerpoint. Do give it a try if you are in the area
5
Find this place by accident when browsing tripadvisor. Their location is great, not far from MRT station, very near Istana and Orchard Rd 's mall so that you can enjoy your meal after watching Changing the Guards @ Istana or go shopping after the meal. Their seafood buffet is unlimited and great especially crab dishes. Their sashimi sushi dishes are great too although the choice of fish was limited, which help me save my stomach for delicious crab dishes. The staff were very nice and fast. They still gave me discount for seniors in my group although we weren't Singaporean or their hotel guests
4
We stayed in the hotel and were offered a 2 for 1 style meal where it cost $58 for the 2 of us - EXCELLENT value with this offer. Food was mainly great and while staff smiled a lot, sometimes I found the service in this restaurant lacking a little. We also had another meal in here, where we ordered straight from the menu - It was OK but again, service was lacking.
4
Went to Spices for my birthday (4 Adults, 2 Children) had seafood buffet, was great. All enjoyed and the deal through the hotel made the cost even better. The lobster cooked fresh was done to your taste, all seafood was beautifully presented, We all would recommend
5
We have used Spices frequently while staying at Concorde. Our breakfasts have been excellent every day .. We could not fault the staff.. So happy and friendly. Dinner at night was very good and we thoroughly enjoyed the Harvest from the Sea dinner. The food selection throughout our stay has been enormous. Absolutely to our requirements 
5
Recently tried this with my pal and the overall experience was higher than I expected. The waiters and waitresses served us well throughout our meal. Furthermore, the spread of food was sufficient. The free flow of crabs comes in a hot plate upon ordering. It is extremely delicious with appropriate sizes. In addition, major credit cards also grant a 10% of total bill. The only set back is the drinks choices are really limited
5
Concorde Hotel is a place we feel at home when in Singapore. Having breakfast or a meal at Spiced Cafe is a heartwarming experience. All the staff there make you feel as if you are at home or at a long tine friend's place. Service is attentive and sincere. Best of all, the staffs are able to remember regular guests' name and their food preference. An outstanding staff I wish to mention is Mr. Arvin. Always smiling, friendly and sincere. Last but not least, my appreciation goes to all the people in Concorde Hotel that put term a cut above most Five stars hotel in Singapore despite some shortcomings on infrastructure, facilities and food. Congratulations.

Went to source around a week before the dinner and notice this restaurant with less than half occupancy. Decided to book a table on Mothers' Day week thought that it is going to be a peaceful & enjoyable dinner. However, on the day of arrival, it was pretty crowded and noisy with added tables in the restaurant. In fact the choice of food are very limited and long Q for the herbal prawn soup and laksa as only one pathetic servicing staff. I did not try out the crab as it looks very dry the way they cook. Overall food just average with limited choice
5
value for money. good service. tasty dishes and dishes that are hard to find in Singapore. lemongrass drink is worth paying for. it gives senior citizen discount too.
4
The food here I must say is delicious. Lunch time they serve peranakan food. O so yummy. Lots of old folks who come here during lunch. So the atmosphere is a lively one during lunch.
4
Very good seafood buffet at reasonable price. Many varieties n one is spoilt for choice. The staffs are friendly n helpful.
4
I was a guest of a friend there... the food was good and the spread was fantastic. Service was fabulous Its quiet place and good atmosphere.
Special mention for the staff Derby who served me. Thank you
5
Very surprised to see some negative reviews. Had one single dinner abd there was a ton of choice with excellent seafood. Great cheese selection (unlike the breakfast that was rather pitiful).
Highly recommended in my mind!
5
If you haven't been to the ocean, Spices Cafe is one that you would love to go for. Certainly not because it's located anywhere ocean, but the food comes fresh from it. I stepped into the restaurant with my girlfriend and was well greeted by the staffs on smiles. The ambience of it is rather cosy and relaxed, partly of the dim lights walking in. Once seated down on leather like sofa stretch, we felt that this is a really nice environment to dine in. The highlights of the dinner buffet and what makes it uniquely different from others;– one complimentary serving of baked half lobster (200gms) gratinated with cheese– one complimentary serving of braised baby abalone with broccoli and mushroom– Cooked-to-order crabs, which comes in a range of appealing flavours- Chilli, Black Pepper, Sauteed Saffron, Butter & White Pepper and Salted EggSeafood are served to you at your dining table, and comes piping hot. Salted egg yolk and butter crabs are two of our favourites, so do try out all and decide which is your preferred flavours. The tastes are distinctly better than what most crabs are served outside. Spices serve some really good Peranakan dishes, which is quite uncommon to find in most International buffets I would say. Definitely the laksa worth your tastebud. Desserts comes in a range of variety from premium ice creams and flavours, and local desserts and cakes as well. If you visit the ice cream corner often enough, you will realise that the restaurant tends to change the flavours once it finished. So you may have seen 4 flavours at the beginning, but may lie a chance that you will see a many other flavours at the end of dinner. So definitely worth a visit, with friends and family, tourists who wants to enjoy some blend of local tastes. Promotions ongoing in the month of April will One dine for free with every 3 paying adults at Concorde Hotel’s Singapore Flavours Buffet Lunch, Harvest of the Sea Dinner Buffet and weekend Afternoon Tea Buffet. Watch out for such great perks from the hotel and remember to call to make reservations in order not to disappoint

This is a very popular restaurant for Nonya/Peranakan food. The first time we tried to make some reservations, it was fully booked. This time we made reservations two weeks in advance. Five of us went there for a birthday celebration. When we arrived there for lunch, the place was quickly filled up. We were not disappointed. The main attraction was the Peranakan food. They have a very good spread plus a number of Singaporean dishes. Our best votes go to the fruits rojak, babi (pork) buah keluak, beef rendang, popiah and pie tee, laksa, chilli crabs. They have a very good selection of nonya desserts served in bit-sizes, fruits, ice cream, with coffee and tea.Highly recommended
2
Booked for dinner. Which we thought was a good idea.When we arrived were were offered either crab or Lobster, which we thought was a tad odd, but it turned out it was ONLY seafood that night, and seemingly the next night and the next night.Seafood is good but please let people know when they book what the menu consists of and that you can ONLY get seafood.From other reviews, it must do other food, but not this week
5
First visited this restaurant 3 years ago ! Nothing has changed still a very welcoming place with great ambience and exceptional staff. The breakfast buffet is very varied with a range of cuisines catered for. Good coffee aswell ! The Perakanan lunch buffet is excellent and always full of locals which in itself is a great recommendation. But the main attraction has to be the Harvest of the Seas evening buffet. Wow ! Great value price includes choice of crab and half a lobster per person along with an amazing array of seafood from the buffet. A must go if you are in the Orchard Road area
2
As the name implies, SPICES CAFE located on the third level of Concorde Hotel, serves mainly PERANAKAN (Straits Chinese) food. The spread is acceptable; but some of the QUALITY of the food is well below par. Most of the prawns even cooked with the spices are just rotten, despite the spices!!! MANY of the dishes are also poor in both the preparation and quality. The BEEF in the RENDANG BEEF is also half cooked, one can still see the blood in the beef when cut, and the beef also tasted rotten!!! The Chilli Crab despite the strong chilli used, the crab also taste rotting. Some of the FOOD COURTS in Singapore serves much better quality food than HERE !!! Wonder if their F&D Management is aware of this; and the Ministry of Health!!! Try it, if you have a strong stomach!!
3
The buffet is below average. The seating arrangement is congested. Only limited food menu is offered.
5
Seafood dinner at Spices the highlight of recent trip to Singapore. Fantastic fresh and well prepared with great service
5
One of the best buffet's in Singapore - The seafood selection was fresh and amazing.
The staff were very helpful and the unlimited crab was a lovely bonus
5
Wonderful friendly service plus a good selection of breakfast foods inc. cereals,omelettes,fresh fruit, yoghurt, toast, bacon, eggs tea and coffee. The staff are amazing, always smiling and friendly particular mention must be made of Rita who, with her smiling charm is a great start to the day
3
The food isn't that bad however, the dining experience can be ruined by a certain kind of crowd dining there at the lunch buffet.Be prepared to be jostled/nudged/pushed out of the way and have someone cut in front of you while you're queueing for the food
4
The cafe has a good layout and lovely decor. The buffet spread for lunch was quite good and most of the dishes were of an good standard. It was a plus that they served finger food sizes for some of the items like "Apom Berkuah" and other Nonya kueh (Peranakan cakes) as this meant we could try more varieties. There were sufficient interactive stations eg for Poh Piah, kueh pie tee, rojak, laksa and ice kacang. All in a, it's good value for $$. Most important of all, the service was excellent with one of the staff even breaking spontaneously and sportingly into songs upon request, even dancing to it. So it was a very memorable experience for us
5
What a great selection of seafood at " the harvest of the sea " buffet. The oysters are BIG - loved the1/2 lobster & the crab.Many choices to choose for hot food & the desserts are mouth watering. Service is exceptional , & the price is right
3
Ambience is nice. Good legroom in between chair and table is quite spacious. We were invited by our boss to celebrate our annual meet-up. There's ample space to move around. The food variety is enough. Poor selection of cheese. Not many varieties of vegetable. Good variety of desserts though. The mango pudding is nice. The grass jelly pudding is a bit bitter. The cakes are too sweet where you cannot distinguish anything but the sugary taste. The pistachio mousse is one of the nicest dessert there. I find that the salted prawn very good but the selection for the cold dish is just ok. Oyster is fresh but the crab is a bit bland. Mushroom soup taste too milky. Laksa is good. For dinner, each individual can either choose half pc of lobster cooked with sambal (chilli) or cheese. Either that, they can also choose abalone. So all of us opted for the lobster but the cheesy one taste very creamy. The meat is tender and nice. Of all, I would recommend the cheesy lobster. We can choose varieties of cooked crab. One of them is saffron crab but the taste is not that fantastic. The crab cooked with cheese is nicer. There's crab cooked in sweet and sour or the sambal one as well. They do have a good varieties of tea selection
5
We only had breakfast here but boy was it good. A mix of Asian and Western you can find just about anything you could possibly want for breakfast. Lots of Japanese delicacies, some with Korean and Chinese influence and then eggs any way you want them along with all the traditional western meats, potatoes and fixings you are accustomed to having. All served in a pleasant atmosphere by a professional staff who attends to your needs but does not rush or push you along
4
Always into Peranakan cuisine. This hotelwas ex le meridian. A first time for me & I was taken aback by the massive offerings.We kick start with the popiah, the fruits rojak. The laksa even comes with sea clams, there's also congee, there's also pig stomach soup.The main events were unbelievable. You have Chilli king crabs, king prawns, beef rendang, chap Chye, Ayam buakelak was good too.Desserts were a gem. Lots Nonya kueh kueh & even chendol n coffee was complimentary.An added plus. Senior citizen takes $10 off their $35 price per head. With the massive delicious food. It's a bargain .Restaurant manager, Richard was a friendly, very polite n make every customers feel at home.Keep it up guys. You are simply awesome, good food, good service too n simply good food wise, simply the best in town.
5
Loved the baked half lobster gratinated with cheese. Worth the price. Excellent service. Various foods til you don't know what to eat.
5
We ate way too much food for breakfast so much choice and very nice. Dinner at spices we had the Buffett lots of choice and great food. Staff provided warm and friendly hospitality. Just great highly recommend.
4
Had daily buffet breakfast and a la carte lunch once. More than satisfied with food and especially the Indian options.
5
Be sure to make a reservation. Outstanding satay, oyster omlette, buah keluak, poh piah, kueh pi-ti, way chap, yong tahu, some dim sum, desserts were authentic; chendol, ice-kachang etc...
4
Had breakfast here for a week, there was plenty of variety.Egg station, hot and cold foods, a nice Indian, Japanese and Chinese selections. Coffee machines which were better than filter coffee. Would be nice if all the pastries were warmed, not just the croissants.
5
We always a pleasant greeting from Rita or her staff on arrival, promptly shown to a seat. Service and food was good. Prices are reasonable.
4
Spices Cafe offers a daily Peranakan buffet lunch very reasonably priced at $25.50++ for Senior citizens. Being a Peranakan, I must say I rarely eat at Peranakan restaurants but I was meeting friends for lunch and since we are all Seniors, we thought we would try their buffet. There was a very wide selection including some hawker food and although I wouldn't say that every dish was superb, overall it was a value-for-money meal and I would certainly go there again
5
Went for a traditional peranakan buffet lunch. Was delighted with the choices and the quality of food. Could not try all the food available as there was just too much! A must try is the Sri Lankan crab dish. There is a large dessert section as well so leave a little room for that!
3
If you are a tourist and you wish to try an assortment of local and Japanese food, this is the place. Not heavily priced but decent, 3 of us was SG$168. It has sushi, Asian and local food. The oysters are very fresh and creamy. And service is very good.
5
The breakfasts at Spices are very good but we were gobsmacked by the goodness of the seafood buffet! Many different styles of fish and shellfish were offered including your choice of crab-chili, fried soft shell, garlic or lobster and more are included with the price pf the buffet. Anne our hostess was extremely helpful in explaining the processes of how to eat the many different styles of crab and lobster. She and the rest of the staff are very pleasant. It was a very popular place with the locals as well: there were many tables of people having their corporate Christmas parties. There are also selections for vegetarians and meat eaters, but why bother when you have such a large selection of seafood to choose from? It is expensive compared to most dining in Singapore, but definitely worth it especially since we had a one for one coupon. Do go
5
We found the service by the staff very attentive. The array of various food selections would please all visitors.
4
They have superb local Nonya food with various choices till local dessert. Value for money and very friendly staff who nicely dress in traditional Nonya costume.
5
Thanks to Mrs.Rita and Mrs.Suki for calm atmosphere and exelent service in Spice Cafe. A loooot of good food , quick and cheerfull people, nice place and very reasonable.
3
Nice buffet selections but nothing out of the ordinary, except maybe for the crabs/lobster. Service is a bit lackluster, I had to follow up with the waitress twice before the lobster which I ordered was served.
5
Best food, pretty cool ambience and the service was superb. We enjoyed our meals to the maximum since we found some thing close to home made cuisines away from home.
4
Was there with a group of ex-colleagues to celebrate our birthday on 30 Aug.
The service staff were very attentive to our needs.
The popiah and durian pengats were good.
4
All you need for Breakfast. Good choice of Asian and Western Food.Service Staff is very friendly , fast and oragnized.
5
What a great place to eat, every morning when I came down for breakfast I was greeted with a smile from Rita or another lovely person, shown to a table and had a great breakfast. There is so much to choose from and they don't hurry you when it's very busy. Can't wait to eat here again when I'm next in Singapore, one of the best hotels I've stayed in
3
Caught up with our Golden Girls group for a reunion after 4 years for a buffet lunch. As 2 of the 4 members in the group live in UK and Australia, we always opt for local cuisine buffet. I couldn't believe the large variety of local nonya and hawker food presented at this buffet which included chilli crab, satay, ortak, popiah; not to mention the variety of nonya dessert available. The everyday lunch special for Seniors of $24 is unbelievable. The staff was attentive and constantly replaced our plates for fresh ones which enable us to truly savour the different dishes. Don't miss this place if you want to taste the authentic local cuisine in a comfortable environment
5
my fav place in singapore,everytime i visit singapore,its a must to have lunch here,or buffet or hi-tea buffet.so many things to choose at the buffet table,western foods and asian.friendly staffs and good service..kak rahima and kak wei is the best there...thank u kak...see u soo
4
Fabulous variety for breakfast: Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Western. I loved the congee and condiments. My friends enjoyed the dhal. Healthy choices too!
5
food and staff excellent,buffet breakfast catered for all.Seafood buffet was excellent,Lobster Oysters,etc.
4
The staff is very helpful as my son required special diet arrangement. They will arrange to check the detail such as the oil type and their cooking method.
5
I liked variety and quality of breakfast, dinner, lovely atmosphere, friendly attitude of hosts, in short a great service
4
Very good breakfast with plenty of variety. Staff were ready to help and were courteous and polite. The restaurant was very clean and the presentation of the food was excellent.
5
Restaurant quality food. Wide variety of choices from Japanese sushi, sashimi, fresh oysters, alaskan crabs, satay, laksa, scallops, fresh steamed fish, lobsters, abalone, chilli of black pepper crabs and the long list goes on. Kitchen staffs were always one step ahead of the hungry diners keeping all trays and selection fully stocked at all times. Services staffs were attentive and though extremely busy, still managed to flash that constant smile. This place automatically goes into my top 5 hotel buffet list
5
My friends and I had the best time at Spices Cafe! We went specifically to experience the Peranakan cuisine which is a buffet lunch available Monday to Friday from 12 noon to 2:30pm.Very reasonably priced and you can return to the buffet as often as you wish. Management and wait staff were all attentive and friendly. One particular waitress really stood out ... Rita you were excellent
5
Tried this restaurant as they serve authentic Peranakan dishes at the cafe's Singapore flavours buffet lunch. The food was great quality and being a buffet you can try all sorts of dishes. Went at lunchtime. Had not booked but this was not an issue the staff found us a table and provided excellent service from start to finish. They have black peppered crab, popiah, various keuh. I can recommend trying it.
4
After visiting the Istana on Sunday, it started to rain & we rushed into the Concorde Hotel looking for shelter & perhaps some lunch.We were directed to Spices Cafe by staff at the lobby.The food spread for the Nonya Tea Buffet was ok... But what impressed us was the friendliness & warmth from the staff.Everyone were friendly & constantly tried to make us feel comfortable
2
Although this place is rated very high by non vegetarians and sea-food lovers but trust me this is a pathetic place for vegetarians. They serve same food everyday in their buffet breakfast with just 2 things i.e. Idli and parata with curry. I mean who would like to have a spicy and full of turmeric curry everyday and that too right in the morning. In fact on our first night of stay at the hotel as were too late and too tired to go out and find a place to eat we decide to eat Hotel Restaurant only and I must say that it was pathetic on all grounds be it taste or be it quantity. It was like a wastage of money which S$35-40 & we had to sleep starving that night. I would consider that as the biggest mistake in Singapore. We repented for our decision to eat there. Also, every morning we were served the same food, you can imagine that how does it feel to eat same thing every day for 7 good days . We were surprised that despite the fact that so many Indian families were staying at the property no efforts were made by their Chef to add some variety to the food. Everyone was complaining about the same and in fact we overheard people saying that they will not recommend this hotel to their friends & family just because of their poor food variety for vegetarians. They must implement changes in their restaurant menu and train their Chef in vegetarian cooking as well.Except the food, the service was great. Miss Rita is an outstanding person and a great wait staff

Ms Rita is a great staff. Good service and manners. The varieties of food for breakfast could be improved.

We chose Spices because of its reputation as a restaurant that has everything. From smorgasbord toal la carte, it had that and everything else going for it. The most discerning customer is catered for and with a fine selection of wines and spirits it is well worth considering as your venue for quality and quantity food. The service is brilliant. The prices are moderate. The menu is extensive. Do yourself a favour - give Spices at the Concorde Hotel a try. You wont be disappointed.Peter FJune 201

We stayed at thus hotel on the way to New Zealand & we used Spices for 3 buffet breakfasts & 1 buffet dinner.Having visited a few years ago we knew what to expect & we were really looking forward to it - we were not dissappointed!The buffet breakfasts are full of variety with just about everything you could wish for, and more!Similarly the buffet dinner is also absolutely superb with a wonderful variety of food for starters, mains & dessert.Quite why its called Spices cafe I don't know but make no mistake this is a truly wonderful restaurant!Just one thing to be aware of - the wine is really expensive. Thats the norm for Singapore but in Spices even more so! Don't let that put you off though...

Too much of a good thing is not bad Okay, that's an alliteration. But what else can I say. Breakfast buffet is sumptuous, seats are well spaced and the menu is more than what you need to fill that hunger. The in-house restaurant of Concorde Hotel should be a No-Miss on your list
4
Their service is excellent especially Ms. Rita. WELL DONE RITA. Food was the same all the time,, But it will be great if they have different menu each day for 1 week. Me and my hubby stayed for 1 week. Other then that everything was good. Once again Ms. RITA WELL DONE. And thank you.

Went there to celebrate my daughter birthday with a group of 25 people on 8 May.It was a good dinning experiences as the ambience was nice and service staffs are friendly and helpful. Although the buffet spread was not overwhelming with choices but I would consider quite sufficient to satisfy most diners.Many of my guests like the fresh Sashimi, cold prawn, mutton Satay, crispy soft shell crab and the live station of Laksa and Herbal prawn. The only disappointment is the "Selection of Crab", which was not what we expected it to be somehow and we think they could be do better since this selection are one of their highlighted dishes, next to one-serving each of lobster or abalone.By the way, the friendly staff would prepare a complimentary cake and sang birthday song, along with well wishes for any guest who celebrates their birthday there. We would not mind going back again next time as the overall experience was generally good and pleasant

Impressed. Very good spread including Sashimi and Oysters. I didn't think too much of the oysters as they were a little too salty and not so fresh by my taste but my other family members thought they were fine. Novelty was that you could choose unlimited ala carte from at least 6 crab dishes and each diner can choose between one complimentary serving of baked half lobster (200gms) or one complimentary serving of braised baby abalone with broccoli and mushroom. Nobody that night from what we saw went for the abalone! Really liked the Salty Egg Yoke Crab and Belacan Lobster. Those were the highlights of the night for me (other that of course the free flow sashimi) Will be back!> Monday to Thursday: 6.30pm to 10.00pmAdult: $52++ *Child: $20++> Friday, Saturday, Sunday and Eve of Public Holiday & Public Holiday: 6.30pm to 10.00pmAdult: $56++ *Child: $20+

Went there for buffet dinner on a Monday evening. It was rather quiet and we did have a relaxing dinner. Dinner comes with a choice of abalone or lobster, of course, we chose the lobster and free flow of crabs cooked in different sauces.The buffet spread is not great but enough to make you feel satisfied. Desserts are nyonya kuehs, ice cream, honeydew fondue...etc.Staff are friendly and service is great.We enjoyed the dinner
4
Lunch here for the past few days while on course. Varieties were moderately good. Ranging from self mix Rojak, laksa with cockles, kway chap, nasi ulam, udang petai, ayam buah kelua, oyster omelet, and a fair variety of nyoya kway kway. Price were reasonable about $35++ for lunch. Make reservation as it may be crowded.
5
if you are staying at the Concorde Hotel or in Singapore don't miss the daily weekday Singapore Flavours buffet. The food includes many Nyonya or Peranakan dishes only found in Nyonya restaurants. It's a great introduction to Singapore food in a great environment. The service is great too.
5
Lovely food. Can't comment for vegetarians. They always have a problem in every restaurant anyway. Try their paus. Some Singaporean delicacy i believe. Quite tasty.
4
breakfast is amazing because so many food could be chosen. staffs are very nice and helpful. recommended place to go.
5
it is impossible to go past the $50 seafood buffet. Exceptional value and range. Lots of locals eat here - so it must be good. We tried it and were not disappointed. Great service and wonderful food.
5
The evening dinner buffet was plentiful with loads of choices. Service was excellent as was the accompanying wine. The breakfast was also excellent with choices for many cultures, including an excellent English breakfast. I have no hesitation in recommending the Concorde culinary talents.....

Spices Café on the ground floor of the Concorde Hotel serves a nice buffet dinner with lots of choice. Especially the fish dishes were well prepared and tasty. The staff makes a serious effort to keep the buffet fresh and clean. Furthermore, the staff is polite and hospitable. Prices are at the high end of the expectation. When you stay in the Concorde hotel, an excellent buffet breakfast is served in this Spices Café

My spouse & I tried their breakfasts & dinner buffet, selections can be more but considered not bad. Food tastes ok. Ambience good. Staffs very friendly and professional. Their hotel room was excellent as we had a big suite and amenities were fantastic! Daily newspaper was catered and complimentary as part of the package. We had a wonderful time in Concorde Hotel Singapore! Thumbs up!!
4
The cafe has a Nonya buffet on during lunch hours. The food are authenic Nonya food. I like that they prepare the dessert in small portion so customers get to try the wide variety of dessert. This is a great place to get a taste of the local food.Try every thing on the buffet table. The cafe provides a wide variety and taste nice as well. Great service too.Reservation is a must as they are full everday

Every evening Spices Cafe puts on a $55 seafood buffet which is really nice and goes well with their extensive wine menu. The atmosphere is lovely with dimmed lighting and darker decor. Service is prompt, friendly, helpful and with a smile. The chef's are right ontop of restocking the buffet and are really nice and friendly. There is a really nice variety of cold and hot dishes. My favourite are the cold prawns, sushi and sashimi. I would really love to see plain steamed crab on the buffet though as I'm not fond of hot crab cooked in chilli sauce. Aside from that its perfect!

The irrepressible and debonair Travelling Gourmet goes to discover dark, devilish and decadent pleasures at…MARVELLOUS Choctober Festival Buffet in Concorde Hotel! While other hotels and restaurants are celebrating Germany’s Oktober Fest with Wurst (sausages) and beer, Concorde’s avant-guarde Executive Chef Sunny Goh is featuring for the whole month of October…a buffet with sweet ans savoury dishes all infused with Chocolate flavours and sauces! I like people who can think out of the box so I went to sample the chocolatey dishes and…My verdict : they were jolly good! The ancient Aztecs and Mexicans today love to eat savoury Chicken with Mole Pibiano which is a sauce made with chocolate!For an unusual appetiser, try Smoked Salmon dipped in White chocolate and BBQ Unagi (eel) with Sweet Soy Sauce and Bitter Chocolate. The sweet-savoury Chocolate sauce replaces the more mundane Teriyaki that is usually used.As a bonus, indulge in Abalone with Shitake and Broccolli or half a Lobster served a la minute. Mon dieu! J’adore the whole Abalone! Adorable Abalone has aphrodisiac qualities…Crab lovers take note! There are 5 types of crab for your dining pleasure. I love the spicy Thai Style Crab with Basil and the Chilli Crab. Crab with salted Duck Egg Yolk is good too! I saw a horizontally challenged lady scoffing umpteen helpings of crab with gusto! the Crab Claw crackers and special fork are provided.I also like the Chocolate Festival a la Carte Menu…especially the King Kong-sized Roast Rib Eye of Beef with a sexy Chocolate Red Wine Jus served with crunchy buttered Broccoli, Capsicum, Squash and Carrot plus Baby Roast Potatoes. The beef was nice and pink in the middle and simply fabulous with the sauce. Chocolate and red wine always goes hand in glove.Or how about that classic bayerische (bavarian) dish of Crispy Schweinshaxe (Pork Knuckle) with Green Apple, White and Brown Chocolate Sauces?With the tempting offerings, indulge in some intoxicating Cocktails! I liked the Minty Way in a Martini glass, with its stimulating menthol and medicinal flavours and velvety texture on my palate.t is concocted with White Creme de Menthe, Bailey’s Irish Cream liquer and Brown Creme de Cacao. You will enjoy coffee and coconut nuances in the White Forest Cocktail. This is blended with Pernod, White Creme de Cacao, Coconut Milk and Kahlua, the Mexican liquer. Turquoise Dream has a a sky bly colour due to the Blue Curacao, Milk and White Creme de Cacao. It is like an alcoholic milk shake!The diabolical Chocolate inspired desserts are absolutely fabulous! Chocolate Lava Cake with Raspberry and Chocolate Deco, White and Brown Chocolate Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream, Bitter Chocolate Mousse with Brandy Berry and lots more…The usual Chocolate Foumtains only have fresh fruits like Kiwi and Strawberries and Honeydew Melon but here there are also preserved dried Papaya Batons, dried Mango and Persimmon and Chinese Plums too. Most delicious dipped in the bubbly Chocolate Fountain.Cheese lovers can taste an assortment of Cheeses including Roquefort Blue Cheese with Apricots and Walnuts and big Raisins.Scientific research has shown that if you want to be happy…eat CHOCOLATE! That is because eating chocolate stimulates the brain to produce Endorphins. Endorphins make us feel good! According to Adam Drewnowski of the University of Michigan, “We want chocolate in times of stress, anxiety, pain and so on. Chocolate is a natural analgesic, or pain killer.” Phenyl-ethylamine (PEA) isin Chocolate. It occurs naturally in the brain and naturally reaches peak levels during the big “O”! Administering PEA increases dopamine levels, stimulating the pleasure centers…Chocolate also has aphrodisiac effects…Need I say more? The best way to deal with temptation is to…give into it.

Came here for friends gathering as spices celebrates nurses day and there's special offer for nurses! So we came down and tried their buffet. Place ambience is pretty good. We had unlimited serving of crab that is in 5 or 6 different favors. Each guest would have either baby abalone or half share of lobster. Both are nice and delicious! Oysters and salmon was very fresh. Will definitely come back for more seafood! Special thanks to Jane whom cleared our plates fast and was quick enough to come to us and answered our enquiries.

Breakfast buffet was fresh and had lots of choices. Staff were friendly and efficient. Coffee was god and refills offered frequently. Tasty omelettes made fresh to order. Busy but with a nice atmosphere.
5
Attentive staffs there at Spices Cafe. The warm smiles of the staffs there really made my meals nicer.
5
last nite my lady and I were treated to the best seafood buffet we have had in ages. I felt like a king feasting on fresh oyster crab lobster sashimi and all the trimmings. 50 sdg pp but worth it! If ever in Singapore you must try this tasty treat! Btw...the staff spoke excellent English and all were both helpful and friendly! Great job Tony and staff! We are hard to please and left VERY impressed

I ate here with my friends for my 21st birthday celebration. The buffet spread, although not a lot of variety compared to other buffets, was decent and tasty. We were allowed to choose between either grilled cheese lobster or baby abalone. Our group of 8 all chose the lobster. There is also free flow of crab served in either 5 or 6 different styles, and although the crab is not like those huge crabs, they were all still tasty. The oyster and sashimi were incredibly fresh and tasty as well. Overall, I would only recommend this buffet for those seafood lovers. if you're more into meats and desserts, don't waste your time and money here. But if you love your sashimi, oysters and shellfish, this buffet is definitely for you
5
Excellent Breakfasts. Catering for both Asian and Western tastes with a range of cooked and fresh products. A fine selection of freshly baked produce and good fruit and salad items. The staff circulate with Tea and Coffee and will likely do you a hot chocolate if you ask nicely.The fresh cooked eggs stand is a bit too close some of the seating; if you don't like the smell of eggs cooking sit on the other side of the restaurant. Maybe they could set up an overhead extractor fan?One minor point is their "selection of sliced cheeses" should be on separate plates as you cannot tell what it is you are selecting.
5
Unfortunately, I was in Singapore on Business and was dining alone. Eating at Spices was one of those experiences you want to share with the one you love.Fresh orchids on every table.Smooth criss-cross placemats.The nut-encrusted sweet bread was to die for.The iced coffee came in a cone shaped glass with a swirl on it - I wish we owned glasses as nice as that.Bottom line: Elegant. Luxurious.A bit more expensive than the street vendor meals, but worth treating yourself

My husband and I had a craving for seafood and decided to try the Harvest of the Sea dinner buffet at Spices Cafe. We were not disappointed. To start off we were told that each diner was entitled to half a grilled lobster or a baby abalone. We went for the lobster which was grilled with a cheese crust. If you're not fond of cheese or cream, then best to go for the abalone. There was plenty of seafood to choose from - fresh plump oysters, prawns, soft-shell crab, steamed fish etc. plus unlimited servings of crab cooked in 6 different ways. Last order for crabs is 9.30 pm. The dessert selection was admittedly not fantastic with the obligatory cakes and ice cream, but after you've enjoyed the array of seafood, I dare say you won't have much room for dessert anyway. The buffet includes coffee or tea.My husband and I had a feast and we agreed we would definitely go back
2
Overall, i have to give a very very poor rating to the spread of food and dessert served as buffet as, i ate nothing.1. Food spread - With the name of International Cuisine type of buffet, the food spread are really very limited.2. Dessert spread - same, the spread are really very limited
4
'Ma Kasi to the chefs and staff at "Spices CafÃ©" Singapore - for great service and an excellent variety of good Nonya food. Our group of nine enjoyed lunch today - WOW - the desserts - I'm still full this evening! Highly recommend this buffet for weekday lunch
3
We had breakfast included in our stay and during the three days there, the menu changed slightly. So for those who stay longer, repetitive menu could be a bore. There were Asian and Western selection, but for Concorde's standard, it pales in comparison to the Kuala Lumpur Concorde. If one were not choosy, the selection suffice, the scrambled eggs were good and I enjoyed it very much. It can't be said for the half boiled eggs that was requested and came almost 3/4 cooked. An egg station was provided but they use Parmesan sprinkle for omelette instead of cheese. Not so tasty! Fruits like pineapple was too ripe to the extent of bruised parts seen but it was still offered everyday.Overall, I would say okay but nothing spectacular
5
We were most amazed at the variety of food offered at the buffet, but even more so when staff showed us a menu of seafood specialties which were freshly cooked especially for us. Excellent and most reasonably priced dining experience.
5
Breakfast buffet was great with a large variety of items every morning. Ate breakfast there several mornings but never got bored of the food.
The staff is just as fantastic as food. They always greeted customers with a smile and courtesy.
5
All you can eat buffet with excellent choices for entrée, mains and sweets. Ate there for lunch twice, reasonable prices, friendly service and extensive delicious dishes to choose from.

The four of us ( Max,Maria,Garry and Patricia ) had dinner tonight at SpicesHarvest of the Sea Buffet , described as a Fresh succulent seafood Feast on a magnificent spread of seafood, including at least 6 crab dishes. To top that, each diner is served half a lobster .Let me tell you it was all this and more.The food was well presented ,plenty of variety and tasted incredible ,I personally love crab and tried all 6 versions ,my favorite was the chilli crab ,Garry liked the pepper best .The sushi,sashimi and tempura was of high quality and the oysters and scallops to me seemed extremely fresh and delicious .Both Garry and Maria also tried a pasta dish qand rated it highly.Next came the girls favorite Dessert ,and let me tell you there was no complaints whatsoever ,the choice and variations were great ,only the Durian was left alone ,( I don't know how someone can eat it with that smell ) Overall food perfect for choice and qualityAs for service ,our waitress was Mena ,what a gem ,she couldn't do enough for us and even helped us with our wine selection informing us of some specials.Once again Great Value and Servic

We had a stopover in Singapore on our way home from Europe and chose the Concorde Hotel. Spices Cafe, their inhouse restaurant was brilliant. Breakfast on both days was outstanding. A buffet encompassing many nationalities and traditions was impressive. The food was continuously topped up, and there was no shortage of anything that you required. If it wasn't on display, the staff were very obliging and would always assist you. We had the fixed price Buffet Seafood Banquet on Sunday evening and it would have to be up there with the very best we have ever had. An outstanding selection of food including lobster, chilli crab, prawns, oysters and a huge array of other hot dishes. Desserts were unbelievable and plentiful. Would highly recommend
5
We had a great lunch there a few times. Great dishes, be it Singaporean, malaysian , Indonesian, etc. It was buffet style. I love the Singapore chilli crab - with authentic local spices - but be prepared to go messy - using your fingers and thumbs, the only way to enjoy your crab - finger-licking yummy !You can ask for European dishes too, a la carte, but why do it, when you are in Singapore you want to go local. If you are not sure or not used to local dishes, are the service staff or the manager for advice, as they are only too happy to share their knowledge of local suisine with foreigners and convert you to a local-foodie

If you stay at the Concorde Hotel word of warning, don't order from the menu. We did instead of just taking the buffet option. The meals came out to us in a random order I have never experienced. My mothers main came out before our entrees, my wife ordered the caremelized octopus which everyone tasted and concluded it was deep fried pork crackle including my bro who is a qualified chef. That went back. Still no sign of our garlic bread mind you. When the remainder mains came out they were nothing like what was described in the menu either. We ended up walking out in discust and going outside to the hawker stalls. Way better value and flavour. Try the buffet if you like, we didn't but that was way over priced. I did feel very sorry for the matradee, he was very apologetic

This place offers value for money lunch buffet of peranakan cuisine on weekdays. Ambience is good and so is the service! A good choice since I wanted to immerse my sis-in-law and her sister into my baba & nonya culture. The food served is not intimidating and more suited to people new to Straits Chinese food. I love the meatball soup, nasi kunyit, kueh kueh, local desserts, and ayam buah keluak except there were no buah keluak left when I finally got to it! There was even petai! We had a great reunion on this end of May

Had buffet dinner at Spices CafÃ© and cost like S$52++ per pax on weekends. The place is good if you do not like crowd. The buffet is good and includes one serving of lobster (3 choices - Butter, XO Sauce and Thai Sauce) and crab (4 choices - Thai Sauce, Butter, Black Pepper and Chilli). The lobster was good while the crab was not that fresh. Pasta and stewed beef were excellent. Do note that beverages are not included in the buffet, you will have to pay additional for it. Overall, I had a nice meal and would go back again
4
This is a place for those who enjoy Peranakan cuisine or the adventurous for those who have yet to try it. In a modern decor, mainly black and red, slightly "baroque" one could say, you will be presented with a large variety of typical Asian Peranakan dishes as well as a great spread of delicious local desserts like ice kachang, cendol etc. This "all you can eat buffet" is also reasonably priced.Pictured here, a very special salad called"Rojak" only for the brave tourist or the locals of course
5
I love it. the place is really awesome. they really served good food & the environment is really cool.
5
Although the variety were not as many as 5-stars hotels, but most of it (which I tried to taste them) were ok. Try the fishball soup (serve with or without mee/noodle).
4
I was even given a bib by Rahimah Bte Othman Assistant Restaurant Manager she was great fun and made the meal very enjoyable
5
the lobster mornay and all the buffet is so good, Have told everyone visiting Singapore to go there! Best value for money, a must on every trip to Singapore
4
Excellent, attentive service and good food in a beautiful restaurant within the hotel. The fish and chips were delicious!
5
The menu has a excellent variety but they may also run a monthly buffet special. Their prices are reasonable.
4
The friendliness of the staff especially the lady handling the omelette station - I literally returned everyday of my stay just to have a taste of the omelette! However, I was kind of appalled when they placed non-halal food next to halal ones.
5
Our family celebrated our New Year's Day lunch at the Spices Cafe and we came out completely pleased and satisfied with their food, service, and ambience. What a delicious spread! My wife and I enjoyed the seafood appetizers (especially the fresh oysters, prawns, tuna, and salmon) while our two daughters relished the salad (especially the mozzarella balls with basil and the creamy dressing for the lettuce greens). The roasted strip sirloin at the carving station was tender, juicy, and cooked perfectly, and the red wine sauce enhanced its flavor. We sampled a variety of dim sum and tempura but were getting full to try the laksa even though the aroma from the laksa station was so enticing. My wife and I ended our meal with a cup of flavorful cream of wild mushroom soup. For dessert, we loved the passion fruit mousse, chocolate mousse, bread pudding with vanilla cream, and mini cream puffs. The service was very good! The serving staff was always present to attend to our needs quickly, be they clearing our table of used plates or filling our water glasses. When I asked if decaf coffee was available, our server said she would make me one even though it wasn't offered. Thus, I was able to savor my dessert with a perfect cup of coffee! We are definitely looking forward to our return to Spices Cafe. And that will likely to be soon because we will have some relatives visiting in a month. We cannot think of a better place to treat them to lunch

Convenient choice if you stay at the hotel Concorde and don't want to go out at night. The restaurant has buffet style dinners every night. A la carte menu is limited and not very exciting. We were the only ones eating a la carte and were a bit overwhelmed by the large groups of Chinese who were there for the buffet dinner. Not the place for a cosy dinner.
3
Took the opportunity to eat one evening at the Concorde Hotel, while we were staying there. The menu has a wide variety of dishes, and I choose typical food for Singapore. The food was very good and tasty, but unfortunately the service could be more attentive and better
