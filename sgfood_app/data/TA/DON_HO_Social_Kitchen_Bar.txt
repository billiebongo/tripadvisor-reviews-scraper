Lovely spot for a lazy Sunday brunch, delicious food, very good Bloody Mary, friendly and charming service, nice ambience...... overall really most enjoyable.

We went for Sunday brunch, the ambience was good, as was the choice of background music, just the right volume too. Service was attentive as well. Not a large brunch menu so that set my expectations for some great flavors. We had a salad, the sticky back ribs and pork belly sandwich. Good job we had chicken in the salad otherwise it would have been totally flavorless, oily and bland. The beef was fall apart, and it came with beautiful pureed potatoes and sauce. But it just lacked any depth of flavor. The pork belly sandwich fared a little better, good flavors but the flat bread was not crisp and far too doughyfoe my taste. Go foe the 2 hour free flow of prosecco at 48 per pax, but the food is just average.

This place is probably more popular for dinner and drinks but I happen to go there on a weekend with my friends to have brunch. The deco was done up very nicely and although most people mentioned that it looked "Hawaiian", I personally felt that it gave me more of a Bali/beach feel! They have an open kitchen concept so it was quite interesting to see something like that in Singapore as you seldom have something like that here unless you go for Japanese teppanyaki or something. The food was so-so but the coffee was pretty good! (Btw, I ordered a cup of flat white)If you were to visit this place for the first time, don't be confused by the address - it shares the same address (i.e. The Working Capitol) as a couple of restaurants (e.g. Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant). Fun fact: "Don Ho" is the name of a Hawaiian musician; he was an entertainer who was pretty popular in the 1960s

Decent service but the food is not that great, had crispy eggplant, the sauce was not spicy but extremley sweet full of sugar. We also had some (huge bowl) brussel sprouts which were terribly sweet and you coudln't even taste pancetta. The worst was the king prawn they are charging 16++ for one small single king prawn literally 2 bites. Honestly I have never seen a bigger rip off in my life. Its not even enough for one person never mind it being a sharing plate. Smoked salmon and fries were decent. Please have a look at your portions they are not consistent at all. I get the concept you are trying to convey but it's not working. I can now see more people have commented on poor portion sizes for the prices

We booked a table for 5 at a weeks notice despite friends telling us that 'it was booked months in advance'. The tip is if you really want a booking in a restaurant try calling them or get a hotel to call - it worked for me for an important client in Shanghai!The restaurant was brightly lit but not stary and the walls were brightly painted in a jungle theme with an 'open' kitchen which we noticed kept a couple of small children entertained. Although we didn't have children it appears this is a 'child friendly' 'restaurant'. The menu style is tapas with larger portions available to share. It has a good selection of meats, seafood and vegetarian options and the dishes we ordered were all excellent. The only comment o would make is that the beef short ribs were slightly too rich for us all - but by then we'd all had a number of dishes and were already full! They also have a great selection of cocktails to choose from and the staff are really helpful and friendly. I'd highly recommend the restauran

I’ve been to DON HO a few times and love it. A friend mentioned that the TripAdvisor score wasn’t great, and when I read the reviews it’s like reading about a completely different restaurant.The ‘white’ lady manager (I find it just crazy that people in the 21st century would publish such casual racism on such a public site - or have those views at all) is smart and professional, and is always smiling despite how wild and busy the restaurant is. The staff sometimes seem a little overwhelmed but are always friendly and I’ve never had a bad service experience.The portions are the right size for a sharing concept - we’re always stuffed at the end of the meal! The prices reflect the quality - if you don’t want to pay more than $60 per head it’s not the place for you (and neither are any of the other restaurants along Keong Saik Road).The Assistant Manager (Caz?) although quiet seems to bring it all together.. he also makes the best Singapore Sling (or similar?!) in town!And lastly, the decor - yes it’s beautiful, the most green and tropical place you’ll find in Singapore :)So definitely go and check it out, well worth a visit

Delicious food but small portions though. Sharing concept basically. The cote de boeuf is a must try! Highlight of our evening is definitely the lovely, amazing cocktails. Delicious sharing jugs! The hostess was prompt in updating us about the second seating. So being on time for your reservation is advisable. All in all, great service and lovely ambience

- very rude hostess while taking a booking- was suddenly "informed" there is second seating for our table whereby restaurant was half empty, we must order fast and get lost, well that is the message received- server was too excited to clear our plate and wine even though we have not finished them, not only asking to clear way too often, they also took it without permission- way overpriced, portion way too ridiculously small- we were "accidentally" charged one more glass of wine than what we actually orderedThis place gets a lot of talk in town solely due to their decor, everything else that matters is not up to any standar

Went with a couple of friends and ordered a bottle of wine to go with the meal. Portion size were miniscule for the price charged. I was still hungry after the meal and had to go to another restaurant for 2nd dinner that night. However, that was surprisingly not the worst part about the restaurants. Apparently they had a 2nd seating which was not informed to us. Staff suddenly appeared to inform us they were taking last orders at which point we were told had to evacuate our seats for the next sitting even though we had yet to finish wine. We had to chug our wine and leave soon after. NOT acceptable for the price this place is charging. Avoid

Came by the DON HO for a brunch with a couple of friends. The place wasn't hard to find although other sites mentioned that you had to enter through the back alley. The poke place is still around though! The sitting was unique as it had both sofa and chairs which is great for groups. Items are slightly pricey, big eats may not find this place filling

I know good food when i taste one. One of the worst or definitely the worst dining experience. Had a birthday dinner to impress my girlfriend and her friends, when the food came, the portion was like for my 2 year old toddler nephew. Oh maybe i thought the taste would counter the portion but no. Overpriced small quantity food. I’d rather spend my $500 elsewhere. I do not recommend and will never ever go back.

Wednesday evening so not full at all but it took ages to place the order and get the bill.OVERPRICED! Pathetic tuna tataki plate... I thought someone eaten half of it on the way to the table! No taste. Poor wine list, and half not even available.BA

Extremely rude manager who was no respect for customers! Requested for a table inside the restaurant which I specified prior to booking the table and when I got to the restaurant and they had not given us a table inside, I asked the wait staff who approached the manager. Manager came out and spoke to us in a very condescending tone and basically said if we were not happy with the table she was happy to cancel our booking and to leave?! Seriously?! I’m sorry but that is not how you speak to your customers. Disrespectful. Rude. Very unfriendly attitude. Very very poor service

Each portion is priced high to begin with for a tapas dish, but when the tiny portion came to the table we thought it was a joke! 2 pieces of scallop at 24 Dollars! All the so-called sharing platters were too small to share, and the price horrendous...The cocktails were sickening sweet from too much syrup, and again high price...At 8.30pm we were asked to leave to make room for more guests, and we had just ordered our third round of tapas and drinks. Nobody told us that we had to leave at that time when we entered. They were quite rude about it, and I noticed the guests at the neighboring table also were surprised at being asked to leave.Staff were attentive only until we had ordered, after that it was nearly impossible to get hold of them to re-order drinks.Most of them also quite knowledgeable about the contents in the food, saying there is egg in the eggplant dish (there was not)...Some of the tapas dishes were good, like the crispy eggplant, mussels and beef cheek. The rest were quite tasteless.Definitely not worth the price and getting thrown out of the restaurant...At least the 4 of us have a very negative impression about the treatment and prices / value

The décor was really cool, but that's about where the compliments end. The drinks here were average, but the food was just "blah", and totally not worth the price - all with the exception of 1 dish: the crispy eggplant, which we had 3 servings of (for 4 of us). The staff were pretty friendly, but the service was horrendous! They kept coming to our table with items (for AND drinks) we did not order repetitively, even despite us telling them that we were done with our orders. Our bill was wrongly tallied up (with stuff we didn't even get added to it), and when they finally got the bill right, they took ages to process our payment. Definitely not going back there again.

The food portions are ridiculously small for the price and the quality is honestly nothing to write home about. The bartender is unfriendly and looks as if he'd rather be elsewhere. Cocktails weren't good either. Halfway through dinner they asked us to move towards the end of the bar to sit behind the decoration... I would not recommend it to anyone and I will definitely never go back.

I visited here recently with a group of friends to celebrate my birthday. I had heard good things and they all lived up to and surpassed my expectations. The restaurant has a welcoming, funky and tropical vibe. The service was instantly great with the staff just really on the ball and knowledgeable. They made us feel so looked after. The food was amazing. We had a mix of dishes and each and every one was really good. The flavours were amazing. Even their simple carrots melted in the mouth. I could reel off each dish as each one had interesting flavours and textures and made for a meal that really got the taste buds going. I could not recommend this place highly enough and all my friends were wowed by it! we were all discussing which dishes we were craving the next day! Great food, ambience and service - a must try

Love this restaurant, such a great vibe!! Great atmosphere for a group of friends, very reasonably priced wine, great dishes and great cocktails. There is a bar in the restaurant and at the end of the evening they have a disco ball and GREAT music. I would recommend the later sitting if booking so you can enjoy the full experience of Don Ho.

This is a gem. Ok be of our friends in Singapore we were staying with recommended it to us. I'm vegetarian and I loved it. The rest of our party eat meat and fish and they were eqaully impressed.Each tapas style dish was superb Service was good and the 2 for 1 drinks promotions on the rose on Tuesdays made this a well priced meal. I would recommend this place for a modern tapa

Had a great time in this new restaurant located between Tanjong Pagar and Outram. The food is amazing and so are the cocktails. OK for a cocktail night as well and a brunch is available. However the service needs to be improved but honestly can be easily forgiven when you consider that the place has been recently opened. To try urgently ;)

Great menu with a lot of choice, all the worldwide classics, great cocktails, don't miss ladies night on thursday's.. The bred is so good because it is homemade. Service is fast, sadly reservation needed; but that is the success I guess.

It's a little place but so tastefully done. Very attentive staff n the food was awesome. One of my favorites, the crispy eggplant!
5
Beautiful food served with a smile. The meal was well hosted, offering quality food followed by a lovely social atmosphere by the bar. Highly recommended as a warm welcoming feel from the staff and owners
5
Food is amazing though rather small portion but price is still reasonable for the quality given. Love the ambiance there and the people who come there. Attendants are lovely and constantly checking whether everything is ok in a nice and warm way.

Love how cool and cosy this restaurant is. You go in from the back door that adds to it's mystery. Inside decor is chic enough and I like Restaurants who get the lighting correct-- dim and soft enough to make you feel relaxed!! Beautiful date place. Most ladies will like this ambiance--! Food good too

Very nice food, the food is tapas style so good for sharing. The atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice and lively. Good for a pre party dinner. The ribs and the scallops are still wrestling about which one was the tastier dish of them two The min burgers was also amazing.
4
They recommend 3 dishes per person. 4 of us had 9 dishes and couldn't quite finish. Would recommend the crispy eggplant and beef short ribs. The clams and scallops were good as well. If you are looking for something that would fill your stomach, try the pumpkin and sweet potato. We took the 6.30 seating but weren't chased away so I guessed the 8.30 didn't show up. The music does get loud towards the later part, and we left eventually cos it was impossible to have a conversation without shouting. Great experience overall.

Was there for my partner's birthday celebration with a groun of friends and decided to try Don Ho.OMG, We all Love the ambience and deco of Don Ho, and the little disco ball :)Food is amazing and our favourite is the crispy egg plants. Mouth watering good.Service was fast and great. Staff very welcome and polite A big applaud to the relationship manager, she was very attentive and top notch service.Though shortly after our meal and desserts were done, there was a power trip and the whole restaurant became stuffy. Hence my friends and I decided to leave. The relationship manager offered to give us 10% discount, but we rejected the offer since it was not their fault. But we thanked them anyway.Will definitely recommend Don Ho

Don Ho is only a 2 month old restaurant with the promise of something big. It is relatively small (About 40 customers at best) and one has to walk behind a building on the road to get into it. Once inside, the first thing that struck me was that it was very lively. The staff greeted us with warm smiles. Customers seemed to enjoy being there. The open kitchen and aroma of food added to the ambience. The beat of the music seemed to complement the mood in the place. The food was fabulous. The flat bread, fried aubergine, sweet potato with pumpkin, pimentos and hummus with focaccia were all good. Service was attentive. The medium-sized portions made it possible for us to try out many dishes. My colleagues and I had a great time. Reservations are recommended to ensure you are not disappointed

There are 2 seatings for this restaurant (6:30 and 8:30pm) so make sure you book a table as given how popular this place currently is, you would not be able to do a casual walk-in.We started with cocktails and they did not disappoint! The cocktails, in my opinion, were better than the food. The tapas portions were pretty small given their price tag and nothing really stood out.We shared the lamb dish as our main and we were quite satisfied with it when it first arrived. The portion was huge! But after a few bites, we had to stop as it was just too salty.Their version of the chocolate lava cake ("self-saucing chocolate pudding") was pretty good! Is it worth a return visit? I am not quite sure
