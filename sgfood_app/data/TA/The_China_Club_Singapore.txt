I brought my Indonesian friend for dim sum breakfast. On Saturday, they have 50% discount for selected dim sum. Food was prepared upon ordered. Situated on the 52nd floor, this place is great to impress my guests with its awesome view and chic oriental decor.
5
This was my first visit here and I was wowed by the elegant and stylist interior, fantastic view of the city skyline, prompt yet discreet service and the food was just cooked and presented beautifully. Would recommend for business and special occasions.
4
The moment we sat down, the attention to our needs has been awesome. Food is exquisite. Best to go evening as the skyline will be fantastic but do ask for a window seat for sure.
5
Exquisitely Chinese style to enjoy the culinary art of food. Every bite close to you at heaven. Sky line view. Membership only.
5
I was invited by a member to the restaurant for dinner. Fantastic view from 52nd floor and excellent ambience. Food was very good as well. Definitely worth visiting (with a member).

Visit during lunch for business entertainment of 2 of our business partners from Guangzhou. The restaurant decoration is impressive however the table space is very petty. Our order for 5 paxs has to be split into 4 rounds due to no sufficient table space. They give us a round table next to the pillar, away from window, whose size fit for 2-3 paxs, to accomodate 5 of us. We drop the chopstick few times as we did not even have proper space to place the chopstick. Good things the staff fast enough to replace our chopsticks each time it dropped on the floorDefinitely not the best experience to deliver to our business partners. I would consider coming back for informal family dinner, but NOT for formal and important business meeting
5
We went up to The China Club, and it was a good experience. Service was quick, fast and always friendly. The food was great, and we had a fun time. This place has a very nice feel to it. It is very fancy, yet casual. The views are also amazing, being able to see the whole of downtown Singapore as well as the sea makes its extra special. The only thing that I was not a fan to was the Chili. The Chili was soggy and mushy. Other than that, it is a unique restaurant and is definitely something to check out!
3
Great view and very effective service were the highlights for our business breakfast.The venue is quite formal and a little stuffy for my style and the food was just ok.
5
Very nice location! Amazing view of the city landscape on one side and sea on the other side! Booked a table facing sea! Nice decor but with a price! Pre-booking required! Authentic Chinese food delicacies! Tasted lemon Grass jelly! It was amazing! Jasmine Tea provided with lunch! A lot of different varieties available! Worth trying!
5
I realize that the only way to dine at The China Club is to know a member and we were lucky enough to have a local friend who took us there. We toured the entire floor with views that stretched from Indonesia to Malaysia before settling into a private dining room for dinner as we watched the sun set over Singapore and the lights of the city below began to glow. The service was impeccable, the food phenomenal. Probably the best Peking Duck we've ever had. Crisp, fresh vegetables, delectable desserts. One of the best meals we had in Asia.
4
Nice and sumptuous food and Tim sum. Very very good view, 52 floor and ambience. Nice place for gathering and family celebration. Convenient and accessible to MRT and public transport.
5
This place is very special to visit, the service brings your mind back to old china. The food is top class!
4
The highlight of the restaurant is the view. At dinner time one gets to see a panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. Fine dining experience of Chinese food is also great. Good food and good service
4
It was not crowded that Friday when we dropped in for an hour lunch meeting. The set came at a good pace and were tasty & flavourful. The waitresses were polite and attentive. For first timers, the decorations of the Mao era is quite a treat
4
Being spoilt for choice, there are hardly pleasant surprises when it comes to food in Singapore but this was it. They were part of the business set lunch but each dish was very tasty and well presented. For the first time ever, I was reluctant to leave a business lunch for my next appointment as I was looking forward to complete the meal!I do have to say though that the dress code was a little inconvenient. My business wear involves fitness attires and running shoes, so I had to borrow a jacket at the last minutes to avoid the risk of being denied entry
3
I was invited here and wasn't surprised that it was a restaurant from another era, very unmodern even down to suggest I wear a jacket as I wear a t-shirt for work, they kindly compromised by putting the jacket on my seat.Food was ok not great, service was ok, nothing special all round. Views are great but many better restaurants have both food, service, ambience and views....the ambience here was lacking and it didn't make me personally feel comfortable, wouldn't come bac
4
Located on the 52nd floor of one of Singapore business district towers, the view is obviously amazing. This is a club so we were invited by a member.Very good and fast service which is great for a business meals.I appreciated the tea menu which gives you ample choice to taste among a dozen varieties. We had a lovely pot of jasmine.Reasonable choice of dimsums well prepared with a thin dough. All followed by the duck mentioned below, large bowls of laksa soup from Singapore, a delicate. Duo of clams with asparagus and some stir fried greens which were very tender. Light enough to let us discuss our business
4
Another business lunch - an excellent spot. As you know Singapore can be very busy during lunch time and if you have a client and want some time to talk - this is a good location. The place has an excellent view and the service is wonderful.
4
We had a group dinner at this restaurant, which is located on the top floor of a sky scraper and offers magnificent 360 views over Singapore.The decor is quite elaborate and is recreating the atmosphere of past Chinese glory. It reminded me of the China Club in Berlin which I frequently visited.p. Whilst views and atmosphere are both spectacularly for the food.We had a set menu of various dishes, all of which were exquisite. My favourite was the Beijing duck
5
The views from the China club are spectacular at any time of day. The bar looks over the Barbour to sentosa. The drinks are reasonable and great lychee Martini's. The food is also reasonable and very good. What is great about this place is the exclusivity and location.
5
You get what you pay for and I don't mind paying lots of $$$ when its worth it. Great food, faultless service and fabulous views.
5
What a great spot to be in Singapore. On the high floor of high riser you have the best 360 degree view of Singapore. With the amazing ambience you feel like to be in old China. Five stars for the service and food.
4
The view from the restaurant is amazing - especially if you time it for sundown. The staff are discreet and attentive in equal measure. The food is a blend of traditionally Chinese and French - extremely rich and well presented.
5
Apart from the fantastic view, the martini and the food were spectacular.
Especially love the crab claw in two sauces and the XO prawn.
Definitely worth a visit if you can get in!!
5
Should I not say many cuts above? In my opinion, China Club in Singapore is more than that. Food-wise, heavenly. Service-wise, right-on. Price-wise, equally good, but that's where you put the mouth to, isn't it? Excellent place. Well done, Maestro GM Andrew Mah.
4
The food was really good, the service was as well. Great atmosphere for a business lunch. The view was incredible. I have had dinner there as well and the view is even better at night.
3
Had 13-course (!) business lunch in a private room overlooking the container harbour. The view is spectacular and the room was nice. Service was very efficient.However, in terms of food, I was quite a bit disappointed. It started well with good dumplings but it got worse when it came to the Peking Duck: no taste, almost cold. We moved to avalones that were almost as hard as rock and did not have a great taste....Overall a bit disappointin
2
This is our 3rd time having lunch set in China Club. We found the quality and standard had dropped a lot. The Peking duck pancake, pancake was not warm and looks "overnight". The hot and sour soup also taste diluted compared to the past. The chicken fillet and Deep fried fillet were the only two tasty dishes. The braised e-fu noodle was soggy. In short, quality had dropped a lot.
1
While the food was tasty, it was expensive and came in very small portions. The pork belly for example was $25 for a small portion. A kilo of free range pork belly (even in Singapore) sells for $18. I asked for a Campari Soda and was given a Cranberry and Soda.What really shocked me that this restaurant has an entire page dedicated to Sharks Fin soup. There are over ten different types of sharks fin soup on the menu. The plight of sharks is well known and it was simply heartbreaking to see such a callous disregard for endangered species
4
The stunning views set the tone for a great business lunch and good food tips the balance. It is definitely a good place to bring clients, family or friends in CBD area
4
Fabulous food. Very private. Fantastic views of the city.
Food was fresh and flavourful.
A memorable evening with great friends.

Three of us were there for dim sum lunch. With the UOB Lady solitaire card, you get access to the restaurant. It has 50% off dim sum on Saturday. Located on the 52nd floor, you get a stunning view of Singapore skyline. The dim sum was above average, we had the fried carrot cake, chee cheong fun with prawn filling, prawn dumpling, fried bean curd skin roll. We also ordered the seafood Hor fun, it was delicious and full of fresh prawns and scallops. The staff was attentive and responsive. The place was quiet and comfortable with tables placed fairly apart. We will definitely return for another meal
4
I've dined many times at this club & every experience has been very good. Book a private room for dinner & arrive before sunset to enjoy the lovely skyline view & a drink. The cocktails are not exceptional; have a Tiger Beer, a Scotch whisky or wine. The wine list is not extensive but has some good selections at a reasonable price. I usually bring a vintage champagne because the views & privacy encourage a convivial atmosphere before settling down to a fine meal. If you prepare ahead a set menu for just one table of guests, get the manager's advice and expect an unusually good meal. Keep the number of courses small - 4/5 is good, 6 max (including dessert) because the individually served courses are not small. There is a good variety of Chinese teas to accompany the meal. I won't recommend any dishes because the manager will do a better job
4
Business event with a large group of people for a set menuAttention to detail , presentation of dishes and service was all very good. Food was nice but some courses were not what I would typically order and not to my taste however it was very fresh and to a high standard Beautiful setting and vie
5
Had the most enjoyable dining experience hosted by a wonderful friend, Melanie, who is a member of the China Club. The interior design was amazing, the 360 degree views were astounding and the food served was of the highest quality. But for me, the most treasured element of the China Club should be their staff; their service is unparalleled. I've travelled extensively and have been fortunate to have had many sublime epicurean experiences, and the China Club is right up there with the world's best. Also, as we were walking out after a sumptuous meal, the staff called us back due to a problem with the bill. My host was a bit concerned about any potential issue with her credit card payment - but it turned out that the restaurant had not given her the full discounted rate across all items and hence called us back so they could refund her! Now, this isn't something you see everyday! Credit to the staff for their honesty and valuing the customer relationship. Kenneth Kon

Our new boss gave our team a dinner treat at this private club. Great ambience and food in a private room. Heard it was very expensive but worth it
5
Exclusive place with a stunning view of the city, the China Club was quite an experience. The drinks were terrific, the staff more than friendly, and the Peking Duck the best I've ever had. It was an evening to remember. Go if you can
5
Went here with our Property Profile Group from Australia in mid June... very exclusive to get into, discreet entrance, 57th floor location and arguably some of the finest views of the city. We had a 6 or 7 course dinner from memory. Food was scrumptious and we had wonderful company. My highlight of my 3 day stay in Singapore. A once in a lifetime experience for me
5
The view is breathtaking. You can walk around he Restaurent which is on the 52nd floor and see all of Singapore beneath you.The service is personalized and exclusive and the food is very gourmet. The bartender Hellen makes great Martini's
5
If you ever have an opportunity to visit or join this Club you should ! The first thing that you are overwhelmed by is the fabulous dÃ©cor. The view is amazing but the interior design of the club is spectacular. The long bar is especially well done and is perfect for a quiet drink by yourself or a larger group of friends. The service is immaculate. The bar has a range of smaller dishes which are delightful especially the pork belly. The restaurant rooms are spacious and again have fantastic views. The food is good value and the range of wines is vast. The staff are always welcoming and their beautifully pressed uniforms add to the ambience of the Club. Again, if you ever get the chance to go to the China Club in Singapore you should definitely take up the offer

Sad to say, i dont think that i will visit china club Singapore anymore. I gained entry into this venue because of my credit card and understanding that this is an very exclusive venue. However, after 1 family lunch with my parents and the recent business lunch where i told my secretary that i would bring her to a fancy restaurant... i must say that i ended up underwhelmed both times.Firstly, the food is not exceptional. Secondly, the mainland chinese waitress who served us could not speak english and had no answer when quizzed in the details of the menu. That really does not befit a restaurant of such standing. Thirdly, the diners who were seated near us were talking at the top of their lungs ( locals, mind you). I suppose china club is just not drawing the type of patrons I imagine they should be attracting. Therefore.... so long. Tata..
5
Had a delicious dim sum over panoramic views of the port, and the waiting staff was attentive . The quietness and exclusivity meant we could discuss work without having to shout my voice hoarse over the noise of crowds. It was overall a great dining experience ! Keep it up 
5
China club is one of my favorite dining/happy hour venue in Singapore. It offers stunning 360 degree view from the top of Capital Tower; the food is top notch Chinese style. Ambience & service are kinda unparalled too. I especially like its exclusivity which means this place never gets too crowded or noisy. I love to go there with friends for happy hour drinks at the Long March bar, or Saturday dim sum brunch, or a romantic dinner out. 2 thumbs up
2
First off, I heard its good and review is fantastic. So let's start from basic, Dim sum. The dim sum have 50% and weekend business is quiet so best time to try.With much anticipation, here comes, a few issue...1) why must all be put at the same area when the restaurant is so big? This is not a normal diner, but an exquisite restaurant isn't it?2) service, the details, attention and service attitude is ok, but jus plain normal, unlike what it is claim and meant to be. No attention to detail at all. I can name many that have it.3) dim sum, the peanut that serve as condiment is tasteless. The dim sum which is 50% is really so average that any neighborhood dim sum will be on par. The skin of Chee Cheong fun is thick n tasteless, the Har kow n Siew Mai lack appearance, detail and taste. Can anyone compare a simple diner like Victors kitchen or fine dim sum restaurant like hua ting?As a members club place and poise to be one of the best, these are all very basic quality and taste. Now I know why the weekend is lack lustre with not much people and hype while other dim sum is packed all 3 cycle of lunch.The management should really seriously consider tasting them selves like a mystery guest and tell me if this is any good. Thanks

Some friends treated me to dim sum at the China Club, and I had a wonderful time. The setting is beautiful high atop a Singapore skyscraper. The decor is tastefully and beautifully designed with a wealth of Asian art. I thought the food was delicious and the service very timely. I can't comment on the value for the money since I was a guest. It's clear you can't just walk in. You must pass through a guarded turnstile to even enter the proper elevator. I had a terrific experience and would recommend it to others

Was invited for dinner there by a relative. Very nicely decorated and great view of the city. Food was nice but I think we are also paying for the view and the suppository exclusiveness of the club. It would have been a pleasant dinner if not of number small comments by the manager and waitress. It was a weekday and as my host was aware that children are only allowed during weekend he called ahead to clarify if my teenage children can come in to dine. They told him OK. During our visit we were told twice that children are not allowed during weekday. I'd respect the rule if that is what it is but please sort out your internal communication with your telephone reception people please

This place has a beautiful environment and view.Service staff are efficient.Food is way below par as compared to other restaurants serving the same kind of food

located on the top three floors of the old Bank of China Building in Central Hong Kong. Must get their prior to sunset. Designed with a strong sense of tradition and history, with motifs widely used in Hong Kong and Shanghai in the 1930’s and 1940’s, the Club contains paintings and sculptures by Chinese artists from China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. I was lucky to arrange a booking via some work contact prior to arriving in Singapore or I would never never got in. Excellence is a true word if!!! It is simply that exclusive, that expensive formal with a sure dress code.The first time I was guest with my work, we had a private room with a special menu full of the most splendid food rich dishes complimented with the extraordinary Singapore view and the waiters so well trained. You cannot be afraid of hight because you could have a table against the window or if lucky on a platform hight.Unfortunately the second time I went their I hated the place. They were rude so not welcoming and the menu that I had to choose from was nothing like my first splendid experience. Just a starter drink cost a fortune and when we did try to have an explanation of their menu the answers were so sharp that I was really offended, my feeling was like I was wasting their time that I got up and left the club/restaurant saying to the waiter "remember me you served me when I visited a few month ago when I was part of a work delegation"Well we are going never to set foot again here.Keep the attitude to yourself

As long standing members of the China Club in HK, we got a membership for the China Club here in Singapore.Generally the food is of a high quality, however they are nowhere nearly as strict in their dress code as in Hong Kong. On occasion we have come with business associates only to see people in shorts and flip-flops, jeans, very casual vests. I know SG is less dressy than HK but couldn't a minimum of standards be observed?It is even worse when there is a wedding or other event - oh my gosh, do people have so little respect for their hosts?The wait staff is very genteel and courteous and helpful in making choices.The airconditioning is generally freezing, so you're advised to dress warmly or bring along a shawl - or one is provided on request.It's also a good location for a view of Singapore - including fireworks and the laser show
4
The ambience befits the name. Elegant orientalism exudes class and history. Artifacts, paintings and lovely tableware. Perfect place for entertaining. Food, however, is slightly above average and one would have expected better. Service was excellent
5
At the top floor with a good view of the surrounding skyliners in the central business district, this members-only club is a nice venue for private events and business meals. Their oriental-theme furnishing and Chinese cuisine will impress out-of-towners. This is definitely a more classy spot with a view to bring business associates or dates vs. the other penthouse clubs like Ku De Ta. Service level is always top-notch too
5
nice place but only for member. bring in by one of my friend who was invited to try.price of food not expensive but too expensive to join member like 100 thousand to be membe
4
I've visited The China Club a few times over the years and the food quality remains unchanged and the service staff, always polite and sincere. It is as perfect a place for a corporate meal as it is for a family/friend get-together (take note though that they discourage admission for kids below 12 on weekdays). The lunch set we had recently was a good deal and nicely portioned. The restaurant offers awesome views all around
4
i have been a frequent vistor to China Club over the years. The dim sum makes a good light lunch and is always consistent in quality. Although a bit expensive the environment, service and food are always good.Excellent for entertaining guests especially if its a clear day
5
I ate here with a group from work, and they did a great job of hosting such a large group (there were around 70 of us). We had a taster menu with around 7 courses, including veggie and pescetarian versions which was lovely to see. The service was superb, meals were served in good co-ordination across individual tables and then the whole room, glasses refilled regularly etc.The food was innovative and very tasty, we all enjoyed the meal.This would be a great spot for a special occasion
5
I was lucky enough to be hosted at a business lunch at the China Club and as expected it was excellent all round (Whilst we lived in Hong Kong we were fortunate enought to go to the China Club in Central a number of times and it was always a brilliant experience so I was expecting something simnilar - it did not disappoint). The view is of course magnificent; the service is very non-invasive and professional; the food very flavourful and fresh and the overall experience excellent from start to finish. If you're ever able to, you should try to get in with a member and experience the China Club. You will never forget it
5
The views from this restaurant ARE spectacular as everyone who visits will agree. The food is Chinese as you would expect and the chefs will cook pretty much anything that you desire. The Peking Duck served in the traditional style with pancake rolls and cucumber, onions and plum sauce is sumptuous and all the work is done by the waiters. The belly pork is another favourite of ours and is always added to our order.From the moment you step out of the lift on the 52nd floor you know know that the evening is going to be perfect.If you get the opportunity to visit this club just ENJOY
5
Visited China Club restaurant & was blown away by the views of Singapore, the windows are floor to ceiling & you get a panoramic view, well worthy trying for the view alone. We had approx. 9 or 10 courses of food all were excellent a mixture of fish, meat & vej & I could not fault it. Hope to return one da
4
Good for business lunch.. Good view from high above the CBD. Nice service, good food.. Reasonable price. But you have to be a member or accompanied by one
3
Went for business dinner. Great views all around food just ok and service too. Had steamed fish , prawns, noodles nice ambience but too many lifts to get to the view would skip this
4
Had a really good experience
Food was very good , and service was excellent
An amazing view of Singapore
Nice private rooms
4
Great view of Singapore port and the food is properly Chinese. If you are there on a clear day the view will be an excellent complement to the meal. A good place to host dinner for customers or guests.
4
The club is private but used for corporate entertainment. It offers traditional Chinese food, unhurried as is the norm. The setting feels very authentic and traditional. The excellent views from the restaurant add to the setting. A great location for a special, private meal.
5
Visited this place for a company event a month ago and a friend's wedding 2 years back.The club took great effort to maintain their services and quality of food.Nothing much was changed, food is still as good and it is still one of the top choices for business meetings or events.The sunset view is incredibly alluring in the evening, a place to impress your guests if you are holding an event there
5
This is one high class place that lived up to expectation. The food was good, service was good and it offers a nice view too!We had dim sum in the restaurant and then moved to the bar for coffee and cake. Service was impeccable at both restaurants. Really nice!
4
The China Club - We enjoyed the breakfast with a great view of Singapore.Most of the dim sum dishes come in individual pieces. Order 2 pcs and get 50% off. Was worth the price just for the awesome view! Great start to a superb day!!
4
Nice Ambience and nice venue for wedding. Awesome authentic Chinese cuisine, very beautiful overview
5
Quite amazing food, the Peking duck is succulent and stands comparison with the best, dim sum amazing; a very Chinese cultural setting despite being at the top of a tower - enjoyed the friendly but non obtrusive service; refreshing Chinese teas ....and the vie
5
Invited here for a private business function. Located on the 52nd floor with utterly stunning all round views of Singapore.The service, decoration and atmosphere are excellent. Started with a great mojito and then a really nice 7 course meal in a private dining room. The views are superb and all the more special for being ones that you can't access from a public viewing deck
4
I had a biz lunch at China Club and was pleased by the service and traditional Chinese delights on offer. We had a private room with a great view out to sea though the decoration all around the restaurant is of a high quality. I liked the dark wood effect and detailed carvings with views all around even for those not dining in private rooms. Recommended for entertaining clients and guests
