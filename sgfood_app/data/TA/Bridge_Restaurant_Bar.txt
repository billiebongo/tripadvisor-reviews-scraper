I made the reservation for Thurs evening 7.45pm. Restaurant website and Chope both said it was open but when we showed up- the restaurant was closed. We tried calling but no one picked up either. Not sure what is going on.

A lot of room for improvement on the food
What I like is their artisan bread, amuse bouche and sashimi of tuna + seaweed floss 3.8/5
Main course: the plating does not looks appetising, taste wise 2/5
Dessert: Texture of sesame 2/5

This cozy restaurant located on 31 Seah street is a good find. Food fusion at its best. I great place to have a lunch or dinner celebration. A great place to unwind.

The portions are rather small and dishes were not impressive. We ordered the steak, it was A5 grade, which is known for the fat of the beef which is supposed to add to the flavor of the beef. Unfortunately the fat was not marbled into the meat, so it came across as fats. The risotto was rather tasty.

Me and 2 other friends pass by Bridge. One of their staff mentioned that the set menu was new. So we decided to give it a try. I had the 3 courses and my friends had the 2 courses. Both my friends and i were really impressed by the level of service provided as well as the quality and presentation of the food. The poach Salmon is a must try! Amazing experience! Thank you Yan and Leslie for the excellent service. We will definitely be back

We enjoyed the food at Bridge, which was quite well balanced. All brunch dishes come with the same side of salad (maybe a bit boring?). Unfortunately, the artichoke was not available, although nobody told us when we were ordering. The dishes were not really filling (only if you have the truffle fries as a side order

Had dinner at bridge a few days ago with my partner. Service is excellent. Food is excellent. Ambience is excellent. Had a bottle of Pouilly-fume at a very cheap price. Kudos to the chefs and both the manager for such a wonderful dinner. Kudos to the sommelier whom did such a wonderful wine list. ( cheap and good selection) It never easy to do a small wine list and the sommelier did a very good job. One of the best restaurants and wine list in Singapore.

Atmosphere was relaxing for a weekend couple dinner and made better with awesome fusion cuisine served by friendly staff. From the details displayed on the plate, one would be able to tell that the chief had put in lots of effort to create every single dishes. It was my first taste of fusion cuisine and I enjoyed it at a reasonable cost all thanks to Bridge. Highly recommend for those who enjoys fusion cuisine.

Came here recently for a few beers - attracted by the Hoegarden pints for just $10++. It's more of a cafe than a bar, but at these prices it's pretty good value and seems to be open reasonably late at night.

Tried out the new menu and ordered a couple of the appetizers and most of the main dishes for a family dinner.Food is well presented, tastes great. Notable items on the menu are the backfin crab with passion fruit, squid ink risotto and the A5 wagyu beef. Rounding off the night with desserts which are well balanced with the right amount of sweetness.Overall a pleasant experience

Went for a Saturday dinner with myFiancÃ©, placed started out to be quiet and peaceful but ambience quickly changed to rowdy and loud after a table of 6 joined in.Ordered the foie gras, snapper and ink risotto. Snapper was undercooked and when we brought the attention to one of the server, he put us on hold, continued taking orders from another table, without asking another lady server who's just standing around to attend to us right away. After waiting, he just took away my plate without an apology. Later, chef walked out to present food to other patrons, he saw me and didn't came over with an apology or "we are preparing the dish right now for you, sorry for this". I mean, isn't it normal for the restaurant to apologize first for serving undercooked food? Granted, after I finished my dish, the chef walked over and made small chat but still no apology. Though the dish was done well the second time, the whole lack of attentiveness, the fact that our dishes were not brought out and enjoyed at the same time left a bad impression on me.

I've been to Bridge for dinner twice now. If I'd rated it on the first experience alone it would have been 4/5. On my first visit the food was excellent but the service brought the overall experienced down. The server was an older gentleman who was not particularly friendly and or attentive, and we felt like we were inconveniencing him throughout the night. However, the food made up for it. The butternut squash soup was very tasty and the lamb chops with fregola sarda were excellent, the lamb cooked perfectly and complimented beautifully by the smoked pumpkin puree and other sides. The dark passion chocolate dessert was a chocolate lover's dream for sure. The honey truffle butter that came with the complimentary bread course was also fantastic, a nice change from regular salted butter (which was also served).My second visit was 5/5 in its entirety. We had a couple of different servers who were very friendly and attentively filled our water glasses and checked on our meal throughout. Another gentleman, I believe he was a manager of sorts, was also very friendly and chatted with me about the preparation of the pork dish that I ordered for my main course. The food was standout yet again. I had the truffle mushroom risotto as a starter (it would make a small portion for a main course in my opinion) which was cooked perfectly with a beautiful truffle flavour, very rich and satisfying. The pork belly and cheek dish I had for my main was divine, the best pork belly I've had by far. Meltingly tender and beautifully complimented with the orange sauce. Overall the food has been consistently excellent on both visits, and the service was much improved the second time

I visited with a group of 8 friends on a Friday night and unfortunately our experience fell short because they were so understaffed. Apparently one of their 2 chefs was sick and it happened to be one of their busiest nights. We got some sides. Only two stood out: the wings and the sauce that came with the shoe string fries! The sauce was like a super yummy garlic mayo sauce. So yum. I started dipping everything with it. We ordered scallops, foie gras and octopus cold plate thingy. They were all pretty solid. Amazing plating. Then came to mains... 3 of us ordered the lamb but mine came first and the rest came an hour later. While I was chomping on my lamb, the waiter came out and started serving bread very randomly. I thought that was weird? Maybe they could tell the rest of my friends are hungry. My soup came right at the end..... Haha odd sequence hey? Overall, it's not the best experience but I was with the best kind of company hence it really helped. But it wasn't nice to eat without my friends. They did compensate us with ice cream but Yknow, could have done better from the start. Another thing that quite bugged me was that there were 3 people working there that stood out because they weren't wearing all black (unlike their wait staff) but when we ask them for more info, they always have to check with somebody. It just didn't seem very cool. I might go back to check out their brunch menu. I do think they serve good food but their service can be better.

I can only comment on the salted egg yolk croissant I tried. I was expecting the filling to be smoother and sweeter but it turned out a bit lumpy and saltier. Though that may not be a bad thing. Hopefully, "lumpy" means they use real salted egg yolk (instead of just egg powder) and salty means they didn't overdo the sugar. I guess I was expecting the kind of filling you would find in "lau sar pau" at dim sum restaurants but different isn't a bad thing. At $5.90, it's definitely expensive, but give it a try and you can decide if it's worth it.

A last weekend brunch with friends exploring different places. Finding the way aimlessly under the scorching sun and finally found the cafe / restaurant with the help of google map. It is just beside Raffles Hotel.Settled down and order 3 different dishes and it was pretty good with the relaxing surrounding. The food is pretty good on the buds but a little pricey, but if you want to try something different it is quite worthwhile.CheersJazly

I was looking for a place to go for Sunday brunch so I looked up this restaurant. I liked what I saw and decided to make an online reservation. It also does help when the menu is made available on its website.Getting there was not difficult as it is located opposite the side of Raffles Hotel. It was past 11am (my reservation time) when I peered in and realized thankfully that the restaurant was not full. Inside, the ambiance was warm and cosy. Wooden furnishings are used throughout the restaurant. A chalk board behind our table displayed the ongoing promotions. The cuisine is western and the price reasonable for the portions. Water was not served readily, so we had to ask. I asked for an alternative to the salad on my dish but was subtly told to stick with it. I relented nonetheless, but did not consume the salad in the end. What a waste! I would have finished the alternative. Apart from that one glitch, everything else was alright

I like the restaurant a lot for its unique name. it is special and takes care of all customers well. Its food is so gd that I yearn for it all day long. Sometimes at work I think about this restaurant all the time.

Another overrated restaurant.. went there for dinner, ordered the pan seared scallops and another dish, couldnt even remember what i had because its nothing fantastic..
the place is pretty noisy too
5
We had lunch here the other day and it was really great. The place looks great with its industrial look, service is done with a big smile and the food was delicious. A little gem in Singapore I would recommend to go have lunch!

Good: Stewed beef cheeks were good. Rich, winey, glaze.Salmon went well with grapefruit/citrus Bad:Menu said truffle mash. I got boiled potatoes - half were under-cooked and still crunchy =(Menu said baguette, I got a tiny salad. =(Salmon was over cooked and tough on the underside (though the thickest parts were still moist.)Deserts took too long (at 60% full) to come out and did not come out at the same time (we finished one and the other one was still being prepared!)Brioche French toast bread was not very good and BURNT! (see photos)Staff not trained. Customers not able to substitute drinks (I want water not coffee based drink) BUT they can substitute menu items without prior notice.No service recovery was offered in-spite of my direct feedback either. Guess they decided to ignore itWILL PROBABLY NOT RETURN

This restaurant has a new chef who joined them a few months ago, who has worked at Joel Robuchon at RWS, Corner House and Jaan. I came by for lunch recently and here are the highlights of our meal:- Fresh Baguette: Baked inhouse. This was complimentary served with unsalted butter with sea salt and truffle honey butter. The unsalted butter tastes ordinary until you add a little salt and the flavour comes out. The truffle honey butter was good and it was gone in no time. - Heirloom Tomato Mozarella: $16. Nice presentation. 8 types of seasonal tomatoes cut into wedges and nicely arranged to form an art piece. There’s also mozzarella. The chef also makes caviaroli, which looks like red and white sago balls that are made of tomato and olive oil respectively. Bite into them and it pops. Also loved the tomato powder, olive powder and kalamata olive emulsion, all made in-house.- Foie Gras: $18. Good sized foie gras, pan-seared and topped with candied hazelnut. The orange puree is unique. There’s also burnt orange and grapefruit around the plate, along with balsamic reduction and chilli padi powder to give that kick to your taste buds.- Blue Cod: $29. Hardly find this in Singapore restaurants. You get mostly black cod. The wild-caught NZ Blue cod is fileted and pan fried with scales on. So it was interesting to cut into the fish and then eat it. The scales were crispy and crunchy. Served with savoy cabbage (which is really good), Spanish seaweed, yuzu bouillon (yuzu sago-like balls). - Boston Lobster: $48. This is the star dish for the meal. 56 degree sous-vide lobster that’s de-shelled and nicely plated around the kombu coucous with chopped squid and asparagus. It’s garnished with squid ink foam and extra virgin olive oil. Loved the squid ink foam which has a nice flavour.- Truffle Chicken: $26. Organic-fed chicken breast that’s sou-vide and pan fried before serving. The meat is moist and tender. Its served with barley infused with TWG Earl Grey tea, sabaco, eryngil mushrooms and topped with shavings of black truffle. Also lovely was the egg yolk jelly that’s plated on the side. Tastes really good.- Deconstructed Cheesecake: $14. It looks like an upside down bowl of custard. At the bottom is salted caramel ice cream, raspberry patrfait, topped with lemon cream cheese foam. Its dressed with homemade raspberry jam and topped with meringue drizzled with passionfruit puree. Its nice. We enjoyed the meal very much and I look forward to coming over the weekend to try their Brunch menu, which have items such as Croissant with Boston Lobster!After my lunch, I spotted something behind the bar - Yamazaki 18 Year Old Single Malt Whisky! The restaurant doesn’t sell by bottle but by the glass. Now I know I will be back here soon enough to get my fix of this

Located opposite Raffles Hotel, amongst a row of trendy restaurants and bars, is a lovely chillout spot named Bridge Cafe / Restaurant & Bar, serving modern European dishes and drinks - cafe by day and restaurant by night.I had the Teajito (SGD$18.00), tea-infused rum, mint leaves, lime wedges and simple syrup. Being a Mojito-lover, I liked this drink enough for the flavour; it was a little lighter on the rum, but tea's delicate tones lingered beautifully, making for a unique and exotic drink.I had the Lobster Croissant (SGD$36.00) - lobster, scrambled eggs, baby spinach, bacon, Mesclun and truffle honey vinaigrette. There were huge pieces of bouncy, luscious lobster that were rather well-flavoured, topped with crispy bacon and lightly-sweetened scrambled eggs that filled the palate deliciously. Every morsel was a blend of rich flavours that unfortunately fought with each other to clamor for the most impressionable bite. So the verdict is, delicious, but perhaps the bacon could be replaced with something else that complements the lobster instead of clashing with it in flavour. Also, loved the delicious dollop of mayonnaise on the side.Dessert was Creme Brulee (SGD$9.00), a gorgeous tub of ingredients served on a wooden board. Sitting on top of the delicate caramel-sugar coat is a scoop of vanilla (bean?) ice-cream, and wedges of fruits including grapefruits! Cracking apart the caramel coating reveals milky pudding that was light as a dream. It was a very satisfying dessert, a very different creme brulee with its addition of ice-cream and fruits, adding a touch of citrusy balance to its ambrosial taste.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/07/brunch-at-bridge-cafe-restaurant-bar.htm

On a quiet street lined with restaurants and bars with music and smoke, there's a place with an eclectic mix of chairs, some textural interest in the wall finishes and a tremendous combination of service and brilliance.The warm welcome from the wait staff was just lovely. The bar man is a genius. His cocktails are lovely to look at and taste even better. We're happy and we hadn't even got to the food!So, the menu is short, perhaps 'focused' is the better word. We both order the waygu steak medium. Our liquid art pieces arrive and are admired and quickly demolished, they're delicious. And then the steak arrives. It's a work of art on a plate. I NEVER want to photograph my food but tonight was an exception. Its sensational, beautifully tender, flavoursome, curious pieces on the plate which are yum.Then we move on to dessert. We decide to order both the deconstructed cheesecake and the Creme brûlée, and share. And they're amazing. Just wonderful and creatively different but truly beautifully cooked food.And that's the best bit. The food was simply great. The service was great. The drinks were great. We eat out a lot and have no patience for substandard fare. So imagine our surprise at stumbling into this terrific place. It's great. Really. Please go there and enjoy

Reserved a table for Saturday morning brunch with friends, and they didn't exactly leave a great first impression. Brunch is supposed to start at 11am, but the restaurant called to tell us the earliest table available is 11.15am. I can only imagine the 15 minutes delay is for the employees of the restaurant to set the tables and prepare for customers. Shouldn't a good restaurant prepare before their stated opening hours already?Anyway, arrived at this place, and I quite liked the brunch menu. We ordered some coffees which were served quickly enough, and the coffee here is really good. But the food was a different story, because it took quite a while to be served. To be fair, however, I assume the cooks were still in a Saturday morning-trance for their first orders of the day, because my friend who arrived later, got his food served in a more reasonable time frame. Food is not bad, but the serving not quite adequate, especially if you're a guy. One of my friends had the full breakfast while I had the salmon scramble, and they were tasty. But one of my guy friends barely felt full after his meal, and had to order for an additional side of truffle fries. That said, the truffle fries weren't fantastic. The fries were somewhat salty, and I barely tasted any hint of truffle in them. The atmosphere of the place is nice though, and we stayed for some time catching up, in their comfortable environment.Overall, while the place is nice, the food is overpriced -- both for its quantity and quality. It's a saving grace that the coffee here is good

Came here today for lunch and opted for the 3 course menu at $25. Caesar salad for starter was quite decent, fish and chips for main was average, and the dessert was quite ok. Service was good. Not bad value at the price, although I think I prefer some of the other places in the vicinity

Good things about Bridge - it's a new, interesting, relaxed environment and the food is very good. There is a nice touch of creative flair in the dishes and in the execution of them.What's not so good about Bridge? - It is as if the restaurant doesn't really know what it is. The decor is simple, almost minimalist bistro with a hint of trendy New York loft. The wait staff are relaxed (possibly too relaxed) and seem to be unfamiliar with the menu and with generally good service. They are friendly enough (although there was only a barman and one table waiter in the evening we visited) but they seem quite 'unpolished'. For example, our waiter had to be reminded about a drink we had ordered and main dishes - we had two diners eating the lamb and one eating the pork - came at crazy intervals with no explanation for the delay. We also had a lovely starter - seared scallops - which was served with a delicious crunchy pesto crust. Scallops were sweet and cooked just right with a juicy centre and no hint of toughness. Unlike the main course, the starters came to the table at the same time. After quite a lengthy delay (there were only three other tables occupied when we were there) the pork dish arrived. This was mine and I was quite hungry so I started before the dish got cold. I had almost finished eating by the time the two beautifully presented paltters arrived with the lamb.No complaints about the quality of food - lamb was pink and tender and the pork was delightfully tender - but, oh dear, what shambolic service to the table.The other issue was cost. On the menu the items seem quite competitively priced but the actual amount on the plate is more on the minimalist side. For the amount paid (well over $100 for three with drinks on top) it seemed disappointing overall.There is much going for Bridge which, I believe, is quite a new restaurant down at Seah Street. Sadly, I cannot see long term survival unless better service protocols are introduced soon. This is an area where the competition is quite fierce (Raffles Hotel with its many F&B offerings is just across the street) and the 'big boys' have the resources and manpower to overwhelm the new kid on the block.Overall, happy with the gastronomy but disappointed by the rest
