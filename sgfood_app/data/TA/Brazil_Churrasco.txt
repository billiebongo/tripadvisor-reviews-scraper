The Brazil Churrasco is by far the best churascaria in town. We love to eat there! If you enjoy meat this is the place to be!

Me and my family often come here and this time i brought my Nephew and kids. Had a good time. Fresh cut of meats and very gd Service. There is a Valet Service as well and i do advise to use it as parking is minimal around there. Priced Reasonably and from all the Churrasco out there. This Restaurant is tge best of them all. Highly recommend it

This place is the best Brazilian buffet style place I've ever been anywhere in my life. I may actually go so far to say it's one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. The food is incredible, I don't know what they do to their meat, but it's indescribably tasty. Similarly, the server lads are super, super friendly, and I particularly love the one guy who is always grinning slyly everytime he tempts you into taking some extra beef or whatever, with his wonderfully encouraging, devil on the shoulder demeanor. I honestly can't speak highly enough about this place. I've been here so many times, with so many large groups of people, every single one of whom loves the place. It therefore actually angers me reading the negative reviews that are on here. It's a nonsense, this place is absolutely wonderful and you should go

Well I heard much about Brazilian food this evening friends wanted to take there son out for his birthday. Must admit as a meat eater from Louisiana it was not something I really really enjoyed. Would I eat here again? Only if friends wanted to come.

Visited this place with family for dinner buffet for S$50 each. The way it works is that you help yourself from the salad buffet which is good but not too exciting. Then the waiters come to you with different meats on large skewers and slice off pieces onto your plate. They bring tons of smoked duck, fish, chicken, a variety of beef and pork. All the meat items I have tried were really good. They also serve flambed pineapple, sliced off the skewer just like the meat - it's also very good, especially to finish off your dinner. Service was great and very friendly

For those of us who have had Churrasco at restaurants a little closer to Latin America, the seasoning and preparation may seem a little off. However, it’s a genuine experience and the meat tender and flavorful. What takes it to a full 5 stars is the value, the service (best we’ve gotten in Singapore thus far) and a bonus for us in that, per the restaurant staff, the chicken and beef are halal (the restaurant itself is not as it serves pork, but if you inform them in advance, they won’t offer it at your table)

Have visited this restaurant since 2002 every year on an average of about 5 times a year. I think the record is ten times a year in one or two of those 15 years. Why do I keep coming back? The food is excellent, that is always important, but to me, especially through aging where I cannot eat as much as I used to, the staff are equally important. The staff treat you like friends instead of customers, and there is genuine warmth in them wanting to ensure you have the best possible experience. They get to know you and they often recognise repeat customers and great them like buddies. This is the restaurant which I often use to host friends as it has fantastic ambiance. They opened a branch at Gilman Barracks a few years back but that didn't work out. I have also tried other restaurants with this same concept but they don't measure up. So it will be, for many more years, me being back at The Original Brazil Churrasco at Sixth Avenue, because it is the best

I have reviewed before and nothing has changed except perhaps got better. Fabulous Salad Bar, far more choices than usual. Staff are so very friendly (They need to be, their knives are so sharp!). The meat! Oh the meat! Here is not a suitable place for a vegan. Comes out on spits carved directly onto your plate and it keeps on arriving. Beef Lamb Chicken etc etc if you like meat you will most certainly enjoy, combine it with a selection of their very excellent wine.My tip: Do not eat anything for a least 12 hours prior

Treated my husband to dinner at the restaurant. Service was excellent. Salad bar was well stocked and food was good. I like the beef short ribs and grilled chicken especially. The waiters also sang a birthday song in Portuguese for us. It was a great experience

This restaurant is popular with local crowds and serve WESTERN food. The salad is BUFFET style, whereby clients choose the selections of veg from a round section os serving table. The quality of the greens is good and the choice acceptable. The dinners will be offered a small cup of soup of the day. The main course are mainly MEAT (CHICKEN, LAMB, PORK, BEEF, CHICKEN LIVER....) being served via waiters. The serving is repeated, and clients can eat as much as they want. The quality of the meat is acceptable. The wine list is acceptable for normal dinning. Service is good. Seating arrangement is a bit crowded; as the restaurant has limited space. Prices is acceptable. Location is slightly out of the city, but can easily reached by most type of transport. A good place for a mid range meal
4
The location of Brazil Churrasco is a little far if you're staying on Orchard but it is well worth the cab ride, not so easy to get a ride back though. The staff seated us very quickly. The restaurant is very clean and not too noisy for the amount of waiters serving. There is a great salad bar but don't eat too much because there are so many meats to choose from. Don't miss the Caipirinha cocktail. Putting it all together; the ambiance, the staff, the delicious food we will definitely return
4
The meat is cooked beautifully and with fatty, lean, spiced, plain all available,so depending on your palette, there is something there for you.The only disappointment is the salad bar, it was a little like 'why bother' as the offerings looked as though they had been done under sufferance and with no real effort....they were just as they looked to eat as well!however meat is the star and that was brilliant...highly recommend it
5
We've been visiting these places from Brazil to Dubai and everything in between, so our expectations are usually high. This place was very good. Service was good, the buffet was good, but not too good, so you could really enjoy the meat. Service pacing was ok, a bit fast, but again not too fast. They dont provide red/green tags, so everything is offered, but it didnt get pushy. Quality of the meats was exellent. From chicken to Picanja it was cooked to perfection. Price is desent, compared to the quality of the foods and service its cheap! High reconmendation for everybody familiar with the concept.
5
As good or better than any I have been to in South America. Huge salad bar and so so much meat how on earth anyone manages the complimentary ice cream for desert is beyond me. Make sure you are hungry before you go. Worth to visit. Sin $15 from downtown by taxi
3
Servers were quick to fill your plate, and they were polite and professional, but it seems to me as they were being polite and professional for the sake of it. With regards to the food, except for the chicken and fish which i find it ok, the rest of the food seemed a bit salty. Even the mushroom soup tasted salty and the cup that holds it is only as big as a wine cup. I have been to neighbourhood western food restaurants and their soup is a lot much nicer then that. I have not tasted brazilian cuisine before, so i am not sure are they really supposed to be a lot more saltier?The salad, however, was a 5/5 for me which is why i rated food at 4. They have rice, fruits, Fries a lot more and overall, in comparison to other buffets i have been, the salad offering is definitely on par with some of the good buffets i have been. The place was filled with 90+% capacity, ambience is ok and if you would like to celebrate birthdays and stuff like that, i guess its fine provided the price range is ok for you. I do think the price is more on the expensive side though, like low high range
5
We arrived very much earlier than our reservation had stated, but the manager welcomed us with open arms. The buffet of salads was a very pleasant surprise, and is bound to please any vegetable lover! The variety of meats was also another pleasant surprise, and the waiter who explained how things worked and the several meat cutters were very friendly and patient when interacting with a first-time customer like me. Just a little note - one should definitely visit this place with a very empty stomach... there are up to 14 types of salad and 10 types of meat waiting to be savoured. This is definitely a place worth returning to

Authentic Brazilian churrascaria in Singapore - great food and great service. Welcomed by a lady staffmember and promptly seated. Went for the $49 all you can eat deal. The buffet has typical Brazilian dishes like aipim frito (fried manioc/cassava) and palmito (hearts of palm, nicely grilled instead of cold). Farofa, feijoada, and caldinho available upon request. Then the meats started coming, including the star cut - the picanha, perfectly salted and grilled Brazilian style with a nice, smoky aroma. There is a reason why churrasco in Brasil is the paixao nacional, national passion because there is an art to grilling the meat, turning it to achieve the perfect temperature. Other cuts were equally delicious - maminha/alcatra, costelinha de boi (beef shortrib), picanha com alho (picanha laced with garlic), coracao/chicken hearts, etc. Pao de queijo was served on the table and two sauces - vinagrete and a sweet mint sauce (presumably for diners who prefer it for their lamb). They even have Guarana Antartica! Excellent service by the passadores/staff including the carioca Brazilian gentleman. The music coming through the soundsystem started off with Spanish guitar instrumentals (including a version of Manolo Escobar's Y Viva Espana) when they first started the dinner service, gradualling changing to Brazilian music including bossa nova (we heard Agua de Beber). Highly recommended, o sabor do Brasil em Cingapura, the taste of Brazil in Singapore - imperdivel - not to be missed - as they say in Brasi

Was in Singapore to watch "Air" in concert on Esplanade with wifey. But we decided to go couple of days earlier and have some Singaporean dishes. Had an idea to have a nice "meaty" dinner, so we browsed the internet and found this "Brazil Churrasco" place.First I tought it's a little expensive for a dinner... but when I sat down they just wont stop delivering great food to the table. From Beef Tenderloin, Brisket, to Roast Duck, in total 14 dishes if Im not mistaken. Great Food!Loved the Tenderloin, Lamb Shoulder, Roast Duck, Chicken Liver, my wife was crazy about their Pinnaple Roast.Staff was amazing, service was on point, ambience is very nice it's not to stiff like fine and dine spot, but it's not crowded like food court.It doesn't end there, we had a smoke outside to let the food digest, since it's a LOT of food we ate. So the owner "Martin" was smoking outside too, we had a nice chat.......And our night ended with Martin took us to an authentic Singaporean Bar down at Far East Plaza. Cool guy

We've been to this place several times over the past 11 years. It's probably the longest surviving and best Brazailian style churrascarria restaurant in Singapore. It's still reasonable value by local standards (the all the meat you can eat buffet is S$49), and they will overwhelm you with meat while you're there. The service standards are really good by local standards. The staff are friendly and very attentive. That's the good part. So what's the downside?1. Drinks are starting to get pricey. The Caipirinhas (about S$15 each) seem to have shrunk a bit, and the glass seems to have far too much ice in it. They don't seem as potent as they used to be either (in the olden days back in 2006 two of these would almost knock out the average Singaporean). Still nice, bit not as epically great as they once were.2. Over-emphasis on less expensive cuts of beef (still nice topside). They only brought us tendeloin/fillet once towards the end of our meal. I don't recall any pork being offered even once. 3. The desert helpings are tiny for the (high) price and they are not included in the buffet. So, by Singapore standards, I can still rate Brazil Chuuascaro as "Very Good" whereas in the past it was "Excellent". The service is still excellent, but the food and drink while still acceptable have declined.Top Tips:Don't pay for valet parking. Park across the street in the underground car park beneath Guthrie House. Don't bother with the desserts. Expensive drinks
5
Was warmly welcomed when arrived, amazing food salad bar was good but the meat is the main and it was delicious. The wonderful staff are super attentive and always make you feel you're in a Brazilian atmosphere.
Will definitely come back and recommend.

Such fantastic service, so well explained and looked after. It was really impressive.
Food was GREAT! A lot of food..... but the variety was awesome.

My partner loves meat, so for his birthday, I thought of bringing him for Churrasco. At first I made a reservation at another Churrascaria restaurant in town, which I've been to a few times. Yet after reading up on handfuls of average or poor reviews of them on this website, I found Brazil Churrasco and visited for the first time this evening! True to what others have said about the wonderful service, most of the service staff and passadores were friendly and smiley. One lady staff, Maya, who got us seated was very attentive to us. After knowing that it was our first visit to the restaurant, she gave us an introduction to the menu and the extensive salad bar. When I checked the salad bar out, she was there to point out highly recommended dishes and what Brazilians usually have (Garlic rice and beans) I'm just an ordinary guest, but her service made me feel very special. Other Passadores were also very personable. When I told one of them I was saving my stomach for medium rare meat, it came out almost instantly. When I nodded to one of the server's question about having more pineapples, it came in a snap. These people work very efficiently in a team, even though they do not seem to exchange much words with one another. Tikki, a cheery Brazilian passadore, brimmed with pride when we asked him how long he had been working with the restaurant. "22 years!" he chuckled as he went on to serve other guests, flashing his two rows of white teeth all the while. Aeson, a filipino passadore, also chatted with us like old friends.The salad bar has an extensive range of vegetables from broccoli to fritters. My favourite is the fried kai lan, garlic rice and beans and the banana fritters. Additionally, the cheese balls were PHENOMENAL and so were the glazed pineapples . A myriad of meats were served- chooks, beef, duck, pork sausages and ham. I'm no rotisseri connoisseur but i found the roasts to be well-salted and nicely done. Beef is my favourite and it was sensational. To end off the scrumptious meal, we had lava cake. The vanilla ice-cream was very good and so was the moist chocolate cake.From the service, to the variety and quality, this place makes every dollar worthwhile. Thanks guys, I'll definitely come back! :D We went there on a Tuesday evening

I have been to many churrascarias, both in Brazil as well as in the US and in Singapore. This place is the best one in Singapore and beats Carnivore hands down. The meats are fresher and better tasting and the service is great. The caipirinhas were nice and the salad buffet had enough variety to complement the several meats that the servers brought to our table
3
I'll start if by saying the service was really good. The majority of the meat however is just average, and over salted. Perhaps coming from a part of the world where the meat is of high quality my expectations were too high. The pork/ham came off a round processed roll not leg ham. Poor quality cuts of lamb and beef except the beef rib which was good and tenderloin was ok. Chicken was 90% bone and the fish was almost inedible. We have been to many Brazilian BBQs joints around the world and this falls well short unfortunately. Not bad just not great. Harsh but fair
4
If you like your meat and visit or life in Singapore, this is a must visit. They have a nice salad buffet. And the servers come ate your table with big pieces of meat and slice parts directly on your plate so you get juicy meat. Think of pork, sirloin, chicken, lamb and so on. The sugar pineapple is nice ending to a great meal
4
This is a restaurant I can strongly recommend. The service, the atmosphere and of course the food. Excellent all of it. The price is what to expect, average Singapore.It's a bit far away from Orchard road and Clark key, but there is a few taxis in Singapore, so that is a minor problem. The only thing you shoud be aware of, do not go into the " salat bar " trap. Bon apetit
5
I went with my family of four after we had been recommended by my father's friend. A lovely ambience. Staffs were friendly. Excellent service. Location is a little far from Orchard Road. There were a variety of meat and were delicious. But, pork hams were okay and chicken livers tasted weird. The little cheese balls were great as well! Will definitely visit more! :
4
Located In 14/16 - 6th Ave - about 10 min from Orchard by Taxi (only 7 to 8 USD)Nice simple restaurant with a buffet style menu - take the salad from the salad bar as well as the potatoes etc.served is a small vegetable soup - very tasty (can have second one without extra charge), thereafter the waiters pass by frequently with all kinds of BBQ meat - Lamb, Chicken, Beef, Pork all in various varieties.Actually it is impossible to leave without having enough.No fresh fruit juice available, nice desserts like chocolate lava cake or banana with ice cream. The waiters are very friendly and serving with much attention.Prices are reasonable Can warmly recommend this restaurant - the food is really tasty
5
The meat cuts are great choice and the salad bar with great selection of healthy food.Ever smiling staffs that alway make me and my group feel right at home.A place you wanna be to enjoy the meal and friend
4
Everybody knows Brazil Churrasco is one of the better Churrasco restaurants in Singapore. I would only like to suggest they train their servers to treat everyone of different races equally.
5
Located away from touri hotspots, at 6th Avenue, we found our place for meet!For many years, Brazil was and is a must!Fresh beautiful food, high quality, thats it.Friendly staff is providing perfect service and let the guests enjoy the stay.So do not try others, go there..

Being from southern Brazil I have had BBQ almost at least twice a month over my lifetime. Tell you: This is the closest to the real thing you'll get in Singapore. The variety of beef isn't what you should look for. The quality of what they offer is the the big attraction. My favourite is the hump, which is better than in most Brazilian places. The black beans (Brazilian staple) are also phenomenal. Courtesy of the resident Brazilian BBQ master and the lovely team that makes everyone feel welcome

First time I have been to this restaurant for a long time and I was not disappointed. Service was good the food kept coming. Meat was very good and the house wine reasonably priced at S$55. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you want to have a meat feast. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3.

If you are a meat lover like me, look no further... skewers of meat cooked to perfection. Well seasoned, char grilled and yet medium rare... Super scrumptious! My fave dishes include Topside, Rump steak, Garlic beef and chicken hearts! For a fixed price, you can have as much meats as you can handle plus a good buffet spread of salads and sides!Save room for dessert, which for me is the grilled pineapples! So sweet and so good
4
Generally it's a decent experience for the price. Obviously they start with a big piece of chicken first (you can't take a small piece, so it's best to pass). The beef comes later - they have five different types of beef, and it's best to take as much as you can as it won't come back. While they have to turn a profit, it would be polite for the beef to come back some of the time. Perhaps I was disappointed because I had high expectations but I have tasted better outside Singapore. There's a good salad bar though. The low ceiling makes it deafening when the restaurant is full
5
My whole family has been a regular here at Brazil Churrascaria since 2009. Everytime we have birthdays or overseas guests, we bring them here. From then until now, this is still our favorite! We did try other churrascarias but they're not even as close as this. Even our American friends agree this is one of the best churrascaria they've ever tasted. Selections at the salad bar are HUGE, it can satisfy both Western & Asian tastes. Try the banana fritters, Mango salad, fried baby spinach & other spicy mixed veggies which we never found somewhere else. Beware though: the sald bar can fill up your stomach before the meats come! Picanha is still our favorite from the meat selections, but the chicken heart, garlic beef, smoked duck & tenderloins are AWESOME too! Keep up the good work
4
Sixth Avenue Singapore isn't exactly where I'd have expected to see a Brazilian Churrascaria, but there it is and has been there for over 20 years (apparently). It's not quite São Paulo's "Fogo di Chão" but it does a great job of bringing out course after course of succulent meats, carved from the skewer, straight onto your plate. And having taken a vegetarian with us (I know, right!!) she was pleasantly surprised to find a lavishly stocked salad bar, overflowing with nice little surprises like seafood of varying types. It's not fine dining, but for a great night out with friends and a very enjoyable meal, we'll be going again.
5
I always find that it is one thing for a restaurant to serve amazing food, it's another to keep doing it consistently. My first visit to Brazil Churrasco was 20 years back and my latest yesterday. The consistency in the quality of meat and the standard of cooking is what keeps me coming back. Never fails to disappoint
4
We had dinner with friends at this place, and it is a traditional Churrascaria. I have been to many brazilian restaurants, in Brazil, Mexico, the US and other LA countries. This is the good stuff, it has a salad table where you can balance your meal with vegetables and other kinds of food, on top of the different kind of meat served by the passadores. The only reason it does not have 5 stars is that they do not have all sorts of meat. Don't get me wrong, it is enough and the meat is high quality.We had a great time
5
True Brazilian environment. Great meat, great service and for Singaporean standards fair price. Their Picanha was especially good and so was the caipirinha.
5
2nd trip here and just as good as first. More than enough meat and a very decent salad bar too. Ate far too much! Friendly service. Will be back.
5
need to go if you love meat. nice Brazil restaurant in Singapore. good service. have also a salad bar. and is al you can eat.
5
If all brazillian food tastes this good, I might be missing out in life. With Brazil Churrasco located at Sixth Avenue, it might not be necessary to hop on-board the next flight to Rio. Excellent variety of beef cuts and other choices of meat like chicken and smoked duck. Beef hump was very tender and beef topside was juicy and lightly marinated so you really get to taste the flavor of the cut. This buffet meal is inclusive of a salad bar. Pineapple was lightly seasoned with cinnamon and sugar glazed, very beautiful and enjoyable. Overall fantastic spread
5
No matter how hungry you are or how much you like meat, this place will totally change your perspective about what "too much" means! With about S$40 per person you have unlimited portions of good meat (all possible kinds) and an ala carte buffet with complimentaries. For dinner, try around 6-7 o' clock, it's the best time!
4
I've been coming here since I was 19. It still is the best of its kind of restaurants here in sg. The meats are delectable, the pineapples are always charred just right, and the chicken hearts are little salty charred explosions of flavour in your mouth. The service and excellent and friendly, and their Caprioska are perfectly made. I've been to some of their rival Churrascaria, and although the salad bar pales in comparison cos it's so small (who has salad at these places anyway??!?), everything else is at least 80% better quality. Choose Brazil, nowhere else
5
Yes, of course they have a great range of meats sliced straight from the skewer to your plate (most delicious rump steak, smoked duck, chicken and more). But I was surprised by the quality and range of the salad bar; I could happily dine on that alone.I'm sure I visited many years ago, but it feels as fresh and friendly as ever (seems to have had a good refit/renovation in the meantime). The buffet style makes it any ideal venue for friends or colleagues to meet as you can dispense with all the fuss over menus and ordering and get straight down to enjoying yourselves
5
A lovely night out, the food was simply superb and there was a lot of it. I would go back for the salads alone. Although the meat was superb and definitely the highlight. The service was fantastic, this is after all what makes a great meal a terrific meal and here it is done effortlessly and with a smile. We will be back the next time the carnivore in us needs feeding
5
Having Brazilian friends, we tried all of them in Singapore and this is surely the best and most authentic one. So now we only visit them when in need of real meat and Brazilian food! They have the best tasting saucy meat, so much choice and coming no stop. The buffet area is also very nice and with much variety to chose from. The waiters: I think they're the best in Singapore, so friendly and smiley, they always prepare for me a more "well done" meat when coming to serve it, it feels so nice to be pampered in a restaurant! Thank you guys! The menu has a fixed price and includes the buffet, the meat, some super nice little cheese breads with sauces and a little cup of soup. Don't forget to leave a space in the stomach for their grilled pineapple which is absolutely delicious! Highly recommended
5
+ wide variety of cold and hot salad+ serving up to 10-15 different cuts of meats ranging from beef, pork, chicken, lamb and duck+ don't forget about their barbecue pineapple, a must!!!+ friendly Brazilian passadores (meat waiters) coming up to your table carving sumptuous meat+ request more of your favorite cuts of meat to be serve to you+ don't forget to try one of the classic drinks caipirinha like a true blue Brazilian- limit parking space in front of resturant- don't risk walking in, best to make reservations
5
Very good place to eat a brasilian barbecue. There is a very nice brasilian waiter. I can recomend it.
4
In all I was quite happy, except that most of the meats were quite salty. Considering the price, the quality was quite good. Service fine. Best to try a little of each, then stick with what you like, since several choices are very salty. The fish was excellent
5
Been ages never have churrascaria style of dining. Looking high and low at 6th Ave, actually specially came to Singapore to have brazillian style of meat serving..and we chosed the right restaurant.Salad and side dish bar was full of selection. The meat was fresh,tasty,juicy and you dont hv to add any sauce for themWaiters were helpful,friendly and outstandingly informative.We tried the coconut de manjar dessert as suggested by the waiters..deliciouso...Definitely will come back and really a satisfied journey for happy tumm
5
Everything here is amazing. From the tender meat that comes off the skewer to the huge salad bar. The variety is fantastic and all the meat is seasoned and cooked so well. Always a joy to eat here. The service is really good too and you are never left waiting.
5
The ambience was noise but everyone in a happy mood. Service was very attentive and efficient too, different kind of meat was served one after another in a superb Brazilian flavour juicy & tender yummy we loved the bbq pineapples at the end. Must try Caipirinha & Caipiroska as well. The right place to have a Brazilian atmosphere and original flavour of Brazil. As a Brazilian I strongly recommend this place for meat lovers. We'll come back for more.
4
Visited on Sunday for brunch. They served us on all-you-can-eat basis at $42. Different kind of meat was served one after another and we could not eat them all and told them we are full and we give up... We were not very impressed by the taste of meats but the baked pineapple they served was very special and never experienced before. We lobbed it soooo much and we consider revisit this place just for that! とにかくものすごい量の肉、肉、肉を次々に持ってきてくれます。。それ自体特別美味しいとは感じませんでしたが、焼パイナップルは特筆すべきものでした。大変美味しく、中途半端なスィーツではとても太刀打ちできない素晴らしい美味しさでした。これだけのためにまた行きたいです
5
Friend brought me here. It was great. Beef was juicy n tender. Don't over eat others. Beef is really the best. Roasted pineapple was great to go along. Wine was fine too. Nice place for dinner. Parking was manageable on the weekday.Or u can catch a DTL2 mrt ride
5
This is my 10 times back to old Brazilian cuisine. The meat was so tender and juicy and very tasty. Been away for 2 years and I came back, the taste remain the same, good vibes and most of all, the service, top notch! If you craving for Brazilian meat, go to Brazil Churrascaria at sixth avenue. strongly recommend, is a must. You won't disappointed
5
Family with grandma visited the restaurant. You take veggies at the salad bar and start waiting for the meats to come. And the flow is varied and abundant! All you van eat, but mostly great stuff. Down to earth atmosphere and surroundings, but you are convinced by the great food
5
5th time back here, made a reservation for 4 but in the end only 2 of us turned up. After all these years, the quality of the meats, salad bar and service are still the same if not better. Still my favorite Churrascaria. Missed the fish yesterday though :
5
Booked a table at this place and were definitely not disappointed, food and service as excellent. Pleasant and not too crowded atmosphere.
3
a continuous serving of meat without pause and interval with other taste of food. I had rejection of meat for some days. price expensive
5
The "plot" is simple - eat all you can - all kinds of delicious barbecued meats direct from the skewer.Here you get in in one of the best ways - served by true Brazilians with "smile and style" and all in the best quality, incl. the rich salad bar.I visited this restaurant many years ago and was amazed then.Now again and truly amazed that all of the atmosphere was as I remembered, - nice, cozy, clean, and not least well maintained in all aspects.Needless to say that when you leave you have eaten way too much, when all is served as you will experience here........
5
This place is incredible. Cannot rate it enough! The staff are so helpful, friendly and lovely. Making the experience even better by joking around with us. I've never been to a place like it just wish we had them in the UK! Brilliant!! And so so yummy. Stomach wasn't big enough!!
5
Fantastic food, the service was outstanding the price was unbelievably cheap and the atmosphere was exciting. Just when you think they cannot possibly bring anymore meat out they do. Woweeee what a great way to taste Brazilian food. It was so good we went back a second time with baggy trousers on
5
We had a party of 12 paxCelebrated my grandson"s birthday dinner here as he requested for meats.The Passadors are friendly and the food flow was uninterrupted.The service was excellent, especially Mr. Wong, who took care of all our needs, with a smile all the time.The quality of the meats here are of good quality !Will recommend this place for all meat lovers
5
Meat Meat Meat and more meat and all so very tasty, 13 to 15 different cuts of meat from Brazilian chorisio, to Beef ribs, chicken legs, ham, tenderloin, all so delicately cooked, you have to skip lunch if you have to do justice to this place, the Caiprinha is to die for just amazin
5
Good service, great meat. Done at the true Brazilian style.The cheese bread is also something worth trying.Finish it with a roasted pineapple to help with the digestion
5
Have been going to this restaurant for years and don't why it's taken me so long to write this review. But here I am now...You'll be spoiled for choice at the salad bar, something for everyone. And the meats, (drooling) to die for... melts in your mouth cuts and lots of variety, a nice plus is the smoked duck, which I love. And pineapple.... what can I say, they know I like mine, 'burnish'... so yummy... Have all that with a nice bottle of wine, and you'll be a happy camper... happier if you had their caipirinha :) :)The service there is excellent, staff very friendly. And it's nice to walk in a restaurant and they know your name. For all you meat lovers out there, you have to go there. You will not be disappointed. In my 'humble' opinion, one of the best restaurants in Singapore.  One final note, Welcome back Maya.... so happy that you've come back!!! She's wonderful. Always a smile on her face....

This joint is a meat lovers heaven! Cut after cut of juicy meat being served by fast, friendly staff at a decent price made me a happy customer. The service, being one of the friendliest in Singapore, was an absolute refresher. I have not seen staff this happy at work in a long time!The only negative points I would have to note would be the salad bar (could be worked on a little, didn't really have anything worth going back for second helpings...then again, it is a MEAT focused restaurant) and the parking...which was difficult to find. All in all, a great experience, decently good food with impeccable staff...keep it up guys

A very good restaurant for meat lovers. While the meat selection is not that extensive, what they have is really good. I have enjoyed the smoked duck, lamb chops and lean beef (don't know which cut it was as I didn't get what the servers were saying). I didn't like the beef ribs.The salad bar is extensive. The only negative is that they don't have a separate bowl or plate for the salad. I do not like the hassle of bringing the dinner plate at the buffet spread for a second helping. I also do not like putting heaps on the plate to avoid going back as that is just wasteful. Wine, beer and other drinks cost as much as any other restaurant.All in all, it was a good experience. Will come back again

Recently went to this Brazilian eatery and love the variety of smoked meats they have. They have many different outlets and I like the Sixth Ave one because it's child-friendly. The buffet was pretty wholesome as well. If you have a large family, this is a good place for family style sharing. For couples, it could be a bit overwhelming as it's meat galore all the way.

We went for a Sunday Brunch at Brazil Churrasco, hoping that it would at least resemble the original concept we know from Brazil. The restaurant is a bit out of the way, not near your typical Singapore hang outs but worth the effort to go (it is best to take a taxi, the restaurant will call one for your journey back if you ask). Book in advance as this place is still popular in spite of being some 20 years in business (this alone should tell you something, if it has lasted this long it must be good).The restaurant delivers on all aspects: quick and friendly service, excellent meat selection, good beverage offering. The dÃ©cor is still the same as when they opened, but it is clean and functional, not unlike your typical churrascaria in Brazil. The owners and some of the servers are, you guessed it, Brazilians. And you get Brazilians that go to eat there. A couple of words of advice, so you are not surprised: the food is a flat price of 43 SGD per person and if you go with an appetite, it will be very cheap. But their beverages are expensive, so be warned, even plain water gets charged. Desert is home made, but usually only one selection, as you are expected to come to eat meat, not desert. In addition, you will find what for lack of a better word is an extensive salad bar and if you are into Brazilian food, they make a killer Farofa to go with your meat, in addition to an endless selection of veggies, salads and other dishes to accompany your meat. It is an all you can eat place, so depending on the capacity of your tummy, be wise and concentrate on the meat and yes, have some greens to pacify your conscience but don't over do it, as the grilled meats are delicious. If you are not a carnivore, don't expect a vegetarian menu, although the salad bar has a lot to offer a non meat eating person. Doing a little fasting did wonders for my enjoyment, as I was able to work my way through the entire selection, and one more thing: by all means try some grilled pineapple with your meat, it is a great combination and helps to reduce your sensation of fullness from too much meat

Really amazing spread of salads, up to 30 cold and warm salads. They kept the meats coming, til you say stop. Roasted to perfection and dripping with juice. To prevent the feeling of discomfort of having too much meat, I suggest to pace yourself with a salad here and there. Definitely will go bac

A brazilian gem in singapore. This place got some really good meat going on. And its eat all you want. They got a big buffet for sides (or for vegetarians). you pick what sides you want and sit down. then meat bonanza starts.they have 8-9 different types of meat coming out. Note that they will come to your table as soon as possible after the meat is done to ensure its fresh from the bbq. you may feel stressed that they come before you are done with the last slice but its ok to say "no, come back later". they will not consider it rude and they will just try again later. Just make sure that you dont eat too fast and fill up too quickly. Its plenty of meat going around, all the time. no need to hurry. if you find one type you like just ask for that meat. Note that this place is well outside of the city center so consider taking a cab unless you know the buses well. taxi is cheap in singapore.tldr; make sure you have a whole evening here and take your time!

My rating may not be in true fairness, but I would say that I was a bit disappointed. This was my third visit to the restaurant and while prices has gone up from my previous visit, their services have droppedThe pros1. Continues to be a meat lover's paradise - meat, meat and meat2. A great salad counter3. Nice choice of drinksThe cons1. They serve the meat on the table - this time the service appeared slow. One had to wait a while between two helpings...while munching on salads. Thus you get filled up on greens while expecting the meat to arrive2. A few of us had the feeling of being bloated very quickly suggesting the liberal use of soda bicarb 3. Desserts were overpriced Final judgement : Good for meat lovers - but otherwise not worth the mone
5
Quite a trek from downtown Singapore, it turned out to be well worth the 20 minute taxi ride it took us to get there.Good side dishes aside, this experience is all about the meat. Which was very tasty, and kept on coming, almost faster than we could eat it, brought to the table and carved right onto our plates by the friendly serving staff.The great food was suitably complemented by excellent service, which even included calling a taxi for us when the meal was done. I will definitely try to fit in another visit at this restaurant if I ever travel to Singapore again
4
Hadn't been back for a myriad of reasons. But when we eventually did, our family of four clearly weren't disappointed. Pleasant and professional staff were in attendance and they knew their stuff. Decoration looks the same as when i was last there a decade ago and it can probably do with some sprucing up. Food is simply great. Buffet carbs and veg spread is impressive. Meats are really great too and we particularly enjoyed the garlic beef
5
Went on a Sunday evening to celebrate a family birthday. The staff went out of their way to make us welcome, accommodate different food requirements, look after our Birthday Cake, and the food was excellent. This place has bee here for many years, but they have not forgotten how to run a restaurant
5
Wow , great food!! A nice buffet concept with two options a full meal or a salad buffet. We went uncontrollable eating, as the meat was so delicious especially the chicken hearts. Salad selection was more. Drinking a beer there would be a wrong choice as u can ask the restaurant personals for suggestion of wine which would pair your food
5
I've been to similar restaurants in different parts of the world but this is the best by far (other than in S America itself). The only problem is to stop eating - the food quality is excellent.
5
I went to a few Churrascaria before, and in my opinion, this is the best in Singapore. The salad selection is superb. Friendly and helpful staff, they are very playful as well, really brighten up your day. The quality of the meat was just excellent, well marinated, well prepared, really a true delight. I have been there a few times and the quality remains high. Definitely a must try is you are a fan of meat and you can eat a large quantity of serving
5
What a great way to spend an evening eating as much meat as you possibly can fit into your stomach! The waitstaff were friendly and the food delicious. The salad bar was very good and offered a wide variety of options. It's a little out of the way from the hustle and bustle, but it's worth the effort to get there.
5
Must go place when in Singapore, but on a very empty stomach as the meats you get is free flow, all freshly grilled, and served by a passador right from the grill onto your plate, the beef cuts served are something you would cherish for a long time, The Caiprinha is out of the world, bit pricey but worth every dollar spent
5
I have been a regular customer here since 1994. It is by far the best restaurant by any standard. The food, service, attention to detail etc is par excellence. Many Churusco's in Singapore but these guys started it and maintain it. Don't waste time with the rest. As a frequent traveller, 21 years and I still have not found a better spot! God bless guys:
4
I went last night with some friends to say goodbye to them & Sing, and it was a good choice. We all enjoyed the various meats which are cooked well. The beef topside melted and I always enjoy the well done layer. My favourite was the lamb. I was also impressed by the range in the salad bar. That was a meal by itself. Good wine list too. Judging by other diners this is a good place for large groups. Excellent value at about 50 Sing Dollar each
4
We visited as a large party of friends including one nursing infant. The staff made us feel at home even though the baby did fuss a little. This really made the difference in making us feel welcome. It was a particularly nice gesture that the serving staff were visibly more cautious when carving meats near the baby.The food itself was very good. Having visited similar establishments in the UK, I can testify that the meats were of superior quality to that found in the typical meat buffet places. Everything was well-marinated, juicy and tender. It's a place to literally stuff your face with meat until you can take no more.The buffet was good as well. Stuff kept the area clean and tidy. There was a good selection of dishes to appeal to local tastes.Non-meat highlights:I feel a need to dedicate a section to these as it would be only too easy to forget them in a meat-induced coma.The cheese puffs were a big hit. They come fresh out of the oven in a little basket. At our table, each basket was devoured pretty much as soon as it had been set down.Bbq-ed pineapple was so refreshing and yummy after all the heavy meats. I had never tried this dish before . What a revelation
5
We began at tables outside the front door for drinks before dinner, then into the restaurant, we were a party of 12, and once inside we went to the buffet to pick out starters / accompaniments to the meat courses that were to come. A wide variety of starters which would satisfy any range of choices, or so it seemed to me.The meats were served off of skewers at the table itself, sliced according to the wishes of the customers and the variety was wide, beef, ham, pork, chicken, beef heart, lamb, sausages, there may have been others which I missed or lost count of, all of which were cooked perfectly to my taste except for some of the beef which I found was too rare for me. However, I am probably in a minority these days in that I prefer beef well done, which is not the fashion at the moment.And had I asked I am sure I would have been supplied with something well done, but there was more than enough of everything else.I was a guest for this one but I understand the standing charge for this buffet / running meat fest is reasonable, this is not a place to go if you are not hungry and not a place to go too often if concerned about cholesterol, but I am sure once in a while is good for you.The staff could not have been more helpful and efficient, and were particularly patient about many requests to stand on chairs and take photos, I think they handled all 12 cameras during the evening. A really great evening and well recommended for others
4
Be warned! This place is strictly for serious meat lovers-:)They serve a wide variety of meat, marinated and grilled (South American style) to perfection. Ambiance is nice, quite and romantic and service is friendly. Pleasent dining experience enought to fill you apettite for meat for a month
5
We come here quite frequently and every time it is a delight for us! Great selection of buffet, very very good service (friendly and outstanding staff, especially the ever-smiling and happy Brazilian meet specialists) and great meet selection, variety and quality. We are looking forward for our next visit :) obrigado!!
5
This is the first Brazilian restaurant my family and I want to. The salad bar is okay. This is a meat lovers paradise. The meat is very tender and tasty. Being that this was our first visit to a Brazilian we did not quite expect what was going to happen with people bring food and cutting it for you at the table but, it was fun and the servers were friendly. We have been back many times and have always enjoyed the food. For my daughter's, 2nd birthday she even requested to go to this restaurant
5
For meat lovers: definitely a place to go in Singapore. Have visited a similiar restaurant in Sao Paulo recently and can say that the quality of the meat was definitely very good, also the barbecued pineapple is a great idea for in-between. Very tender and delicious meat!As always in churrascerias: Dont waste to much space in your stomach with the salad buffet although the quality and variety of the buffet was very good too. Amazing was the service: Never experienced such a warm and personal service anywhere in Singapore before
3
The meat served was good quality and tasty. The self serve sides were reasonable but I would have like to have seen some mustard and sauces to go with the meat. The men serving the meat were friendly but I ended up with a couple of meat splashes on my feet from the flicking of the knife. The service from the waiters was not as good as that from those serving the meat, it was slow and no one explained to us how it all worked. The table for 4 against the wall felt a little squashed but the restaurant was clean and the tables had good space between them. I would have given the rating as very good if the cost wasn't so high for what was served. For the cost of the meal we paid we have had better meals elsewhere. Definitely not a bad experience but it won't go in our favourites
5
This place is super. Really authentic and the meat just keeps coming until you want to explode. Good selection of wines too. I've been here many times now, and although pricey (isn't everywhere in Singapore these days?) it is well worth a visit if you like your Brazilian food
5
In this restaurant, the concept is that you pay a fixed price and they will come to your table with all their different meat selection and you could eat any amount you want. There's is a wide selection of meat... Beef, chicken, mutton, pork, fish, duck..I find their beef the best as it is very well seasoned and juicy. There are more than one type of beef served but all are perfect.For the vegetable, it is buffet style.. But i was advice by the staff "Go easy on the vegetable" and i think this is a very good advice because this is a MEAT restaurant and the highlight of the food is meat. So, you will not want to fill yourself with vegetables and miss out the good part...For alcohol i tried both the Caparinaha and the Sangria but i find the Saangria the best. Recommend that you make a booking if you go on Fri or Sat as they are usually full...Nothing bad to say about the food except that the price is a bit steep... But worth every cent.. Staff is also very friendly and professional.
4
What do you do when your daughter declares she is hungry for a meaty dinner? You head over to Brazil on Sixth Avenue, where the meat is simply delicious and plentiful! We were not disappointed as the excellent passadores plied us with endless cuts of beef chicken duck pork and lamb from their long sword-like skewers. All this topped with grilled pineapple which as generously sliced onto our plates. Bravo!
4
Staff were excellent, my wife being Brazilian they immediately brought out the choice cuts including her favorite - chicken hearts. However, as warned by the staff, the sausages, which is one of my favorites, were poor chicken substitutes. The rest of the meat was as expected from a Churrascaria. Also, ensure you ask for farofa, they do have it, just not at the buffet
4
Brazil Churrascaria has been known for more than 15 years. Yeah! And I havenâ€™t even tried it out. So I did a little bit research on the tripadvisor and the result was all great. Most of them are positive opinions. It made me feel more curious than before to find this place. In fact, when I arrived there, there are lots of people who ordered salad and meat. Then, right. The salad was soooo fresh and I can even feel the freshness of the lettuce. I looked like reading the review made by people on tripadvisor here. Everything was so perfect and it seemed like a heaven to me
5
Well if you like your meat you'll love this place.We ate there tonight and glad we did. There is a standard $45 charge per head and you eat as much food from the salad bar and the meat that is served to you by the stream of waiters that cut the meat off the skewers in front of you. Favourites included the top side beef, tenderloin beef and chicken heart!We did not book a table so had to wait about 10 minutes to sit down. The waiters were very friendly and always encouraged you to try the meat! The restaurant is about 15 mins outside the city centre but worth a visit
5
We have been visiting Brazil Churrascaria for several years now. It never fails to satisfy. The hot salad bar is in itself very satisfying but the range of about a dozen types of eat-as-much-as-you can meats makes it one of the best venues for meat-lovers in Singapore. At about $50 per head without drinks, it any day beats paying exorbitant sums for single-steak meals.The restaurant has been in existence for about 20 years but has a low-key character. Its single outlet in Sixth Avenue allows it to concentrate on quality and its reputation spreads by word-of-mouth. The owners have sensibly resisted the temptation to open more outlets in Singapore, which so often is the downfall of many a good restaurant.The icing on the cake at this restaurant are their well-trained and highly professional Passadors (servers). If you are celebrating a birthday, don't forget to ask them to sing Happy Birthday to you in Portuguese - its an experience you won't forget in a hurry!Overall, its an old family favourite to which we shall return whenever we can
3
We came here for a family birthday celebration having read the reviews online. It did not disappoint. It is very different from any other dining experience in Singapore. A bit like a UK Pizza Hut salad bar, but with as many different types of meat as you can imagine! In fact, although the meat is very well cooked, very tasty and indeed it is nice to try different meats, by the end of the meal think we counted 10 different selections! Pig, cow, chicken, duck, lamb all cooked in different ways. A fun and interesting experience, but almost too many different meats. It makes the meal more of a bizarre experience than a culinary one. Still, can imagine coming back and perhaps taking a large group for the fun of the experience. Should have a "good" rather than "average" rating, but it's not "very good.
4
Tried this place on a whim yesterday as me and wifey were in mood for a carnivorous night out. Hehe. A cosy little restaurant located off 6th avenue, celebrated intensely for christmas (we were seated right next to a glittering huge christmas tree)We were ushered in upon arrivval (I had reserved a place beforehand - and upon second thought it was a good idea as the restaurant filled up very quickly by 8pm with a queue of 5-6 people waiting outside)As we seated, we were served drinks menu. Do try the brazilian cocktails. I liked the second one (caipiroska) much better than the signature caipirinha that they recommend.You can choose between light dinner (salad bar only) or full dinner comprising both the salad bar and the choice of meats. Given our meat craving, we went for the full dinner option and skipped the salad entirely. And...the meat assault began. We started on barbecued chicken, followed by duck breast, 3 different cuts of beef, chicken heart, fish. I really apprecited the pineapple served in between as it cleanses the palate between new cuts of meat.While the service was commendable with staff mindful of empty plates/glasses etc and refilling quickly with our choice of meats, I found the food average. Its certainly not the best barbeque I have had. Also the doneness of meat varies not just between different cuts but also between 2 different batches of the same cut. A piece of tenderloin I had was so rare, I could almost taste blood in it. However, overall I liked the experience of being served right off the skewers at the table side as well as the cocktails. It costs 45SGD ++ for the dinner, and an average of 12.80 SGD ++ for each drink. We had 2 drinks each besides the dinner and I spent 75SGD ++ per person.As I said, worth trying once for sure
4
I've been visiting Brazil for the last 15 years & it's always lived up to expectation ! Good variety of salads & more ( separate rows for hot & cold) & the meats are excellent cuts, always fresh, well marinated & served in the traditional Churrascaria manner. Many of the staff have been with Brazil from the time it opened in 1994 ! All a very jovial & fun lot 
5
If you are a meat lover, in Singapore?! Here is a perfect place, I loved the atmosphere on that place, staff is very warm friendly [especially their waiter] they never let your plate empty and always come back to refill it till you die :pNot only the meat has variety, the salad bar is delicious tempting too, & you can help yourself to chose all different types of salad they serve in the middle of the room.Most unique thing I remember is the barbecue pineapple at the end of the meat journey, it neutralize all the meat taste on your mouth before you take they highly recommended creme brulee as a desert :
4
As tourists in Singapore we read rwviews on this place and made the effort to catch a cab for the 15 min drive and we're glad we did.The style of eating with a self-serve buffet and the waiter coming to each diner to slice off freshly grilled meat through your meal had to be explained to us but once we got the hang if it we were fine.I'm not a huge meat eater (certainly no barbecued chicken hearts for me !) so I found the strong flavoured meats such as smoked pork and the lamb a little rich but there was plenty of salads, rices and pasta in the buffet area.The men in our family LOVED this place - it was carnivore heaven !My 7yo is a fussy eater and didn't eat much and the waiter was kind enough to remove the charge for one child. Very nice considering he knew we were just tourists. My 12 yo really enjoyed the food and the restaurant were very welcoming to families with children.I would definitely recommend this restaurant but plan to just go there for the meal as there is nothing else other than food places in this small restaurant strip.I would not hesitate to dine here again, or recommend it to other people
5
I had a birthday dinner here for 30 people last Friday and I am eating again here this evening Thursday. I have eaten many time Churasscaria in Brazil the country and this is as close as it gets. I have been coming here for over 18 years! All the family love it. A must try when you live in Singapore. If your only here for a few days so many other Singaporean places to eat
5
If you are a meat lover then you should definitely dine here and for those who are vegetarian, they do serve a very generous selection of salad that is equally amazing!The meat were well marinated and fresh and of the best cut! Really love to eat here each time that we visit Singapore.You will see lots of wall plagues of this restaurant's awards and it is fully justified thru each bite!It's the type of meal that you will still think of long after you have left the restaurant, I kid you not!So do try this place out and really highly recommended :Q
4
Saw the reviews and decided to check it out. A little skeptical since it sounded too good to be true for the price, but we weren't disappointed. We lived in Brasil for 3 years so know a little about churrascarias! No, this isn't Porcao nor Fogo de Chao, but for the price, we'll be back! The pao de quejo was a little disappointing, a bit hard, but the palmitos (hearts of palm) made up for it in the buffet. The black beans were good but was missing something, and unfortunately I really miss the fried/grilled bananas that you normally get. But the meats they served were very flavorful and make up for the other shortfalls. The galinha (chicken) was my favorite and very tasty, as was the roasted beef. A couple of the waiters are from Brasil, and with their infectious smiles, and a few caipiroskas, we felt we were back in Brasil! Saudades
4
the BBQ is good, if you are not brazilian, probably this is a very good choice for a meat lover. however if you are either brazilian or argentinian... better go to a steakhouse.please don't take me wrong, this is valid for the majority of Brazilians restaurants abroad, as there is no way to serve the brazilian cuts and charge 30-40 USD... so it is very difficult to ask for more.the best brazilian restaurant abroad is still the Fogo de Chao, but for that you will spend 100 US
4
The Brazil Churrascaria is the closest think that you can have outside Brazil,The meat is tasty and juice,the sides are nicely done and the salad buffet is fare.But remember you are not in brazil so its not fare to compare The Brazil Churrascaria to a Original Brazilian BBQ like Oasis or Porcao ,because in Brazil we have a different culture of eating and our economy is also affordable for waste of food the way that we operate the Churrascarias in Brazil
5
Loved the grill! One of the most memorable meals we had in Singapore during the 7 days we were there with great wines and service!
4
The food is excellent and there is a good salad bar. The best Brazilian restaurant in Singapore. Reservations are a must. Service is not very warm and welcoming. They can be quite cold towards customers.
4
Yummy food. just hard to walk out at the end...be sure and eat the pineapple. this help tremendously.
5
I have been there with my friend. it was amazing and mixed salad bar with some food. the meat is nice and tender. dont forget to get your grilled pineapple at the end.
4
Place is small, but comfortable.Food is great, both the salad bar as well as the meat the comes round and round.It is like going to the Brazilian Carnival, except that its for the food.Carnivorously satisfied.Friends and I love it. Will definitely come back whenever I ma back in town
4
The last time I came to this restaurant was 10 years ago. The place looks the same and may be a little livelier. The staff handled the reservation well. My son is a meat lover and he thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The flow of various meat was fantastic. We never have to wait for the meat to arrive. the waiters were friendly and we had a good time being canivores for the night
5
I personally thought this place was better than the churrascaria in Fair Oaks, Washington DC. Firstly is well proceed at around $45 pp, the wine was spectacular (S $78), the bigger had some wonderful dressings complimenting the varied fresh salads, and the meat was great (perfectly seared yet very tender and rare). My wife was unimpressed by the sausage and smoked ham which came out first, but agreed the sirloin and lamb was wonderful. Will definitely return.
5
This is excellent, wide range of salad bar, wide range of meat, from topside, ribeye, lamb, roasted chicken, chicken heart,turkey ham, pork sausage and most of not their famous pineapple, We love it rosted a little darker. They have great wines and cocktails to go along with the meat, highly recommended this restaurant for the meatlovers.Lunch is serve at $38++ excluding drinks, price is alright, if you are a huge meateaterer!!Friendly and good service! Thumbs up!
4
A dinner with good pals.The restaurant staff were friendly and helpful.We were early and had a huge hamper &several loaves of bread in a bag. The staff offered to help us store it elsewhere so that we can hv a nice dinner. How thoughtful...The we had the warm cheese bread. Very tasty indeed and we had many helpings.We like the different cocktail esp the recommended caiprihnia.Then we had the salad. Variety& quality greens we had. Then we finally devour the meats.4 of us are meat eaters & we just eat and eat and paired the meats with lots ofcaramelized pineapple.There were turkey ham, roasted chicken, pork sausages, beef top side, beef rump, lamb? Smoked duck, chicken hearts. Other than the salty turkey ham, we like all the meats!Would be nice if there were different types of sausages.We will definitely be back again!!& we will take more photos of the meats!
5
Lots of fresh tasty meats, quickly offered by servers to keep you satisfied.If youa re not familiar - this is apparently the traditional Brazilian way of serving meat - they bring a huge skewer/sword to the table, and huge chunks of meat are skewered on the skewer. The server slcies off pieces directly onto your plate. Only thing to beware of is overeating
4
Nice place at the marina bay sands. Lots of meat served. I liked the pork more than the chicken and beef but that is a personal choice. Service is a little on the slow side when the restaurant is full
5
Whow what a place- excellent food- loads of it. Cooked to perfection and many choises, hands off the salad bar that files your stomage quick and leaf no place for the good meat.
3
The buffet price they charged per person is reasonably high at $45++ which does not include beverage. Please be aware that if you require plain water, they will bring u a small jug (2 person to share) and charge you $10 for it and the waiting staff will not mention that it is chargeable ( we had the bill shock!). As for the meat, nothing fantastic but quite salty to my taste. As all the meats are not marinated with spices or any special sauces ( i think most are seasoned with salt and pepper only)..that was why most of the meat tasted the same, except for the lamb/mutton, i only ate a bite as i found the taste/smell was way too strong (even for a lamb lover like me!)...my verdict? Once is enough, thank you
5
Being steakhouse owners ourselves, we can safely state that this restaurant serves first class beef, very expertly marinated and - as customary in these 'pasador-style' Churrascarias - grilled, and cut at the table exactly as you like it. There are several Brazilians in the service team, and as most Brazilians, they all are charming, helpful and efficient. Very highly recommended in Singapore, and the best of its class in Singapore
3
Turned up at 6:30pm on a Saturday night without a reservation so was pleased to be able to get a table. The restaurant is quite compact though didn't feel the tables were too close together. We were given a drinks menu which a selection of wines, beers and cocktails. In all my previous visits to Brazilian restaurants I've known I shouldn't fill up on the salads but have ended up doing so - not here as the salad selection was quite ordinary. On returning to our table we then had 10 mins of constant delivery of a good selection of meats - the lamb and smoked duck were our favorites. It then died down again for quite some time so you can then actually enjoy your food. When you are looking for your second wave of meat the servers didn't seem to be available so you end up having to ask to track down your favorites. Overall it was an enjoyable even and the food was fine but it just wasn't up to the standard of similar restaurants in Brazil, US and Europe.
5
The meat cuts keep coming and you can keep eating as much as you wish to. There are different cuts of beef, ham, chicken, pork, lam and fish, all equally delicious. There is a generous salad spread as well. Vegetarians be warned that there is absolutely nothing for you here. One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore
4
Meat, meat and more meat...this is a carnivore's mecca and vegetarians should strictly look elsewhere. The quality of the produce is excellent, and the quantity depends on you. The salad bar is pretty nice as well, though I would recommend you strictly use them as accompaniments and save all the stomach space for the meat
5
This place is still the best in terms of food quality and service. They also change or enhance their selection from time to time based on customers' feedback. I've tried pretty much all the restaurants with this concept once but will now stick to this place - unless they drop significantly in their standard, which they have not over the last 10 years. The Passasdors really give you the feeling they enjoy their job and serving you. I have not experienced this in any of the other places
5
Have tried the other places in Singapore that serve the same but this one beats them hands down. The variety of meats available is better and so is the non-meat buffet spread. My favourite has to be the fried bananas, the tenderloin and the chicken hearts. I love how they offer beautifully carmelised pineapple to balance out the heaviness of all the meats.The service team is always cheerful and are so obliging with requests for certain cuts of meat etc. Definitely a great value for the money and it has always been a pleasure dining there over the years.

+ Located 15 minutes away from downtown.+ Dinner starts at 6pm.+ Good selection of side dishes and salads in the salad bar.+ A lot of juicy tasty meats, most of which are delicious (I loved the lamb most).+ Price is SGD 45 = USD 35/person.- Service is too fast, waiters keep coming to fill your plate even if it's already full (so if you're a slow eater you need to tell them to slow it down a bit)

MEAT MEAT and more meat.. meat heaven. Great food , great atmosphere!!!!!!!!!!!!
2
Great spot but all the meat we had was over done and dry and the service although not bad, not very welcoming and everything took too long. If you really need a meat fix worth one visit but don't have high expectations.
3
The variety of side dishes they provide is too little.
4
I don't eat blooded meat - but I know many do - and I hear great reviews about this joint - support it!
4
The food is still good value, though the standards have been surpassed.
4
Um first tip is you should not come late because it is mainly focusing on meatNote:This is not a place for vegetariansThe side dishes are not that yummy but the meat is great If you come late,you will have a problem digesting it so BE CAREFULIf you do worry,there is ice cream and sweets in 7eleven near the restaurant if you want something sweet to calm down the meat Last time,i had a stomach ache because I was eating the meat so again be carefu

There are now several Brazilian Churrascaria's in Singapore but don't bother with any of the others. This is the only one that is truly authentic with real Brazilian cuts such as Picania and Hump.Awesome lamb, as well as many other meats to choose from including chicken and chicken liver. Salad bar is great and the wine selection not over priced. This place has been going 18 years and once you have been you understand why. A bit off the beaten track as you need a 15 minute taxi ride from downtown but that is why it is an expat place not full of tourist'
4
What I like about the place is the excellent meat they have and the service. There is a wide variety of sides at the salad bar as wel. People from Brazil are serving hence they bring originality to the joint. Have not experiences them to be racists, afterall the staff is very multinational: locals as well as brazilians...It is a bit expensive but really worth it

Ever since it first opened, this restaurant carved a well deserved niche for itself by maintaining food and service quality levels. Its location caters for both the local and the expat communities. Parking can be a bit challenging ..don't expect to park in front ..but there are ample parking lots behind the restaurant.The buffet food has a wide choice and there is something for everyone. The main meat dishes are brought to your table and sliced onto your plate ...its authentic Brazilian fare no doubt. The wine list has a good variety and prices are fair.Service was excellent, even with a full house ..and being the furthest table ..we were well served. We will be bac

You can't beat the real thing wenjoyed in Sao Paulo but this was a very good evening with excellent quality meat and very good service at a reasonable price. we went as a couple but as always with Churrascarias you can have even more fun if you go as a group. Salad bar was very good and the skewered baked pineapple a novelty worth trying. Overall well recommended
4
Great selection of meats...but too overwhelming for me
4
Meat lovers rejoice, excellent value for money!
4
Amazing BBQ meats. Beef, lamb, chicken, pork, nearly everything was good. Far better than Carnivore at Vivocity. Wide variety at the salad bar. I was not bowled over by the chicken hearts though. I will definitely return.
4
made the mistake of attacking the fantastic salad bar before getting to the meat! That didn't leave much room for the delicious meats!
5
The seasoning is good but a bit too salty. Try the tenderloin!!
5
For the meat lovers. Yum!! especially the chicken hearts

If you like meat out of a grill, this is your place. I have been to many Brazilian rotisserie kind of places here in Singapore but this one stands out for sure. The difference is in their well stocked salad bar, well seasoned and moist meats, and excellent service. The service really really stands out. I think from the second time onwards they have remembered my name. Now that they know that I am a returning customer they definitely treat me well but I have got the same feedback from friends to whom I have recommended this restaurant. One other difference I have noticed as compared to other all you can eat rotisserie places is that they don't try to stuff you quickly and give you indications that you should stop and leave now. My wife organized a little surprise birthday party for me at this restaurant with a couple of friends and they really made it extra special. I am going back again when I have the craving for some good meat. Must try - beef ham, garlic beef, grilled pineapple, coconut manjar

I luv my Churrascaria and eat a lot of it in Brazil...But then i was pleasantly surpassed to find the same taste and quality right here in SINGAPORE. at the Chimes outlet, the meat was soft and tender and great value for the buffet price. Only thing missing was the chicken heart and liver...Overall good place, value for money and pleasant ambienc

Had an early dinner here for our combined birthdays.Friendly helpful staff - beef topside was superb and other grilled meats were all good.Attractive range at salad bar but naturally the grills have centre stage.Could benefit by introducing an authentic chimichurri sauce.Thank you all for a memorable meal!Obrigado! tudo por uma refeicao memorave

Good if you are a meat lover. The meat that are served from the skewers are done just right - not overcooked which would render the meats tough and dry. You get to eat all you want - so it is real value for your money
3
yummy meats and pineapple
4
Love the black beans
4
The salad bar is good enough if you are a vegetarian.
3
Tried a while back. Good if you are big time meat eater. Alternative is Canivore at Chimes or Vivocity.
2
Not really nice. But should at least try once.
3
For meat lovers!

im a meat lover. and a place which only serves meat meat and more grilled meat certainly hits the right spots with me. used to go once in a while with seiya, back when i still had a humongous appetite....still remember the taste of that beef rump mmm

4
Excellent meats and a big spread of salads coupled with good service - will certainly go back there again.
3
The chicken breast and the beef ham (I think that's what it's called) were very tender. The others were average. Our waitress, Karen, was friendly and attentive. As a whole, the restaurant's atmosphere is quite relaxed.
3
meat lovers, come here.
3
Great value for meat lovers. Limited recommendation for families, as not so much space between the tables.
4
Does quite a good churrascaria, the better one of the few branches in Singapore.
4
This is one of my favourite restaurants in SG. I love the salad bar, they have the right stuff like beets and other salad dishes the way I like them, with chick peas and beans.Other than the salad, the lamb and beef are to die for. Its better than most buffets I've been to
4
This is surely a meat lovers' heaven. This place serves nothing but meat, glorious meat, all kinds of meat! For the price of $42 per person, you'll be entitled to a wide selection of salad choices and a even wider selection of meat choices. Go straight for the beef Great ambience, fantastic service, what more can you ask for

mY INTRODUCTION TO bRAZIL MEAT and it's fantastic stuff
3
Waiters slice marinated beef, pork, lamb, and other types of meat off jumbo skewers onto your plate. Meat was good but the salad bar was rather sad tho'. The veg looked droopy and had seen better days...
4
Meat!!! Love the meats!!! Ready for hot hot love after that!!!
5
Meat, meat and meat. Perfect :)
3
it's worth the money only if you eat alot of meat. they have a salad bar for the vegos but why bother going into a churrascaria if you're not going to stuff yourself silly with all forms of meaty delights. for me, it's worth the first experience plus, i love the pineapple and the cheesy puffs
4
Great ambience! Nice staff.. I tried chicken heart here for the first time. Costs about $50 for the buffet without wine.
