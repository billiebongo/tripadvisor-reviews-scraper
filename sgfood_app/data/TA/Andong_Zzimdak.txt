Felt that the portion was too big for 2; we soon got sick of it and couldn't finish. There are noodles and potatoes in the dish so no need for carbs. Ordered boneless thigh so meat is tender but it's still a bit too spicy for me. Pretty salty too. Liked the steamed egg. If there were more people, then we can order other food to share and will prob enjoy it more. There is a 50% off the zzimdak so pricewise it's very reasonable

Pros :+ Taste quite good+ Lunch menu price is okCons :+ Size is rather small if compared to "western standard"+ Air con is too warm+ One of the waiter (tall guy with glasses) was quite a rusher, i practically just putting down my spoon, and he saw it then directly picking up the plate(Actually it's better to wait for the consumer to stand and leave

Never heard of this place, but came with some friends when one of them wanted Korean.Didn't know the meaning of the dishes. All of them were chicken based, and I had the Mayak which was supposed to be the hottest (spiciest). It was SPICY!! I take chilli padi, and it was up there with the hottest of them. Probably used up half their tissue box just to wipe the sweat off my brow. The chicken was tender enough and there was lots of gravy if you're like me and want the rice to swim in it :)Also had the add-on Kimchi Soup with Pork. So so only, wouldn't try it unless you really want some soup that day

Spicy plate of stewed chicken. Even if we select the seafood version, there is also chicken inside the stew. Spicy and not too salty. Good comfort food if you like spicy stuff. The sweet potato noodles in the stew is delicious too. A little expensive though

The restaurant is located at the basement of Raffles city. Small sitting area, however the customer turnover was pretty quick and we didnt have to wait too long. After taking a queue number, we were seated within 15-20 minutes. We ordered the medium size original Andong Jjimdak, with a rice and no other entrees. The Andong Jjimdak was a little underwhelming. The sauce was not fragrant enough, neither was it spicy enough. Serving was a decent size for 3 people, though I would suggest that everyone should order a rice. Food was rather pricey though for the serving size

Went with a group of friends, restaurant was small. As expected, there's no reservation service available. Queue took awhile. We ordered Seafood and Boneless Jjimdak, Mini Seafood Pancake and Tteokbokki. Comparing Jjimdak from Korea, this much watery and not spicy. A Must to order rice, perfect match for the Jjimdak sauce! Mini Seafood Pancake was good, crispy and not oily. Tteokbokki tasted average
