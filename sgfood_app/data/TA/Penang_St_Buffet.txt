Happy staff happy customer, you can find that their staffs really work happily together. Maybe due to that atmosphere, they serve their customers well. Overall their Penang cuisine is very nice, with great customer service a bonus ;P

Most dishes are very good esp. the salted eggs prawns and penang otah.
Some dishes can be improved.
Friendly service and nice ambiance. We had a great time!

The serving size is small and the price did not match the serving size. The food took longer than expected to arrive, given that there were not many people in the restaurant at that time.

Firstly, I really want to compliment their excellent customer service. For their food, we ordered premium fried kuey teow, prawn noodle and bronze seafood platter, they tasted better than our expectation. The portion is big and we enjoyed our dinner a lot.

I went here with my family consisting of 6 adults and 2 toddlers. The staff are friendly and arranged baby chairs, cutleries without even us having to ask for it. We ordered the BBQ seafood platter and a variety of noodles. The prawn mee is my favourite. It is a must-order when you're here. The char kway teow was rather average in my opinion and at a rather much higher price than your average hawker centre. The premium char kway teow with salted egg and crab is just plain no. I love salted egg and crab, but they don't go well when combined with char kway teow. Plus it is $15 a plate. Despite that, I would come back to this place for that prawn mee. It is the only dish that is a stand out.

The food was served fast. Staff service was great, except one particular staff who seemed to get impatient easily. Environment was not bad. Deserves future visits.

This restaurant is no longer a Buffet restaurant, but the food is OK.
Although was disappointed when find out that they no longer serve buffet, but decided to remain there.

The food quality at Causeway Point branch is not as good as the one at Changi Airport. Have first visited the Changi Airport branch and serves really good and close to authentic food. Tried the Prawn Noodle, Penang Lor Bak, Chendol, Penang Rojak etc at the Changi Airport branch. Ordered the same at Causeway Point and the food is a disappointment as each of the dishes are just average in taste

I was invited to go as bank function.love the crab buffet as there are so many different types of crab..esp salted yolk crab..wont dirty the hands and tasted delicious.the price per pax is not cheap.but to think of the cost a crab outside it is worth the money.special mention to the durian penang chendol and yam paste with pumpkin.not too sweet and with heavy servings of durian..must have at least two rounds.the mini cakes and marshmallow was also a hit with guests with sweet tooth.however the grilled stingray was a let down as it was not fresh at all..the lobster flesh was too tough..but for such a neighbour place,the buffet is a great treat to all

Food is nice but there was a choice on whether u want the buffet with the seafood or not. We opted out. So there's quite a few dishes that we can't eat due to our choice of buffet. Overall I'd say,not too bad because my in-laws are enjoying...
