Very good rice bowls with meat, fills you up well and fast! It's cheap, fast and delicious. Add chilli and soy sauce for better taste.

After hours of mall hopping at Chinatown point, we came across this restaurant and tried their beef bowl with steam rice and vegetable, served hot, taste is okay, the beef compliments the rice, good for lunch. Affordable price.
