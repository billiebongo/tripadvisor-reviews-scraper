Visited the Orchard Central outlet this week to try the ice cream. There's plenty of seating here and an ok choice of icecream. Service was efficient and the location is easily reached from the mrt.
2
The ice cream itself was very underwhelming and is far away from the excellent creation of its competitor that also serves ice cream creations mixed with ingredients on a cold slab. The toppings overpowered the mediocre tasting ice cream base, which tastes quite bland.
5
I had the strawberry and banana prremium and it was worth every bit the money. Ice cream was delicious. They did not have 1 ice-cream listed on the menu..but who cares...its on the same floor as Samsung towards another side of the Mall
4
Enjoyed one for one milkshake with NTUC card. I tried Chocolate & Peanut Butter, that is really good!!! I will go for that again!!
4
We regularly visit the vivo city outlet, the ice cream is very good! However they seem to have reduced size of toppings while keeping the price the same ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
5
After 5 years I finally decided to try Cold Stone, and not I am kicking myself why not earlier. Well better late than never. Very enjoyable ice creams, I tried the center at HillV2. in hillview. Very good service. Not crowded. Very good choice. After eating at so many others and the utterly useless "udders", I could not imagine that I'll imagine this one so much. Price wise its fairly priced, if they can offer promos it would be fantastic. My children really enjoyed and so did my wife. That says a lot
3
Visited the outlet in Hillview recently to try the icecream. There is a good selection of fairly exotic ice cream, but not much if you're looking for something simple. I opted for the berry ice cream which was tasty enough but the frozen berries didn't have much flavour. I will probably try a different one next time

The kiddoes recommended this place for us to try, so we did. The outlet at Orchard Central was popular though it was a Sunday night. Tried ordering a brownie with vanilla ice cream but the brownie sold out. Ordered a waffle as alternative with chocolate ice cream. Also tried a signature mix called strawberry + banana + white choco chip ice-cream. The signature item was nice. The waffle on the other hand was pre-made already, stored in plastic bags and then heated up again before serving. One scoop of chocolate ice-cream was added on top. We collected it when the buzzer buzzed. Whatever it is about the desserts, this place is the hang-out place for youngsters and millennial - according to our kiddos who belong to this category:

Some of the best premium ice cream flavours - the cake batter ice cream is heavenly. There is a great selection of toppings too - our only disappointment was that there was no cookie dough topping (unlike locations in other countries). Nevertheless very different to any other ice cream parlour
1
I would have given no stars but had to give at least 1 to rate. The customer service here is terrible. I waited in the line to be served for more than 5 minutes, this is not the problem as this place is always busy. My complaint is that when it was my turn to be served the young attendant just looked straight at me then proceeded to serve the person after me. Not only was this rude but whilst serving this person she just kept looking at me. I decided that as I was not good enough to serve my money was also not good enough for them. I have been in the retail industry all my working career and am aware of good customer service. Will never use this establishment again
5
It Was Just Awesome... The Staff Was Very Nice and Polite.... There Were So Many Topping Options...
EveryThing Was Just Amazing....
3
Always good to stop in for shake. Staff are quick but never look happy or engaged. Shakes are a little expensive especially when you compare to the New Zealand ice cream place in the basement of paragon.
4
I enjoy Cold Stone back in the US. This location has good service and a nice area to sit and enjoy your ice cream. The menu offers many selections with a local flair that I enjoy
5
ice cream is really good and the shakes they do are excellent - well worth spending the time to have one and cool down in Singapore!
4
Great ice cream shop located in Orchard Central
Wide selection of specialties, and waffle cones are a must!
2
The ice cream should be lay on the cold stone and mix with any top ups we ordered. They just simply mix and the ice cream was half melted.
5
My favourite ice cream vendor in Singapore - and not just mine as the queues speak for themselves! I personally like the mint and peace ice-cream with gummy bears and roasted almonds... But the great thing is you can mix and match as you wish. My only gripe is that the options are quite rigid (sometimes I would gladly pay for an extra topping!). Great for young and old alike, it's fun to see them work the concoction on a heated plate. Note, be prepared to queue at weekends for 5-10 minutes!
5
Had ice creams here twice (@ Orchard Central, easily accessible from Somerset MRT) inside a week while on a Singapore holiday. Plenty of places to sit, and it was not too crowded around 9 pm. Ice creams were great, as good as in the US, and prepped in the usual cold stone style in front of you. We had the chocolate devotion and the founder's favorite and both were excellent. Service was quick and efficient, so nothing to complain about at all.Highly recommended for all 
1
The ice-cream was sickly sweet. And is bad for you. I regret even trying. I won't be back .From what I have read it contains "Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil" which is very bad for your health. The color of some of their flavors looks very artificial
4
On thing we noticed in Orchard road shopping centres is that there aren't many places to sit down. We came across Cold Stone by accident, and glad we did. They seemed to have all basic ice cream flavours and then you get to add extra bits, which they then mash up all together on a marble slab. Ice cream on a hot afternoon in air-conditioned comfort watching all the shoppers go by. What a great way to spend half an hour to get your energy levels back to normal. A small serve with two extra ingredients cost S$6

I went ther last night with my family we waited in a very long line to be served and after that we found out that cold stone doesn't have vanilla icream in Singapore.
5
We love this place, and regularly visit whenever we are in town. the new location is much more practical, however i feel that the queue is in the wrong direction, as during busy times the line blocks the elevators!
4
Title says it all - just ticked the box and spot for a cool treat after a hot day exploring - real enjoyed - bit of a line to get served but that perhaps showed the popularity more then anything.
5
The ice cream here are so delicious with all the different flavors. I dont mind eating my way to add up two size in here. Staff is really friendly, chill and not too busy except on the weekends.
5
Walking through a shopping centre and stumbled across this little gem of a store.
Felt like an ice cream pancake and they made it fantastic.
Plenty of options and inexpensive.
Let me back there
5
Located in Orchard Central has ample sitting spaces and open till late night. A perfect place to have after dinner chats with most wonderful ice creams.
4
Mud pie mojo. Like the crunch of the almonds. The flavour of the ice cream wasn't strong enough. Quite expensive for the size
4
This is my first time visiting Cold Stone and I was very amazed with the way they did my ice cream. Unlike other places where they just scoop up your ice cream and put in a cone but over here they mixed it in front of my eyes and tossed it into the air and catch it in the cone. I wouldnt mind paying again to see that. Very fun filled place with good vibes! A definetely must go
3
I went to this place @Vivo City yesterday. I ordered Sherbet Orange flavor. The ice cream itself was super sweet. Sherbet supposed to be more sour and sweet came after. The orange Sherbet was purely sweet and too much Sweet for my liking. The waffle was not crispy at all.Besides that they way they scooped an ice cream was so ugly.
4
The choice of ice cream was really too much for me and the toppings were really good with the ice cream too! The way the ice cream melted in my mouth was just brilliant and I kept wanting to go back for more... However, the ice cream is not cheap
4
Variation on the tend to top your own ice cream. Here they mix it all for you on a cold stone. It was pretty good, also not cheap and the sitting area not special. They should also ongoing clean the tables.
5
The choice and taste of Icecream is out of the world one visit is not enough and that is not all you have a huge variety of tempting cakes
4
Lots of choices of ice creams or customise your own, how to choose? took us ages. In the end we had the French Vanilla with fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries, delicious.
5
Order their Mud Pie signature, you will not regret it. Super yummy. Prefer the cup, less messy. Kids love their Oreo overload, lots of oreo cookies.
4
Went there for dessert after lunch. Environment and ambience is quiet and well decorated. Ice cream is custom made to your liking on the spot. Love the taste and clean place. Try the coffee ice cream..
3
Had a basic bucket of ice cream and watched the server bash it all together, forever.
Was blown away at the ridiculous cost of the small bucket of product at $16 SG. Won't go back....
4
i love cold stone, but with a price to pay! always enjoyed the cheesecake flavoured ice cream with graham cookies or twix! the best combination!
5
Cool ice cream preparation. Quite entertaining when they prepare the ice creams. Ice cream was nice and filling.
5
Love Ice cream and just keep going back to this placeColdstone has ensured that whole experiece of having Ice Creams is an experience. This place has a distinctive personal touch in the way they take the orders , to the Ice cream is made the final flip before you get the ice cream. The staff is young, motivated and serve you with a smile though the place is crowded most of the time. Been there number of times so comfortable with the ordering process can be daunting for first timers. Choose the "like it" combo the smallest portion with Waffle if you like ...prefer the standard cup versionLike the normal variants like the Strawberry Rendeveouz without any toppings just loving the fresh strawbery, banana with the creams and standard toppings. My all time favourite. Kids prefer the Chocolate overload with Oreo and other chocolate variantsGo for this place you will not be disappointe
5
It's a;ways a great moment treating yourself with a scoop or two at Cold Stone. They provide enough optiongs to choose and they way the toss the ice cream add some excitement while waiting for your cone or cup. Wide variety of toppings and many locations across Singapore make it one of the best place to enjoy this sweet treat
4
World's Best Ice Cream..Loved the fresh made waffle...The Place is also most ideal...most happening place of singapore..A must visit place for ice cream lovers...
4
My favorite ice cream - very creamy and just the right amount of sweetness. I had chese cake mixed with blueberries and strawberries. Enjoyed it to the last drop. Did not put it in the waffle cone to cut back on a few calories.
4
I have never seen food being cooked on a cold plate. Thi was exactly what I found at cold stone. Icecream being cooked on a cold plate.
The result was a delicious experience
5
Having an awesome ice cream in the hot Singapore weather is one of the perks of life. My fav is Founder's Favourite.
5
When i first time go there i am confused and did not know how to order the ice cream,they patience teach me how to order.They have a deep knowledge in the product and they provided me what i want.
4
If you like ice-cream then this is a great place for you to visit. Delicious ice-creams with a wide variety of flavors and toppings mixed on a cold stone slab along with the entertaining staff who will juggle with your ice-cream before serving it to you.
4
Creative prepared "signatures" of ice flavours and lots of various toppings.Sizes are more than enough, even the "smallest" called "Like it". Maybe a bit too sweet for my taste.The guys tried to make a show in preparing the ice but still practicing and having fun;-)
5
I am a fan of Ice creams especially of Cold Stone. we visited the one at Orchard road and had t2 tubs, Choclate devotion and Cheesecake Fantasy. The ice creams taste just the same every time, and the way she snapped it on the cold slab, to make our Founder Delightt. Worth evey visit in every part of the worl
3
I'm a huge ice cream fan. Any sorts of ice cream, I scream. But perhaps it is just me, I love my rather expensive ice cream firm, sort of a chewy texture and not a melty soft mess. That's what I got from here when I tried it. My bf seems to love his Cheesecake Fantasy to which when I tried, didn't impress me much too. I wish I could love it thou, but it just didn't hit the right spots for me for some reason. But staffs are friendly, the "show" in mixing the ice cream is rather cool. Queue was quite long too when I was there
5
Imagine a perfectly creamy concoction of Cold Goodies and Highly Imaginative Combinations of Ice Cream with Cakes, Cookies, Cream, Toppings and Syrups.- Now Imagine Enthusiastic Young People assisting you in choosing and guiding you in what would possibly please your palate-- Now Further Imagine It all Being Put Together in Front of your Eyes and being served with a Panache!Makes It a Must Visit Place Each Time I am in Singapore!!
5
This was my first ever Coldstone icecream experience. The action of mixing the icecream on the cold stone makes it nice and creamy.
The place offered great flavours. Especially liked the chocolate flavours.. Yumm Yumm..
4
Besides the individual thick and creamy flavors here, the combinations ones are a delight to the sweet tooth too. Enjoyed the ice cream very much and what more, u get to see the service crew tossing the ice cream up the air and into cup.
5
I tried all their chocolate selections and they are all so very nice. I will try the ice cream cakes when we comeback and it's real soon
5
I almost tried all their variants of ice cream. And i can tell that i have no particular flavor because i love everything they serve!
4
Excellent Ice cream.... great team..... great ambience.... love this place.... especially their berry berry and chocolate stuff..... an expansion of the menu especially the shakes would be most welcome....must visit for icecream if you are in that area.
5
have all the ice cream flavors and all is awesome. i have not tried the cakes yet but i will on my next visit.
5
I am a 100% ice cream lover! Anywhere I go, I always tried with my family the famous ice cream parlor there is. Any ice cream with nuts makes it more appealing for me. The ice cream of Cold Stone Creamery particularly their President's Choice is simply one of the best ice cream I have ever tasted. It is really so yummy that one will surely be satisfied. It might be a little exoensive than the other ice cream but with its taste and ingredients, I can say its value for money! Customer service and ambiance is really good as well.
5
I love all their chocolate variants. I think thats the one of the bests i have tried lately. They will prepare your right in front of u. And i think thats what made it look special. Looks easy to do but i dont think if its the same in actua
3
I like how they tried to make it a little different from regular ice cream parlours, the way they prepare their ice creams infront of everyone and display all their cool throwing it up and catching it skills haha! But ultimately the taste is pretty much the same ice cream taste I'd get anywhere so I really don't understand why there is such a long queue all the time. I guess I'm just not that easily impressed. Also, when I was there, the guy making the ice cream dropped the ice cream he was making twice on the floor and obviously made another one with a fresh batch. Such wastage of food is just not appetising to look at, and I wonder how much ice cream is wasted everyday in this false display of bravado.
4
My 3rd ever Coldstone experience. My boyfriend and I get very excited when we see one as we don't have them in the UK. The girl behind the counter through the ice cream in the air before she pounded it on the Coldstone and added the perfect ingredients. We went for cake batter ice cream 'birthday cake remix' and 'peanut butter cup perfection' and perfect it was!
5
Craving for ice cream? Why not try Cold Stone Creamery..wow excellent ice creams..so yummy..the waffles are so crunchy..you will surely forget your diet..love it.
5
I tried almost all the flavors already and all are enough reason to comeback. It's not expensive too. You'll get a very nice ice cream for just $7
5
Their coconut ice-cream is to die for. If ever in Singapore, you must try this flavor. The Cold Stone we visited was on Orchard Road, and can't be missed.
4
My sons love to go there. You can add 3 topics in your ice-cream. And it is very good. It is a little bit expensive but the ice creams are big.
4
Have hear it a lot of good comment about this dessert but did not have a change to try it as always long queue as I am not a very patient people. Yesterday, pass by one of the outlet at Orchard Central, saw the queue not so long so I decide go for a try. While queuing was thinking which signature creations favorites should I try. Cause all look good to me. After a 1 minutes thinking I decided to try their Cookie Mintster. It contain Mint Ice Cream, Double Oreo Cookies &Fudge. Is yummy... Will visit more when I free as it is very nice and yummy..
5
Been to this lovely place twice, in 2011 and 2013. Arguably the best ice-cream parlour in South-East Asia. Professional and friendly staff. Practice very good hygiene too. Good explanation given about the many types of ice-cream flavours. I would spend money on air fare just to come here and eat ice-cream. No joke!One major annoyance, on my last visit here, some Chinese kid was jumping up and down the counter next to the ice-cream!!!!! And sadly, none of the staff told that kid to refrain from doing that. Even his parents didn't give a damn. Very uncivilized behaviour
5
My friend took me to Cold Stone Creamery and this place is fantastic. The staff put on a show for you. They make the flavours in front of you and then throw the ice cream to a colleague who catches it in a cup.Most importantly the flavour and quality of the ice cream. I would say there is a flavour for everyone to enjoy. Whatever you request you will love it. There are various combos of cup sizes you can have and you can add a waffle to it as well, I recommend a chocolate dipped one.Definitely needs to be on your visit list whilst in Singapore.
5
Great experience and great ice cream!You can choose pre-defined combinations of ice-cream and fillings/toppings or choose your own combination. The do three sizes - "like it", "love it" and "gotta have it" (and, for take-out, "mine" and "ours" :-))Once you've chosen, they get a couple of paddles and scoop out a ball of ice cream, then transfer it over to the cold stone area (hence the name I guess) to whack it about and add the toppings/filings. Then they theatrically flip it up and into the cup (or waffle thing if you've gone for that). Quite entertaining and exciting!End result was not disappointing - lovely ice cream. Definitely recommend both the Cheesecake one and the Banana one.So good, we made a point of going back again later in our holiday, with friends
5
If you are visiting Singapore from a country that does not have Cold Stone already, DO NOT DARE MISS IT! If you are travelling with Kids, there are even a stronger case to visit it. Queues can be a bit longer in peak hours, may take 15-20 mins wait time for service.The concept is really nice, you choose your flavour and the toppings and they mix it on a cold marble slab in front of you in a real enthusiastic manner. If you want they can throw the scoop for you to catch in your cup :) and kids love it!!!! I was once wearing a white shirt and the lady gave me an apron to wear before catching the chocolate scoop :). If you drop it, they will make another one for you.Definitely the most lively people I have seen in Singapore restaurtant/shops. High Recommended

Very big location on Orchard Street just near the Somerset MRT station. I went in because of the large line of people extending out to the side walk. The wait wasn't too long - only 5-10 minutes. The ice-cream/addons mixtures look better than they taste. I had the "mud pie" which was nice, a would try others before giving my final and definite verdict.
