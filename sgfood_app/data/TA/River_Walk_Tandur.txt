The place is nice. Offers buffet as well as ala carte.Bit more expensive than taste of India nearby. Space is also limited. On our visit a insurance company was hosting a buffet lunch for delegates. So buffet was crowded. But we're seated in a table and our order reached within reasonable time. Two non alcoholic drink, dal,rice,chicken cost around 60 dollar's

Honestly, this place looks from outside and inside like from a Bollywood movie, purely indian. When I passed by with a hungry tummy I saw only indians sitting inside. But since I am an immigrant myself I tend to like places like these and had to go in. Seated immediately and asked if I like Buffet or menu. I chose menu, big mistake...buffet looked excellent and the menu food came right out of buffet too. So we ate chicken tandoori and lady fingers, which is okra vegetables in an oily tomato sauce. My chicken was very spicy and so I had to neutralize it with Mango Lassi, which was most excellent, too. The naan bread I ordered was to die for, dipped into tandoori sauce or the other, very delicious!Restaurant wasn't full, I went there late just before they closed. Air conditioned and the waiter sat down and ate from buffet too when we left, that's a very good sign ;-

The food and service is OK, the location is in little India near to Mustafa Shopping center. The buffet is decent enough for vegetarians as well as non vegetarian people. Just be careful with the timing as many groups come here for meal's which makes it very loud

we were a group of doctors with family on a tour to singapore, we happened to go to this restaurant for lunch on 19 June 2015 after leaving the Star Cruise Gemini, on first impression the aura and food were good, then suddenly the airconditioning stopped working, on equiring we were told our time is over and so the AC's have been switched off, and before we realised the food was taken off the buffet table.Singapore is such a friendly place, i visited once with my challenged son and beleive me even today i praise the citizens for their concern and manners, THIS WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. SO PLEASE RECONSIDER IF YOU ARE VISITING RIVER WALK TANDOOR.On telling the Manager that we would put this behavior on Trip Advisor, he Ashvini Kumar said... go ahead I dont care.:((((

It was a simple Indian buffet with vegetarian options. I am surprised to see the restaurant full. Even at 9pm, there was 2 groups of 10 coming in. It was a good place to eat Indian food without the full menu and yet we all over ate. It is also very close to MRT

Went on a makemytrip package to Singapore and one of the dinner as per their itinerary was at this restaurant.Apart from the location and frontage everything about this place is wrong.Food quality is ok.Firstly we were not given a proper table and were asked to occupy a table just at the entrance as the waiter said that all other tables were reserved. ( we were there till 2230hrs but nobody occupied those tables).Secondly, the chat amongst the staff was so loud and insulting saying that these guys are from group package. The waiters at service on asking water, filled in a plastic jug and dumped it on our table whereas the regular customers were being served water by the waiters time and again in a proper decent metal jug and were been asked if they would like anything else unlike treating us rudely.Listen up guys!! If you don't respect your customers may it be customers from package or walk in then it's better you learn some manners. Yes, I was on package but I paid for that meal to my travel vendor(makemytrip) who in turn paid it to you guys.A tip off for makemytrip guys that before suggesting or putting up any restaurants in their itinerary , you should go and taste their food and ask them to treat your guests as theirs and not disrespect them

The location is just perfectly located outside Farrer Park MRT. We opted for the Buffet option which was priced at 22 SGD. the menu was elaborate with veg and non veg dishes. The Taste and presentation was authentic Indian. and was worth every rupee spent there.Remember they close their dinner early at 10.30 pm and by 11.15 pm they are closed out. if you want to enjoy good food there be there early
