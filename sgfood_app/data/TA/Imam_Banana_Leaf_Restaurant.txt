We ate here our 1st night in Singapore. Our flight was a late evening flight and our food options in the area were limited. This restaurant is a 24 hour restaurant and when we got there at 10:30pm it was still a very busy restaurant. Service was quick, even with only limited seating options which is a testament to their staff. The juice options were plenty, and their meal options were typical banana leaf, plus western, plus thai foods. There was something here for everyone.The food we ordered was mutton curry banana leaf and 4 different Dosai/prata rotis. For our tastes the mutton was too spicy, but we are a family that doesn't like too spicy, so this is not the fault of the restaurant. The Dosai/Prata rotis were very nice, but cold by the time we got them. At the time I wasn't sure if they were meant to be served cold but at lunch the next day we ordered the same thing from a different restaurant and they were hot, so it could be this place serves them cold and that could be normal - we don't know. I have rated only a 4 as even though there were signs and stickers on the table - NO SMOKING inside, many people still smoking inside. Staffs didn't seem to notice or care. The food was good, the price was very good but eating inside and having to choke on cigarette smoke was disgusting

Please note the address here on trip advisor is WRONG. The correct address is Lor 1 Geylang - across from the MRT station. We had the chicken biryani. Yummo! So good. Also the breads were very nice. I ordered the rose syrup drink but it was too sickly sweet for me. My husband had a fresh coconut and also curry puffs. For $15 this was a cheap and easy meal. The food came quickly and there were lots of locals.

This is my go-to for Roti Prata and it is cheap and authentic. It's good quality and not touristy at all. The Egg and Onion Roti is my favourite along with the ginger tea. Definitely worth dropping in if you happen to be in the neighbourhood

Came here for lunch on a weekday - not crowded, but very hot! Portions are more than decent. If you're super hungry, lots of rice in the chicken briyani! No sides except for some pieces of cucumber and pineapple, so do order your vegetables separately! Good value for sure, 2 chicken briyani, 1 extra fried chicken, 1 extra vegetables, 2 teh halia, 1 teh tarik = $20.50. Taste is not bad, definitely value for money

Found this place as we were staying near by. The food is very good for the price. My boyfriend and I had various items off the menu including prata, chicken curry and chicken murtabak all of which were delicious. All of this plus drinks came to $16. We will be back

Third visit now. The place remains a little rough around the edges including the service.Chicken biryani is deginitely the stand out dish...rice fragrant and fluffy. So delicious! Other dishes we tried this visit and in the past were a little disappointing.Rating of four is purely for the biryani only. I'll be back next visit to Singapore

So far I sat inside the outlet which can be quite stuffy and at table placed on the pavements next to the road and I have not sit at tables at the back alleys, though.Food wise, the quality is acceptable and an ideal place to have a bite for those heading to or making out from the Sports Hu

We had one thai noodle meal and one indian curry chicken meal. We also ordered naan-bread (highly recommend!!). The food was worth of the money and they brought it under no time. I would eat there again.

I usually buy karipaps from Imam when I am nearby. Their karipap, along with their sauce, is simply fantastic. A definite thumbs up.

Fantastic Indian food. Been there since 1974. Definitely worth a visit on a stop over, easy to take train from airport. A Gem in Singapore ðŸ˜„

It was near Kallang MRT Station, just across the street. And beside Jalan Sultan Prawn Mee.Biryani rice was fragrance and fluffier. Prata bread and the curry were great too. And it was cheaper compared to other Indian restaurants I have ever visited. Don't forget to the the pineapple drink.The staffs were helpful and friendly

The chicken Marsala dish is amazing. Served on a fresh banana leaf as a serving plate there are several spicy condiments added around the edge with a large bowl of chicken Marsala on the side. The freshly squeezed lime juice as a palate cleanser refresh en's each mouthful to re-enjoy a re-mix of tasty condiments - just delightful. Recommend a fresh and crisp white wine as a sipper to top the whole meal off.

We came here for dinner and both really enjoyed our food. You get a big portion of rice, curry and poppadom on a banana leaf. I am vegetarian, so there wasn't much choice for me, but they did rustle up some veggie curry and dhal which was delicious! We were both very full afterwards.The place is basic but pretty busy and does good, authentic Indian food. We paid 12.50 SGD for a vegetarian banana leaf meal and one with fish, as well as a fresh watermelon juice (they do a number of juices). Close to Kallang MRT

If you have got bored of having sandwiches, burgers etc. this is a nice joint to have variety of Indian cuisine. This place is close to Kallang MRT and is open till wee hours, Food is reasonably good and moderately priced. E.g. Plain Paratha would cost you 1 SGD and a good meal will not burn hole in your pocket

Love the curry gravy, very tasty but the spices were not overpowering. Though for Indonesians like me and my husband, we like our food to be very hot, so we brought our own chilli flakes to sprinkle on the top of the mountain full of rice. The given amount of the meat is quite big as well.We ordered briyani with chicken. Each portion comes with 1 papadam, that I love very much. I ended up ordering 1 packet of papadam that has 4 pieces inside it.The restaurant is open all day

This unassuming restaurant is right near Kallang MRT. You can see it from the platform coming from Pasar Ris way.The chicken biryani was absolutely delicious-the best I've eaten. It deserves a score of 5. The vegetable dishes we had-especially the potato one- were also delicious.We ordered curry prawns as well, which were a little disappointing in flavour and not heated enough.On my next visit to Singapore, I'll be back there for more Biryani for sure

One of the best in Singapore! Every dish is mouth watering and flavorful. The rice is soft n fluffy and most importantly hot. Sambal egg is not spicy n it's so nice. You don't have to pour curry on your rice coz all these dishes is already more than enough to taste each of the flavor: would definitely drop by again to try the Crispy fried chicken and other of their mouth watering dishes
