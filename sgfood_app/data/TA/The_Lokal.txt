great thanks from me and my wife:) it was amazing Valentine's Day there! hope, see you soon and try new dishes
5
Went here for brunch with a few friends and it was really crowded but staffs were very attentive and served our food w/o any delay. Excellent food and service.
4
Food was good but portions is small, great for ladies and not so hungry moments. Service is satisfactory and friendly.
4
Good atmosphere! Must try their specials! It’s pretty quaint and remember to come early to get inside seating
4
Not my first time here, so its strengths and weaknesses remain - food is still good, but a bit pricey (mains are above SGD20, and servings are not huge), and the menu has not changed and remains a bit limited in selection. Still recommended though!
3
food was not too bad. nice atmosphere, service was quite good though we waited for awhile to get a seat and get the bill.
5
We like the Lokal restaurant. We will like it even more from today. We ordered the pumpkin salad. The pumpkin was not cooked enough. The place was crowded for CNY. They had to cook more than expected. We told them. They checked and agreed. They discounted the pumpkin salad from our bill. We were impressed by the services quality. We will definitely come back!Burger was good and the rest of the pumpkin salade was nice
5
The set menu for Valentines Day dinner was just gorgeous. The wines that went with each course were carefully chosen and delicious. The staff were knowledgable about what they were serving and were discreet. I think the value for money was outstanding. I eat here a lot and the food has never let me down
4
Must visit for a healthy salad or some great home made juice or teas, or how about your breakfast with eggs? Ive tried many different and never disappointed. Its a place to return to, including bringing friends, breakfast meeting or lunch. I like the relaxed vibe to this place, and the service is friendly and helpful. When the place if full, they try their best to help accommodate your needs
5
Once I find something that I love at a resto I just can't help but keep going back for more. I simply adore the beet root smoked salmon soba noodles dish. It's chilled, refreshing and filling at the same time. Also, the Lokal is just a cool hang out spot. I tend to bump into friends there. Can't wait to come back again
4
Over the last few years, this has always been a great go-to place - especially for lunch.
It's in a great little foodie-area and the staff are always very welcoming and friendly. As for the food... i've yet to have anything that isn't yummy.
3
Heard a lot about this place but after waiting half an hour for the food to be served we realized it was only average. The service was really good though!
4
It’s my breakfast place, meeting place and workplace during weekdays. The food is always good. Pretty homely and value for money.
5
The food is not bad but find the review done by people is abit too exaggerate.
If you looking for cafe to fill your tummy needs, this cafe wont disappoint you.
4
Had a good dinner with family at The Lokal. Attentive staff with timely arrival of orders. Swing by for a lovely and yummy evening!
5
Was with a bunch of friends on a weekday. It's my second visit to this place and the quality of food is as good as I last recalled, consistency is good!!
5
Smaller cafe with weekend brunch. Little waiting time. Great food, fresh juices, and nice atmosphere withbopen kitchen and really attentive staff.
5
It's a great family brunch place that we go to almost once every 2-3 weeks. Best service in Singapore! My husband was looking for free range chicken and grass fed beef and asked innumerable questions to ensure the source of the food was ethical and the server was extremely responsive and supportive. Made multiple trips to the kitchen to get the answers that we were looking for! We've gotten the roasted pumpkin salad, the eggs, the roast beef sandwich, the fries and they're excellent. Their coffee and juices are superb as well. They have managed to maintain their quality over the last few years, which is remarkable for Singapore.Only downsides are that their menu is standard and therefore not extensive choice for vegetarian who doesn't eat egg (which is what I am). And more often than not, for weekend brunch we have to wait for a table
5
The food is really tasty too :)Highly recommend the Lokal Ricotta and the Banana Bread (with homemade vanilla yoghurt).The staff is super friendly and the service is very fast. As a regular they’ll make you feel right at home.You might need to queue in the weekends for breakfast/brunch. But it’s definitely worth the wait.
3
Had lunch at The lokal on a weekday and it was quote pack. Had their beef burger and pancakes. Beef burger was pretty decent however pancake was a lil disappointing as it was quite dense. Coffee was alright just slightly acidic. Would say it’s decent but not superb
5
Great contrast of flavours. Love the pumpkin, quinoa, pine nuts and cranberries.
A bowl of sunshine that never fail to cheer me up. Service staff is always warm and accomodating too
<3 <3
3
Food was average in terms of taste, I had the chef special Venison Loin, thought the meat was rather bland, but salad was amazing. Otherwise, service was really slow, waited for around 20mins for appetiser to be served. Not the best dining experience.
5
Ordered 2 mains and 2 drinks.
They came relatively quick, didnt have to wait long for it. There wasnt too much noise, so conversations can be done with ease
5
Great service, great atmosphere and more importantly great food. We had the hamburger, truffle chips and the smashed avocado with homemade ricotta, faultlessly perfect! Not too far from the china town train stop. We would highly recommend this restaurant for brunch!
2
Out of five of us, two had eggs and we both had stomach problems after. One of the drinks was repeatedly confused with some other drink and caused delay to our order.
5
Been there for both brunch and dinner, never had a disappointing dish. For brunch, I would recommend Pimp My Breakfast, there's a large selection of everything you can choose to build your own breakfast, and it's always filling and value for money. For dinner, Grilled Pork Chop is absolutely delicious! The portions here are always generous. Service is great too, nice and friendly. Definitely a restaurant to come back to over and over again!
4
Came here with my friends for the first time. The ambience is good, and the staff are friendly. The food comes in generous portions too! Just way too much for me to finish it on my own. I'd recommend the 3-way cauliflower appetitser - it's an interesting dish. The burrata's great too. A little pricey in my opinion but it's definitely worth a visit
4
Decided to pop by because we were around the area. Was there for drinks and desserts. We ordered the sticky date pudding and it is one of the best we've had. The vanilla ice cream paired with it is also made with real vanilla pods â€” great topping to the dessert
4
Booked the place for Christmas eve dinner and the restaurant was having Sunday Roast Dinner. There was 3 different dining slots for dinner. I selected the earliest which was 5.30pm and the 2 of us were given the kitchen counter seats where we had a great view of happening in the busy place. Sitting next to us was the head chef's mother who shared with us who was visiting Singapore. Watching the kitchen, I realized the roasted turkey was faster than one usually expected.We started the meal with Pork Terrine (S$15++)Served with homemade pickles and clementine jamThe light crispy toaste, spread with the chunky terrine, and topped with some pickles such as onion, and beetroot, quite peaked up the appetite. Beetroot & Gin Cured Salmon (S$15++)Served with cucumber potato salad and herb mayonnaiseThe salmon tasted just like sashimi that one would not felt that it was cured version.The meal was followed by huge serving of main courses. Roast Beef (S$25++)Served with sides of red cabbage, buttered green beans, duck fat fried potato, and bread sauceWhile the meat looked rather raw, it sliced easily and tasted delicious. The sides were good too, except for the bread sauce which one felt it was too starchy.Roast Turkey ( S$25++)Served with sides of red cabbage, buttered green beans, mashed potatoes , and gravyOne would thought that the meat would be rather tough and dry, but the version here was kind of juicy and went quite well with the light but flavourful gravy. Topped up with the well braised slightly sweet cabbage, it tasted even better.Accompanied with Christmas stuffing (S$3++)Pork mince, pine nuts and thyme.I was not a fan of christmas stuffing as I always felt it was rather strong in herbs taste. The version was more like meat loaf with a bit of nutty texture.Ended the meal with a couple of Christmas cookies topped with cream cheese topping, complimentary from the chef
4
Ordered the fish and chips which was pretty good in terms of taste, portion and thus a good value for money. Starters wise the hokkaido scallop was quite a let down. One single piece that was sliced into 3, almost tasteless and over-powered by the accompany sauce and grossly overpriced in my opinion. Lucky they had macadamia nuts and avocado to at least save the dish. Location wise was pretty alright and service staff was friendly.
3
Went there for brunch, found the menu to be fairly limited. Decided to pimp my own breakfast. Ordered the roast beef which came out more like blanched beef and it was very gamy. Plate was not seasoned and experience was just overall underwhelming.
4
My second time there, food is much better this time round. We had the lamb 3 way and the linguine. Would totally checking out this place.
5
My wife and I had a great breakfast at The Lokal. The food was great and flavorful. We will definitely go back again!
4
Food was overall good. Appetizer portions were slightly on the smaller side - good for 2 to share, but not for bigger groups.
One of the wait staff was a little surly, but the others made up for it.
2
First of all, seating arrangement is really bad & very cramp~ The waitress knocked into my chair several times while serving another table~ Food was a hit & miss~ The appetizers were to sour to my liking while the main courses was good~
4
good food, very good service. loved the pork chop. steak was on the other hand too smallish. loved this place and will be back
4
The staff was attentive and it was easy to get their attention. The food came quickly and it was good.
5
I always go for pimp my breakfast which gives you plenty of options. The homemade kaya with tinge of local flavour makes you feel homely.
5
I have never been disappointed at the local. Food is excellent and the service is casual, friendly and they are attentive. In addition, I like that they have an opinion when asked "what shall I order today?" Among the many good dishes, my favourite is still the Kale salad! Yummy
5
Serving lady, young Filipino, recommended & took orders with warmth, patience & enthusiasm.She personally brought on a lovely decoration in a birthday presentation for our dessert order. She even offered to lend me a pair of sandals when she noticed my broken sandals as i limped around the restaurant, with which she said i could return any time convenient! Well done, Lokal with excellent service staff. And i have not even yet mention that I enjoyed 50% discount for my bill because I had bought Lokal vouchers on a Chope Flash Sale! Thank you Chope
4
The portion of the foods are not really big. But, it was good. Desserts were slightly too sweet fo us. Good service indeed!
4
As the title suggests, the food is really good. I had the toasties of the day and the fruit juice of the day. Both are great! The ambience are great too. Definitely will come back again!
5
Great ambience. Service was friendly. Variety of beverage and food. Spoilt for choice! Food looks good and tastes great!
5
We go to Lokal quite regularly for brunch in the weekend and finally managed to come for dinner. The food was amazing and decent portion and amazing service as usual.
5
The restaurant provides Aussie and Local brunch menus like sandwiches and kaya toasts, etc.
Food is nice, drinks are nice, perfect choice for your brunch.
Servers are all friendly as well.
5
staffs were attentive and food is not bad, only thing is that the food is not warm enough , probably because we are sitting under the fan.

I was in Tanjong Pagar area for business last week when I decided to take a coffee break with a slice of cake. I passed by the cafe as I was still deciding where to settle down and what caught my eye was their menu next to their entrance. The decor looks rustic and although the menu did not have dessert section, I figured a place that served a range of western brunch and lunch items would have some sweets. I walked into the restaurant and there was no staff to greet but only a bartender who was in conversation with one of their patrons. He looked at me and I asked if they served cakes with coffee. He starred blankly at me for a moment, looked at his bar area (possibly in search of cake), checked with another staff if they have cafe, looked back at me and said no. He just continued to stand in position, looking at me like I had interrupted his conversation and his daily routine.Whatever interest I have in trying a cafe/restaurant is immediately flushed away when I realise their staff doesn't know much (or anything) about their menu. There was not effort in convincing me to try other options on their menu, or trying to fix something up. I ended up going to Populus (just next door) for my cake and coffee, and the service there was much better
5
The lokal gives you a relaxed and comfortable vibe from the minute you step inside. The staff greeted us with big smiles and great service. Each item on our plate for breakfast was fresh, cooked to perfection and tasty! The cappuccinos were also beautiful.The lokal ended up being our cafe of choice multiple mornings while we were in Singapore.
4
My visit to the Lo Kal was a surprise altogether.Situated close to my German class sessions,hungry,I paid a visit.The interior decor was amazing,with sublime details done with detail.The waiters and staff are well trained.They ate happy to get suggestions.Menu card is neat with details about the items,but I found that a small photo of the dishes can be added.I had ordered for Cauliflower three way and truffle fries.The food was served within 15mins.The server explained in detail about the dish.The cauliflower three way was commendable but the fries let me down.I expected truffle mushrooms.Morover they had excess oil.This could be improved.i ended up paying 27$ which is on the higher side of the price range
4
Like the cosy place and good brunch that The Lokal serve. I had the Black Pig 2.0 and apart from the burst sunny side up, the pork belly was good! Yummy. The place can get very crowded during weekend brunch and no reservations allowed. Hence, good to go early to minimise queue
3
Came back here for another lunch this week. We both opted for the beef burger which came with fries. The burger was really quite decent, but the fries were way too oily and left an unpleasant taste. Service was really friendly.
5
The Lokal team delivers a friendly feast every time. The roast dinner special menu was delicious and very affordable. The best part is the team who really do welcome you and attend to you so well.
4
Location was central and not too difficult to find. Food was tasty. Especially the pork chop was great. Recommended to try that
4
The mains we ordered were delicious - the steak frites, pork chop and fish & chips. particularly enjoyed the chicken liver parfait with toast as well! will return!
4
Friendly ambience every time we arrive, interesting choices of food & drink resulting in a delicious meal.
5
Always look forward the daily special like different flavours of muffins, toasties or soup. A great Aussie cafe.
5
Honestly I was expecting only decent food, but I was rewarded with superb, delicious food. I had the pork chop on the recommendation of the friendly waiter and it was AMAZING. Few places these days leave me saying with certainty that I'll be back. This I one of them just because the food is so good. The ale was fresh and tasty as well! The only thing I personally felt could be improved was the atmosphere, otherwise well worth a visit for the food alone.
4
We are in Singapore for a board meeting and a wedding. The meeting is in Chinatown. So the hotel is well located. A short walk away is The Lokal. Interesting food, we arrived late on our flight from Canada and had fish and chips. Really good. I wasnâ€™t so keen on the hoppy NZ BEER. we had breakfast here in the mornings. Great avocado and poached eggs with sourdough. Good coffee. And very welcoming staff
5
After traveling for 5 weeks we had our last dinner overseas at The Lokal and it was perfect! Lovely space, great staff and perfectly cooked meats with tasty salads. I loved my pork chop served with a kale, apple and walnut salad. The fish and (sweet potato) chips with a lightly pickled cucumber and dipping sauce was spot on and the steaks were to die for. The kids demolished their perfectly cooked medium rare steaks served with heaps of hand cut potato chips and salad. We shared 3 desserts between the 5 of us- two served of the sticky date pudding with caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream and 3 scoops of ice cream. Delicious and so filling! We returned for a late brunch the next day after a jet lagged sleep in and Lokal didn't disappoint- buttermilk pancakes, steak and eggs, smoothies and a pimp your breakfast combo of poached eggs, avocado mash and baked beans was perfect to set us on our way. Brunch included a 15% discount as we were staying at the Dorsett just down the road. Great food, service and music - we loved it!
4
It has been a great day to have a simply and cozy lunch with my colleagues in the Lokal. The waiter and waitress serving us and bringing us to our table is polite. They are very patient with us asking for recommendation on the food. Thank you. The food is well presented with a tint of creativity. Thank you. Amazing to end off with the sweet dessert.
4
The chef made sure different ingredients are incorporated into the same dish to create a multitude of interesting flavours. Enjoyed the Cauliflower in three ways, Lamb in three ways and the Frozen Cappuccino for dessert.
5
Good food and attentive service . The steak and fries were cooked to perfection . Fish and chips were tasty and crispy . Love the cosy ambience! Will come back soon
4
Made a reservation via the Chope application for a post birthday celebration with friends and the team managed to accomodate my change in reservation timing after I realised that I could get off work a lot earlier.We ordered the Hokkaido Scallop Ceviche, The Lokal Fish & Chips, Slipper Lobster Linguine and the Cape Grim Beef Tagliata. Overall we thought that the food was really good, especially with such a casual setting - but the Ceviche was absolutely amazing. I loved it so much, that despite it having been a week since my visit, I am still thinking about it. The price point was just right as well and I would definitely be back
5
I thought this would just be another hipster joint to check out, but the food blew me away. We ordered the Stingray appetizer which was interestingly refreshing, and the Lamb and Porkchop as mains. The mains were fantastic. I'd recommend. Be sure to make a reservation before hand
4
Located just at the corner of Bukit Pasoh, The Lokal serves a general range of coffee, teas, fresh juices and smoothies. An ideal chillout place for small cliques or even if you have a business discussion. Desserts on the menu are interesting and its all tasty! Got to order the truffle fries too! Would come back here for desserts again
1
I was a big fan of lokal but my recent visit was so disappointing. The crab pasta I ordered was bland - they clearly used frozen crab meat and it was like lukewarm. The beef sandwich my friend ordered was also rather bland and just doesn't taste very good. It felt like they had a kitchen and staff makeover recently. Their coffee is still great though. real shame
5
Located at a corner classical shophouse with great interiors. Entrance was inviting although would suggest to reserve in advance as it was pretty crowded. Had the pancakes with strawberries and it tasted absolutely delicious!! So much so I would have had a second round. The truffle fries were nice and crispy which was much appreciated. Had an orange juice as the beverage which was in a large cup but sadly from a pasteurised package as opposed to a fresh batch. Overall, the food was of good quality and would definitely make a trip back again for the pancakes.
5
Reservation was easy to make on Chope app. Table was ready when I arrived early. The waiter was splendid with his recommendations and attitude. Ordered starters and several mains to share around with my family, the waiter offered to provide a change of knives since we were having steak and gave us personal plates for our food. The taste of the food was great, loved the lobster linguine and the cauliflower 3 ways
4
Their catch of the day menu never fails to disappoint me. The chef has the impeccable ability to bring forward amazing dishes of the right balance of flavours. As there is a change in their everyday menu, I found myself with fewer choices to order since their mains comprised mainly of beef dishes. I do hope that they will incorporate more variety into their menu.
5
Chanced upon this place after a short search on the internet after realising my initial restaurant choice was closed that day. All I can say is that it was a blessing in disguise. Had the cauliflower 3-ways, lamb 3-ways and Pork Chop. All of them were exceptional, the portion was enough, and they have a 1-for-1 entertainer app promo for main course so really nothing to complain about! The restaurant's atmosphere is pretty relaxed and cozy as well, and the service was excellent! Well Done
5
When you want to get something special yet comfort, this is the go-to place. I do prefer chef Darren 's cooking.
5
Great place and good ambiance, food is good. love the finger foods there. great to ask for recommendation from the waitress
5
Grilled pork chop with generous portion of kale salad FOR THE WIN! I enjoyed the kale salad so much! Their pork chop complemented the salad very well.
4
The staffs were friendly, helpful and polite. Dinner menu was so-so...brunch food looks good, will come back for brunch again!
5
Absolutely love everything.... From great service , food and ambience!!! Will definitely come back :)
4
Food was good even though the waiting time was quite long.
The staffs were quite attentive. Will visit again in the future
4
We ordered Fish & Chips and Pork Chop. They were served in a different way as compared to other restaurants. Can tell the quality of food is way different and very yummy! The sauce for the fish & chip complements the dish well and it is actually quite filling! Service was also good.
5
A few doors down from the popular The Populus. Not quite local cuisine, since it's supposedly Australian, in ingredients and style. Their menu is not extensive and can be expensive but the food we tried were good. Tried beef tagliata for the first time - think sliced roast beef but still medium raw in the centre. Was so fragrant and juicy it was heavenly! Drizzled with grated cheese and watercress. Pork chop was very well done - also flavourful and not overcooked. Also came with salad vegetables and even a few slices of apples. I might be back next time to try other dishes. The service was also fantastic - bravo! And bonus: can pay with Mileslife app, to more earn miles on the bill
4
Visited the place for dinner. Comparing to brunch, the place was relatively quiet and gave off a cosy feel. Besides the usual menu, there was also today's special for its starter, catch of the day, main, juice of the day and cocktail special - South Side ($17++).Juice of the Day ($8++)Carrot, celery, green apple, kale and limeServed in a glass, it was in shades of dirty orange, but tasted refreshing and naturally sweet.Starter of the Day ($18.50++)Burrata with pickled white peach and mintThe burrata was rich and creamy, served with the sweet and juicy peach. What a combination.Pork Chop ($28++)Apples, green beans, kale and walnut saladI was surprised by the huge serving, especially the large huge amount of greens on the plate. It was about half of the plate. The pork chop was sliced into strips which made it easy to handle for chewing. The pork chop was juicy and without any porky taste. The salad was lightly dressed and quite tasty but the serving was a bit too much for one.Great service from the staff who often came around to check
3
I had a decent flat white and mortadella sandwich. Wondered belatedly if I should have had the ricotta and avo sandwich. I felt that the brunch options were a tad limited and the dinner options looked more enticing. The decor was lovely with a range of books including recipe books and La Kopi for browsing purposes
5
Lovely place. Service was amazing,
Super attentive and friendly. food was yummy:)) the pork n lamb is really delicious... we had so much fun and laugh there. The staff and chefs with excellent. Good presentation and portions was very good.
4
We had made a booking for 12.15, but the waiters were so kind to hold the table till 12.50 when I had called to push it back, and again till 1.10 when I had detoured the entire CBD after a wrong turn!!!
5
I am definitely one of the regulars now. Settled 2 out of 3 meals of a day sometimes. Friendly people, humble food. I love all.
5
A place with great ambience and awesome food. The restaurant always have different catch of the day which gave us inspirations on what to have for dinner. A must visit!
5
What a nice place to get your breakfast!! This is how it needs to be done. Nice food, friendly staff and cosy interior.
4
A little pricey, but exceptional food, great coffee, and good service in a cool, urban interior, with sharing tables for busy times.
5
food took some time to arrive but it was pretty good. had the pork chop which was excellent with the kale and walnuts. also had the pear and pumpkin salad. went on a saturday night and the crowd was close to zero although it looked like some tables had been reserved. server was courteous and attentiv
5
A lively atmosphere for a comfortable dinner with friends. Plenty of menu pickings. We had the steak, which did not come cheap but was worth every cent; the lobster linguine, done perfectly with a good quantity of plump lobsters; pork chop with kale and pear salad, which i absolutely loved. I must commend the restaurant on the kale salad, it was delicious! I love my greens, and can never understand why so many restaurants give a measly portion of greens, and very much appreciated that the Lokal was generous with the salads. On top of everything, service was excellent. Will be back
5
The male service staff who was on shift on 4 July 2017 dinner time has provided us with excellent service. (sorry that I have forgotten his name). He was attentive and polite. The food were great too. Pork chop was tender, fish & chips was not coated with thick batter and slipper lobster pasta was overloaded with slipper lobster. Price is slightly steep though.
5
I visited The Lokal during my last business trip. It has a great decoration and music. The food was great as well as coffee. The Smoked Fish Platter is the must (available during the weekend). Also Kale Cesar Salad. The shake is also good and not too sweet. Great place. No complain
4
Cool Aussie style cafe serving delicious cafe style fair. Great coffee, service was efficient and friendly. Good portions and great taste.
Winner !
4
Food was great and portions were pretty large. It was pretty crowded on a weekday night though, so it was a little difficult to get the attention of the waiters.
4
Checkout their Instagram for the daily special. It's just like a little surprise sometimes to have a special muffin or toast. Love it.
4
Great generous portions reminds me of good old days when i used to study in Australia. Great pork chop:) The waiting time for food was a little long for a wednesday night, my only gripe!
4
Food was nice however the waiting time for food was rather long. Take note there is a cakeage charge of $20 if you planning to bring own cakes, cut and eat in the cafe.
5
The food was great and excellent service. The staff are attentive and friendly. Worth trying . Weekends are busier and have to wait for your seats
5
Went for family breaki on the weekend, and it didn't disappoint! Their home made ricotta (w smashed avo on toast) was the bomb!... possibly best to ricotta I've eaten! And the Sour dough was real sour dough !!..so crunchy and tasty. Coffee was just perfect too. Kids all loved their meals- banana bread tick, bacon on toast tick, and hubby's eggs w house cured smoked salmon was a major hit- the salmon melted in mouth, beautifully cured!! Would highly recommend !
4
We had dinner on a weekday at The Lokal cafe and ordered a grilled pork chop and fish and chips. The sweet potato chips that came with the fish and chips was yummy. The pork was quite fatty, but the kale salad and walnuts was really delicious
4
I was glad I decided to try The Lokal for an early dinner as I have been avoiding it because there's always a queue at weekends for brunch and lunch. I was greeted with a charming smile and service.The Hokkaido scallops was beautiful. It was generously drenched with a flavoursome dressing and served on a bed of fresh avocado slices and macademia nuts sprinkled around it. Definitely must try again. The slipper lobster linguine was a perfect al dente' and also a generous serving of fresh lobster slices. It was very tasty.The drinks and wine menu seemed okay. It was great that the prosecco was served in a nicely chilled glass. The service was friendly and polite. Definitely will be back but probably not at weekends for brunch
5
Went with a friend for dinner at the lokal for the first time and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. The service was impeccable. And the large serving size was a pleasant surprise. Not to mention, the food was delicious. The steak we ordered was cooked to perfection. Overall, a great night all thanks to the team at the Lokal!
5
Delicious as always! This was my third time here and i'm still impressed with the food served, great service to boot!
5
Fast wifi! Averaging 30 mbps for download and 60-95 mbps for upload! Friendly staff. Sockets available close to the entrance. 7+ SGD for the items. Well-lit, also dimmable if you sit in the back. Good for conversations, casual meetings and work.
5
The title says pretty much everything. Quite a western palette and busy environment. Air con and fans.
4
Came here for lunch today and used the Entertainer for 2 burgers. Quite a good discount but would have been expensive at full price. I was very happy with my burger: really tasty. Friendly and efficient service.
4
Friendly staff, nice ambience. Good location. Food is.......... OK. Not bad, but it's not so wow for me. Price is not bad also, considering the location.
3
The cafe was crowded for a Friday night. We had braised beef cheeks and pasta to share. It wasn't spectacular but it was okay. Perhaps the other dishes were better.
5
The restaurant is conveniently located near public transport. It has a nice atmosphere whereby you can catch up with friends. Service was good. Food is more on the expensive side. We ordered a few mains to share and some were a hit (pork chop and ribeye) and some were a miss (pasta and fish).
5
Came to know about this place through the Entertainer app but we have since ate here countless times! Great food for brunch, lunch and dinner and they have different menus so it keeps things different whenever we come back :) Reasonably priced and fresh delicious food all the time :
5
We went on a weekday morning for brunch and were surprise to see the cafe more than half filled. Waiters were friendly and prompt in showing us to our table. The ambience was cozy with home-styled decor. The menu items were a little on the pricier side however they were all very delicious. We ordered a pasta dish as well as steak and eggs. The portion for steak and eggs was small and i was surprised they didn't asked me for the doneness of the steak.
4
Ordered the Slipper Lobster Linguine, and it comes with generous amount of Lobster. Love the sauce that comes with it, simply wonderful. The other order was the Slow cooked beef cheek, portion of the beef is a little small, but it's so tender and good. Food is very good there
5
A place that you have the freedom to pimp what you like and no doubt, the food is good. The service is welcoming. A new place that I will go for. During lunchtime is quite crowded but not too bad.
3
The restaurant was nicely decorated and the service staff were nice. Food also came promptly and taste was good.
5
Went there for lunch and dinner with three others. Chose a range from the menu both times, with all meals being excellent, along with friendly competent service. Thanks team!
5
Awesome food and staff. Recommended some of the best dishes. Cosy though the cushion seats are abit low
5
Nice place for a quick lunch. Many choices, good food, quick service and smily waiters. We enjoyed it!
4
Came here with my family on a Saturday. Was decently packed so would advise to make a booking for 4 pax and above. Pork chop was the best dish out of our mains, the specialty of the day which was lamp chop was quite a disappointment. Roasted chicken was pretty good especially the potatoes cooked in duck fat, went well with the chicken and bring out the taste of the dish. Central location with bars and dessert places nearby.
5
Visited the lokal for dinner. Made reservations a week before. Had a good time there, the staff were super friendly and knowledgeable. We had the truffle fries and pork chop which was Super juicy and the salad that complimented was on point. Would really recommend this place to family and friends, and would definitely be back again.
4
The LoKal is a pretty popular brunch spot but my family decided to visit for dinner instead. We ordered the beef cheek, steak frites, LoKal fish and chips, and the daily special which was cod if I remember correctly. The beef cheek was so tender I could cut and eat it with just a spoon. It was very flavourful too. The daily special of fish really impressed my mum. It was pretty good value - a good steak of fish and quite a number of clams in garlic vinaigrette (and what tasted like) white wine sauce. My sister was a little disappointed with the fish and chips though, because she felt there wasn't much difference between the grouper fish The Lokal used and fish and chips you'd find in any other restaurant. We ordered the two desserts on the menu, which were sticky date pudding and chocolate rum mousse. Admittedly, it was my first time having sticky date pudding so I have nothing to compare this to but it was stunning. Even my dad exclaimed about how tasty it was and he hardly ever does that. The warm cake has a thin crunchy layer of caramelisation on its exterior which added texture. Its denseness and flavour is just right so the cake is substantial without being overwhelming. With gooey caramel sauce and contrasted with the cold, vanilla ice-cream speckled with vanilla beans, we were completely blown away by this dessert. A must order for certain.

The Lokal has literally been the local for me for years now. I work in the vicinity and would usually grab a coffee during the day or have a quick dinner after work. On the weekends I find myself going back for brunch! Chef Darren, Max and team are flexible enough to cater to my dietary requirements which is very much appreciated. Never used to like pork chops and needless to say kale salad. The Lokal has definitely taken me by surprise. The pork chops are super flavourful and juicy. And the kale salad with walnuts and green apples is not to be missed. I'm getting hungry as I'm writing this review. Need to go back again this coming week!!!

Been awhile since my last review and we went over together with some friends from Norway. We went for dinner. We shared starters and asked them to recommend few. Was very good. After we shared steak and pork chop. Both are amazing, and the pork chop is the best I ever had. Their wines are good and fair priced. Food is very reasonable priced and quality the beat.Thanks to Max and the rest of the staff of The Lokal! We will be back soon
4
We popped in ordered our food and we're very quickly being served by the staff.
Food was good and service was flexible in changing my initial table of two to four. They had a myriad of drinks too and the atmosphere was chirpy and friendly.
5
Delightfully nice visit. Nice ambience and staff are great.
Would recommend friends to visit and would love to come back
3
Nice ambience, quiet and good vibes all around! Coffee is not bad, food as well and reasonably priced.
4
Venue a little hard to find, but the food and service are good! Love their lobster linguine and truffle fries. But it's a bit pricey.
4
Visited this place on a Saturday night. 830pm.
Place was slowly winding down. Ordered the steak, Caesar salad and draft Irish ale.
Wait staff was attentive and prompt. No complaints. Was a little noisy due to children talking loudly for abit.
5
Food was good !! Big portion . Good place to chill with friends. Place was filled with people. Very lively
4
Very nice coffee and atmosphere, food is so-so, giving it many try but never found one that was perfect. Kept coming back for their coffee.
5
Lovely team and great food. We enjoyed ourselves, thanks lokal! Prices a little on high side but that tends to be the case in Singapore.
4
Cozy place, very good quality natural home made cuisine. A little pricey for portions but it's good tasting stuff
5
I've been here twice now and the food is pretty consistently good. I love finding that one dish that really hits the spot and I have to say the salmon soba noodles is my favorite. I've tasted the dishes that my friends order and they're okay too but somehow the salmon soba just seems much healthier. It's just so fresh and tasty too. I'll be back here as long as I have my entertainer deals... cuz they make the bill much easier on the eyes. Service is good here too, even when they're packed during lunch time.
4
received a warm welcome from the service staff . all dishes was prepared quite well and the mains came with interesting sides like kale salad and sweet potato fries. used the entertainer app for 1 for 1 mains
3
If you are looking for breakfast this is the place to be, the food is fresh and the service really good, but don't be surprised with your bill in the end!
4
Quite expensive for a backpacker but upmarket standard for Singapore. It was worth it for the delicious pumpkin salad and French toast. Very friendly and supportive service 👍🏽
4
The Lokal is easy to find and have great ambience.
I had medium rare sirloin tagligata steak for dinner and I like how its served with cheese and watercress, it's really good!
4
Went there by chance, but happily surprised by great tast and cosy atmosphere. Food, beer, service, everything came together and I recommend a visit.
4
Went there for dinner . Good value for money . Scallops Ceviche was fresh and good. Good place for a casual lunch or dinner.
5
Lobster Linguine is good!!!!! Overall satisfied with the food & staffs here! Will come back here again..... 😁
3
We were taken aback by the simple diner type menu with the fancy price tag, making us wonder how much we are paying for the locale rather than the food itself.
5
3rd time here and still I never seem to get tired of this favorite! As usual, food and service was imoeccable! Special mention goes to the Indian chap who went the extra mile to accede to my request and also for the small surprise to end off the pleasant dinner!
4
A really solid ambience. The lightings, the music and the mood was just right for me and my partner. We ordered the fat fries ( i think it comes with truffle oil and cheese shavings) and it came on a really huge plate. They gave us chilli and ketchup, but it was not those usual condiments and was some kind of a paste for both. As the amount of fries they served us was huge, we couldn't finish it. We already had dinner before so that was all we ate. We will be visiting next time and trying other food
5
The cafe has a cosy and relaxing ambience, a place to go if you need to let your hair down. The food is extremely satisfying and sumptuous! I will strongly recommend this place!
4
Plenty of options. The kaya toast came with good, thickly sliced bread and a soft poached egg. Good banana bread, avo on toast and Decent macchiato. Doesn't open till 8am.
4
The cafe was fully booked by 730pm on a Friday night. Apparently most tables were there to take advantage of the entertainer app but service remained efficient and cheerful! A good experience.
3
Had a dinner here with colleagues. Very nice presentation of food..huge serving. The mains has very limited selection though. I was very happy with my Catch of the Day order - a pan-fried sea bass that goes well with a pint of Bohemian Lager. They have daily promotion of $10/half a pint. Staff are very friendly and very helpful. Will definitely be back.
2
Customers were mainly Caucasians and foreigners on a weekday morning. Expect to share tables. Food was average and definitely not cheap. Service staff were ok but attitude of the Aussie owner certainly could improve. Perhaps because we were the only locals and didn't deserve a spot? Or because we had a one-for-one deal and didn't pay full price? Either way I certainly wouldn't be back
5
The staff were very friendly and helpful when my wife explained she is coeliac and couldnt eat gluten. They talked to the chef who identified a couple of options on the menu - fruit salad with yoghurt and chia for breakfast, and mackarel salad for lunch. Although they didnt have anything marked on the menu, we didnt get the usual blank look when we mentioned gluten that we got at most restaurants in Singapore.They served good Australian-style coffee, lots of other non-GF breakfast options (I liked the homemade Kaya toast), and were friendly when our baby wouldn't stop crying
5
The Lokal is our usual go to place for a mid week treat. Today, instead of our usual roast chicken (for first timers, this is a must have!) we went with the daily specials of Surf & Turf and grilled squid with heirloom tomatoes. Both were wonderfully delicious, succulent and fresh - It's really the norm at The Lokal to have great quality ingredients. They also did us a favor by swapping out mash for sweet potato fries which they should really make available as a side order cuz it's just scrumptious! On a diet so we didn't go for our de rigeur Sticky Date Pudding...but that's also a definite must have! Shout out to the crew especially Marc for the awesome service!
4
Excellent set up. Open kitchen. Attentive, friendly staff. Great 'Pimp my breakfast' menu really appeals to my Gluten Free sensibilities. Yoghurt & fruit were fresh & delicious. Poached eggs, smashed avocado & grilled tomatoes were delightful.Espresso topped it off and now I'm set for ANOTHER great day in Singapore
1
My daughter raves of this restaurant saying it's great for a breakfast, well on a recent visit my wife and I left there wondering what she's sees in the place. If I have toast anywhere in uk it comes with butter, not here 1$ for a thimble full, shocking! Waiting staff were incompetent, food came quick enough but scrambled eggs were under cooked and tasted horrible, paid extra for vegimite and extra toast and of course more butter. All in all not a great experienc
5
Loved Lokal. A local friend put me on to it and it was right next to my hotel. Great coffee, relaxed service and free wifi, As with a lot of cafes around Singapore, it doesn't open quite as early as you might hope, but also doubles as a place to have a drink late in the day with a great selection of craft beer etc. Definitely check it out.
5
Found this little gem wandering around lost looking for somewhere to eat. Busy but they found me somewhere at the bar immediately. Breakfast Burger was lush, along with the peanut butter smoothy. Will definitely be making this my Lokal!
4
Been there 3 times for dinner now and each time has been equally satisfactory. Food is great though pricey - hoping to try the brunch menu soon.
5
Coffee was really good - had just the right temperature, acidity, and texture. My Macchiato came with a free biscotti and they complemented each other very well. Service was good and fast. I will definitely come back.
5
We enjoy either brunch or dinner every week at the Lokal. Their food is amazing and their coffees great. For dinners I suggest to try some of their well made drinks. Their prices are reasonable and service is very good.
5
I visited The Lokal for dinner with my husband for his birthday, the dinner menu is great and there are always different special courses from the chef. We had a great fish and chips and the dessert is the best I have ever had in Singapore: dates pudding with vanilla ice cream delicious! The staff is nice and friendly, great service
5
Their butter is the best. And of course their food is great too. I always have roast chicken ciabatta and I'm in love with it. I'm leaving the country soon and I think their butter is one of the things I'll miss in Singapore. I'll sure come back one day in near future :
4
My friend and I were at the cafe next door the week before and noticed the crowd outside Lokal. On a whim, I decided to stop by for brunch. I know the vibe is supposed to be all Aussie, but this actually reminds me of the casual Hong Kong diner - well except more expensive. It wasn't that crowded when I went, and the place has a relaxed casual feel, especially as I was sitting at the communal table. The food was simple but good - a big plus for all those homemade yogurt and stuff. Coffee - not the best but more than good enough.Yes in a way it is like just another one of these hipster cafes, but somehow Lokal comes across as not-pretentious. It is the kind of place where I don't mind going back regularly, grab a bite and just chill for a while
3
This place has a long queue usually on weekends.The ambience is not bad. The food is hit and miss. The portions are small.Banana bread with yoghurt and macadamia was a hit. Burger was a miss.Sneakers bar was a hit. Muffin was a miss.So if I don't have to queue I don't mind eating here. But anything more than ten minutes is too long for its food
5
I walked in here on a whim, the sign on the door "made with love" drew me in. You can't go wrong with a little TLC. I chose a seat in front of the open kitchen and watched all night as these Ninjas concocted their wizard creations. The food was delicious, a testament to the chef.
4
Sited in a neighbourhood chock full of dining choices, the Lokal stands out for their food and genuine service. The sticky date pudding is a must try. It is so good that even my fiancÃ© who usually doesn't like this combination of tastes ended up having half of it, when the entire dish was supposed to be mine!
5
The Lokal is my local coffee shop. I normally end up here 3+ times each week, for breakfast bites, coffee and more. Chef Darren does a great mix of local and Australian cuisine, with kaya toast, cakes, and Vegemite all on show.
4
A great find, stumbled upon it on a recent SG visit. Great breakfast, lots of healthy options, friendly staff, love the concept. Will be back
4
Second time dining there for dinner and it didn't disappoint. Portions are substantial and it may be good to share mains.
4
Friendly staff and nice ambience. Able to chit chat with friends and enjoy the food. Overall satisfied with the visit!
4
Tried the bangers and mash today as a second lunch today. This was pretty decent, and service was efficient and friendly. The banana bread with yoghurt was also quite good. This place is worth another visit.
3
Foodwise - I'd give LoKal a 4-star rating. The Kampong Chicken was exceptional - juicy, tender and very flavourful. The waiter was also very friendly and helpful and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, not so for the reservations staff. I had a reservation for 5:30 pm (ie, NOT peak hour). When I was there, only 2 other tables were taken. So I can't understand why the reservations lady was so badgering - she called me 6 times in the afternoon in an attempt to confirm my table reservation but I could NOT take the call as I was engaged in a seminar. Hence, I specifically declined call each time. The lady can't take the hint and persisted to call me. She only stopped when I had to excuse myself from the seminar proceedings and called the missed call number to realize it was LoKal so desperate to confirm reservation at a non-peak hour. Duh
5
The menu may be simple with just a handful of choices, but everything we tried was done superbly well, even the humble mixed salad. We had the kampung chicken and steak frites as well as parmesan fries, scallop ceviche and a salad for starters, which was more than enough sufficient for the four of us. The sticky date pudding is to die for
4
Have been here a couple of times. Typically it's crowded, as it's small, but also popular. The second time I went they had run out of the dish I wanted, but recommended another one that I thoroughly enjoyed. Their menu is a nice mix of familiar flavours, sometimes with a twist. The decor is nice, and staff are helpful
4
Been here twice for breakfast, as I stayed at Dorsett hotel nearby. I ordered kaya toast and fruit salad. Both were very good and fresh. The coffee was also very nice, it was really making my day. Service was good and the staff were all friendly and helpful. I recommended this place if you are looking for alternative breakfast place near Chinatown
3
Took a trip to the Lokal for Sunday brunch after hearing raving reviews about its food. Did not hear too good things about the service but decided to give this place a try none the less.This cafe does not take reservation so upon arrival, I thanked my lucky starts that there was absolutely no queue. I went into the restaurant to ask the waitress for a table for 4 and she very gruffly replied, with a black face, that I had to register outside and wait for my ticket to be called to obtain a table. Ok no big deal, I went back outside to get a queue number. After punching in my particulars, my phone rang telling me a table was available. This was 1 sec after I punched in my details so my question is: if the table was available from the beginning, why did the waitress not give it to be from the start? Why did she make me go out to punch in my particulars and come back in again? I feel that that is so unnecessary. So I went back in and told the same waitress that my number had been called. With the same black face, she led me to the table. She also served us our food with a black face and everyone at my table felt very uncomfortable with her demeanor and attitude. The service is really one of the worst I have experienced.Thank goodness we had a different waitress, Wendy, to take our orders. She was patient and had a nice, cherry smile whilst serving us. The coffee was good. I had the iced flat white when I very munched enjoyed.The food was OK for the price, not bad but not excellent either.
5
Good atmosphere to spend some quiet time to wind down after a day's work with loved ones. Food was good and tasty.
5
Get their french toast. Not only is it mouth watering for brunch, their coffee gives a great kick too. Service is actually efficient and friendly.
5
Lovely surroundings and friendly staff. Nice and clean and well presented. I tried the local Kaya toast as it came highly recommended and it was delicious, as was the smashed avocado on toast. Would definitely recommend
4
Great find - great food, cool vibe, down-to-earth and not overly showy / try-hard / overpriced like we found many places to be in Singapore. Glad we hunted it down!
5
Spent the morning there with my friend for his birthday! Ate the French toast and banger and mash, both meals were delicious. Staff were also very friendly and attentive. Will be back!
4
After a long spell in France it was great to have a decent Australian flat white coffee again, along with a simple western breakfast (toast + poached eggs + a bowl of granola) which has been difficult to find when we have been in Singapore before. It was a funky place with a good vibe.
4
Nice food (braised beef cheek and lamb chop), thoughtful service staff who initiated the change of plates and cutlery. Mentioned they could have served both mains one after another if they knew we were sharing. Drinks are not worth though (pineapple cider and beer). But will still come back for the food
4
A great find, just a quick lunch of scrambled eggs and a coffee. Lovely food and greatcoffee, I will be back for breakfast tomorrow. Lovely staff and a cool atmosphere. Food came quickly, bill came quickly all an all just right. I want one of these in Cambridge UK!
5
Just by the side of the Pinnacle at Duxton is this gr8 little eatery, frequented by expats and locals alike. (The food is not local though) People love it for brunch but I enjoyed a pulled pork burger with sriracha (hot sauce) and kimchi in a black bun! Really delicious. Interesting selection of beers … our waitress was very helpful and attentive without being pushy. Enjoyed her recommendations .… woud like to come back with the family but I reckon they are pretty busy at weekends …
5
This place is anything but local as it is not serving local food. Having said that, it is a wonderful place. Service was great and they order things off their ipads which they hold on their wrist. The place looks small on the outside but inside there is a big area with nice area. Food was good - not the usual eggs benedict stuff but different food. I had the homemade ricotta toast
2
I saw many good reviews online but I realized it was just an overhyped brunch place. Fancy dish name and long queue but the food is very average and same goes for the service
3
The food was not bad but the waiting time for food was too long. More than half and hour on a friday night.
5
I like lokal for the consistently good coffee and great food. Portions are generous, food is always freshly made. Smoked salmon and makeral are home made. I like the casualness of the environment too.
4
The half roasted chicken portion was amazingly huge! Beef cheek that my fiancé order was very tender too.
4
Waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly - service was prompt and attentive. Food was very good as well - my only gripe would be that the Kampong chicken was a bit too large a serving for one and prices are rather steep. But for great food (the potato rosti and sticky date pudding were awesome!), it's totally justifiable.
2
Came here only because I had a free voucher to spend. Enjoyed the banana bread (it was excellent), but not the baked eggs. On a Saturday afternoon, it was awfully crowded & I just wanted to get the heck out. Service was average & bordering on grumpy - perhaps they were short-handed.I considered returning on another occasion, just because the banana bread was really that impressive. But after the chef went on a rant on my Instagram just because I expressed the Baked Eggs weren't to my liking & were overpriced, I've decided I'd rather have a meal elsewhere. My review wasn't even THAT bad-- I even said the beef was tender.But if you can't handle an opinion different from yours.... I'll do you a favour & dine elsewhere. I don't think The LoKal needs my money anyway, seeing as to how crowded it was.
5
We came here after a sports class - super hungry and hit the perfect spot. The food was super good and very generous portions (we had the pork with greens topped with nuts and dried apples - super, super yummy & steak topped with ruccola).But what I have to highlight was the service (especially since Singapore restaurant service is generally not very impressive). I don't remember her name but this lady was amazing in taking care of us (she was enthusiastic and seems to really likes what she is doing). I'll certainly come back
5
We were tipped by a friend of ours to visit this restaurant .We ordered fish and chips and lobster spaghetti both were delicious.The decoration is very nice and so is the mood inside this place.If we visit Singapore again we will definitely come back
4
I have been here a few times. Breakfast or Lunch or just tea. Interesting EU, punk, street art with tables made of thick steel (thank god they took out the steel chairs that made you freeze your behind off). Good breakfast, good service, some good/great dishes.Easy to go here, popular but not too busy. German but not so German, - there serve bangers and mash
3
My family came for the Lobster roll but was disappointed that it was only available during brunch.Food was acceptable, not fantastic nor outstanding that would bring us back again for another dinner.Best dish was the Braised Beef Cheek which was very tender.Slipper lobster linguine was a tad dry and blandFish & chips were ordinary and not worth the price chargedSirloin was sliced thickly, covered with a mound of lettuce strangely, like as tho to hide the steak; it was reasonably don
4
Cauliflower 3 Ways and Sticky Date Pudding was very nice. Linguine was fine but not so impressive. Friendly people and nice atmosphere were things I liked apart from the dishes they serve.
1
Decor is nice and service staff are very friendly, but coffee was bad, food and juices average, and unlike most similar cafes they charge both service and GST so the bill was a shock.
5
Try the watermelon cocktail! The food is great too. Quiet setting with romantic lighting, definitely recommended to come again!
2
This was my first time visiting the Lokal and while the staff were lovely and attentive, I left feeling hungry from the small, overpriced salad that was served to me.After my friend (who's a regular) said the salads are very good, and being a major salad lover; I was excited to get stuck into the menu. I had seen the table next to me receive a very generous portion of the kale salad which looked amazing; so I decided to try the mackerel salad, with the salmon option. My friend's chicken sandwich looked incredible, so when my half filled plate arrived with hardly any salmon in sight, I was incredibly disappointed. Even she said it was a lot smaller than usual. The tiny portion of side mushrooms was another disappointment - 2 tablespoons' worth at most.Coffee was good, but that's becoming increasingly easy to find in Singapore. I should have said something about my displeasure, but it shouldn't have been so disappointing in the first place. For $30 per person (salad, side of mushrooms and coffee); I think there are much better options
4
Came here with a friend for dinner on a Friday night and the place was fully booked. Nice ambience but a bit too noisy for conversation. Ordered cauliflower 3 way, as recommended by the helpful and friendly waitress. Ordered two other dishes - beetroot salad and 1/2 kampong chicken for sharing. The food was okee, not extraordinary in any way. Would recommend to try if you have not been here before.
4
We ordered the seafood stew (a special for the day), sirloin tagliata and cauliflower 3 ways. Unfortunately, the roasted chicken had sold out by that time - much to our disappointment, but the waitress offered to include the seafood stew under our entertainer promotion. Wait for the food was somewhat long, but forgivable given the Friday crowd. We were offered brownies while we waited, which was a lovely touch.Seafood stew - lobster, scallop, fish and clams in a fish and clam broth. The seafood was fresh, lobsters and scallops were seared and seasoned. Broth was light, sweet and speckled with chives and ikura. A good dish overall, though there was that slight metallic aftertaste owing to the clams. Was craving some bread to soak up the broth and asked the waitress if they sold any - was told that they only served bread for brunch. However, she went to the kitchen to check and came back with 2 slices of sourdough, complimentary. Sirloin tagliata - the sirloin was cooked a good medium rare. A lean cut of steak, no doubt, but without any hint of toughness and was flavourful. Perhaps a tad underseasoned, however. The salad of watercress with cherry tomatoes and parmesan was decent, though not particularly impressive. One regret was that both of the mains we ordered came without carbs - perhaps it would have been good to have the bread already with the stew and perhaps a simple mash/fries to go with the steak. Cauliflower 3 ways - an interesting dish, no doubt. Cauliflower deep fried and pickled, sitting atop a bed of cauliflower mash. Accompanied by young sprouts and another bitter vegetable whose name eludes me. Loved the cauliflower in all its forms - the deep fried one was crisp and lightly seasoned, allowing the mild sweetness of the cauliflower to come through. The pickle was commendable too, with a good crunch and a sweet-saltiness. The mash was smooth, too smooth almost, and creamy but still with a hint of that cauliflower sweetness. Perhaps something that could have been improved was the selection of vegetables, as they both were bitter veggies. And as much as I like my bitter veggies, 2 was a bit too much, also taking into consideration the watercress salad I had earlier with the steak.Overall, the meal was satisfying, with the unique take on cauliflower and well executed classics. Service was attentive and thoroughly welcoming, even given the busy circumstances. Will be back again, perhaps for brunch
2
The decor of this cafe is nice and homey, but for me that was the only good part. I ordered toast, bacon, poached eggs and avocado. I ended up requesting some chilli sauce and putting it on everything to give it some flavour. The bacon was paper thin and unlike any bacon I have ever had before. I was given a choice of spreads for my toast and just wanted butter, and was given one small patty that was enough for one out of the three slices of bread. The coffee was mediocre especially considering my order was the medium cappuccino and supposed to come with a double shot. It wasn't as strong as I would have liked. My friends were also disappointed with their order and one couldn't even finish theirs. At the end of the visit, the cafe was closing up and they offered us a box of blueberry muffins to take away. The muffin was bland too. A very expensive and disappointing visit that would not inspire me to come back again
5
Helmed by an Aussie Chef the lokal serves great brunch with their fish and meat smoked in house! The smoked mackerel is truly amazing as a breakfast side or the salad. Sunday roast is extremely good too. Tried the lobster pasta and the sauce was gorgeous. Def save space for the sticky date pudding!
3
We had the half roast chicken and the sirloin steak tagliata. Chicken was well seasoned and tender, spinach and mushrooms served together were also well done. Portions were generous for the chicken. The steak came medium-rare and garnished with lots of shredded cheese and rockets (?). Serving size was smaller, don't think it would be enough for a hungry person or a big eater, but taste-wise, I have no complains.Now the service is another matter altogether however. The guy who addressed us and showed us our table when we came in had a perpetual black face on. Our main server, a lady, seems to have no sense at all about what service is about. On various occasions, we requested to change a side as well as checked on our orders after a long wait, she responded to say she would check but went away and never came back with a follow up. Isn't it the most basic expectation that a server should follow up with the customer when the customer has asked about something to which no initial answer was provided? I just found it pretty incredible that I had to ask a second time each time to get the answer. This particular server was also pretty stoned-face and uninterested. The only saving grace for the service was this other lady server who was smiley and polite, but a pity she wasn't our main server.Lots to improve on in the service department generally. The customers don't owe your restaurant anything
4
Apologies in advance that I'm unable to provide the exact name of my dish. I had beef steak and half a chicken (with truffle mashed potatoes) to share with my girlfriend. Used 1-for-1 offer on the entertainer app.Steak was nicely done, very juicy and medium rare. Half chicken was equally good too. The price was pretty steep for a cafe, 26++ for half a chicken and 28++ for the steak. Thankfully I have the entertainer app to reduce the burn hole of my pocket.I would definitely come back again, only with the app.
5
Great ambience, attentive service, fabulous cocktail (passionfruit mojito), delicious food. Cushion seating could be a little more comfortable (firmer seats).
4
We were staying down the road so we used this as our breakfast place. We loved it. Kept coming back every day. Nice and relaxing place to sit and enjoy.
5
Simple ingredients cooked greatly by Lokal chefs. Loved everything in particular the cauliflower dish. Simple and homey 👍🏼
2
Don't be deceived by the people lingering outside. We had brunch at the Lokal and was sorely disappointed. The food was mediocre; the banana cake which some people raved about was moist yes, but the sauce was too citrus. The avocado ricotta was pathetic with the cheese splattered over the plate with no effort at presentation. To cap it all the toast was burnt! The staff were more interested in chatting with some regular (I guess) than service. Won't be back anytime.
3
I had breakfast here with family. My daughter had checked the reviews and menu and was keen to try the place.You cannot make reservations so you strictly take your chances that when you arrive there us a table available.Service is pretty good although we did have to chase them to get some water for the table, something I would have expected as a standard in Singapore.The coffee we ordered was hot and a nice flavor. The menu offered some interesting choices all of which seemed appealing and well priced. The meals all arrived in a reasonable time. They were all okay but did not really live up the fanfare of the menu nor the reviews we had read.A funky decor and an interesting place to try. I don't think that it will become a regular for me
4
The place wasn't too hard to find, just a few mins walk away from Outram Park MRT exit G. My group of friends agreed that the starter that we ordered to share - a plate of rosti - was very good. I had the fish & chips for my mains. While the batter was indeed crispy, I found that it was a little too thick and the fish was a little bland for me. Sweet potato fries were thickly cut - would have preferred it to be thinner and more crispy.Serving size wise, 2 of my friends had the roast chicken and the serving was huge, while another friend had the lobster linguine and the serving was much smaller.Overall a nice place to visit though prices are on the higher side - I think they are better known for their brunches as the dinner menu was rather limited
1
This place is horribly inconsistent the food has been good at times and I was once a regular. Unfortunately with a their well deserved uptick in demand the Lokal now suffers from impersonal service and and spotty quality. From my end this is disappointing as this used to be a great place to brunch but recently has just been a waste of time.
5
Where do I start? I love eating at The Lokal. I always have troubles deciding what to order as I wish I could eat all of it. The pumpkin salad is not to be missed. Subtle sweetness of the pumpkin, the fresh pea sprouts, sunflower seeds comes together perfectly! The bread is so good, it's good on its own ... hmmm ..
5
Love the unique food options over here - would recommend not to order the traditional brunch options but rather their signature dishes (like the ricotta or the mackeral salad). The curly fries are also really nice with their homemade ketchup and mayonnaise making it super worth the fries. Highly recommend
2
Not many places I gave 2* and this is one of them and truly deserved. Firstly, yesterday @3.45 p.m. when I stepped in the lady staff told me that they only serve drink and desserts which fine for me. My desire for just have a good coffee. Secondly, I ordered Cortado and Kaya toast and she said "we not make yaka toast this hour of the day. You can order only one we had on the tray". So, I got up to check out 3 choices of pastries that they shown which was muffins (look not in shape and very dried), brownies (not really looks so appetizing and chocolate cake which look at the best. I picked this one. My bad luck coz the taste was horrible I had it for 3 bites that it!! My cortado came with burnt smell, high acidity, flavor and aftertaste just burnt!! I did everything on my own which start to pick up the menu, shout out my orders, got up to pick the cake and got up to paid the bill. There was no service. But it did added on the bill which I don't care. I just count those charge for hip decorations and good air conditioning. Not recommended to anyone who's coffee & desserts lover. Definitely not going back to this place again.

Food tasted good, but portions were too small. Prices are reasonable to start with but I left hungry. The drink of the day tasted great but again was way too small given the price. The Sunday roast was disappointing. Ambiance ideal to meet friends
4
Well designed restaurant and good food well served.
It is in a good location and it was an enjoyable experience.
4
Food is not bad..but i expected a lot more given the raving reviews on the internet. Service is friendly, price is reasonable with decent food.

Been there for Sunday brunch. It is very crowded so better book in advance. If you show up without a booking, the queueing system is quite efficient too. You sign in at the entrance and they call you once the table is ready. And the food is worth the wait. The chef is actually not local, which contradicts a bit the name, but guarantees you to find dishes like "Lokal ricotta" (ricotta cheese with smashed avocado dressed with olive oil).
4
Prepared to queue via the computer system available at its front door. As they don't take any RSVP during the days. Worth to go. Try the Kale pineapple juice, banana caramel yogurt dessert (its signature), kale special salad, zucchini toast...coffee. ..all great. Best to ask them to show the pictures of the menu so easier to understand what they turn to. Great great

This is one of the handful of brunch places in Singapore that serves original and tasty brunch dishes. You can 'pimp' your own breakfast by choosing certain items off the menu (e.g. eggs, toast, baked beans, avocado, sausage, bacon, etc), or choose from a great array of fresh salads, mouth watering burgers, heavenly sweet treats, milkshakes (the peanut butter one is divine!) etc. It's very busy on weekends, so you may need to wait if you have a big group. Otherwise, opt to sit at the kitchen counter and watch the kitchen work their magic

Due to the Chinese New Year celebrations and the demand that was putting on the New Majestic Hotel Restaurant we were given vouchers to take breakfast at Lokal. Which was great at is was just at the top of the road and the food was very good. The voucher provided an opportunity to try somewhere we may not have got to other wse
4
BOTTOM LINE: There is a short list of excellent places for brunch in Singapore, and Lokal is definitely on itTIPS:* [weekend brunch] As with all the top brunch places in Singapore, you can't book tables ahead of time. In my experience 1pm is the busiest time to go, and you'll be waiting for quite some time before you get a seat. If you go 2:00-2:30p or before noon, you'll have a much better time getting a seat* SHARE - even the sandwiches are pretty good for sharing. The servings aren't massive either, so I'd recommend 4 dishes for every 3 people in your party, and sample around* Chope terminal out front - you'll instinctively go inside the restaurant looking to queue for a seat, but you actually need to do it with the chope stand just outside the front doorGOOD:* avocado toast - my favorite dish. just like the stuff you'll find at classic Australian brekky joints* shakes - the banana chocolate shake is delicious* they serve soda - so if you're a diet coke fiend like me, you can get your fix!* efficiency - these guys are pretty good about getting the food and bills to you quickly. better than any of the other top brunch places in SG. They've never gotten our order wrong either. Props to the staff for running a tight ship.BAD:* No pancakes - I'm disappointed that none of the brunch places here do pancakes as a side, but there guys don't even have it as a main anymore (they used to). Not a huge deal as they still have french toast...but come on!* Some ho-hum dishes. On a few occasions, I've had dishes here that literally just taste like the sum of their parts. Like the whole what roast beef sandwich. I taste all the ingredients, and they're fine, but there's no synergy. It's just a group of ingredients
4
It is hard to find a restaurant that can serve exactly what you want for breakfast but the Lokal is pretty close. Apart from having a number of standard breakfast things to choose from and basically order what you want (eggs, toast, bacon etc), they have other specials for something a bit different. If you are Australian and hanging out for that Vegemite toast then this is the place to go. Also the fresh juices are great and they always have special juice concoctions. Coffee isn't bad either. I want to go back and try out the dinner menu
5
This is my favourite place in Singapore. Perfect for brunch or dinner with friends. The food is amazing, nice fresh taste with a lot of healthy ingredients. One of my favourite is the ricotta avogado with almonds and bread. Definitively a must try is one of the dessert: sticky dates pudding with vanilla ice cream, the best ever! The cappuccino and flat white coffee is also very good. During weekends is generally very crowded but the service is very good. It's not cheap but definitively value for money
3
Serves excellent food, tried breakfast. The restaurant serves mainly western style dishes and seems to be very popular. The prices are a big high, though.
3
- Winning location just about 5mins from Outram Park MRT station.
- Friendly staff
- Small space, little windows, not really a place to linger.
- Good espresso.
4
Booked a table for four. Service here is good. Food servicing is small so if you are hungry this may not be the place for you unless you want to order two main courses. Pricing point is around $40 per pax.
5
Have eaten here twice with my family and enjoyed the experience both times. Food is interesting and really good. Servers were very nice to my daughter.
4
The restaurant offers mixture of western and local food. During offer period, they have 1 for 1 main and 1 for 1 beer.
5
We had weekly brunches at The Lokal when I lived in Singapore, and I seriously miss it. Awesome meals in a very pleasant setting. And after your great brunch you can explore one of the better areas of Singapore
5
What an amazing and professional establishment. A wonderful mix of Classic Australian brunch staples given a Singapore twist. The service, the coffee, the food and the ambience are well worth seeking out by local and tourists alike!
4
Stopped here for breakfast after reading some great reviews. The team was not disappointed! Lots of tasty, fresh produce!
5
This lovely coffee shop come restaurant has the most fabulous breakfast selection of anywhere I have yet been in Singapore. And it allows a free choice of lots of different options rather than restricts you to one choice - RESULT.Try the cauliflower cheese, its heavenly.The cakes, pasties, muffins and cookies are to die for. If you go in the morning you will see them being baked and then cooling on trays in front of you. So tempting and worth every calorie.This is my first review in six months and I have added it because I have been so impressed with everything about this lovely place
2
Perched on the top corner of a street, a little sign beckoned us to a well-placed door of the restaurant. We entered to fairly crowded floor, and were asked if we wouldn't mind sharing tables or preferred our own. We said, we preferred a table of our own and wrote our names on the waiting list. We were the first on the list. As we waited a good few minutes, more people came streaming in to write their names on the list. One of the waiters approached us again, and I was surprised to have him asking us again if we wouldn't mind sharing a table with another waiting on the list - and said "Sharing is Caring". Now, I didn't want to wait any longer and agreed reluctantly. We were then seated on an awkward looking table fit only for three, very soon later, joined by another two, so there are now four of us squeezed very uncomfortably together like little children, feeling that soon we will be blessed with out daily porridge in this orphanage. The menu had a very limited selection to choose from, and felt forced to make any kind of decision. We had some smoked salmon, smoked mackerel, kaya toast, pumpkin and some bread. The salmon was very well done and had a terrific taste, but the rest of our order didn't impress. At the end, we were asked to leave because we had just finished our food and others deserved this precious little space that we enjoyed so much. Guess that's the first and last for us
4
Very good to start you lazy weekend. Good coffee and delicious meals. Always quite full the wait to be seated even I if there is a super long line it and they tell you 1 hrs. It may clear fast.
5
Everything is so nice about this place ... Great people and great vibes... the food is nice and delicious . Recently tried for dinner and was pleasantly surprised
5
Saw this advertised in the ANZA magazine and thought it was worth a try. Excellent brunch style menu. Not over complicated but very tasty. The Sticky Date pudding was top notch and not to be missed
4
Good food. Delicious and special. Tempted to try everything there!
Dessert was great! Beer was cheap and cold!
Best Thing: Staff. Friendly, extremely responsive and eager to help.
Felt at home!
Things To improve on: Serving portions can be bigger!
5
3 weeks in Europe without an Australian coffee or Avocado smash breakfast became a dim memory after a visit to this home from home Singapore cafe! Best coffee, sourdough toast, smashed avocado with anything you like, great French Toast, eggs and bacon etc. Could have been in Surry Hills or Hawthorn
3
I was looking for a place to have a snack to start the day, like some sandwich and a juice. It's was a great choice. My husband and I have eaten a toast with fried egg, a muffin and a bacon sandwich. Everything was very tasty and fresh. Unfortunately it's expensive for a fast snack
4
If ure planning to go for weekend brunch, expect Q, waiting time for food will be much longer(ask for the wifi to kill time lol). The food is awesome but bit pricey. Service is average perhaps they're understaff. There's some aspects needs to be improved though
4
I loved the vibe of this place as soon as I walked in. This is the kind of place you can come to for a quick bite or spend an entire evening working on your art/writing/whatever. The service is friendly and attentive and the food nicely made.I'd definitely visit again
3
Went out to the Lokal for a business lunch. The menu's limited but attractive. I tried the Homemade Ricotta (Avocado, Ricotta, Pomelo on Sourdough) and Mocha. Folks also tried their Lobster Roll, Flat White, Cappuccino, & Fries. The Ricotta main was interesting - not enough Pomelo - it wasn't disappointing but the description was definitely more enticing than the end result. The coffee though was excellent. The ambiance and service was very good too. The Lokal is worth a one-time visit
4
This place has a very warm atmosphere and ambience that is sure to settle you down well with your company! I loved that the staff were attentive and food came pretty fast (within 15mins). The music played was a good mix of Top 40 and indie pop. Now I know why people go back even though there's a cafe hopping culture in Singapore.
5
The lunch options are great
Lobster Roll, bangers and mash, black pearl all good options
The service is prompt
3
The cafe has a great ambience but that is pretty much where the charm ends. The food tasted quite bland and processed. Quality and taste of ingredients did not match the prices or the hype. Disappointed
3
I ordered eggs, baked beans, and toast. The food was good. The baked beans was very tasty.
We ordered an orange juice, which cost $5.61. At that price you would think it would be freshly squeezed, but it was out of a bottle.
4
been there a few times and the menu is always changing, showing how the chefs are always improving and not just sticking to a fixed recipe. the interior is romantic and comfortable, suitable for a wind-down session with friends and some good wine.
3
Service was sloppy with me even just a single diner for lunch food was good but i get it for quarter of the price back home sous chef was friendly cant say for the rest of the staff
4
Order 2 starters - truffle fries and ravioli & 2 mains - roasted chicken and beef ribs. Price not cheap though partial cafe concept. Food tasted mostly appetising especially ravioli. Service was friendly and warm throughout. Restaurant is indeed big but air conditioning was not powerful enough to cool whole area given open kitchen. Spent around $53 in total without drinks and using entertainer app which allowed 1-for-1 main course.
3
we often have brunch here but when it gets so crowded and busy the ambience is chaotic and unenjoyable. the food, although great, is a little overpriced for what it is. you have to pay extra for condiments - butter, ketchup and some others, because they say it is homemade. seriously? the coffee is gorgeous as well. however we have started to dwindle our visits there due to the noise and the craziness during brunch - the service suffers tremendously as a result and for the price, all the above doesn't cut it for the experience
2
Came here seeing the "Good food good coffee" sign outside, but that sadly wasn't meant to be. The good coffee part was true though, the soy latte was robust and creamy. But that was it. The English breakfast that we ordered was pricey, and the sausage was a tad on the over-cooked side, making the skin tough and rubbery. The sandwiches were also wwaaaayyy over-priced. I actually did a double take when I did my calculation and realised how much it costs. While the quality was decent, it was too much to pay for a standard sarnie. Service was patchy, with the staff bringing the wrong food to us twice, and then serving our actual food to another table. The servers had also forgotten to bring us cutleries despite reminder twice. I would say that they're under-staffed, but that doesn't seem to be the case as they have alot of staff huddled up behind the counter rather than making eye contact with the customers
3
The Lokal is ironically my local cafe, our office is a few doors down. I still go there for the food but go elsewhere for coffee.... here is why. I normally have my breakfast here, its awesome quality and while not cheap the home smoked fish and eggs of all kinds are awesome, lunch to is decent conitiuing some of the great light bites from breakfast such as the amazing home made ricotta with avocado and adding a pasta and a sandwich of the day. The lobster roll is brilliant.However... there is a major problem that sends me elsewhere, they have terrible service, we used to have meetings there and in the morning at least you can sit there for ages without anyone approaching the table while the staff chat at the counter, annoyingly they are more expensive than the cafe with excellent service one block down. This is a consistent experience and the service is very hit and miss... mainly miss.The time before my morning coffee is while I must be at my least patient, but when its only a few people in the cafe (they weren't even busy) I cannot understand why they don't seem to care that you are there.. very disappointing.Coffee is pretty good but owing to the poor service I only tend to go there for the food....
4
Had dinner here recently, would definitely recommend. Its a funky place, well done throughout with helpful and friendly staff. The highlight was the food which was excellent and very well priced. Good menu options and good drinks options, especially good range of craft beers which was good for me. Dinner is still taking off here so not yet as busy as breakfast/lunch but worth it.Also, been here for breakfast and would definitely recommend, although can be very busy so get here early or be prepared to wait a bit. Great coffee
3
I love my full on English breakfast! I am afraid this restaurant do try but it just doesn't gel with my taste bud.
I do recommend you clock in there at least once if you stay around the corner.
4
Great coffee here and good food options. The cold brew coffee is very refreshing and is served over a large sphere of ice.
5
Have now been here a few times in the past couple of months and every time the food and coffee has been terrific. Music is laid back and atmosphere friendly and unhurried. The mackerel in particular is excellent - thoroughly recommended!
2
Oh, what's wrong with thee? Let's see:1) Coffee and tea came, but without sugar, we actually had to ask for it;2) Coffee was cold;3) We asked for water right at the beginning (the server even repeated this) but it never came until we reminded them 15 mins later;4) Toast comes with either butter OR jam, not both (penny pinching taken to extremes);5) When they say poached eggs, they mean poached eggs- no hollandaise sauce (you have to pay extra for that).Cost of breakfast for two? $53.85 (no, we don't have alcohol for breakfast...neither did we have the hollandaise).After my Mickey Mouse of a breakfast, I actually wanted to go have some fishball mee pok.
3
Came here for brunch after reading great reviews on Honeycombers about them. They seemed very busy. First went in and there was no staff who greeted us so we walked in and the baristas yelled out "HELLO!" We asked for a table for two, to which we were handed a waiting list and said the wait was ONE HOUR. I was ready to give up, but my friend asked if we could sit at the bar and the waiter said sure. After he took our order, 3 other guys came in and were seated within 5 minutes- then two couples came in one after the other and were seated immediately. So no, the wait wasn't one hour. As we were sitting at the bar, there seemed to only be 3 waitresses running the entire restaurant, which had about 30+ seats. Didn't seem very efficient to me at all and they definitely ran into issues. We gave our order- two medium flat whites (+$1 for medium) and the roasted pumpkin salad and roasted beef ciabatta. The food was great and came really quickly- we were very impressed with the quality and they were very generous with the portions. The flat whites however, were disappointing. They both tasted very watered down. My friend who's a coffee snob (in a good way!) kept saying how the coffee taste was way too mild. I decided to ask the barista what they did, and they admitted to adding more milk to the medium-sized coffee.Unacceptable. Flat white is a 1:1 ratio of milk and coffee, if not more coffee. The baristas should not cheat their customers like this- it seems very cheap of them, especially since The Lokal is based of an Australian concept. If we come back, it'd be for the food and not the coffee. And please guys, hire more staff especially when you know it's a public holiday and you'll be swarmed with guests
5
This is a small coffe shop but offers a good option for breakfast, fresh ingredients and amazing flavor, maybe not a lot of variety but gold enougt for breakfast, excellent coffe, muffins and you need to try the scramble eggs with smoked salmon and a side od avocado! Wow whata flavor explosion!
5
Really enjoyed my experience here - the staffs were so friendly and not to mention we got a great view of the open-concept kitchen and that was lovely as well :) i tried the espresso as well as the quinoa pumpkin salad which was generously topped with roasted pumpkins, green beans and cranberries. my friend who got the chicken avocado sandwich had such a generous serving of smashed avocado as well. special mention goes to a staff/barista named Charmaine who was very attentive to our needs :
1
My friend and I chanced on this place for lunch. "Great coffee, food and service" the sign outside said. So we decided to give this place a try. My companion and I ordered a squid ink burger which was really average fare for $18 and a cider each $12. Service was not very good. Although only several tables were occupied, it was diffucult to get the attention of the service staff. Only after paying did we realise that we were charged $15 for the ciders. Thinking it was a mistake, my friend approached the service staff only to be told 'We've increased our prices to $15" When we pointed out that the menu stated $12, we were told 'we're in the process of updating the menu now" in a matter of fact way. Granted that you can raise the prices of your food and drinks, but 1) You updated your POS system but did not update your menu, which i think does a huge disservice to your customers 2) nor did you inform us of it when we placed our order 3) only when we highlighted it were we told that you've revised your price. Your service staff did not apologise nor offer to refund the difference which essentially is a mistake on your part. I think for them to make a claim of "Great coffee, food and service" is an admirable one but unless one tries to live up to what they claim and TRAIN their staff well on these service aspects. I'll not recommend others to go there
4
Almost walked past without noticing this cafe / restaurant - was feeling quite jet lagged but enjoyed a really delicious cauliflower salad and iced latte. The place had a good vibe and although the prices could be seen as expensive, the food was really good quality with fresh ingredients and well balanced flavour
4
finally, the lokal is serving dinner. Chef Darren and his team brings you an assortment of aussie inspired meaty dishes which will leave you purring for more. Personally, i liked the Norwegian salmon salad and that 1/2 kampong chicken. Will be back for more. Full review on my blog @ http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/11/the-lokal-now-serving-aussie-inspired.htm
5
Had lunch yesterday and must say the PIta Sabich and the pasta were awesome . I am a vegetarian and they did an awesome job. Always a pleasure ... great ambience ...
3
I was here twice. The café is nice. The food was okay, not bad. The price for roast beef is acceptable, but the burger is so pretty much pricey.
4
Alright let's set things straight. You pay for what you get right. This cafe is thoughtfully done up. Check out the paintings, tables, open concept kitchen, toilet tap and titles. Very pretty. Food ordered: French toast with crispy bacon, pear and maple cream; TOMATO SOUP ($9 before tax) and cured salmon smashed avo on toast. My companion and I like the smooth but robust coffee. The service efficient and best bit, COLD ASAHI on a hot sunny day in SG. Housed in the same shop house as Goethe Institut, the German Institute. You can pick up some language course info or German film festival info after that chillax meal
5
I've been on a dedicated mission to find the best cafes in Singapore, and today it finally happened. From the minute I walked in I felt comfortable and welcomed by the down to earth staff and open floor plan. I was immediately seated without any attitude about a reservation or que, and enjoyed the best and biggest flat white I've had in a year. Our food came out promptly and was unbelievably fresh and delicious. The roast beef sandwich was juicy and the bread springy and tasty. I had perfectly poached eggs with wilted spinach and the best bacon I've ever tasted, here or in America. We sat for a long time and were not harassed whatsoever. I would have to say this was the best western meal, breakfast, lunch or dinner, I have had in Singapore
5
I visited the Lokal for lunch and was lucky to sit at the counter by the kitchen and got to see the dishes being prepared. Everything is fresh and incredibly tasty. I had a vegetarian Panini - yum. What I really liked about the place is that the ingredients are made in-house, from the butter to the wood smoked fish. Oh, and the coffee is amazing, too. The best flat white I've had in Singapore
5
i really love the lokal. every time I'm in there, i always manage to try different thing in the menu. and i really love their banana bread with the caramel sauce, and their french toast with bacon is also superb.and for vegetarian, you should try their beetroot pumpkin salad, its so yum!it is crowded during weekend, so be prepared to wait, however each time I'm in there i never have to wait that long. this place is definitely for foodie who know their food and willing to pay for it. some ppl can find it expensive, but i feel that you really paying the value for the quality of the food
3
This is a very popular brunch place in the neighborhood. The atmosphere is nice, although a bit too crowded and noisy. Usually you will have to queue around 15 minutes during peak hours.We ordered brunch, and later wanted to order additional side dish, but in the end it wasn't served (nor billed so I guess it wasn't recorded at all). Visually the food looked amazing, wish it tasted as good. Pouched eggs were over-cooked, grilled sourdough were hard, but the sausage and sun-dried tomatoes done well. Average bill per person is around $30 for food and drink
3
A small boutique cafe, this is an interesting change from the coffee chains in Singapore. The place is decorated with wooden fans, tins, upside down plants which gives an interesting ambience. The queue is quite long too, though I don't know what the buzz is about.The food was lackluster for the prices you pay. For sandwiches to cost between $16-$28 (before GST), I had expected a better experience, considering the day before that I had an excellent crab meal for $25/person and excellent dim sum, again for about $25. The pork belly burger ($23) has a slightly more obvious 'porky' taste. It was a lean cut and not oily. However, it was just a burger, and I had expected it to be served with other sides such as fries or salad.The roast chicken panini ($16) was served with generous lashings of avocado and fresh vegetables. The bread is springy and tastes very fresh. As a test of the serving staff, I tried to order an iced Earl Grey, but the server suggested that he could give me some ice for my hot Earl Grey instead, or order other iced drinks from the menu. I decided to go without. The water is free, which is good.Overall, an average cafe that you can do without visiting. The food is expensive and it's a very forgettable experience (except for the price you paid)
2
If you have plenty of time to kill and don't know what to do about it, well by all means go ahead to Lokal. If you have better things to do though, and want to look for places which are well worth your money and time, I'd say think twice bout Lokal.I came here cos I'm staying at the Dorsett Hotel and was pottering about the different restaurants and cafes along the same stretch of road, checking all of them out. Lokal is truly the poorest when it comes to comfort. So you imagine a concrete narrow alley and somebody decided to stuff 50 or so poor souls in there. yup, that sums up the atmosphere. Coffee here was strong and very good I must say, but the food is overpriced for what they deliver. Perhaps it's a local fad here where the hipsters hang out, but I want my food to taste good without having to pay so much for a small sandwich that doesn't even come with sides
2
We were so looking forward and purposely come for lunch, but is a overrated place, service still need to improve, maybe they should consider to train service staff to read menu before service start, because they don't even know what is the soup of the day! We have order roasted beef and veal burger. Roasted beef is thin sliced beef, taste normal, with 3-4 little pcs side "salad", nothing fantastic. Veal burger don't really can taste the veal with very thin layer of veal meat inside, serve with fries but no dip no salt, don't know if is anyone just eat the plain fries like this? And it charge $29 for this burger! Totally under expectation!! A dissatisfy lunch.. Also, Serve coffee but didn't serve with sugar, is the service staff dreaming or I should go use my hand pick a sugar cube for my coffee? Won't be going this place until they will look in to it and do some change
1
I didn't come to a cafe to be rushed and to squeezed, especially not at that price. If you are a small group of 2, don't even bother coming and hoping to have your own table.
5
The coffee at The Lokal is really good, probably the best in this area. The food has some handmade products, like butter or ricotta.
2
Very rushed service. I don't understand the hype. Alot of efforts were put into making the place look hip. Food was so so. Expensive for what you get.
2
We were looking forward to a nice brunch and the initial impression was great. However on entering the cafe, the place was so crowded and a little like the market place. We indicated our preference to have a table for 2 to the waitress and was made to wait for about 45 min outside. After all the waiting time, we were told that we have to share a table. This is not what we are expecting for the price. We decided to go walk around and found this nice place down the road called "The Reading Room". It is an awesome place, comfortable and best of all we have a place just for the two of us on a lazy Sunday afternoon. :
3
Ok, a mixed review. My first visit was just for coffee on a crazy busy Saturday and they burnt the $6 double shot coffee. I went back mid week and the coffee was great. Good service. A nice relaxed decor. Small menu but a decent spread. I got the roast pumpkin and beetroot salad. It was good, but not amazing and prob not worth $16. My friends all thought pretty muck the same.. Really not bad food but for $15-28 you are expecting something really good and it doesn't deliver. Good design, we'll see how it goes.
3
Always looking for a new breakfast haunt and we went along to this one with great expectations. We finished breakfast and it was a little meh. The coffee was good, but my gripe is the food is not as it is described on the menu (for some meals) and it was just average. The sandwiches were good but the egg dishes and their accompaniments were a little wanting. It is a nice space and could be so much more. Hope it is just the kitchen finding its way. Will try again another day
4
There's probably a new cafe opened every week in Singapore! So not all serve good coffee and good food. I usually take flat whites or lattes and the Lokal served very good flaties and lattes. I had their toastie of day and it was good. Roasted chicken panini and banana bread were good as well. Love the casual ambience. However self pay at the front of the cafe plus a crowd awaiting does make it a little noisy and crowded up front. Food is served promptly and good service. One of my favs for sure.
2
Frustrating service of line out the door at around noon on a Sunday. This is Sing and you should expect/plan for lines at Sunday brunch, and know how to deal with them -- especially if you are going to charge the prices.The place looks pretty good in a predictable kind of Singaporean out-of-date-hipster way. Lots of people reading Monacle, tweeting.The food is OK and a good go at healthy food for Singapore - it was just the snobby, disorganized door service to politely waiting customers that trashed the whole thing. I've been a couple of times, and this has been a consistent problem, 2/
4
After searching Burple to get a list of some places to go for good coffee, I jumped in a cab with the address and arrived not knowing where I was. I am a visitor to Singapore and just needed a good coffee in a great cafe. What a great gamble. It was just the place I needed for a great coffee, wonderful ambience and THE best banana cake that I have ever had. It was well fitted out and has very cozy western cafe feel. The service was great and would definitely recommend it for someone looking for a coffee and brunch. Great menu.
4
After hearing some good reviews on The Lokal Cafe, I decided to give it a shot one day when a colleague suggested having lunch together. The Lokal Cafe , an Australian cafe, is a fairly new kid on the block, often packed with coffee lovers in its comfortable setting - one may choose to sit at the tables near the sleek white coffee counter, or prop one's foot up on the plushy couches in the more laid-back area at the back.I settled for the Roast Chicken Panini (SGD$15.00) with crispy pancetta, tomato, avocado, cos and aloli. The chicken was tender and the combination with crispy pancetta and avocado was an intense play on the palate. The juicy and sour-sweet tomato slices, paired with chewy panini bread made the sandwich an exotic blend of textures and in short, the colleague and I enjoyed this creationThe colleague had the Roast Beef on Rye (SGD$17.00) with caramelised onions, watercress and grained mustard creme fraiche. The roast beef was rather tender, and the sweetness was further enhanced by the raw, fresh sweetness of the watercress. This sandwich was a rather juicy treat.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/07/lunch-at-lokal-cafe.htm
