This restaurant was recommended by friends and did not disappoint. Beautiful food with excellent and personable service in an intimate setting. Definitely recommend.

Cosy restaurant with excellent homely Italian food. Good value for money with a range of wines at reasonable prices. Superb attentive service.

Food, service and ambience is good but a bit pricy.
Do try the Grandma‚Äôs cake and the unique Tiramisu when it‚Äôs available!
4
Locally inspired Italian fare cooked simply and well. Small team of 3 and waiting time for food could be slow. Rowdy due to small size of restaurant and would not recommend for intimate dates.
5
Came on my birthday, we had a 4-course dinner and every dish was great. We had a wonderful dining experience. I would recommend this place to friends üëçüëçüëç

Husband and wife, Oscar and Tracey does everythingÔºå. That is all you need to know. She makes the recommendations, and he cooks to perfection. Perfect if you want somewhere quiet away from the crowd.
4
If you‚Äôre flexible with timing, there‚Äôs always a table in this quaint cosy place. Been coming here for years and it‚Äôs safe to say, one of the best comfort food joints for us. Wines are very well priced and the selection and recommendations don‚Äôt disappoint. The pictures say enough for the right portions and great choice between specials and regular menu. There‚Äôs a set menu now, and it‚Äôs diverse. Always like the fish options, and the beef (tempted to stray from being vegetarian) is always tender and full of flavour / great sauces to accompany. Kids lapped up the pasta. Missed some photos as we were too distracted with eating. Great tender octopus!
5
We had the yellow tail cappacio from their daily special menu and mushroom soup from their usual menu. Then we ordered risotto and Australian tenderloin for main courses. All of which we like very much and we will go back again to try other dishes. Service was excellent too.

As there are many new restaurants in town, we stop coming here for a few years until recently, we decided to revisit this cosy husband & wife team (Oscar, the chef. Tracy & her mom run the floor). We bought a bottle of Italian wine and the corkage of $30++ is very reasonable. Main dish range form $17- $45. We have a wonderful time, and the food is still excellence, except for Friday night, there's a little bit of waiting time. Without dessert per head is about S$66, we have to enjoy our birthday cake in the neighbouring cafe as outside food is not allow in Buko Nero, a bit of a disappointment
4
Warm and professional service and great hospitality from Tracy at Buko Nero. I chose the set lunch and had a salad and halibut. I chose the homemade pumpkin and ginger cookie gelato for dessert and found myself wondering if the grandmother's cake would have been a better choice. Still everything seemed pleasant and every second table looked like it was filled with regulars
5
fantastic food, amazing service, i could not ask for more! its no wonder buko nero has remained in business while restaurants along the road come and go. highly recommended
5
Perfect food, excellent service, simply wonderful dining experience throughout. Definitely will go back again.
5
Came for dinner on my wedding anniversary. Food was on point. Enjoyed every course and will be back for more!
5
Been here a few times - awesome food, brilliant service. Fantastic spot for dinner. Don't expect to rush through your meal.
4
Its alway our pleasure to dine at cosy homely atmosphere & delicious Italian cuisine.
Do check out Off the menu dishes as well.
5
This is a restaurant is always something I look forward to when I can get a booking. Food here will never disappoint anyone. A must go to restaurant if you are in Singapore.
5
Great food and service in a magic environment. Highly recommended and will visit again when I return to Singapore.
5
Been around for a very long time this husband and wife team are cooking up a real storm here. food is out of this world all we had was just surprising to the palate . Lovely service kind and gentle. low key place and a little hidden away , but well worth the find. Have to book for sure , no walk ins. atmosphere very chill , not loud and pretentious ,not trying to be a hip place to go .if want noise and action then don't come here. Good for family ,friends and a quite special date. Not cheap but you won't have to do the washing up either !! Enjo
5
Dinner with wife at Buko Nero.Food was really good and we totally enjoyed the ambience and the hospitality.Am not a dessert person, but I could not resist a dessert that is made with Horlicks as the main ingredient!Will definitely return for more.Highly recomend this family-run restaurant
5
Heard so much about this restaurant but have not been able to visit. Finally through help of a very good friend we managed to get the dinner reservation. Cozy and unpretentious ambience. We ordered most of the day's specials and all were excellent. Portions were not too large and we shared all the dishes. Service was excellent. Would visit more often if possible in future
5
Oscar works magic in the kitchen while Tracy's attentiveness to us makes the meal so wonderful which will leave you nothing to complain about!
3
The food is decently priced (except for the desserts, which were expensive) and the ambience was lovely. Service was exquisite. However, I just don't think it's worth queuing and making a booking months in advance.
5
Been ages since I've been to Buko Nero so decided to head there on a whim. Was such a good idea coz the food was delish and it still retains that cosy, intimate vibe. Will not wait long to visit again.
5
Not our first time here and definitely not the last. Food & service amazing. A definite MUST to eat here.
5
Well thought-out Valentine's Day menu! Thanks to Oscar for adding a really flavourful ravioli dish on a busy night and to Tracy for the wonderfully warm service! Amazing to see the passion after all these years, truly fine dining at home!
5
the food was awesome, everything was done just right!! highly recommended.. cozy restaurant.. make sure you dine here at chill pace..
5
Buko nero, perhaps means "black hole" as it is a small place, but far cry from "hole in the wall". The decor is a study in black with knick knacks and modern furniture.Oscar cooks and Tracy serves and must clean up too. The couple run it all by themselves without missteps! I was invited by "monthlys" and had not been here in over a decade. It was great.Everyone was interested in the soup with crab meat. Friday's was cauliflower soup. Most had halibut with tamarind reduction. I opted for the rare Spanish grilled octopus and loved it. I finished my lunch with Grandma's almond cake. The others went for the caramel ice cream which looked wonderful!It's generally quite hard to get a reservation
5
Been to this restaurant several times in the past and food was always very good. Have not visited for a while reason being, very difficult to secure a dinner reservation as they were always full.We were invited by our friends last evening to dine here again. I must say it was the best meal we have had for a long time. Every dish was very well executed by chef Oscar. I even believed if you have no idea what to order, all you need to do is to close your eyes and point at any dish on the menu and you will not be disappointed. Service from the wife, Tracy, was impeccable. She made the whole dining experience extremely pleasant and wonderful. What a charming lady. If I were a man I will fall head over heels in love with her!Well done Tracy and Oscar, keep up your fantastic work
5
We chose this restaurant for my husbands birthday. Charming restaurant run by husband and wife, very relaxed atmosphere, small menu and absolutely delicious food and wine. Prices are high but good value when compared to similar restaurants. We had a wonderful evening and would recommend to friends.
5
After our recent debacle at Bedrock, we called Traci on a whim, not really expecting her to be able to accommodate us on such ridiculously short notice. Much to our jubilant surprise, we were able to be accommodated in their newly constructed counter area. All the main room tables were full, a clear testament to how truly wonderful this place is.Traci and Jeannie, as always, took VERY good care of all of us, including our young son. Always cheerful, never rushed, always attentive, and Oscar's food speaks for itself. We really are starting to wonder why we even bother to give newer places a try when Buko Nero ALWAYS delivers outstandingly delicious food at VERY reasonable prices in a freshly remodeled atmosphere by truly WONDERFUL people. We keep going back, and encourage you to do so, too.Pay more at less competent establishments, if you really want to, but you cannot beat Buko Nero in SG. Truly the all around top contender in a very full and competitive market. Just go, you will be glad you did
5
A limited menu but everything is made fresh and tastes great. Certainly for Singapore standards very good value for money and the prices of the wines are very reasonable. Make a booking. The place is small and VERY popular!
5
This place was off our radar for several years for no apparent reason. Our revisit made us recall once again how good it was before and why it still remains as an excellent restaurant. Comfortable, cosy restaurant with excellent service and food and wines. Will return soon. An improvement with a more effective extraction of the cooking smells would help. Otherwise all's well and good in Buko Nero and it is a gem!

This is one of our favorite places in Singapore. No doubt. Since we were here last time, they have redecorated the place and it looks better. They are now able to serve more tables/plates but they may have stretched themselves by doing that. The place was packed on a Saturday night and the people were a little more stressed than usual given it gets a bit hectic with all those people having dinner and only one person in the kitchen, and probably the wife and mother serving. Not a good ratio. One of the glasses of wine had some ashes in it and it took a very long time to change it. I think that, given they put the empty glasses just below the A/C, and you could see black stuff at the bottom of it, explains the ashes in the wine. It also took quite some time to get the food, at least longer than usual. But the main negative was that, I'm not sure if they've changed this together with the redecoration or not, but the kitchen was not able to keep all the smell in the kitchen and so we left with all our clothes stinking, really stinking to the food that had been prepared. I really don't like it when that happens and it just brings your place down a lot. The food was still very good, as usual, but this together with a more stressfull -less relaxed- experience, means they'll have to change things or we will not go back
5
Had set menu. Homely place with great service. Felt like I've hired a skilful chef as my private cook. Very fresh ingredients with well executed food. Home made bread, ice cream are memorable. Been wanting to visit Buko Nero for 10years, but wasn't easy to nab a reservation at last minute. It didn't disappoint
4
We took the opportunity on a Friday to check out this restaurant for lunch. It turned out to be both enjoyable and reasonably priced (we paid SGD40 each for a three course lunch with coffee).Each of our starters and main courses were well executed prepared and delicious. The desserts were fine but both of us at lunch agreed the starters and mains were better. What we ate:1. Pumpkin soup and eggplant tonnato to start2. Main courses of braised beef cheek on a bed of potato mash and angel hair pasta with a squid and tomato sauce 3. Dessert of flourless chocolate cake and sorbet with berriesThe beef cheek it must be noted was meltingly tender and calls out for special mention. The lunch menu does change daily though. Tracy, the co-owner, kept the front of house running smoothly all by herself (taking orders, serving the food and drinks, making coffee and handling payment) during the lunch shift - well done! Its great to rediscover Buko Nero. The tiny restaurant (8-9 tables) has operated from this spot since the 1990s as far as I recall. We would highly recommend this restaurant in the Tanjong Pajar area. On the whole, we had a better experience than in many of the fancier celebrity chef led Italian offerings that keep popping up in Singapore.

We happened to be in Singapore for our daughters football tournament on the weekend of my husband's birthday. So we planned ahead to celebrate with friends in Buko Nero (our old haunt when we used to live in Singapore). All the arrangements were done via email with the exception of some last minute surprises. The set menu was made up of various selection of starters, main courses & dessert. There were also some yummy canap√É¬©s as guests arrived. All of us thought the food was exceptional & good value for money. Buko Nero has been around for a while & the fact that they survive in competitive Singapore F&B scene says a lot about the quality of their food & the service. We have no hesitation in recommending Buko Nero to everyone looking for good food
5
Aa a visitor to Singapore, we were taken out to dinner by family, it is there favourite place. Well we weren't disappointed, greeted by a beautiful lady, and looked after with attention to detail the entire dinner. Food was fresh and tasty, soup was brilliant yum. I really enjoyed all elements of the dinner from the wine down to dessert. Fabulous a must do but you need to book in advance
5
I'e been wanting to go to Buko Nero for years, but never got my act together with reservations. A friend of mine, who was moving from Singapore the following week, took a chance and called on a Wednesday -- we lucked out and there were 2 seats available for us!We share a pasta, steak, dessert and a bottle of wine -- all were excellent! Service is warm and welcoming. Ambiance is warm and inviting. Definitely recommend and am glad I finally made it
5
We had been here before but given the excellent experience we went there again. And afterwards decided we'll be going there again. It's a no frills operation, I am guessing husband, wife and mother. So it's not a huge place, but very cozy and the food is of the best in Singapore. Really great. From the starters, the amuse bouche, main course to the dessert, it's simply fabulous. You can not do anything wrong by recommending this to anyone
5
Lovely restaurant tucked away in Tanjong Pagar. Service is attentive and friendly while the food is superb. The owner chef is a solo team and he is the only person who cooks the food and plates it. Won't go to any other Italian restaurant in Singapore ever
4
Really darn good but if you're a big eater like me, gotta dish out the $dough$ like kaching kaching. Appetizer, main course, and dessert were all happy explosions of flavor
5
oscar is a great chef.. the italian - asia fusion food is a magnific convination. this place is small but the food is awerosome!
4
It was 10 years ago since I last ate the famous tau Kwa tower. This time, they had a 4 course set dinner which I took. The pasta main can be changed to another pasta or meat/fishThe same set-up remains - the Italian chef husband cooks, the Asian wife tends to all the tables. So the speed will not be fast, be it the food or service. You just have to plan your time and not be in a hurry1st course was Parma ham with melon. Nothing cooked nor impressive. 2nd course was soup, in a tiny tea cup. The main of pasta was with ragout, which my friend had. It looked ok. I swooped mine into one with Sakura ebi and roe. It was quite good. Chocolate dessert was okOverall a simple menu with a simple price of $58/6
5
Just returning after one of the most memorable meals. This tiny, family run restaurant lives up to the entire hype on TA. The food was great & the service better. The owners pay detail to the smallest thing. They even gave us an appetizer on the house. Go there to relax over the meal. This place is meant to be enjoyed with a small, intimate group. I really don't think you can go wrong on any item here. Each and every dish we had was a delight on our palate. The beautiful presentation added to the detail. The desserts are amazing. I do hope to go back soon.
5
The restaurant is small, thus booking is recommended, but don't get frightened by those rumors stating you need to book 3 months in advance: we booked lunch time for the evening. The chef - owner Oscar is cooking a very authentic Italian fare with a modern twist. Absolutely excellent! His wife Tracey mans the tables with skill and a wonderful smile. Try the deserts with gula Melacca, a real treat
5
We had waited a very long time to go there as it was always full whenever I called them. But it was worth the waiting. The atmosphere is typically European, the staff is more than helpful and the food is soooooo good you'll want to return just as we will - definitely. Nice wines as well and there's a set menu also which we almost took but then decided to eat √É¬† la carte anyway. You also get a starter for free and a sorbet in between meals for free. They know how to please you. Nothing more to add to this, it's a superb place and you just have to go there!
5
Well, maybe not the best restaurant ever but this really is a really a high-quality place if you want to have a relaxed and enjoyable meal. Oscar and Tracy go overboard to make you feel welcome and wanted and that your meal is of great importance to them. Tracy's Mum is the support team and just adds to the calm and relaxed atmosphere. The food is is all cooked by Oscar who seems obsessive that it should be very high quality. He chooses great ingredients and enjoys experimenting in fusion as well as traditional Italian dishes. We gave never been disappointed with any of his dishes but if one had to choose a speciality it would be Oscar's soups. This must be one of Singapore's most enjoyable restaurants. I don't know why I'm recommending it because it is already so hard to get in
5
My husband and I try to get a booking and go see Oscar & Tracy (chef & host) at least 4-5 times a year. We have been doing this since we first discovered the place 9 years ago through a recommendation. Over the years, I can only say that the food has been consistently good and it never ever disappoints!The menu is regularly updated with Oscar's creations and what is always readily available is the mushroom soup which is a must try if you are a first-timer at Buko. My other favourite would be the cod fish cooked in any way that Oscar likes :-) My husband would usually go for the meats and pastas which are always perfect. We cannot do away with the set dinner as well because the soup dish in the set is always nothing short of awesome.We were just there recently and we had the Parma ham crostino as one of the starters which was just superb. Our friend liked it so much no one else got the chance for seconds as he gobbled everything up! Desserts were fabulous as well. Anything that Oscar whips up with gula Melaka is a must-try and so is his grandma's cake.The place may not be very big but it is very cosy, comfortable and just right for an enjoyable evening out with family or friends. If you have never been to Buko, I suggest you try to make a booking soon (they take bookings up to one month in advance). Once you get there, just sit back, relax and enjoy what Oscar and Tracy have in store for you

Been hearing quite alot about this nice cozy husband & wife restaurant, so thought of trying my luck to call up to make reservation for Saturday lunch just few days in advance as they don't open on Monday which is my husband's actual Birthday date.Was surprised that I managed to get the reservation (not sure if it's due to lunch) but anyway, we did reach there on time and I really like the ambiance as it's really a good place to chill and catch up with friends (since the orders are prepared by the husband alone therefore waiting time is definitely not going to be fast, so for those who don't have the patience to wait, then don't bother coming here).I ordered the Seabass while my husband had the 3-course set lunch. The seabass is really fresh and the set lunch was quite a good deal too.Overall, I would say the food there is great and will be back to try out the dinner one day (hopefully I don't have to wait a month or two)
5
This little restaurant can easily be missed for those with wandering eyes. It's a small, cozy restaurant served by a total of three people, including the chef. It offers amazing, AMAZING Italian fusion food. I love going there with my family and boyfriend! Do try their dinner set menu! Promise, it won't disappoint. I am also their loyal creamy mushroom soup fan!!
5
We've been there as a couple and the food was delicious and very tasty. Even simple ingredients are very nice in the mouth.
The service is good as well with smiling people.
The atmosphere is quite simple.
5
Marvelous evening with delicious food, excellent service and a balanced and reasonable wine list. Would highly recommend.
4
It is a small and intimate Italian restaurant (seating capacity only about 20-23). Food was good. The service is amazing considering the whole place only had 3 staffs - one in the kitchen as the chef and two attending the customers.
4
This place is not like those previous Italian restaurant I have visited. Service is awesome too. I will definitely comeback and bring some more friends so they can experience the good food too
5
This restaurant is small - about 25 seats - so you may wish to book in advance. Last orders are not at 9:30pm despite indications to that effect on the web. It's also a little difficult to spot- the sign outside is not obvious so best to map it before you head there. The food is fantastic! It's Italian with an Asian influence. Think Sunday dinner kind of meals but a bit more exciting. We had the pork twice cooked and the cod. Both were delicious. The flavours were fantastic. We also tried "my grandmother's cake" to finish which is a lovely, light sponge cake topped with almonds. It is not particularly expensive by Singapore standards and the food is really great quality. Service was good with a full explanation about the menu and the specials. They also kindly arranged a taxi for us when we were leaving. Highly recommended. Enjoy
5
Back again to the one restaurant in singapore that marks every special occasion for us. Always a great meal here. Had the Parma ham crostini, mushroom soup, ravioli, carpaccio and the spaghetti with prawns. Everything perfect! Thanks Tracy & Oscar for always taking care of us. Probably gonna do the grandma's cake with espresso gelato! Yummy
5
We came here in a group of 6 for dinner, having made a reservation 2 weeks in advance. Plenty of interesting choices both on and off the menu, and the daily set dinner menu is remarkable value at about $60. Also a small but decent selection of Italian wines available. Our group opted for the set menu but then substituted for various main courses on the regular menu (at additional cost) and all of us were very pleased with the quality of the food. Well worth a visit and I hope to visit again in the not too distant future
5
A beautiful little family run operation in Tanjong Pagar, Buko Nero is set in a small shophouse, with probably about 25 seats. It is absolutely a family operation, with Tracy Pasinato running the front of house with charm, grace and wit; Husband Oscar working miracles in the kitchen - the man must be an octopus to do it unassisted - and Tracy's mum helping out as and where needed.The food could best be labelled venetian-singaporean fusion, but that doesn't do it justice. It's beautiful, honest italian food, with the occasional asian twist. Our meal stated with an amuse bouche of a thin slice of cucumber, piled with crab meat and smoked paprika. For entree we had a tuna carpaccio and my old favourite, the porcini soup - how Oscar makes it taste so good without illicit substances is beyond me. For main, I'm always conflicted between the more adventurous courses, and the Australian tenderloin. Again, simple stuff done astonishingly well. They also work magic with codfish when it's available. I seem to remember good desserts from previous visits, but was kinda full this time so we had a small cheese plate. The wine list is concise, excellently chosen italian, with some excellent Barolos, Amarones and whatnot, and some real surprises from other parts - the Planeta Syrah from Sicily is a real find. And of course they make a damn fine coffee as well. The only problem is (a) getting a booking and (b) tearing yourself away.. We'll be back when we can get in! Congrats team. Also, they request you not to take pictures of the food, because let's face it, most of us have rubbish macro photography skills, not helped by the cellphone cameras we all use. So please honour their request and enjoy the smiles
5
Planned a surprise proposal for my girlfriend at Buko Nero on August 28th. Had about 20 guests and we booked out the restaurant. The event went smoother than I could ever dreamt and the owners were extremely helpful with all of my special requests that helped make the night even more memorable. Everyone raved about the food and service!! Undoubtedly the best restaurant in Singapore! It's impossible to have a disappointing meal there.
3
I hear this place has a following, and it was full the Friday night we were there. While the food was good especially the scallop tagliatelle, and the service attentive; I found the orders took a while to be served. The place can get stuffy, and seating a little uncomfortable. Overall a good casual ambience, but don't expect a quick mea
4
The place feels welcoming and the food was surprising. Did not expect to find such good food there as I haven't heard much about the place. Only that I felt a little understaffed for them.
5
A gem of a restaurant and definitely not your average Italian. Inter alia we had between us mushroom soup with truffles (the best mushroom soup my wife and I have ever had) and the special soup of the day which was leek watercress and smoked mackerel. This was simply delicious. Most mains were chocolate infused tagliatelle with wagyu beef which was clever and so tasty. Service was simply perfect - efficient and very friendly. Prices are reasonable and ambience cosy - only 6 or 7 tables. Highly recommended
5
I went to Singapore for my best friend's farewell. We chose Buko Nero for the what so called "farewell lunch". At the time we arrived at Buko Nero, we were welcomed by warm greetings from Tracy. Oscar was very busy back there.I wanted to prove the quality of Buko Nero by ordering simple dish: spaghetti aglio e olio. It turns that Tracy & Oscar's spaghetti was the best i've ever had in a restaurant.Well done, Tracy & Oscar, I will definitely book a table for dinner next time
5
We were here as part of farewell lunch with a friend that based in Singapore. She is a loyal customer of this restaurant and recommended this place as venue for our lunch. I was very impressed with cozy environment of the restaurant, it feels like you are sitting in the kitchen of a friend since it has only around 7-8 tables and food is amazing. The only thing that I regret that we are not allowed to take photo of the food that we ate. I think they avoid the menu being copied to other competitor. Too bad
3
The space was charming and food was decent, but service was cold. We didn't get a great vibe starting from when we walked in and we were greeted by an unsmiling, unfriendly "do you have reservations?" Yes, yes, we did. We ordered, we ate, we paid. We went through the motions of eating at a restaurant, as did the servers of serving, but it was very unexciting. I guess the cozy, boutique space misled me to think that the service would also be warm and maybe welcoming? I felt like I was bothering the two server ladies every time I asked for something. We didn't bother staying for dessert. As I said, the food was decent enough and I would have liked to share some pictures, but the restaurant doesn't allow pictures taken of their food. Anyway, if you want to eat good food without the service, this is a decent place. If service matters, don't bother
4
Managed to plan for this trip and snagged a table for a Saturday night. Food was excellent accompanied by a very professional but yet warm service by the small family team. The food was not pretentious and just yummy;very reasonably priced (but I do live in Switzerland). I know the principle is good food without the frills (and we don't want that changed at al) but they could update their dining space with just a bit of sprucing up one of these days.
5
After hearing so much about this difficult-to-book but great restaurant, I decided to dine there and am I glad I did. Not only was the food delicious and reasonably priced but service was adequate and competent. The cosy restaurant seats 20 and runs 2 dining sessions with the second session at 9pm. Despite its size, the restaurant has a sofa area which can comfortably seat 8 - 10 so that around half the people from the earlier dinner seating can linger on when the second session starts. Anyway, we really love our burrata appetiser garnished with the sweetest yummiest cherry tomatoes as well as the yuzu lemon tart served with a scoop of delicious coconut gelato. We are definitely planning a return visit in the near future
2
Food was good albeit service can be a little wanting.. We were there on a Friday night. As we were still full from a later lunch we decided to order to share, one appetitiser and 1 main course. We finished quite early ahead of the schedule and we were chatting at the table when they wanted to move us to the sofa area. It was okay if the restaurant was full or there were people waiting but none of the above.
5
OK, my family, our colleagues, and our friends have been fortunate patrons of Buko Nero for years. The team of Oscar, Tracy, and Jeannie are truly the best at what they do, and what they do is satisfy even the most finicky of palates. I have digestive sensitivities, but host Tracy and chef Oscar ALWAYS accommodate my special dietary needs with no qualms whatsoever. They even pay extra attention to my son's less mature palate, and always serve him food which his 8 year-old stomach thoroughly enjoys. Tracy, Oscar, and Jeannie all go out of their way to make my son feel welcome, as I am sure they would do for any well-behaved child, a step well above and beyond which we sincerely appreciate. I recently booked the entire intimate restaurant for a birthday party, and two weeks later I am still receiving comments from the guests regarding the wonderful experience. The food prepared was truly out-of-this-world, and the wine pairings recommended by Tracy and Oscar were top notch.If you want to spend more money, there are loads of options in SG where you can do so. But if you want amazing food served by truly wonderful professionals to a constantly superb standard, Buko Nero is where you need to be. Thanks
5
this is one of the few restaurants in Singapore that we have been going back for more than 6 years 2007, when we moved here. The service and friendliness of the owner is great, make you feel at home with the great service. The food you can not say no more, it is great. they do change menu which makes it even more interesting every meal
5
Charming place, great food and wonderful experience overall. When it's so good, I just want to keep it short and tell everyone to go try it for yourselves!
5
I got lost and found this place. I had, like no idea what was going on with the food and all the people but it was a lot of fun as i got talking to these (chinese?) people who did not speak english and they were telling me this was Italian food and i was like sure this is.....kinda.....like italian food but it was still super yummy. Anyways i had a ball and this is a great place to eat. The other reviews say you need a reservation but i just walked it and they sat me right down
4
I was having dinner with a small group of colleagues. The place is really small (probably only room for 25 guests) but has a lot of soul and wonderful ambience. The food was fantastic and the service even better! The whole place only had three staff - one in the kitchen and two attending the customers. All smiling and extremely friendly and service minded. Definitely high-end for Singapore! I had the pasta starter with white truffle - wow! Followed by a traditional rabbit dish which you don't see very often in Asia. It was full of succulent flavors and scents - just wonderful. This little gem should be on your 'must do' list. A little pricey but worth it
5
Buko Nero is like an old friend. It's unpretentious good cooking that ticks all the right boxes. People often say that it's hard to land a reservation, since the restaurant only has 20 seats. I have found going for lunch on a Saturday & being one of the first in usually works. Truly.For those who don't know, Buko Nero is the carefully nutured baby of Oscar & Tracy Pasinato, who started the place 13 years ago. The concept is simple: he cooks & she serves. There are no waiters or someliers & it has always been a carefully orchestrated relationship between this husband & wife team. I was served a tiny amuse bouche to whet the appetite: a slice of cucumber with hard boiled egg & a sliver of anchovy. It is utterly delicious & sets the tone for what is to come. Buko Nero offers good value in the form of a three-course set lunch but there are more treasures that await those who venture into the a la carte menu. Deliciously tender morsels of octopus sitting atop slices of ratte potato & drizzled with a light dressing couldn't be simpler or delicious. The pasta of the day was a hand made trioffi with ragu bolognese that had texture, oomph & managed to be silken at the same time. So full of flavor & a delight. I could easily eat several bowls of this.There were many dessert options but somehow the espresson pannacotta with a topping of coconut cream hit the spot for me. Saturday lunch saw all the tables taken when I left after my very satisfying meal. I will definitely be back!

We have been going to Buko Nero for 10 years and it's still amazing. The food is just beyond expectations and Oscar, Tracy and mum are as welcoming as ever, shame we now live in Sydney ad only get back once a year but it is worth the wait. With so much change in Singapore and so any places to eat it is so nice to visit Buko Nero which now feels like an old friend. Persevere with a reservation date it's worth the wait

I was lucky and got a reservation at Buko Nero just one night before. The tiny restaurant was cosy as could be, and the service was very hospitable, like I was visiting a friend's home for a meal. This is especially so since you are served by the owners and there are no other waiters/waitresses. We had the 5-course dinner set, and every single dish was stellar and did not fail to impress. The food was unique but unpretentious and easy to understand, and like my mother said "cooked with love", an element missing in so many other establishments. I could even hear our fish sizzling away in the kitchen :P Even the olive oil based bread (which is baked in-house twice daily) that was served before the meal was heavenly. They definitely deserve their rave reviews

This small but cozy restaurant is my must-go everytime I go to Singapore. The food there is just delicious and never disappoints me! I believe it's owned by a couple where the husband is the chef and the wife work son the floor. For the food that they serve, I'd say they are undercharging - simply love this little restaurant

The Italian word "Buko Nero" means " Black Hole"...But believe you me, this Black Hole if, and when you manage to get into it, serves the most delicious imaginative Italian food. It is situated at 126 Tanjong Pagar Road‚Ä¶ telephone 63246225This is a restaurant with limited space for just 7 tables and a maximum of 26 guests. It‚Äôs circa 650 sq feet of space is simple and tastefully decorated. I just have to mention their little toilet which is the sweetest and cutest I have come across. I usually spend more time in there than is necessary. In this restaurant you can be assured that food and service is consistently excellent because it is owned and run by Oscar the chef, and his 2 helpers, his wife Tracy who serves tables assisted by Tracy‚Äôs mother Jenni. No one here will ever complain of bad service because even if you had to waited just a tad longer for your meal, it is every bit worth the wait. Besides, charming Tracy and her equally charming mother are always present to ensure that you are being well looked after. Prices for food here are very reasonable. Starters average SGD 23++. My all time, every time favourite is the Buko Nero Tau Foo tower. It is sooo yummy!! Pastas are priced at SGD 27++, mains of fish and meat dishes at SGD 38/39++. Set Menus for Lunch and Dinner are great value for money. Lunch 3 course set menu is priced at SGD 29.50 ++Dinner 5 course set menu at SGD 55 ++A mention on wines..Buko Nero has a compact selection of good wines. So why wait‚Ä¶.Make your reservations now as it will be some time before you are able to get a table . Tip for Diners : Lunch: only on Fridays and Saturdays Dinner: Tuesdays through SaturdaysLotus_Ku

Dining here is always worth the wait. Wait? Book ahead! Don't just turn up. It is small, intimate, friendly, and the food is fantastic. Husband and wife team Oscar and tracy, the owners, deserve credit for maintaining an excellent establishment at a very reasonable price. In a word: wonderful

Like the fact that it is run by a husband and wife team. Food quality is very good.Downside - small place and difficult to get a reservation so have to plan well ahead.Have maintained quality of the food as the owner is the chef himself

I have been to this restaurant several times over the years and have never been disappointed. A husband and wife team,Oscar and Tracy run this tiny place which has a menu that changes constantly. Their daily specials are worth a try. The couple work wonderfully together to bring you the best quality food and service in a warm and cozy environment. Oscar's innovative take on Italian cuisine is a refreshing experience. He does it all by himself with no help in the kitchen which is why they keep it small. This place is very popular and reservations must be made well in advance. There is no chance of getting a table without one. It's a little off the beaten track but it will be well worth it. Excellent quality food and service at a reasonable price. This couple have found the right formula and are definately doing something right !

I lived in Singapore for a year and this is one of five places that provide both an excellent meal and value. You must book well in advance. Neighborhood is wedding stores by day, girlie bars by night....but still very safe. Restaurant is very small and run by a wonderful family. Food is very authentic and competes with all of the overpriced restaurants as far as quality, flavor and creativity. Well worth the wait and certainly a treat

Have been to this tiny husband and wife run place (Oscar in the kitchen and Tracy in the front of the house with her mum helping out) several times now over the years and each time come away satisfied. If going for first time, do try the tofu appetizer. Not exactly Italian but if something tastes so good, who cares! Very consistent quality. Ps on mission to fix the restaurant ratings on tripadvisor. If they don't change visitors should check out IS or TimeOut instead as the food ratings for Singapore on this board are shameful

Had dinner tonight at Buko Nemo - and it was truly excellent in all things. We had the set menu - which at $55 was great value. Perfect five courses of delicious food. The wines were also excellent - as was the service. Highly highly recommended

I love supporting small neignbourhood restaurants, and so tried Buko Nero based on tripadvisor reviews. The place is only small, it was full so was glad I booked, the prices were good and so my and a friend ordered up with gusto. really good food, really friendly staff and as I say well priced. I recommend and will return

My friend treated me to lunch at Buko Nero when I was in Singapore. Buko Nero is a small but unique fine dining Italian restaurant operated by a husband (an Italian at back of house as chef) and wife (a Singaporean at front of house as server) team. It is very popular among the locals and almost impossible to get reservations. I understand the waiting list is approx 3 wks. The place is small with around 6 tables, with an even smaller kitchen. The chef was busy preparing food while the wife was taking order and serving customers. Surprisingly, everything was run efficiently without much waiting time. Atmosphere was good and relaxing while we enjoyed the excellent food. As a fine dining restaurant, it was very reasonably priced (but do not expect big portion). Given the opportunity, I will definitely be back for more

I was lucky enough to get a luncheon booking for one on my first day in Singapore.I chose the set menu for $29 and it was worth every penny. The milk chocolate and hazelnutCake was a triumph. I am amazed how the chef can prepare such delicious meals in such a confined space, but it is great husband and wife team that produces wonderful food and service.A very enjoyable experienc

First time at Buko Nero, have to admit was a little hard to find. Located along the row of shophouses nearer to the end of the street. Would have totally missed it it we werent looking for it.Small quaint looking place, family owned, with only 7-8 tables. Decor was simple but to taste, music was apt, service was excellent.Food was just EXCELLENT. we ordered the Set Dinner, but switched the Mains to their daily specials. Started with the Beef Carpaccio, with a hint of vinegar. Superb. The Cauliflower soup with Scallops was so flavourful we finished every last drop. Peach Sorebt to cleanse our palettes, followed by our mains. She had the Goose Liver Ravioli, i had the Twice Cooked Pork Chop. Both was heavenly, the exquisite aftertaste of both dishes was just amazing, it seemed to linger on on our taste buds even after our meal. Dessert was this Hazelnut Pie/Tart which just seemed to crumble in our mouths... we wished it didnt end then... and we will be back...Hits: EverythingMiss: NilWould recommend this place to everyone, at least to try it at least once

We have been going here for dinner for about 8 years when we lived here and now every time we stop over. You have to book but its worth the wait. What Oscar produces out of his tiny kitchen is a miracle and with his lovely wife Tracy at front of house looking after you makes it perfection

Went to Buko Nero after a long spell...after patiently waiting for our booking to arrive. Oscar and Tracy still deliver gems on the dining table. My wife and son had the goose liver ravioli...and absolutely loved it. My daughter had the cray fish and clams pasta...and I actually envied those succulent clams from my seat! Drool! Nonetheless, I savoured my cod with crispy spicy crust. What a treat! Obviously, Oscar and Tracy use the freshest ingredients they find on market day...and so the menu is as a dining surprise should be when you walk into Buko Nero after a long wait for your booking to arrive. The Korean Pear Crumble was a treat on the tongue and a crunch on the teeth...what an interesting combination. The crumble and pear pieces are assembled, not baked together and topped with vanilla ice cream. What a nice finish to quiet coversation and quality dining with family. Hope it won't be a long spell from here

One inedible meal that was sent back for another and then charged for 2, when queried with the chef he told us he was right and we were wrong! Will never return. If you enjoy good food, don't bother, just stay at home!

Fresh food every day, be sure to book in advance

Fabulous service and great food at fairly reasonable prices. the only problem is that it's not easy to get a reservation.

one month booking, what do you think!!

Speechless - best in Singapore - You really have to book but if you want some advicem- Give Tracey a call on the eve you want to go and maybe she will sneak in a 2 or 4 at 9pm. Otherwise you need to book a few weeks in advance- only seats about 30 - not even - and a good mix of local and expat diners- really one of the better establishments in the Lion City. A must try location- book from your home outside of Singapore and make the trip to Tanjong Pagar just near China Town for a delightful meal if you have the luxury of a stopover in Singapore. Prices are great- they also do a $60 -or there abouts - set menu which is incredible value for money- I think it is five courses- delightful. My NUMBER ONE pic around town and has been this way for past 4 year

We got lucky and managed to get a cancellation only a week ahead of our meal. Since we moved to Singapore, I've never been organised enough to book restaurants four weeks ahead of time so this was our first meal at Buko Nero in three years. We were not disappointed. The atmosphere is wonderful. Very intimate. The menu is suprisingky extensive by the time that you include the specialsvand the tasting menu. The wine list is concise but well thought out and attractively priced. We had a wonderful meal. All ate slightly different dishes and everyone was happy. The service was perfect; informal but well informed. We will not make the mistake of holding out for a cancellation again, in future we will book our next meal as we are paying the bill

What an amazing little place. I am reticent to share details as I want to keep it to myself! in case it's full next time I try to book!I ate here last night with my partner for our anniversary. There are only about 6 tables and the place was full even on a Tuesday. The service was personal and friendly, with recommendations and details of daily specials. Every dish we ate was lovingly prepared and very far removed from the usual bog-standard Italian fare on offer in most Italian restaurants in Singapore. Each dish tasted amazing, incredibly fresh and melt-in-the-mouth. The deserts were to die for. Both myself and my partner had 3 courses and shared a great bottle of red wine. The total prices was $260 which I think was great value for money based on the quality of the food. We will definitely return here

I have been to Buko Nero twice now, and both times have been lovely dining experiences! Yes you have to book a month or a few weeks in advance, but that is also part of its charm. Tucked away in a little converted shophouse in Chinatown, it is a very cosy restaurant - there are only about 8 tables and you almost feel like you are dining at home, it is so intimate and comfortable. Whilst Buko Nero offers a la carte, they do a tasting menu at S$ 48 for 5 courses which I think changes daily and is great value. You can see that the chef really does take his time deciding his recipes and menus - the flavours are all creative and delicately put together. The last set menu we had was a mix of beef carpaccio & watercress, japanese pumpkin, basil oil & crab soup, strawberry & yuzu sorbet, minced meat & aubergine penne and a most divine dessert of amaretto & almond cake topped with home-made coffee gelato!They also have a very nice Italian wine list and good wines by the glass. Definitely a restaurant to try with a special person or just a group of good friends

We had to wait for a table to be cleared for us so were sat down on a small couch and asked if we would like a drink. From there on the service was personal and perfect and the food very very good. We BYOed a bottle of Perrier-Jouet Epoque that was matched by both the food and service
