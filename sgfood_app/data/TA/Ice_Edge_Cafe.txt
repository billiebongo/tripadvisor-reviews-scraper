Located in the heartlands, in a cozy dark Neighbourhood, it has a more private feel. The wagyu beef is yummy! Waffles are pretty good too.

Went with a group of friends for coffee, sake and waffle ice cream. Many variety of ice cream and the baileys ice cream is nice. Waffle is crispy and ambience is lively

Came here just for the waffle ice cream as I'm nearby this place. It was made the way it is. Pretty average with good value.

Good place to eat even for vegetarian. Staff courteous. Excellant desrts and Ice cream. Pasta and Pizza weregood too

We used to come there often but tonight the experience was really bad. - Awful music from the nineties, really too loud with low quality speakers that hurt your ears. - Cordon bleu not enough cooked, same for the fish and chips. Iâ€™m a bit worried about our health here.

I love this place! The food is delicious! I like to visit it during weekday lunch time as there is a 1-1 promotion on various popular items. Try the pest chicken or the fish & chips. After that, get a scoop of Mao Shan Wang gelato - my mother (diehard durian fan) gives it a thumbs up!

Decided to come to Kovan as I haven't been to the area before. Went on TripAdvisor to scout for good food places and decided on this cafe. The dishes we had were on point, the tom yum linguini and truffle fries are good but the cream mentaiko pasta exceeded expectations. Its worth trying if you like mentaiko. Gelato wise, the mao shan wang is flavourful and creamy. Nutella is not too bad but I prefer former
5
It was my first time there and we ordered tom yum pasta due to rave reviews. It did not disappoint, very tasty and unforgettable flavour. The prawn salad sprinkled with bonito flakes was a well coordinated dish. We liked the food. Iced mocha was commendable too.
5
Been here a few times, keep returning because it is what it is. No pretence, good quality European food cooked well. Staff are good and friendly. If you like ice cream then that is another reason to visit , many flavours to choose from. So, if you are in the Kovan area and want a good meal in a warm and friendly environment then Ice Edge can be relied upon.

Not so easy to notice this cafe due to its location and entrance orientation, which is beside a roundabout. But I'm surprised at the big crowd on certain days. It has developed quite a following among the locals in the community. Try their chicken in pesto sauce which comes with potato wedges, carrots and green leaves. Nice! Good combination of semi-crispiness and creaminess. Meal is so much better with your favorite drink, like an ice cold Heineken. For dessert, it's hard to resist their premium gelato. I got the strawberry cheese. You have options of one or two scoops in a cup. Can request for a small spoon to pre-taste before you place your order. Glad this cafe is near my place.

It is a regular dining café for my family as it is near to our home. We really enjoy the pasta, pizza and of course the waffles with ice-cream there. Prices are pretty reasonable and it opens till late.
4
been here few times and definitely a gem near Kovan mrt. place is cozy, nice staff and great variety of desserts. love their gelatos and tiramisu!

Industrial deco peppered with chandeliers, cute dolls, pictures of super heroes and motor cycles. Feels like entering a well lived in family home. Food was OK but the waffles is exactly how I like it - crispy on the outside, soft inside.

Don't have to make reservations for this place. Perfect for a chill night to drink and cafe food was affordable and not pricey. Best still good tasting & portion :)Choice of ice creams and waffles as well.However the billing system is a bit strange where you pay for the ice-cream on the spot and your dining separately.Clean & Prompt Service. John at the cashier was very friendly! Will definitely go there again! since its so near the heartlands.Probably one bad thing is the car-park availability

This cafe can get quite busy during lunch, as many people know of the value for money lunch specials that can be had at this nice cafe. Selected items are 1-for-1, making it a steal for some above-average quality meals.After a nice main course for lunch or dinner, don't forget to leave space and order the Waffle with ice-cream. Nice, fluffy, crispy waffle topped with your selection of their yummylicious ice cream flavours
4
Went there for a casual dinner. This was not first time to dine there. I realized the staff weren't very attentive but we were well received when we were arrived. I like your booking system.I like your 1 for 1 lunch promotion for weekday. keep it up :)Strongly Recommeded are Japan Bonito Prawn Salad, Seafood Aglio Olio Spaghetti, waffles with ice cream and pork ribs

My family finally wandered in after weeks of passing by. A disappointment. This was a late night visit during a week night when the cafe had a nice buzz. Not too crowded to be overwhelming and with sufficient people to feel like it was a good spot to chill. The boys' ice creams came soon enough after ordering. Our baked desserts were nowhere to be found for almost thirty minutes. Upon asking, a waiter confessed that it did not usually take so long but that they had had to be redone. When the desserts finally arrived - not a word of apology about how long it took or thank you for waiting. I suspect they would even have hoped that we did not notice about what happened to them. Taste-wise: the lava cakes were decent but the salted caramel ice cream was too salty for taste. Add to that the difficult parking situation (not their doing) and I would not be back in a hurry, if at all
4
The waffles are made upon order so we waited for about 15mins for our order. Worth the wait cos it was served warm and crispy with 2 generous scope of ice cream on top (can choose between 1 to 4 scopes of ice cream). There was an extensive range of Ice cream flavours (more than 20) to choose from and I recommend the flavours like 'lychee martini' which tastes more like a sherbet & 'champagne vanilla'. Both taste very refreshing and has a very slight hint of alcohol.

This cafe is located nearby Kovan MRT, just about 3 mins walking distance to this cafe. It is open till 11.30pm daily, thus it is a good place for gathering, supper and chit chat session till late. We have ordered tha mao shan wang lava cake with mao shan wang gelato, simply great taste. There are water dispenser nearby, so customer who wanted hot or cold water can just self-service. It is very crowded even for a Monday night, the staff still asked me for the standard of the dessert when i paying at the cashier. Definitely will be back to try on other food as well, highly recommended, price is good value for a cafe in the heartland
4
quality of food is great despite the 1 for 1 promo and the lunch crowd. the portion of food is just right, anything more will become food waste for most of the diners. and not forgetting that they are famed for the gelato which i had yet to try. Will be back again soon for their desert and gelato..
3
Food served was good but a little pricey and portion a bit small. Good variety of icecream and mains. However witnessed unprofessional senior staff reprimanding loudly junior staff in front of customer. Was disturbed by the incident.
4
wonderful experience, went to the cafe last week to spend the birthday with my friends, the ice cream is a must try! Especially the cotton candy flavour, fantastic! Will like to went there again!
4
Visited here a couple of times. My favorite here is the truffle fries. But their Lava Cake really is a very must try. You can choose any of the flavors.
4
Durian ice and cake recommend. many variety of ice cream.
good place for friends hang out for evening talk or chit chat.
I was there after dinner nearby. walk distance from Kovan MRT.
will recommend friends come again.

Loves the waffles and lave cakes . You may have to ask them to cook the waffles longer so that you get the crispy bites. The lychee martini and rum and raisin ice are nice try . Warm durian lava cakes served with a scoop of cold ice is certainly a good experience
4
Very worth to go for this lunch treat with qualify of food. Bring along with a friend to join you for this good deal. Was been invited by friend to join her to know this deal. I came a few times for dinner. Staff were friendly. If you have nothing to do but just want to have a coffee by yourself just to chill, you can consider this place too.
3
The place is near my house and I come here once for the ice cream after my meal. I find their ice cream unique and seem to be made by their own. The cafe is quite popular and crowded therefore I decide to walk in and have dessert

Situated in a corner at Simon Road, this cafe is very popular during the lunch period.There is a good list of 1 for 1 main course. The 1 for 1 meal also applies to appetizer, soup n drink! Ordered 8 meals for the price of 4!!!Food quality is awesome too!Thumb up!!!1 for 1 meal only applies to weekday thoug

We started with some light bites, one of which was the Calamari Fritti (SGD$12.80) - battered squid rings deep fried till a crispy golden brown. These squid rings were surprisingly good, giving the palate a beautiful contrast of crackling exterior giving way to succulent, chewy flesh within.There was another starter of Buffalo Wings (SGD$9.80) - deep fried chicken wings with Ice Edge's own secret spicy herb sauce. The wings were rather well done with crispy skin and juicy, tender meat. The secret spicy herb sauce penetrated the wings very well too, giving it a very delectable flavor that piques the senses instantly.I had the Fish and Chips (SGD$16.90) which was pretty common fare consisting of crumbly battered exterior and soft, smooth interior. The fries were pretty common shoestring fries as well.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/05/lunch-at-ice-edge-cafe-kovan-revisit.htm

Visited Ice Edge Cafe a few weeks ago with friends. Loved the location! This cafe is a perfect hideaway without being too inconveniently located. For starters we shared a basket of truffle fries and chicken wings-both dishes were delicious but especially the truffle fries were amazing! I used to think P.S cafe had the best truffle fries in Singapore but the quality of Ice Edge Cafe's truffle fries surpassed all expectations. The best in Singapore hands down! For mains we had the seafood aglio olio and Japanese romana pizza- pasta was perfectly cooked. The pizza was fairly good but the aglio olio was even better. For dessert we had the both yuzu and lychee martini gelato. The flavours were fantastic- the perfect blend leaving you wanting more. Would definitely return to Ice Edge..especially for the truffle fries and gelato! Delicious!
