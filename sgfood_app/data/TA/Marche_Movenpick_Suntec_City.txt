Nice food and ambience as always. Was there with about 20 in the group. Had people from different countries so it was great that they could see the food before ordering. Everyone who chose to have ice- cream gave it a thumbs up.

A fun experience. Everything done to order, nice portions, pleasant service! Went twice, once with a large group the second time with the wife.

Great place for salads and a variety of feast. It’s has a food court like setting with different type of food in different counter. Tried rossti... quite oily but very tasty
4
Haven’t eaten here in years, so decided to give it a try. Kids loved it and enjoyed the wide selection of food and desserts. Steaks were
grilled well and overall food was quite tasty. Will definitely be back.

I was there with my 2 kids for lunch. We had Crepe with Salmon and 2 swiss rosti with veal sausages and a beer. It was not my first visit as I work nearby. The rosti was ok (I asked the chef to reduce the amount of cooking oil as in my previous experience, the rosti were too oily). The kids asked for tap water and were told that the restaurant don't serve tap water as the water is not potable. This is not a joke. The answer we got was: the water is not drinkable. This was the answer we got. I'm wondering how Marche cook and wash its vegetables if the water is not potable? Maybe they boil the water or maybe they use the water they are selling in the restaurant at SGD 4.2 for a 2dl bottle?? Well, everyone, even the Ang Moh, knows that the water in Singapore is safe and perfectly drinkable. This is not very environmentally friendly and does not really correspond to what Mr Markus Greiner, Director of Operations says on its website: We place a high value on using natural, local products. It’s the honest way we work before our guests’ very eyes that has made us stand out – for around 35 years. Well, just above, I read natural, "local" products and "honest". This is not the impression I had today when visiting Marche at Suntec. By the way, I was there last week and it was not a problem to get tap water

Extremely rude and unhelpful staff. I had a promotional discount which I was told would apply to all food items. At check out it turned out that main courses (i.e. platters) were excluded. While I don’t care about the 15 dollars, it’s just a matter of principle - either you choose to participate in a promotion or you don’t. I won’t be coming back and will tell friends & colleagues to avoid this place. Sorry - but this is a bad customer retention strategy.

Our boys loved this place not only because there is a play area but because the food is really good too. A bit pricy but the quality and preparation of the food justifies the bill. The only problem I think that they need to address is how crammed the place got when all the tables got filled. I think the tables should have more space between them to allow for the guests to walk to their table easily, especially if they are carrying their food.over-all it was a fun and enjoyable experience for both the kids and adults

It's a food court selling European style food. You get what you pay for.Had the pork knuckle with sauerkraut which was as okay. The kids had pasta and my wife and her cousin had lamb chops and pork knuckle and kids had an ice cream cone each - bill was 170$S.Service is shopping mall food court without the smiles- staff look stressed.Not worth going out of your way for

I just came here for a light snack, ended up ordering Paella, which was delicious, and chocomint ice cream. The attendants were really lovely and nice, really smiling and accommodating. :) I didn't know how to "chope" a table so I lost it TT__TT I'm not familiar with SG customs and practices, and I did leave a tissue there but someone still took it @.@ Overall excellent, homey ambience, it's wonderful if you love dim lighting. If I wasn't taken her by a friend, I would've completely missed this place! It seemed to be hidden
5
- very casual & friendly atmosphere- lotsvof variety and food stations, all sorts of food & drinks available- even for vegetarians, lots of options- food quality and taste was wonderful, very fresh- restaurant could do a better job keeping up with the pace (silverware wasn't always stocked, and they don't get you free drinking water...
3
It's a good hangout place to catch-up with friends over dinner. Plenty of stalls to choose from, Rosti, pizza, pasta, crepe, drinks, desserts etc.
I chose roasted chicken crepe at $15.90++ and food portion is huge.
Hope this helps.

The mushroom soup was very very salty.
The margarita pizza was very salty.
The rosti, potatoes was overcooked.
This outlet standard is really low.
I think Vivo outlet is better.
5
This is a marketplace style eatery. You walk around and pick what you want. Prices range from low to mid-high. European (Swiss) cuisine. The fresh fish is excellent, as are the wraps and salads.
4
Interesting little place with various stations that prepared the food as you order. Very self-service oriented culture. It would have been better if it were less expensive, but I still enjoyed it. The ambience takes you away from the modern rush of Suntec City itself, so it's worth taking a look!
4
This restaurant has different stations, salad, pasta, fish, meat and drink counter.Very friendly staff and nice food.Every day there are specials of the day for a fix price, BUT pay attention when they as if you want some extra’s these are not coming for free. These ad’s on make your bill quite high for a lunch!
5
At the weekend all day eatingpro I can recommend all fresh prepared food at the cocking station. As a frequent customer of the restaurant, I must comment that the standard of the food served is still pretty good, especially my all time favourite Rosti. the fish and pasta is also great. the prices are moderate. Cons My wish would be a stand with more healthy eating and more then current 4 hot vegetables Selection. the baked potato is very dry
5
A different concept of open kitchen, good food. I found it bit overpriced for items like Pasta and Pizzas. Best dish they serve is Rosti. Good Ambience. Suntec city staff are very friendly and good. Somerset staff not so goo
4
Dinner at the Marche' restaurant was a new experience for me. There were many live counters preparing fresh dishes, serving Ice Creams, fruits and liquor. Choosing a right dish was little tough. Every dish looked delicious. I finally had Rosti with pork sausage. I was delicious
4
Besides the regular dine in options, how about grabbing a decent sandwich and a drink for a quick lunch or dinner. I always love their food especially their savoury crepe and rosti with sausage, but recently i have tried their bakery cafe (before the entrance to the restaurant.) sandwiches were good for my standards and i fell in love with their mozzarella cheese tomato with pesto on multigrain walnut loaf. Oh, and smoked duck sandwich was yummy as well.
3
Being a frequent customer of the restaurant, I must comment that the standard of the food served is still pretty good, especially my all time favourite Rosti. However the standard of their fried calamari has dropped drastically and I believe it is the batter used. It just doesn't taste as good as it used to taste, unfortunately
4
This is a nicer but smaller venue than the one in 313 with street view and higher ceiling. Food is as expected of good quality and with lots of choices. Swiss standard as its best with moderation pricing.
4
Bought loaves of bread here due to convenience.
Surprisingly nice bread.
Will consider trying the other items
3
I ordered a chicken breast, it wasn't the best but it was okay. I didn't order anything else. The prices were overpriced.
5
Had late lunch at this outlet. Not much people, service was bit slow but food Mad up for the lack of service staff around. Good for family or after work meal to chillax
5
The food were excellent! There were a lot of choices from appetizers to entrees to dessert. They have salads, soups, pasta, pizza, paella, rosti and grilled meat. Cakes, ice cream and puddings for dessert. They also have a small playground inside for the kids. It is a great place for the family. The staff provides great service. I commend Hong Nan, Dayana and Chloe were excellent. We would definitely be going back

This month Marche was having farm fresh white asparagus imported directly from Germany, which was available in various dishes such as white asparagus with hollandaise sauce, asparagus pasta, pizza, crepe, soup and rosti.White asparagus soup ($7.90+)One could help yourself to the free flow bread croutons, and chopped spring onions on the counter. The soup was rich and creamy but was a tab too peppery. Could only found chopped carrots but not asparagus in it.Savoury Crepe with White Asparagus, Black Forest Ham and Cream Cheese Spread ($19.90+)Served with greens and cream sauce by the side.The serving was huge and packed with chopped white asparagus, ham, cheese sprea, shredded purple cabbage. Not bad but felt that the crepe was a tab too charred. The asparagus should get skinned a bit more as it was a tab hard to chew for some part
5
Came in here for lunch on Friday, and enjoyed the set lunch offer. Pork rib set with drink costs 12.90 is value for money. Kid's meal of 10.90, we can choose pizza, soup or pasta with juice. We have chosen chicken pizza, which my girl enjoyed it very much. We also ordered oyster and rosti, the oyster is fresh with natural saltiness and rosti is crispy. Saw that promo of free kid's meal with min 60 in single receipt, unfortunately this promo only valid from Monday to Thursday.
5
The place is predictable and reasonable. You get fast service and multiple options from fresh pizza/Pasta: really good, to fresh seafood cooked to order: top quality. Or you can select soup and salad, or get the meal of the day (meat and potatoes) from the swiss kitchenIt is huge with outside seating area, they have a juice bar, fresh parties and a bar area. Great for family, business luncheon or friends outin

Spent 9 days in SG, though I tasted and loved the streetfood of Chinatown and Bugis, I started to yearn for good ol steak and salad and pasta and let's just say non oriental food.I discovered Marche thru a friend and I like it. Though pricey, the food selections are excellent. I ordered rib eye steak and ginger beer. I tasted my other friends' orders the german sausage platter, carbonara pasta, and the DIY salad. All are good. Considering it's a Chinese New Year and most shops and restos are closed in SG, Marche is a welcome relief.
3
I have been there few times already. The food is well displayed. Probably very good for asian but for me it doesnt taste as l expect. I found the pasta /sea food over cooked and ingredients tasteless.Sandwices and fresh juices are good.The ambience is nice and the staff is ok
4
With so many choices of food available, everyone in the family can enjoy a meal of their choice or order to share. From memory Marche has been the first store to offer such concept and their food has never failed to satisfy everyone.
5
The food is freshly made and is also served freshly served. The seafood section has a lot of variety
3
Its my first time to eat in the restaurant. It was refreshingly good.
What I didn't like about the meal I had was the mashed potato is too dry for my liking.
The food was alright.
4
I wish we had these in Bangkok, the equivalent doesn't come close. It was a feast for the eyes and mouth. My only thing was that the kids menu came with no dishes that contained vegetables and they only offered juice or pop as beverages. If this is supposed to be the healthy choice kind of place, that should include kids as well. Kid friendly should also mean healthy for kids... provide some simple cut up fruit and vegetable options and definitely milk and water to drink! The service was alright... I had to wait a while to get service for drinks as it was around 5 when we got there... clearly a little early, and the prices were a bit much, but I guess it would be normal for Singapore standards. But I would recommend it and go back again
4
There's lots of selections, but it's a bit overpriced with the taxes on top as a regular lunch place.Great if you want the crepes which are probably the best deal in the place, but salads or meat are small for what you're paying for.Service is pretty good.Oh, but your super slippery floors are a huge hazard. Not sure what can be done about that
4
Went to Marche just now. As usual, rosti is perfect with generous amount of sour cream. Had my usual crepes with mascarpone cheese and this time not so generous amount of mascarpone. The desserts look excitingly tempting. They add in the high chairs for high tables which look more comfortable than the previous chairs. The deli by the entrance looks good. Will be back again for rost
4
Had a lunch with colleagues here and I'm surprised how this resto works. You have a wide variety of choices. They also using a card system when ordering and that's so cool! I ordered ceasar salad with smoked salmon and that's superb! Wil be going back here when I'm back in SG as this is just near our SG office
4
Came across this restaurant quite by chance and as we had eaten in the Orchard Road one, went in for lunch. Great of variety of food and even though it was very busy, there was the minimum of time waiting. Great entertainment value watching the chefs toss the rosti! Enjoyable meal and we also ate here the next evening with some friends
4
First time i had a good lunch in suntec. Decided to try out marche as it really looked tempting from outside. They are using card system so you only pay after you've done eating to your heart's content.I had rosti with a bowl of mushroom gravy which eventually cost me $15..
3
Went to Marche in suntec city last evening, ordered 1 chicken pizza, potato swiss rosti cum Pork sausage. the food is just alright, nothing fantastic. but it does have a kids corner for you to enjoy your meals while your little ones run around wild there
4
Met up with some old friends whilst in town (so 2 families of 4). Very impressed with the selection and service. Can get pricey if you get carried away as your tab gets charged electronically as you select items.
5
A great place for Healthy Food. A hawker system with a difference. Lots of choices of really healthy fresh options. Always really busy though at peak times.
4
Loved the sheer variety of options available and at times does become a little difficult to choose from. Worked as a great place for the kids to play and adults to just sit around and chill for an extended period.
4
This came by surprise, didn't expect it to be good but it is. Your choice and your fiod can be selected differently and in the quantity that you want at a certain counter. It gets full during lunch and dinner so be prepared.
3
First time being at the Suntec outlet. We ordered two main dishes, a grilled chicken and pasta. Both prepared quite amateurishly. We stopped eating halfway. Overall the cost for two person with another two more dishes came to $60. I found it quite expensive for the food.
3
Marche has lost its appeal over the years and have certainly dulled down the 'market place experience' - it used to be the go to place 10 years go. Not anymore. Food quality has dropped quite a bit and the cooks are ruder and not as friendly as they used to be. Marche Suntec is small and average. No real motivation to visit. The one at Somerset would be a better choic
5
The stuff at marche suntec Singapur were so friendly hosting me that i went there every day at least once. Their quality and presentation of food is excellent. Fresh and delishes homemade soups, and my favorite Desserts were creme brullee and chocolate fudge cake with MÃ¶venpick coffee and their famous icecream. Yammmie........ sharing your experiences, you're helping travelers make better choices and plan their dream trips. Thank you

Is a lovely place for food. Shall be the heaven of healthy meal! Boss got us all there for a welcome meal, interesting is that the service was good and the food is greater! (Not because is free aka treat by our boss) BUT? The standard is indeed maintained compare to the one I tried at Summerset. Salad is totally a mind blow for lunch, large portion and tasty! Well done! Sure be back for more meal
3
Came here for lunch a few times recently. There's a good selection of meal options, but you do need to pay some attention to the pricing structure in order to avoid a nasty surprise gouging on the way out. Food is good and getting a seat at lunchtime doesn't seem to be an issue
4
Beyond the sandwich/deli area is a sit down dining area with a huge display of fresh food which offers something for everyone, with a great range of seafood, meats, salads, beverages- all served with a bit of a Swiss twist, as might be expected from Movenpick. The freshly cooked rosti dishes, with a range of interesting accompaniments, were a real winner for me and seemed to be especially popular with the locals from the adjacent Suntec Centre Towers. Having a dining venue as good as this on the premises is such a bonus, as dishes are all very reasonably priced and the self-service system where you use you entry card to record your charges and settle when exiting adds to the overall efficiency, if time is short. Worth a visit, especially for a decent, value-for-money lunch
