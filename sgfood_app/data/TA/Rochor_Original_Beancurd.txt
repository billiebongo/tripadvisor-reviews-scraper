A perfect stop over for a light supper.
Extra seating are available on the 2nd level. Cheap and fresh too!
5
I love this place. I just love it. I tried it last week and I already came back for more. Both cold and warm are amazing. Service is not fantastic but food is worth it. I'm coming for more soon!
5
Tasted the cold beancurd, eggtart, and you tiao..and it taste really really good. Took the wrong subway exit at bugis,so we walked quite far from the place. Should've exit at rochor instead.
3
Tried this place again after a few years especially since I moved closer to the city. Unfortunately, I think other places (e.g. Geylang) are much better than this outlet along Short Street. Soya Bean drinks are watered down and the fritters soggy.
3
came here for some more beancurd recently. It's still very cheap at just $1.50 a serving, and the beancurd is just as tasty as on previous visits. They don't ever seem to make any improvements to the appearance of the venue though.
4
Their snacks are good and cheap.
Try their beancurd , soya bean drink and egg tarts .
All their foods are crispy and tasty.
5
Visited it's branch at Simpang Bedok. It's $1.20 per bowl now. There's many flavours now, but the original still the best. Slightly queue expected.
Sweet, smooth and tasty, really worth the dollar. Enjoyed every mouth of it.
2
The place is a typical shop selling bean curd and other Chinese tidbits to snack on. The bean curd is actually quite nice and smooth. However, the service is very bad. The person selling the bean curd seems to be over worked and very tired. But that should not be an excuse being in the F&B line. Improve your service and the rating should increase accordingly
4
Everything was there, just go and grab. I ordered a cold soy milk and bean curd. Was so nice at hot sunny day or after a long walk. The beancurd could be smoother. The taste wise was excellent. Just try to take away. THe place is beisde a small street so a lot of roach.
3
The last time I have had a beancurd at this place was 5 years ago, and it still tastes pretty much the same. I don't think anything's changed here, the variety of foods stays the same, the service is still terrible (if you can't speak Mandarin), and the beancurd is still good. A very happy visit down to the memory lane indeed
3
Came back here after a gap of 5+ years to try the beancurd. All quite tasty and didn't have to wait too long. I'll be back again.
5
Great beancurd for dessert that reminded my wife of her Chinese childhood where she and her grandfather would eat beancurd together. It is a nice local place that is cheap and fun if you like trying the less commercial options.
5
Best beancurd and soya bean milk stall in Singapore. Expect long queues during weekends. Very popular in Singapore. Prices are inexpensive.
4
For me almost any bean curd tastes the same. I like this place because it's near a hilly park and in a arguably quiet area. They also sell egg tart, which I find tasty enough.
4
I visited this place twice during my four day-stay in Singapore. Bean curd is very popular in Singapore, the texture is smooth, soft and glides down your throat.
5
By far the best beancurd I ever had for many years. The serving is fast even with the never ending long queue. Taste wouldn't turn bad even if you take away. Highly recommended.
4
Like its name suggests, Rochor Original Beancurd specialises in the sweet Asian beancurd dessert and it didn't disappoint. We rocked up on a midweek night and it was still buzzing with customers. The beancurd can be served hot or cold. Slightly firm with a smooth texture, the cold beancurd was an excellent and refreshing dessert. They also serve soymilk and a variety of fried snacks like youtiao (dough sticks) and egg tarts. Ambience and service might be lacking, but it's a trade off I'm willing to make for this dessert
4
The beancurd, soy milk, you tiao (fried dough sticks) and hum jing peng (salted pancake) are must try items. The Portuguese egg tarts are also nice and sweet. However, speaking any language other than Mandarin will reduce your ordering method to pointing and hand gestures. When it gets crowded, the staff get a lot less patient too.
4
This is my go-to pleace whenever I am craving for Tau Huay (Bean Curd)! Its located in town, near Sophia Road/ Dhoby Ghaut, so I will swing by if I am in the area.If I am driving, I will double park, jump out of the car and into the car in minutes. The bean curd is really smooth and glides down your throat. The portions are just enough without being too much to finish all by yourself. The store will have pre-packed take-away plastic containers ready to go. You can ask for less syrup, which I did on this occasion and I find the sweetness is just right. This is a good to control sugar intake, cos most times the syrup will always be left unfinished. You can also order the fried dough sticks (You Tiao) and the egg tarts
4
We are fortunate to live quite near here. We normally drop by quite late of a weekend evening, and it is always busy, both with customers eating/drinking there, and those taking out. There's a real mix of customers. The serving staff work efficiently and the queue moves quickly. We nearly always sit outside on the pavement, although occasionally we sit at one of the few tables inside at the back which affords a good view of a staff member making you tiao etc. It seems to us the staff take turns with this job. There is also a room upstairs, we've never been up there, it's largely used by youngsters. It has to be said the place is tatty. But, more importantly, the hot bean curd with syrup and freshly made you tiao (our favourite order here) are consistently very good, and the prices are very reasonable, eg roughly $1.20 for a standard beancurd, $1 for a you tiao. It's advisable to stick to what they do best eg the curry puffs and portuguse tarts are not so special. Plenty of regulars come here, it's a bit of an institution, and many make a fair journey to do so. It's well worth it
5
The smooth, offwhite soyabeancurd of Rochor is one of the best I've tasted. The the soya usually they added soya milk for more creamier taste. Must try!
5
The beancurd is smooth as silk and pure in taste. 100% soybean taste. The you tiao, ham chim peng n butterfly are to-die-for. Dough is compact, not too oily n have very full flavour.
4
It's best to try out HOT beancurd. It's smooth and taste Great ! Even their soy milk taste really fresh made on the spot. Love it a lot !
4
The beancurd here is to die for. The place is a little shabby. I would come back for more. Probably the best beancurd i've ever had.
4
I love beancurd, and this is the best I have tasted. The texture is smooth, soft and glides down your throat. Ask to add soyabean water into your beancurd for an extra oomph. It goes well with fried dough fritters too - just dip it like Oreos! ;) There is seating in the backlane, but I am terrified of the lizards plastered on the wall...well beats not having a place to sit I guess. Will risk for good beancurd
4
This is the first time that I've tasted a hot beancurd. It tastes really good even though it has no colored syrup. The presentation is simple yet appetizing to the eye. I also ordered glassjelly juice and surprisingly it was not bitter (not like in other stores). The price is affordable and I would definitely recommend it to my friends
4
i was not a fan of soya bean. but i came up to like this place and its soya bean drink. the tofu is great. wiiih too much to mention. the yeoteow and tried all the fried stuff in this shop. its all great. should stop by if you were in this neighbourhood. wont regret i
4
I visited this place twice during my four day-stay in Singapore. Had different things, and liked all of them. The beancurd dessert is very smooth and the soymilk is very fresh. I also really liked the butterfly pastry, which was really delicious! They have outdoor seating and indoor seating upstairs - suggest going indoor for the air condition and to avoid the busy street. Get a seat first before buying
5
A relative mentioned the Rochor beancurd whilst we were out having Singapore chilli crab and carrot cake. I didn't think much of it as I figured it's only 'tauhuay', how good can it actually get? As we were staying around the corner and on the way back from Sands casino one night, a nice cabbie ran through with us some of the good food around the area and he mentioned the beancurd. Great, it was down the road from our hotel, so he stopped me there at 1am to buy tauhuay. I have never had such smooth tauhuay in my 32 years on Earth and I thought maybe it's time I move to Singapore for their good food. We had this every night when we were in Singapore. It was simply beancurd with quality. The Malaysian version is far from this
3
We were about to have dinner at the chicken rice shop at corner of Middle Road/Short Street and saw a queue a few doors away. Queues usually meant something worth lining up for, so we decided to pop over later. Tau huay for the day - some like it hot (bean curd) and some like it cold (iced soy bean drink) plus cruellers and fritters (fried dough) - salty and sweet versions. We had a bowl each of tau huay plus a salty version of fritter (5-spice flavour) to share. The bean curd was silky smooth with a fragrant aroma of soybean. The fritter was soft & chewy - light golden colour with a slight crisp for the covering. No oily taste or residue on the fingers. Self-service ie. order at the counter, pay and carry your tray to whichever table available (on the 5-foot-way, roadside or backlane in front of the rubbish bin - our table). One serving lady at the counter was pretty rude - perhaps 'cos I looked Chinese yet didn't speak Mandarin. So much for service with a smile. Best an evening or night visit with the outdoor seating, too hot during the day. Else a take-away. Btw, there's another tau huay shop next door - not so many customers though
3
This food is simple but very effective in cooling down your body with the Singapore's climate.... Beancurd is very popular in SG and you can easily find it in either in stores,food courts or restaurants. this one is not very special compares to other beancurd.
4
The Beancurd is very fine and tender but the amount is getting smaller with the same price.Most expensive is the Youtiao, which charges the same price as the beancurd.
5
Singapore's best beancurd! We love it so much, after eating we always do take aways! smooth beancurd & not too sweet. You can taste the mild frangrance of the beancurd. Absoultely fabulous.
4
The beancurd is really soft and smooth. Always very crowded. The only problem is limited parking space around.
5
The beancurd is really soft and smooth. One of the best that I have tasted! There are so many different brands of beancurds in Singapore ,,, you can actually find a stall selling them almost anywhere, but my favorite is still this place.
3
Not so to my liking. Soft and sweet but a bit sticky to me. Still quite popular with locals and tourists. Good to snack on for a quick break and enjoy the soft and slippery dessert. Very limited seats so just eat-and-go or have the beancurd taken away. Slight air pollution as cars could be parked directly infront of the stall. Sometimes there would be queue but usually it's quite fast
5
I've never heard of beancurd before... but I'm glad I took a chance to find out what it is! I went around 3pm. No line. Just stopped in, got a warm bowl of beancurd and one of the long fried pastries. Delicious!Only complaint is the cars parking right in front of the store are very obnoxious. Probably better to take away and go to a nearby park
4
eating beancurd always reminds me of my grandmother who used to buy it for us as breakfast when we were little kids, going over to her place to stayover. a local delight, so healthy so yummy. and rochor beancurd is definitely one of the best and long surviving in singapore. love it.
4
my first time to try this dessert. we arrived at 10 pm but still queing. the place is good for hang out, especially for young people before heading home. the beancurd is very delicious, soya milk also very tasty together with cakwe. recomended dessert. i dont know about the service since my friend was queing for me
1
The food is great, but the services from the China ladies are very rude. They shout at customers. Maybe, the owners are now famous and do not care too much, as there will always be customers. This is very different from the earlier days when the owners themselvs come out to serve the customers all the from the early ays at Middle Road, etc
4
I'm a regular of Rochor beancurd for over 2 decades and their standards have been fairly consistent. Great for a late night snack or supper.
5
Bean curd craze aside, this stil makes a great supper place!
5
This is how beancurd should be like, not the newfangled custard types. I love that this is simple. It melts in your mouth and you get to control the amount of syrup that goes in. It's best eaten warm. AND, only a dollar per bowl!
2
i think the old staff made u feel like going back for more
but this few times i see only rude staff around
5
a great place to go if you're craving for beancurb in the late night. it opened till quite night and the beancurb are smooth. the egg tarts are the must try food there.
5
Craving for bean curd anyone? @ Rochor bean curd you can practically eat it any time. One can choose to eat it plain or eat it with the dough stick just like they do in Taiwan. The prices are also reasonable.
4
not the cheapest to be honest. but it somehow tastes better than anywhere else. could be the moments.... it's by the side of a street, the queue making everyone thinks it is good.... I just love it there.
5
Love the beancurd, smooth and thick texture. not like artificial 'soya jelly' from the ubiquitous 'bean' chain stalls.
The soya bean drink is a wee bit sweet, for a sweet tooth person like me. So remember to ask for less sugar.
3
The beancurd itself is very smooth and nice. Remember you need to reduce the amount of syrup. It is super sweet to me as I din know they put so much and it actually make the beancurd taste no good as too sweet.I will be back for the less sweet version but dun expect too much of the services
5
I would usually packet the bean curd as the place is always crowded. The bean curd is smooth as silk. Never fail to disappoint! When I have friends visting Singapore, I will bring them here to experience sitting in the back alley to eat the bean curd and yu tiao. You don't get to experience this in many other places in Singapore now
3
The daohuay here is delicious smooth and sweet.
With their range of other snacks like youtiao, sesame seed coated glutinous balls, egg tarts, its good for a visit any time of the day.
The attitude of the service staff can be better though..
4
Must confess they are very skillful. Really impressve. Feeling so smooth inside. Just a bit noisy.
3
Smoonth beancurds ;-)
3
Well, basically a place popular with youngsters who hangs out late around selegie area. Decent beancurd at reasonable price but you are either sitting outside the shop near the road (still ok) or behind the side alley.
2
The quality has dropped over the years.. it's still an ok place
5
I have been patronising this stall since goodness when??? The quality is still as good. Texture is, to me, the most important aspect of a good bean curd and theirs is as smooth as silk.
4
One of the better beancurd in S'pore
4
All the soybean products here are superlative. This is an OLD and WELL KNOWN place amongst local Singaporeans. There are actually two bean curd places right next to each other. I think they are both good, but Rochor Original is the famous one.If it's busy, get ready to shout your order in English to someone who can't understand you (Chinese, non-Singaporean) Don't bother to be polite or smile, they won't either. Just make yourself understood, pay and get your stuff for take away. There is very limited seating and it's not a nice place to sit even if you get a place
4
Rochor bean curd is my comfort food after a long day at work. I visit this shop at Short Street at least once a week in the evening and have a bowl of bean curd (for one Singapore dollar) and occasionally, a pair of fried fritters. The bean curd is silky and of just the right texture. It is served in a disposable plastic bowl with a sealed cover together with a disposable plastic spoon. The quality of the fritters varies - best to catch it when it is just fried. The servers are mainly lady workers from the PRC who can understand a smattering of English.The setting is quaint and rustic. Seats are available inside the shop on the ground floor, upstairs as well as outdoors. As this is not a 5-start hotel at Orchard Road, please do not expect marble floors and pristine seating conditions.Don't mistake this for the shop next door which also sells bean curd and related food. I understand that there is some sort of common family background between the two shops. The Rochor Original Beancurd is at the shop located at the corner. It now has a couple of branches elsewhere e.g. Upper Thomson Road
4
I am a big big fan of beancurd and I can safely say this is the best beancurd in Singapore! Extremely silky and goes down very well. A dough stick or two would be perfect to go with the beancurd. The servers are however not very polite. But who cares about service when you get to eat such a delicacy? A must try for locals and foreigners alike
5
Oh my... my favourite Beancurd anytime! You can even get this as desserts for late nites!
4
Smooth Beancurd, light puffy bread sticks. Comfort food at any time and who can argue with the pricing?
4
this IS the original, evident from its taste.
4
Smooth & silky. Can keep in fridge for 3-4 days. Ate them regularly during my pregnancies.
3
Can't really differentiate it from those supermarket soya milk
4
go there for the food it serves, not the ambience! Really smooth beancurd!
4
Real smooth and will slide down your throat! One of the best, if not the best! They have been making it for more than 30 years. Other stuff available include chin chow, dumpling (水晶包) and ang-ku kueh.
3
Really nice beancurd. Smooth.
5
yum! always buy tow huay for supper =D
4
Hot, cold, beancurd to soya milk. Every bit of silkiness and smoothness is enjoyed in every mouth!!
5
Smooth, silky beancurd.. not too sweet! Best served hot.
3
Nice for light supper, great for a short drink after movies at PS / PictureHouse
1
Overrated. Try the one at Geylang.
4
very nice texture and taste. got to know this place courtesy of Ryan...
4
Must admit, they are good at what they do.
5
Smoothest beancurd in Singapore!
3
Very smooth Beancurd !
Once a while will see patrons from very expensive sports / good cars parking along the road outside this small old shop to eat its Beancurd for night dessert too.
4
Real smooth......melts away in your mouth. Love it!
5
soft and silky tofu..best !!
5
The beancurd's texture is simply out of this world!
5
Good!
5
Excellent - my local
3
1 of the better stores but not fantastic!
5
Best in singapore as certified by Chew Wei da Expert in eating Toufu
5
I just love that smoothness of their beancurd...
4
Not so cheap but worth very penny
4
warm smooth daohuay + 'shui' + youtiao = WOOHOO!
It's an ideal breakfast/supper place (:
4
Smooooth
4
Melt in the mouth bean curd dessert
4
can't get enough of this. smooth & alittle too much sugar syrup given everytime..S$1 a bowl is on the high side for a bowl of beancurd,eating in by the way. i love this particular stall only. but i dont like the idea of eating it in plastic containers at night,which are recycled numerous times as long as its not a take away order. i like it when they serve in the hard plastic bowl with a metal spoon..nostalgic
4
Good and incredibly cheap
3
still the best place to go to after a late night out with friends for tau hway and an oily hot you tiao fresh from the wok
4
nice (=
4
The ORIGINAL...very soft and smooth...melts in your mouth...orgasmic!! Mmmmm
4
beancurd is soft m texture just right.. nice..
4
beancurd is smooth but pretty costly
3
As smooth as silken tofu...sit outside near the drain..authentic touch!
2
Standard has dropped... you have been warned.
3
the nicest beancurd so far
4
I've lost count of the number of times we've swung by here en route home late at night to buy the dou hua for either supper or breakfast. Make sure you go to the shop on the right and not its rival next door. Their dou hua is so so smooth
4
Just the right sweetness, smooth as silk...
3
Good night supper place
5
Best beancurd in Singapore
3
Really smooth beancurd... but got to eat near yucky and smelly back alley..
2
Why do beancurds always leave that sour after taste and tongue coat no matter how smooth they've been made? Did I eat bad beancurd?
5
One of my favourite snack hangouts!
5
Cheap and good. Favourite.
4
Nice and smooth beancurd
5
Absolute favourite
4
The smmmmoooooothest beancurd ever eaten...Die DIe Must Try....But service aunties attitude...Quick eat & go venue, not one to stay long... Be there & you'll know why....
3
shadow of its former self
3
Done just the right way, albeit crowded and commercial for a beancurd.
4
Soft and Smooth :p Yummmy!
4
one of the supper hang out spot before going home
5
Nice, cheap, smooooth touhua....a filling and not calorie laden supper/ snack. =)
3
nice n smooth, melts in your mouth
4
Family Business. 2 side by side. Nice bean curd. Reasonable price.
5
Super Duper NICE!!!!
4
Best beancurd
3
Not bad, still good
4
always park on street-side enjoying the addictive bean curd or soya milk while waiting for daughter to finish NAFA class.
5
I love rocher tau huey! Best tau huey in Singapore! Supper digouts after late night projects at nearby SMU.
4
smoothest beancurd I had tried so far. simply metls in your mouth
3
Not too bad ...
4
Needless to say
4
Beancurd is nice and smooth but the lady boss' face really stinks like smelly beancurd too!
4
Very Smooth!
5
Silky beancurd literally slides down your throat...yum!
3
Nice and smoothe bean curd, parking is easier than the one in Geylang.
4
Many babes ...
3
Could have a smoother texture..
5
Melts in your mouth!
5
the only tau hauy i will eat... the tau huay is very smooth to go down the throat!
4
The fried dough sticks are pretty neat. The beancurd is smooth and soft.
3
Great traditional Tou Fu Fa with a twist - golden red syrup
4
Smoother than toufu.
4
Smoothest Beancurd I have ever tasted in my life
4
bagus...smooth smooth
4
oh yum yum... especially when the beancurd is eaten together with the yao chao kuai :P slurp...
4
a regular haunt we've introed to all our movie-buddies. The beancurd texture is unrivaled in Singapore, but they could tone down on the syrup psychedelicity
