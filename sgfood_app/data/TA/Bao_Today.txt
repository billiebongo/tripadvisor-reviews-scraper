Bao and the shrimp I tried tasted nice, price is reasonable around 4-5 SGD for a plate good enough for one person.
Its a small place on Orchard road with a nice feel to it and serves food real quick.

We were walking past feeling a little hungry so we stopped in for some dim sum. Very fresh produce and the food was great. We didn't try everything on the menu by what we did was delicious.

We had breakfast recently at Bao Today. The seats were uncomfortable and did not have any backs on them. The food was decent, average, and came out fairly quickly upon ordering. Service was average.
4
Delicious Prawn and pork dumplings with yummy sauces. Service very quick and hot food. Reasonably priced.
4
Despite all the reviews the food here was actually really good and it comes hot. If you have been to Ping Pong in London itâ€™s a similar concept. The food is quick however the servers were not particularly polite. I really enjoyed the Golden Sand I was very apprehensive but was glad I tried it.

Went for dinner on a Saturday night. It was quite crowded at the @313 outlet, great location on Orchard. The menu is quite extensive and very reasonably priced. Service was more of a fast food restaurant quality but efficient enough, albeit not overly friendly. The dim sum was quite enjoyable, but the dumplings could have been a bit hotter. No ginger and vinegar to dip, but they bring some vinegar if you ask for it. We also particularly enjoyed the golden sand bao and the black sesame bao, although the latter was a bit too runny. I didn't care to much for the century egg porridge, was pretty flavorless, But the wonton soups were good, plenty of wontons. My favorite though were the steamed prawn rolls, good flavor, good amount of shrimp, but sesame topping would have been nice. Overall I would come back for a quick dim sum fix

The good thing is that they serve dim sum even for dinner so if you're not that hungry this is a suitable option. We tried a variety of the usual dim sum; food was ok, prices reasonable, service more like a fast food eatery. Not worth a second visit for me.

After hectic shopping along Orchard Road we stopped at Bao Today in Somerset 313 shopping mall for small bites. Lively atmosphere being outdoor, good place for people watching too! Lovely menu with mainly Tim Sum and noodles. The food is delicious and service is good and fast. But the waiters could do with a smile!! Price is very reasonable for Orchard. Look out for the recommendation in the menu, it's a must try!

Was there after a birthday celebration and feeling a little hungry. Decided to drop by as most of the restaurants were closed at that time. It didn't matter if the food was not up to standard, just needed something to tame that tummy.Food came and it really wasn't THAT bad, just average and very much like the food you get at Westgate's Tim Ho Wan without the pretentious attitude of staff and long queue.Really nothing to rave about but it does fill the tummy, in a mall around 10pm if you ever need it
3
We were there as it opened when other places were closed in preparation for the evening serving. We have tried the fish porridge, bean curd skin wrapped chicken roll and prawn dumpling with soya milk. The soya milk was ok but the rest of the dishes were not the best we had. Fish was a bit fishy not as fresh as we hoped it to be. It's a convenient place to have food and the service was friendly enough. Food on the other hand is nothing out of the ordinary
3
OK place for a quik lunch or dinner. Main dish was not warm enough. Price is ok. Was not that I regret eating there, but would not go again with so many other and better options around.
3
I had lunch at Bao Today. I ate there before but I was disappointed by this last visit. The dim sums were disappointing. The service was OK. The prices were reasonable.
3
Honestly do not have too high expectation of food.the porridge lunch set at 6.50.. It consist of porridge,iced lemon tea and a dessert which varies.for myself i ordered the mango puddingNothing to scream about the porridge.just a small takeaway disposable bowl just suitable for me.porridge was okay only with bits of chicken century egg and fried wanton skin..i ordered fried shrimp rolls which was quite good at 2.50 for 3..the pastry was fried to golden brown and look very appetising..pudding was sweet and quite big as compared to other puddings elsewhere
1
Horrible low quality food. Slow service too. Char Siew rice come with 4 measly piece of char siew. Black pepper pork chop is hard. Braised pork tasted like leftover. Only another 2 tables at the restaurant n they took 25 mins to give us our food
3
Average place for quick bites. Nothing spectacular, but it's not lousy either. The famous bao, is not too bad but if that's their main selling point it's kind of a letdown. But no high expectations since it's cheap food. XO noodles are pretty much just instant noodles with extra egg and luncheon meat. from a HK perspective it's lousy food, perhaps just modified to cater the local crowd

Me and my wife had lunch at Bao Today located at Level 2 of the Marina Square Shopping Mall, Singapore. The restaurant layout is small but have sufficient items on its’ menu for a reasonably meal. We ordered a Braised Beef Brisket Noodle, a pot of Porridge and some Dim Sum. The staff service was good and food was served within good time. We enjoyed our meal at Bao Today as the food and the restaurant ambient was pretty pleasant
4
We came to Bao today a couple of nights ago when we were in Singapore. We happened to stay at the Rendezvous Hotel so we only had to go down the stairs to get to the restaurant.The dim sum were really good... Noodles were delicious as well... Very good tasting food in this restaurant and to top it all off, it was very reasonably priced. Loved it
4
If you are very hungry I would recommend you order 6 dishes for 2 people. It works out at about £2.50 per dish so it really is very economical.Don't get me wrong, it's not corden bleu but it'[s okThe service was very quick and there were no serviettes, fortunate I had some hand wipes in my bag.Sometimes the tables are properly wiped clean and it is a bit basic but the staff are pleasant enough.Would I go again for a cheap quick meal - Sure

1.) The Dim Sum Buffet do not have 40 types as advertised. Factoring the drinks there is only 21 types. Most of the items are stale, cold, oily (If Deep fry), over-seasoned and hard in texture2.) Most items will end up with a "Sorry, we ran out of this item XXXX"3.) A few items can be ordered more than once at least its hot and ok for a choosy eater like me, e.g. Kongbak Bao, Charsiew Pao, Siewmai, Hargow4.) Waiting staff was a real hit and miss. A lady server don;t even seem interested in anything and give you a "Whatever, Whichever, Don't care" look and replies. The other young man was very well-mannered, always checking if things were ok and apologizes again when item ran out which was mentioned by the lady with a " no more already" and she simply walk away. A pity didn't get the male waiter name, he deserves praise. Bespectacled tall and well-mannered.Overall rating: No go, I am rating average for the sake of the waiter

Better than Fast food.. You get your food fast! Hot, as ordered and at comparable prices.... Dim Sum or other dishes with desert to enjoy. Would go back again.. Table setting inside the entrance, has it own designated area for service.. walked by many times during our visit as was always busy
5
Affordable prices, great menu of variety of soups, noodles and dim sum, strategically located and great food. Always enjoyed and look forward to more. Well done!

I was hoping for something fabulous as I was starving but it turned out to be okay. I had a curried dish with chicken and it was nothing remarkable. My companion had a standard noodle dish. Okay.
3
Good dumplings, and springrolls. The meat in the noodle dish was like gum, and it was to much fat. Looked clean and the staff was friendly.
3
Try the baked sea food cheese rice.....very nice. Other dishes ok. Ice teas very strong..........open till late.

Went for the dim sum buffet at hotel rendezvous , the variety is about 18-20 dishes. The waiters will bring the food to your table, you just need to tell them the quantity you need. It is definitely filling as you can reorder the dishes. However the taste of the food is just so-so like those dim sum you can find in hawker center. Nothing special. They do not serve porridge only glutinous rice. Drinks wise like plain ice water, peach tea and lemon tea are free flow. Other drinks are chargeable. Ambiance is ok like any other restaurant. Staff attitude is good
5
Stopped here for something to eat after a night flight which left us feeling shattered. We did not want to wander too far from our hotel (Jen Orchardgateway) for something to eat as we were tired and wanted some eastern food so we plumped for Bao Today. Good choice. The service was quick and pleasant and the food was excellent. Would recommend for lunch to anyone passing through Orchard Mall, even worth a diversion from Orchard Road
3
This place we went to at 12 am. Taking a walk down Orchard looking for food on our first day. Crossing Ion we reached Somerset where we found this place open. Very limited options but the beef ramen was nice. Dim sums were ok. There was some other Prawns Noodle. Open air sit down. Like a refined food stall. Not a must go. But maybe if its a last minute option.
4
Though the service was very slow but the food is pretty good. We had some dim sum, noodle as well as rice and all of them turned out very tasty. Only didn't like the ting ting noodle as the texture is like instant noodle but I must say the chilli sauce is good.
3
~we came at about 11am on a weekend, virtually empty opposite Jia Xiang Sarawak Kuching Kolo Mee...~Just 3 dishes, Har Kow, Cheong Fun with Char Siew & Prawns, all made fresh and served quick~service was friendly and fast, food was ok... it was the menu that amazed, looks just like a Hong Kong street deli, so we took other photos do check them out
3
The dim sums and noodles are actually quite tasty. Affordable price range, and okay atmosphere. However service are pretty nonexistent lol. Nonetheless, good for a quick lunch and if you happen to have a craving for dim sum. Given the price, I will say overall the food is above average. Worth a try
4
I went to the rendezvous hotel branch at past 1PM. Not crowded, ambiance was good and place is clean. Air Con too strong but I'm not sure if its centralised with the hotel building. Happy tummy nonetheless.
3
An average food outlet catering mainly to office workers and shoppers in the Marina Square area. Food includes noodles, dimsum, pao, rice,etc. Seating is rather limited, open and small. A good place for a fast eat.
3
had breakfast twice while visited Singapore, stayed at Gateway Jen Hotel, so it is quite convenient. Like the dimsum and noodles with beef brisket, the sauce can be a bit salty. overall is not bad.
3
Went by over the weekend to the Marina Square outlet for dinner. We had the main courses (barbequed pork noodles), and a variety of dim sum items including the BBQ pork rice roll, shrimp rice roll, several type of steam buns. For the pricing, the food was serviceable though finally nothing special. The rice rolls were in fact disappointing, and in our taste buds, less tasty than those one can get off a typical Kopitiam eatery. The buns which were a little better than given that seems to be this restaurant's specialization. All in, there are better dining places in Marina Square than this for the price range, but if you must have dim sum, then this place is worth a visit - just temper your expectations
2
This place was just a dumbed down version of Din Tai Fung. They serve the same style dumplings but are very much inferior. The service was also very poor. While the price is slightly lower than Din Tai Fung, save your money and splurge. You will not be disappointed.

Drop by for a quick lunch with a business associate. Not a great place for a business meeting but a great place for a quick and tasty meal. I had eaten here a few times before and love their beef stew noodles. Portion is pretty small for S8.90++. Their assorted meat pau, the one where you can see the meat on top of the bun is awesome. However, the wanton soup was a disappointment. 6 miserable wonton, in very plain tasting soup. Not worth the S$6.90++. I will still visit them when I am in Singapore but will try other dishes and a reminder to myself, do not order the wanton soup.Oh btw, they will take your orders at your table but you need to go to the cashier to settle your bill
3
Taste really not bad. Have come here for few times jus fot a quick lunch. Ever order char siew noodle and latest visit order teriyaki chicken with rice.The portion really small according to me. Need to order side dishes such as steamed bun.Waiting time is about 10 mins approximate on each visit. Waiter is quite friendly and efficient

Bao Today seems out of place amongst the glitz of the designer stores - it is a modest, outdoor plaza seating dim sum restaurant. Two of us ate there on 4 mornings between 8 and 9am and always found a seat, though the place was busy at times. Sit down, grab your order sheet and supplied pencil and peruse the menu - note down your table number and tick off the items you want. Breakfast dim sum and bao costs range around 4-5 Sing$; for two people four items and green tea were ample. Everything was good, the shrimp snappingly fresh, the crystal bao hot and sweet, and the mango and shrimp crisp and hot. Breakfast for two, quick, made to order, delicious and all for about Sig$22
4
At 10 PM most Singapore restaurants close. If you are jet-lagged and hungry after 10, go to Bao Today. We visited the location at 313 Somerset. Excellent Hong Kong style Dim Sum dishes served fast and hot. The staff are not always proficient with English, but a picture menu makes up for that. We will definitely be back

Having dim sum or yum cha on one's own is always a challenge - servings too large or dish that is too heavy is always the challenge. Came across Bao Today on my most recent visit to Singapore and given the portion sizes decided to give it a go...ordered 3 dishes each with a portion size of 3 pieces and felt that with the diversity of the dishes this would suffice, add a beer and I thought I was in Asian heaven..that said there was very little flavour difference in the profile of the three dishes ordered..a deep fried shrimp dumpling, steamed mushroom dumplings and a supposed scallop dish that was dominated by an unexpecte prawn... effecient service, well priced, not sure I would rush to get back given all that Singapore has to offer.
