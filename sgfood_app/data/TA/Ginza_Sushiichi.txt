I think it’s normal feeling and look forward to coming back again in the future.
I wish it’s getting better and better.

We have been to the same restaurant in Tokyo and Bangkok, but the experience in this particular Ginza Sushiichi was definitely the best. Whether it's the freshness of the seafood or the overall experience, it was absolutely memorable! We were lucky to have the Head Chef prepare our dinner for us, and boy, was it a happy experience. The fish, abalone and uni was just perfection, and the Head Chef was so happy and entertaining, it was a dinner that we will not forget. I'm already missing it !

food was fabulous - we had the nigiri Omakase and enjoyed everything that was served, which was well handled by our sushi chef. Also a nice touch that they provided a candle and a nicely plated dessert tray as it was my husband's birthday. However, they get 4 stars instead of 5 because they missed out on serving us two dishes which were apparently standard fare across all their set menus - the uni+ikura mini don and the miso soup. The don was served after dessert, and only because we asked whether it was only served in other set menus - and the manager then realised it hadn't been served. Only after we were done with the don did we then realise that miso soup was also not served. By then we had lost our appetite for the offered serving of miso soup. Unfortunately, this incident has left an additional lingering memory of the restaurant being "what else could they have missed out on?". We still paid full price and will likely return for the food, but service recovery could potentially have been better for a Michelin starred restaurant

Warm welcome by staff (Josiah & Bibi) and 34-year-old executive Head Chef Masakazu Ishibashi, more affectionately known as Masa who could speak English (having been in Singapore for 4 Years).Food is exquisite and fresh and there is variety. In fact Chef Masa boosted that he could cook any Japanese fare if given sufficient notice.Typical Japanese zen-like environment and hospitality

We would definitely visit Ginza Sushi-ichi again, probably on the next special day. We went to this sushi bar to celebrate the end of our world trip from US, Germany, Switzerland, Dubai before going back to Japan. This sushi bar, on the first floor of Marriott, gave us an unforgettable experience. Unlike noisy restaurants with many customers, this sushi bar had only I think 12 seats, and two sushi chefs behind the wooden counter, so we were treated like special guests. We had mackerel, tuna, prawn, sea urchin, crab, octopus, salmon roe, conger eel, and other fresh fish delivered from the fish market in Tokyo by air. Everything tasted so wonderful as it melted in the mouth. The sushi rice was firm but soft. Vinegar-tightened mackerel is not my favorite because it is usually sour and dry, but the one here was totally different from the ones I ate before elsewhere. It again melted in the mouth and it was tasty. The young chef was very skillful. He sliced every piece right in front of me. Just looking at his handling the knife was an entertainment. He didn’t forget sharing his knowledge about ingredients and how to prepare them. So we were intellectually satisfied, too. It’s not cheap, but I think the price is reasonable given all the ingredients are air transported and the chefs are top of the industry. The chef sent us off when we left. It is a memorable restaurant perfect for a special occasion

Awesome, amazing, superb and damn worth coming back for another anniversary. Haha. Just because we are not so rich. Else, we will come back often and regularly. We had the S$240 Omakase set lunch and it was Super delicious. Everything is fresh, sweet and well crafted by the Chef. Service is TOP notch too!Highly recommended

Firstly we did not actually have a meal in the restaurant itself but in the adjoining bar/lounge located just before the restaurant, which shares the same name, kitchen and therefore produce and chef as the restaurant.Here we had a wonderful meal one evening which turned out to be a "private dining" experience all by ourselves with only Michael the pleasant bartender/waiter as our host. Seated on low velvet couches we tried the Gotou udon course (SGD41++) and the Otoro (tuna belly) katsu couse (SGD49++). Michael informed us the produce was flown directly from Japan, and took us through each item in the sets. The food was very fresh, delicately prepared and delicious.We started with a sashimi of squid and white mackerel which was soft, smooth and delicate in flavour. Then a lovely aromatic chawanmushi (steamed egg custard) followed by our mains: one with udon noodles in broth and assorted tempura (nothing like the ordinary kind!) and an excellent chirashi (sashimi on rice) - but missing the miso soup component; the other of fried crumbed tuna belly slices that melted in the mouth, served with steamed Japanese rice, pickles, side dishes of tofu and daikon, and miso soup. We finished the set with two different sorbets - a yuzu citrus sorbet and a brown sugar sorbet: the yuzu was refreshing and lightly tangy while the brown sugar topped with black seaweed provided a caramel-esque contrast. A perfect ending to the meal journey.Thus a beautifully presented, truly delicious, harmonious and memorable meal at a relatively bargain price compared with the formal restaurant! Highly recommended!Tip: apparently the lunch sets are highly popular here; come for dinner and a more relaxed dining experience. All sets are limited to 5 each per day so best to book in advance

Food is good. Environment is good. Chef is friendly. And I can enjoy my meal quietly. Very good experience

The ginza sushi is a bit pricy but the material is fresh and service is satisfactory. If you are a super fan of Sushi, you may have a try

the restaurant is located in the mariott but is designed like a restaurant on the street. the food is good, but when it comes to high end sushi I think even on orchard road hashida is better.

Service is superb. Chef is very friendly and skillful when dealing with the sushi. The quality of food is not bad but seems overpriced. Have had more valuable lunch omakase before.

This is the best sushi in singapore, highly recommended, we were served by the junior chef, not the main chef. Will definitely visit again on my next trip and get the main chef to serve us.

Tried the omakase set dinner and it was really delicious. Price is slightly expensive but the location is really easy to find. And the chef is very friendly too. Will recommend to business dinner occasion.

Arriving slightly later than I had planned, my partner and I didn't have much trouble finding the sushi bar in Marriot Tang Plaza Hotel. We were greeted with the usual Japanese fanfare of hot tea and towelettes and soon proceeded to have the omakase at the discretion of the chef.Bringing out the (still functioning) hairy crab and a huge Hokkaido scallop intact with its shell, the friendly chef allowed some pictures and joked with us throughout the meal.Following a choice cut of sashimi and finely prepped appetizers, we were floored by the Bluefin Tuna chutoro. The single slab of fresh fish kept our glib tongues in our heads as we enjoyed the multitude of flavours unlocked within a single bite. Th e Hokkaido scallop was so fresh and generous that it almost tasted like the sea had presented its bounty to us.The hairy crab was then sliced up masterfully to give us juicy chunks of its legs. The rest of it was served in a shell, broiled to perfection and dressed to impressed: a thick layer of uni atop a bed of crab meat, embellished by seasonal golden ikura (the tone of the roe is more amber in colour and it provided more bite and crunch compared to regular ikura).The chef also gifted us with one-month-old anago over a light clear sauce (I imagine to be vinegar with a dash of sake) after the flavourful nigiri joined the extremely full ranks of our bellies. It was an odd treat, something neither of us had tried before and surprisingly good. The chewy texture of the baby eel was sublime against the light tang of the sauce though I felt a little guilty slurping up such a delicacy.The dinner was part of a birthday celebration that night for my partner, and the staff kindly arranged for a delightful platter for dessert. It comes complete with a small cake, sea-salt ice cream with wafers, mochi, some strawberries, and Japan's famous yubari melon.Dining at Ginza Sushiichi was a treat for all senses, the bright interior helped with the amazing presentation as well as the fun staff and chefs at work that night.Definitely recommended and will come back another time for another extremely enjoyable meal

We been there 27 January with my business partner , sushi bar is very classic Japanese small place .All sushi and sashimi cooking by chief in front of you. From fresh "just made" wasabi to 3 types of sushi with tuna . Tuna meat so tender that it melted in your mouth.Sushi perfect comes with cold or warm sake. Hope next time visit that sushi bar in Tokyo.Ikra was also good;)Origato

Amazing food. They had 3 menus to choose from so we went for the middle option. They had a selection of white fish, tuna and uni. So one needs to like the white fish. The rice was special because it was flavoured which is why every bite is unique. They still do the aburi in the old fashioned way with the charcoal which was delicious. For dessert, one adjoins to the Sake bar which is a more relaxing experience. Will be back.

Spent a wonderful lunch meeting at this amazing restaurant serving brilliantly awesome sushi and Japanese delights. The fish is flow in straight from Japan's Tsukiji fish market. Each sushi is delicately crafted by the chef in front of you. An accompaniment of Sake sits perfectly over the meal offering an experience to remember. Apart from the slightly steep pricing, this is a definite go to place for great Japanese cuisine

Ashino, shinji and Haatchi have been my gold standards for edo sushi in Singapore. I tried sushi ichi some 2 years back at scotts square and was sorely dissappointed. More solely owned by the Japanese founders, the place is worth another chance for your high end sushi dollar.The newest chef on the team, Ryo San prepared lunch for my wife, my (very expensive to feed) 9 yr old edo sushi loving son and I. What a feast we had. We just had the basic $100 ( did i say this was high end sushi?) lunch. Starting with a trio of seasonal small bites of marinated ayu belly, chilled tofu slices and persimmon with silken aged tofu, we then were treated to the dance of 7 (10 pieces actually)viels. Beautifully prepared and marinated sushi with the most perfectly cooked sushi rice. The rice was flavourful, just barely al dente and also just nicely subtle enough that the flavours of the fish were fully expressed. MAGIC!I will just let the pictures do the rest of the talking. Needless to say, i now have a new gold standard for the perfect sub $200 high end sushi lunch indulgence....

Went for the limited set lunch at the salon bar adjacent to the main restaurant. Call in advance for reservations. The service could be improved. There was only 1 staff, the bartender who had to serve all the guests, get the drinks, clear tables, fetch the orders etc. at some moments things took a long while and tea was not readily refreshed but that's not really his fault. Maybe 1 other staff to help him during lunch hour would be good. (I would have given 5 stars if not for the slower service) The food was outstanding. The fish very fresh. The portion was good. The rice was nicely warm. Everything was freshly prepared. Very lovely. The crab cream croquette was superb. Not oily and fresh creamy taste. Even I didn't like pickles but finished it all. It was yummy. Not too sharp in taste. I enjoyed the dessert of matcha cream and soya pudding. It was refreshing and good textures in the ingredients. On the whole a great experience. I'll be back again soon with my family!
