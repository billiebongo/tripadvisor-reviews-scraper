Everything here is spicy hot. I mean literally and metaphorically. The kebabs are to die for and the mock tail alongside makes your taste buds take you to a fantasy ride. Must visit for its interesting and captivating menu.

Really like a lot of the other Esplanade restaurants this place survives on location more than the quality of the food. Run of the mill Indian fare and pricey. Will miss this in the future.

This huge, peaceful restaurant came as a pleasant surprise to me. The food was so delicious (it was almost like having it in India) and the quantity was so satisfying. Great ambience, great food. No reason to miss this one.

Mirchi serves some great Indian food which will definitely satisfy your cravings. The food is spicy and also tasty. They have a good wine list and the service is very good. If you are around to watch a play or catch a show then you can visit this restauran

Went there for new year eve dinner and they had buffet priced at 40++.Food was delicious and service very good. Hot naans and Laccha parathas were delivered to our table. The veg appetizer "Hara bhara Kebab" was the best we ever tasted not oily and rightly spiced.Chicken Kebab was too spicy though. For main course they had Mutton rogan Josh, butter chicken and Goan fish curry which was fresh and delicious.Surprisingly their Peas Saffron Pulao was very delicious and so were sweets (Rasmalai). We had a very satisfying meal service was prompt and waiters very polite.We went there 10 years back for new year eve dinner and quality wise its still the same

For a mall inside an arts theatre there are no fine dining restaurants which is a real shame. Mirchi comes closest with excellent Indian meals and a good wine list. They also have some very attentive waiters and if you're going to the theatre or to see a show here this place is the best you're going to get for food and wine nearby
