I found Carnivori completely by mistake while searching for another restaurant. But what a pleasant surprise. I ordered the "The Philly" cheese steak and it was the real deal. Tender, juicy steak cooked to perfection along with all the usual steak and cheese add ones; grilled onions, grilled peppers and cheese. This is real western food that will fill you up and have you coming back for more. I'm American and this is the quality you don't usually get even in the United States. None of that frozen wafer steak that is so common there. The prices are fair by Singaporean standards so eating at Carnivori won't break your budget. This is a carry out restaurant, but there is a small table outside if you care to eat it there. Everyone working there was very friendly and talkative so the 10 minute wait was easy. Carnivori is a very small restaurant, but apparently does a lot of take away deliveries that caters to the locals. So that's a good sign as far as taste and quality goes. The kitchen is spotless and cleanliness seems to be a top concern. If you are ever visiting Singapore and find yourself in the Joo Chiat area you should stop in and give it a try. I don't think you will regret it
