I appreciate the healthy, tasty, affordable bento options. Way to innovate. Have eaten at both the Star Vista and OneKM mall (Paya Lebar) locations. Glad to see both have become quite popular, reflecting wider support for tasty vegetarian food.

Stopped in Green Dot for a late lunch. The restaurant is modern, clean and the service was fine.Had the mushroom Rendang as the main part of the bento box which was really tasty. Well flavoured with a slight background heat.The sides and rice were also good.It’s a big chain so it’s never going to blow your mind but for the price and a quick lunch it’s very good. And you don’t miss the meat

It was similar to fusion food. You can get rendang, Prawn,etc., here but vegan style. The food were made using mushrooms, gelatin, etc. you can have like a bento set or noodles. Ok for those who do not want the usual boring vegan way of cookin

Visited the green dot outlet at Paya lebar square. Restaurant is food court style, order your food, pay and food will be delivered to your table. Quick and efficient service. The shitake dry noodle is tasty with a bowl of clear vegetables broth. The mushroom burger is nice. Don’t quite like the packet chilli sauce Mc D style though. Good value for money. Love the osmanthus jelly drink!

I generally don't like vegan food. Was recommended by my friend to try the bento. You can choose from several dishes. The recommended was the rendang, which tasted delicious. I had another 2 dishes, the usual vegetables and another is using kinnokuya prawn, which was average.

If you are Vegetarian and touring Singapore, do not waste your time trying to find vegetarian or Indian food. Mock meats , made of soya are famous and I loved the set meal system at Green Dot, located in a mall, but very close to a metro station, the food was well balanced in taste and the colors looked great on the pallet. Tofu is a must try

So glad to have found this restaurant (mainly use the one in Jurong East, but quite a few others). The food is varied enough and fresh and everything we have tried has been delicious. All vegetarian and all MSG free. Not a huge variety but it is good and you know what you are getting is good quality. The speciality teas are pricy although the main dishes are very reasonably priced. A must go for veggies in Singapore

I've always been looking for healthy options for lunch and dinner but at times healthy food is overly priced. Was really glad when I discover Green Dot. The bento with choices of delicious dishes, brown rice with a soup is really affordable here! It's my staple dinner and I love it! They also offer noodles too! Will be back again

For 10$ we were able to get 1 big Vegan Laksa with some sort of delicious japanese vegan shrimp and nice noodles. Also some iced tea. We had the food at the shop, where tables are spaced enough to have a good conversation. They use stools not chairs, so is not super comfy for staying more than 45min. In any way, afterwards you can go downstairs and get Ice Cream or Chinese dessert.I went with a Vegan friend, and this is her go-to option in the area (and ordering online). Recommended

Vegetarians will love this place. Everything you see is Veg - including the prawn looking thing in your laksa!! Great Place for meals under $10/pax. Pros:Go for the Bento if feeling very hungry - The portions are decent and will leave your hunger satisfied. Usually the Lion Mane Mushroom rendang is Popular and they have to keep making it as it keeps flying off the stove! The soup on the side is brilliant - simple but brilliant!! Later in desserts, try the Mango with Panna Cotta (small version $6.90 is good for 2 pax frankly). Sit Outside by the flowing water, in evenings. Cons: The smoothies aren't that great - mainly crushed Ice I feel! Last Order 9.30pm. Place closes at 10pm.  Total Damages to budget: Bentos for 2pax - $16. Desserts for 2 pax - another $16
