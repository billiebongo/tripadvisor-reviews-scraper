Very nice place. Good service, food and drinks. The shrimps where a bit overdone, but everything else was good.The butterbeer is a must try.

Been there a number of times. Excellent service, reasonable price and food we ordered are extremely delicious. The portions are generous and simply love the taste. And not forgetting their speciality; butter beer, which is a must to try.

The first time we went there, it was so crowded that we gave up waiting. So finally had a chance to go there and decided we had to queue no matter what True enough, there was a queue and had to wait for about 20-25 minutes. The crew were friendly and accommodating. We were ushered to our table and waiter recommended us their best sellers. The menu was elaborate and choices were aplenty. I decided to go for the penang kway teow and wifey chose her bulgogi mee. We had to try the butterbeer and ondeh2 cake.Waiting time for the food was a breeze. The food came fast and efficient. The crew were really patient with our request and apologetic when we had our order mistakenly sent. Penang kway teow was superb, super spicy and really a huge portion for 2! You should only order this if you're really a spicy and kway teow fan. The crayfish made it all complete. True to reviews, the butterbeer was heavenly and cake simply magnificent.We really enjoyed our time and experience there.The only setback I have is the price, which is understandable due to the restaurant's prime location and top notch cuisines. Will definitely come again

It's value for money definitely. Taste is really good and not over priced. Ambiance is great for couple and friends gathering.But advisable to go early or you will have to queue. Service is average. Only disappointment is the Tea bags they used, can be improved. Definitely worth trying

The food/menu quite unique and delicious. The chicken lemak cilli padi pasta was quite fun and tasty. As they do not accept advance reservation, we had to queue for almost more than 30 minutes. The serving was quite slow too as they are abit short handed. Hope they could improve the speed as we like their food. Price slightly above average though
5
It was 6.45pm and already it's a full house. I had to queue for like 10min or so and I am the 4th in line. Lucky we came in a group of 6 so waiting time was a breeze. Ordered food items like the samosa, curly fries, laksa, rib and others. Food was lovely and service was IMPECCABLE. They were so attentive to us and also to all tables. Excellent job all!!

Our friend introduce us to this restaurant located in Esplanade, we went in a group of 8 and there are plenty of seating. The aircon from the diffuser is a bit cold though, the menu served a wide varieties of fusion food between western, malay and chinese. The food serving is a bit slow though but the food came in large portion. I have ordered the chicken satay pasta and my girlfriend ordered the clayfish curry noodle. The clay fish and the chicken is a bit hard, satay pasta is a bit spicy. The cheese fries are good but the price slightly on the higher side

ordered the tori hanjuku ramen ($14.90), butterbeer ($10.90), sizzle noode ($22.90 gosh), ondeh ondeh cake ($10.90). only the cake was really good and worth its price. the food was mediocre. it is also a turn off when restaurants charge for a normal cup of water ($1 somemore) without service service staff informing. dont queue for it

Came here for a birthday dinner with my friends. It has a nice cosy ambience and attentive staffs. We were spoilt with a salivating menu. Tough choice. I chose Kelantan Laksam, heard that it is yummy. True enough, didnt disappoint me. My friends chose Sg Laksa, Mee Ayam & Sizzling Noodles. We shared Duck Satay Rojak. The rojak comes with bits of lontong. Quite a big portion for an appetiser.I must say the price paid is worth for the generous food portion. However, the cakes are pricey. We didnt try the butter beer and yet to try the more noodles
3
The restaurant served generous portion sizes. Taste-wise, the food was just ok, not something to rave about. Whimsical plating but not a place you would want to go to on your first date because food is messy to eat. The butter beer drink was not served right -- it started to overflow as soon as we tried to drink it -- and was later replaced when this was highlighted to the server. A restaurant to consider if you are in need of a salt-rush.Servers could be more friendly and smile a little more. When we asked for recommendations, server wasn't terribly helpful

Serving reasonably priced fusion noodle dishes with efficient staff, this new Halal restaurant offers another option for pre-concert dining. It tends to get crowded during meal times so be prepared to join the queue outside if you are walking in.

Can recommend to all!
Food is absolutely stunning, refreshingly full of locals only.
(Maybe because of absence of alcohol).
But who needs alcohol to enjoy a good night out - especially as a family!
We'll be back for more! ❤️

Service need a little improvement. Most food we ordered are tad too sweet. Its like baiting the customer palate with sugar. Portion is big. Good for sharing. Ondeh Ondeh cake is moist and taste good. Bottomline - worth a visit but not sure about the second time

#halal #halalfood #halalsgWe were tempted by the recent hype on the halal (non-alcoholic) butter beer.lets just say I've tried another competition, Noosh's foam is better but I personally preferred the other's drink. but nevertheless it is nice and since the other one is not so readily available, they got the upper hand here.YEAY!! their Ribs by the bay S$35.90 I love the satay sauce idea, really goes well thou, their ribs seems a little smaller than expected. The meat was tender off the bone and they were very generous with their sauce.WIN!! As always their Onde-onde cake (loveeee), together with the butter beer or the tarik.Nicee- Chicken Siracha with cheese, the last time this came a tad too late I was already full and wasn't able to really enjoyed it. This is very niceee and cheezy. I love it thou the cheese do set to harden quite quickly best enjoyed when eaten immediately when the cheese are still hot and ozzing.NOOO - Ordered calamari rings, and we were disgusted when what arrived was somewhat of a seafood nugget ring. Never am I ever, ordering that again!calamari should be real calamari anything else is a crimeMeh - Noosh style ddeokbokki, can't quite put my finger on it. The taste is just not right thou one of my companions who never tasted any before seems to really loving it, until I introduce him to another place that sells halal authentic Korean dishes. He loves them both still and admits the later better.Staff were great, improved a lot than our previous visit. Although it was a full-house with super long que (time check 9pm) still long que waiting outside. They were attentive, systematic, fast, polite and always spotted with smiling faces. Music however was a little too loud for comfort. People were almost shouting to be heard when is just seated across tables (almost comical), and someone brought in those karaoke microphone (luckily they changed their mind)? That was weird and a little awkward considering the price we paid we expect a little splash of class not another "banafe'' -karaoke, I mean if they want to maybe a live band but the place is a little too cramp for that, especially on a busy weekend.not much photo this round, maybe next time.overall this place is still good, there is still dishes I've yet to try. So yes till my next update :

What's all the rave about?! Seriously.Though this is not a Michelin starred restaurant, I think anyone would expect some sort of standard when eating out to a highly raved about restaurant. Unfortunately, the standards on the quality of food served are beyond words! Now, where shall I begin...My friends and I decided to try it for ourselves over lunch. We were greeted and seated within minutes of arrival. Which was nice. Ambience was great though the bar could have been less wider so the restaurant wouldn't be so cramped to walk through. Very interesting fusion menu that we couldn't resist trying. So we ordered the following to share...1) Calamari rings2) Chicken siracha with cheese3) Duck satay salad4) Tori hanjuku ramen5) Sze chuan beef ribs noodle6) Smoked duck lemak chili padi pasta7) Vietnamese beef pho8) Butter beerAnd what's my/our take on the dishes? H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E seriously horrible! Why?1. Calamari rings were frozen and taste more like cuttlefish balls. Probably got it from the supermarket for about S$5 to S$8 then deep fry them and plate about 6 to 8 pieces over some salad in a cute little bowl then sell it to customer for S$10. Splendid.2. Chicken siracha with cheese were frozen too. Melted mozzarella cheese tasted cheap. 3. Duck satay salad was more like the Indonesian dish "Gado Gado". The smoked duck tasted like those that you could easily get from the Sheng Shiong supermarket in the frozen section. Simply reheat, slice and serve over some salad and rice cakes then drizzle over the sweet peanut sauce. The only thing nice about this dish is the prawn cracker that goes with it. That's it. Brilliant.4. Tori hanjuku ramen tasted nothing like ramen. More like noodles soaked in sweet instant miso paste soup loaded with more MSG. The only tasty about it was the chicken and egg.5. Sze chuan beef ribs noodle, again it's SWEET. I hope the chef gets his/her health check for diabetes. Lots of tender meat and pretty much that's it. 6. Smoked duck chili padi pasta, don't let me start again about the duck. Rather than serving perfectly al dente pasta, it was mushy, REALLY MUSHY. Then it's covered up by lots of greens. More like a bed of them. 7. Vietnamese beef pho tasted nothing close to tasty but sweet and loaded with MSG. Noodle wasn't cooked to perfection, still a little too tough. 8. Butter beer, thought one can never go wrong with it but it turned us down. Or maybe they were out of the butter foam hence the slack back. And it tasted more like a root beer with whipped cream top. Will I recommend this restaurant to my family and friends? NEVER and so does my friends. Paid 4 star price for 0.5 star quality of food. Wonder if those positive and highly raved about reviews are genuine. The owner should stick with her Ambeng Cafe where dishes are deliciously prepared from scratch and are fresh. Oh well, I hope I will never EVER get to write such a bad review of a restaurant.

I have been to Noosh quite a number of times and always recommended my family and friends to try out as their food are really good. But I was very disappointed when I went again this month (Sep 2017) and I will probably not go again. I am a fan of their beef szechuan noodles but they changed the beef and noodle. For the same price of $19.90 (no change) despite the fact that they replaced the type of beef used for the dish. The beef was overcooked, hard and does not taste good. I feedback to the waitress as I have tasted this dish quite a number of times. Noosh could probably improve on their service recovery when dishes served turns out bad. The waitress simply came back and told me she has already informed the chef and nothing was done. I was a returning customer who didn't mind paying the steep price for a good dish. Restaurants should keep up and maintain the quality of their food. But, as usual, when it becomes popular, no emphasis is placed on the quality and taste of the dishes (which is the most important)

Went down for a second time (for the butter beer)! Love the fusion menu served in this restaurant! Great variety. Tried their jjajangmyeon. Very pricey and really little portion. Very disappointed with my order as it just tastes like Mee Hongkong that I can get for like 5 bucks. Tried some other dishes and it turns out well (thankgod). Sambal chicken cutlet is really good- nice fusion of western and east. Szechuan Beef Ribs Noodle is really nice - very tender ribs and good portions. Butter beer ($10) is not bad - tastes like root beer topped with whipped cream.Restaurant is really crowded around 630pm onwards therefore a short wait outside the restaurant before getting our seats. No reservations can be done so make sure to come early to avoid the crowd

Queue was long. But I am fine with that if its worth the waiting. Price wise, I do not wish to comment due to its location at Esplanade. Butter Beer is tasty and fun to drink. As for the ondeh2 cake, curly fries and cheesey macaroni that I have ordered, its just not bad, nothing to shout out about. I definitely have tasted better ones.Service was good, staff was polite and pleasant. However, staff is lack of product knowledge, which personally I feel is a small matter as product knowledge can be trained

We had dinner here because it was halal and had been having a good rating. Well, it was indeed very good. We ordered chicken steak (see picture), kwetiau, crayfish curry, beef ramyeon, ddeokbeokki and butter beers. We all liked the foods, but the size was rather big. Another drawback was the queuing time. We had to wait outside the restaurant and standing for almost two hours! I think the management of the restaurant needs to find a way to reduce the queuing time to less than one hour. Good luck

We came here for dinner on the eve of National Day (public holiday). The service and the ambiance was pleasant. Food price was reasonable with good for sharing portion.

This place is perfect for celebration or a special treat.

Beautiful tasty food, not cheap but massive portions. Try the ramen noodles, probably the nicest I have ever had. My friends shared the duck lemak and also commented on the generous portions and great flavour. Recommended.

Visited this restaurant as one of my Muslim friends had always wanted to try their food. We ordered main courses and Teokbokki for sharing - I had the chicken with sambal (can't remember the dish's name) and the portion was pretty big. It tasted just average, nothing to rave about. I was actually expecting better for a restaurant standard considering the price I'm paying, but then again maybe it's just my personal taste.Wouldn't recommend the Teokbokki as it tasted really sweet and nothing close compared to its original spicy taste. We only had a bite each and gave up the entire dish. Ordered their desserts as well - the gula melaka cake and durian creme brulee which were both way too sweet. I really don't recommend their desserts even if you have a sweet tooth. Make a reservation before coming down especially during dinner time - the waiting time can be quite long if there's a queue outside

The ambience is great and the serving is really huge which is good, When the order is viewed, choices pop up and selection makes easier. The food tastes good. But when we face the bill and think through, it is the same kind of food we can get in hawker centre for almost half or lesser than that compared to the final bill. The menu choices are not unique or outstanding flavour it delivers. The food is good; tastes good and looks good. But not fantastic. It misses the X factor that the location and ambience and price requires. Perfect place to bring for date and impress the loved one but not really for a family out. Overall i am 50 50. PS: The service is really good and they are respectful

I was invited to a special restaurant by a friend last week, Noosh lots of great things on the menu , I went for fish and chips Asian style, hot n spiced up tasted great with the salad, not to mention the starter of onion rings and spring rolls, a great choice and a wicked dessert. thanks to my friend, and the nice waitress for smiling sometimes..

A new place, 4 months old, recommended by a friend for the smoked duck Lemak cili padi pasta (which he said was both tasty and really spicy making him sweat -- it was both). Also had the rojak with chicken that had a tasty cooling plum sauce. Lovely service: we sat outside because there was a line to get inside. We hope they survive and don't get overwhelmed by the early success and demand

We were so hungry when we got to this restaurant... We ordered before sitting down. We then sat and waited for about ten minutes before we waved to the person that we ordered from. She asked what we wanted to eat!We ordered starter soup for 7.90 sgd (!) And when we got it, it was so hot/spicy, that we could not eat it. And we like spicy food.We ordered a noodle dish instead because that was the only thing they could get vegetarian. 12.90 sgd. Plus tax!We demanded that the soup was taken off our bill. Which they agreed to. But that totally ruined the experience

We were so excited as been told this place was great and food looked amazing on everyone's tables, food was well presented and staff very welcoming. Then food arrived my duck was well and truly overcooked and my daughters prawns smelt off, we paid for our meal but could not eat it. When giving polite feedback they could have cared less. The only bad thing to happen on our whole trip

So glad there's a Halal eatery now at Esplanade so we've got an option to eat here before catching a show! And the best part is they serve a fusion of different types of cuisine! There's Malay, Indian, Chinese, Indonesian, Korean, Western, Italian... All served with a twist! There's so much variety that it was so hard to choose what to eat! The 4 of us eventually decided to order 2 mains (duck lemak chili padi pasta and beef ribs ramen) and 2 sides (curly fries with cheese & beef bacon and chicken siracha) to share and, boy, were we glad we did coz the portions are huge!! We were so full that we had to cancel our order for dessert! Everything we tried was delicious! The nice ambience and good service made the experience even better! Will definitely be returning to try the other dishes on the menu

We were greeted by a friendly staff at the door and it's really gives a good vibes from the beginning.We ordered Duck salad for starter, three other main dishes and ondeh cake for our dessert.Food came fast and staff are friendly and attentive.Duck salad is highly recommended. It's super delicious.Recommended to some friends and they've agreed with it
