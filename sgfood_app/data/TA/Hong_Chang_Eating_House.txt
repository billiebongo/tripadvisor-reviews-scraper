This is always my go to place for frog leg porridge in Singapore. Recommend the sambal chilli clams as well. Stingray is skippable.

This is a nice place for frog porridge. For those who do not like frogs, you can have the bbq fish. The porridge is sold in 3 different sizes claypot. Based on the crowds, on the reasonable prices, this is highly recommended

My family and I will go to this restaurant once every couple of months to eat frog leg porridge and stingray.The frogs are fresh and meaty, while the stingrays are also quite value for money.Tip: Try to go early (before 6pm) because there is limited seating and the place gets very crowded after 7pm
