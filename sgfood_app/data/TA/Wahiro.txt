We were a party of 7, all with different food restrictions. Thanks to the huge choice in menu we all had a fabulous meal. Great sake as well.

It was a last minute decision to come to Wahiro and boy, we were glad we chose to dine at this place!
Service was attentive and Food was excellent albeit prices were a tad on the high side...

Wahiro in Roxy Square offer simple Japanese food with reasonable pricing. Small eatery and cram but worth waiting

A great place for a good, family-style casual meal, no airs about them. Attentive and cheerful service.RESERVATION: strongly recommended especially on weekends. Over the years we've seen optimistic people turning up only to be sadly turned away. This joint has passed the test of time and for good reason

The missus and I went for a mid week meal and we're both pleasantly surprised to find this decent Japanese in the center of the village. We ordered some sashimi while we decided what else to eat. There was a nice looking set meal, and well priced at $68 p/p, but we weren't that hungry for 8 courses.Sashimi was good, not that frozen watery hell they serve up with conveyor belts.We had a bit of room to share a mackerel sushi plate - not bad - and a small tempura plate, which was really good, piping hot with a thin batter, and not at all oily.Worth a visit, a good Japanese for anyone local to Joo Chiat.

Visited this place after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. Pl book your table in advance as it's a small place with 8-10 tables plus sushi counters. The ambience is very very Japanese. Having visited many Japanese sushi places in Japan, I felt so very being in Japan when I entered the place. This was my opportunity to give good Japanese food experience to my family. And we all loved it. The sashimi was quiet fresh. Tempura was spot on. We also loved the grilled pork belly with rice cake. Miso soup was also very tasty. The service was quick and efficient. Only 3-5 service staff managing the whole place. But they managed it well. The whole place was full all the time. Next time I wish to bring my Japanese friends to try food here. All in all of you want to have good Japanese, this is the place to visit.

This restaurant serve very good Japanese food at very reasonable price. For example a set lunch range from $15 to $45. There are several $15 set which may include sashimi, yakitori, salad, miso soup and rice. If you don't take sashimi, there's another set with tempura, etc. It is really value for money. For the ala carte, the fresh sashimi fish are flown in from Japan 2 -3 times a week. So the best days to go with a lot of fresh fishes are on Tuesdays and Fridays. Prices on the ala carte are also reasonably priced. Every time I always feel so satisfy after a meal at Wahiro. Reservation is definitely required as it was packed

This is our family's regular hangout, and the only reason we'll go to Roxy Square. It's comfort food for us! The restaurant is visible from the street and best to make a reservation beforehand. The wagyu beef rice is a must if you enjoy beef. My family loves the sashimi platter and it's consistently good! We also enjoy the black and white miso eggplant and the cabbage roll. Service is friendly and attentive.

Wahiro is a nice Japanese establishment. The prices are not cheap but it is value for money. Whether you are eating sushi or yakitori , I love their sets and they have their regular set of customers. If you live in the East, do make an appointment with them to avoid disappointment especially during dinner time. I always go there for comfort food.

My local Japanese - Extensive menu with good staff. If your party is 2-4 sit at the counter where the action is. Some serious regulars, including myself, so that's always a good sign ;) Always call ahead to secure a good spot! Recommend the hot pots! Chef will take any customized sushi requests as well

We ate here because of a friends recommendation. The sushi was good but not outstanding, and the prices were somewhat sign. We sat at the sushi bar, a reservation was necessary.

This is not a "fancy" Japanese restaurant, but it IS a good, solid Japanese place that feels like a well kept secret.We have been there several times, and although we have always been able to get a seat, it's quite busy which gives the place a nice buzz and people always seems to be enjoying themselves. The decor and furniture is pretty basic although comfortable, so if you're looking for something glamorous, this is not the place. You can choose between seats at the bar where you can watch the chef at work, regular tables and chairs or if you want the real Japanese experience, you can opt for the tatami mats on the floor. Food-wise, this place speaks for itself. The sashimi is fresh, the chef is happy to customise and recommend whatever is freshest. The kushiyaki selection is fantastic - particularly the pork belly - and everything is well seasoned and has that delicious grilled flavour.Decent selection of sake and Japanese beers, and everything is served ice ice cold.If you want an un-pretentious, hidden-gem kinda vibe, and seriously yummy Japanese food then this is your place!Price wise, it's quite good value considering how many restaurants in Singapore serve s**t food at exorbitant prices... A feast for 2, with alcohol, set us back about $150 all in

Nowadays it is not easy to find a decent Japanese lunch set for S$15 but Wahiro stands out to offer a few of such choices in sushi, sashimi, tempura and Kushiyaki. None is of premium quality but my kids loved the chicken wing. I have never seen them lick the bones so clean like two hungry vultures ..

My home is about 3 mins walking to this restaurant. It's lucky to have such nice Japanese food near me! I normally go there for dinners, this little cozy place could be fully booked sometimes. If big group must reserve table. I think the quality and price is good, cannot say it's fantastic, but it's good value for Its quality, much better than most of places in Singapore! The only thing is the bathroom is outside, it's the old shopping mall bathroom, you can imagine...

Phoned to make a reservation for four people last weekend on a Sunday at 12.00 hours. The receptionist said I proceed with the booking but wanted to explain the new booking procedure for weekend. Basically when you book at 12.00 hours you have to leave the restaurant at 13.00 hours. I never finish Sunday lunch in less than one hour.I asked the receptionist if this new policy was to reduce customer numbers, as she certainly lost my patronage. My old adage, if the service is not up to your standard then do do go back

We've had lunch here so many times often in a rush and it's always fantastic. The food is always well presented and fresh with perfect portion sizes. The set lunch menu is great value for money and differs enough to make it always worth ordering. A consistant service delivery that makes Wahiro a place to keep coming back to

Situated quietly behind Roxy Square. Small, cosy & simple Japanese restaurant serving quality, genuine Japanese food. Reservation recommended! Ordered (can't remember the exact name): 1) Sashimi Platter for 2-3 pax2) Wagyu Beef Rice 3) Cold Udon with raw egg 4) Bacon wrapped Omelette Stick5) Beef wrapped mushroom Stick6) Beef wrapped Asparagus StickThey were all soooo good, I'll definitely be visiting them again. Though they aren't cheap but reasonably priced and well-worth for the quality of food :) I heard they do have good deals for Lunch!

Our son,who lives in Singapore, brought my wife and me here for lunch. The lunchtime specials were exceptionally good value for money - 15 SGD for three courses ! There seemed to be lots of Japanese eating in the restaurant, which, I feel, bears testimony to the authenticity of the food. Definitely well worth a visit

Ever since the Tamon restaurant closed I have been hunting for a good Japanese restaurant that has the same standards. The Wahiro meets all the requirements on all fronts.Our first visit was on the week end lunch time and we were lucky to get seats, even though we arrived just after noon.That is a good sign, but you wish to book a table, to make sure you get a seat.The standard of the food is excellent. We had sashimi,yakitori sticks, and miso soup with hot saku.Our second visit was on week day, we arrive early so no problem getting a table. However the the restaurant fills up to capasity, in no time.The set lunch is the way to go, amazing value. Just add on from the a la carte menu, what ever you wish for. The proof of a good restaurant in Singapore is that you keep going back. I have found the perfect Japanese restaurant, and will taking family and friends to enjoy the experience.Budget between S$ 40;00 and S$ 50:00 a person. Good value for mpne

I've been here countless times over the last 10 years. Prices are above average but you get quality which will cost more if you eat in the city centre. Choose the counter seats for a more authentic Japanese experience; the tables are too narrow and close to one another. There's a helpful English menu with some pictures. Lots of choices and everything has a certain standard. I like the mixed sushi and sashimi dishes, the tuna belly maki, Californian maki wrap, steamed fish head, grilled items and awesome Naniwa soba. Sake is expensive though. The $38++ dinner set is good value.

Food is above average, service is average. Price of food is on the high side. Sake prices here are also on the high side. Reservation in advance is required.

Located in an old shopping centre in a old neighborhood. But provides a really good value lunch sets all week long, even on weekends. The item that u must not miss is the goose liver sushi üç£!!! It's melt in your mouth yummy!!!

had the $15 ++ sashimi set. very small portion of sashimi although fresh, nothing special. came with less than average tempura and oden. all in all, it was worth the money but nothing special.

Really, really enjoyed a family dinner. The food was excellent and the staff were attentive and helpful - we continued to order more and more food; it was that good. I thought pricing was reasonable. The restaurant is tucked away in an old shopping centre but don't let that stop you from trying this excellent Japanese restaurant

Has a great selection of sashimi, sushi and yakitori.My kids love it here as the food has a high quality level. They have very affordable set lunches at $15-$25, though the top quality range can set you back $80-$100 per person if you order ala carte. If you are willing to splurge, the quality is top-end.I also love their yakitori, especially the buta mochi. Yums

This little place is one of the best kept secrets in Singapore. A 'moms and pops' style Japanese restaurant that reminds me so much of our visits to Tokyo and Sapporo. The scale is 'just right' and the menu covers all the basics without pushing too far. I would recommend the sushi and sashimi because the chefs really care about what they are doing. I know this is true in many sushi restaurants but here they are painstaking with presentation and almost fanatical about quality.A lovely little 'indulgence' is the fois gras sushi - always made to order and it just melts in the mouth. The restaurant does a humble but tasty tempura menu and some quality seasonal items and yakitori. Basically, you can have pretty much what you fancy.The staff are all wonderful. The guys at the sushi counter will make personal recommendations and they are not out to rip you off. Quite the opposite, they are just keen to promote their latest item. The waiting staff are also very pleasant. They tolerate my dumb questions and make recommendations about quantity and range. Overall, this is a place I would thoroughly advise you to visit. It is relaxed and welcoming. A real Katong Gem

Came with my wife. The prices are quite high for small portions. They added 10% service charge automatically. The food was very good, however. The atmosphere was great. There was a section where you remove your shoes and sit at the table, which is fun for those not accustomed to it. If the portions were larger I'd have rated it better.

It was my first visit , the ladies staff werent attentive. I was quite happy with my unadon (eel rice) yet i found hair in the rice. I shown it to their staff, i m disappointed on their respond - oh, so sorry. Not even offer to exchange or at least show their concern on the issue by asking back what can we they offer etc. So i stop eating n I paid. I m not keen on the extra or free but pls show your attitute to ur customer that you care to have us back! Jesusss...

We seldom eat out in Singapore as my husband prefers home cooked food. This is one of the very rare chance that he brought us out for a Jap lunch after recommendation from his CPE. For only $15-20/set lunch, it definitely worth the money. If u like to try some authentic Japanese food but is budget-type person, u must try this

We have been dining in Wahiro for almost 10 years and they have been consistently excellent. For a family of four we could have a sumptuous and authentic fresh Japanese seasonal ingredients for less than S$55 per head. My favorite is their 8-course Wahiro set, Kushiyaki (BBQ stick), and the sashimi (raw fish), which is very fresh and quality cut. There is also a wide selection of side dishes like homemade fish cake, beef tongue, soft chicken cartilage, tofu and the hiyamugi noodle (cooked in many sensational ways). If you are around the corner, you must give this little place a try - but do call and make a reservation first. For sake lover,,,you would be surprised to find more than 60 varieties in this tiny place
