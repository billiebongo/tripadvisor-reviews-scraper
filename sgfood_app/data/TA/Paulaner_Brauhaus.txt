Food was excellent. In my opinion much better than Brotzeit. The atmosphere on the second floor which is the restaurant is great for family gathering or a quiet dinner.

I you are looking for a large variety of German food in one single meal, this is the place to go.
Tastes like home.
Have never been disappointed here.
4
Excellent German beer and food. Portions were far too large but the Germans like their food!! We shared a schnitzel platter but even then it was too much.
5
Great service..food n beer needless to say and got a good table n enjoyed e time ..good all round! Will go again
5
Nice place here, good vibe, nice beers and a fabulous schnitzel platter! Couldnt eat it all and it was delicious. Also entertained by a live duo who were great. Platter plus four 500ml beers was about SG$100. Good value.

It's best to visit Paulaner on a Monday night when they have a 1:1 happy hour. Other days it's only 20% off for the happy hour, which still means you end up paying around $16 for a beer - not cheap. I had the dark beer which was decent. I would have had a second one if it had been the 1:1 deal. Next time I'll try and visit on a Monday night
4
My husband and I visited the paulaner brauhaus on a stopover. Coming from Europe and having been in Asia for a while, we craved for some European feel.The Paulaner brauhaus is spot on in interior, food is fine, beer is really good and brewed at the place. Service was good, and there was live music.All in all a fine experience, but the beer & food are quite pricey
5
If you are starving for German food and drinks, I can highly recommend the brunch on Sundays. It is all you can eat and drink (if you pay a surcharge) and you will enjoy it. The food is real good quality and the service great. They have a kids corner where the little ones can play. Remember to book a table since it can be busy.
5
We visited Millenia Walk Mall and their outside area called Park and Dine. At the end, we found Paulaner Brauhaus German Micro Brewery Bar. For us it was important that It was air-conditioned. Behind the bar one could see the equipment for brewing beer. Husband ordered Nurnberger sausage plate which came with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes (unfortunately instant). I ordered the pork schnitzel which came with French fries and lemon wedges. Supposedly the owner and chef are from Germany and the meal was excellent. The portions were quite large
1
One of the worst experiences of food in my entire 51 years of age! The pizza was absolutely disgusting: they forgot one pizza when serving, what they then gave us tasted like a lard base! My son had ribs, gross fatty ribs that tasted like they had been boiled.They did being my daughter brownie and ice cream for free for her birthday which was nice.Moral of the story: Singapore is multi cultural, whatever is on the menu should be cooked superbly. Nothing less is good enough.Not happy at all.
5
So tasty house brewed beer.
Tasted 2 types, both awesome.
Service was good.
Little pricy for the location.
4
Had a few ales here, during happy hour there is 20% off, I think happy hour was 5 until 8 pm. They do what I would call pub grub and what we had was fine. Would pop in again no problem.
5
Attentive, friendly and quick staff...
Yummy dishes in huge portions...
Freshly brewed tasty beers...
What is more to say?

Nothing really wrong with this place but nothing memorable or inspiring either. The platter we had was just dry roasted chicken, commercial sausages and mashed potatoes (they were out of dumplungs) with sauerkraut and red cabbage. Separately, we also ordered pork knuckles (which was also in the platter)- crackling wasn't there and it was also dry. Food was not cheap, neither was the beer. Wait staff, while polite, kept pushing us for more drinks. Not an entirely enjoyable evening.
1
We visited Paulaner on Saturday for dinner and opted for an outdoor seat. We had to get into the restaurant to get the attention of service staff to take our order.Prices were on the higher end so we expected better but everything was way below par:- Apfelschorle: $8.80. But for this price we got 1/3 ice cubes, 1/3 water and finally 1/3 Apple juice. - One pretzel with cheese and meatloaf: $11.90- schnitzel and fries: $18.90. Fries were lukewarm/cold when served.- 1/2 roasted chicken: $18.90. Requested for fries to be replaced with mash potato. They served it with fries and we had to wait for another 20minutes before they served it to us with the right order.It felt like the food was left outside for a while before getting picked up by service staff as we waited for 20-30 mins before it came to our table. The starter was served together with the main. And to sum up, the food wasn’t delicious either.I hope Paulaner would improve on their food and service standards before they start charging such exorbitant prices meant for higher quality experience.
3
Food is generally tasty though it tastier in the Paulaner Bräuhaus restaurants in Germany. Service was poor especially if you opt to sit outside of the restaurant overlooking Suntec City. Hard time getting order as the staff are not assigned by tables and they were no where in sight. Bottom line - just be prepared to hunt the staff inside the restaurant
5
At the Paulaner Brauhaus you will find some great German authentic food in Singapore. They also brew the Paulaner Beer here - that tats so great on a hot summer. The dishes are large and well prepared. The Currywurst is great - and one of the best I found in complete Asia. Over the past 3 years we visit it about 20 times and the the quality was every time on a high standard. Also the brunch buffet is great with a wide selection of German comfort food. Even if you don't want to eat you will find here a great and refreshing beer
4
Probably the best german beer served in Singapore. Goes well especially with the sausages and knuckles. One downside is the live band is too loud and nobody can hold a conversation when they sing. Sitting outside is not an option due to the humid condition, while the restaurant on the higher flr lacks the ambience for drinking.
1
Thumbs up for the food however the service is impersonal and non existent. Not sure how we were served lunch without any off the staff saying one word to us. After flagging the staff to order, the server took our order, nodded and walked away. Have not experienced this much rudeness in our four weeks in Singapore.
3
This place is not cheap, a burger with chips, a salad, a beer and a small cocktail cost nearly sgd$87 which is a lot of money. Food about average quality but this is open late when everything around is already closed. I went there for dinner after 11pm and "paid the price
4
They seem to brew locally. The beer tasted great. Service is nice but has some gaps! Quite expensive to get drunk here from beer. But that is quite common in Singapore.
5
Beer was really good! if you can come for their special promo on Sun and Mon, it is 50% off! Great deal!
5
The little restaurant serves fresh German beer, with some regular flavours and some seasonal favourites.
Food is german inspired pub food and quite good.
4
Although I love Asian food. After a couple of days my pallate craved something more familiar.
Paulaner hit the spot. Standard German dishes served in large portions with good in house beer. I visited on a 1/2 full Tuesday evening. May get busy on weekends.
3
Not much atmosphere. We ordered the pork knuckle, which is a gigantic portion - we could not finish it although we shared. Quality is only average. Prices are on the high side.
4
Three beers brewed on the premises - good for them! I had the blonde and the Weiss, both good! And a portion of calamari, also good. I paid $38, and as I was there in a Sunday, I did wonder whether the brunch with beer at $68 might have represented better value, although I may have ended up drinking rather too much beer. Singapore's sunshine seems rather out of place in a German brew house, and there isn't much in the way of an atmosphere, maybe it needed to be busier. And don't let the reviews fool you into thinking that this is a small place - it's huge and the rest rooms are on the third floor, quite a walk if you were to be in a hurry. Still, this place wins on beer, especially compared to the rather lame brews at Level 33 I sampled yesterday
3
Went to dine with some friends over beers. Good happy hour deals on Monday - 50% off the beers and they need to keep that all week as their prices are way too expensive for a microbrewery. Food-wise, it is mediocre. The description in the menu does not meet what is being served. Ordered sausages that is served with mustard, we had to ask for it. Ordered pizza that comes with bitter cress, it came with alfalfa sprouts. Ordered the dessert kaiserschmarrn half expecting that it'll be baked in the oven, it came in a texture that is similarly to a steamed cake. Overall, not impressed for the prices we had to pay. Service was also almost non-existent in the outdoors. They ask to hold the bill with a credit card and disappeared. However, when the staff did appear, he was pleasant and polite. The atmosphere is relatively nice, but I won't necessarily be back in a jiffy.
4
Restaurant was situated at a location that was difficult to find if you are not familiar with Millenia Walk. Took us quite awhile to find the place but it was worth it.We ordered the seasonal beer Maibrock which went very well with our mains of pork knuckle and sausages. The pork knuckle was one of the better ones that I had - crackling skin but yet not hard like some served in other German/Bravarian restaurants. Soup lovers will also love the creamy white asparagus soup.We had our table at level 2, which was good for conversations with friends. Level 1 was more like a pub, suitable for people who are there just for drinks and finger foods
3
Went during a late lunch break so there weren't a lot of people around. Service was OK. Of course, one doesn't expect exceptional Chili at a German Restaurant. So lets just say it was OK German Chili! Portion was certainly above average. Nice facility. I'll have a German dish when I'm back there next week
4
i like breweries with copper.Atmosphere if-s great with music band (only one f singer and one m singer/guitarist) with really nice voices which is unusual in Singapore.Food is not top but ok, this is german good :-) not french or italian.Tables are not very confortable but there are acceptable.The main problem for me they do not serve coffee after 5 pm and it makes me dizzy
4
Great place after work. Quick service of our drinks and attentive staffs who constantally check on your tables.
3
This place has good beer but food is not great and service tends to be quite average. Now many more bars have opened up around Suntec, there is more competition so perhaps you have some choice where to visit
4
The food is excellent and is generally been visited by expats, the food is based on german theme as well as the drinks, but awesome place to just sit, have a pint of beer and relax, enjoyed the food too.
4
Seemed pretty authentic, and the happy hour beer was good. We were tired and hungry, and this was just right. Next to the Pan Pacific Hotel as well, which was great. Service a bit slow, but the staff was very nice
5
Enjoyed a few beers and some shrimp and fries one evening. Many screens showing football, as well as a live duo singing very well. Will seek it out next time in Singapore.
5
Shops restaurant business can close or went bankrupt, but not this one! still standing after years and years, from my student era till I came with family, It's still there!!!! One place that I will and must to visit everytime went to S'pore!
4
Went twice whilst in Singapore, was good to sit outside in the warmth and drink a beer or two. Beers were 2 for the price of 1 which made it more attractive. Good spot I liked it and so did my friend as she could smoke at the outside tables.
4
Paulaner is a more typical style restaurant than others in Singapore. They not only offer more dishes, the location also looks more traditional (if you ever visit Vienna, have a look at "Brandauers SchlossbrÃ¤u" in Hietzing to find out the similarities).We enjoyed the weekend buffet with a huge variety of different food and typical deserts
2
Shop floor service ok. Beer fresh and good. Forget shopping bag worth 180 SGD below the table. Phone the restaurant 10 minutes after. Phoned 20 minutes after again. Despite promising nobody called back. Fortunately Singapore is a nearly thug free place. Needed to go back in heavy rain to retrieve the bag that was still sitting where we left it.
3
Came here for a quick beer before my flight. Got 2 for 1 beers which is great, and ordered a serve of calamari. Sadly there was nothing special about them, and the beers were fine but nothing memorable. Priced too high for what they serve here
4
We normally come here Sunday's and Monday's because it one for one on all draught beers. The beer is excellent and the food is typically German so if you want a taste of Germany it is pretty authentic here.
3
They have set meal during lunch at 15.90++ with free flow of soft drinks. I tried their breaded chicken. One thing good is you could change the fries to others like mashed potato, salad and so on.
4
A lot of gern an dishes, like Bratwurst, Münchner Weisswurst, Laugenstangerl, Apfelstrudel and many more
5
If you are crazy about German pork knuckles and sausages, you must try Paulaner Brauhaus' sunday brunch spread. They offer a wide range of items on this buffet, from soup and salads to meats and desserts. For a little bit more money, you can opts for their free flow of beers as well, while you dine. Worth every penny and absolutely delicious.
3
Went to the Paulaner Brauhaus for dinner, remembering positive experiences in other German Paulaner and Erdinger franchises around the world. Had a pork knuckle that was as offered pre-chopped and a soft drink. On the positive side:- Location gives you the feeling of a German beer house- Menu is comprehensive, majority of dishes are Germany-related but also some fusion dishes for Asian palate- The knuckle itself was a big portion- The pricing seems to be considerate (if the quality was on par)On the negative side:- Staff (students?) plentiful but lack training; brought three meat sauces after I had finished basically the meal; never asked about how it was; didn't remove plate/check for dessert etc. unless waved at and asked for- Pork knuckle was unfortunately tasteless; the so-called Knödel were two thin slices of a dried and difficult to identify nature looking like decoration and not the main side; the Sauerkraut was soggy; the actual meal presentation has little in common with their pictures on the net that show the use of fresh herbs and larger side dishesWould I go again? Maybe if I was a beer fan craving for German beer but not for the food itself
5
Was lucky enough to get there for their 20th anniversary celebrations. The beer is always freshly brewed and the knuckle is always large and crispy. Just watch out for when it gets really busy. I have seen them collect beer overruns into a separate glass and then use this to top up other beers later on. eww
4
went with a colleague on a wednesday - not too many people and easy to get a place to sit since the bar/restaurant is quite big.ground floor has a bar area with live music and the brewing equipment.1 st floor is a large beer hall in typical bavarian style.Beer is as expected, well chilled and tasty.Food choice is ample and taste is ok but nothing fancy.For non europeans surely an exiting food experience.In all it is a recommendable place if you want to have non asian food for a change and the beer is always with a visit. I found the small band playing very nice
5
Six week work trip to Singapore and this fab place is opposite my hotel. Fatal!Beer brewed on site: Munich Lager, Heffewei§er and a Dunkel plus loads of other excellent beverages.Superb menu and consistently excellent food in reassuringly large quantities. Crispy Pork Knuckle phwooooar! Currywurst and chips plus many other tasty delights.I'll be back
4
Had a great weezer's party at the convention center and we thought we could wash away the adrenaline still pumping from the concert with beer just across the road. But NO!!!! we thought wrong! More adrenaline pumped by not only the dark lager but the small live band seshing there. The band was electrifying though there's only 2 on stage. Guitar man with sexy voice was HOT!!! Great music and more party! Mondays will never be the same!! WEEEEEZZZZZZ!!!!!! NOTE TO SELF: RETURN TO THE BRAHAUS SOON!!!
4
I love the food in Singapore. Chicken Rice, Chili Crab...you could go on and on about the wonderful and exotic food the country has to offer. So I was a bit surprised when some friends suggested a German restaurant after the theater one night. Paulaner Bräuhaus is near the Esplanade and it is open late, so it is not a bad choice for after the theater.The menu is pretty extensive and of course, you can get German beer. I had bratwurst, which was served with sauerkraut, Bavarian style. They were tasty, but not like the ones I had in Munich. My dining companions had schnitzel, which they pronounced fine. It was not a bad meal, and I am sure as good a German meal as you will get in Singapore. But why
4
Nice place to have lunch. The pork knuckle was delicious and beers reasonably priced. Highly recommended if you're looking for a full and satisfying meal!
2
Tables sticky and the place smells like stale beer. Floors and bathroom filthy. The place really needs to be cleaned. Service almost non-existent. 3 wait staff on a slow Saturday afternoon- actively ignoring customers. Very poor.
3
Tried this brewhouse our first night in Singapore. Good beer and nice bar area. Wouldn't recommend eating here unless you really like German food [potatoes, sausages, etc]...much better options in the local area.
1
Well the beer is good and cold, but the place is grubby - sticky tables and flies all through the place. The food is a disgrace. Vegetables with the meal were barely unfrozen, the steak was tough and almost Un eatable, sausages had little flavor and the burger was just acceptable. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else if you want to eat. Staff don't care and show little interest.
5
Every time tO Singapore I always Come tO This Place , Which THE hefe weisse is One Of My fav and also THE Grilled Pork knuckle . Again This time With 5 Business friends wE visited here With Good consistent SERVICE , great Food and best Beer. THE Pork knuckle is oN THE table Along With THE garden salad and prawn salad , THE veal and sure ly THE hefe weisse Paulaner Which round UP Our dinner. Atmosphere like In Germany With bavarian ornament and ITS Micro Brewery . Wifi is Free , But wE cudn't Use IT Due tOo busy With Our Food and DRINKS . Highly recommended IF you are a Beer lover.

I've been to several Paulaner bars/restaurants across Asia and always found them OK - this one nails it completely. Its big, spread across two floors with a huge cavernous ceiling which does give you a munich beer hall feeling.. The staff are friendly and efficient too.I was there with a friend and we both ordered the draught beer (brewed on premise) - pretty good. We then ordered the pork knuckle... we decided to skip the side dishes and good decision too: the knuckle is huge, tasty, tender - just perfect. Its a real meat fest, and arguably two people could easily share. The knuckle was around 30 singapore dollars which I thought was pretty good value for Singapore. If you fancy a couple of beers and a very meaty German meal - this is definitely the place to go. Just don't each much before you go
4
I stopped here for a beer and a quick bite to eat. I ordered the pig knuckle and a beer. It was a bit pricey, but the knuckle was enough for 4 people to munch on. The beer was great and they have 1 litre beer glasses. Service was o.k. Normal for Singapore or most pubs meaning they take your order and bring your beer and food promptly. Don't expect any small talk or people asking about your day. The place was fairly busy and has been around many years. I good place to unwind
4
Had dinner here to celebrate a Birthday, went to the Millenia Walk branch. The bar is downstairs with live music, the 2nd floor is the restaurant. It's a gorgeous old building with a high ceiling and great decor! It doesn't get too noisy when the restaurant fills and when people get rowdy, which is great!We tried the darker brew house beer, which was pretty good but maybe a bit too filling for my liking. If you like something lighter, the lager would be a better option.We ordered the Pork Knuckle, Giant Snail Sausage and the Garden Salad, all were pretty amazing. The Pork Knuckle was huge! Authentic flavor, lots to eat for 3 people . The sausage was exceptional! Also shared the 'Apple strudel', did have to wait about 15min, but it was worth it! Great pastry with the apple and cinnamon, a vanilla ice cream, some cream with strawberries. Really great stuff!Also, if you have a Citibank card, you save 15% off the bill! (except the beer because we ordered at Happy Hour time, but that was already 20% off during Happy Hour)So all in all, $30+ per head, really great value! If you want some great German food, a nice location off Orchard Road. You'll like Paulaner @ Millenia Walk
3
Value - average over all. Had screens showing soccer matches so I will return if theres matches that I wanna catch.Food - We had snacks instead of food as we had dinner earlier. The sausages were like those mini ones instead of the normal ones.Beer is good as usual but seems a tad pricey. So unless theres some promotion, elsewhere seems a better bet.Service - seems a little too relaxed. Theres service charge added into the bill
2
German stube in Singapore. I didn't Expect much, but here the quality is really below the standard. The beer is over priced and the dishes are for most part iced. I suggest to avoid the bigger and most expansive dishes: we had a big slice of meat but the sauce was still iced and the meat not really good.If you want to go in this place, I suggest one beer and some small bites like bretzel etc: cheaper but tasty
3
Seems to have a dinner in Germany or Austria. Food is same. Beers also. Nice furniture and amenities. Quite professional waitresses. Little bit pricey.
4
Service can be a little relaxed but the food and beer served are solid to their German roots. TV's in the bar show Bundesliga matches as appropriate.
4
About the best BavarianStyle brew house you are going to find in Singapore! I have always like Paulaner beers and this drew me into the place. The food was good too, with the usual beer hall selections, prepared competently, and served properly.
5
This has become a regular spot for me on business travel or even when I am traveling with my family. Close to my regular hotels so very convenient. Paulaner beer is one of my favourites worldwide anyway and the food is pretty good.
3
Great spit for pub food and passable German bier garden fare. Mostly a wanna be spot. But fun for locals, travelers, and expats.
1
Came to Paulaner with the written confirmation of showing Bundesliga (VFB-FCB). Missed the first third of the game because Premierleague was on, and until this was over no Bundesliga was shown. Everywhere in Town (and this world) you can watch Premierleague but when a german Brauhaus starts preferring the english league over their Hometeam something is seriously wrong. I am very very dissapointed (especially by the attitude given to me from the Manager), so definitely never again! Watch it online or at home, don't waste your time and money to come here, they couldn't care less unfortunately.PS: Food and drinks are o
4
I loved being in Singapore and enjoying a thoroughly German experience! We stopped for a quick beer and a snack, and enjoyed the experience! I ordered sausage and a pretzel and both were very authentic, the pretzel tasted like it was made fresh! The goulash was exceptional with spätzle like egg noodles, and the beer cold and tasty.Upstairs is the wonderful main restaurant and I'd be amazed to find a person who didn't think that you had stepped into Bavaria, the decorations were incredible
2
I went with out of town guests who wanted some German food. We tried to call to book but no answer to our call. Upstairs restaurant atmosphere is quieter than lively downstairs bar. Food was just OK. We waited 15+ minutes for our desserts. Too many other great food choices in Singapore. I wouldn't bother unless you're really craving German- ish food
3
My first visit to the restaurant and with out of town guests. There was a table with three loud children next to us. They had been yelling and screaming, running around the room with grandma after them, bothering the wait staff and parents doing nothing to control them. The parents were done eating and were on their phones. Finally one of the fathers got up, but by then, we had enough and said something to them. They got upset at us for complaining!The point of this review is that management didn't or wouldn't do anything about it while the rest of the diners endured the noise and the running around. While the food was decent, I wouldn't go back to the second floor restaurant for the poor service received today
5
One does not miss any cuisine when in Singapore. Paulaner has not only authentic German interior to make you feel you are in Germany, but the German-owned restaurant imports German ingredients and a German Chef supervises authentic German food for the guests.The restaurant also has a terrific brunch on Sundays which is very popular. There is huge seating space at two levels.German beers and german food is best at Paulaner. Highly, highly recommended
2
Sometimes we should trust our gut feeling....but people kept saying this place was good. Sorry. Average food, high prices and completely disinterested service. Move on...nothing to see here.
4
Good environment for German Dinner. Pork Knuckle, German Sausages, Grilled Fish and house brew beer. Unlucky that I'm having gastric during the Christmas Dinner with family. If not, I will be able to finish the whole pork knuckle myself.
4
Relaxed, good cuts of ham, great beer and good sausages - whats not to like about Paulaner Bauhaus (if you're just a little bit into German bier-garten/keller culture)
3
Came here for lunch one day and waiters seem to be pre-occupied and bored. The food is ok. Not the worst or the best. Beer was pretty bad. I don't know if it was just a bad batch but it was stale.
3
Travelled 4,000 miles to quench my thirst at the Paulaner Bräuhaus Singapore and they didn't have Paulaner Pils! (quite possibly the best beer in the world).
The Oktoberfest beer was good, but overall this was a massive disappointment.
5
I went for the Sunday brunch which is a pretty good price for Singapore, especially if you intend on drinking a few beers. The food is buffet style, but authentically German; my German wife approves.The best part is that during Sunday brunch, they have a play space for kids, with child minders that actually engage with the kids and do crafts and games. My 6 and 8 year olds love it. They love it so much, that after eating, they leave the adults to enjoy conversation for a couple of hours
5
You pay a set price for a buffet with, or without alcohol; with, or without soft drinks. Kids go free. My wife, son and I went on a Sunday and had a lovely time. The staff were friendly, the food great and the atmosphere great. There is also a kids friendly area
2
Just stopped for a couple of beers , they got the order wrong , beer should have been colder , service obviously poor, getting an order of 2 beers wrong , the furniture was wonky, and then 34 dollars for two beers , on 500 ml and one 300 , seriously in a city like this there is far better out there , all around this in fact , seriously not good enoug
3
If you visit Paulaner make sure you follow up on the progress of your order. I went to Paulaner for lunch with a friend. We decided to share a pork knuckle and ordered with pretzel. The pretzel arrived quickly but 40 minutes after ordering the waiter came back to tell us there was only one 1/2 serve of pork knuckle left (one of the daily special items). We had to change our original order and took the remaining 1/2 serve pork knuckle and an order of Nürnberger which once again took time to arrive. The food was good but definitely NOT worth the time we waited. The staff need to improve on their poor attention to service in a bar/restaurant that only had a couple of diners
5
Went to Paulaner Bräuhaus during their Oktoberfest celebrations and had a whale of a time! The band that they flew in all the way from Munich Germany was fantastic. Food is absolutely, fantastically and authentically German and true to their Bavarian roots!Staff are friendly and attentive. Beer selection, oooohhhh brewed on site. Nothing better than to have a damn cold one! Beats going to some old crummy old pub! If u want to have a nice Sunday brunch with the family, it's available at Paulaner, fun for the whole family.... While daddy gets sloshed!! I'd recommend this place for anyone who missed Germany and for people who want to experience Germany at its best!
4
Great burgers, sausages and pork knuckle, and lager, not bad for saying how far from Germany it is, service is a little disjointed but the venue is handy with plenty of outdoor seating.
5
Had a wait between two planes at Changi.
Took the opportunity to go to the Paulaner and eat good German food and drink good beer.
Great as usual!
5
We had a sausage platter as well as their famous pork knuckle. I must say after all these years, the quality still maintains.
5
Nice place to relax and have a drink. Its one cafe of the Paulaner beerhouse group. Service is great, friendly staff. Sometimes a bit crowded but that only proofs its good. You can have something to eat also.
2
I used to patronise Paulaner Brauhaus in the past. Quite recently, I went back for a dinner. I was disappointed with the standards now. Ordered some main courses which was pale in standards (if I may compare it with another German franchise Brozeit, miles apart!). Dishes served were of no difference to those cooked in chow halls; very amateurish! Maybe the beers which I ordered that evening was a consolation
4
Paulaner Brauhaus is located in the Milenia Walk mall, not too far from Marina Bay (actually its behind the Ritz Carlton Hotel).Food was pretty good, especially the Pork Knuckle had a crispy skin and tender meat. But also the Sauerkraut and the Nuernberger Sausages were pretty authentic. I had the Lager beer which was excellent and fresh, my buddies say the Dark beer was great too. Service was good throughout the day shift, in the evening (when it got more crowded) it got harder to get the waiters attention and I walked up to the bar to place my order.Nevertheless, if you crave for German food and beer in Singapore, this place is a good choice
4
You get you typical german style beer like you would expect but it is brewed right on location. When you first walk in you smell the mash and all the good stuff beer is made of. And yes, the food is pretty good as well. The lower level bar is fun with the tanks behind the bar. Good outside seating if you can take the heat
5
If you like paulaner this is the place for you obviously. i only visited the bar but it was great to have a real muncher helles after a long hot day.The bar also got a band playing and they are not too loud. during weekdays the bar always a got a few seats so no waiting necessary.the beer is authentic and tastes just like in munich. i visited this place several times during my stay in Singapore(located right next to the hotel) The waitress Felicia, who worked the nights we visited, was very cute, nice and service minded. Overall it seems that the service was excellent at this place and no body had to wait long before having a new fresh beer or getting the bill.note that the bar is rather small and intimate so dont expect a big bier garden
2
Beer is good..the sausages and roast pork were so so. The service is poor. On a Wednesday night. Slow night.After 15 mins of sitting at table. Not bar... no wait staff came to take our order. Had to walk over to bar and order via bartender.Check came..overcharged for cancelled grilled chicken dinner. Took them 15 to 20 mins to sort it out...I had to go to bar to collect the corrected check. After signing the check. No apologies for mistake or the long wait...geez. sounds the incompetence is expected at this restaurant.
4
I liked the look of this place when walking by so I popped in. The 1ltr steins were very welcome on a hot day. The place is full of westerners and the food was a pretty good stab at typical Bavarian/German meals although was slightly lacking.This doesn't matter though as its all about the beer and this was the best part of this bar. Give it a go but only if you are a fan of german beer/lager
4
Stayed next door to this restaurant/tavern. Good quality beer brewed on site but really enjoyed the freshly baked pretzel. Service was very good as well.
3
This is a restaurant which is there for a very long time. We have heard that in the beginning it was a good restaurant, but nowadays they have more complaints. Only there beer is allright.
4
Great place to stop for a beer and good German food at a reasonable price. Very popular and usually packed out at the weekend so arrive early for a table.

As I've been in several of these around the world, this was your typical Paulaner Brauhaus, It was convenient, being across the street from the Suntec convention center. The food and beer was good. But if you're a foodie, there are better options obviously. The service was OK, and the bill was quite high. There was a band inside, so we sat outside so we could have a conversation
3
To be really honest, the food is quite average. Prices are more than average but considering the portion of it, I guess it's a fair pricing. The location and atmosphere is nice though, and beer is good. When it gets crowded it's a bit hard to catch the waiters attention but I guess that's how it goes always

This restaurant is good for those who like Western food and alcohol. I found the food to be very poor in general. The home-made sausages were okay, but they weren't special.I don't drink beer, so I can't comment on that. I had ice-tea which was very plain.The place has a good atmosphere, but it can get very loud with large groups. It more a place to celebrate than a place to sit down and chit chat peacefully.I would personally not return again. There is nothing special about this restaurant.

We had a few beers and food here back in September when the Formula1 Grand Prix was on.... Got to say the food was great although the servings weren't big. The staff were friendly and helpful, the venue had a nice feel about it. The beers were nice ... Although the beer and food were pricey, we would consider going back again.
5
My friend (a German national) and I went to this place as it was right next to the hotel we were staying at....liked it so much that we went back a second time.The servers were really nice and attentive, but it was during the downtime between the lunch and dinner rush hours. My buddy ordered the currywurst and said it was really good; I sampled it and thought it was okay, but it is his favorite German dish. I ordered the Schweinshaxe and was not disappointed. Regarding the bier, just as good as any other Paulaner beer I have drank elsewhere in the world.The bathroom is up three flights of stairs....once the seal is broken, get ready to get some exercise in.Also, there is a smaller Paulaner Wirsthaus in the Clarks Quay area of Singapore, went there as well. Did not go inside, enjoyed a few cold ones outside while people watching. Check it out

Hard as it is to believe you can find a taste of Germany in the tropics. The atmosphere wasn't exactly a German Brauhaus but it was close. The food was good and the service quick. The servers were very busy and at times we felt a little forgotten - the food made up for that shortcoming. We had the mixed wurst plate - it was served piping hot, large servings and tasty. If you are looking for a cost savings you can get most items on the bar menu if you dine before five pm; even at that hour the place was crowded
4
We didn't eat here but wished we had. We went in for a glass of beer on Saturday afternoon (valentines) then went back and had some wine after our valentines dinner on saturday night. The staff are really nice and there is a lovely atmosphere here. Definitely will revisit next time we are in Singapore
4
The beer was excellent and the food ideal to match a weissbier. Near to the Conrad hotel and very chirpy staff. Excellent for a cool beer on a very hot evening.
4
The dishes that we have tried are well done just like in Germany. The beer selection is good but could be a bit bigger. The service is above average but could improve a bit.
2
I had 3 beers, the beer was good. But the corn chips was terrible. Everything was cold, the cheese, chips and salsa topping with tomatoes. The chips are not crispy, it look like and taste like it was prepare 2-3 hours ago.
4
I went to Paulaner Brauhaus for a late lunch in November. The restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. The service was god and the food was great. My craving for schnitzel and beer was satisfied!
2
We arrived today in Singapore and because we stay at the Conrad and this place is located downstairs,, we thought we have some diner here. We order curry worst with fries.Asked twice for mayonaisse and get it when my fries where cold.Fries served cold, so actually not the best quality. We told I assume the manager that we are waiting for mayonnaise and our fries are cold, nothing happened after that.Not worth the mone
4
On Saturdays they have a great deal: a huge pork knuckle with sauerkraut, bread dumplings and two half liters of beer for 40 dollars, which for Singapore is incredible. The pork was tasty and you get to choose which beer. Definitely worth a visit as the restaurant setting is nice
5
Our family is not into buffets. Chose this place because of the kiddo's birthday. Well-priced sunday brunch plus kids corner & activity. Perfect! The food was pretty good. The dessert was yummy!!!! The teenagers in the family appreciated that it was not the usual Chinese fare. The men had tons of beer and good German beer food. The kids were playing in the safety of a kid's corner and the ladies could catch up happily. The ambience is lovely. The double volume ceiling brought in lots of natural light. The woody Bavarian feel and the quaint decorations made the restaurant cosy. That's why we stayed and stayed..... Thank you PB for the lovely afternoon. Everyone had a great time.

Few things make a city great like its cuisine. Singapore has it all.Over the years, I've always found myself craving a cold German beer and something other than Asian -- no matter how excellent it can be here.To find this chain here, conveniently located across from the Conrad Hilton, was a pleasant surprise.It is your classic brew pub and its selection and quality do not disappoint.The menu, while limited, offers enough to remind you of Munich (including pig's knuckle), especially the sausage platter.Don't be surprised to find this place full during the week and on Saturdays. It is very popular with locals
3
I had a short lunch stop at the Paulaner before heading to the airport. It's comfortable with a relaxed atomosphere and attentive staff. It was a little pricey (though perhaps the noem in Singapore) and the pork schnitzel I had was a bit chewy and not the best I've had. German potato salad was quite good and as always the German wheat beer was superb
5
Paulaner Brauhaus is centrally located at No. 9 Raffles Boulevard. Here we got good German food and tasty German beer from its own brewery. A little weird feeling to eat German food and drink German beer when it is 30 degrees and high humidity. Paulaner was, however, one of our favorite places because we really like good German food and beer, and we got it here. Interesting to note is that some smaller pubs (including one that was no more than 300 meters from the brewery) sold Paulaners beer they had imported from Munich, as this was considered finer. Talk about going over the river after beer ..
4
Stop for a quick bite to eat before we headed to the airport, enjoyed a cold beer during 2 for 1 (at noon) and the Pork Schnitzel was excellent.
3
This place does what it says on the tin, German beer at Singapore prices ~S$16/500ml. Ambience is OK, staff are a little slow, and it's a shame the litre isn't discounted!
5
The food is nice. Served by friendly people. Kid has program to be engaged. Free flow of beer if you like. Definitely will come back again.
4
Place to go for nice beer and carnivorous diet. Nice place to hang out with a big group of friends and not be called rowdy or rude
4
I confess that I am not into German food but I do love Roasted Pork Knuckles and I can't get it too many places. I had a craving tonight and the Paulaner Brauhaus satisfied it to a T. Service was fine and the price was reasonable for the huge portion. The Pork's Knuckles (Schweinehaxen I think) were as good as in Munich at the Hofbrauhaus. Can't speak to much else at the place
3
Location and the venue: is very good, authentic Bavarian beerhouse atmosphere, we like it.Service: was between poor and average, it took very long to get the attention of one of the waiters and we didn't had a very welcoming feeling.Food: The beer has been served with ice (??) we haven't ask for ice, the tomato soup was way too hot,it need 10 mins to have the first spoon, the potato's in the salat wasn't cooked properly and for the roesti the cheese and ham were on top of the roesti and not sliced between as roesti are served in Switzerland. I hope the general manager read my feedback, because this issues can be easily fixed and I would to have a great Bavarian restaurant in town to hang out more often

My colleagues and I chose this restaurant because of its proximity to the Conrad. With all of the restaurants in the area, we could have walked 10 steps further and been more satisfied, or the same number of steps in the other direction to Subway for a much better meal and service.The only decent thing was happy hour: two for one on wine and beer. I did enjoy two (less than half full) glasses of a nice Spanish wine and my colleagues had good beers. That's where it ended. After a 30 minute wait, my tomato soup tasted straight out of the can, with a little cream on top. It was scalding hot - okay it was soup, so I won't complain. After about 15 minutes, the temperature was suitable for sipping. One colleague and I ordered the meat loaf over potato salad appetizer with fried egg for our entrees'. This arrived another 30 minutes or so after the soup. The potato salad was average, but there is a reason I have never consumed Spam, and I wasn't about to start with the slab of who-knows-what was on that plate. But technically, I suppose Spam does qualify as "meat loaf'. When asked, one of the service personnel said she thought it was pork, but I think she was just guessing when we voiced our displeasure. Summary: there are SO many wonderful restaurants in this area. Skip this place, even with the lengthy happy hour (which must be the only lure). The place is definitely understaffed and that's probably why our main server had an "I don't want to be here" attitude. The servers who actually brought the food and checks (after 30+ minutes for the check, ,and another 30+ minutes for the final bill to sign) were a little sweeter. This doesn't help the fact that I felt like a hostage with bad canned food
3
My husband loved his Schweinehaxen, which was authentic and a huge portion. My Kaesespaetlze was nothing like it is in Germany, or indeed what you can make from a box. The beer is brewed in the brewpub in Singapore, not in Munich. Staff were friendly and, by Singapore standards, prices were reasonable
3
The tuesday happy hour with 20% off kept me for longer than I might usually have stayed, but the "giant coiled sausage" was neither giant, nor coiled (just two normal thin sausages wrapped around each other...).It was OK - as I was there by my sad lonely self, some wifi access would have been a nice addition.I was looking for a really nice hit-the-spot meal, but it didn't quite make it.Beer was reasonably good, though, and as per usual it's probably a lot more fun with friends
3
This place has very good German food with a a very wide selection and great beer brewed on premise and via bottles. However, this place is extremely expensive, thus catering to those on expense accounts. If you have a budget to live by there are better options for German food and beer in Singapore. If expense is no option, this place is great. However, from some very strange reason, since they cater to the business crowd, they do not have wi/fi or convenient electrical outlets to charge up. Very behind the times
4
Best place in town for a sausage whit a brewed beer like the Munich Lager or Munich Dark they also have a seasonal beer on tap!!!
4
Conveniently located with the beer garden about 100m from the door of Pan Pacific.
Food upstairs in the restaurant is very authentic and tasty, beer is quite expensive but very good also.
4
Great house beer particularly like the pale lager and they do have decent choice for those who are not into beer be it wine or spirits, had asked for a JD coke one of those days when I didn't feel like another beer and it was really well mixed, don't know what they did but the proportions just seemed right!Food is hearty and usually comes is large portions, ordered their German twist on pizza one time bcos the sausages were just too much meat without starch and it turned out to be this large and rich concoction which was tasty but me & wife had a tough time finishing it...They also have a band doing their gig on the beer making apparatus which is nice nothing particularly great overall nice buzzy noisy place until unless you want to sit outside which is little tightly packed or upstairs which is usually a little too quiet
4
We came off the plane and stayed at the Mandarin Oriental (a stone's throw away) and wanted somewhere to get a good meal before quickly retiring to shake off the need to sleep.The food was great - we have lived in Germany for a couple of years and so feel confident in saying the food was truly Germanic!The beer was good - although it seemed expensive - partially offset by the two for one offer, but still tasted great!Atmosphere lacking - but hard to criticise this as it was a Sunday evening
5
Enjoyed many a pint here during a stay in Singapore can be a bit pricey for a beer but its worth the money have never eaten here as not into German food just the beer which is brewed on site, plus on a Sundays it's buy one get one free on large beer
1
Had to stand up and grab a waiter watching the sky for service. Hardly any English let alone German spoken, but credit is up after a few bites: either show your credit card or settle in cash now! Suspect the owner was once scared by an unpaid bill or Singaporean "culture" frequently includes walking away from the tab. Anyway, quite an opportunity loss created by poor and uninspiring management
4
We have been to Paulaner BrÃ¤uhaus in Singapore for quite a few times, and we will probably go back again. At the moment, it is the only German microbrewery in Singapore. We usually sit in the bar but as this particular day, the pub is full and with a larger group, we decided to go to the restaurant instead. As usual, we had our usual pork knuckles as well as sausages, among others, which were washed down nicely by the freshly brewed beer. So far, the food and beer did not disappoint
3
We went to Paulaner with a group of friends. I really enjoy the atmosphere there, the design, and all that. Quite a big plus for that, it stands out in Singapore. The food was okay, but nothing special. Some of it didn't quite have the right taste. Size of portions varies, some are proper but some are small. Now, the important thing is beer, since it is supposed to be a brauhaus. We were disappointed to find that they only offer 3 kinds of beer and actually one of them was unavailable because of a technological problem, so we were left with 2 kind of beer. Beer was good, especially for Singapore standards, but come on, every hawker's centre has a bigger selection available. We hoped to make use of the happy hour because otherwise beer is quite expensive (1l for 30 SGD). Unfortunately, the directions we were given were wrong and hence we've arrived at Paulaner shortly after 8pm. Staff have shown no flexibility which is a shame, made me continue the evening elsewhere. We also found it rude to be given the bill without requesting one with the waitress waiting above our heads for the money
5
Just ate here and the food was amazing. My boyfriend works in Germany and we have spent a lot of time eating there over the past few years. The pork knuckle and pork shinitzel this evening was some of the best German food ever outside of Germany!! The beer was also excellent!Really recommend this restaurant, it is very traditional with a bar down stairs and large German style restaurant upstairs. Really gave us a break from noodles after travelling around Cambodia and Vietnam for the past few weeks!The service was super quick and friendly- overall - fully recommend this place based on our excellent experience this evening
4
We simply love this place not only for the food n beer but simply the atmosphere that make one feel so comfortable. I love to drop in with my hubby for our usual order after settling our kids or at time whole family came over for dinner. The food never once fail especially the goulash and our favourite pancake. Not forgetting to mention their lovely curry sauce than we dip it with almost anything. And of course the staff n the crowd are simply decent n not noisy crowd.
5
I like this place. But my only two reservations are: a simple wurst mit brot would be nice and a side dish of dumplings should be on the menu. Not sure why it can't be? Simple changes = happiness. Everything else was just great!
5
I had the Hungarian Goulash and it was wonderful. Sunday boasts half price beers until 5PM. Very friendly staff.
3
We ordered lamb shank and crispy pork knuckle - both were great, along with its sides. Decent place for a nice meal.. and if you wanna come together to watch soccer and have some beer, it's great too! =)
4
A German Restaurant that brews teir own beer. Real Pub atmosphere and basic German food. Nice for a relaxing lunch or evening out with friends.
4
Was in Singapore on busines and suddenly got craving for German food.Was staying at a nearby hotel so dropped in to try this place.Had the Goulash soup and the Wiener Schnitzel with fried potatoes.Service was kind and attentive and the food came fast and was very well tasting
5
The service is very quick and attentive. The food is simple but the menu is ample. They even have pizza and pastas. The local beer is excellent. Overall a great venue. I went with 2 kids (8 & 4 yrs) and we sat outside and the world go by
5
Was here with my friends. The freshly brewed beer is really nice out here.. Go for a lager if you do not like strong flavors. If you like them then stout is the way to go... The menu is not very elaborate but has some great options.
4
We came here for lunch a couple of times on our holiday as we were staying just next door at the pan pacific. We enjoyed the food, we got the German meatloaf and potato salad, fried camembert and sausage platter lunch special. It wasn't overly expensive and was a laid back place to have a some decent German food, enjoyed lunch both times we went although warmth from the service staff was a little lacking. Overall it was a good meal and the beer is great
3
Paulaner Brauhaus was never a location we frequented with planning ahead, we just ended up going there when in the area around SunTec and having a craving for some rich food and a beer. The atmosphere is not that great and the food is quite average compared to other choices for German cuisine in Singapore in the meantime
4
A colleague and I ate at Paulaner Brauhaus a few nights ago. We both enjoyed it. I would recommend the sausage plate since it has five different types of sausage to try. Also, make sure to order a pretzel and a beer to wash it down with
4
Food was alright but expensive.
Glass of beer $18++
5
The food is great and their in house dark beer is a good choice
5
Originating from Bavaria, I really recommend this place for the quality of the beer. Also very nice to experience a bar that serves non alcoholic beer in Asia.
3
Is it a bar? Is it a restaurant? Is it confused?I understand the bierkeller concept but this misses. It tries hard. Some of the food was amazing. The pork knuckle was a feast but the steak and goulash left me ordering a second dish. And what about vegetables???! What's wrong with offering some? Will come back but only for the knuckl
3
After a week of Asian food we looked forward to a change. The beer here is terrific but the schnitzels were small, not particularly hot and a bit greasy.One good point was that we asked for a small change to one of the dishes and we were accommodated. Another is that the atmosphere is lively and the outdoor setting takes advantage of the great weathe
5
A little bit of Germany in the heart of Singapore. We enjoyed a late dinner in the pub and loved the live entertainment. The beer was excellent as were the salads and food. Food was as good as in Germany â€“ this is a Munich restaurant. Service was prompt and attentive and they kept the water glasses filled which we appreciated having come in from a hot Singapore evening
2
I went to Paulaner Brauhaus as I had a meetup event there. It is a big place, but what surprised me was that it was really very empty, which is usually a bad sign. I ordered goulash, which was nice and tasty. My second meal was schnitzel, which was decent.I find this place to be overpriced, S$ 33 for an ok schnitzel? The worst thing was when I was about to pay. I was told they don't accept nets (that never happened to me before) and when I asked where is the closest ATM for my bank, no staff member could advice. I felt very embarrassed and had to borrow some money from a friend.I won't go back ever
4
I always recommend two things to try when visiting this place: Their Lager and Dark beer! Their dark beer has a deep malty taste which seems that "men with chest hair" would have enjoyed. The Lager. Has a lighter and perhaps a sourish taste that is best enjoyed by ladies. If ever to try both, do try the lighter lager first before the dark one. I did it the other way round and the tasted buds were not tasting the beer at all
4
On the corner with two fllors, live band and large screans for football, my only complaint is the beer! I find wheaty/heavier ales a problem in the Singapore heat so stick to Tiger - but this beers are popular all over the city so I must be a minority. If only this was a bar in London...
5
the Paulaner in Singapore is unlike the one Shanghai not a pickup point for hookers. In Singapore there are other places. instead this restaurant offers phantastic Bavarian Atmosphere which comes close to Munich which I can truly certify having livved there for 8 years. just the music is rather Filipino then Bavarian.actually I went there many times already.Obviously, not too many Bavarians go there as this restaurant clearly also attracts the local croud but for example the German Dragonboatteam is a regular here as a other Germans. They deliver the beer for parties within the Gman community in Singapore such as the parish celebration of the German catholic community here etc etc
4
The varietry of beer served and pork knuckles to go with it - just excellent!
1
is asian style, not authentic german foods n beer at all.
worst of all is the staffs there, if u wanna have happy hour with yr friend there, they give u the opposite.
3
Tried the pork trotters but it was not crispy. Nice ambience but food was not great
3
I recently went to Paulaner for the Sunday brunch buffet with a big group of people from work for our staff Christmas meal.The food was very good - as it was Christmas there was turkey as well as many other kinds of meat. My favourites were the pork knuckle and the meatballs. There was a dessert table and ice cream and quite a few salad items too but I didn't try anything apart from the main course buffet as after two helpings, I couldn't eat any more (shame!). The beer was very freeflowing and I would recommend this buffet over any of their normal al-a-carte menu items as the value for money is so much better.I've eaten here a couple of times on a normal day and it is quite pricey, so I think the buffet is the way to go (best to make reservations as it's very popular)
1
I fully concur with the previous reviewer flyawayy .. the food and the service at Paulaner are simply unacceptable - given the fact this is a franchise, ..I am surprised that Paulaner Munich allows this place to continue the way it is. Being from Munich, my business clients here in Singapore often specifically asked me go to Paulaner ..and I often enough reluctantly did. My last experience there was so bad that I simply refuse any further visits there. What they serve as Bavarian food has nothing to do with Bavaria or Germany for that matter. The staff, especially management, need to go back to courtesy classes and take a course on effective F & B management. Even the beer from the microbrewery has nothing to do with the original Paulaner beer. If you want to go to a well-run Paulaner with a semblance of Bavarian flavour...skip Paulaner in Singapore and visit the 2 outlets in Bangkok ..franchise is owned by an Indian gentleman who is doing a great job. So if you want good German/Bavarian food and original Bavarian beer, - try Brotzeit up the road ..its cheaper too
1
We wanted to settle for a nice German meal, enjoying some comfort food.Unfortunately you can see and taste that the food is done without passion. Certainly not what I would have expected from a Paulaner Brauhaus.The potatoes we had to the Schnitzel haven't been fried enough and were missing some salt and pepper.But worst was the "Classic" flame bread which was served with Sauerkraut instead of sourcreme. First we thought they mixed up the orders, but have been told then that this is the way the "Classic" Flame bread is done. Being from Germany I could certainly tell that this is not right. The kitchen wasn't willing or able to prepare another one without Sauerkraut. Instead the Chef tried to give us a lecture on his menu writing and the expectations to a German restaurant in Asia. I life since 10 years in Bangkok and have had some of the best classic German food there, so I rather saw this as a lame excuse.In conclusion a very disappointing experience as we were missing the passion and service mind of the Chef, which unfortunately couldn't been made up for by a very hard trying service team.Would not go there again
4
If you do not take my reviews of Restaurants serious after this one, I don't blame you. I know it's German food, but so damn tasty and well presented. Hence the full score on the food. The music, to whom has ever been to Munich, is not German at all and the staff response doesn't fit into the German stereotype. No smiles, no response after a small wave of the hand. What happened to "ordnung muss sein"?Anyhow, really recommend to a night out of a different kind with good tasty food
5
Went looking for a "casual beer" and some food. Across the board, veery good and reasonable. Only negative: I asked for a "house lager" and got a wheat beer. When i pointed this out to the manager, he told me that it was the lager. I've had a few beers over the years and know the difference. Bottom line, he replaced it with "another lager," so no harm, no foul.Good place to go with friends for a casual meal
4
I enjoyed a night at the Paulaner Brauhaus with a Singaporean friend who recomended this restaurant/bar. The place itself is dominated by the large brass brewing container behind the bar. Ontop of which a couple of bands usually perform.On the night I had a a Currywurst Sausage and my friend had a Pizza. Both very tasty and came out very quick. The service was attentive and were able to offer us happy hour disounts.I would definatly recomend this venue to anyone staying in Singapore
1
Well, I can’t say much good or bad about the food, but about the difficulties to get any. Any food or drink, that is.I went there planning to join some friends for an hour or so and to eat a bite and get something to drink. It took about half an hour to extract a menu from quite arrogant staff. (“Yeah, yeah, sure…” mumbled from the corner of one’s mouth, if someaone asks for something for the third time, means “kiss my *ss” in German culture. Apparently the stuff IS well adapted to the theme of the venue.)The menue itself was apparently all that was on the menue for the evening, I didn’t manage to get someone to take an order for the other half hour, and left after a bit more than one hour.I can understand that the staff was under a lot of strain that evening, they were very busy, mainly with first returning credit cards to people who where not the card owners, and then trying to retieve cards and invoices and re-match cards and owners.The menu looked decent, though a bit overpriced. One thing I have to say in their favour is that they got the decoration right: The chairs are exact copies of the horrible, back-breaking iron folding chairs you find in many German beer gardens. Kudos to that.There are many places in Singapore that offer good food and good service. I’d recommend the bar and restaurant of the Conrad hotel right across the street, if you want excellent food and service at Millenia walk, or Werner’s Oven on the east coast, if you are dying to have authentic German food

Best fort beer.

Went to Sunday brunch. Very very good value!! Free flow and buffet for less than 50 bucks!
3
Average German fare, not a big fan of Paulaner bier, check it out if you like hearty nosh.

A good beer drinking place for chilling out after work
5
Great varieties of sausages & german beers! Guten Tag!
4
cant wait to try sunday buffet! nice sausages
3
Love the variety of sausages and the tasty pork knuckles. Cool street signs ambience.
4
Standard German food and beer place. One of the few places you can try the German Pork Knuckles.
3
Pork knuckle!!!
5
this was the first bar/pub i went to. sab brought me seiya and reina there (in the audi back then) there a couple of times on lazy sundays. it was always pork knuckle, sausage platter and wedges. never really ate upstairs though. and my first taste of german beer all came from there. got me hooked. i still head there frequently
