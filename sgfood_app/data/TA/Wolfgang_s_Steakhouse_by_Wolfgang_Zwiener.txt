The steak smell and started bad. The sides were very poorly done. I had two A,Eric and with us and I was embarrassed. No, this kind of food and prices charged is not acceptable,

Came as couple for dinner.
The place is very loud ...dont expect to have conversations..simply bcs it is not possible.
The food is average, steaks are ok but overpriced significantly.
Overall nothing to be exited about...

Our family of 5 enjoyed our meal thoroughly. Service was very attentive and friendly. What amazed us was the great value set lunches. My kids who are 15, 13 and 12 have nothing but praises for every dish brought to them. The set lunch menu is of great value, ranges from $50-$90 dependent on the choice of entree. The most amazing part: it is available weekdays and weekend! Would strongly recommend a visit

This is a really expensive restaurant (think well over $100 for a steak before tax and sides) and the food is actually really average and the service clumsy. I am from New Zealand and know a decent steak and there are places here in Auckland that are streets ahead of this place that offer a steak for $30 NZD. Firstly, the service was clumsy with glasses knocked over, plates just slammed down and it was apparent staff training wasnt high on the priority list. The food was bland and vanilla and the steak (Sirloin for 4) was cut down the grain (should always be across) and almost in cubes which made it very tough to eat. Lastly, ordered a 2013 bottle of wine and happened to notice they were pouring a 2017 version. Note that this was removed from the bill but only after some 'pressing' negotiation.Average place - if you want the US type steak experience in Singapore stick with Moretons etc

The food at both restaurants is very good. The differences are mainly in terms of style, and you see that in décor AND service: (Although it is located in a shopping mall) Cut is more formal, while Wolfgang (located in a ‘5-star-minus’ hotel) is friendlier and more relaxed. Normally, I find the ‘standard’ piece of beef and two sides the maximum food I can gulp down in a meal. Unlike Cut, Wolfgang is open for lunch, so you have the option of having the same cuts of steak but in smaller sizes, and thus able to enjoy more of the restaurant’s offerings; in this regard , the set lunch (comprising 3 appetisers, a salad or soup, a steak, 2 sides, dessert, and coffee/tea) is extremely good value. The accompaniments are good but not exceptional; the steaks are the real thing. Our party ordered and shared the Cajun rib eye, tenderloin and petit filet mignon. They’re all very succulent and irreproachably satisfying. The wine list caters to various tastes and purses. So, Both Wolfgangs are to be commended - Mozart at two different stages of life. Unless you want a very high-end dining experience (but then, why steaks?), Wolfgang seems to be the better (and more economic) choice.

So overrated, but my biggest peeve was the service.I would actually rate it as very decent service if it was a casual cafe, but it was horrible for a casual-fine dining restaurant (and for its price point).- There were waiters talking across the room and over tables.-They wld gather for chats while standing on the service floor.- One guy was shuffling his feet as he walked around.- Another was scratching his back while serving a table.- One of them placed dirty plates on another clean & set table, while he was clearing a another table- Service was slow, despite being less than half full.- And lastly, this could be their directive, i dont know, but the waiters were way too loud and chatty. Not very appropraite for a restaurant of this status, nor for business lunches. If it was some hipster cafe, i think it would be very much welcomed. I could hear a waiter making small talk with group of what seems to be a business lunch of 8 gentlemen several tables away. Telling an inappropriate joke.Most of the dishes were mediocre at best. The saving grace was its steaks, which were well seasoned and cooked, and was of good size too.Sadly, i doubt i will be heading back any time soon. The decor is a little passe as well.

Most of the sides were disappointing, but I MUST SAY the steak is a solid play. Dry aged so the steaks are buttery, tender and fragrant! I loved the presentation and serving portion, and while it is expensive, it's worth a birthday splurge! Get a 12 year Lagavulin, and you're set

My husband and I came here on Friday night, as we just love a good steak. Although the reviews weren't that great, I decided to give it a try. We were shown to our table by a lady and when she wanted to give us the menu, an overly keen waiter snatched the menu from her and said something about 'her doing his job'. Didn't quite get that, but ok. My husband went for the shrimp cocktail ($43) and I had the lobster bisque ($22) as starters. Again, the overly keen waiter arrived and placed the food in front of us and was just making a big thing about it, it was almost a bit embarrassing. The other staff didn't seem to like him either, I saw one guy shaking his head when he took the plates from another waiter, something's wrong with that guy. Anyway, I didn't really like my soup, I've had many lobster bisques before, but this one was not great. As for the shrimp cocktail, the shrimps were huge, but my husband said the sauce was a bit bland. In addition, I thought $43 for 4 (I think) shrimp (although big) was pushing it. Our main courses (filet mignon and petit filet) arrived shortly after and I have to say the steak was great, very tender and nicely seasoned. We ordered the German potatoes as side dish and it was ok (a bit bland again), but then $22 for potatoes.. not cool. We had 1 cocktail, 1 beer, 2 glasses of red wine and 1 double espresso, no desert and the bill was $420. Too much! We left disappointed and will not return, although the steak was really good

Came here for birthday celebration for my wife. Order a Tuna Tartar, which is rather interesting to us, Clear Chicken Soup and Ribeye Steak. Service was good and they even split the soup portion into 2 for us knowing that we are sharing. Steak was not the most fantastic but I prefer this than Cut @ MBS. A must try that I recommend will be their NY Cheesecake, nicely done and one of the good ones around. Knowing it’s my wife birthday, they gave us a complimentary tiramisu and energetic display of singing the birthday song. Entertaining

Omg. This must be the most overrated steak house in SG or anywhere on planet earth. Appetizers were mediocre. Steaks were below standard. Fyi cooks are not American, only local cooks. This is supposed to be an American steak house btw. Seriously do not even waste your money. All the positive reviews are from people who do not understand good steaks. Go to Jack's Plac

Went there for a birthday celebration. Service was great. Didn't manage to try a lot of what's offered, so will definitely be back. Much better than CUT at MBS.

Had an enjoyable dinner here. Service was attentive and the steaks we had were tasty. The place was packed

Tasteless and overpriced, snobby atmosphere - my partners food was terribly plated/cold so had to be sent back and my food was inedible (was taken off the bill)

I booked this restaurant for a romantic dinner for two with my wife. When we arrived the place was pretty busy and there was a large table with a family group which appeared to contain uncontrollable children who were banging on glasses with cutlery and screaming loudly. We were shown to a nice table around the corner from them but from time to time one of the family members felt it was a good idea to share the love by carrying various screaming babies over by our table. This ruined what should have been a pleasant experience. The food and service were excellent but for what they charge I would have expected a more pleasant experience. The whole restaurant was very noisy

I order a Pc of sizzling bacon, potter house for 2, cream spinach, German potato and a glass of Manhattan as my partner was still hung over from ny eye. Total bill $300 which is the average I will spend in a steakhouse... maybe closer to $400 if my partner ordered a drink and if we ordered dessertThe plus points- sizzling bacon not too salty so it was nice- porterhouse i like the sizzling melted butter mix with the beef juices.- German potatoes was nice tooI have been to CUT, Morton’s , chris ruth, wooloo mooloo, Gordon’s grill and now Wolfgang. I don’t really frequent these type of traditional American steakhouses cos for the money Spend I prefer getting some good Japanese wagyu with shoyu , salt, wasabi & fried garlic chips. So far all these American steakhouses give me similar beef tasting experience....wooloo mooloo was a bit more memorable cos it came with Aus jus sauce.I believe Morton’s told me my last visit With them was 6-7yrs ago.

Doesn’t get any better. If you love meat, and meat at its very best, then this is the only place to go. Food portions are huge so unless you haven’t been fed for a week or are ‘fresh from the cave’ it’s a good idea to share your mains. The lunch menu steaks are more than enough and are delicious. To be honest you can’t go wrong lunch or dinner. Oh, and the bar is a great place to enjoy a glass or two of wine and a lighter lunch!!! Thank you to the team, led by Danny, for a lovely family lunch!

We came to Wolfgang’s for dinner late December, and the restaurant was really busy. We were a party of approx 20, and they managed that really well.The food was simply fantastic; great steaks, fries and spinach. We also had some really tasty seafood for starters, including lobster and Oysters.Definitely recommendable!!

The food and service far more than made up for everything that hostess, Siti Aisah (known as Sandy) has done. For a start, we were punctual but was made to wait. We understand that it's Xmas eve and the restaurant was packed. When my husband went to check with the hostess again on the status of the table, she shouted and pointed at him and even talked him down. It was embarrassing for him in front of other guests and she placed her problems on us in a very unprofessional manner. There was never an apology for her rude attitude. Since it's Xmas eve, my husband decided to focus on having a joyous dinner first and deal with this unhappy experience later on. The service staff which comprises of Suraj, Nickson, Mickey and even Sam were spectacular and immaculately attentive. Dishes were prompt even when the kitchen was busy. The Seafood platter was fresh and highly recommended for sharing. It was a good effort from the staffs to manage our expectations for the portion of the food (American size). The Ribeye steak is one of their key signatures and truly lives up to that name

Went for lunch. 3 of us shared: 2 lobster bisque soups (waiter automatically asked kitchen o split into 3 bowls), a shrimp and avocado salad, porterhouse for 2, creamed spinach, lobster mac and cheese, creme brulee, sorbet and tiramisu (comped by restaurant). We had two glasses of the Mendoza Malbec and one Chablis. The soup was delicious if slightly over salted. The steak was beautiful, it was large enough to feed 4 though! Other than slightly salty soup, everything was delicious and service was attentive and professional. In January they will introduce set lunches, cannot wait!

Had a delightful dinner with my husband on Christmas Day. The reception lady was standoffish, gave an unwelcoming look and didn’t apologise though the table wasn’t ready yet when we arrived. I finished the entire sizzling rib eye steak which was around 550g, well marbled, flavourful and yummy with the old fashioned sauce. The yellowfin tuna was super fresh served with wasabi and soy sauce - good value and sizeable. Chopped salad with the peas and corn was light and refreshing too. Wonderful service by Melvin which made the difference here. I dislike service staff at fancy places who only push for the expensive items on the menu. Melvin, however, did his best to propose options which suited our preferences. He was honest, helpful, friendly and gave good suggestions for our orders. Dessert options are predictable and standard here so we just tried the Apple strudel. Other wait staff were also quite attentive during the dinner though it was crowded. Will definitely want to try the seafood platter the next time when we have more people dining.

Steak was phenomenal— location great and service very good. The downside are near ridiculous prices!

This place is located in the newly opened intercontinental hotel by Robertson Quay. It’s got a chic atmosphere and the food is amazing.
Excellent wine collection too!!

For a restaurant that charges the price of the likes of Morton’s and Wooloomooloo, the experience at Wolfgang was disappointing.1) Service. The staffs are clearly not well trained. Firstly, coordination among them was poor. When we were already ordering with a service staff, another lady came by to present us with the drinks menu which was originally already on the table. The service staff who was taking our orders quickly took the drinks menu away. We were also asked if we’d like sparkling or still water twice. Secondly, the staff have a strange habit of extending the table after the guests are seated. We noticed that they do that for almost all the tables as there was a constant “banging” sound when the extend the tables. Thirdly, as service staff M was pouring us our ice water, i asked him what was the catch of the day. He didnt stop pouring as he was answering me, and the water was poured to the brimof the glass. He actually commented in Singlish “aiyah see la, i talk to you until like that”, and he poured the excess water back into the flask. This was definitely appalling!!Secondly, the plating of the food was horrible. See the photo of the jumbo crab lump cake and you will understand. The way the dish was plated simply makes it unappetising and makes the serving looks miserable. Lastly, my salmon was unevenly cooked. While it was medium, there was a part in the centre that was raw!! And the sides were overcooked. This is really unacceptable for a restaurant.It was really a bad experience - food, ambience and service.

Joined for a small Christmas party of nine; the front of house were very accommodating and upgraded us to a private room without charge. The restaurant is relatively small and snug, beaming with the subtle eloquence and authenticity of a traditional NY Steakhouse. Even the waiters were dressed as they would be in Wolfgang's in New York!Now then ... the food.. we're recommended the Fried Bacon as a life starter; until now, I never knew you could elevate the taste of bacon!! Well done, I congratulate you! We ordered 7x Fillet Mignonne Steaks and 1x Porterhouse (serves 3); the steaks had that dry-aged, deep meaty flavour and was melt in your mouth quality. Unfortunately, not everyone had their STEAKS cooked to the desire temp, and that's not acceptable when you paying $80-110 for a steak! For sides, we went with Creamed Spinich (8/10), Creamed Corn (6/10), Lobster Mac & Cheese (10/10), German Potatoe (9/10) and the Cottages Fries (2/10)... felt our expectations were missed managed on the Cottages Fries; they were described to us as thick long fries (British chips), but it was basically a flavourless Potatoe Crisp (Lays for example)... [NOTE: We did raise our disappointment this with the waiter, and a Potatoe substitute was offered free of charge].The only thing that pi$$ed me off is that my colleague felt ill and couldn't finish his steak. We asked for all the leftover food to be packed, and they never included the meat. I'm annoyed because he left more than half of his steak which was a meal in itself. With a few beers and a bottle of Champaign, the meal came to $1457... it was very good, and I enjoyed the meal and felt the waiter service was good; it's maybe not my first choice steakhouse if I'm laying put $200 for a meal, but it's definitely worth vistiting and I'd recommend the German potatoes as a side of choice!

4 mature guys - end of year business sum up combined with friendly meet. Immediately hit by Siberian grade cold, 89-ties music and looking at menu steep prices even for SG. Friendly staff, very service minded. Bread butter sparkling water. One in the company goes home quickly to get a sweater. We ask for reduction of AC and music volume and maybe something is done. Menu is typical American grill. Meet size is big. Ask for grams or ounces and suggested splits. All tasted well but we ended up screaming because of sound volume and we left for a downstairs outdoor wine on the deck. This could be a great place but it needs a number of tweaks to get cost and welcoming. No green plants and a bit sterile environment. Plus the cold and the dated very rhythmic music gave us a chill. Therefore - 3/5 score.

The entrance is not too easy to find, but the restaurant is sufficiently welcoming. Good service staff, and the aged Porterhouse was good to experience, but the tenderloin portion is too soft. I would have (only) the striploin next time. First time trying aged beef. Was expecting something strongly tasting of minerals or "blue cheese", as people keep expressing, but for me it was a subtle, pleasant taste.I enjoyed the creamed spinach that wasn't too rich, and the cottage fries were a nice textural change. The restaurant sauce was like a BBQ sauce, and it does go with everything.I preferred this experience compared to the 2 other (American chain) steakhouses I've been to locally. Will go back again

I've not been to Wolfgangs before but have been to Peter Luger in Brooklyn, along with many other Steakhouses in NYC and around the world. I also dry age my own meats at home so you have a little reference to my review and passion. New York steak houses do the best dry aging hands down. Having the right meat, the aging process and cooking method are so important to getting that funky taste. Wolfgangs pulls this off very well and tastes just like being in NYC. It's incredible to have a real NYC Steakhouse in Southeast Asia.Wolfgangs has been opened less than 2 months so still working out the importing and service. But the porterhouse is perfect and I'd even say better than what I had at Peter Luger in Brooklyn. Cream of spinach and German potatoes are classically done here. Cheesecake is ok but not as good as in NYC. Service was great but could still use some polishing for this new restaurant.I'll be back for sure for a taste of NYC

We made dinner reservations at Wolfgang's intending for this to be a rare, special night out. In the end, the experience was so good that we promised ourselves to return as often as our cholestrol levels and finances allow.The restaurant is swish but totally child-friendly. Not in a crayons and kids' menu kind of way. But the wait staff were so accommodating. And it's open for super early dinners.Wolfgang's serves old school New York fare such as porterhouse steak and creamed spinach. The steak arrived thickly sliced with caramelized edges, the plate tilted so that one can collect the juices, just like the way THAT steak is done at the venerable Peter Luger's.But whereas dining at PL's for me involved gruff waitstaff, an intimidating, nearly all-male clientele and walking through a dodgy neighbourhood, Wolfgang's service was a masterclass in gracious and warm hospitality. And you still got THAT steak. The service staff are experienced men and women who made us feel at home. The waiter Halim was a true gem. Our child broke a glass while drinking from it, and Halim handled it with smooth professionalism. What minor bugbear was, while the restaurant faced the Robertson Quay river, its floor to ceiling windows were thickly frosted, which totally blocked out the lovely water view. But hey, some people need their steak and their privacy. Cost $400 for starters, steak, dessert and wine for two. I would recommend it for dates, business entertaining and family meals

Was recommended by my colleague to try this steakhouse. Not disappointed with the experience. Service was fast and efficient and we had the streak bacon, lobster bisque and porterhouse. The steakhouse which was dry aged, came medium rare and was delicious and moist. We also had the key lime pie which had zingy filling and chunky crust. The atmosphere was lively and the restaurant was 80% filled on Tuesday night. Recommend for another visit 
4
Our porterhouse was perfectly done. The sirloin especially was flavourful. It would not be complete without the beautiful creamed spinach. Key lime pie was amazing!Service was good, except some teething issues - wait staff was not well coordinated and they mistakenly gave my table to someone standing in line behind me. Had to wait an extra 20 mins because of this. Please work it out
