We ordered ribs and it was subpar standard. Worst of all the malt is so diluted and soft. Please revisit the Billy Bombers in the US. Really disappointing. I EAT, I DUMP, I FLUSH

Tried the specialty ribs with BBQ sauce, delicious. Quick service, lovely staff, really nice place for a meal, reasonable priced too. The banana split is a treat as well

Off course, you can go more better more higher one. But less than 25 SGD for shake, soup and Hamberger is not felt so high.
Price and taste are nice.
Yes, you also can choose rare, medium or well-done.

I am so happy that I visited twice this year before what it seems to be a closing down for good. The Marina Square and Cineleisure Billy Bombers outlets were where we had birthday surprises and large get-togethers when we were younger and it was so nostalgic to have visited them again. The service crew were amazing, and the 1 for 1 on the entertainer app made the value outstanding. A pity that they we will no longer be able to taste their exceptional milk shake, which at about $8 is pricey but so very worth it. What baffles me is that the base is just Walls ice cream, not even the higher grade B&J or HD variants. So long my beloved Billy Bombers

Called in for lunch on our way out and had a burger and milkshake. Well, this is a burger! Good size, not too big but with all the essential ingredients including cheese , bacon, tomato and not too much mayo. Milk shakes were thick and creamy. Customer service is very good. When you just want a good burger and no fluff ! Also fries were good

First, I would like to establish how brilliant the staff were - patient and waiting on us with service that you would normally find in six star hotels. That we could use the entertainer app to get main courses 1 for 1, all the better.It was so pleasant to find an outlet of Billy Bombers still open, and relished the chance to eat at a place that we went to for special occasions as kids. It seemed that the prices have remained almost unchanged over all these years.The ribs were so brilliant, we were left craving for me. The steak was okay, but did not blow our minds the way the ribs did. The fries were also so-so. But the milkshakes were pretty good. Retrying childhood favourites often leave us disappointed - but I'm so relieved that the milkshakes were rich, thick, smooth and best of all, tasted great!Will definitely come back again for the next special occasion to enjoy the brilliant vintage decorations and the nostalgic food! Hopefully the chain will see better times ahead

Singapore has a huge range of restaurants however as we live in Asia we really wanted an American diner fix. We found this place tucked away on the second floor of the mall. Outstanding service, extremely friendly and helpful. The food was good, we had ribs one night and went back for fish and chips another night

My husband and I decided to visit Billy Bombers on 19/11/16 following a long day of touring around Singapore. We ordered two chicken mango salads, a cookies and cream milkshake, a sprite, a banana split, brownies and two weak lattes. The manager and waitresses could not have been more helpful or welcoming. Our mango salads were absolutely delicious and the manager and chef were happy to accommodate my husband's request to have my boiled egg. The banana split was really delicious and decadent and I polished off all my husband's wafer biscuits while I was waiting for my dessert to arrive. One of waitresses noticed this and brought over a plate of wafer biscuits for me. How nice was that! I really, really love wafer biscuits. My brownies were warm and delicious and the coffees were just the right strength. We were the last table to leave and all the waitresses and chefs wished us goodnight. It was the first time that has ever happened to us. I would have to say this was the best customer service experience we had in our nine days in Singapore

Pay a visit to this American diner concept restaurant in Clarke Quay Central during lunch time weekday. Not so much of a crowd cause it was situated on the upper floor of the mall. Service is good , food serving quite fast. I ordered a mixed grill along with a cup of root beer float. Food taste is average, nothing to shout about

i am very unhappy with the quality of food we ordered from billy bombers in Singapore. Although it had fast service, the burgers had poor buns and nothing inside except a beef patty. I ordered a chocolate milkshake and a blue bacon cheeseburger, which was meant to come with mixed lettuce and tomato with onion. I had NONE of the above... I had a burger with tiny pieces of pork and a beef burger. The beef wasnt even flavoursome. I am terribly disappointed considering i paid $33 SGD for mine alone.. not taking account of my brothers order which was equally disappointing

Whiskey baby ribs, something special, its tender and tasty. The little bit of charred flavor is just amazing.
Root beer float to go along with the meat seems like a match in heaven. The place is decorated thoughtfuly with classic photos and items.

like the american food....connection to my USA visit. no fuss food. quick service. food taste - basic. its a mid-range restaurant.,,,not cheap. like it as such. but not sure if we'll visit again.

I was not very much impressed by this restaurant. Everything is as you will expect from an average american diner, plus few downfall. Hamburger patty was way smaller than the bread, like hidden into it. Tho It was good and tasty, well cooked. Fried calamari were very gummy and not tasty at all: clearly frozen. Chilly was good actually

I have been frequently visiting this restaurant for many many years. Food wise no much changes and still very nice. Food well presented and fast delivery. Service staff, male manger and female staff were excellent. They will try to make you very welcomed and patiently waiting to take order. You will not feel rush to make orders and to have your meal.Good staff and ambience very western. Every time when I came here for dinner, I felt like having food at home.Price is reasonable, need to order drink as water don't come free

We stopped by one afternoon strictly because they have malts. We had already had lunch so we didn't try anything besides chocolate malts. They were nice and chocolaty but I couldn't really detect any malt flavor. The atmosphere is really fun, but I agree with a previous reviewer who noticed that many of the booths have been torn and they patched them up with tape. Not the best looking way to go about it, but it wouldn't stop me from going back

An old style Diner, I probably should have tried the Burger but i went the steak and potato salad.My friend had the seafood paradise spaghetti. it was very good.The Decor is ok, the service ok.The Perrier was warm.There is a obscured view of the Singapore River which it faces.it is upstairs in The Central, opposite Clark Quay on the River

Ordered set meals but we believe the food could have been better and the sets could be more welcoming. A bit ''stingy'' with what being served. Average quality. Also, please repair the seats instead of using clear tape to tape the torn areas. Not really feeling like an American diner. Appetisers and main course served together

Billy Bombers is set up like an old style American diner or hamburger joint as we would say in Australia. Interestingly enough its furnishings, atmosphere, colors, story re founder, etc are identical to the Billy Baxter chain elsewhere. Is it a coincidence?? Nostalgia got me in the door but unfortunately while everything is designed to represent the old style diner and eating experience, the food itself does not. It seems like they have tried to modernise the ingredients and have not stuck with the basics of the tastes of the era

This restaurant is located in the mall opposite clarke quay and is styled out in the usual american diner way ( plastic chairs, false signs etc ).We started with the wings which were excellent, the banana milk shakes are also nice n thick and gloopy. The burgers for the main course were a bit disappointing, the meat was a bit flavourless and the mayo didnt really add to the flavour,The price was expensive for what we had ( 15 pounds each ), but I guess your paying for the theme..

Went into this diner this evening, looks good, feels good, food good and tasty. However I should have received a free refill of my soda as described in the menu, but the waitress never returned to check if I wanted one.I would also recommend that you check your bill as we did not until I happened to look at it back at the hotel, and found an item we had not asked for or received.Because of these couple of of things I have only graded them a 3 (Average
