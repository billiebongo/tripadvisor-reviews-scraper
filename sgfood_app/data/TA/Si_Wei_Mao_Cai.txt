went there many times. like the skewers there. they did not serve for a period. but it is good its returned.

It was our first visit after having been to the outlets in HK, the one here seems to be average, perhaps slightly localized to suit the local tastebuds. It was a bit pricey too. However the service and ambiance was good.

Sichuan was great. The only annoying thing is the beef in chilli oil is not really value for money as it has more vegetables than beef
2
服务蛮快的，菜味道一般般，我们点的辣子鸡我个人觉得不够麻，价格偏高，俩人花了90块钱也没吃啥，两份凉菜一份荤就是...要吃川菜不如等到回国内！
Definitely a bit overpriced and far from being authentic sichuan cuisine, the laziji had no peppercorns in it enough said... Service is fast and attentive, wont come back but not a catastrophic experience overall.

Hubby and i took the chilli challenge today at #siweimaocai with some authentic sichuan food! this place has rave reviews and it did not disappoint. We tried the si wei boiled fish fillet in hot szechuan pepper sauce, the fragrant pepper chicken with rice and hand made dumplings we’re leaving with runny noses and teary eyes but very very very happy tummies! ☺️☺

I absolutely love this place. I get here every time I'm in Singapore, without fail. Great food at a great price. The Ma Po Tofu, the chilli chicken, and the fish in chilli oil are all spectacular. Can't go wrong if you like chilli and those beautiful, amazing and special little Szechuan pepper corns. Get here if you can
4
This place is always packed whenever I visited, so reservations are highly encouraged. Several of my friends from Szechuan recommended Si Wei Mao Cai as their go to place whenever they want their "mala" fix. Recommended dish: the boiled fish cooked in mala hotpot, stir fried cabbage, mapo tofu

I travelled to Singapore for honeymoon. We went to Si Wei Mao Cai for lunch. The place was very easy to find (but you need to remember the chinese character of the restaurant). Its a small restaurant by the alley. We ordered spicy fish soup, schezuan chicken (don't remember the exact name), and veggie. Everything was very lovely since we both love spicy food. The taste is very complex, we love the Mala taste and sensation bursting in our mouth. Very best eating with rice! Its in a large portion, the soup could be eaten by 2-3 person. Will go there again absolutely

I love spicy food so it's a wonder it took me so long to discover this place. I was expecting a very local hole-in-the-wall place as was common of many Chinese eateries in the area but this place was surprisingly cosy. The wait was long during dinner time, we went at 8pm and was seated by 9pm. Once past 9pm, we see walk-ins being seated almost immediately. If you can't get a reservation, just drop by before or after conventional dinner times to avoid the queue. The bf and I had great sze chuan food during his stint in the U.K. and we were certainly using those as benchmark. Not all the food were spicy enough for my standard (but I eat really hot) but they were all tasty. Not the best I had by any means but one of the top in Singapore for sure. Don't expect service here, it's all very prompt and brusque. But at 9pm, all we wanted was for our food to be delivered fast so no complains there. We recommend the chilli fish, selection of veggie in szechuan soup and the century egg appetizer. The chicken la zi Ji was unfortunately lacking the oomph and spice.

Si Wei Mao Cai, Located at 33 Mosque Street in the Chinatown area, this new Sichuan restaurant Si Wei Mao Cai serves traditional Sichuan Cuisine. It is a little gem, if you love spicy Sichuan food, I must confess I am lover of spicy food and have to admit that this is by far the best I have tried in Singapore. The cuisine is very authentic, and the food is so fresh, tasty and is packed full of those delicious Sichuan spices. The presentation is also very nice for Chinese food. The setting is casual but the table settings are great and the staff very friendly....you will not be disappoint your heat buds. Highly recommended
4
The place is very busy and extremely popular. Good Chinese food in a regular ambience. Nothing fancy. Go for good food only. Cannot relax or have a conversation here
4
Introduced some local expats to this place. Their opinion is that is the best chinese food in Singapore. And one of them has lived here 4 years.
No fancy decor or service. Just very good tucker.
4
Situated right in the midst of Singapore's Chinatown. Authentic Sichuan dishes at a reasonable price. Caution for those who can't take spicy dishes: the dishes can be rather spicy.
5
Si Wei Mao Cai offers great traditional Sichuan food, prepared and cooked based on traditional recipes from the owners grandma.The portions are huge, so you might consider sharing it.I love and recommend the poached cabbage together with the fish filets which are covered under a pile of deliciously seasoned chili spices.Go there if you are tired of the "standard" pseudo Chinese tourist food....

I ate her for dinner once. I found it very crowded which can be a good thing but it was poorly organized. The food was good but I felt the menu was limited and a little over priced. While it was good it didnt wow me. I enjoyed it but I think there are other sichuan places that are better
4
Probably the most authentic of Szechuan restaurants in Singapore. Every dish was cooked well. Mala Fish really stood out, likewise the "Salivating" Chicken Ko Shui Qi. The deep fried pork intestines and "Hui Guo Ro" are must haves! Friendly and warm service too, which is a plus. A real gem in Chinatown
5
Spicy food doesn't go very well with me but that did not stop me from returning to it multiple times..OK I admit it was my gf who loves the food there and I have to follow her..haha anyway it is simply the most authentic Sichuan food you can find here. Service is great, food even better. It is usually crowded so get there early to avoid waiting. Parking is difficult too if you are there during dining hours. An advice is to park at Club Street and cross the road to Mosque Street
3
I have been to this restaurant a few times. The food is truly delicious, if you like spicy stuff. After their refurbishment a few months ago it looks like they also professionalized their services. These days you can reserve a table which was not possible before. However, I made a reservation the night before my friends and I were going and although confirmed we were not on the list when we got there. I had to show the phone number I called once she could not find us on the reservation list. Then one of the junior servants started to talk to me in a disrespectful way as if I was some kind of kid trying to jump a queue. It's that I like their spicy food that much, otherwise I would have left the place with my friend in tow
4
This place gets busy, especially during dinners / weekends. Delighted to find my favorite side dish in China here - chilled wo sun, as I was unable to find it anywhere when i moved back from China. Other than this, recommend the ma po tofu and the grilled eel with buns as well
5
It was my first time trying Sichuan food and I will certainly be back for more! This restaurant might not look fancy but their menu is extensive and the food delicious. It was completely packed with locals on Friday night so booking in advance is recommended. We ordered chili chicken, fried beef bites, cauliflower with pork and double-fried potatoes. Chili chicken was nothing special, but everything else was really tasty, not as oily as some other reviews said and not too spicy after all. Will definitely go back here to try out more dishes
5
So much better than the tourist traps around Chinatown! Great restaurant, but very busy. The wait is worth it!
5
Mao Cai is especially great! Also try the cumin meats! Service is friendly and quick. If you like hot and spicy, you will love Si Wei!
3
The restaurant was ok, but not special. If I lived here, I would not return. I'd rather try another. S$60 for 2. Maybe we ordered too much.

I visit Chinatown every now and then, and have tried many of the Chinese eateries in the area. 思味冒菜 seems to be the better one in the area, and it is the only one where I have visited for a few times. The place is usually quite crowded around dinner time. This time round I dropped in after 9pm and it was not so crowded as most of the diners were about done with their meals. There is a decent selection of meat (fish, frog, etc) and vegetables in the menu to select from. My favourites are the fishes (different species to pick from e.g. catfish, eel, etc). Service is quite prompt and the waiting for the food after the order has been placed is typically quite fast (about 10 to 15 mins).
5
Have been to this place a couple of times now and it us definitely the best Szechuan food in Singapore. It gets very busy at the weekend and bookings are essential, clearly many others feel the same way. Our particular favourites are the spicy fish fillet soup "Shui Zhu Yu" (bad pin yin sorry) and the stir fried green beans with ground meat. Both of those items are pretty spicy. Chilli chicken is another good one as long as you have a glass of Snow Beer to hand. Staff are fast and efficient this place will not disappoint. Just remember if you don't like ultra spicy go with "Shao La" (small spice) in order to survive.

It is highly unusual that one should feel the need to re-write an initial review for a place. But after a second visit last night that was exactly what I felt compelled to do. I wrote a glowing 5-star review only two weeks ago. But last night was a sore disappointment. The food was simply unpleasant. It was incredibly more spicy. Well, it is a Sichuan place, you may say, what do you want? But it was gratuitously spicy. For example, they plumped a huge fistful of red chilies into our vegetable soup. This was not on the menu, nor did we get them the first time we visited. Worse, the meats and mushrooms were incredibly salty. It literally felt as if they tipped a whole container of salt into our meal. That definitely would not have been part of the recipe. So all in all, a massive let-down
3
Two of us ordered tea tree mushrooms and steamed pork yam. It took a while until they serve it on our table. Maybe because we came at 5pm, right after they finish their lunch break. But the staff who took our order is quick and nice. The restaurant is clean and quiet, it's not a big room but they have outdoor seating.The tea tree mushroom is not as spicy and delicious as in China (of course), i love sichuan pepper, so this is less spicy for me but it was okay. And my mom liked it too. For the steamed pork yam, both my mom and i don't like it. Mainly theres only yam, with a few slice pork in it. I wouldn't order it again if I visit this restaurant again
3
place known for authentic Chinese cuisine also has a wide choice for vegetarians, the food is spicy so instruct while ordering if you want it otherwise. Quite popular amongst the locals so better to have a reservation. Both service & food ok..but good value for money
4
Very good service and staff. They helped us with or order as we worried about it being to spicy for my 5 year old daughter. But quite a few dishes are very mild. The food is definitely on the oily side so be aware. Overall great flavours
5
Amazing culinary experience. I enjoy Szechuan food but usually they are just tongue-numbing experiences with every dish tasting pretty much the same. However this place is different. Everything is so savoury in its own way. Been here 5 times and always had to roll out afterwards. Good with groups of people as you can try a larger variety
5
Given an option, I would fly down to Singapore every week just to eat here. My first advice, do not wear tight fitting clothes (note to self. ...your stomach is not a bottomless pit but has a limited capacity). For the first time I tried the sliced pork in chili oil. The first bite was taken aback as this was chilled. Thought of asking them to fry it up when I bit a cucumber and realized this is a salad of sorts. Once you get over the initial surprise this dish is delectable especially the chili oil which we wiped off. My usual staple here is chicken fried with dried chillies and egg fried rice. But the chicken was a tad disappointing for few reasons, 1. You have to really hunt for the small pieces of chicken buried in the chillies and 2. The chicken pieces were not spicy and a bit under done. But no one really minded thanks to the spectacular stir fried beans, yes you heard me right BEANS and sliced potatoes. The last time they had recommended a chicken with celery and water chestnuts which was a dream. Couldn't find out in the menu this time. A must visit in China Town.
5
Fantastic food and great value served in a supe clean establishment. Friendly faces to serve you and really tasty dishes. We even had a satisfied non spicy food lover agreeing to the exceptional flavours created. A must stop in Singapore if you know the real thing as this is truly authentic
4
Fairly inconspicuous place in Mosque Street but serves a very varied assortment of what seem to be authentic Sichuan dishes. Everything I tried was high quality but I especially enjoyed some pigs intestine and chilli. I found the staff to be efficient and helpful so don't worry at all if you are unfamiliar with this kind of cuisine or if you don't speak Chinese - I would certainly say the service is better than average for a relatively casual place such as this. A bit on the noisy side but overall the experience was an enjoyable one
5
There are plenty Sichuan restaurants in Singapore and I've tried quite a number of them. This one, no doubt being ranked the most authentic one in my List. Nice food with reasonable price. It's also conveniently located within walking distance from Chinatown MRT Station. Always full house during weekend so it is strongly recommended to make reservation in advance to avoid disappointmen
5
This location is just one block over from the very touristy Pagoda Street, but this avenue is remotely travelled. But the venue has popularity and on most nights has a line waiting at the door. Best time is on Sunday night around 6pm when you will have the place mostly to yourself but some items on the menu may not be available. Not well signposted in Englush so you need to know the address: 33 Mosque Street.This restaurant is not for the faint of heart. Most dishes are slathered in red or green chiles, but you may be able to negotiate when ordering to get it a bit more tame.We ordered beef with Palm (served cool, not so spicy but very fragrant), chile chicken (lots and lots of chiles but tasty), steamed greens (very plain but a good offset to very spicy food), and fungus (mushrooms) in sesame oil which was so much better than I would have expected) and rice.Service was prompt but you may need to flag to them when finished so you can pay.And the prices here so much more reasonable than a restaurant just 1 street over. If you go to Chinatown for a good meal, choose this one

This was just around the corner from the hotel (Bliss Hotel) I was staying in and so I decided to give it a try...It's a pretty simple place which has basic decoration and table layout (a bit like a cafÃ©) but the staff were friendly and there were a lot of local's eating here... In fact I was the only Western origins diner.There are quite a few things on the menu that most Westerners wouldn't probably go for, like several Pigs Intestine dishes and things like Chilli Frog... But there are a good selection of Pork, Beef, Chicken, Fish and Vegetable dishes as well.I opted for the 'Fragrant Chicken' and some 'Stir fried Eggplant' with steamed rice and a Diet Coke on the side and it was piping hot, fresh and very tasty. I like my chilli's and these dishes did not disappoint in the chilli department! If I had one small negative it would be that both dishes were quite oily... But still delicious.As for cost, each main dish was SG$18.00 with steamed rice just SG$2.00 and a can of Coke SG$0.50. A 10% service charge is added on the end bill.Note that the name in English is not displayed outside the restaurant, so look for the Street No. 33. I attach some photo's here that may help

This place is amazing! Stubled upon in and walked in because it was packed with locals. Sat down ordered the beef slice (comes in hot spicy oily broth) and added golden mushrooms and lotus vegetable and a small rice for $17. Huge portion with really good spices, cilantro and penuts on top..Best meal I had in Singapore! This place is amazing and i miss it already
4
Came here a few times already, mostly for group gathering. The place inside can be a bit crammed, so don't bring loads of stuff along.Food-wise, they do serve some delicious fare. Just take note that as with all Sichuan cooking, it tends to be oily. But hey, it's flavourful!More available at http://www.effandbee.sg/si-wei-mao-cai-sichuan-cuisine

being sichuanese, i am always looking for authentic sichuan food yet with a bit touch of modern cooking touch. this one simply offers me the best combination. the only downside i would say is that the restaurant is a bit too small and noisy sometimes but it is cozy feeling
1
Went after reading raving reviews fr TripAdvisor reviewers. But sadly the food was waaaay too oily, even for szechuan n chengdu food. The pork was dry n overcooked.The fish in spicy soup was just unremarkable although spicy.The fragrant chicken was Ok. But I expected more. There was no service n the tables were dirty when we were seated down. I don't think I will be coming bk...If it was in szechuan or anywhere in China, it'd hv rated v average
5
We had a remarkable and inexpensive meal here. The chilli chicken and the cumin beef were spicy and amazing. The place was also crawling with locals, which is always a good sign.
Highly recommended!
5
Hole in the wall with the most authentic spice schiuan food i have ever had ! Highly recommended - Must visit on a chinatown trip !
5
When you have people queuing over 30 mins to get in you know you are on to a winner!
Great Food, Great Find

Been there a few times for Sichuan food. The Mao Cai was good but other dishes were not as delicious. We ordered stew beef potatoes, one of their signature dishes, and it came in cold on the inside. We requested the waiter to heat it up but the food came back in five minutes and turned out to be very dry. I believed it has been microwaved instead of pan-fried. After this incident I will never patron this place again
5
This hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Singapore's Chinatown serves authentic Sichuan cuisine. I could have easily been eating in Chengdu. The boiled beef in Chili sauce was very spicy, but not so overwhelming as to unbalance other flavors. The Squid with fresh chili peppers was terrific as well, and the vegetable dish we had of Chinese yams with tree ear mushrooms was a refreshing and unusual antidote to the spices of the other dishes. Service was pleasant, and prices are reasonable. A wonderful experience
5
Mosque Street is the quiet cousin to neighbouring Pagoda Street, the unofficial capital of 'tourist China Town'. However the restaurants on Mosque Street have more Singaporeans and less tourists in them. Si Wei Mao Cai was the busiest and we took the last free table. The food was excellent, I saw plenty of authentic sichuan options including the chilli chicken and shredded potato dishes I ordered. Menu is in English and Chinese. I drank a Snow beer.

It is tough to believe that a gem of a restaurant like this has so few reviews on TripAdvisor! It definitely needs more hype. LocationThe tiny nondescript restaurant is located in Chinatown and can be easy to miss in the long line of small restaurants, shops and other eateries. Food & DrinkThe food is fiery and spicy, heavily laced with piquant Sichuan pepper and plenty of red and green chilies. Your tongue will be on fire, so ordering some cold beer to go with your food is a good idea. The chicken and fish dishes we ordered were absolutely delicious and swimming in chilies and pepper. The portions are huge so going here in a group of four or so is a good idea. Service & StaffThe attitude of the staff ranged from polite to indifferent. We hardly had to wait for our food. The problem with this restaurant is language – nobody speaks English here. We had a Chinese friend make the reservation for us over Chinese Twitter. However, when we wanted to move up our reservation by half an hour, it was quite tough to get anyone to understand over the phone. We ultimately had a Chinese cab driver speak to them on the phone and got the reservation changed. AmbianceThe ambiance is really nothing to crow about. The setting is very basic with ordinary tables and chairs placed quite closely together. It can feel very cramped. Definitely not a first-date, romantic sort of place! Try not to look into the kitchen from where you’re seated. The food may be delicious, but my guess is that hygiene standards in the kitchen leave a lot to be desired.Value For MoneyThe portions are really huge – by far the biggest servings I've seen in a restaurant. Definitely good value for money here.Overall ImpressionLousy ambiance and unremarkable service and staff, but the fantastic food makes it completely worth your while. Tips For DinersMake a reservation. If you want catfish, you will have to order a day ahead. Be prepared for communication problems since hardly anyone speaks any English here. The spicy food is not for those with weak stomachs and sensitive palates used to blander cuisines

We visited this place twice during our stay in Singapore. The food was absolutely amazing - the best Sichuan food we had during our month in Asia (and we had quite a bit of Sichuan food). We especially enjoyed a fragrant chicken dish with loads of chilies and sichuan pepper. The location is busy and quite noisy. The tables are also pretty close together, so this isn't the ideal place if you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner. We can definitely recommend this place and will go back if we ever visit Singapore again
5
The food is this restaurant is by far the best Sichuan food in Singapore!Absolutely delicious and authentic.Highly recommended dishes: catfish, beef with dumplings and fried potato. Beautiful.Portions are huge and hence if you come in a large group it's quite economic. Some dishes are incredible value. This draws a lot of young people and in particular Chinese people staying in Singapore. Problem is this restaurant gets really busy after7pm. You can make reservations but most of the time they don't keep a table for you which can be fairly annoying to wait half hour despite the reservation.During the busy hours the place is generally understaffed. So don't expect much.It's a very basic setting there btw so don't go there on a date or so.The food is nevertheless awesome and makes good for all the shortcomings!Enjoy

I've eaten here twice in the last week and have been rhapsodising about it. The menu is short and simple, and very authentically cooked and presented. Particular recommendations would be the duck and potatoes stew, fish fragrant aubergines, beef with cumin and braised tofu.For the quality of the food, this place is outstanding value. The restaurant itself is pretty simple, but it's clean and the staff are friendly. It does get full at weekends, so booking recommended.Not all the staff speak fluent English, but they are all very helpful and will ensure that English speaking staff look after English speaking diners
