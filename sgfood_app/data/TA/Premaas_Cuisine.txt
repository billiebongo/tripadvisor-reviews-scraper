Its really a hole in the wall, but the food is great! The service is very warm too. We ordered the chicken biryani, a Kerala chicken dish and some rice to go with it. Loved it!!

Was a crowded place and service was very bad. The veggies along with the meals were very less and not up to the mark.

Try Malabath Chicken Biriyani once. sure you will eat another potion. It's really tasty and fresh. This time was my 4th time which i ate the same Biriyani potion.

If they like coconut curries, appam, and tasty goat meat, this is where you should take your friends.

Premaas serves great tasting authentic kerala food. But the portions are stingy and leave you wanting. The place is also slightly dinghy and the service indifferent. But the taste of the food makes up for all of it.

Premaas is so perfect.They serve rice which is NOT Basmati. And it is a blessing. Pet peeve vs Basmati - as it seems to be drowning out all other rice varieties.They have some of the best fish ever.AND, they have Kappa Biryani! Its a tapioca biryani which is to die for. This place is a must-d

TIP: Remember to call them upfront and check if they are serving Appams. Sometime they don't. That's the way it is. This is a small, cozy place at one corner of Little India. Makes it slightly difficult to find. The place and ambiance is nothing to talk about, and nor is the service, but wait till they serve you the food. I love the black-peppery-ness that is a typical signature of Mallu food. I am a vegetarian and therefore have very limited options here. My favorite combination is: Kadala Curry + Appams + Veg Biryani + Kingfisher Beer. That immediately takes you into the food heaven. My non-vegetarian wife loves the chicken curry, so it's all good. This has now become our regular go to place, and frankly I like it to be the way it is. No swanky ambiance and a whimsical servicing. Both have it's charms :

We went as a family of four for lunch as we had heard rave reviews about this place from a highly foodie friend. Kerala veggie food is close to my heart and the rest of the family love any non veg. It sure didnt disappoint! The owner was warm friendly and helpful. The banana leaf meal I ordered was awesome. The vaayapoo(raw banana flower) vegetable was excellent and something I hadnt tasted in years! The goat curry, meen polichathu was great too according to my hubby and children. The appams were soft and spongy and yummy. Only downside was the space was a bit congested due to extra chairs ay each table. The ambience was cosy and warm. Loved the place, highly recommended and this is going to.be a joint which we will visit time and agai

We went early, around 6pm. Not many customers then. Food took some time to come but was cooked freshly. The jeera briyani, mutton roast, Bindi fry and chicken perittal were good. The Bindi fry only came after we had finished the rest of the food. Overall a good visit to taste authentic Kerala cuisine
4
We ended up in this restaurant bit by chance and choosing it by the fact that all the costumers where Indian families having lunch on a Sunday. It did not disappointed. Very tasty food with some Kerala specialities. Small place and spartan decoration, but real food at a very fair price
4
Good and tasty food served on palm leaves for a good price. Came for lunch and the place was packed. Ther serve alcohol. Basic interior.
5
The atmosphere needs to seriously improve as the ambience and "speed:" during rush hour can get pretty crazy.
5
Best Duck Curry ever! If you want to try Kerala food, this is the best place to visit! Chicken curry is also good and beef fry is a must try!
5
I have been suggested by one of my client to visit this restaurant. Very nice authentic kerala food offered here.
Freshly prepared and served here.
lots of variety of nonveg and fish served here.
I would like to visit again here.

I came here with some coworkers for lunch on a Friday. They were very busy and the service suffered a little. The food was overall pretty good though and the prices were very reasonable. I'll be back.
5
Hands down the best Meen polichathu we have ever had. The taste keeps bringing us back to This restaurant. The kappa biryani, the Appams, the puttu are all absolutely delicious, so is their goat curry. Nothing here will disappoint you. Highly recommended. Premaas, Keep up the great job

If you love the ethnic Kerala (Malayalee) food, vegetarian or nonvegetarian, served on a plate or on the traditional banana leaf, this is the place for you in Singapore. The food is authentic Kerala, and you would not miss your home! Lunch hours are crowded, but the service is prompt and fast. The place is run by a couple and their personal touch is everywhere there. Surprisingly, but pleasantly, they are not interested in expanding; they are committed to keeping the standard high. The dinner is more leisurely and the owners are available for suggestions. Do not expect luxury in the room, but the food qualify for the luxury slot. Please note, if you do not know the language, Malayalam, you may find a bit of difficulty to spot the place - the signboard is in that language

Real North Kerala food served with a smile. Cleanliness is satisfactory. Taste is authentic. Try any fish dish and you won't be disappointed. Decor looks slightly dated and tired, but in a way, it reflects the timeless cuisine of the ancient land of Malayalis. Sitting in a surgically clean, sterile room surrounded by modern paintings and futuristic furniture, opera music playing in the background is definitely not my idea of enjoying delicious, down-to-earth Kerala meals! Have to say this, these Singaporeans are lucky

In search of an authentic Kerela meal, we ventured to Dalhousie Lane (near the Verge, but difficult to find if you are driving from Jalan Besar) to this charming little family-style restaurant. The food was as nice as we hoped, with a lovely goat curry, appam with crunchy edges, and ladyfingers to die for.
4
Its good restaurant for South Indian Food lovers. We went for Lunch meals served in banana leaf. Service boy is not energetic to serve fast. But taste good

Probably the best Kerala food i have ever had. The biriyani's are a must try. Visited thrice in a month already :) . Takes some time to deliver though, Weekends are packed so better to go during weekdays.
3
Came here for lunch today and opted for the mutton biryani and a mango lassi. The biryani was a little dry for my liking with perhaps not enough mutton. Probably should have opted for one of the more traditional Kerala dishes. I'd come back here again but next time I'll try something else

You come across great places to eat now and again, some are good, very good, great and then you find one which just blows your mind, for me this was Premaas. Not a fancy, high class establishment by any means, tucked away in the busy and manic Little India, Singapore but boy, what a menu of South Indian delights.My wife and I travelled with a group of friends in need of sustenance, it was quite late so my friend had suggested Premaas so we all thought why not give it shot. It was busy when we arrived, hardly surprising to hear that given it's a restaurant in Singapore and Little India but the food smells were as authentic as you can get (so I am told).We ordered a medley of differing dishes, ranging from prawn, mutton and chicken curries, to fried fish and plenty of appams. By far the best food I and I include my wife here too have ever tasted - simply astonishing in the presentation on a traditional banana leaf, to the execution of the dishes, flavours, ambience etc. I could go on here but I won't.It's definitely a place to try and believe me you won't be disappointed

Premaas, I believe, is a spin off from the original Aashirvad Restaurant on RaceCourse Lane. They do a pretty good job of the fish and meat dishes. But they're pretty stingy with the vegetables that accompany their meals. I recommend the fried mackeral, appams and mutton stew

Well, this place is probably the most under-rated of all the Indian restaurants in Singapore. With all the big names stealing the limelight, this place is hardly known to the tourists and visitors. Thanks to its modest appearance and interior (not very far away from the happening place of Little India though) location. This place is quite familiar among the locals and foodies like me. We go there quite often for their basmati rice biriyani and chicken perattal. I've never been a great fan of kerala food, but I was completely taken aback by their biriyani. I had a pre-conceived notion that the coconut oil smell would overpower the aroma of the food, but I was completely wrong! The biriyani is so aromatic and appetising. The meat has always been succulent, mild flavours and tastes brilliant. The chicken perattal is equally good with rich flavours and spices. I would always love to try their fried chicken legs if there is some room in my tummy. I don't eat fish, but I've heard great things about their signature dish - "Meen Polichadhu". It's the most famous fish preparation in Kerala. The fish is steam cooked with rich spices and presented in a banana leaf. Being an authentic Kerala restaurant, their parottas are exceptionally soft and tasty as well. This place cannot house more than 25 people I reckon and the waiting times could be longer when it's full. The ambience isn't great and its a bit cramped for room, but the quality of food defeats all the cons and it's also understandable that this place is not for fine dining and you go there only for great food. We always call them 30 minutes ahead and place our order to save time. This place is definitely in my favourites list and would certainly recommend for all foodies

What a find. Tucked away at 6 Dalhousie Lane, near the Little India Arcade in Singapore is an amazing little Indian restaurant. Unpretentious, charming and totally delicious food that makes your mouth zing with each bite. The breads are a delectable treat to be enjoyed when you visit this special little place

Small place, run by a family serving nice food from Kerala India.The Curries are amazing and they go best with Appam's. Something very different.Atmosphere is nothing great. Food is served on Banana leaf and they recommend you to use your hands to eat in traditional South Indian style
4
There may be other kerala restaurants with better options, but Premaas is by bar the best option in terms of the taste as well as money. If your budget is low and you want to have some quality kerala food, this is the place you need to be! Recommended dishes: Ghee rice, prawn mulakitathu, chicken pepper fry
