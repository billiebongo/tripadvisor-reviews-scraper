This place like a joke.!! Ruddiest staff ever seen.!! Bad attitude.! We went there with friend for couple of drink. Couldn’t believe the attitude never been such situation in my life .!! Worse service ever been.! If you don’t like your job don’t do it.!!

We ate twice at the Clarke Quay location and were never disappointed. The servers were efficient and super friendly and the food was delicious. The happy hour two-for-one beers were welcome after a hot day sightseeing.
1
Don’t waste your time. In a city full of restaurants, it’s amazing this one still exists. Some of the worst Thai food I’ve ever eaten and they admit to using MSG. Please avoid
3
The service is slow, the food is average but the location is great. We enjoyed the satay and green mango salad but the pad thai was very average. It's okay but I have been to much better Thai restaurants in the city.

i went to Renn Thai at night with my dad and his family who live in thailand. if it's not raining and the temperature isn't too bad, it is very nice atmosphere to eat out by the river. the food however was very mediocre (good, but not memorable thai food). more importantly, the service was incredibly terrible. it was severely understaffed (i think i saw two wait staff for the entire patio). they brought our food at completely separate times and also forgot to bring one of the appetizers we ordered. it was also a bit on the expensive side considering the service and food quality.bottom line, this place is completely about atmosphere and nothing else. probably better options along the river
2
We chose this restaurant as many others do. Just by chance while walking around. BIG MISTAKE!!!!! Food nice on pictures in the menu, but half as nice in really. The taste is very under average. Overpriced even for the location! The service was extremely slow, rude and absolutely not professional. Even Christine who was signed as Senior Manager (and me personally would expect a little bit of professionalism) was just terrible!
5
It is one of the best thai restaurant i visit in Singapore. They cater for every type of diners, one of my colleague were vegetarian and gluten free. The service staff were running and still able to serve with a smile. Green curry and tom yum is one of their best dishes. For the dessert they have rice with mango and it is so good. The price is reasonable compared to other restaurant around the area

Our group dine in on this restaurant last night and surprisingly the food is superb. The service was not that fast coz i notice they have to get it from the back and we are seating at alfresco. The entree satay was ok but the sauce can be improved. Tom yum hotpot looks astonishing and appetising. The thai curry crab is a must try, it was pricey though but worth it. Beer got promotion which makes it more better. Definitely will come back again when i visit singapore again
1
We were seated quickly and started to look over the menu which was huge! The prices seemed pretty high but we were hoping for some really nice Thai food. Started off with some chicken satay which was terrible. Chicken skewers were tiny and dry and the satay sauce was a runny puddle of nothingness! The tasting plate was ok, some spring rolls, fish cakes and skewers. After a disappointing entree we awaited mains... one main came out which was the bbq mixed plate consisting of chicken skewers, squid, fish, mussels and prawns. Most of the food on the plate was cold! The squid was chewy and the mussels were so old and dry I was worried I’d drop down dead then and there from food poisoning! The other mains took about another ten minutes to arrive and when they did we informed the waitress of the issues. Her response “well what do you want me to do about it”! She then tried to blame the fact the fan was blowing on the plate for the food being cold. No, just no! She agreed to replace it with a hot one. After about twenty minutes and after the other three mains had been finished another waitress came out and said they cannot give me the same meal because it would just come out the same and there was nothing they could do because I didn’t like it. She asked what else I would like however I wasn’t hungry by this point and my dinner party had already all finished! I was so flabbergasted at what she’d said I was laughing! It was taken off the bill but there were so many other mistakes like forgotten rice and charging for a vodka, lime and soda even though the vodka was forgotten that it really didn’t make up for anything. We paid top dollar for unsatisfactory food and that’s putting it nicely. They were very friendly when we left. Funny that...

My friends and I ate at this restaurant last night. The food was okay and the location is excellent. What I would advise is to check where your chair is placed in the restaurant. My husband’s (77 year old) chair was placed over a section of flooring consisting of a metal grate with a moveable piece of flat iron over it. Ten minutes after sitting down the leg of his chair fell through the grate and he landed on the floor. While staff quickly came to his aid to me they were fairly blasé. This restaurant will be memorable for all the wrong reasons for us
2
Haven't tasted the food yet. Still waiting... Kitchen is too slow and the staff does not keep us informed.
5
I had dinner here on Saturday night - steamed seabass with rice and stir fried veg. It was delicious and the staff were really lovely too.
I would highly recommend this place.
4
We had dinner here one night. Good Thai food. Good service. Option of inside dining with air conditioning or outside on the river. We had chicken phad thai and green curry chicken. both were good. I'd go back.
4
Sit on their outside terrace next to the river a let life pass by while
you enjoy som seriously great thai dishes. Staff friendly and serviceminded.
4
Big lovers of Thai food we couldn't resist a visit to a Thai restaurant. The restaurant had a lovely setting situated along the river in Clarke Quay the staff were friendly and attentive and the food was very good. We had satay sticks and fishcakes to start then chicken green curry and chicken massaman with steamed rice - both very tasty dishes. Like a lot of places in Clarke Quay the beer was expensive only made bearable by the buy 1 get 1 free offer
4
Great Thai Food overlooking Singapore River in Clarke Key, the restaurant has the option of air-conditioned indoor dinner or an outdoor terraced area right adjacent to the river. Pick a table right next to the river. The staff were friendly and attentive whilst the food was first class. Although the food was a bit pricy, it is located in a major tourist area so no surprise, I did think the drinks (even in happy hour) were too high as compared to other restaurants in the area (hence the loss of one star).Recommended for the quality of the food, if only the beer had been a bit cheaper
4
Went there with a team from work for a casual dinner by 18 on a Sunday. Selection criteria was ”lets pick a place with many guests” then we know its good.We picked nice starters to share (beautiful presented). Nice staff. For main course i picked sirloin steak with vegetables on hot plate, many others picked their signature phad thai - all food well made and nicely served. Two beers, starter and main course sum up to 55 SGD. Good place
5
Score a seat on the outside patio for great views of the river, and while not inexpensive I was quite happy with the food. I don't see a point to paying high prices for Pad Thai and the regular dishes, but shoot for the shrimp prepared several different ways and you won't be disappointed. Service was really good too, which is uncommon for east Asia.Note: while the renowned Singapore chili crab is offered here, it's considerably better at Jumbo Seafood across the street. Stick with other dishes
4
Visited for lunch, and utilized their lunch deal which includes soup/salad, main and drink. Service is good, and food comes fairly quickly too. Food quality is also good, the mix of spice is just right - not too spicy nor too bland. Tastes like proper Thai
3
Get a dinner there: Employees are ok, good communication, present and fast. Take a table near the river to enjoy the view.As appetiser I took a Larb Gai, very tasty but ... they forgot the mint on the side.Then I took Pla Muek Yang (BBQ Squid), I think it could be tasty, but it came mid-cold, maybe they prepared it too early ?This night was special : there was an Halloween event in Clarke Quay and a lot of people. Maybe a problem with a lot of people ? well also the price is a little too high at the end I paid nearly 50 $SIN with a beer (+1 free).I will let another chance. With mint and a hot main dishe, maybe I can give 4 stars
4
Food here was good and service was quick. All washed down watching the boat tours on Clark Quay, especially if sitting outside right next to river front
3
Stopped in for a quick late lunch. BBQ seafood platter sounded good and was good. 2 for 1 beers and service was efficient and friendly
4
Great location at Clarke Key this restaurant by the river is situated in a very vibrant location.
The food is very fresh and tasty. The staff were very helpful ant helping us choose a meal.
3
With hundreds of restaurants and bars all lined up its a daunting task to pick one along this street however since we were craving for Thai food, this one caught our eye. Good food but on the expensive side. Ordered chicken satay, pad Thai and a lemon iced tea and paid around 47$!
3
The signs say " Beer 1 for 1" and it is true, buy 1 beer and get one free. However, 1 mug of beer is $10.90 and just down the road off this tourist strip a mug of the same beer is $3.50 so you tell me is the 2nd one actually free or more expensive? Fortunately we checked before having too many! Food I have to point out was really nice

We are not often in Singapore but the first year Clarke Quay opened we there enjoying amazing food and wine. Three years ago there again, food and definetely moved to tourist fast, quality average. Tonight for us it hit rock bottom at Rennthai, we doubt if the chef had ever had a Thai meal let alone visited Thailand. The Tiger beer was good that was were it ended. Feeling like good seafood I went for the BBQ platter beautifully presented the dish held promise, the apoertiser of spring rolls where hot and freshly fried adding to may expectation. The platter contained three Satay's cold dry and rubbery, squid so tough it bounced, fish cakes, just pieces of white fish but at least hot, mussels baked In a the shell with a spicy pork mince were quite tasty, lastly tow prawns in their shells that must have sat in a tray to airdry for weeks, before being BBQ'd to hell.My wife was more fortunate her grilled chicken dish was edible, but she ordered plain rice not sticky rice and guess what turned up, sticky. The service was less than good, a waiter that didn't want to be there had no idea about customer service. I can't remember the last time I wasn't asked how my meal was, if asked I would have told them but they had no interest in customers what do ever.Needless to sa
4
I brought a work colleague here for a late lunch. For the appetizer, we had the sampler platter and then we split two mains (Pad Kra Pow and bbq squid). Everything was cooked as expected. Flavors were sport on. Service was excellent. Worth a stop if you're craving Thia food
4
We dine in at this restaurant last friday and it was amazing. We had a nice table by the river. The food is good especially their tom yum seafood. We order phad thai and curry for our main course and it is equally good. The price is quite a touristy but as expected it is in clarke quay. The Beer choices is quite limited but their promotion buy 1 get 1 free will solve it all. A bit warm temperature at outdoor seating so we sweat after eating spicy food. Overall experience ia satisfying
1
I'll keep it short. Service what mediocre at best. Patronizing questions from "you know we serve Thai food?" to "are you sure you want Thai beer?" to "another round?" when we've already answered that we're only waiting for the desert (which was long overdue) were not good. But what was borderline offensive was the food itself. Chewy, undercooked beef and worst red curry we've ever had (it wasn't spicy, it was almost as sweet as your desert). Wasted time and wasted money
2
We visited Renn Thai for dinner on 24th August and were very disappointed. The food was overpriced and the service was poor. They were running a one plus one offer on beer and after serving my husband the first beer the waiter did not bother to serve us for close to half an hour. We ordered Pad Thai which was fine but King prawns were badly overcooked. Did not expect such poor quality. The restaurant is next to the river so location is good but sadly below par in all other aspects
3
Services are good but the food did not quite meet the expectations given the restaurant's reputation. Maybe we went there with too high an expectation. Services are excellent though and the speed of serving the dishes is also good.
4
Great food by the river. Service was good and attentive in the evening. The green Thai curry with chicken was nice and spicy and full of flavour.
The scallops were delicious.
Be prepared to pay touristy prices.
1
The restaurant's food and service cannot be comparable to any restaurant. When we entered the restaurant, we were not welcomed properly. The rude waiter gave us the menu and left. Once we checked the menu, it did not have many original thai foods. We had ordered the food and drinks and nearly immediately got the drinks. I was surprised and impressed with the service, but once I drank my drink I had regretted going to this restaurant. My lime juice was sweet, while the Thai ice tea was disgusting. The waiter had said that it was normal, and were offered other drinks except for water. The satay was dry and bland and the sticky rice was just wet. Don't go to this restaurant at all
3
Situated along Clarke Quay, this restaurant used to serve good Thai food.Unfortunately on our last visit standards of both service and the food had gone down.the pineapple fried rice was dry and virtually inedible, with the other dishes not much better.Prices were high for substandard food.Maybe they had an off night, but will not repeat our visit
3
This Restaurant is situated on the Rivet Walk off River Valley Road. You have the choice of sitting inside in the cool or outside by the river.The dishes we a ordered were not as nice as we expected. The seafood rice dish had 2 prawns, a piece of rubbery squid and some purple tiny squid legs. The rest was just rice. My other half had the same dish but with beef. He got a lot of dry pieces of dull looking beef which was very chewy.I complained about the amount of sea food and the waitress asked the cook for me, but he refused. Do the waitress asked if I'd like another dish instead...which I agreed to. This time I ordered a clear noodle dish with Chicken. Again the BOILED tastless teeny weeny bits of Chicken were spars. Go else where as plenty of places to pick from in the area
3
Have to say 3 out of 4 dishes were good! I may have picked the wrong one with seafood fried rice. The rice was dry and the fish (prawn, scallops and something else chewy) was not fresh and tasted like it had been reheated. I can make much better myself.The other 3 dishes were good though so I would give it another go however there are so many other places to eat id try those first now.$96 for the meal and 2 beers (buy one get one free before 7). Equiv Â£55
3
Not the cheapest versions of Thai food in Singapore, but for a view of the busy SIngapore River with all the bumboat rides up and down, and perhaps an evening beer (watch the prices after happy hour), and some spicy Thai food. This is a restaurant to skip if you're strict on authenticity. Otherwise, go ahead. Reduce the chilli, reduce the salt, reduce the fish sauce... that's what you get at Renn Thai. Fake. Just like Thailand
4
My second visit here within the span of a month and the experience was different but good.The Good:1. My friend is vegetarian, and we decided to ask if they could do some vegetarian options for us as we really wanted to eat Thai. I was most surprised to find out that they have a separate Vegetarian menu that is quite comprehensive. It has the usual Red and Green Curries, along with some stir fries and the Mango & Papaya salads as well as Fried Rice, Noodles etc.2. The service was great. The staff is always attentive and prompt and goes out of their way to make suggestions or help in any way possible. This time, they really helped us with setting up the child seats and making things comfortable for us.3. We were delighted not just with the menu but also the food. It was so good that one of the kids who usually eats only rice, was really taken in with the Red Curry...4. The ambiance by the riverside is great... especially on a pleasant and breezy evening such as the one we visited on.The Not-so-good:1. It's hard to get seating right next to the waterfront unless you make a reservation. Even on a weekday night such as the one we visited on, it can be tough to get any seating outdoors if you just walk in.2. It's a little pricey for the same food and quality that you can get at Bali Thai.3. They tend to prefer really loud background music that interferes with conversations ... you might as well be in a bar ! But they do oblige and turn it down if you request them to.4. I haven't been pleased with their stir-fry mixed vegetables, which seems to lack flavor
4
This is a great reliable place to have Thai at Clarke Quay overlooking the river. It is inexpensive and has a number of drink offers to go with your meals: 2 for 1 or jugs of beer. If you do not like too much spicy flavour watch out for the dry chilli flakes that come with a number of the dishes (even in the chicken and cashew dish), suggest you ask for mild spices. Service was a good standard. Lovely outlook
4
If you like Thai food, Renn Thai at Clarke Quay is worth a visit. The food is quite tasty, fairly well presented, and reasonably priced. We ordered a variety of dishes for the four of us, including chicken cashew nut, grilled chicken, papaya salad, pineapple rice, and Phad Thai. Service was quick and efficient. For an even more enjoyable experience, sit at a table overlooking the river
4
Been here on last trip and was happy to return. Friendly service and good riverside location so dining alone you have plenty to see. Food was good.
5
We went in on a whim and the meals did not disappoint-satay chicken skewers, pad Thai, steamed scallops and pineapple rice.
Well worth visiting if you like Thai food.
1
Just got a microwaved meal from last day for 19++. Don't go for fried rice. Over-priced for the quality of service.
3
I felt sorry for what I think was the first day for one of the waiters. He seemed to be spinning around in circles. The food is good if overpriced and sitting next to the water on a nice night in Singapore amidst the bustle is a cozy feeling. The service was slow
4
Clarke's quay has a great choice of restaurants so I guess there is plenty of competition. We chose Renn Thai because we could sit overlooking the quay. We had Fish cakes & prawn lollipops for starters and steamed scallops and green curry for main course. They were all good but not exceptional in terms of taste or presentation. Prices were average so reasonably good value
5
This restaurant really busy. We tried to ask table by the river but it already full. We decide to sit inside with aircondition. We choose right decision. Staff really friendly. We order set of appetizer which is coming really quick. Its perfect as we are really hungry. We also order mango salad, pineapple fried rice, beef got plate and french bean with chicken. All food are delicious. My husband is an English and he is very selective choosing food, especially asian food. He said the food are delicious.Its safe for european tourist to come and have the meal here.I plan to come back to bring my families here
4
Nice location on the water with good views. Ordered the split prawns, but asked for spicy chili sauce and extra chili, together with seafood fried rice. Prawn and chili sauce were excellent, rice maybe not made to order, but its squid, scallops and prawn were good. Service was attentive. A very pleasant experience and worth a visit if you are in the area
4
Had dinner here on 30 December 2016 – very busy – very popular – sat overlooking river – couple of starters – prawn cakes – seafood platter – not served all at once – tasty well cooked and satisfied – took Amex which was a bonus – service efficient and friendly – thank yo
3
The location was great with a terrace right on the river. I was alone so to be shown to a nice table at the water's edge was very nice and the view was fantastic. The service was good and the staff attentive. The food was OK. I wish they had shelled the prawns in my Phad Thai. However for a solo dinner I would rather have OK food and a great location than the other way roun
5
Our 2nd night we decided to go for Thai food! We so love Thai food! And yet, we were not dissapointed by our choice! This cosy restaurant, next to the river of Clarke Quay serves great Thai food! The Tom Yam Kung soup is amazing! As main course we all took a curry with rice (both green and red)! Loved it!! Great staff and happy hour when we were there around 8pm
4
weekends have longer wait time. the thai soup and coconut drink is awesome. the noodles and green chili chicken is mind blowing. the service is good but sometimes it takes a long time for the waiters to serve.
5
Had a couple of entree's and a beer. Food was delicious and service was good. Down near the river overlooking the boat cruises.
5
Good Thai restaurant with a nice verity of dishes. Recommend the starter with all small dishes. For main course take a combination of dishes for the whole table. We were with 3 people.
4
Late night dinner after landing in Singapore at 10pm... fantastic padthai noodles, fishcakes and spring.rolls... food was a winnerand would go back for the food.
Service was a bit slow and the beer was warm... but findinf tjat is not unusual for Singapore
4
I fancied a Thai meal one Monday evening recently and went searching for one at the Clarke Quay. I didn't have to go far to find a nice looking place with a terrace on the water front. I tried to grab a table directly overlooking the river, but, being a single diner I didn't really stand a chance. Nothing doing. All vacant tables were reserved (apparently). Nevertheless, I got another good sized table for 4 on the terrace with enough space to spread out a bit.I ordered the draught Tiger beer, tom yum prawn soup and the Thai red beef curry with steamed rice. The waitress asked me how spicy hot I would like my food. I reassured her that I would like it Thai hot. She looked highly sceptical, even concerned warning me that the chefs in the kitchen were Thai nationals (!). So when the food arrived I did my best to keep my hot sweats down to a minimum. To give her credit she only came over once to see if I was OK...I devoured everything with relish. I love hot, spicy Thai food. And given the warm, balmy evening with the view out over to the river traffic I can count this as a lovely experience
4
The restaurant is located in Clarke quay with a nice location along the river . First dish with different Thai appetizer and as main dish Thai fried rice noodles with king prawn and chicken . Taste and quality of the food are really fine and above my expectation (Clarke quay is full of tourist... ). There is also a beer promotion : you pay first beer and the second is free.Bill is not so expensive (for sure to eat in Singapore is not so cheap....): 63sgd.I really appreciate food and both staff and location. Very good!!
3
The food was average and the service was below average. We had to keep calling for a waitperson. There was a 2 for 1 beer offer but we weren't aware of this and after we'd finished our meal and paid the bill they asked if we'd like our free glass of beer ... too late.
5
The menu lacks some of our favourite dishes and of course there was no pork, but despite that there was enough choice to make a varied meal. All of the dishes were authentic and good sized portions. Service was efficient and friendly. A fab dining experience
3
Nice food (but they could work better for the green curry as it was creamy and blend). Staff seemed to mind their own business unless they serving our table. As we ordered heaps of foods, they tried to squeeze everything on the table making dining experience quite uncomfortable. Could have provided extra space since the restaurant almost empty
5
We thought our dinner at RennThai was one of the best in our entire 3-week vacation. The waitress was helpful and clever, and to our taste the food was exquisite: seasoned correctly -- not too heavily, and not too bland -- so that the interesting flavors blended nicely and matched one another. The pad-Tai was great. So were the curry dishes. The highlight of the dinner was the platter of finger foods that we chose as a starter. We would recommend NOT to order the deep fried squid, however. it's too bland, and you can get it anywhere else -- nothing especially Thai about it. In short, a bit on the expensive side, but worth it
2
Fair, curry lacked flavor or heat even when asked for spicy. Fairly expensive considering. Location was great. Should have know when other spots around them had a 45-60 min wait and they had plenty of tables. Not recommend
4
The food was good, but however not excellent. There weren't the crub available and not signaled outside.
4
The restaurant is located like many others on the Clarke Quay waterfront. My second visit here and I enjoyed the Red Thai Curry with prawns and a squid starter over a beer. Food and service were great.
4
Must try. Various choice of meal. Great view in Clarke quay. The taste is excellent. The price around 30 SGD with a glass of chardonnay.
3
This restaurant location is great. Seating outside by the riverside, enjoying the view of moving boats and the rivers, the wind blow softly, wonderful atmosphere for dining. Then came the food. It was a beautiful arranged food on the plate. but tasteless. I love Thai food and have tried many Thai restaurants. This one is a real disappointment. No taste and price is so expensive. I guess in this restaurant, you paid for the location not the food
5
Initial greeting was not great, and Chili Mud Crab was not available, however ... once we got past all that, we settled into an excellent evening of wonderful Thai food and drinks. Sat overlooking the river as the sun set. Staff were great, really helpful. Did not rush us at all. Loved it
3
Firstly , an apology for the lateness of this review . My husband suffered an accident whilst we were in Vietnam ( after Singapore ) & that & other circumstances have meant reviews are very belated !Lovely setting beside river so always something fascinating to watch the Bum boats & other river traffic.Typical Thai food nicely presented by smiling friendly staff.Great very large glasses of Sangria!!Beware that unlike the other restaurants in the area it doesn't open until 6 p
3
It might be because Renn Thai is located at Clarke Quay by high-end touristy expansive restaurants, but I was disappointed by my dining experience at Renn Thai. Service was nice but slow, and my chicken was surprisedly tasteless and hard. It was quiet expansive. I would have paid 4 times less at any of the hawker centers for a much better experience
4
We had a great time dining on this restaurant. Staff are all friendly with good food and one for one beer promotion. A very quick action when suddenly rain pours, they move us to another table. A bit expensive maybe due to its location, a tourist place. Must try food is tom yum seafood and satay chicken. We plan to visit again once we came back to singapore
3
Not many vegetarian options, they're all practically the same it's just the type of vegetables they use that differs. Fried rice was very bland. Ordered a beancurd dish which on the menu doesn't mention any meat, came with chunks of chicken. Service for the table behind us was poor, took them 15 minutes to deliver three beers to their table yet part of their food they'd ordered had already come out.Dishes just plonked onto the table, took a while for the waitress to understand what we wanted to order.Just a whole lot of miscommunications
4
Good diner there, with tasty Thai food and the usual Clarke Quay ambiance.
Fried vegetables, green curry ... nice food, really.
Fast service, not inexpensive place (typical for SG), overall good experience.
Watch the cost of your Tiger beer, though!
3
The food was good, we were lucky to find a table by the river. The service is a bit slow. It would take ages for them to come by the table and even longer to deliver drinks.
5
On our last night in Singapore we walked from our hotel to Clarke Quay. Our choice for dinner after checking out the other restaurants was Renn Thai. The menu was interesting with different choices & seeing some of the meals being served, so fresh. The staff were very helpful with suggestions. They also consulted us as to the quality of our meals. We enjoyed the atmosphere & service from the staff as well as our meal.I would recommend Renn Thai to anyone staying in Singapore
3
~team lunch at Clarke Quay, no reservation no fuss, seated and served quickly and friendly staff~had the "Phad Woon Sen" Thai fried glass noodle with chicken, balanced yet an average meal not good not bad (see photo)can go for a quick meal but nothing specia
4
We were there midweek, seems its always busy.No tables left outside , so dined in.We ordered an appetiser plate to share [just delicious and great variety] then a chicken green curry [ order red if you don't like it spicy] ,Pineapple rice and a singha beer and a glass of Sav Blanc [ 15 sing for a small glass of average wine] but its a typical price where the wine is highly taxed.Great food, good service and about 120 Sing would seem an average bil
3
Had a meal for 2 last night and was a little dissapointed. Food was average at best. I live in Bangkok and my girlfriend is Thai so we know Thai food. Som Tum did not taste fresh but dried out by perhaps being left in a fridge too long. Massaman curry sort of ok but unlike anything I've had before. Expensive but you are paying for the location which is very nice. Staff pretty good. Yet to find a good Thai meal outside Thailand
5
One of our 1st nights in Singapore staying close by had dinner at Renn Thai, superb choice of food, friendly, gentle, staff. Drinks wonderful- Gin Sling and Daisy Gin and very reasonable, and food just superb.Came back for our last night and just as good.Excellent location, great too that you can sit inside or out, both nights we ate inside as so warm out.Would highly recommend
5
Renn Thai is always on my list of places to go for a good feed, my favourite is the chicken rice served in a hollowed out pineapple - this followed by the sticky rice really hits the spot for me.I always try to get a table right at the water - great scenery of the casino in the distance, boats travelling up and down the river!Can't beat it
4
This was a lovely restaurant with great food, sitting over the river. We visited on a Friday night about 7pm and sat outside, where it was only about 1/4 full when we arrived. The food was amazing but did find the service was a bit sow, we had to ask to place firstly our drinks order and then the food order. It took quite a while for our drinks to arrive ( a bottle of wine and water). We did find that this type of service was normal in the restaurants we visited, so could have been that we were used to a speedier service in Dubai. I would still go back as the food was great and even though a little slow the staff were very friendly
5
This restaurant is most Fantastic. Phad Thai noodlee is very best all over the world. Very nice services, and the price is Good
5
Yes probably not that authentic and maybe a little overprized but who cares when you have this view, this breeze and this food. Time on time we return to this Thai restaurant and we still love it. Make a reservation in the weekends
4
Good location, friendly staff. Chose vegetarian green curry. Was really tasty as was my husbands meat choices. Good size portions. Reasonable price
4
Setting is good for dinner. We had an enjoyable meal here. Not exceptional food but overall good value. Enough for us to return during our stay
4
If you want to drink in Singapore, you can go in Clarke Quay and find this place. The venue is cool and has a promising view of the Singapore River. Everyday, you can purchase their beer on half their price. This is a resto-bar so no need to worry if your stomach is empty. Note that this is also a tourist spot here in Singapore
2
Had a farewell meal on Friday night with friends. Friendly service. However I am a coeliac and made the waiter aware of this fact and he was very aware of the need for gluten free food. Requiring gluten free food is always an eye opener in Thai restaurants as it makes you aware of which restaurants make their pastes from scratch and made from fresh ingredients. Neither the green or red curry at this restaurant was authentic as they couldn't guarantee the paste didn't have gluten as it is brought in already made (ie in a jar). Unfortunately my night was terribly spoiled as I was told and assured three times that one of the starters was gluten free when in fact it was laden with glutenI know when I have been "glutened" and 90 minutes later became severely ill. One of the party went back to complain and to try and get my money back but it was not forthcoming. Definitely stay clear if you require gluten free food. Not a happy customer at al
3
The food was average, none of the dishes stood out for being good nor bad. There are the usual Thai dishes and some regional foods as well

Chose Renn Thai for a meal whilst visiting SIngapore with friends recently - great location at Clark Quay and food was of good quality.However , the waiter made a point of promoting the "Happy Hour" to us ( 2 beers for the price of 1 ) until midnight.What a shock when all beers we had were charged for !!! Waiter said small print was my friend and I needed to drink the same beer - never mentioned when he promoted the happy hour to us , never mentioned to us when we ordered.Untrustworthy business practice.Food was good

First trip to Singapore and our first meal. After wandering Clarke Quay for a while decided it looked as good as any other. The atmosphere is nice as we sat by the river watching the world go by. Service was friendly but distinctly average. However, I found the food good with some elements better than others. Overall a nice setting but a bit pricey for the quality of food and service provided, definitely targeted at tourists
4
A very nice Thai restaurant at Clarke Quay. Prices are very reasonable, the food is tasty, and the service is excellent.

Having been to Singapore many times, we understand that eating on the river attracts higher prices but as we had a fleeting visit were keen to be in the middle of the action. After having taken a boat to see the laser light show and fighting jet lag we were eager to have a quick meal on the river . We were attracted by the delicious menu. The place was packed and we were told we would have to sit inside by a lady who appeared to be the maître d'. When we said we would rather sit outside we were asked to wait inside at a table and when a table became free we would be moved. We were about half way through our drinks when a table became free. The maître d was extremely efficient, polite, friendly and seemed to be doing the job of about five people. She seated people, took bookings, ran drinks, took food orders and was extremely impressive. We ended up seated near the entrance and was incredibly impressed by how she handled large groups of people turning up while simultaneously handling hundreds of other requests.We had a Tom Yum Soup and the Beef Massaman. We had wanted both to come at the same time but there seemed to be some confusion so the soup came first and then the beef but we shared both. The soup was spectacular and the beef was very tasty and the size plentiful. There was a wide selection of beverages and our drinks and tap water came very quickly. This was just the meal and experience that we had wanted
5
Good selection of thai dishes alongside Clarke Quay..what more do you want? Pleasure boats floating by as the sun goes down. Busy tourist area, but not unpleasant.
4
Outside dining right on the river. Seafood platter was good but not cheap - alas Singapore is an expensive city. Very busy but service was reasonabl
5
Had amazing Thai food...not over priced and quantity is sufficient for 2 people...had chicken satay, cashew nut chicken and khao pad rice...bill approx 70 sgd...Rayzel was extremely helpful and courteous...thanks

We were staying in the nearby Novotel and found this lovely Thai eatery on our first night. They have a nice seating area overlooking the river. Menu is not hugely extensive but sufficient for us. We ate early( before 19.00) so the restaurant was quiet and service was friendly and quick! Eating before 19.00 also meant drinks at Happy Hour prices ( two for the price of one) . Our bill for two starters and two mains and four bottles of Tiger beer was 87SD inc GST and service charge ...not cheap but not outrageous. We enjoyed it so much we went back again the following night
3
We were lucky to get in pretty quickly on a Saturday night but that was the fastest anything happened while we were there. We saw our waiter plenty of times but he rarely asked if we needed anything. We ordered a veggie dish with white rice on the side and spring rolls. The veggie dish came out before anything, finally someone said 'oh did you order rice with this?' After we received everything the food was great. I would not return here because of the service.
2
Very busy hence was noisy and slow service. Food was below a average Thai quality. Nothing really to recommend about this place
5
Food, service and ambience so good, went back the next night.Great setting and views and the best meal we had in Singapore
5
Enjoyed a great meal here which was so good decided to come back the next night. Thought it would be as good but didn't expect it to be so much better. Great food choices, great location overlooking Clarke Quay.
2
Pretty mediocre quality and service, although the ambiance along the river was nice. I have had much better Thai food back in the US
2
Had dinner here a few nights ago. I accept that Clarke Quay is for tourists and is not cheap. This was definitely expensive. Two main dishes (small dishes), rice, beer and a fruit drink $100. We ordered 2 dishes and rice and normally would expect that they would served together, this was not the case. The food was ok but not up to the price. I think you could find better in Clarke Quay
4
This restaurant appealed as it had a good selection of seafood and a relaxed atmosphere. While not really Thai the dishes were well prepared and good value for this type of dinning around Clarke Quay. You could do worse.
4
Good quality food, beer price v reasonable too. $8 a beer. A good option on Clarke quay. Recommend the hot plate beef. Busy but good choice.
3
After a long day and night shopping, my wife and I needed a good feed. We decided to head to Clarke Key for dinner. We really felt like Thai and thought we would try this restaurant out. As the food came out, we were a little disappointed with the portion sizes. We found that prices were way too high for such small portions. We would expect this pricing in a more exclusive restaurant but there's nothing special about this place.At the end of the night, my wife had agonising pains in her stomach which may have come from the food! Anyway we won't come back here again. It's a one off for us. I'm sure there are better thai places in Singapore.
2
After not being able to get into our restaurant of choice and feeling quite fatigued after a hot (but enjoyable) day in Singapore, we stumbled into Rennthai. Location on Clarke Quat riverfront always good but food disappointing. The mixed starters was good and the beef massamam also good but.......the king prawns with herb butter??? 39 SGD for 2 x tough, quite tasteless king prawns. Seriously?? Pricey meal also no bathrooms..had to walk to toilet in parallel street. Left feeling we we're a bit of a case of ripped off tourists...a once off really....I wonder how how much of their patronage is the one off tourist....next time we will be better prepared
4
A good place to have dinner... Right at the rivers edge at Clarke Quay... Good choice of food & service
5
had a meal here lovely setting overlooking river in boat shaped open restarauntfood very nice and service good very busy due to setting at night all lit up quiteexpensive for a small sized meal and be aware sevice charges in singapore can be 10% plus goverment tax of 7% on top of meal price drinks again in most popular placesexpensive 10 dollars for half pint of bee
5
Stumbled upon this restaurant by accident as our first choice of restaurant was fully booked and this place was opposite. Although it was very busy, it just so happened they had a table for 4 people available next to the river. The location is fantastic, it's lovely to sit and watch the activity around the quay.Our waitress was lovely and service was quick. I have to say, Thai food is one of my favourite foods and this is one of the best Thai meals I've had. The flavours were delicious and cooked perfectly. Amongst other things, we ordered the mixed starter, satay skewers, squid, green curry, a fried rice and green vegetables.It's quite expensive but I'm always happy to pay more for good food
4
I specifically fancied a light Thai dinner and walked to the River and found RennthaiYes it was pricey but you have to take the location into account - most of the extra money goes to rent.The scallops were absolutely gorgeous and I had a stir fried vegetables to go with it. I probably wanted a bit more kick to the stir fry but added some of the chillies from the scallop dish. Both the cold served Cabernet Sauvignon and the Shiraz were a pleasure
5
We ate three times at Clarke quay and while the other two times were ok the meal we had at Renn Thai was simply excellent. I had the barbecue seafood plate and the satay sticks and my wife had the Pad Thai. Everything was very well cooked. Service was quick and they kept the beers coming. Recommend it for a group of hungry tourists.
5
The most amazing thai food! The menu is very extensive and we couldn't choose what too order. Everything looked so delicious. Eventually we ordered the seafood baked in coconut, jungle noodles and green curry with steamed rice. It was excellent! Really recommend this one. he best restaurant on clarke quay. The rest of the restaurants was not really crowded which means no good haha!Only thing I did not like was that they don't serve the food all at once. The dishes came separately to us with 5-10 minutes in between, so we could not start eating together
2
Actually the locations is not that good. All we can see are shopping malls but nothing special. The food is below average. Prawns tasted frozen and soft not tender. Tiger beer is the only thing worthwhile.
4
we dine in this restaurant as a recommendation from my father who works here in songapo, servers are great and food is awesome, gave me a flash back on all of the great food we had in thailand
3
The food was average, nothing spectacular. The waiters were not very friendly and misunderstood a few of our requests. Excellent location though.
1
go away from this restaurant
Over price ...i had a garoupa grilled.. But the fish was dead twice..and absent from my Plate. My wife took shrimps...the Plate was nothing to compare from the pictures menu..
So do not go to this restaurant
5
It was a great dinner for me and my friends. The service staff were friendly and very considerate for some of my colleagues have diet restriction. We love the black pepper and chili crab, it is a must try. Green curry chicken is equally good what we have in thailand. Its a bit pricey but worth it especially its Singapore. Definitely we will be back again when we visit Singapore.

This is my first negative review on trip advisor. We ate here our first night in Singapore and were wholeheartedly disappointed. As we walked in we heard another customer complaining and should have left there and then - more fool us! My partner ate the whole fish which was soggy and had barely any meat on it. I had a thai red curry which was quite tasty but nothing to write home about. The service was the worst part. My curry was brought out without the rice I ordered and when I told the waiter they hadn't brought my rice he proceeded to tidy another two tables up as they were trying to rush other customers in before he went to the kitchen to find out about the rice - in fact he only went once he saw me staring at him. So after almost ten minutes of waiting while my curry was going cold, and my partner had almost finished his meal my rice arrived. We then placed an order for another round of drinks.... Which never came. When I expressed my concerns to the head waiter after our meal he offered a hollow apology. I asked him if he thought the service we had recieved was worthy of the inclusive service charge but he told me there was nothing he could do about it. What a load of rubbish. And expensive rubbish at that!!Sadly because of it's location this place will always fill up with tourists like us!!
3
Clarke Quay is a great area to eat and drink. This place is right on the river so you get a breeze if there is one! Most of the other places are tucked away down laneways. Friendly staff, slow service and the food is nothing really but ordinary Thai food but well presented. Steep prices but this is Singapore. Will try another place next time
4
Went here with a business associate for dinner on a Friday evening. Clark Quay is a "hip" place and a good evening out. The food was good with strong flavours and quite well spiced. We had the grilled (bbq) fish platter which was very good. A few pitchers of beer finished us off nicely. A great place to people watch and you can go to a bar or club after. Well worth Visit for the overall experience
3
The 4 of us came here for lunch . Its located at Clark Quay, Menu looks descent. The Place is clean, the service was polite but very slow. Food not fantastic not horrible either. It might be little bit pricy but maybe cause of the locations. The beer is cold so that is good ! Will we be back? Well… maybe…. Maybe….
4
My family and I enjoyed the excellent seafood dinner at Renn Thai on Clarke Quay last week. The staff are friendly and attentive, and the service swift. Seating is tight as sardines in a tin, and we were wedged in next to an expat family whose precocious teenage-brat daughter ratchet-jawed throughout our meal in a voice like a band saw cutting through tin. Thanks to the efficient service we departed quickly, escaping the audio-onslaught. But the food, service, and general ambiance exceeded expectations
3
Nice location in Clark Quay. Good menu. No Wi Fi.
Pineapple rice does have any pineapple in it - just served in half a pineapple !
Waiting staff helpful and service good.
3
This place is awful , staff split water , lied about loo and served inedible food . Totally disgusting .
4
The usual Thai menu but with the Clark Quay as background makes it different from the other Thai restaurants! Enjoying the pad thai and mixed satay with family and friends while in Singapore. After dinner, a walk over the bridge and listening to various music proves to relax the mind while thinking on the next itinerary
4
It was worth a visit again for the 3 consecutive nights during our stay in Singapore. The Food is good and beer is place in bucket with ice to keep it cold. Staff were very polite and always smiling and attend to our needs, they might be short of hand but still good even have to wait a bit longer for another round of beer. We will come back again here if we visit singapore next year. For the price its a bit expensive because of the location, nice view by the river. Danke renntha
2
The location is great, at the heart of Clarke Quay. The menu card leaves you quite enthusiast stick end in anticipation. but I found the food quite average, especially if you know how great authentic Thai food can really be. In many ways targeting tourists and therefore overpriced with Average food. Very polite service staff thoug
3
We ate here early one evening. We were shown to a riverside table that was pleasant. We started with a BBQ Platter that was OK followed by a Green Curry and Honey and Garlic Chicken that again was OK but not outstanding. Drinks were a bit pricey but no more so than anywhere else.Strangely they have no loos here so you are directed to a public convenience down the road
4
Stopped here for light evening meal after a long day. Good prompt service despite busy restaurant.Tom Yung seafood soup to share was advertised as hot and spicy and it certainly was. We like chilli but this made our hair curl (& we had requested not too spicy after being offered the choice). Not as hot as this in UK!!BBQ platter was delicious.Squid cooked perfectly.Would return when in Singapore agai
1
The chicken stir fry is minced and cooked bone dry. The Thai beef salad is marinated in Kejap manis for weeks and then again cooked bone dry. Sweet and tough. On a few lettuce leafs with sliced onions... While I specifically asked my beef medium-rare (what was I thinking:) Come on! 24 singapore dollars per plate! Horrible food If you want a real world class Thai then Jim Thompson restaurant n Dempsey is the go! Yes we went there the next night to make good on our taste buds! Don't eat at this Renn place, - Runn away - it's got nothing to do with Thai food, nor Thai hospitality. A tourist trap. By the way, we had a table river side. The Waiter did tell us to mind our 3 year old as "last week a child climbed over the small fence and fell on the concrete slab below." Luckily not in the river as she would have drowned. Thanks for the tip, but you should fix the fence so kids can't climb so easily over it from the table chair !
3
Stopped for dinner as it was busy and seemed to have Singaporeans as well as tourists. Food was average, service was average and not particularly interested and the whole experience was more like a fast food restaurant than a dining experience. But nothing was bad either
3
Situated on Clarke Quay, Renn Thai offers indoor and outdoor seating and a wide range of Thai dishes. Unfortunately the quality of the food is average at best and whilst the atmosphere is good there are so many better alternatives for a good Thai meal in Singapore
1
Cant get anything worse than this one.. avoid at clarke quay. Long waiting and service time. If you are in the are.. find somewhere else.
2
I know this restaurant in Shanghai so I went there hoping to find the same quality. 90 dollars for a beer, some vegetables and prawns. Prawns had a terrible taste. Expensive and good, will not go back there ever again.
1
This is a Thai restaurant on Clarke Quay. It has the Clarke Quay location going for it, and the food is ok. Nothing special, but ok if you want Thai food.
4
We ate here twice on our recent visit to Singapore and they serve the best green chicken curry we have had in a long time. Friendly staff. We hit happy hour on our second visit and was offered a jug of beer for 26 S$, instead of the 31 S$ we would have paid for 2 beers, so a good deal all round
5
We were here a year ago and loved the food, so we came back this year and guess what ... the food is still great! What else is good is that the price /quality is definitely there, only alcohol is pretty expensive but that is every where in Singapore now
4
Renn Thai is situated directly at the waterfront on Clark Quay, just up from hooters.I have been here several times and the food is magnificent.Service can be a little slow, but worth the wait.I recommend the Pineapple Rice, washed down with a Singapore Sling
4
As my friend and I are avoiding human traffic for the NY eve's countdown we went to Clarke Quay for an early dinner and decided to dine in at Renn Thai...it was great that we had the river view seating...the view is relaxing...Neth the supervisor recommended the BBQ platter which we agreed to order, on top of that we had their bean string vegetable (dont know exactly the name) which is really tasty. The BBQ platter is okay, nothing great about it but the vegetable we ordered is awesome.As the night is getting busier we left the restaurant full and satisfied. Neth is very attentive to our needs and often dropsby ro our table to ensure that we are okay
4
Went for their lunchtime weekday promotion of 4 courses meal and i must say it is well worth it. Food quality is good too.We had Set B- Tom Yam Soup, Thai Fish Cake, Olive Rice, and Calamansi Drink and Set C- Tom Yam Soup, Papaya Salad, Pad Thai and Calamansi DrinkTom yam soup is rather spicy but nice... chicken is soft too.Fish cake is normal.Olive rice is yummy, my girl asked for more... they top it up with minced meat tooPapaya salad is good too, fresh green papaya with peanut topping.Pad Thai is rather good too... and they served their good with good plate presentation It is $15 nett for each set and i think it is a steal...Also i must thanks their staff for their wonderful service. It was raining when we finished and without umbrella, we couldn't get to the opposite site without getting wet. Plus we have 2 young kids with us. The staff send us over so that we won't get wet. Kudos!!
4
We did not have the same experience as many other reviewers - perhaps that is luck, but apart from an initial reluctance to bring us our drinks (first course arrived first) the service was pretty good and always polite.The food was good. Delicious satay to start tasty green (meat) curry for me, minced chicken for my wife. Oh and the Phad Thai was very good indeed.Location plays a part in price, but Clarke Quay is a fun place to be on a Friday, even if only to observe the fools doing the reverse bungee jumping!!Perfectly acceptable meal for us
3
I ate at Renn Thai on a Thursday evening. The food was decent but the staff left much to be desired. It took over five minutes to be greeted once we were seated. Then, we never saw our server again until she brought our bill. Others delivered our food and drink orders.This is one restaurant I won't be returning to when I'm back in Singapore
3
...nothing Special. It was OK but you pay for the location not for extraordinary food. I guess it could me mixed up with any others of the Restaurants in the area, nothing that you really keep in mind.
3
Expected more of Thai food in Singapore but this lacked the tastiness of the usual Thai fare. Disappointing.
4
The settings is great - right along the river you can see in both directions, see the Singapore Flyer lit at night and the boats going up and down Singapore river with their lights.The food was decent - great taste and presentation for Thai food. I enjoyed the lassi style drink, Thai seafood curry in a coconut and glass noodles. More than enough for one person to enjoy. Seating is a little crowded and close but overall the experience is enjoyable. Service was a bit slow - after taking my table took 20 minutes to get my order placed (I was dining alone). The food arrived rather quickly but at the end of my meal it took another 20-25 minutes to get my check after requesting it
3
Right on Clarke Quay with outdoor seating beside the river. Great location!Service needs some work - it took 45 minutes before our full order was taken and another 30 minutes for the food to arriveOne the food arrived all was good. The Green Chicken Curry was absolutely fantastic! Great blend of spices with loads of chicken. Make sure to order some rice as well to sop up all the curry sauce. Finish it off with the Mango & Rice -- fantastic dessert
4
This restaurant is located on clarke quay, we sat in the outside area overlooking the river which was a nice and scenic.We started with the tom yum soup which was served in clay pots and was very tasty, main courses were varied and flavoursome and we enjoyed them all.The prices are higher than expected ( 40 pounds each ) but I suppose you are paying for the location..
1
First of all I have to point out that the food here is reasonably good - the variety, quality and authenticity. Very Thai.But the service is truly painful that I was a little angry when I left this place. The waitresses were serving the empty tables instead of diners. They were inviting at the entrance, but once you sit down, it is almost impossible to get their attention to take order, bills or drinks. We waited for half an hour to get the bill and two glass of cold water. Case closed.P.S. really not advisable for special occasion to have frustration in the end, unless you are extremely patient
2
A very disappointing evening spent with three friends.Lack of customer service skills evident with staff when issues raised could not handle or deal with guests concernsOne annoying thing is Why do they insist on bringing main course items before the appetiser's??A very mediocre sampling in such a lovely location, Overall very poor and overpricedAidan Donegal Irelan
2
Living in Singapore I occasionally go to visit places and restaurants dedicated mostly to tourists, just to see how's the service and is Singapore showing its true F&B face. In most of the cases I'm annoyed by the choice, the menu and the service. So this time the Renn Thai was no different. The waiters are not sure what it's served in and with the dishes. The food is overpriced and prepared to fit the foreigners taste. Considering that this restaurant is located in the mid restaurant hub, the Clark's, and facing the riverside, the selection of Thai dishes, the impression and the atmosphere is poor and not authentic. Overall, I'm not recommending this place. Spend the same money for much better experience elsewhere.
4
This is a sister restaurant to the Bayang Balinese Restaurant, and is part of the same company group. It has a very similar menu, with some purely Thai exceptions. It is just as good as the other one, price wise it is very similar, the service and food were excellent on the night attended. Not the cheapest place at Clarke Quay, but well worth a visit for a view of the river whilst dining. Recommended
3
We ate here after checking out the Clarke quay offerings. The menu was good and the quality of the food was very good too. Service is all a bit hyper and over happy to have you in for dinner. The fake US accents could be dropped!! The mixed starter and drinks came very quickly although the food is brought out by a bloke who doesn't seem to want to serve tables or speak. One of our dishes was given to the table next to us and had been stirred and sniffed before the error was realised at which point it was placed on our table!!! Still it came with an apology and was very tasty!!It's a bit pricey but that's the location. If you don't mind shabby service the meal will delight your taste buds.
1
I wish I had looked at TripAdvisor before I sat down. Title says it all. Toughest beef I have ever had. Unchewable! Everything else just deep fried anonymous "stuff". Expensive too.
5
We stopped over in singapore on our way to Bali and had a dinner here - really lovely fresh food and reasonably priced.
4
One of the best choice if you want to have a dinner with rice menu at riverside clark quay. A little bit pricey but tasted well. really enjoyed my time here with family
1
Expensive, unfriendly and tasteless !
Make your wallet a favor and go somewherelse with proper Thaï food
3
I tried this restaurant with my family. Ordering normal thai dishes such as tom yam gung, chicken basil leaves, grilled chicken, vegetables, pineapple fried rice and mango with sticky rice for dessert. The food overall is average and price is quite high. As I eat Thai food quite often. I don't think, I will be coming back again to this place.
1
Unfortunately the food here was not so good. The chicken satay was the only highlight. The chicken wings were mush. The Tom yum soup was in a nice bowl but way too much chilli and lime. The service was ok but not stunning. Disappointing visit. Lucky the company was excellent
4
Visited Clarke Quay on Friday night and decided to try this restaurant. We ate outside and it was very busy as expected. Service, especially for drinks, was very slow and indifferent. We ordered jugs of Tiger beer for our party of 4, and each time it took at least 15 minutes for the order to arrive. We even had to engage other servers in an attempt to find out why our simple order was taking so long. The food, however, was very good. Try the pineapple rice! Would visit again but probably not on a Fri or Sat night in an effort to get more responsive service
4
It was a good dining experience we had on our last night in Singapore. Staff are very friendly. The food is great esp the Chili Crab although its not authentic thai dish but still one of the best i ever had. We are seated at al fresco area and the view is great, quite hot because some of the fan is not working.

Have just arrived back in Australia after traveling to a number of countries and eating at many varying establishments from street food to fine dining. Renn Thai was by far the worst dining experience my wife and I had throughout all countries we visited,and that includes grabbing a snack at Macca's. The limited pluses were the beer was cold and setting was ok. The food was as far away from Thai food as you could get.I have been to Thailand more times than I can count, been to a Thai Cooking School for a week and count Thai food as my favorite. This was more like Chinese take away food dished up with no taste, no idea of Thai ingredients, sauces, fresh herbs or vegetables. The staff are rude and unfriendly at best with not one Thai staff member in sight. They really need a Thai chef or Someone who knows something about Thai food. The prices are ridiculous for the muck that is dished up. Honestly, avoid this place like the plague and spend your money elsewhere. I just wish I could give it negative stars. The pits!!
4
The order came wrong, the order came very late, and the corrected wrong order came waaaaay after we were done. Also, the bill was very expensive, at around $60 per person. That said, the pad thai and the green curry were absolutely excellent! For starters, the beef satay and fish cakes were good not great, the spring rolls were every good, but again the mains were excellent
3
You're really paying for the location if you eat here, which is genuinely fantastic. If you can get a table on the waterside it's a lovely peaceful place to be. The food was good but was pretty expensive for what you got.
4
We went there on our first dinner in singapore and it was fantastic
Various menus : fish , pork, beef ... With many kinds of soup
And just seated on the river bord
5
Good Thai food. I could not fault it. Service a bit slow and food came up at different times. Portions good size. Bit expensive but it's clark quay. What you expect.
3
It started out well, we were greeted enthusiastically but never saw that waitress again. The food was not great, nor was it cheap. The service was reasonably prompt but very impersonal. With so many other choices we'll vote with our feet next time and go elsewhere.
1
After going in search of some Thai food we settled on Renn Thai as the menu sounded impressive. Unfortunately this is where the good part of our experience ends. I have never known such shoddy and disorganised restaurant. After waiting 15 minutes to order a drink, the waitress would not take our food order at the same time. All of the tables around us were feeling our pain and there was a fit of giggles when the man next to us got his drink but they didn't bring his wife's. As for the food I really wouldn't bother. The starters were ok on a good day but the main courses were over priced and completely tasteless. I was asked if I could handle spice when I ordered my main but I failed to find any spice anywhere. I wouldn't have Ben able to tell you what meat it was, the rice was cold and my water was the best part of the meal. As you can imagine, they were fast at bringing the bill and they stood over us as we counted out the money. If you want to be packed in like a sardine, have shoddy service and an expensive tasteless meal then this is the place for you!
3
Renn Thai is a good restaurant that you will not regret to try. They have a good variety of food with a good quality. Their outside sitting area is not so good because there is almost no spaces between tables. Finally I would rate it as a bit expensive.
4
Weekend stay in Clarke Quay Singapore, so we booked the first night at Jumbo Seafood Riverpoint. The second night we wanted more crab so we went to Renn Thai. Their pepper crab might be better than the famed Jumbo Seafood version, but the rest of the dishes we ordered were meh at best. Since the bill comes in the form of a mortgage, I expected our other dishes to be as good as the crab. The people watching at Renn Thai is great, but other than the crab the food was just OK. Still.....I'd come back
4
Last day in Singapore, had a few hours to kill before flying home.Took a Bumboat ride and hopped off at Clarke Quay decided on Rennthai. We ordered the tasting platter, chargrilled squid and a noodle dish. Icy cold beer and wine ,good honest food, great service ,what a great way to finish off a holiday .Sydney Rick ka
2
RENN THAI is more of a tourist trap... Food is very expensive and the quantity is also not great... Taste is good and drinks are expensive.. Only good thing about Renn thai is its location by the River....Most staff dint speak English which I found very strange because I dint face language problem in any of the other restaurants in Singapore
2
We went there as it looked ok and busy, and did not check first the reviews online..our bad, as my fried chicken was really fatty and not that tasty, and the meals were over priced - we were only told after ordering that rice is not included in each dish, but was 15 dollars extra!! Would not go there again, I have much higher expectations from restaurants in Singapore
1
Over priced restaurant with very average food. Would not serve a glass of iced (tap) water despite spending over $100 on food and wine. Will never return simply because of that.
4
It's a simple Thai place where the cuisine is authentic, the service polite if a shade relaxed and the atmosphere engaging if you're visiting as a family. Located right next to the river, you get to sample the colourful atmosphere around in an unhurried fashion!
3
Very mediocre food, reasonable prices, Friday night was pretty busy (a lot of much less busy places around) thought it was a good indication for good food - wrong.
Menu selection was just OK.
Service was slowish.
In all, a very bland culinary experience.
3
Has a Nice location on the Singapore river, was looking for veg food and they served some veg dishes. Starter was good. The addition of a fantastic view by the river in the night made it a good experience overall..
4
My wife and I ordered for the barbecue platter and it was great! We also enjoyed that it was by Clark Quay so it was actually a great scenery facing The Central.
4
A good restaurant full of business men, good authentic Thai food. This is a busy outdoor restaurant by the river.
4
Renn Thai, very tasty food, OK service . Mid week dinner for 8 crowded and noisy but it is in centre of the Clarke quay belt. Feels a bit clinical. However the food is very tasty and prices were very reasonable eg beer $10.50 and combi platter $21 plus fees and charges about 20%. Boat quay a better feel
2
It was my first time to eat at this restaurant and everything was fine until their waiter dropped a glass of mango juice onto the marble table and broken to many pieces. Well, the juice splattered all over the table and dripped to my shirt, shoes and got pierced by a tiny pieces glass on my palm. However, I do not make any kiosk out of the situation and decided to change table. Now, the waiter wasn't panic and did not apologise immediately till we move to another table. I also notice that the supervisor did not make any extra effort for her colleague or staff incident. Nonetheless, the foods taste were not up to my expectation and it was overly priced. Considering I've been to Thailand so many times. I have paid for $113.03 for three persons and this the first and last I will visit this restaurant. If their management going to read this, personally, I'm not making any bad impression but at least care for your customer attentively. It does help your business in some way. Thank you

Although the concept of reserving a table seems to vanish once you arrived at the the place and the waiting time before getting served can be long , what matter is the food through the past year we have been to renn thai @ clarke quay more than dozen of times , we keep on coming because of the constant quality of food , we love it and kids also love it !Chicken satay, pineaple rice, king prawn in curry , are our favourite dishes Being placed next to the river is a plu

Great location, fairly good service and some of the dishes were fantastic. The coconut rice which should be a Thai staple was average, quite dry, and as some of the other reviewers have said, quite pricey for the quality of the food, but then again, you are paying for the view and location. Given the number of restaurants in the area, if they invest in better customer service, they can stand out from the rest. It was fairly good service, and I would recommend it if you are looking for a nice dinner, without quite as silly prices as most of the other restaurants in the area. It is very close to the train station, which is very convenient as well as being easy walking distance to the other lovely restaurants, shops and pubs of the area

Nice location on the Singapore river, price quite high for what it was but given location not surprising. We had pad Thai & a couple of starters. Enjoyable, nothing outstanding, wine very expensive, service average.

The service was impeccable. Food between good and average. Scenic seating along the Singapore river. You can sit both outside and inside. Try the Grill Platter - good meat as well as some seafood.

Food was enjoyable. Location a big help. Would probably go elsewhere next time because not quite charming enough.

We ordered a duck dish and some vegetarian food.
Duck dish was very very bad, couldnt even eat it. veg food was strictly okay. The pricing turned out to be super expensive.
I wouldnt go back there again.

Thai food restaurant, the best part of it is having dinner by the water, the food come second.Not that food is bad, but if you are primary looking for Thai food, go somewhere else. If you are looking to enjoy the food in a nice enviroment then come here. Getting busy at peak times

this is my first time here for dinner at riverside but i had really bad experience with them. the moment i sat on the chair i felt terribly itchy and i thought it was mosquitoe bites. until it come to the extend that i can't take it anymore coz i can feel both of my legs are covered with the bites, we requested for a seat change and when we looked closer, it got very serious then we realized it wasn't mosquito but some evil insect from the chair! having rashes all over with itchiness now. :

I had never eaten thai food before the dinner in this restaurant.I was with a group of friend and we decided to try a lot of dishes to taste different traditional specialities. I loved them even if some spicy smells and tastes are common to many dishes

Visited this place with family. The pictures of the dishes on outside of the restaurant looked definitely nice. Presentation-wise the food was nice, but definitely lower than average and almost tasteless. Price was exorbitant. When we asked for a bowl of rice with our curry, we were told we'll be charged extra. Avoid, avoid, avoid !!

I went to this restaurant by clarke quay river side with two of my friends. I ordered vegetarian phad thai and my friends seafood. I especially told the waitress that I need my phad thai without seafood and meat but more veggies and tofu. when it arrived not only did the phad thai taste poor but it had like 4 pieces of tofu and a few strips of carrot! when i called the waitress again to ask she said she ensured more veggies and tofu. i was too hungry to argue. later when my friend tried calling them for service they ignored him for a long time though they did not look busy at all. my friends also said their dishes were of poor quality
