If you want a good chicken or mutton Britain, look no further than at Northpoint Kopitiam food court. I can eat it everyday if my health permit me. It is so addititive. Overall, awesome delicious food

Excellent place for authentic Indian Cusine esp the DUM Briyanis.
The normal biryani with mutton, fish, cuttlefish or prawns is very good.
Their naans are good and top it all off with a BRU COFFEE.

Food is excellent. Recommend the chicken biryani. Service is not the warmest but the place is incredibly clean with decor

You may either opt for dine in or take out but either way the food is going to be exceptional! I have been their loyal customer getting my frequent dose of Briyani from here and also their other outlets. I do recommend having their Boneless Mutton Briyani or Curry Chicken Briyani. I enjoy their tender mutton, soaked in thick masala gravy accompanied with their light tasting chicken curry gravy. Yes, to some it might be a little pricey (say its around $8 to $10 per head on average) but everything good comes with a price!Definitely worth to pay a visit but try to avoid eating in during weekday lunch hours

Absolute soul food at affordable prices in the heartland area. Delicious Indian food. Plenty of choices for non vegetarian and vegetarian dishes alike. My recommendation is mutton biriyani and chicken dum biriyani. Dum biriyani is available on weekends. Try onion pakora and chicken 65 for starters

The restaurant is clean and tidy with quite a few staff who are helpful and friendly. I favourite dish is Onion Rava Masala Dosa and this is by far the best I've had. Sorry no photo as it didn't last on my plate long enough. It's a pancake made from semolina flour with onions in. This has potato masala filling. Served with a dale curry, coconut chutney and onion chutney. Eat eaten with fingers. Washing facilities are again clean and tidy. This was washed down with lime juice. Again my choice of drink as it's very refreshing. Cost less than S$10. If your in the area and hungry go here.
