Delicious authentic food. Very rapid service, however the restaurant itself is very hot (poor AC). The Rich Tori is particularly delicious.

One of the better ramen restaurants of Singapore, especially if you like Tsukemen dipping style ramen. The noodles were springy, light and had a nice soft texture. They went well with the dipping sauce, which wasn’t too thick and heavy. There was hot water provided to dilute the sauce, but it wasn’t needed. The portion was also quite generous and by the end of it, it was very filling, without making you feel bloated. The restaurant itself is a little cramped, but which ramen place isn’t? The service was overall good and efficient and the queue (always a good sign) moved along pretty quickly so we weren’t waiting too long. If you fancy a good quality ramen at an affordable price this is a place to check out.

We simply love the ramen, the side dishes are very very very tasty. Those little rice bowls are amazing too, i just can't get enough of this place, been here for over ten times now. you have to come here at least once in your life to eat their reasonably priced and delicious food

This is my go to ramen shop, I've been there countless times at the Holland V brunch and I always have the same thing, the Tsukemen the ramen is served separate from the sardine soup which is thicker and more concentrated than usual. after finishing all the noodle just dilute some stock (comes in a flask) into the sardine soup so satisfying. bt the way the oden is really good too

this place is rather popular, and one of the few ramen places in Holland Village. my summary:Pros:- decent ramen quality- air conditioned environment- comfortable atmosphereCons:- lousy rude service (female waitress that cannot be bothered whether we have the utensils or not; when confronted, she simply just gestured and walked away)- similar quality ramen can be found elsewhere at more affordable prices, the premium paid should make sense in either quality and/or service rendered, both were not clearly differentiatedVerdict: - with lots to try and eat around Holland Village, you are not missing out by skipping this plac

This is my go-to shop for ramen fix but each time I regret it as it is always super warm and stuffy giving me a headache after each visit (at least once a month).But the ramen is slurpy delicious! Food quality is good as I understand, Sanpoutei has been in business since 1967 so that says it all.Just hope that something can be done about the air ventilation inside this shop quickly or have hot angry diners missing out the good taste

We loved the ramen and the broth! We went there again and we were happy to be seated in a booth. Immediately, we were greeted by the unfriendly and grumpy staff. We were rather put off as we have just sat down and were looking forward to our favourite ramen. As I was undecided on what I wanted to drink, she collected all the menus grumpily and walked off, without waiting for my order. My friend thought that she was being so rude. We looked around, the restaurant was not full. Well.... Anyway, we said no more about her service. As soon as the food came, we were speechless as we ate spoon after spoon

Worth a stop for ramen fans. Their signature ramen, the Niigata Shoyu Ramen, is all I've had - so I'm reporting from a super limited sample set. I liked it. It's very rich - sardines dominate the aftertaste. So non-fish lovers, consider yourself warned. Fish lovers, rejoice. The noodles and broth were complemented with fairly standard accompaniments (two pieces of Chashu, some scallions, dried seaweed, some thick cut bamboo shoots, soft-boiled egg). The seaweed flavor was weak. This seems to be a Singapore-wide problem - so I'm hesitant to fault Sanpoutei. I did get a miserly portion of scallions, which is however the fault of Sanpoutei. Come on!i No need to scrounge. The chashu was unremarkable. Neither disappointing nor amazing. Some of the other reviewers have commented on the price/quantity ratio. I'd say that ratio is not particularly out of balance, given that a. we're in Singapore and b. It's in a good location in Holland village. Environs are nice. Lot of wood. I guess that's how things are in Niigata.

I tried the dry ramen ($16). One is supposed to dip the ramen into the thick and flavourful sardine and bonito "gravy" with chopped char sui in it. I felt that the char sui was tad too little. However, the ramen portion is bigger than usual at 1.5 X.My son ordered the miso ramen with 5 slices of char sui etc ($19.80). He likes the chewy ramen served here. On the contrary this usual 1 X serving seems a bit too small portion.It was an enjoyable meal and we will surely be back.

The restaurant is easy to find as it faces the main road. We were a party of 5 and we were seated as soon as we arrived before 6.30pm and on a Friday. The decor was truly Japanese as tables were packed with rather small stools. There were 2 rooms cordoned off for a little private dinning as well. The food was excellent. You could drink up every drop of the Niigata broth that is cooked over 6 hours. The Aburi chashu simply melts in your mouth. The ramen was handmade. The menu was interesting. The pages were in black and maroony to indicate non-spicy and spicy menu. Then there were the soupy or dried ramen. One can order a bigger portion with additional slices of chashu. We also had some appertizers like the sushi served in little weaved baskets and also the fried chicken. They were really yummy too. We had sake as well. By the time, we finished our main bowl of ramen and drank up every single drop of the soup, we were totally full! It is one of the best ramen we ever had in Singapore
