Set pretty high expectations and fortunately I was not being disappointed. Top grade seafood ranged from Tiger prawns, Salmon and Scallops were served except one of the seafood choices ran out of order. Meat (beef) wise was alright. Just head there for a seafood feast!

Tomato and tomyum broth was a little salty for steamboat but seaweed broth is good and interesting!!

Service could have been better. Location of the restaurant is alittle remote. However, food quality makes up for the shortcomings.
4
Good atmosphere and ambience of the restaurant, not much variety but quality of food was good. Would come again.

Buffet style of shabu shabu with a lot more variety of soup broth, the Japanese beef is good, preferable choice over the Auzzie Beef. Skip the chicken and scallop. Pork Belly is pretty decent too.

Quality very good for the price. Both Japanese beef have marbling and big tiger prawns and scallop. Surprise as most places are small. Quite crowded and the staffs is friendly and responsive to our order and request. We went for 1+1 buffet dinner at 6.30pm on a weekda

As half of our group can't eat much, we decided to go for the ala carte menu rather than the buffet menu. Even though the items were really fresh, the portion was really way too little for the price. We could have accepted that if the service was better but the service was really bad. Under the promotion, there was a $1 snapper plate so we ordered 2 of it. In the end it did not come. When we queried they told us it was sold out. But they did not take it out from our bill. When we informed them that the item was not served, we were informed that it was for buffet only. Contradictory response. Also, no one bothered to add soup for us and we had to ask a couple of times before the soup was refilled. And they also did not refill the ice water which was charged at $0.50 per cup. When we asked for refill, the waiter only refilled for the person who asked instead of refilling for everyone. Very poor service.

Upon arriving, manager was cold - no smile, not friendly, no enthusiasm, poor attitude. Reached at 610pm, place was only 5% filled, no queue at all, asked if we could have any of the side tables instead of table in the middle, answer was a strict "no". Asked why no, to which reply was "all reserved". ALL reserved? "Yes". No apologies, no "let me check or see what we can arange", just a convenient "no" that tells me "dont bother me and dont give me more work to do".Ordered fish head and after 15mins didn't serve us the fish head. Thought kitchen didn't get my order so ordered again. After another 10mins fish head still didnt arrive so asked waiter to which waiter said "no more". Restaurant just opened for dinner business less than half hour ago, restaurant is less than 25% filled and no more??!! I threatened and said this is not acceptable then only after complain kitchen brought out fish head for me. Ridiculous

We had a reservation from Chope which came with complimentary wine. I was not able to take alchoholic drinks so I asked whether change to something else . The waiter gave me a strict No without even asking what I wanted. For a buffet , food variety is very very limited and a lot of food on the menu are not available. They use plain water to top up soup base instead of the original soup base. When we order second round of beef , the meat quality is much worse than what was served during the first round. All the waiters seem so used to all these and never said a single sorry when our requests could not be fulfilled. The restaurant charged GST and service charge on the full original price instead of the one of one price. I will never come back again

Good quality of food, but not worth the price of 88 per pax! some of the dishes were unavailable during my visit.
3
Food was fresh with nice ambience. However limited selection of food for buffet given the price paid.
4
Food was good. Service was quick, our orders were brought to us promptly. They didn't refill the original soup base though, just added plain chicken stock which made the soup base quite bland after a few refills
4
Quality ingredients with individual hot pots with choice of broth - restaurant is a mix of shabu-shabu and Chinese hotpot. Bill mix-up where we were charged for a few items that were never ordered, but they corrected it swiftly.
3
Atmosphere was not bad. Meats were good. However, not much choice and variety. For the price, would not go again

The restaurant has many type of sauce that you have to mix yourself. This confused me a bit as I'm not familiar with the selections.
The A5 beef didn't turn out as good as I expected. I assume buffet would be a better choice.

There were 3 of us and we ordered a platter for 1 each. I had the garlic chicken platter for 1 and there was a nice variety of meat, vegetables, mushrooms, noodles. There was also a wide selection of soup base. The tomato soup was refreshing, but the miso and konbu seaweed soup bases were a little too salty

One of the restaurants I love most in Emporium Shokuhin. Being a Shabu Shabu restaurant, Tsukeru serve fresh ingredients for the heartwarming meal. Their buffet spread has an array of dishes available, a good spread of condiments and desserts. The thing I love about their soup base is they have a selection of Asian and Japanese soup base, which cater to all kinds of taste buds. From flavourful tomato base to the seaweed soup base, everyone can have the soup of their own liking. This place is great for families, kids and practically everyone

Set in Marina Square, we tried this place because my wife had never had Shabu Shabu, and because the price was reasonable by Singapore standards. Set lunch allows choice of soup stock and choice of protein with plenty of accompaniments for the meal. Soup pot at table with burner that warms up rapidly and yields cooked food quickly. Not gourmet, but very good. Staff was very friendly and allowed us to taste some of the soup stocks before ordering so we could select one we preferred. Would dine here again.

A quiet restaurant with excellent food and service. I believe it was quiet because of its poor location and definitely not because of the restaurant's offering. They had six stock options and our party of 12 chose various stocks of which everyone of us were happy with our choices. Everything were very fresh with loads of vegetables, seafood, and Wakyu beef. Great value and nothing was too much effort. We all agreed that it was great value and most of us were too full to have our desserts, which was included in the deal. It just goes to show how great the Shabu Shabu was!! Highly recommended!
