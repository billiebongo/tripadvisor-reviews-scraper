Super quick, tasty and good value. Tiny place with attentive service. Minced meat and egg plant noodles have well seasoned soya sauce meat, far better than expected by price tag. Bit hidden away with not terrific atmosphere.

Exquisite, soul food, high quality at a low cost. From first approach it looks like a fast food place but trust the chef, the food is delicious and tastes home made.

I stayed this June at the Orchard Hotel in Singapore. In this hotel they have a real gem and that is Noodles. If you love noodles it is the place to go

Convenient , quick , inexpensive and very tasty, what more does one need. Nothing fancy about Noodles.

Good noodle dishes but limited variety and choice. Tried here for lunch once but for what we were served it was quite expensive.

I have stayed one time in the Orchard Htl in Sin_because normally we Always stayed in the Hilton on Orchard road_The Noodles restaurant is a good example of a typical Asean restaurant in a fine deluxe hotel setting_it is worth a visit it and Scotts road with all the activities is nearby_Value for mone

We stayed at the Orchard Hotel and decided to try the Noodle bar. I ordered the Shrimp Noodles and my mum ordered the chicken noodles. I loved mine, it was full of flavour and a decent size bowl, my mum didn't like hers and the waiter was great helping her choose something else with no issues. We ordered a glass of wine which was more than our food. Mid range range for the location. Service was great and food arrived quickl

I find this a really good place to go when you want something that will warm you up physically and emotionally. I would highly recommend the dumpling noodles. The restaurant is small with one waiter, and can seat about 20 people at most, but, in my experience, is never really busy. If you want you can watch the chef hand making the noodles, which is a really interesting process. The restaurant is on Orchard road, so it can be paired with a good long shopping trip. The food is really fantastic, really filling, and local. It is one of the cleanest noodle places here in Singapore, and I would highly recommend

We were staying in the Orchard, so decided to try the in house Noodle bar. We had been there several years ago, and it was good. We all had different dishes ( there were 5 of us). Everyone enjoyed their meals except me. I had the beef brisket and I wouldn't recommend it, but everyone else loved theirs, hence the high score. Service was good
3
Many noodle dishes to choose from but a bit too "soupy" for my taste and a bit bland overall. However they did have so many choices so perhaps it was just the dish I selected. Service in general was a bit slow, took 10 minutes just to get a menu and it was mid afternoon and not busy

My favorite go-to place for noodles, especially if you're staying at the Orchard Hotel, where it is located. I could always count on my noodles and wonton soup for lunch or even for a late dinner. Soups are good and inexpensive for Singapore.

Service good, noodles good, surrounding very good. Good value for a hotel-located restaurant.Add ons of dumplings also good, but no problem if you just want a drink, or dumplings.
4
They make their own noodles fresh, and you can see the Chef make them. The menu is mostly broth style, but the food we had was delicious. Restaurant is very clean and staff helpful with choices.

Had a nice meal of home made noodles. Very tasty and plenty of them. Service was great and friendly and part of our hotel which was great

The selection of Noodles (both dry and soups) is average and you can choose this restaurant, located in the Orchard Hotel ground floor, for a quick dinner.The service is fast and the dishes are well cooked, at least the ones I tried.Price is on the low side - at least for Singapore standards

staying at orchard hotel, the small area at side of main restaurant is noodle bar it is cheap and very good, we watched the chef make our noodles from scratch good to watch, dumplings in bowl soup with prawns was yummy you can get cheaper if you want to go for a walk but we where happy to stay close to home

Located in Orchard Hotel, Noodles was surprisingly pleasant. It is a small noodle bar with a limited range. While a tad more expensive than noodles at singapore food courts, the noodles were fresh and delicious. It was good that I ate there twice after a busy work day. Service was prompt and polite
3
The prices at Noodles are decent for its quality and also considering the fact that it's located in a 4-5 star hotel. The freshly made noodle (la mian) is tasty but tend to stick together and is abit difficult to separate. I love the broth/soup that come with the noodles - very flavorful and yummy. Service is fast. The menu offering is limited but adequate. This little eatery is ok if all you're expecting is a quick meal of noodles
2
The noodles are OK, but not good enough (and the menu is way too short; plus they only have one kind of noodles - lan mian) for non-Orchard hotel guests to venture in. The small indoor eating area is in a hidden corner of the hotel lobby and has zero atmosphere (unless you want to slurp noodle soup in the heat on the outdoors terrace). May be convenient for hotel guests who just want a quick meal. But then you can have the same-quality (or better) noodles, more variety, at a lower price by walking one block east, at the Food Republic (under Isetan) or the Food Opera (@ ION Orchard) food courts

Being in Singapore, you can get any of the noodle dishes they serve in Noodles in any food court in larger portions and about a half or a third of the price. There are really only 6-7 main noodle dishes on the menu and ok, you can pick one of the 3-4 noodles that go inside. But there is nothing spectacular about the place. On a busy weekend it seemed that less than a third of the few tables were taken, so there is little throughput which could have an impact on freshness and quality. Bottom line: if you happen to be there and don't want to look for the next food court, stay. Otherwise just walk this 10 minutes or take a cab and go for the bigger, juicer, fresher and more cost effective.....noodle dishes. (BTW the food court is more vibrant too
