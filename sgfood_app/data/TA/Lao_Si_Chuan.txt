Had dinner with some Taiwanese friends last evening at Lao Sichuan. Still one of my favourite value for money restaurants. Ordered spicy crispy chicken (辣子鸡), cold spicy noodles (凉粉) and tomato omelette. Always delicious. Will be back.

Food is fine to a good price quality. Worth a visit for a quick dinner, if one stays in the Mosque street/Chinatown area. Food is served fast. Bring some own tissues, as serviettes is a scarcity.

Good food from the Shu Xiang Kitchen, For very reasonable prices. Feels like a family run place. Very happy here.

Business-like but friendly service. Good menu variety. Close by for those staying at nearby COO Boutique Hostel.

By far the tastiest mala food you’d get in the (relatively) Central part of Singapore. They’ve just moved into the lobby of the Link Hotel, with two rather 80s styled private rooms. 水煮鱼 (fish cooked in mala broth) is a must have but ask to forgo the “noodles” that bulks up the dish but really is tasteless crap. For the lead tongues out there, go for the absolute max 变态 level of spiciness. A small serving will set you back at $30.Save the broth for a second time meal; store in fridge, reheat with some chicken stock and your own ingredients (fish slices, straw mushrooms and whit radish). Makes for a comforting meal on a rainy cool evening meal.

There's many sichuan restaurant in spore however this is my all time favourite. Their cooking are consistent and in my opinion they have the best La Zi Ji in town. Food portion is quite big too.Do note they are no longer located along the shop houses at Outram Road but just moved to the back at Link Hotel. Bigger restaurant now

Recently relocated to around the corner by Link Hotel, LSC is now much larger and in a more comfortable environment.For most dishes, you can set your own spicy level and be ready for serious heat. Besides the spicy chicken and spicy fish, I enjoy the non-spicy dumplings here

It only opens in the evening till late night. The chefs and staff are from China and it operates like many restaurants in China. The spicy frogs and chicken are quite authentic but the "water-cooked fish" is a let down as the fish used are different. They may want to try using live cat fish like most places in China.The live prawns are nice as the chefs are honest in giving the exact portion according to the weight requested. For uninitiated, it will take at least two visits to get used to the more oily and spicy treatment like many mainland Chinese restaurants

I went there expecting very spicy si chuan style food and found the food not very spicy(kind of disappointing if you expect furious level spicy was). Tried sliced pork with chilies(good), deep fried duck with yam(very heavy), eggplant (good), and fried potatoes. They had Lao te beer, which is quite the same beers you can find in Asia lager style. Actually goes well with spicy food. Foods in general ok and staff didn't speak English very much but they tried hard to help us. Overall ok but don't feel like going again.

My wife steered us in the direction of Lao Si Chuan because of some recommendations from friends. I'm not particularly familiar with Sichuan style food. This style generally blended spicy peppers, leeks/garlic, and meat in a really intense, really tasty way. This food is, to be sure, heavy. There is a lot of oil involved. It's offset by the chili peppers. But afterwards it seems likely that one will feel a bit lethargic from the food...Of the four dishes we tried, two were excellent and two were forgettable. The two that stood out were the eggplant with garlic sauce in claypot and the Sichuan style slice pork in spicy sauce. Both are as described. And I would strongly recommend both to anyone who goes there. The eggplant was almost like a stew with lettuce, garlic, leeks or scallions, and the garlic itself (and of course oil...). A well done blend of a classic combination. The pork was a bit more special. More than anything else, there were leeks there. Which gave it a really powerful flavor that blended the pork belly with the chili swell. I believe both those dishes were marked with two chilies. Sichuan food is ostensibly really spicy. Either they saw me (a Caucasian) and toned it down without asking or this restaurant has just decided to moderate things as part of their business model. But I wasn't overwhelmed (at no point was I cooling my mouth by gulping water or beer - although at toward the end both my wife and I were sweating a bit). On the basis of someone else's tripadvisor recommendation, we tried the stir-fried shredded potato with chili padi. This was underwhelming. The potatoes were not browned in the oil so they still retained a lot of their original moisture (I was expecting something like a latke i guess). Aside from that, there wasn't a lot going on with the dish. We also tried the "speciality" dish deep fried duck with yam. I was expecting duck with yam. But really this was sort of like a puréed version of the turnip cakes one can get at dim sum - with a sliver of duck involved. I wouldn't get either of these again. They have a 4 for 3 deal with big bottles of Laote, a regional Chinese beer. Why not?Overall. Worth the trip. Excellent looking menu and I hope to try some of the other specialities like "hand grip pork" and the chicken with chili pepper - which most people there seemed to be ordering, so presumably that is a signature dish.

Overall food and ambience is great. But make sure to ask how much grams they are giving you for seafood, so you don't get surprised of the bill. Must always double check with the waiter how much is the serving.

I ordered spicy eggplant and rice and it was delicious! Nice staff and food was served promptly in this family oriented restaurant.

We walked by the restaurant during an evening stroll in Tiong Bahru. We were attracted to the Sichuan menu - and loved it! We were a bit early and did not know that we had entered a restaurant that's very popular with locals - proof that it's good. It filled up very quickly after 7 pm. It's a very simple Chinese restaurant, with much better value for money than most restaurants that are in the middle of China Town, so go that little further down Outram Road (maybe in combination with exploring the lovely Tiong Bahru neighbourhood). Menus are mainly in Chinese, but there are enough pictures to point your way through to some great food even if you're Mandarin illiterate. Service is OK considering the simplicity of the restaurant. Warning to the uninitiated: Sichuan dishes are spicy. You can ask for less spicy - which is still quite spicy for many, so only go if you can handle a certain amount of chilli. Also, expect oily dishes. Have some Tsingtao beer to flush down the oil

Did I wake up to know I was going to be eating frogs and snakes that day? No. Did I think it would be one heck of a meal to cherish till the end of time? Yes. Let me rewind. We were meeting this friend of my husband in Singapore. This friend turned out to be a food lover and a local who knew about hole-in-the-wall places serving mind-blowing food in Singapore’s alleyways. Would you believe my sheer dumb luck? I nodded like mad at the mention of spicy food, and probably with a slight hint of caution, nodded some more at the mention of frog legs. Entrusting the well being of our taste buds upon him, we headed out to Lao Sichuan at the relatively ungodly hour of 1.30AM.Lao Sichuan restaurant is famous (read notorious) for its extravagantly flavorsome, inhumanely spicy dishes. With red furniture, cushioned sofas, and remnants of the Christmas décor hanging here and there, the ambience was of a modest dining spot, giving away not much clue on the cuisine it serves. The server spoke chinese and if we didn’t have our Chinese-speaking friend with us, we would have had to resort to the sign language. The iPad menu was detailed and included English (hurray!) along with the pictures of the dish (whoop whoop!).A quick exchange between the server and our friend enabled us to take a walk into the pantry where in a tub sat the frogs croaking about. It was not the best feeling knowing couple of these were going to end up in our plate in a short while, but seeing them fresh and feisty in the kitchen was an experience. Let me tell you about our order. Spicy frog in Sichuan style (ordered the very spicy way), Snake head sliced fish in hot & spicy sauce, Sichuan style sliced pork in spicy sauce and Stir fried shredded potato with chili padi. Yes, I realize that’s a lot of chilli and spicy in one line. The first to arrive was the Snake head sliced fish in hot & spicy sauce.The “water cooked fish” dish looked dangerous with a truck load of red chillies and Sichuan peppercorns dotting the entire surface of the bowl. The ladle comes up with the chilly oil infused broth, fragrant sliced fish and oodles of soybean sprouts. If you have been bred Sichuan from anywhere else other than where the cuisine is originally from, understand that you have been living a lie. Be prepared for an assault on your senses. With the first spoonful of the curry, all those doodles and animations on breathing out fire and shooting smoke from the ears suddenly made sense. THIS was the real deal. Minimum artificial sauces. Maximum powerful chopped chilies. Need I say that the rest is history?Despite ordering the medium spicy version, the dish was SPICY even by a South-Indian standard. We thought we were the undefeatable ones when it comes to spicy food. But this was beyond all that. WAY BEYOND. So much for our severely misplaced notions!The Sichuan style sliced pork in spicy sauce caused eruptions of appreciation from our friends, so we could easily judge the dish was an above average beauty. It looked gloriously infused with chilly oil and the vegetables seemed to be drenched in all sorts of sautéed flavors, making it almost impossible to dig in!Spice level was a 6/10 for this dish.The heat got turned up by a zillion notches as the Spicy frog in Sichuan sauce was brought in. We have nobody to blame but our selves, as we had arrogantly ordered the very spicy version of the dish. Look here to see what the dish looked like!This was intimidation of the finest order. Our friend explained the battle strategy: Scoop out only the meat, avoid the Sichuan peppercorns and pass the chillies as if our life depended on it!It was a mind-blowing dish. I cannot begin to put the spiciness of this dish into words. The oil, the chillies, the meat– it was a parade of spices. The peppercorns numbed my tongue even as the chillies performed masochistic things to my palate. We were using up the tissues fast – our noses were sniffing, eyes were watering and the ears were screaming. And YET, we COULD NOT STOP! So enrapturing was the gravy, that despite the inexplicable heat, we were tempted to take some more till all the meat was consumed. It is STRONGLY advised to stay away from the Very Spicy version unless you know what the deal is. Amateurs and soft-tongued diners, please stick to the non-spicy (no, not even medium spicy), to build a base before you venture into the wilderness! All said and done, WHAT A DISH!Amongst the entire hullabaloo, one dish remained to give our tattered tongues some comfort. The stir fried shredded potato with chilly padi was not considered much while ordering. It was after all “just a side”. But how wonderful a simple potato can taste when simply shredded and tossed with some chillies (hardly a surprise now). It’s spice level was quite very low as compared to the other deadly dishes, and hence provided us with much reprieve as we struggled to soothe our senses from the heat. Completely recommendable for its raw flavors and healthy crunch!Lao Sichuan will not be kind to your sensitive palates. If you are touchy about shocking your tummy with the real flavors of Sichuan cuisine, it is recommendable to steer clear. The food is “amazing” in one word, “insanely spicy” in two and “Can’t stop eating!” in three. That should give you a fair idea!

I came to this restaurant which is in china town. The food is great and is usually crowded especially weekend. My favorite is the chili oil fish fillet , fried preserve meat with vegetables, fried potato shreds, small dragon prawns, onion cake etc. nearest mrt station is Chinatown at the door step of the restauran

This was our second visit to the 268 Middle and store and On both occasions the dishes were outstanding. The ribs are more-ish, served in authentic Sichuan spices, we've tried both the chilli and salt egg butter crab, both are nice both the latter is just divine. The duck breast and yam us unusual and although initially I wasn't keen, I'm hooked now!Service is a bit fragmented, our first visit was quiet and we were well looked after, last night was busier and there were three serving staff, it seemed as though only one, Kshing who is great, was run ragged.Great food, tasty, reasonably priced - the crab, duck and ribs inc a large beer and coke was SGD 80

This restaurant is very simple and small and when you dine there the feeling is like you are eating in China.However, I find that the chicken soup is very thick and taste good with a litte herb but I personally feel is slightly salty.We ordered drunken prawn, beef, pork belly & mutton with some vegetables & tou fu. The total bill came up to abt $90 which is inclusive of drinks for 3 pax which I find it very reasonably priced. The drunken prawn is superb with the wine and tasted really sweet and fresh after just dipping for awhile in the hot pot. The meat also tasted good with the sauces or just dipped into the mala soup.Overall, I find the food is good and price is reasonable as compared to other Si Chuan hot pot restaurant except that you must be prepared that the ambience will not as good as the high end restaurant

I've lived long enough in Asia to know there is nothing species about this. Everything was just average. None of the special touches of Sichuan flavors. Beef is old, soup in runny, and vegetables could have been from a can. A big mistake. I should have checked it out first.

Average at best. Szechuan chicken not too spicy and had a little Szechuan “zing”, but otherwise uninspired. Simple décor, indifferent service. Slightly overpriced for what you get, $20 p/p for app and main course.Not horrible, I assume/hope there are better places for Szechuan food in Singapore. Won’t come back any time soon
