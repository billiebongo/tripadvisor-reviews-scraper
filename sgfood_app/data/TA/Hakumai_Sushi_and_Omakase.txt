Fantastic food and very friendly service .
Really really really Good. Seriously, it was ones of their best

The Omakase course was fantastic! Each dish is served only after you're done with the current one. Ambience is decent and the staff are quite friendly and attentive. The restaurant has limited seats so it's best to call and book in advance.

I love Japanese food, I travel to Japan often, this place serve good quality Japanese cuisine. Staff are friendly. I enjoy my dinner there. Will visit again whenever I got a chance.

I went to this Japanese restaurant because I keen to eat Omakase and celebrate my birthday. I ordered Sushi Omakase, the food was awesome. The sushi literally melt in your mount. Definitely recommended!
5
Thank you hubby for bringing me to my first Omakase experience! :) We were warmly welcomed by the stuff with high service level. The chef was also quite humourous and attentive to us. We were pleasantly surprised by all the dishes served! Superb high food quality. I must comment that all dishes were good but the one that struck me the most is Baby abalone with truffle butter sauce. Amazing!!! Super highly recommended!
5
We had dinner at the counter and the Chef prepared for us what he wanted. It was a great experience. Very high quality and special dishes including the fish liver. Booking is recommended since the place is pretty small and always full. I will come back
5
With the family all coming back from Hong Kong & Australia, son’s birthday and Christmas can be celebrated all together. I chose Hakumai because of a past experience. The boss and chef kept us enthralled with his skill and knowledge in omakase dining. The dishes were so fresh and they kept coming at a pace that encouraged exciting conversations. A most wonderful and exquisite experience

Suppose if you work in Tanjong Pagar area near international plaza and don’t wanna walk further for Japanese food. Then this is for you. I met a friend there for lunch. I must say I’m not impressed. For the quality, portion and price, there’s better value out there. It’s nearly $70 for 2 persons set lunch including taxes. And we already ordered something modest. Mentaiko grilled salmon set. The Taste is ok. I mean, it’s a Mentaiko mayo sauce smoldered over a piece of salmon and grilled. It’s not haute cuisine. The waiting time took awhile too. Well, they said need time to grill... the whole atmosphere was like a small dark dingy izakaya feel. And service staff so-so. There are many Japanese chain stores serving up similar food for less price and better value. Would I be back? I would have to say, no. No push factor. Especially since so many new Japanese food outlets popping up around Tanjong Pagar area. Don’t need to go here at all!

We originally wanted to go to another sushi restaurant near by but unfortunately they were closed today. Checking TripAdvisor we decided to try Hakumai. Boy we were wrong. The omakase price was whopping 168++ sgd/person, same price as you would pay at top quality Ginza Style edomae sushi set. Naturally we expected a similar quality.First thing we noticed are pre-pealed shrimps and prawns. Yellow signal right there. The wasabi was also a powdered kind, at which the chef explained that the fresh kinds are too expensive. (ok).Overall ingredients are not fresh, especially the raw oyster and grilled shishamo which have very strong smell. Other dishes also have odd combinations almost like a chinese fusion. Sushi also have some odd jumps, such as kanpachi, straight to otoro, then aburi salmon. Mentaiko sauce with scallop doesnt go well together, then boton shrip with foie gras (not the best combination either).At most this meal should cause no more than 60 sgd top. I would kindly advise the owner Gary (if you are reading), to please either reduce the prices significantly or improve at least the quality of the ingredients significantly. Another sushi restaurant in the same building (namely Kan Sushi) can serve much better meal with fresh wasabi for half of your price. Thus you should have no excuses.Will not be back here again in the near future unless some significant improvements are noticeable.

great food... Omakase quality is fantastic.. Although some might complain about the price, but frankly, pricing is much cheaper than other Omakase restaurants for that kind of qualityIf Omakase is not your cup of tea.. the menu items are as good..definitely will not regret going ther
4
Food was good but restaurant is a bit small and cramp. Prices was slightly high but the quality of food was really good. Need to book as restaurant gets crowded during lunch hour. One of the good Japanese restaurants in the Tanjong Pagar area.
4
The experience in this exclusive Omakase restaurant was very good. Food was very fresh and some creative innovative dishes from Chef Gary was worth savouring.
4
Not the cheapest sushi place in town, but one of the best we have tried. Very high quality in fish and the experience was very relaxed and honest. Highly recommended
5
I was introduced to this place by a Singaporean who had lived in Japan himself. The owner and chef Gary clearly met the high expectations. We had a great dinner and the only thing I was missing is the opportunity to enjoy this level of Japanese food back in my hometown in Munich, Germany ;-

Was looking for a new place for an omakase meal with a dear friend & decided to try Hakumai due to the good online reviews. The restaurant's location was a bit hard to find as it was at a corner of the building, amidst other stalls which were closed past 7pm. As what some reviewers mentioned, it's a small restaurant which has several tables as you walk in & the sushi counter is at the far end which seats about 10. Only those ordering the omakase meal can sit at the counter. Not a place to impress a date but cosy enough for a catch-up with a few friends. They close quite early before 10, so best to go earlier if you would like to spend more time.Most of the courses in the omakase meal was good but special mention goes to the sashimi & sushi which were excellent. Overall, it was a good meal & chef Gary was very friendly, explaining the various courses as they were served. It's not the best omakase that I've eaten but still satisfying for the price point (we paid close to $400 for two omakase meals, with 1 beer). I found out that they have a sushi omakase so I will definitely go back for that.
2
We tried this place based on many positive reviews, but left rather disappointed. We ordered two of the bento meals and more than half of the food went back. The set was supposed to include salad and instead we were given edamame. The fish was not good sushi quality either. Would not come here again
5
We went 4 guys and set on the bar with Gary the chef. Gary has a very unique sense of humor that elevates the meal. We ate for 2 hours and every dish was better than its former. Every thing is just fresh and testes like havean on a plate. The different courses are very special and unique. Service is excellent and the atmosphere is absolutely fantastic. It is the best Japanese food I ate outside of Japan, and I eat a lot of Japanese food. Don't consider to go, you must eat there at least once. And after you will eat there you will want to come back.
5
Hakumai serves spectacular dishes with perfect seasoning and freshness. I had appetisers, sashimi, sushi and teapot soup and they are all absolutely amazing. Every mouth of food deserves praises. The head chef is very friendly and gave great recommendations. The service is great. Without a doubt, 5 stars for food and service! I would definitely be back and recommend this awesome place
5
What else can I say...the food there is simply AMAZING! For a real taste of Japan with much lower prices than comparable restaurants in Singapore, Hakumai is the place to go!Their omakase is absolutely delicious, Chef Gary's mantra when serving food to customers are "Quality food, Quantity to fill the stomach and Reasonable prices" and boy did he live up to those words! I feel like I need to elaborate more on the reasonable prices portion. To be precise the price of the Omakase there is not exactly cheap and can be rather steep at close to $200/pax for their premium menu. BUT you have to consider the fact that you will be getting top dollar dishes made with the freshest ingredients sourced from Japan itself! The dishes just kept getting better and better with each subsequent plate and it all culminated in the best nigiri aburi sushi I have ever had the pleasure of trying! Furthermore the omakase menu there is comparable to what you would be getting at other top sushi restaurants such as Aoki but with cheaper prices..The icing on the cake would be the extremely warm and approacable personality of Chef Gary who would make you feel welcome to eat at his establishmentEvery dish in the omakase is prepared right in front of you and the Head Chef Gary and his assistant chefs do their best to explain what the dish is and where do they source the ingredients from
5
selected the place from other tripadvisor scores and blogs.for the category of price, one of my best experience in Singapore. extensive menu, i had a bento with Sashimi, fish and lamb which was excellent. other original things to check a la carte still for further visits.definitively worh the visit for the quality of sashimi.service is efficient and the waitress was carefully explaining the menu option for those (us) not familiar with Japanese term
5
Well taken care by Gary! remarkable experience! The foods were chosen with utmost interest and are innovative. Love the whole experience!
5
Although I haven't been able to visit as often as I would like. The consistency value and quality of Hakumai's Omakase always never fail to disappoint. My BFF and I absolutely love it. A must visit if you enjoy a well executed Omakase.
5
Best Japanese restaurant you can find in Singapore. Been here a few times and this is definitely a much better choice as compared with Shinji or Hashida. Chef Gary will make you feel welcome whenever you are here for his specialty omakase meal!
3
Kinda disappointed with the omakase' total 6 small dishes but it's not very filling, I would consider it is kinda pricey. The omakase is very normal and there is no surprise for me, it didn't really conquer my taste buds, unfortunately. The only food I'm more please with, is the sushi. I don't think I will go back again.
4
Lost in a shopping center I discovered an amazing offer of very fresh Sushi, Sashimi and other delicious small dishes served with passion.The room is rather basic but when you get such a quality served it becomes fast unimportant. Definitively among my top experiences worldwide for this type of food
4
So this place seems like a little of a hole in the wall. However they have very good bento sets of what seems to be very good value. The Kaiseki and omasake menu is cheaper than a lot of the fine-dining restaurants but the finesse is not the same as the fine-dining restaurants. Still good and pretty as well. I know some people who swear by this place but personally probably unlikely too back too soon as it is a bit far away from my normal routine
4
The place was booked my my client and it was a great place. The staff were friendly and attentive. There is lots to choose from. Booked in advance so we had a nice quite area.I chose the lady bento which was full of anything and everything.Great place with great foo
5
I celebrated my birthday at Hakumai after reading some good reviews about it on Yelp. I went with my wife and had the omakase at the counter. It came up to more than $200 per pax but it was really good and in my opinion well worth the money spent. Gary the owner and chef is a very friendly and chatty guy and breaks the ice easily. We all had a very hearty and delicious meal and look forward to going back again. The sushi and sashimi were excellent and fresh. We were all made to feel very comfortable after a short while at the counter. Will definitely recommend this place for good sushi and sashimi.
5
All the food served were so carefully created by Chef Gary. Everything that I tried was so delicious! The ingredients are fresh, the presentation are so unique ( and interesting), you don't know where to start ( You have to make sure to take photos of the food to reminisce the moment)! Chef Gary created dishes I never thought I would try and were surprisingly delicious. We started with a plate containing leather jacket, tatami iwashi, fugu mirin and sawagani. Interesting! The presentation is so cute (yes, that's how I describe it)! The salad containing Ice plant, fruit tomato, truffle edamame, chestnut is very fresh. My faves, of all the dishes I had that day, would be the salmon, the Truffle chawanmushi, the angel hair pasta with truffle oil, Agedashi tofu, scallops.. and of course, desserts: Musk melon, plum wine jelly, and Kyoho sorbet
5
Best in taste, ingenuity, value and entertainmentAll my friends and business clients adore this place to the point of addiction.There's a new item or 2 everytime i visit this place and Chef Gary never fails to fill you up with his omakase! Food is always fresh and prepared with tender loving care. Check out the pictures as they speak for themselves. Just abt half the pics only, thats the max i can upload
5
I have been to Hakumai a few times and Chef Gary has never disappointed us with his high standards. Food is always finely prepared & delicious, leaves you wanting to go back for more!
5
Very good value omakase served up by Head chef Gary.... Would recommend anyone to try it!! Try their signature Botan Ebi With Foie Gras Sushi!
5
This restaurant is the best omakase I've tried with reasonable price. I have been patronizing the restaurant at least once a month. Chef Gary is very humorous, he will ensure your dinner is well entertained.
4
Lunch with a business associate. Pretty tight space but food quality was good and the servers were pleasant. Pretty crowded with the lunch time crowd. Sashimi highly recommended. Fresh and reasonably priced.
5
Fresh and exquisite sashimi range, creative combinations made from the heart. Comfortable setting with a jovial master like Gary made the dinner all the more lovely. Awesome!
5
If you're looking for quality food, value for money, you have to come to gary's restaurant. This is my 3rd time here and every dish that is presented to customers is always done to perfection.We had the mini omakase because we girls arent big eaters and gary was kind enough to entertain our request. We started off with the appetisers which consisted of pufferfish. The century egg toufu is my absolute favourite. I swear this is the best one i've tasted and i have never found another one that can even compare to the taste of this. You have to try it for yourself. The grilled fish was very fresh too! Thereafter we had the king crab drizzled with butter truffle sauce and angel hair pasta. It was so good i was so tempted to ask for more. By this time we were so full. We were so full by then we could only stomach one sushi. The sushi is beyond awesome, especially the foie gras sushi and the mentaiko scallop sushi. To end off the meal we had umeshu jelly handmade by our dear chef. He also treated us to tamago because it was my friend's birthday! It was really really good! Super satisfying meal!
5
I was back at Hakumai (name means white rice in Japanese) with friends after a long absence. We had Omakase on a weekend night and sat at the spacious counter watching chef Gary Ng preparing the food and being entertained by him. It's the best Omakase I had in a long time, comparable to Japan standards yet less pricey compared to other similar Singapore restaurants. Loved everything, including the appetizer of deep fried small crabs, baby squids and fish roe, the sashimi, a whole sea urchin, small abalone, grilled sweet fish, 8 sushi pieces, clear soup and ice cream. It was very filling. The Omakase alone costs S$188 excluding sake but was totally worth it given the quality. Their imports from Japan arrive every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday mornings, so it's best to dine there on those days if you are particular about freshness. Service is efficient and friendly. I plan to return more often.
5
I have been in this restaurant twice and both the times I really enjoyed the dinner.We asked for the Omakase of the chef and All the plates were amazing.The restaurant is of course expensive but such a good quality can't be cheap.Will be back for sure

Situated in International Plaza, this omakase sushi joint was a nice find. I ordered the sukiyaki set, while my friend orders her regular sashimi and tempura set.The food arrived fairly quickly, and the staff make sure that they pay attention to their diners while they make their rounds (it's not a small place anyway). My sukiyaki beef was really beautifully done. Well-marbled beef is sliced nice and thin, and you're recommended to cook it in the table-top hotpot before dipping it into a side bowl of beaten egg. I switched out the rice for udon at an additional charge of $6, and while the udon had a firm and springy texture, the soup was mild to the point of borderlining on bland. In contrast, the soup base used in the hotpot was - in my personal tastes - a bit too salty. I suppose that's why the rice is there in the set.The set comes with three thick slices of salmon sashimi, a side of fruit and chawanmushi with truffle sauce. The chawanmushi was fine, though I didn't see any need for the truffle because it neither enhanced the dish nor the meal as a whole. But if you're a truffle fan, you'll like the subtle infusion of the flavour into a classic Japanese side dish.The ambience is dark, and quiet so you can have yourself a nice cosy dinner with a friend or two. It's not a big establishment - more like a hole in the wall type of set up, but it's a great stop for anyone in the CBD who wants a comforting Japanese dinner at affordable prices
5
We spent an evening eating the menu B containing a number of dishes. While the appetiser was a little weak and left us a little perplexed the rest of the dished were fantastic with great fish and nice preparations - the angel hair with truffles is to die for. The best japanese food I had outside Japan. Service was extremely fast but respected when we asked for a break before desserts, which was needed. The environment in the restaurant is not that beautiful but as soon as you taste the food you forget it.It seems to be freeflowing tea throughout the dinner. We did not understand that before ordering additional drinks, may be good to know for future guests.
5
Superb fresh produce from japan, enhanced with sheer culinary skilled Chef Gary. Hakumai is the right place to go whenever I want to eat quality sushi & sashimi, This is the example of genre which Is delicious yet delicate and I'm very impressed with.
4
If you're a fan of truffle in Japanese food then you will like this place. My favorite was the truffle infused angle hair pasta. You can do takeout too.
5
I always have my comfort Omakase in Hakumai. Gary is not a Japanese but he makes extraordinary aburi sushi. I hate sushi only sashimi but I am a convert coz of Gary. My friends enjoyed the meal too. never did I feel ripped off which I love that
5
With a great variety of Japanese delights to choose from you are spoiled for choice. I have tried most of the set menu, the food presented was exactly same as what was shown on the menu. Certainly value for money. Highly recommend the Truffle Angel Hair Pasta
5
Ever since I was introduced to Hakumai, it has been the go-to place whenever I need to satisfy my sushi cravings. To me, sushi is all about the rice (not that the fish is not important, as any good Japanese restaurant here will have access to fresh fish from Japan). It takes many years to master the art of making good sushi rice and I must say Chef Gary's sushi rice is one of the best I've ever had!My personal favourites are Hotate with Mentai dressing, Engawa (Flounder fin), Botan Ebi Foieras and of course, O-Toro! The cooked food is very good too! Try the Baby Abalone and Scallops, Angel Hair Pasta! Normally, I'll leave it to Chef Gary to decide what to serve. Good thing here is you can always tell him your budget for the meal and he'll prepare accordingly.You can't compare the prices here to those conveyor sushi belt restaurants as it is of totally different quality. But if you take the full Omakase dinner here, I would say the difference is about 30-40% off compared to some high end over-rated Japanese restaurants. It's a very complete dining experience and I would recommend it!This is definitely a place that I will keep coming back for more...
5
This is the place to be if you want good food and friendly service. Chef Gary's creativity in his omakase never fails to surprise his customers and you can be assured he will serve you what's in season in Japan. My favourite is eating uni right off the shell!
5
This is my 7th return! chef Gary's gregarious chatter and culinary creation has again met my Japanese culinary craving. Having brought my Japanese foodies and good buddies, we all miss the beautiful chutoro and ottoro that we have consumed a few moons ago. Simple fare, Japanese aesthetics, freshness of fish, and best nigatta rice. Big big flavors that lingers way beyond the weeks that followed. I do recommend the omakase and kaiseki to start. True discerning Japanese fans will not want to miss this. If u've been around the market long enough, you can't get this quality for that price point, but that's beside the point. Do have to book in advance if u want to seat near the counter (where the action is!!!) Planning my next visit soon....try it for ur next adventure. Eat well
5
I'm owner of Japanese restaurant out of Singapore. Usually,when i stop by Singapore,I try to several good japanese restaurants .I stop by first time there and check what kinds of rice they use for sushi.Hakumai use nice Nikata rice.I talked master chef "Mr.Gary" a lot.He say "He cook with hearts".I'm very impressed and I order his Omakase.Very good and very fair price compare to another over priced japanese restaurant in Singapore. I was one of the best sushi experiences and the best in Singapore. The Omakase are value for money with your business partner !!!
4
Do remember to call and make reservations before your visit as the place can be quite crowded on certain nights. We've tried both the omakase and ala carte meals. If you are feeling hungry and rich, do go for the omakase. It is really quite worth it since there are many fresh sashimi and neverending servings of different dishes. But on days when you are not so hungry you can try the ala carte menu which is also good. Try the grilled leather jacket fish. Nice finger food! I find the truffle oil chawanmushi a bit too much though. Gary and his staff are very friendly and the service is good. The restaurant is housed in International Plaza, which is just outside Tanjong Pagar MRT station
4
Hakumai Sushi is known for its affordable 'Omakase' (especially if you can't get a seat at Teppei). That being said, the $68 meal is not truly an Omakase experience - its more a nicely put together premium Japanese set meal. You will be offered a seat at the sushi bar if you choose to spend upwards of $150 for their real Omakase meal. We really liked the $68 set - the Aburi sushi course was definitely the highlight - really enjoyed the torched foie gras on prawn and the fatty salmon. Also enjoyed the salt grilled snapper head and century egg and roe tofu. The truffle Chawamushi was unfortunately a little of a let down
4
Worthwhile visit ! We ordered the Hokkaido sushi set and there is a good variety of sushi for us to try. The serving is sufficient for 3 adults ...
5
Hakumai has the best sashimi and rice! Every visit here is a satisfying experience for my tummy! Have been here countless times and will continue to recommend the restaurant to my friends... Great service from the staff and very friendly Chef!
5
Great sushi!!! One of THE BEST sushi I have ever tryed! It is so good you do not use soya sauce! World class and higley recommend!
4
Went to have the Kaiseki meal with the hubby as I had just gotten my AWS ($138 per pax). I requested for the bar seat because that's where I can ask the chef about the food he has prepared. Needless to say, his airflown food were in tip top freshness and the flavours were bold as he has a penchant for experimenting with the fresh produce (his signature smoky foie gras with the sweet ebi sushi!!!) Best of all, he is super generous with his portions! The topping on the sushi was so long that it's impossible to finish it in one mouthful! I later found out from the cashier that he usually only allow Omakase customers to sit at the bar. Overall, thumbs up for the food and service! Going back there again to try his Omakase definitely!
5
The staff there were all warm & welcoming. I'm not really into jap food, but must say the food there is delicious. I love the truffle-chawanmushi, the fusion blends well together. Sashimi served was very fresh & the chef, Gary, was very friendly and knows his food well. Reservation is advisable as is usually crowded
5
Reasonably priced for such good food and wonderful service makes Hakumai the best, and competitors are left trailing behind. Fresh sashimi, creative dishes.. not forgetting Chef Gary's creation of Chawanmushi - fusion mix of truffle oil brings the dish up to a whole new level.Do check out this restaurant for Jap food, no regrets
5
I've been to Hakumai a few times and every visit is a pleasant one. The omakase is a must try! Chef Gary takes pride in his work and every dish served is of good quality. Do try the prawn with foie gra sushi and truffle chawanmushi. I have never seen other jap restaurants serving such creative dishes.Thumbs up for Chef Gary! If you're on a budget, the bento sets are really affordable and delicious as well. I enjoyed both the omakase and bento sets from Hakumai and I'll definitely be back for more. The place tends to be crowded even during weekend dinner so reservation is advisable.^.
4
 I love the chef's specialty- sushi with prawn and goose liver. The omakase is value for money and the quality of the food served is good. The chef is a a comedian and is creative in trying new dishes. Will be my place to cure my craving for sushi.
5
Hakumai is the best Sushi bar with reasonable price in Singapore. I visited the bar every week when I lived in Singapore. Gary, the Sushi chef, likes the Japan very much and knows how to entertain the customers very well. He serves not only Sushi but Sashimi beautifully.There are so many Sushi bars in Singapore. Some of them serve omakase course with SGD200-400. It is exobitant price considering the chefs' skill. It is better to visit Hakumai 2-3 times intead of having sushi once served by the low quality chefs.I recommend that you go to Hakumai often and can be the regular customer. Gary serves the special and wonderful sushi and sashimi. Please enjoy them at the counter

We came here because of the good reviews on TripAdvisor. Honestly, I'm totally disappointed. 1) I ordered a Chirashi Kaisen Don. They put pink fish floss (Sakura denbu) which is sweet and taste like kids meal. It totally spoilt my appetite! This is not a dish to be creative with! Other outrageous ingredients were pickles with artificial coloring (tsukemono) and Crabsticks! No self respecting Japanese sushi chef would dare put Crabsticks with Fresh sashimi!! 2) Prawn head soup! But no taste of the prawn head. They must have been to the other famous sushi restaurant and saw the prawn head in the soup. Hey genius, they actually boil a soup stock with the prawn head, not as a decoration. Also, you don't need to put a whole egg in the soup, just a little. It taste like bad chinese soup! 3) Chawanmushi does not go with truffle oil. Or whatever smart idea you think you have. I'm a big fan of fusion food. But it takes talent and good taste to invent. You guys should learn how to cook first
5
My wife and I stopped by for a nice lunch given the proximity to our hotel. We were pleasantly surprised to one of the best Omakase meals we had. Next time we're in Singapore we will go again. Yummy!
5
Great quality Japanese food tucked at the corner of International Plaza. I had Advocado Salmon Don set lunch and the food is delicious. Fresh Salmon sashimi. Will visit again!
5
Excellent & value for money sashimi & sushi. Very consistent in quality . Gary the main chef is very warm, knowledgeable & personable. Have the passion!
5
They are good value for money and of high quality
I have cravings for their set meals !
Gary is such a warm personable chef !
4
Came here for lunch today and tried the Chirashi sushi set. This included a crab soup, a salad, another small side dish and a good selection of mixed fish in the chirashi bowl. Quality of the fish was generally very good with the exception of the mackerel which perhaps wasn't so fresh, certainly it tasted too fishy for my liking. Price was a little expensive at $47 all in. Service was average but the restaurant was totally full and it was fortunate that we had made a reservation
4
After walking around the Bay area we were quite hungry and decided to go for a late lunch. We checked TA and decided to take a taxi to the International Bld. We arrived at 'Hakumai' shortly after 14:00 - and so we were the only guests after the office crowd left.We ordered 2 set menus - and we haven't been disappointed. 'Hakumai' offers japanese food on the more traditional way - as we like it. The fish was fresh and the rice/fish ratio correct. Also the other dishes were very tasty, incl. the Soba noodles - which I love. On the end we paid below SIN$ 80 - which is totally okay for the amount and quality offered
4
The wife ate here last week with her bff and was so happy with it that she's here again this week - this time with me. Their menu consists of either omakase, kaiseki or bento sets. The wife ordered the lady bento set and I ordered the chirashi sushi. We both loved our dishes which also came with the standard salad, prawn soup and truffle chawanmushi. Will want to visit again soon to try their kaiseki sets!
2
The sushi was very average. Had the special for $68 per person. Sushi didn't taste like authentic Japanese - tasted more like Chinese or a fusion of some sort. Very expensive for what you get. I've had the "hakumai" before at other places, and this fell well below the other places. But since this is the first time in Singapore, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt
5
Chef Gary has spent years perfecting his sushi rice, and in my opinion, has reached a standard that is amongst the top in Singapore. Warm and fresh, tasty yet not overpowering, his rice laced with the endless huge chunks of mouth watering ingredients will pleasure your taste buds to no end. From the simplest sushis like salmon belly sushi to the powerful foie gras on king prawn sushi (a hakumia special), they will all delight ur palate and send the inner foodie in you clambering back for more.. Do try his omakase, tell him if there's any type of ingredients that you do not take, for example suqid, octopus, lamb etc etc, and just sit back, relax and let him run wild. You will most certainly be delighted. A few dishes that are a MUST try:-truffle chawanmushi-truffle angel hair-foie gras king prawn sushi (best in SG)-aburi sea bream sushi (best in SG)-aburi ootoro/chewtoro sushi (BEST I have ever tried on this planet so far
5
My first meal here blew me away. For the prices they charge for Omakase, they serve a storm. I am very impressed by their high quality and freshness. You probably pay double the price for other high end Omakase restaurants. I come here to celebrate special events ever since. Kudos to Chef Gary
5
Excellent Japanese omakase at a reasonable price. Very nice and entertaining chef, Gary Ng, along with a group of fantastic service staff.. Definitely a nice place to gather with some good friends over nice food and your own BYO at no additional charge.
5
Visited this place countless times, with the girlfriend and her family, business clients, family, friends!
Consistently good food and service with a chef with a huge heart and sense of humour
Two thumbs up and a huge tummy to boot!
5
I visited Hakumai for the omasake dinner with friends. Gary, who's the owner is a very jovial guy who takes pride in the food served to customers. Each dish was so perfectly prepared and the ingredients used were also very fresh. The sashimi melts in your mouth and each piece was sliced in the perfect size in which you will be able to appreciate the sweetness and freshness of the sashimi. The sushi was also too good to be missed. I especially loved the combination of the foie gras with shrimp. This is definitely one of the most value for money omakase that i've tried
5
Decided to head back to Hakumai for their omakase lunch. It was absolutely excellent! You pay for what you get. It's the freshest and nicest cut.Brought my girlfriend along and we both enjoyed it. Chef Gary cut owner made sure it was nothing short of the best! He also allocated a counter seat for me within a 24hours turnaround despite a full turn out at the restaurant. We spent $160+ /head
5
My dear friend brought me down for a omakase experience and i'll have to say, おいしい.Chef Gary is amazing at his craft, and every piece of sushi leaves you tremendously satisfied.Tried the grilled tuna cheeks with a matching sake, OMG amazing.Every combination and pairing of raw fish with yummy niigatta rice is just breath taking.as the favours melds in your mouth, you can't help wondering how much can erupt from such simplicity.Truly a culinary experience; fresh, favourful, engaging, comforting and satisfying.Try it, i definitely found my sushi getaway

We stopped short of ordering the full omakase after the shasimi and niseke kimeidai .The slightly aburi salmon and a white fish were good but the rest of the sliced pieces were too cold and the shasimi came with a small oyster .The cooked kimeidai sauce was overly sweet and salty , so we were left wondering if it is supposed to be freshly flown in , why used so much sweet sauce and salt.Thats why we decided to ask Chef Gary to get us some sushi and a piece of uni to try on and not to leave to his team discretion.The uni was fresh but the toro and hirame below par .We stopped and had a piece of melon .The damage 160 sgd for each of us inc of service and gst

It is a small place, which was not easy to find the first time. But once you know where it is is really simple.Food is absolutely delicious, you can sit and enjoy a nice sushi or rice bowl, presentation of dishes is good.Service is very good, i would recomend it if you are visiting you will be delighted

My husband and I finally located Gary again. He has opened a Sushi, Omakase restaurant in the international Plaza. It was a little hard to find here, but our search finally paid off. Had another wonderful meal. This restaurant is reasonably priced for a good sushi bar

So this became a top 20 restaurant here out of the blue and i was intrigued. My friend made a reservation and i arrived at International Plaza on a saturday night. This being in the middle of the business district, 95% of the shops are closed and it was quite eerie. I was given a table and asked for a counter seat, alas they were all taken, and the waitress claimed they have a full house. They even turned away 1-2 patrons as wellSo there's a lot to like in their menu. They have cheap $15 sets all the way to $300 kaiseikis. But i sometimes worry about restaurants that have such a broad pricing range, as this means lack of focus . We settled for $40 sets - mini gozen and unagi gozenthey appear to have a few specialities:1. prawn soup, with the menu picture showing the prawn head that looked good. in reality, you get a meek tasting version with no prawn head2. truffle chawanmushi. again, you'd hardly taste the truffle and it seemed to be hidden in a soya sauce-like concoction3. truffle angel hair. my friend had it and said it was not bad. I didn't have that in my set so i can't commentapart from the above, my main unagi rice was average and sashimi was also averagePerhaps if i was sitting at the counter , interacting with the chef, and ordering a $100 kaiseiki menu , my experience may be better. Or maybe not. I don't understand the fuss about this plac

Went here with my bf, his choice because he digs Japanese food, the room was so Japan-ish, even all the staff were talking Cantonese (its funny though :D )after we ordered some bento and sushi, it was took us about almost 30 minutes to finally eat, too frigging long. but the food was good though so i thought that worth our 30 minutes waiting.I ordered Lady bento and my bf ordered sushi. try the shrimp soup. it was amazing

If you are looking for an exciting meal with squid roe, ice leaves, Yuzu Icecream, seared sushi, truffle roe angle hair served with no pretense, go to Hakumai. Chef Gary will not disappoint.

We have always been satisfying our Japanese food cravings at Hakumai. Chef Gary and his team never fail to surprise us with seasonal dishes of excellent quality and value, coupled with warm and friendly service.

Value for money; excellent quality & personable service. I highly recommend this place to all who loves Japanese cuisine!

I went with my sis to try out the Omakase. Chef Gary's arrangement on the food was awesome. We were very well serve by the staff. Do call in and let them know your budget for Omakase as this is what I did and the food the provided is really delicious. Just come and try and you will know the difference

I brought my mum for an Omakase lunch to celebrate her birthday. She was particularly impressed by how Chef Gary and his team presented all the dishes and quality of fresh ingredients. She cannot stop praising about how delicious the sushi were even after we left. Gary-san knew it is her birthday and gotten his staff to have a candle on her dessert.I lost count to how many times I was there. However, I never fail to leave with satisfaction and look forward to my next visit. Be sure to go there with an empty stomach and pamper yourself with the Omakase meal that will fill you up to the maximum. I guarantee you won't disappoint

Hakumai is my monthly regular hang-out with my friends. Despite coming so often, chef Gary never fails to come up with something new. Sashimi is always fresh and botan foie gras sushi is something I always look forward to. Service is always good and you always feel homely & well taken care in this small little outlet. A must visit!!

Spore family entertainment mag, 8 Days, featured Hakumai in July 2013. I mentioned it to a foodie who knows Chef Gary on the 1st name basis. We went on 10 Oct 2013. What a treat. I've since been there 4 times in 3 months. The menu changes regularly. The assorted sashimi is packed generously and always very fresh. Chef Gary gets his delivery straight from Tsukiji every Tuesdays and Fridays. Check out the house specials: botan ebi foie gras, otoro sushi, truffled angel hair, seafood truffle chawamushi. For my friend who's not fond of raw food the cooked food variety was really impressive. Gary pays attention on every aspect, food variety & freshness is a given, presentation, service. The whole experience is top grade.On my 3rd visit there, I had ala carte, Chirashi don. So generous was the portion, my client was impressed. I informed Gary of my intention to have a private meal (difficult in a small crowded restaurant) but the service by the staff was impeccable. I closed my deal that day. My 4th visit was with a couple from out of town. They are balled over. One of their tummies wasn't feeling that great so the flow of cooked food was most appreciated. The way Gary pays attention to the personal taste is most heartening. The journey to get to Hakumai cannot be easier. Take the MRT to Tanjong Pagar station. As you step off the train, look for the only elevator on the platform. Do NOT take the escalator. As the lift door opens on the ground level, you will be facing International Plaza. Walk 15m towards IP, and enter through the glass door on your left. Hakumai is the 1st sign to greet you. And so is Gary behind the counter. Gary isn't Japanese and he doesn't speak the most fluent English. If you can look beyond that, and focus on his passion for his craft, you will fall in love with Hakumai. His wait staff isn't the best troop, they speak English and Mandarin but they are attentive (not hovering) and polite. Honestly compare to the wait staff in Japan who doesn't speak much English, what's there not to like about the wait staff here.I've eaten at Kyubei, Ginza and the various overrated sushi kiosk in Tsukiji, I find the best food and experience is still at Hakumai. I'm going back for my 5th visit in 2 weeks time (Apr 2014) with my bunch of foodie friends for my birthday treat. Can't wait.I don't really know how much is an omakase set, I believe I always exceed the number of servings compared to the regular patrons. I'd say I pay around $140-$160 before tax per pax each visit

Hakumai is an excellent restaurant and my best Japanese dining experience. The menu is very refreshing. The freshest ingredients are used and the sashimi just melts in your mouth. The sushi is so well made that even though I am not a fan of rice, I wouldn't mind finishing a whole sushi set. To top of the excellent food, Chef Gary and his team's friendly and warm service will no doubt make you feel right at home.Their omakase and bento sets are good value for money that will make you keep wanting to go back for more (as I have). A must try

I cannot recollect how many times I have tucked away with my friends, colleagues and family members in this little Japanese restaurant in most unassuming corner in town! Never for once Gary has disappointed me or people whom I've introduced;)Gary always keep his standards high, providing the freshest and seasonal picks in town. He is attentive to his customers preferences and choices, and exceeding them every time. He makes you feel at ease, pampering you with every single dish prepared with passion. I love the variety, from the seasonal picks he will surprise me each visit ... From the juiciest sweet jap corn to baby eel to fresh oyster! Try his in-house secret dish - angel hair pasta and flounder with seaweed. Absolutely mouth watering. Pamper yourself by indulging in a fabulous meal with Gary
