We only had the buffet breakfast which had a good variety of food on offer from western to Asian. The staff were helpful and courteous.
4
Went there coz of the 1 for 1.
Also for the curry, rojak, kueh paitee and durian desserts. It was comfortable and totally worth it.
4
Not a lot of varieties, but every single dish is good!
They accommodate to your requests and food are topped up promptly.
5
Had lunch in Dec last year. Affordable buffet with multiple selection! Love the big juicy oysters and various durian desserts! First time and definately more visits to come. Thank you to all service staffs and chefs especially Chef Bernard for the great service and food!!!
5
One of the few restaurants that always serve food with great taste! I have visited it many times, and every single one of those I have never left the restaurant unsatisfied. I highly recommend the Durian desserts!
4
We book through Chope and had our lunch here on a weekday on 28th Dec'17.
Very reasonable price, spread was good of cold seafood, sashimi, local delights, Laksa was really good and spread of dessert.
Durian pengat was awesome.
Beef were overdone.
Service was great.
4
Local cuisine with limited choices as compared to other hotels buffet. Worth it if there is discount. Drinks such as bandung and teh tarik provided. Desserts are not bad as they have kuehs, cakes, durian Desserts, ice cream, bur bur cha cha Bing su. They have oyster and king crab leg available as well. Not to mention Rojak and kueh pai tee
4
The restaurant‚Äôs promotion of 50% off on their buffet meals for Seniors is a good draw and affordable to retirees. Food variety and selections also add to the choice of finally settling on it for a bonding meal with family. Loved the laksa here for its texture and flavour. Better than most places offering the dish. The do-it-yourself rojak platter and kueh pie tee round up the experience, not forgetting its dessert station with its mind boggling durian desserts. Don‚Äôt forget its sushi bar, cold section nor its cooked main dishes. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Must try while promotion is ongoing

Found out about Straits Cafe from a Facebook post and saw their dinner price of 58++ on 29th December and I decided to try out. My friends and I enjoyed the food offered by Straits Cafe. I don't take Durian but I tried Straits Cafe Durian slice cake and I personally love it. Worth every penny spent.
4
Good spread of food. Most of the food are delicious. Enough variety to satisfy the tummy of most big eaters. There are Japanese sushi and sashimi, good local hot dishes, and Christmas roasted turkey and honey ham. The service is good. Not too crowded and value for money
3
An average makan place; food variety not much; clear plates fast; limited seafood; did not replenish fast enough
4
Nice food and good place to catch up
Service staff are very friendly and helpful and logcake is awesome
1
Chope does not prompt you if there is no hi-tea. Was suprise there is no hi-tea on 23rd Dec. I made reservation 3 weeks before the said day. When I turned up at 230pm, was told we only have half hour for buffet lunch.
5
Fantastic spread of fresh seafood and many other varieties. Service is excellent. Perfect environment for gatherings of friends and families.
5
Half lobster tail, excellent noodles in a lightly spice broth. Straits Cafe is known for their
brunch and dinner buffets, but the Laska is wonderful!
4
We pass by Straits Cafe every Sunday after church and we have dined there a few times before. With the current 50% discount for seniors every day, including weekends, my wife and I decided to have our lunch there last week. We were pleasantly surprised at the spread of the buffet with very fresh Alaskan King crab claws, fresh prawns, "kueh pieti" and the well known must try Nonya Laksa, The staff were very friendly, especially, William! We strongly recommend Seniors to this restaurant for their Nonya food and attractive price !!
3
Though small variety, it was a good enough festive dinner buffet. Seafood items were fresh, nice pastries especially the durian pengat, roast turkey n beef were overdone though, nice that a few non-alcoholic beverages were included.Not so nice however was a waitress dropping a couple plastic big bowls on my foot and not apologising. In fact, she actually giggled about the incident with another passing staff. Very odd behavior.
1
Used to be so much better.Limited food selection with very very small quantity. Oyster and snow crab are mutually exclusive so you won't see them together on the buffet table. Plus it took them 20 to 30 mins to replenish and each time only 20 to 30 pieces so it's gone in less than 3mins! What is worse is that they only serve one type of sashimi (salmon) and it's hidden behind two large cooker, give a blink and you will miss it.You have to be fast and sharp to dine here. Service of their staff is the only saving grace other than that I will not go back there again.
5
The spread of local food was good. Loved the Laksa and Black Pepper cray fish. Rojak was good too.  They served one of the best durian desserts in a hotel buffet setting. Especially love the Durian fudge cake , Durian puff and Durian . Must go place for Durian lover
4
Despite some of the mediocre reviews I can't say I agree with some of them. The buffet style restaurant offers a wide variety of dishes so there's plenty of choice and the staff very helpful if you're not sure of any unfamiliar dishes. I usually make a dash for the satay section and with chicken, beef or lamb to choose from freshly cooked - it really was lovely. The problem with buffet is that there IS so much to choose and normally I make a pig of myself just trying everything from curries to Japanese ..... As for desserts well you can opt for a variety of ice creams or why not try the Malay and other delicious treats plus I do like their banana fritter
3
Not all the dishes are nice. The Rojak and kueh pie ti was really disappointing. Usually these items are not difficult to master.
Thumbs up for the very lovely sashimi and the laksa
5
Haven't had buffet lunch at hotel for a long while after few bad experiences. After reading rave reviews for Straits Cafe, indeed as true as said. Food was üëç and worth every penny. Will return again soon!
4
So far so good for the food quality-Quite a variety of spread. I have visited many years ago. The Laksa is still my favorite but durian pastries.. not really maintained the same standard.
5
The variety of foods were awesome, foods were topped up quickly once it was empty. The services provided were excellent and swift! Travelling to the location is convenient and the walking distance isn't far from the MRT as well.
5
Food was good and buffet has quite a good variety. Food was promptly replaced once it was getting low. Very good service staff as well.
5
Always wanted to come here and finally did when I saw a 1for1 special. Thanks Sham for the excellent service. Will be back!
4
The food was overall acceptable but some of the cooked dishes was cold. Hence, kinda disappointed. But the Laksa & Durian Dessert was good! However, based on the variety, it is slightly expensive. However, it was a good experience.
5
Have enjoyed the service n food served for dinner buffet. and will always come again next few rounds. Family-Friendly
2
i'm revisiting straits cafe after not having been there for quite some years.. in all honesty, the only food that was great was the laska and durian dessert.. apart from that the rest of the hot food served are cold that does not satisfy, which we wonder why is this so.
4
The dinner buffet has a plethora of seafood! I particular like the crayfish cooked in chilli crab sauce as well as the clams soaked in salted egg sauce! the cooked food was surprisingly good and special! I like the laksa, fish soup noodle as well as san mee! The raw oysters and crab was good too! Dessert was mostly durian.
4
Service was very good as staff were very attentive and cleared plates promptly
They were very polite and friendly
4
We had a nice lunch here, exceeded my expectations. Prices were a little high though considering it is a casual dining venue. Staff were friendly and attentive.
5
Dear Who may concern,
I find that the sashimi not very fresh or is it because its been defroze so there some different of the taste.
4
Booked with Chope coupons. The buffet choices is a bit limited but sufficient for lunch. The cold plates of seafoods were quite fresh. Hot dishes were not that good, beef and lamb were too dry. Laksa was very good but not impress with the noodles.
4
Thank you for the Chope to let me have a great time with my girlfriend for the dinner time. It is quite and nice location.

The Straits Cafe is one (if not the only one) of the few eateries in Singapore that shows appreciation for Seniors (60yrs and above) by offering 50% discount off their Buffets everyday. Current pricing before discount are: Weekday Lunch Buffet Mon-Sat at $42++ , Sunday Brunch at $48++, Dinner Mon-Thu at $50++ and Fri-Sun at $58++. We had Buffet Lunch on Wed 23 Aug 2017 after discount was less than $25 per Senior. There was a good spread of local and international dishes. Outstanding dish was definitely the Laksa, the broth was thick and flavourful. Unusual among the seafood on ice was the Gong Gong, which we have not eaten in years. The crabs were meaty with roe, the mussels and prawns were fat and fresh. Among the hot dishes on that day, the Beef stew, the Lamb masala and Herbal prawns were tender and tasty. Even though we wanted to try and taste a little of everything, there was such a wide variety that we could not do it. Outstanding amongst the desserts were the Durian based desserts, Durian Fudge Cake, Durian Pengat and Durian Tart. Service was very good and attentive.despite the fact that on that day there was a seminar group having lunch as well and the Cafe was filled up. Staff made us Seniors feel very welcomed and invited us to come again. We had a great time and stayed at the Cafe slowly enjoying our food from 12:00 till 2:30 pm. One thing to note is that the cost of parking your car at the Hotel carpark is very costly. Our 21/2 hrs parking cost us $11.50. The carpark spaces is also limited and very narrow, so it is advisable to take public transport or park elsewhere as complimentary parking is not available for diners. Overall, we would like to thank Straits Cafe Management for providing Seniors with this generous 50% discount for such a great spread of food. Highly recommended for Seniors seeking a good meal

This very generous and varied buffet is delicious! There were two kinds of soup, plenty of shellfish, and Japanese style entrees. Some of the main courses were crayfish; other fish cooked on request; beef rendang; an Indian curry; coq au vin. The desserts included unusual flavours of ice cream: coconut, black sesame, yam, green tea. The yam ice cream was made in-house and was my favourite. Black rice in a thin sweet juice drizzled with coconut milk, various small Durian cakes and coconut delicacies; Tiramisu; fresh fruit. Everything I tried was delicious. Iced lemon tea is included in the price.The service was faultless - so efficient, thoughtful and friendly. There was nothing we didn't like
1
Had a buffet dinner on 24 August 2017. When I first got into the restaurant, an Indian waiter asked me a very rude question, if I can afford to eat there, I was shocked by his remark. Got my food, next noticed they don't clear the empty plates after customers eaten. Noticed one french lady customer even got to stack the plates away and put them aside due the service were busy chatting away and didn't clear the empty plates. Same for mine too, got to asked the service staff to clear then they do. This evening, the restaurant is only 20% filled, the service staff say they have only 2 assistants. Having say that, that's still a lousy excuse for bad service. To be honest, the service staffs prior the renovation was good but now the services is lousy. This was one of those restaurants which I regularly ate (prior the renovation) but after this evening's experience, I really am hesitant if I ever want to eat at Straits Cafe again.
5
I was staying in the hotel on business and returning late one evening i thought I would try the restaurant. The lady asked if i fancied the $25buffet and it looked great. I started with oysters, prawns, sushi and crab claws, delicious! Then i tries a bit of 3dishes, a red chicken marinated in lots of spice and hot paste, fish curry and duck. At that point the delightful chef Nigel, came over and asked if he might make me some traditional carrot cake...a savoury delicacy of prawn, turnip paste, peanut and chilli, gorgeous! Then he made me some type of mushroom omelette. Before i knew it i was presented with a bowl of coconut broth, prawn, noodles, squid and lots of fabulous chilli. Nigel sought me out at breakfast and was so thoughtful and friendly he deserves these five stars just for him....i hope he is highly valued
5
Had my lunch here on a weekday. We walkin, full house but lucky we were early so we manage to grab a seat. For a very reasonable price, they are offering a great spread of cold seafood, sashimi, DIY popiah & Kuih pati, local hot delights, Laksa was really AWESOME and good spread of dessert. Not forgetting, it has few type of durian dessert in a chiller just for durian lovers. The cafe is running a full house and yet service was great
5
Visited Straits cafe with my family.
The food is amazing. Loads of variety.
Staffs are very friendly and welcoming.
Cleanliness is top priority.
5
went there for a lunch buffet. there wasn't a wide variety of food but every dish was delicious. everyone must tried the laksa there which i thought was the best one in my singapore trip. i had two bowls of it :D
4
We arrived at the hotel around 10pm and the caf√© was still serving and the staff provided excellent welcome to Singapore.
5
Been enjoying breakfast here with some business colleagues and I am impressed with the layout and the food and beverages available. The service has been good and the buffet selection is excellent.
4
Enjoyed the selection of cereals , eggs and bacon, could have had more fresh fruit. Overall a good cafe serving good food
5
The laksa is amazing. It's been voted the best in Singapore. Staff in the cafe are polite & friendly. They always remember my favourite breakfast order.
4
This restaurant gives a visitor a good idea of local cuisine Don't miss the peranakan Laksa
The buffet is there at breakfast/lunch/dinner The menu is also set different Morning includes a good variety of western food too
4
The Straits cafe is part of the rendezvous hotel complex, we opted for the seafood smorgasbord night and were very pleased yes it's a bit expensive (although not like Clarke Quay,) however there was an adequate supply of lobster, prawns, a variety of crabs, crabs cooked in pepper sauces and all sorts of other options, and my favourite√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ oysters which often are missing from a seafood smorgasbord were in good supply. All in all not a bad restaurant to visit for the seafood option
4
The Straits Cafe underwent renovations during my recent stay in Singapore, but they opened in time for me to see the freshened space. The restaurant is very attractive, but what is more important is that the food is varied and quite good for breakfast. There is a nice mix of Asian and Western breakfast items, fresh fruit, breads, and juices. A high point for me is the omelet station where the chefs prepare delicious omelets that do not fill your plate. They will prepare other types of eggs as well. The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you are staying at the Rendezvous, the Straits Cafe is an excellent place for breakfast
4
Just try out the buffet for the promotion from hungrygo anywhere. As mentioned their lasksa must try. The long leg crabs, black pepper carrort cake is special although I feel a bit salty. Others like prawns, chicken, duck meat, curry chicken, Japanese foods, various types of cakes, especially their durian cakes must try.Their service also not bad, in time to clear off your empty plates. If they can increase a bit of Chinese good, like roasted pork meat, fired rice it bee hoon, will be good.Overall, worth to try
3
It was getting close to 10pm after all our sightseeing. I chose the Carbonara and Hubby had Prawn with hokkein noodles which he thoroughtly enjoyed. The soft drinks were vry expensive at $6.50each.
4
so many choices for breakfast when we went there. staff friendly also. breakfast for 2 went with our room package but we were not charged, nor asked, for our little boy. maybe, because he's in the skinny side? we don't know.
3
Apparently Straits cafe is synonymous with Peranakan cusine - a blend of Malay and regional Chinese cuisine, so we came here for their buffet dinner. Yes, there was the Laksa - a spicy noodle soup but so many buffet restaurants now have that on their menu. Plenty of Japanese sushi and curries were also available but their roast was a little on the dry side. However, if you love Malaysian desserts then you'll enjoy the array of delicacies from Kuih Lapis ( a steamed nine layer rainbow cake to Seri Muka (sweet pandan custard on top of steamed glutinous rice) plus a small glass cabinet of everything durian. Service was very good although the decor a little tired - but I understand the restaurant will be closed December 2016 to January 2017 for refurbishmen
4
We had our business meeting at the Rendezvous Hotel and followed with a lunch at the Straits Caf√É¬©. The buffet spread is good and their Laksa is delicious. They have also a variety of desserts prepared with the local favorite: durian - hahaha, not for the fainthearted
3
I read several reviews of Straits cafe but I was disappointed. Breakfast food was bland. Many of the warm items were cold and I was second customer of the day. Also I question any eatery in southeast Asia without any hot sauces other than Tabasco Cheese board and fruit were the highlight. Good selection of dishes but lacking flavor. Maybe I should have ordered an omelet but I was looking for something regional. I should have left the hotel as in previous days.
5
We were a table of 13 on a Saturday evening. It was busy but not over crowded. The staff were attentive when we required more drinks and were quick to clear our plates before we went for more! There is a massive choice here. We particularly liked the seafood, sushi and desserts. If you like seafood you could probably eat your money's worth - prawns, oysters, chilli crab, snow crab etc. The roast lamb and roast vegetables were also equally delicious! Definitely need to pace yourself and have a good look around before diving in
4
Unpretentious cafe along Bras Basah Road in Rendevous Hotel that serves an excellent lobster laksa. Each bowl comes with a generous lobster claw and body with fresh cockles and fish cake. The Nasi goreng with satay was flavoursome. The Vietnamese rice rolls are among the best I've had and I would recommend this as a starter. The Ngoh Hiang was decent though I would have preferred more water chestnuts in it. Durian delights - pengat, puffs, fudge and crepes - were truly delightful. These are served in the buffet but upon request, we had a sampler dish prepared. Service was attentive and helpful though it did take 20 minutes to serve the mains.
5
I had my fill on very fresh oysters, prawns, sashimi and lots of crabs. The spread of cakes is good but I loved the durian dessert the best!There are other foods, mainly local, which are a delight but I was too stuffed to try all of them. Food is replenished regularly.The weekend buffet costs about $55 per person. They honoured our kitchenlanguage vouchers with no questions asked.There is not much of an ambience with the pedestrian walk separated by a glass wall. The car park to the hotel is a challenge to find due to road works and charges is very costly. As customers, we paid for a 'fixed price' carpark voucher at $5. The Festival in the Night was on at the nearby museum and we had a little walk after the meal knowing that carpark charges will not rack up
4
Decent spread but felt like it was not worth the price we paid.For the sashimi, we had to wait a few minutes to get served as the person was at another station serving someone else. The salmon sashimi tasted fresh.I loved their desserts, especially the durian ones! The durian tart was absolutely delicious! Their icecream had no labels though. Also, the space for walking was quite narrow, hard to walk around the food area when the place is crowded
4
I went for the weekday dinner buffet and was quite satisfied with the spread and quality. It wasn't very crowded and the cold seafood is fresh. Love the snow crab legs - you can taste the freshness and easily remove the meat from the shell. It's a pity that the sashimi was not placed together with the other seafood and I realized not many people noticed them as they were in a fridge at a corner.Another highlight will be their double-boiled soup. No msg and one would associate it with home-cooked soup.Last but not least, end the meal with their durian penyat. Very delicious and satisfying
5
A very good hotel with many attributes, Near eating places and shopping. Buses at the door. Friendly staff
4
Its a great spread of food with chinese, thai, indian varieties available.
the desert corner is also full of delicacies and lots of variety
5
They have a great buffet, tasty breakfast. My meals were included in my room rate, so I'm not sure of the buffet pricing.
4
Breakfast was included in our rate and is full buffet with a lot to choose from. Very helpful and courteous staff.
4
We where staying at the motel and on the last night we went down and had the buffet dinner. Plenty of seafood from prawn, crabs, oysters etc. Also a big variety of Asian & western dishes
4
We had breakfast here, the food was very good and the staff very attentive.
Omelettes were great and good to your liking with your choice of ingredients.
The coffee here was terrible.
3
It was late in the evening and we were hungry. Walking past this hotel, we saw some stickers promoting the cafe's award-winning laksa dish on its windows. Taking a chance, we approached the gentleman at the counter. We could see he was busy, but he immediately put what he was doing aside to attend to us and showed us to a table by the window. Well done!There were not many team members around, looking at the numerous tables left uncleared; so we helped ourselves to a menu. As we were waited for our orders to be taken, a tiny cockroach made its way to our tabletop. Needless to say, we called out to a team member when we saw him and asked for a change of tables. When he offered us the table next to where we were seated, we declined and asked for a table on the upper tier (for obvious reasons). The laska and chicken rice we ordered were cooked to perfection. A disposable bib was tied around my partner's neck to prevent unwanted splashes of gravy on his shirt. Good thinking! Despite asking for skinless chicken, the chicken was presented with its skin. But it was a small matter and I did not kick up a fuss. However, it would be great though if my request had been followed through. As I walked past the buffet spread, I noticed fruit flies buzzing about. Coupled with the cockroach incident, I would say the pesticide handlers are sorely needed.
2
Came back here for a dinner gathering tonight. Was utterly disappointed with the food - wasn't as tasty √É¬†nd I could say, quite limited range. The highly acclaimed laksa and durian spread need to be reviewed and re-awarded. Err..dessert station isn't tempting and no ice cream. Imagine. No ice cream at a buffet??!!! Well, at that hefty price (mind you, no card promo), the cafe must create an attraction and punch for repeat customers.
2
Went there with family of three on New Year Eve.$80/pax. I think there are many more and better choices at this price range.2015 New Year Eve, they served free flow snow crab legs and mudcrabs and sashimi.2016 New Year Eve, only free flow snow crab legs. They gave each pax a one time serving of half side lobster and a crab claw.Their "famous" laksa run out before 9pm.They started packing at 930pm
5
I visited Straits Cafe on 28 Dec 2015 and though the food was just above average except for the Laksa which was awesome, the service provided by Mr. Gregory was impeccable. He took the effort to remember my name and never failed to serve us with a genuine smile. Will definitely go back again and highly recommend this place who is looking for a good buffet restaurant in town! :
5
Huge variety of food, incidentally, of which little did I eat. But anyone can find enough of what they want. Service is good. Food is fine.
4
We ate breakfast here a few time on our stay at the Rendezvous Hotel when we wanted a change from the club floor. The service and food where excellent. It also seemed busy at lunch and dinner times
5
Amazing traditional Nonya Laksa - never disappoints. Great variety for breakfast, no end of variety. Love having Roti Prata for breaky
5
Good breakfast with a large spread of local and international delights. Good service with attentive staff.
4
variety of foods mostly halal food, very clean, not expensive, very close to the hotel, 24 hours service
5
Breakfast is awesome. Also you have to try their Laksa. Service is great and the staff even remembered my coffee order each day without having to ask me each time.
3
Nothing more than average for this place, quite pricey for breakfast if you stay in the Rendezvous hotel, you can get a better option for half the cost at the many places nearby, a great coffee at Delifrance or local flavores at a dim sum place..
3
Being attached to such a prestigious hotel. I think the breakfasts could have been a little better. quite a good range of hot food, but poor range of fresh fruit,, our breakfast was included with our hotel stay. A few of the staff were very friendly, but there was one who I thought was quite rude, when I told him that there were 6 of us and he said that first in best dressed. I told him that the others were meeting us at 8 and he was quite rude that we all had not come together. the restaurant was not busy so I did not see what the problem was. Maybe he got out of the wrong side of the bed. Otherwise it was quite good. the chefs were happy to cook us omellete
4
We had a buffet lunch here in one seminar I attended. The poster shown an Award Winning Laksa. So I tried it and.... agree with them. It tasted delicious and the shrimps were fresh.As it served an international buffet, so you may find any meal you like to have.Another one I love while in Singapore it is its Rojak! This mixed fresh fruits slices which you could mix and prepare your own peanut sauce is fantastic!The desserts side... they have one special fridge for durian lovers. It served durian pancakes, durian cake and puffs.I also love the bread butter pudding and some traditional cakes.Really worth my lunchtime here
3
Went on a Tuesday Lunch Buffet with few girlfriends. There's a quite good dessert spread, durian lovers might like as theres durian porridge, crepe, puffs. I like the salad station, create your own or there's nice potato, pasta salad or coleslaw. There's also self made rojak station, popiah or kueh pie tee. The laksa there is really good.Eventually from ice seafood, jap, chinese, live stations to dessert, everything was quite ok, all acceptable taste, not too heavy taste nor are the food tasteless. Don't expect very wide spread of buffet but a little of something makes me full. I am contented with the price paid. Cafe abit short handed so they are doing their best to help you clear tables. It is the snow crab legs & the tuna sashimi which are not acceptable. Snow crab is not fresh. The tuna not like what we usually have. something not right about the cut texture... maybe not tuna but I can't figure out & you will not like to have another piece of it
4
We celebrated our mum's birthday at the restaurant.
Staff are friendly and helpful.
It has quite a good spread of food catering to the family.
Most of us love the hairy crab legs.
I love their durian punnet most! yummy...yummy...
Would definitely return again.
5
for Dinner is around $60 net, less expensive than carousel @ Royal Plaza on Scott's. Love the seafood and the Durian Desser is uh-maaaaaa-ziinggg
4
I went with my wife on a Sunday lunchtime because we had been told that the Laksa was fantastic. We both ordered a small Nonya Laksa and we're not disappointed. It was delicious and very generous, with prawns, scallops and crayfish as the seafood component. I was not impressed with their so called 'whopper' fruit juice. I was expecting a very large glass and only got what looked like a regular sized glass.Apart from that I would highly recommend the laksa to anybody.
3
We had paid for the breakfast as part of our accomodation at the Rendezvous Hotel, tried it for the first couple of mornings, but pretty average really and the air-conditioning was absolutely freezing, clearly not wanting people sitting around for too long, running fans at full blast! All too much cafeteria type stuff, the Asian offerings were better than Anglo. Thankfully we upgraded to the hotels Club Lounge, certainly not as COLD and although lesser options suited us better
4
The buffet selection is not very widespread as compared to other restaurants in Singapore but every dish is of great quality. They have a few live stations where you get laksa, roti prata and Chinese soup. However the portions come rather small. Other cooked food are good as well except for the sushi part where the selection and quantity is quite limited. The servers are courteous and helpful and atmosphere is slightly noisy, well abuzz if that's a better word but the ambience is nice
5
While this restaurant is within the Rendezvous Hotel, it has become my favorite place to get away from the crowds and slow the pace of life. Seating is comfortable within the pleasant open courtyard just outside the doors to the hotel lobby, and the open white space under the Glass dome above both shelters from the frequent rains in the wet season and limits the sun's exposure year-round. While the atmosphere us fantastic, it is really the service--in particular, Rommel in the morning and Nigel in the afternoon--that has been incredible and kept me coming back. These servers and their professional colleagues provide a dining experience that, coupled with the pleasantness of the courtyard, takes one back to a time of greater civility and the enjoyment of dining. The price is higher than some of the surrounding dining options, but the experience and the staff are simply worth it
3
Visited this restaurant for a business lunch.Buffet spread included dim sum (bao and hargao (prawn dumplings)). Japanese sushi, sashimi and cold noodles, Asian dishes and a salad bar where you can also whip up your own version of rojak.Food is average.Laksa is served in small sampler portions; laksa gravy is tasty but the taupok (dried bean curd) is way too salty.Dessert is an assortment of cakes and fruits. The standard of its famous durian cake has dropped compared with previous visits.Service is excellent
3
This cafe is ok for quick meal, it has meal of most of the south east asian taste. Though the choices in each menu . The Taste of the food is ok, probably every taste has been tempered to make the flavour acceptable to international crowd. The distance between tables is very narrow, the cleanliness level is good.Overall a neat aand clean place having fresh food
2
Visited with whole family including 2 kids on New Year Eve.Price was increased due Festival period. Fair enough.Only the oysters (fresh n big), crabs(juicy meat) and durian dessert counter (the kids like it) are worth mentioning. The rest are pretty standard, nothing spectacular nothing worth mentioning.Overall judgement - other places value at same price served much better food
4
we wanted somewhere handy and no fuss for New Years Eve! a late night was not planned. this is a good location to people watch and has a laid back atmosphere! selection of food was good with plenty of crabs lobsters etc, no oysters but great scallops. the rolled ham was disappointing as was the dried sliced turkey. good but small selection of hot dishes. great dessert table. the macaroons were the best! service was efficient and friendly, wine list was adequate. not a great dining experience but a very comfortable venue for tired traveller
5
Great breakfast. Heaps of options. I had a great omelette. The had healthy options for toast and they had fruit.
5
Loved them going out of their way to cater to my gluten intolerance. Service was excellent and the staff genuinely seem to love working there. Pleasant experience overall.
4
Staff were friendly, the salad was good! Love the ah ball ling to. Friend I went with said that laksa was delicious. Place is comfortable and centrally located. A good place to be on a Friday evening
4
Tried the High Tea buffet on a Sunday and was pleased at the food offered. Mostly local cuisine. The laksa's very good, had 2 bowls of this (usually i would avoid eating this dish). The durian desserts especially the pengat was to die for.
4
I like the latte served with croissant ham cheese and muffins at good reasonable price. The environment is clean with friendly staffs
3
I tried the Laksa a d=signature dish and claimed tp be the best in Singapore.I disagree. For as special Laksa I got 2 king Prawns but I think it was over done. Simplicity is always the hallmark of good food. This laksa was not as good as the one at the Fullerton, which is my standard bearer till now.
2
I attended a workshop here in Rendevous Hotel and our lunch was served at the Straits Cafe. We had our lunch for here for two consequetive days there. The first day was excellent as there was not much people who had their lunch there. There are numerous local fares and no queue and food was readily available. We have a great lunch. The award winning laksa was one of the best that I have tasted. Our reserved table was indeed reserved. The second day was a disaster! There was a AGM by some company and by the time we went for lunch, there wasn't much food left and there was quite a queue for the prawn nboodles and laksa station.It was self service and our reserved tables for 10 was occupied by a few other strangers. Service was . non existent as the staff was unable to cope with the workload. Food was replenished at such a slow rate as the kitchen was overwhelmed by the onslaught of the group of more than 150 from the AGM which they are clearly unable to cope. My question was why was the kitchen not prepared for such a big group?I did not enjoy the lunch for the second day for obvious reasons. The service staff including the kitchen staff could managed with a smile but all that was missing, Tip: This is a place where you can go if there are no large groups for lunch and if yes, please skip this place

The date was August 10th, it was to celebrate a luncheon for my mother's 68th Birthday. For starters, it is quite difficult to get to the hotel by driving, as there are works going on around the hotel, you would have to make a big turn to get to a lane that leads you to the driveway of the hotel. best way is to take a bus as there is a bus stop right in front of the hotel.When we came to our table it was to be seated for 5 adults and 1 child, however it appeared that it was not set to our requirements, however the Outlet Manager was quick to rearrange the furniture to accommodate us.The spread is very average, nothing great that excited my palates, I can only say the saving grace was the Laksa and the Durian Pengat.The price was a little to extravagant for the sort of spread that they offered at $45 after taxes per person. It was a nice touch to have the birthday cake for my mother. I would recommend this if you are not a seasoned buffet hunter and want a little more quiet time

This is a very good breakfast buffet. There are different stations: Chinese, Indian, fruit, cereal, eggs cooked to order, yogurt, juice, breads, etc. Each station has many different choices. The quality is good and service is reasonable. Allow plant of time to enjoy and don't plan to eat for the rest of the day.

Five of us gathered at Straits last week for a reunion dinner. Years ago we all lived in Singapore, and we wanted to judge the authenticity of the Straitsfood. We were all pleased with the food but found the service to be a bit terseand rushed. We were told when we ordered that the food would arrive as the kitchen had it ready and that it would be served family style. That suitedus, but the meal was delivered even more quickly than we expected. Manypeople would find that just perfect

This is a decent buffet with an average spread. Some of its dishes such as thr laksa and durian pastry were the highlights. Try to wait for discounts.
4
Great variety of chilled cooked seafood, cooked dishes and local curried dishes (indian bread, laksa, etc). Very fresh ingredients used, evident in the chilled seafood section - crab legs, prawns, shellfish, etc.
4
i like the atmosphere and the service is good. u can take a informal meeting in here or just hang out with ur friends
5
They have the best laksa..(if you want authentic Singaporean dishes) and Bakut teh.. and the best customer service
4
Great variety of food to choose from from Japanese sushis' , Malaysian delicasies, Western food, desserts and seafoods are available. the food tastes well and price are really affordable. However in some point the place looks crowded , small space and limited seats. You can ask for crab pincher and tongs for braking crabs arms and legs. It is worth to try

I have heard so much about this cafe, chance upon a groupon discount which the cafe had tied up with. But imagine my frustration of trying to get a reservation. It's totally fully booked. In the first place if the cafe is unable to deal with the overwhelming response,they should have limited the number of discounted rates with groupon. The reservations suggested certain dates which is truly impossible as it is supposed to be our dining experience not theirs. Now I am faced with 2 useless dining coupons which I am unable to get a reservation. Talk about money making dishonest dealings. I would have given the restaurant a total zero

Price reasonable for a weekday night buffet dinner. I like the fact that they unshell the oysters only when you place the order. They were out of my fav tuna sashimi so was rather disppointed. The cold seafood spread was as usual impressive, huge prawns and crabs. Signature laksa and durian desserts was OK.On a side note, we were led to a table against the end of the restaurant where the lighting is especially poor and tables not really clean. We were promptly moved to a better table but thought they could look into improving on this

Have been going to Straits Cafe a number of time, and last Sunday will be our last ever having Hi tea Buffet in that Restaurant. Been to Straits Cafe number of time couple years back, unfortunately quality and service has drop tremendously! We were extremely surprised on how the servers and host being so unprofessional. Courteously ask for napkin, the server actually came back and threw it on the table, ask refill of ice water and he came with a jug warm water and refill a glass and walk away. How rude can that be! Didn't enjoy our afternoon High Tea at all, and we left within 1 hour. Straits Cafe was my first choice for my ROM Lunch Buffet 14 years, unfortunately the memories has turn mold

the restaurant looks tired & not up to any particular style. I think it may have had a renovation in the recent past but it was pretty ordinary.We had lunch here & the "world famous Laksa" wasn't even closeI thought it might improve for the buffet breakfast, but not so.Everything about it was average
4
...we couldn't help but try out the lunch buffet. A good decision, because we were very satisfied. They have quite a selection of food that it was hard to remember everything in detail anymore. I especially liked one dish, though, which was the baked rice with seafood. They also have a considerable selection of Durian desserts for Durian lovers out there. Food was fresh and of very good quality. I would come back, if ever I get to visit this area of Singapore again. Hmm..

Only ate here because of convenience to hotel. Choice was ok but very expensive. Had a better and cheaper meal at Dome just down the road

Rather eat at the Kopitiam next door. It is definitely not worth it for the price of $33. The variety and quality of the food is atrocious. What a disappointment to welcome us on Christmas Day. Definitely would not come to this restaurant again.
5
There is a good selection of breakfast. Have your own eggs cooked for you just the way you like them. A good selection of fruits, breads, juices, cereals as well as western and eastern foods. just loved the chicken curry!!!
3
It was not the best buffet breakfast I have ever had, but it was OK. There was a selection of western and Asian breakfast food.
5
I enjoyed the breakfast offering of varieties of local foods as well as the usual western breakfast staples - muesli, fruits, toats, cheeses, hams, etc. Being in Singapore I usually go for the local dishes - congee with fish or chicken which is delicious, selections of dim-sum which are freshly made in their own kitchen, or the eggs station serving eggs sunny-side up, or omelette of your choice, all cooked before your nose.For lunch or dinner, I love their laksa - for which they are famous for, also the seafood assortment of tiger prawns, alaska crabs, mussles and oesters. The desserts are to die-for, especially their chcomousse/cakes and local desserts

I am a fan of their award-winning slipper lobster laksa.I am a fan of their festive buffet though expensive but very well worth it with all the seafood I can eat.I am a fan of their desserts - so decadent!However, I am not a fan of their misleading chef who unfortunately mis-informed me that the salmon sashimi was 'sold out' at 7.30pm. I was aghast and had a word with the F&B manager. Luckily, there was more salmon sashimi or else...I have heard raving reviews from friends of their high tea buffet and I was quite sure that their other buffet spreads were good seeing that there was always a crowd inside whenever I walk past. Also, you had to call to make reservations 1 week earlier if not it is always full house too.The spread was quite impressive with oysters, baked slipper lobster, crayfish, prawns, mussels, sashimi etc - all very fresh! Highly recommended is the baked slipper lobster topped with torch-flamed-cheese - I had 5 of these and could have more if I wasn't so full. Coming from someone who rarely eat seafood, this counts for something!The cooked food was top-notch as well. I especially like the pig organ stomach soup, french onion soup, fried vermicelli and roast ham. I am not so sure if the nornal buffet dinner has a sumptious spread of desserts but the festive desserts sure didn't disappoint. Highly recommended is the festive cookies in adorable shapes, bread and butter pudding and chocolate marshmallow dip!Note: Do come with an empty stomach and eat slowly! Savour the entire duration of the 3.5 hours long buffet

at $53++, you can eat all the snow crab you want. not a very big buffet spread but the sashimi is fresh and the cooked items like duck, chicken & beef are delicious. of course there is the famous laska corner. make space for dessert - the durian pengkat is yummy

As with so many hotel buffet breakfast areas , the menu is quite boring and never varied but the worst aspect of the Straits Caf√É¬© is the lack of attentive service from the young waitresses -- they seem totally disillusioned with their job and this is reflected in their attention to the needs of customers , especially when it comes to topping up coffee cups

We always stay at the Rendezvous Grand Hotel as a stop over on our way to Australia. The hotel is well situated ( see separate review) and the breakfast buffet in its Straits Cafe is very good, if a little expensive. However, many residents take advantage of the variety, eat a huge breakfast and then skip lunch; we do!There is wide selection of Asian and European food as well as "Continental" breakfast, hot and cold. The Cafe stops serving food at 10.30am which can be a problem if you are jet lagged and need a longer sleep in the morning.The Straits Cafe is also open for dinner, very convenient if you don't want to go out to eat. We ate here once and decided against the dinner buffet (the locals were all eating from the buffet, a good sign), going a la carte deliberately to sample Singaporean food. We had Udang Nanas, comprising king prawns, green and red chillies cooked in a fragrant pineapple gravy and served with steamed rice and Nonya Laksa, comprising thick rice vermicelli cooked with king prawns, crayfish, scallops, fish cakes, quail eggs, shredded chicken and bean sprouts in a spicy coconut gravy. Both were simply excellent. However, the service left something to be desired because, I imagine, most people opt for the buffet. Price was very reasonable and the service charge is automatically added
4
Give it a 4 because, Oysters, Prawns, Sushi and a whole range of Asian dishes in the Buffet really good and authentic. also very close to 2 MRTs - Bras Basah, 2 mins and Dhobi Got max 10 minsBut their wine!, by the glass, portions incredibly small ($9) and basically what ever was left in the bottle yesterday or the day before yesterday - wine in the same hotel from the bar is better 
3
You pay for the ambience because the Muffins I requested were warm but definately not fresh. I was with a Pastry Chef so I feel certain for my criticism. If they want to charge such high amounts then your product has to be good.
5
The international buffet is outstanding in choice and quality with special bank card promotions offering outstanding value. We dined during the chinese new year and the fayre was outstanding. I would recommend this cafe at the Rendezvous Hotel to all my friends and family!
2
Had a yummy durian cake and coffee there. Service was very slow even on a quiet afternoon. Did not have breakfast as it was far too expensive! As it was so expensive we did not try anying else.
4
I would rate this as a decent restaurant. I ate there because I was staying at the Rendezvous. But I would explore.

Our family of 9 adults had the buffet dinner here on a week night.SGD50 ++ per head but there was a bank card promotion, where you pay the price of 2 for 3 diners.There was a good variety in the international buffet spread, including Japanese sashimi, western cold cuts, dim sum (har gao and steamed buns), freshly made roti prata with 3 different curry sauce, seafood and the salad bar. Dessert included fresh fruits, cakes and ice creams. Try the rich durian cake.Enjoyed the teh tarik which was just right for me, not too sweet.Service was good, as dirty plates are cleared and drinking water refilled promptly; but it took a while for the desserts to be replenished
3
Celebrated my son's 4th birthday there and booked a big table for my 15pax guests. Variety is not as much as compared to other hotel but presentation is gd. My guests like their award winning laksa!It seems that the restaurant is understaffed hence be prepared to wait if u have a request. Another point to note, it's not easy to find the carpark entrance, both my hubby and guests had a hard time searching for it LO

The buffet at Straits Cafe was Value for Money. We went there for the first time when we first arrived the varity of food was not alot compared to other buffet.However,quantity was not the issue, the quality of food was marvellous. I especially enjoy the dessert session. I strongly recommended the durian session for all durian lovers. I too enjoy the lemon grass sherbet which I hardly find at other buffet
3
'Ok' for the price point which is around 50.00SGD plus the GST and the Service charge but to be honest you'd be better off to spend another 25.00 and go to the buffet brunch at the Fairmont Hotel located just down the road where the buffet seems to go on forever and leave you feeling satisfied. They did have a good selection but the quality just wasn't that great especially for a city like Singapore. Of course price wise it is better than spending over 150.00++ at some of the other grander hotels but be prepared to feel you could have gone somewhere better

Have not been to cafe at hyatt singapore for a long time. They now have Straits Cafe which caters for big appetite. Went to dinner at 9pm since table only available at that time. Wide varities of buffet from malay, indian, chinese and nyonya food. I like the cilli crabs and that nite eaten half dozen along with fried prawns. The fried kway teo not bad. To enjoy eating crabs I used bare hands. The desserts are not as many as I would expected for a pricey buffet. Although the place is full, the staff are able to put up smiles which I really appreciate. They wont let you keep your dirty plates longer as they will take them away fast. I enjoyed my dinner and that was a treat from my son. Look forward to go there again when I am next in Singapore

It was like a production line with staff clearing your table and resetting for the next meal as soon as possible.The variety compared to some other hotels buffet breakfasts i.e. Imperial New Delhi left a lot to be desired. With one chef cooking your eggs to order meant a long wait for your choice off eggs
