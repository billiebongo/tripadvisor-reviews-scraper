Does some good, and cheap, chicken snacks. Basically a fast food place, but doesn't necessarily do take-a-way. Still, good for a quick bite.
2
Place was full so thought we would give it a try.
Calamari rings were dry and over cooked and the sauce (spicy) actually tasted vial! We scrapped it off.
Chicken wings were better but too sweet and we couldnâ€™t finish them.

The chicken is crispy and the taste is delicious, the price is reasonable and you keep coming back..

Review by Dr Sim. The chicken is good. Chicken skin is well marinated. Unique Asian flavour. However, the inside of the chicken does not seem to be marinated enough. Service is slow. Regards Dr Sim

Our favourite Chicken ,my whole family loved this poace. The chicken very yummy and the price is reasonable.Highly reccomended

One of the best chicken I ever had in years, simple, delicious, and not so expensive. Found it by accident and it was packed with limited seats available, only under curiosity which brought us to visit the counter. I expected something more like regular KFC's chicken but it wasn't, it was bette

Visited the outlet at Ion Orchard to try out their food. Ordered a B.F.F combo for my husband that come with a drink and fries (opted for the seaweed rather than the kimchi) while a la carte chicken katsu sandwich for myself. The bill was SGD18.40. We were given a buzzer to pick up our food. When the buzzer lit and upon picking up the food that supposed to be ready, the lady in spectacles who worked inside the kitchen informed/apologise to me that only the B.F.F combo is ready and I have to keep my buzzer and to continue to wait for my chicken katsu sandwich to be called to collect later.My husband went ahead eating his food as I told him not to wait as his will get cold if he waits for mine. My order was still not called/ready for collection after approximately 10mins later and my husband has almost finished his meal. I walked up to the same lady (kitchen crew in spectacles) to enquire about my order just to be ignored and showed her sulky face being swarmed with order chits in front of her. Very rude behaviour indeed when she specifically told me earlier as the aforementioned. After another 5mins has passed, my husband walked up to the same lady to ask whether if my chicken katsu sandwich is ever going to be made or we have to cancel our order and request for a refund to which once again she had bluntly ignored while continue to pretend to have her eyes gazing at those order chits while her colleague took the courtesy to apologise and check if the sandwich was prepared and presented it to my husband at the next split of second.Verdict: the BFF was tasty and well prepared while the chicken katsu sandwich wasn't what we expected ie deep fried chicken in deep fried chinese bun (man tou) as sandwich??? = extremely oily. Just on the service and the attitude of that particular kitchen crew, my husband and myself agreed that we will not patronage this specific outlet ever again. Hopefully the management of the outlet look into his/her staff be it kitchen crews or cashiers/order takers because their ill behaviour and poor services that they provide will potentially drive their customers away. A pity indeed

First time to try this at ION Orchard and I can say that it's very delicious. The chicken is so crispy and perfectly fried inside and out. Their sauce is also good. Good paired with their seaweed fries or rice. The interiors of the place looks cool. Prices are a bit steep, but if you really would like to try, I say you go for it and see for yourself. Would definitely come back! :

Good value for money. The 18 pc wing and drumlet combo set came with kimchi fries and 3 soft drinks.The chicken was cripsy and well marinated. In fact, too well marinated and drenched with so much seasoning you can hardly taste the natural flavours.I also ordered fried shrimps and calamari. These were also drenched in sauce that was just too salty for my liking.I think Korean fried food is just too salty and has too much seasoning in generalservice is prompt and efficient
1
I had Tofu & Mushroom salad earlier this week in their newly opened branch in JEM, the lettuce is drenched in soy sauce based dressing - too salty for my taste. Tonight I tried their seafood salad, I tried to ask for the dressing to be served on the side - so I can control the amount of dressing to mix - unfortunately they refused saying they don't do that, so I still got a very salty salad. Saving grace, the calamari is goo

this is our sunday lunch place :)
we love 4 fingers wings to the bones! never fails to satisfy our cravings. we just wished they had more space and branches. they don't deliver to farrer park anymore :(
4
unlike KFC this food taste more like handmade and fresh! Portions are real value for Money . The service is quite slow.
5
I loved their crispy chicken so much! You can choose from spicy to regular taste chicken. The use of the pager as your number makes it modern and more advanced compared to other restaurants. The chicken was superb. I was here last March 2014.
5
4 Fingers is a great spot for crispy chicken, and the burgers are good to. The service is friendly and the food is ready within minutes. It can get really busy and seating is limited. The chicken was so good we went back on more than one occasion. This really is worth going to for a bite to eat
1
Last year we ate at 4 fingers and it was well cooked and really nice, so we went out of our way to try again.The meal for 3 people was expensive by food court standards and the chicken was uneatable I don't know if it had been refried or just fried till it was black and dry, none of us could eat the food and left it mostly untouched.Never again really disgusting food at exorbitant prices, better eat Texas Chicke
3
It was my first time having the BBFF. The chicken was succulent & crispy. The sauce was simply delicious. The kimchi was tasty too & the charcoal bun was soft. I really like it a lot. Unfortunately their chicken wings were disappointing. They were not fresh & I was amazed how could they be not fresh when they are so many patrons having their chicken wings? After 1 bite I didn't feel like eating at all. Will go back for their BBFF but not the chicken wings.
5
the best, extremely crispy chicken I had ever have!strongly recommended!just it's a self-serviced fast food place, good for a quick bite.it came with 2 sauce options, we picked the soya garlic, average.might give the spicy one a try next time.we paid extra for a bigger drumstick but found out it was not as crispy as standard one, so not worth the "upgrade".fresh fries were very average
5
Located on the B4 level of Ion Orchard (go down escalators from B2 level, turn right, walk past Food Opera, 4 Fingers is on the left side across from the Japanese place). The drumsticks were really crispy. We opted for the hot sauce for the seafood box which came with plenty rice (enough for two of us to share), crispy calamari and shrimp, slaw which was slathered with what tasted like kochujang-derived hot sauce making it really spicy. We tried their yuzu honey drink (be sure to stir it well since there is a lot of yuzu bits and honey resting on the bottom of the cup beneath the ice). They have chicken burgers and salads too which we did not get to try this time. Highly recommende
5
This is situated in Orchardgate shopping centre and you order your food and are given a pager. When the pager goes off you go and pick up your food from a separate window. The chicken comes with different flavours, fries or rice. It is very reasonably priced, freshly cooked and very tasty. We ate there several times. Highly recommended
2
I liked the chicken burger served though the excess sauce inside was a turn-off. The chicken was crisp though - definitely trying this place again asking them to be gentle with the sauce. The place is small and usually full though located in the basement of the ION orchard.
4
I like the crispy chicken on there, they have taste salty and spicy, i like the salty ones, the spicy chicken are not too spicy, still can be eaten for whom dont like extreme spicy
5
One of the best fried chicken experiences in SIngapore. I went on a recommendation by a friend that lives in SIngapore and I would also like to suggest to give 4 Fingers a try.
5
Although only crispy but processed chicken and crispy chicken seasoning it very tasty. The taste of asia felt at all. and I really like the food premises here. Simple but tasty menu.
4
We ordered 2 drumstick rice sets which came with drinks. Cos us almost SGD20/- in total. But The drumsticks are very flavourful.
5
Come during non peak hours if wanna dine in as it is always long queue and crowded as the seat are limited... love their spicy chicken! My all time favouriteeeee
4
Despite of the long queue,i would still buy 6 pieces crispy chicken wings (mix sauce) whenever i'm craving to have it. Besides, their tofu mushroom salad was delicious too. Having both items are heaven to me.
4
went with my gf. The chicken is crispy and delicious. service is good and friendly. waiting time is ok
4
Chicken still crispy ...
We asked for a less spicy sauce but you can have it spicier.
The chicken is fried nice and crispy
5
This is way too delicious to missed! I love the soy and spicy drumstick with rice of course. I can't decide which I want to order, Kimchi or seaweed fries, both are so yummy. I like the tofu salad but I think it's too salty.
5
As of April 2017, I can't seem to find another fast food chain in Singapore which beats 4 fingers chicken. I have been dining in, taking away and now making orders through Food Panda. The quality of chicken delivered is similar to dining in. For 18pcs of wingettes and drumettes a la carte @$20.95 plus Regular fries @$3.50 with door step Delivery @$3.00, my bill added up to $27.45. Why queue when you can couch with food and watch your favorite drama online?
4
One of my must stop at Somerset. Service was good. The people at the counter were nice and I enjoyed my meal every time.
4
When you crave something spicy and similar to Home ( kentucky chicken) England. Have been away for a month and this hit the spot. Crispy chicken skins, moist chicken and a spicy sauce heaven.
5
Wings with hot sauce is my most favorite (wings are much better than drum stick). Super yummy and crispy! Almost everytime it's crowded. Have to be patient for waiting and Q time else better choose other fast food shops.
5
I've always loved chicken regardless how they cooked it. The chicken here tastes really good, I'm satisfied. I personally loved their wet tissue design tho. And for you who is looking for this place, it's on B4 of Ion Orchard.
4
The best chicken wing I have ever tried! The soy flavor is nicer than the spicy one, but they are still very tasty.
6 is always not enough for me alone.
3
The food is very tasty...but that's about where the positive comments end. Menu is very overpriced and the food is very small position.... The service staff is very friendly n nice...
4
Wewent at ythis shop on thursday evening; there was long line of queue at theorder counter. The quality of chicken meat is good and less oil, so it's not too bloated for our stomach to have 3 pieces. The price was ok with acceptable quality. Worths my wait.
1
This place used to be pretty good at one point. But now the quality has deteriorated like anything. Chicken wings were cold. The burger buns were dry and chicken filling tasteless. And the chicken sandwich smelled funny. No wonder had a stomach upset a few hours since eating this food. Never visiting again
5
Went and buy takeaway for dinner as no one was cooking. The service provided was something extraordinary as the cashier was very friendly and understanding. She even assist to help me change a side which I was not even aware of despite I have bought numerous times. However must prepare to wait for the chicken
4
My friend, who is based in Singapore, kept swearing about her new "I can eat 2 orders" fast food restaurant and so I was curious enough to ask her to take me there. The chicken concept is similar to other Korean-style sesame/soy coated fried chicken but I do like how they tried to set themselves apart by the accompanying dishes (salads, flavored rice, etc). The chicken are perfectly cooked, coated well with the choice of 2 flavors... just enough that it remained crispy.There is a constant queue and customer turnover is very high so this would not be a place to bring a date. Unless you're in middle school or high school. Overall, a good, quick bite if you don't mind standing in a queue to order and hawking over other diners, hoping to snatch a table
5
Like both soya sauce and spicy versions. Children and adults enjoyed the crispy chicken skin as it was well fried (i.e. could not see visible fats). Preferred drumstick to wings as it's easier to eat.
4
2nd time came back and try the mixed crispy chicken in garlic and spicy taste. The mixed chicken was crispy and the sauce was spicy and tasty.
5
In love with the crispy and juicy chicken. Although price is slightly higher than kfc but is worth it. Try to avoid order on peak hour due to the long queue and long waiting list.
2
The chicken is fine, but there is nothing special here really. If you want wings there are many better places and to be honest, there's no art to wings, so a hawker centre is just as good, but a quarter of the price.
5
The food was expensive and it doesnt fill your stomach. But the chicken is delicious as it is very crispy. Quality is there but quantity is not.
5
We were travelling in Singapore terminal 3 and wondered why everyone was lined outside of 4 Fingers Crispy Chicken. Now we know. The burgers and chicken are the best we have experienced and we highly recommend trying it out. If you like crispy chicken you won't be disappointed. The restaurant is downstairs in terminal 3 and the flavourings and seasonings they use are divine. This will definitely be one of our regular stop overs when passing through Singapore.
4
Finally had the chance to try out 4 Fingers that everyone was talking about. The space at JEM outlet was pretty alright considering they had a small section by the side. The price is a little too expensive even if I bought just the ala carte.
3
There's often a long queue in front of 4Crispy Chicken but I got lucky recently, and managed to try their crispy chicken for the first time. You can eat in or order takeaways which usually means a wait of around ten minutes. If there's a long queue, it could mean a longer wait.The all soy chicken wing and drum stick tasted salty and crunchy and the Katsu Sandwich has loads of kimchi.Overall, taste is different from KFC or Texas Chicken....
4
My sister and I wondered around Ion Orchard and found this gem. I had the Drumsticks Combo with the hot sauce and she had the Chicken Chop. Honestly I find the food itself quite good, but it's the sauce which makes this place a star! Will definitely visit again
2
I used to enjoy the food from this eatery until the recent renovation. The standards have plunged beyond recognition. Price has also increased! I chanced upon a Korean fast food chicken concept quite similar named Jinjja Chicken at Bugis village. Way much better with more choices. Don't waste your time trying 4 fingers
4
First time to try this kind of chicken with this flavour. It was differnt an dgood. Chicken here is juicy and better then KFC and similar. Fast service and clean all over, so all in all good for the price here in SIN
3
At first bite you can feel the crispyness of the skins, the more you chew the more feel juices coming out from the meat. Bit spicy and it was okay.
3
tried 4 fingers, for the sake of curiosity.
Are they good? yes, pretty good, but may not be the legendary fried chicken like KFC or others.
5
Whenever i'm in Singapore, the first food i wanted to eat was chicken from 4 fingers. You must try this one! No regrets. It taste like heaven. I hope they have a branch here in Manila :)
4
Ordered 12 pieces of soy garlic fried chicken wings and seaweed fries.
The fries was great however the wings were cold. Staffs were friendly.
Worth to try.
4
It was my daughter and law who chose to go here, I was told it was like KFC so was not sure, however the meal I had was real good and I thoroughly enjoyed it
1
I went into this restaurant expecting good things. They always have a long line when I happen to pass by, and I always hear good things about their food. I was in a good mood, ready to eat some good chicken wings.Ordered the 12 pieces mixed combo meal. Didn't have to queue, and didn't have to wait very long for our order to come. I bit into the first wing, and it was very crispy, tasted ok so far. But as I ate, I became increasingly disappointed. This was the driest chicken I have ever suffered through. Like, it might have been left on the fryer twice as long as it should have been cooking, or it might have been left under a hot lamp before it was picked up? One piece had more flour and breading on it than actual chicken flesh.The taste was ok, but it got lost on the way because of the awful texture of the actual chicken. The horrible, terrible, no good, very bad chicken.This takes away from the awesome staff (the cashier was gracious when I changed my order when I found out that they accept credit card payment; the server carried my order with a smile to have it packed for takeaway because I could not bring myself to finish). But the one star is for the chicken itself. Which was horrendous. Had this at the Plaza Singapura branch. Maybe that makes a difference? Maybe they were having an off day? Maybe I had a bad batch? Don't know. But it's one star (less if possible) for me until I taste otherwise
3
When we arrived at 630pm, there was a long queue waiting to order, then another queue at the pick up area. However, it was quite quick and we were snacking on our chicken about 15 minutes after ordering. We ordered a 12 piece chicken ala carte with soy and garlic, as well as a 12 piece combo, with kimchi fries and a large drink. In addition, we had an order of calamari and shrimp, which was crispy, fresh and light. We liked that they provided local limes, rather than the usual lemon slices. The chicken was very crispy and good, though could have been meatier/bigger.Seating is at a premium, as it is quite a small place, so you need to stand around and then pounce when a table frees up. Of course, to improve the dining experience of the next Customer, you should also clear your table once you are done
5
Very nice place to relax and have a snack, if you can get a place to sit. The place always have a long que but it is worth the wait. The food is well prepared and fairly priced. Very popular with both locals and tourist. A must to try in Singapor
4
I love fried chicken especially crispy ones. I went to the outlet at Orchard Gateway at dinner time. I didn't wait long at the cash counter before it was my turn to order. My order was swiftly taken and the food was ready quite quickly. The drumsticks were juicy and crispy but a little salty. They were yummy and truly "finger licking good." The rice was a little cold. Overall I love the fried chicken and will surely come back
5
I was looking for friend chicken and i FOUND IT . 2 words DO IT the katsu sandwich is off the hook as is the chicken and fries omg my mouth is watering just thinking bout it :D
5
The mix chicken taste really so good I can lick my fingers over and over again but not in public of cos hahaha.. Love the chicken!! 2 thumbs up!!
5
Consistent taste of Korean style crispy tasty wings. The wings were nicely done and not too oily. The queue was always so long though.
3
When eaten immediately, it tasted very crispy and delicious. There is no sense of oiliness. However, as it turned cold gradually, the crispiness is reduced and the saltiness of the sauce became very obvious and I felt very thirsty even after drinking water. Even after I finished eating and washed my hands, the smell of the sauce still lingered on my fingers
3
Finally tried the 4 Fingers crispy chicken combo set at the Westgate branch late on a Friday night (less queue as compared to dinner time). The set comes with 3 drumettes and 3 wings. Requested for half soy and half hot sauces. The chicken is freshly fried, though we find it slightly over fried. The ones in hot sauce is more tasty. It comes with fries with sprinkles of seaweed. The fries are average as compared to those from other fast food chains. Also tried the fried calamari and shrimp in hot sauce. This comes with a lime. Not so spicy but salty due to the soy sauce as well. They seemed to be overly fried. Both sets were served in army mess tins. You will be given a buzzer while you wait for your food. Overall they serve up good Korean crispy fried snacks at slightly reasonable prices as compared to a Korean restaurant selling fried chicken too, which there are quite many these days given the popularity.
4
The chicken here is served really crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Both honey soy and hot flavours are delicious! The kimchi fries go very well with the chicken too. Those opting for a healthier option can go for the bento, replacing fries with calrose rice. The rice is also of good texture and quality. The only downside to this fast food chain are the slightly higher prices. However it is definitely worth a try for fried chicken lovers who want to have a go at fried chicken with a twist of Asian.
2
Tried the chicken drumsticks and wings. Tasted nice but the fries are soft and waited for half an hour. First had to queue to order, then queue to get a seat, after which need to wait 15 minutes for the food which I was disappointed cause the fries were soft and cold. While waiting, I almost finished the ice lemon tea. The only consolation is the chicken which is tasty
4
4 Fingers Chicken Wings are awesome. Despite the long queue, I never miss an opportunity to get their wings. The mix was a good combination as the spicy (quite spicy in my opinion) blends well with the slightly sweet soy wings. I've tried take-away and even after 1 hour, the wings still taste as good as dine-in. The seaweed fries was normal in my opinion but completes the meal
1
Food: Nothing special. Similar to "Burger king". However, average price is double compared to "Burger king", and quantity is half compared to "Burger king". My overall impression: When I heard that Four Fingers is coming to Jurong point, I was very excited to try it. However, in my first visit (on Sep 3, 2015), I found that the shop is closed at 8:00PM. In my second visit (on Sep 6, 2015 at around 4:30PM), I found a huge queue in front of the shop, not waiting for good food, but because of the slow cashiers. In my third visit (on Sep 6, 2015 at around 10:30PM), I ordered a soya garlic chicken burger. After 15 minutes of waiting, I was informed that soya garlic sauce is not available. Moreover, when I came home and opened the box, I found a chicken chop instead of a chicken burger. Enough is enough!! I am not going there anymore
5
Had a nice quick bite to eat here place was not too busy had some wings and the seaweed fries they was just yummy really enjoyed it here. A small eating area but at least there was one there was other places selling food on this floor that did not even offer seating. We also took in a pizza from another place in there and the staff were fine about us having it there. So thumbs up for 4 Fingers 
3
The queue was long on Sunday evening (only one counter was open). We ordered burgers which was below average in taste.
3
Ordered through food panda yesterday. Maybe eating it from delivery is different from having it fresh at the restaurant. The hot and spicy sauce was quite spicy, but the skin had lost its crispiness. French fries quite average.
5
Simply irresistible and spicy. Just hated the slow long lines caused by indecisive people. I just wished that they will provide better spoon to scoop my rice.
1
I try it in Tampines and it taste as not what it claims.
The chicken chop is tasteless, the fry with kimchi favor taste like chilies powder with no where close to kimchi.
Average price per person S$10++ per set with fry and drink
5
Heard about this place on the plane on the way over, and it was everything we expected! Great taste, amazing texture, fantastic flavor!
3
We went to the outlet at ion orchard basement. The queue was long as it was lunchtime.
Food was good. We order the fried chicken drumstick set meal and calamari.
Overall the food was good quality and the seaweed french fries is good.
4
Went with a colleague to 4 Fingers at Plaza Singapura.Queue was long and place was crowded. I have to say that the seats are for Mr and Ms Skinny. The space between seats are so small that probably only chopsticks can walk pass.I dun need to be reminded that chicken wings are not healthy leh.We ordered the combo set with half spicy and half soy sauce ones.The chicken was fried to perfect crisp though i have to say the spicy chicken lacks depth in the flavor. The soy sauce one tasted better for me tho i find them a little on the salty side (it is probably just me).Overall experince was nice though i have to say i dislike the feeling of having hawking eyes on us from other customers who were looking for seats.The one in Changi Aiport T3 is more spacious.
3
I heard a lot reviews about this 4 fingers fried chicken. I have too high expectation but indeed it is kind of disappointing. It is very average standard. I did not really enjoy it. I compare it with Kyochon fried chicken, Chir Chir Korean Fried chicken and etc. I could say this 4fingers cannot beat any of them. I am not sure why the queue always wrong at Ion Orchard
4
I've eaten at the ion outlet now 3 times and their chicken seriously is the crispiest and tastiest! I really love the seaweed fries and the garlic seasoning for the chicken. Their chicken wrap was super delicious and fresh with lots of vegetables and a lovely tangy citrus dressing. I've also eaten their tofu and mushroom salad which was a good large portion with a lovely savory/sweet dressing that worked very well.In terms of problems I had, out of the three times I've eaten their chicken, there was once that there was TOO MUCH of the spicy sweet sauce which caused the chicken to be terribly salty.Another issue I had was their yuzu drink being too concentrated and therefore not pleasant to drink.This place really has the crispiest chicken but inconsistencies are expected and this fast food isn't exactly cheap. Totally worth a try especially if you do have a liking for fried salty chicken
1
Changi Airport Outlet. Thursday dinner. 8:30PMI'm here to comment on the service. Never mind the long wait for ordering at the counter (approx 30 minutes, slow fast food yeah), never mind the lack of staff at the outlet, but the counter boy's f-ed up attitude really takes the cake.After ordering our 2x 18pc combo, we noticed the lack of the DBS promotion applied to our final bill despite using a DBS card. We asked the counter boy, and he replied, "because you didn't say. The promotion will give a different set.". No wait, say what? You mean if we asked for the DBS promo you will give us a shittier meal? Nevermind that, it's cool. And then, he rolled our eyes at us. No seriously, we weren't even rude to him. That sums up our experience. Which I honestly, after looking at the rest of the review here, you guys don't give a sh** anyway. I guess you guys just sell wings, nothing more
2
Dined at the Changi Airport Branch. The favouring is mainly on the chicken skin and not the meat. The skin is over fried and salty while chicken meat underneath is pale and quite tasteless compared to the skin.
4
I had a very great time with my wife,food was good. They have afew selections of sauces for the chix wings. Even though the place was busy,yet they managed to serve us well. Great job!
5
Service is fast. Once your order, less than 5 minutes you can get the food. A little crowded during peak hours on weekends. Chicken is so crispy I can eat 3 drumstick with rice. Prefer mix as the hot can be counterbalance with soy.
1
This is the worst fried chicken I've ever had. My first time eating 4 fingers, visited the outlet at Changi Airport. Had a nice chat and purchased wings as a set thanks to the lovely counter staff's recommendation for a late night snack for 2pax.Not against the branding, but it is just too expensive for the cheapest parts of a chicken, just too salty and fried till dry and alittle tough, we struggled to finish up even though we were hungry.A revisit to try other items is not necessary in my opinion
1
Out of 3 counters, only 1 was opened so you can imagine the queue that was forming. This marketing gimmick was part ofthe genius of the original Dutch owners. It was early so I chose to close and eye and not let this bother me. The chicken, being the core product of this one trick pony was disappointing! Which leaves me to think the do rely heavily on the understanding that we there's a queue, we'll think the food is good.I had the 3 piece chicken drumstick and painfully watched the single counter staff prepare the drinks, while conversing with the guys in the kitchen. Don't expect any urgency here since they do want you to spend time in the queue. Back to the chicken! Personally, I don't quite get what the hype is all about. If I wanted crispy, Old Chang Kee's wings would hit the spot. The chicken here at 4 fingers was very salty but the saltiness was just very much on the surface. I don't know what went wrong in the marinade. Overall? Blah....Wouldn't be bothered queueing. Absolutely trash I say!
4
Visited Westgate outlet to join in the hype for the first time. Queued for about 10 mins, with only one counter opened at abt 8pm. Then another staff opened the other counter, made it more faster. Staff was patient, explained the various sets available, paid approx $25 for 3 sets of meal. Aircon seating is limited, more outdoor options, baby chairs are avail too ;) Waited for another 8-10mins to collect our food, everything is hot and freshly made. Love the wrap that comes with salsa sauce. Husband ordered the chicken burger, juicy and love the toasted bun. Mixed 6 wings and drumlets were crispy and flavourful. In all, just another different kind of fast food, it's whether you can appreciate the unique flavours, and willing to try something different. The kind of food that don't need additional chilli/tomato sauce, unlike at other fast food chains. Fries served was generous too, choice of kimchi or seaweed flavour.Only one elderly cleaning crew that evening, so advised to clean up and return trays after your meal so others can patron the place ;)I don't mind going again, if the queue is shorter/shorter queuing time to try the other meals
3
Visited the Changi outlet & tried for the 1st - time this recently added fast food chain. Long queues are usually spotted during weekends and at some outlets like Westgate. Visited close to 3pm seats are available. No highchair though for babies.Ordered 2 of their bestsellers which are quite expensive imo (see my uploaded photos).The fried chickens are tasteful with soy+garlic. Too salty even for one who takes salty food more than sweet. Can't taste any garlic, but are crispy when eaten immediately upon collection from the pickup counter.The fries are normal and only occasionally can taste the little seaweed seasoning and some chilli flakes. I prefer more seaweed on my fries.Juices drip out of the burger, but similarly chicken is too salty with not much taste of the garlic.The Yuzu drink is average, not too bland.We are provided with wet wipes and tissue thus good for after meal cleanliness.Will only re-visit the outlet if price is cheaper & chicken is less, less salty
5
This chicken is awesome. The spicy drumsticks will knock your socks off they are so good. The fries are pretty good. There are plenty of tables at the Changi location, The other I saw at Raffles was very small, but I'm sure the chicken was just as delicious
1
I visited the Changi Airport outlet. Ordered a chicken chop and a chicken burger. Both were over fried. Half the chicken chop as well as the burger patty were skin and batter. Both were extremely salty. As for the fries, the seaweed powder was only sprinkled on the surface. Worst, paid a bomb for such poor quality food. Not recommended at all
3
Not sure why there's always a line at this place. Tried it the first time today and had the 6 wings/drumlets in different flavors. I guess it was a good thing that the chicken came out hot but honestly, it was also dry. The flavors were just so so, not bad but nothing worth getting in line over. The fries however, were disappointing. Limp and shoestringy, it's probably better to take them off the menu.
3
Visited the outlet in the Westgate mall. Only a small queue so it didn't take too long to be served, as then about a 10 minute wait for the order to arrive. Fairly average fried chicken: nothing to get too excited about.
4
The crispy chicken they make is awesome. I had to wait in a long line but it was truly worth the wait. I loved it a lot and can not wait to go n try it again the next time I am in Singapore
5
I Just went out to try 4 fingers just by friends advice, but when i tasted the burger it was the Best Chicken Burger i have ever tasted in my life .

It is another "fast food" chain that sell "fast food" at a higher price, about SGD10 per set. worth trying .. and I will wanna go back again to try other stuff in their menu. but I will think twice if the Queue is long, based my experience, their Q moved slowly, no comment if it is the fault of the customer or the staff

There has been always a long queue, yesterday happened to see there was not so long queue, decided to try once. The result turns out to be a dissaster. I waited for 40mins, although there were not so many person. I suspect they intentionally make customers wait to show off to potential customers that 'our food is worthy for such waiting time', I concluded definitely not. Don't waste time, just eat KFC

So, I've been hearing about Korean chicken. They fry it twice I believe to achieve a crispy exterior. I was excited that they opened this outlet in Westgate. There was a lineup out the door but it's not a big place so it just means there were about 8 people in line. We opted for the chicken wings mixed option (garlic and hot). They give you a pager so you can pickup your order when it's ready- it only took 10 minutes. The wings were slightly sticky from the sauce and not really anything special. The garlic was fairly bland and while I don't usually like too spicy wings, the hot wings were definitely the favourite. I don't think I'd come back again though. I know there are other options and maybe it would be tastier but it wasn't worth a return trip for me

One of the best Fried chicken I've ever tasted, their chicken chop and spicy chicken wings were very tasy. The choose of soy garlic or spicy for the skin of the chicken is a good option, I personally like the soy garlic. The only negative is the queue, it can be very long especially during peak hour, but I would definitely come back again for their tasty chicken, 100% worth i

Had been seeing queues outside Westgate whenever lunch so decided to engage my fellow colleagues to try it out. Space is limited so be here early before 12pm. Expect the average staff giving average service. Order the drumlets, drumsticks on spicy flavour wiith both kimchi and seaweed fries. There are 6 of us and we concluded the soy is too much for our delight. A couple of u need to drench our thirst on more than a drink. Thanks but the addictive flavour is too much for our taste buds

This place always have queue, or at least the one in Plaza Singapura and we finally managed to try this fried chicken. It is delicious and the serving quite generous. The seating area very standard for fast food but they did provides some discount for students that makes this place attractive for students. Apart from that, very well marinated chicken and taste different from other fried chicken as well

Trying it for the first time. It was the famous Korean fried chicken.Ordered the mix flavour of wings & drummets with Spicy Flavour & Soy Sauce Flavour. Both tasted very good. Well marinated. Crispy outside. Juicy inside.For the fries, we tried the seaweed flavour - very nice.Ordered another chicken salad. The sauce was a bit too salty for my taste.Overall the fried chicken is the best. Definitely will try again

It is very crispy... worth a try especially the 'hot' flavor in their menu.. But ... i think it has too much seasoning/salt/msg in it.. I couldn't finished the 6 pcs in one go without drinking lots of water.

Their menu is much similar to BonChon. Food served at this restaurant is worth it for the price. From their chicken, calamari and flavored fries, it is certainly a delight. This explains the long queue outside the store at all time.

After dinner over the weekend, I had a craving for Fried Chicken, so I decided to try 4 Fingers for the first time, after hearing about it from my friend. Was in town, so I went to the outlet at Ion Orchard. It is located at Basement 4 It has takeaway and dine-n options.It was crowded at 9.45pm and this was probably the post-shopping crowd. The queue at Ion Orchard was long, but it moves fast. You will be given a 'beeper' which will beep when your order is ready, so you can walk around if you are waking away, or go to your seat and wait for your order.I decided on a pack of 5 drumsticks, which came with a soft drink and pack of fries. - For the drumsticks, you have a choice of soy sauce or hot. The first drumstick was alright, but I find the soy sauce salty. I much prefer the hot versio, but it may be a tad spicy for some. - For the fries, you have a choice of kimchi or seaweed fries. I chose the seaweed version and the staff sprinkled seaweed seasoning onto the fries. It had a hint of spiciness from the chilli flakes in there. If you have kids, better to ask for plain version.I will try their chicken drumlets and wings next time, to see if it is better than the drumstick version. Good for a quick and fuss-freemeal

premise - quite cool looking and looks more spacious than other outletslocation - CHANGI airport Term 3 @ B2staff - rude non-local staff. she was very unclear in her speech for the offers that were going on. Serving crew behind the kitchen were also robotic in deliverycrowd - when i was there it was 945pm so i dont expect a crowd of coursefood - 18 pcs of HALF wings that set me back $21?! nah.... it aint worth it. It's just the 'in' thing now. soon it will be fast food of the past.verdict - go to try! that you have to do. go to go back? not worth it really

Not bad of korea fastfood restaurant, I order 6 pcs chicken and average as same as KFC. Price are not bad cheaper than KFC. Food are bigger than KFC. Not bad but is alot of food so I can't finish it for a combo meal.For your advice is that if you are alone better don't eat alone there find someone to share your food than waste food and money

Worst Fast Food/ Chicken I've ever tasted! Waste of time, money and stomach! They looked nice but nothing tasted like what they seemed. Took only one piece and felt like vomiting! Everything is artificial n full of MSG, fake flavouring. Confusing queue, confusing menu.... Confusing food

Ordered 18 pieces of soy garlic flavor chicken. The chicken actually made up of drumlets and wings. There's always a queue so we thought of trying it. I'm a huge fan of chicken and beer in Korea. The queue was pretty long but the ordering speed was pretty fast. There was a card promotion and we got a combo that comes with soda and fries. It was my first time ordering and I got a little confused as I wasn't aware of the promotion. I couldn't really understand what the counter staff was explaining. We waited for quite a while for the food to be prepared. I saw quite a number of people getting confused if there was their order or not, but no staff actually entertained them (because they were busy preparing for others' orders). The chicken itself was pretty nice given that it was frozen chicken they used. But, the seasoning was too salty and sweet at the same time. I only had 4 pieces and I got sick of the thick seasoning. It actually continued quite an amount of msg too. For fries, we ordered kimchi flavor and I thought it tasted very weird. It doesn't taste like kimchi at all. It tasted like some sort of spice powder sprinkled over the fries. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this at all. This is nothing like fried chicken from Korea. I have no idea what's so hype about it and the long queue. Maybe people who likes salty and sweet foods will like it, but not for me. We actually had to force ourselves to finish the box of chicken. It's about $22 for 18 pieces of chicken and this is considerably expensive. I wouldn't pay that kind of money for this quality of food again

Eat in singapore resto for me, the food less salt and the taste really plain but in here very different... the chicken is crispy and full of seasoning.. the unique way to eat it with u're bare hands :) I tell my friend it is worth to try ..

this special chicken from Korea has got me addicted! The tiny pieces of chicken wings (VS large part of chicken pieces from other brands) either in original or spicy flavors are irresistible. You just go on and on! Flavorful, and crispy. And the fries are a must tooI realised that the chicken from Plaza singapura actually tastes the best - i might be biased so just go try it yourself

Dropped by for a takeaway but some of their food items were not ready yet as they had just opened for the day. The crew at the counter was friendly and we paid for our food to be collected in half an hour's time. Collection was a tad slow though.The food did not disappoint and had a really great taste. WIth it being my first time trying, I was pleasantly surprised with the taste and size of the serving.Will come back for more
