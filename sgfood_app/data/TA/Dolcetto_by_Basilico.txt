I loved having breakfast at Dolcetto. It was my first time(a friend had suggested it) and I will definitely visit it again. The staff made me feel very welcome and there is a nice choice of hand made pastries.Superb!

I was stumped with where to eat one day and popped into Basilico. There were many options, a buffet or alfresco and there is something on the menu for everyone.
5
The breakfast choices are limited but very good still. We love the creamy hot chocolate. Staff was efficient, especially MOntecarlo. Two thumbs!

Good coffee and pastries are one of my weakness. I appreciate having it when I need it, so this is a plus for staying at the Regent Hotel. I also had the fruit cup with orange juice on the bottom. That was also good.

Been there several times during our seminar. Rare to have excellent Italian food outside Italy. They DO

Fruit tart pastry around...Not too sweet. Always found Paul's and Artisan BC (sponge cake) to be too sweet. lovely berries for toppings. Friendly staff, who remember MSinclair (the current FSV gm) as fondly as we do....Will be back to try their bread options.

It was wonderful to find a cafe that had my favourite coffee “Illy”. I had a macchiato before starting my day. I came back again after spending 4 hours in the Singapore Botanical Gardens for another macchiato plus a cake was what was needed. It felt like I was in Italy. Great service, coffee and cake. I will be back again

A place to visit, even if you are not staying at the Regent Hotel. Great for a little breakfast with fantastic Italian coffee, or to relax in the afternoon with a hand made Italian cake or pastry. Calming, pretty surroundings and top quality light snacks including sandwiches and gelato

I am not a fan of Buffets! But at breakfast and for lunch (part of a conference) I enjoyed the buffet the food was well presented (although the layout was a little confusing) and the food fresh and well prepared. At Dinner i had the Al La Carte, which was very good with a great wine selection by the glass. Not in number but in quality

It's as though the Basilico Restaurant is not enough. But, its' ulittle sister Dolcetto offer food and sweets on a par with Basilico standards. Ever see black squid ink panini rolls ? They have them and others. My favorite is the " Life Preserver" sized ( my name) sugar doughnuts. Could not walk by without buying one ! Just another reason for us to stay at the Regent Hotel.My recommendation -- Go

Tucked into a corner of the Regent Hotel this is the perfect place for rich chocolate cake and delicious coffee (other food available). Great selection of cakes (some cake and coffee deals) and a colourful shop.
5
I had one of the best and quickest soup and smoothie at Dolcetto. The service was understated by extremely efficient.
5
We had a fantastic meal there on our last night in Singapore. The food was wonderful and cooked and seasoned well. We really enjoyed our meal and the waiter was very attentive. The meal was well worth the price we paid.
5
We were lucky to be staying at the Regent and therefore able to enjoy a variety of the fabulous savoury and sweet items, light meals, fresh juice and breakfast items as well as very good coffee. Incredibly pleasant staff, should be on everyone's list !definite

A good place to pick up sandwiches, pastries and chocolates. Good selection of sweets. But more than everything else, a great place to sit and enjoy great Italian coffee.
5
Gorgeous patisserie lovely food. Special mention to the staff as they were all happy, charming and helpful especially (and I apologize I don't know his name) but lovely Indian man serving in there. Always happy and cheerful.
5
This place has some really nice pastries and breads. Great for those little hunger pangs. Pro tip ... they offer major discount before they close for the day.

I've been coming off and on for the past 5 years and only remembered the name yesterday. It's basically the lounge of Regent Hotel, with the bakery adjacent serving food.Yesterday's coconut lemon tart had intense flavors. But my italian bottled soda was not "fresh". The tart and cup of coffee cost $14, the bottled drink cost $4.What is more expensive is the parking in this hotel! It's self serve.If not to meet someone, I would avoid this place! It's just not worth it
5
The cafe is part of the Regent Hotel and quite small. However they have space to sit both inside the hotel lobby or outside in a tiny outdoor area. The cakes are superb - it's my go-to place if I need to get desert for a friend's dinner party, or if I just want something sweet and indulgent. They also have good panini, salads and quiche. I'm not sure if they have it all the time, but the lobster bisque (soup of the day) plus waygu beef panini set for S$18 is a steal

I have been known to visit twice in a day some days! I know it's a sad reflection of my priorities - and coffee and wine do come first...Great deserts - and condiments. The soup of the day is great too - if you was so inclined
