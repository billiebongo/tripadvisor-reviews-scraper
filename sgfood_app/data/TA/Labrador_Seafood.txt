We loved this place for its relaxed ambience, tasty food and the pool table. Disappointed to find it's now a building site.

We come to Labrador seafood a few times a year and really enjoy the ambiance. It is quieter and cheaper than almost all of the other seafood restaurants in Singapore and you can walk off a large meal with a stroll around Labrador park.

Tucked away, hidden in Labrador park., no airs and grace, just down to earth good food and good service. Try the Indonesian prawns, they are finger licking good.
Well worth a visit with family and friends

Having spent a less than entertaining hour or so in Labrador nature reserve we wandered along the boardwalk and happened upon this wonderful place. The kids were desperate for a drink and sit down, but once we saw the menu we decided to eat. The food did not disappoint. This was a cool little oasis in the park, which had no cafe open at all. The food was freshly cooked, reasonable priced ( except the French fries at $9 the most we have paid on the holiday so far) and very flavoursome. I wasn't sure what I ordered but the man in front of me had it and it looked lovely, and when it arrived tasted just as nice. We would highly recommend this restaurant, made even more enjoyable as it felt like a little oasis on a hot humid day.

We just went to eat the seafood on Labour Day. There are a lot of seafood.. Quite fresh. But the food taste were just average, not very suitable for us, especially the BBQ squid and chicken wings. Maybe others may like them. We went there for the small lobster promotion, $1 per piece. But I didn't enjoy too much as I couldn't take the spicy too much. My hubby enjoyed eating the small lobster a lot. The Gong Gong, La La shells were also fresh, but Gong Gong were too sandy. But the restaurants's environment is still consider nice, and it is very near to Labrador Park. After dinner, we can go to the park and let kids run around to play for a while. Overall, still a nice place to try.. But not a place which I will come back frequently.

If you are near the Labrador park in Singapore, try this restaurant! It was suggested to me by a local taxi driver - I asked for a place to take lunch, and he said that locals go to this restaurant for many years, and it's one of the best seafood in the area. It's a simple place, more like a house with aimchairs, sofas, table of billiards on the terrasse... nice refreshing wind from the sea keeps you fresh, so one does not feel hot weather. Seafood is very good. Lovely simple place. Recommended

Labrador Seafood provides good service and excellent food in a kitschy, cozy indoor/outdoor environment inside Labrador Nature Reserve and near the water. While perfect for the single traveler, or couples, Labrador Seafood is also an excellent spot for dining with a large group of friends or family. It's casual, homey, and there's a huge menu that will appeal to both the conservative and the adventurous eater.Highly Recommended

This restaurant is like stepping into Thailand, but in a good way! It's outdoors, relaxed, simple and the food and service is good. Everything we have ordered we have really enjoyed. Great for a casual night out with the family or come on a Sunday and enjoy the music next door

Had our family dinner here last evening. We love the location which is beside the sea, opposite sentosa. We had a walk by the sea before and after our dinner.There is quite a number of diners but not as packed as what you experienced in shopping centres. Ample and free parking is a plus point. You have a choice of indoor (max 8 tables if I am not wrong) or al fresco dining where you can get to enjoy the natural breeze. Service is good and the staff are accomodating. You will be surprised at their offerings of BBQ food (not available during lunch) and beverages like wine and beer. I believe all the staff are Chinese. Quality of food is reasonable but if yoy tie it to the price, personally I think it us slightly on the high side. We ordered BBQ platter, king prawns, bamboo clams, salmon, etc and final bill was around $226.I am keen to be back again soon. Not for dinnder but to enjoy my drinks by the sea
