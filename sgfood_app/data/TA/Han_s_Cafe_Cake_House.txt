We come here often during both pre and post renovation. The ambience has definitely improved after the renovation.
The cold food selection of salads, pastas and desserts are a welcome addition to their regular menu.
Will definitely more often!

Nice & clean environment. Open 24/7, with freshly prepared western and Asian food. A place where my family can count on for a nice quick bite. Highly recommended. Slightly pricier than the local kopitiam but we would gladly pay for a comfortable environment and friendly service

Located at Bedok community centre, this is the only F&B establishment in the area. The lucky thing is that it serve great food and is run by a group of friendly service staff ! Anytime for a quick meal ! The environment of the Resturant is also quite cosy . Great for any occasion !

Many would have taken this chain of eatery for granted in view of the consistent standard & value it maintained, across the island. For our family, the usual order would be the chicken cheeseburger, fried rice with egg, ham and prawn, pasta in tomato base with chicken cutlet & Singapore BeeHoon. Breakfast favourites were the scrambled egg with toast and choice of meat

The hor fun is very good as well as the fried rice.Expect a queue if you're having dinner there. I usually eat there for supper after midnight as the restaurant is open 24 hours. There used to be a LED TV showing soccer matches but since a few months ago the TV is no longer showing (permanently switched off). The sound system is very good and i really enjoy the acoustics when they play music. It's not just because it's a Bose but the person who did the installation has done a very good job with his placement and EQ. It's self-service as in there is no wait staff. You place your order at the cashier counter and will keep a pager like device that will buzz when the food is ready. As it's open 24 hours, it is a good place for me to have late night food as there is less people and you get to eat in a peaceful environment.I've seen an increase in price gradually and some menu items such as salad are no longer offered. All in all the food is pretty decent.I'll be back again... for the hor fun
