Tastes just like it does in the southern coast of France, the crepes are so authentic that if i close my eyes it's like I'm back in Bretagne =)

Decent crepes and galette. Also the acai bowl was alright. Only one hot plate to make the crepes thigh so service was very slow

Lovely breakfast visit to TDR for a crepe. Portions are not huge but certainly sufficient for what we wanted. Staff were extremely generous and welcoming. Fantastic latte!

First visit and find nothing fantastic though. Limited selection and very expensive. Didn't expect the portion is so small . Cozy place and nice to relax . Visit unless you are willing to pay for the price !

Thought the menu looked interesting so I wanted to give it a shot. Food was pretty tasty and creamy cold brew was good.

Definitely a conducive work environment to get work done. The yuzu crepe is also worth a shout. Get the set for a cuppa as well.

I really like the crepes at The Daily Roundup, tho the offerings are a bit limited. Doesn't matter since I always get the same thing lol. The ambience is also really cozy and it's a nice place to spend the afternoon.

Came here on Labor Day (public holiday) for brunch with some friends. We arrived at 12:30 and the staff informed us that they only have ham and chorizo crepes for savory and all the other sweet ones. A friend of ours was vegetarian so he had no choice but to order grilled cheese which was pretty standard and over priced. At 1pm my friend came in late and she tried to order food and they just told her that the kitchen was closed. Such a poor service. I've never heard of a restaurant that don't have any vegetables to serve. I ordered a chorizo crepe and it was ok. Not bad, not good. I was hungry and just wanted food but did not even finish it. The photos look better than what it taste. I won't recommend it and I don't think I'll be back either. I think the service was really bad especially if it's a long weekend, they should've expected more business and be prepared for it. I'll find another crepe place because this was just a disappointment. They don't really serve anything else aside from sweet crepe so going here for lunch was an error. I think this is just a coffee place/cafe trying to be a restaurant

On the edge of Chinatown, this café is trendy and clean.After ordering at the counter, customers can study, relax or chat away with friends. Although the café offers both savory and sweet crepes, I wanted something lighter, opting for the Moroccan Spicy Quinoa Salad. I was pleasantly surprised with the generous portion and blend of spinach, pomegranate, quinoa and all the other ingredients. I'd also recommend the Earl Grey Passion Fruit Tea

Wanted to order the acai bowl, duck crepe, and a beer but they were all sold out. Service staff said they would give us a free cookie as an apology but didn't. Savoury crepes were tough. I asked for my egg to be fully cooked but the yolk still turned out runny. Sweet crepe fared better. Food was also not value for money.

the crepes were good though quite pricy for the little portions and toppings. the service provided were very average.

Welcome change of pace in a spacious environment. Good food. Good feeling. Service with a smile. How many more words to 100?

Chope reservation helped us get a good seat as per request for a date. Staff was very friendly and crepes were great.

The crepes are really very average tasting and very overpriced. The service staff are friendly but forgetful when it comes to food order. Quiet place to hang around and to have a coffee but just avoid the crepes.

Enjoyed the salted caramel crepe. Absolutely delicious! Great location and would definitely come back again!

Crepes and galette are quite expensive. Portion is small for the price point and you can't go there on an empty stomach because it is not filling enough as a meal. Seating area is not very big. Best to book in advance or go during off peak hours.

This cafe located on the 1st floor of The Working Capitol is really great to work, alone on in a group. However, I was a bit disappointed with the food as the crepes are quite simple (for instance the chocolate one has only a chocolate topping, and no garniture inside). Same problem for the yuzu crepe (where I did not even find the taste of yulu)It seems quite inappropriate as we see the price ($12 minimum for a crepe, $20 for a salty galette)At the end, this place has a really good working atmosphere but the value for money is quite low as the crepe were below my expectation

I searched out this place because they offered only crepes and I love crepes. Not good. The joy of crepes is that they are served piping hot. The sweet crepes Weren't hot enough and so the butter didn't melt on it - or Rather with difficulty. The savory crepes didn't haven enough ingredients and done in a strange way - so it looks like some random ingredients scattered on top of a crepe. Disappointing. Nothing wrong with atmosphere or service - purely from a food standpoint it was extremely average and forgettable

Great little place for a coffee or drink in a cool part of town. Above is a Creative workspace office complex so lots of interesting folk....A little pricey at $33 for a small fresh juice, flat white and mushroom galette ($18) which was undercooked.Nice vibe thoug
4
Went here cos had a 50% promotion from UOB which made it much more value for money. Portions were small for the original price. The sweet crepes tasted better than the savoury ones, especially yuzu infused butter yum! I wouldn't be back cos of the price unfortunately.

Very nice galettes, they tasted authentic, but I think that the fillings inside the savoury galette could be a bit more generous. Their salted caramel crêpe is very tasty! A must try.
2
I was really looking forward to try the galette but the mushroom galette is really disappointing
Tasted dry and not much flavor not sauce

This is a rare venue which does wonder coffee and cold press juices. What is amazing is their crepes selection and desserts. Great place to relax and get some work done over a latte.
Order over the counter and Service are always friendly and efficient!

Acai bowl was delightful, fresh, & so filling. Not too sweet too, which is a bonus for me.Cold Brew White Coffee was AMAZING; such creamy milky flavour but coffee taste strong too. Absolutely delicious.Free WiFi (get the password/code on a slip of paper from the counter staff- each password/code is valid for 1 device for 1 hour), so I sat in a corner (on my own) doing some work. It was a good experience & very comfortable. Service was good too. Definitely a cafe I will visit & also bring my friends to

good ambience and a very chill place. if you are looking at a place for some catching up with your friends or just want to kill some time and you are nearby, this is the place to be! they serve pretty good cold brews especially the white ones. not a fan of crepes cause I thought they were a little too overpriced. the savoury ones however was better than the sweet ones.

Yes, crepes were delightful but atmosphere could use some freshening up.Some carpentry work was going on there between 1900 - 2000 which meant deafening drill noises every 10 minutes rendering any attempts at conversation futile - no forewarning given on this when we entered at 1850 and started ordering.Place was practically empty during this time and yet staff took orders with a face of steel and one eye on his phone all the time. I could get more cheer from a bus driver when I enter a bus

Had breakfast on two recent occasions and found the food quality to be high and consistent. It takes time to prepare the crepes/galette and I noticed that a busy day would mean a fairly long wait for your food which is ordered at the counter. Coffee is good and the place is nice and bright with well spaced out and comfortable seating

The worst crepe ever - burnt, thin, miserable tiny. Not worth the value at all!Cold brew coffee at least considered a pass. Simple deco, went on a Saturday afternoon, more than half empty. If you need a place to rest with no other options nearby, hop in - as u will find plenty of seats around. If not, do yourself a favor by going elsewhere

My husband is a French native and we were both excited to try a new creperie here in Singapore. To our disappointment this was by far the worst galette we have tried. It is all self service, you have to sit yourself at the table, order at the cashier and pick up your food. The selection is very limited and there is only one cheese commonly used for all the dishes- Comte.We ordered the salmon and the caramelised onion. Both were cold when they arrived, the galette was soft and soggy. I have attached photos as evidence to show how the galette sticked onto my plate and I had to scrape it off with my knife and fork. I'm not sure how a piece of galette sticks into the plate like that, it was gross. There was hardly any taste of the cheese. We did not finish our plates. To which no member of staff noticed, none asked if everything was alright or greet us goodbye.I will be surprised if this restaurant will still be open in the next 6 months with such poor standards.Unsatisfied and hungry, we took a taxi to our favorite creperie Entre-nous

Found this site through the bookings apps Chope. Was pleasantly surprised by this cool eatery. It is more like a cafe than a restaurant and orders have to be placed at the counter. Nice crepes and we particularly enjoyed the Yuzi crepe. Great way to round up the week if you are in the maxwell/tanjong pagar region.
