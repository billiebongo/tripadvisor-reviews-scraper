No regrets every time I bring guests here. Cosy, friendly and heart put into preparing every dish. Dessert to die for.
5
Reasonable priced hearty food. Love the meat platter options which offers you a variety of dishes at a go. Desserts could be better though...
5
Food was awesome and pork was tantalising. Desserts were intriguing and taste awesome! Had a great time w my friends!

After reading the good reviews on TripAdvisor I must admit I was disappointed with Fat Lulu's. We visited on our last night whilst transiting through Singapore. I found the food to be rushed and overpriced for what it was.
5
Overall experience is great. Highly recommend the meat board, which the steak is tender and moiste. It almost melts into your mouth.
Burnt corn is also good. It’s a pity that we don’t have space for dessert. Will definitely try next time.
5
Overall great experience even thou we have to wait a while for the food. But the food are delicious so it's definitely worth the wait! Thumbs up. Will visit again soon :)

Fat Lulu's: The title of the restaurant is deceiving, to say the less. Portions are minuscule and you end up hungry with a sgd140 bill for two. Never had so little food for so much, even in starred restaurants. Apart of that, service was in the local standards of Singapore: one ends up eating 15 min after the other, who already waited 30/40 min. Bread was brought after all mains were finished, i.e. over one hour after ordered. For a (small) piece a bread. It is unfortunately very typical in SG but still shocking when coming from abroad. That being said, for only 5 or 6 tables, I presume the kitchen organisation should be dramatically reviewed to address this issue. All the tables were in the same situation. One the brighter side, the little we had tasted good.But not enough to justify poor service standards and a major lack of generosity in the plate.

FAT LULU has lived up to the rave reviews. Everything waa on point and my family and I truly had one of our best meals having travelled to try Michelin star restaurants every year . Kudos to the chefs . Special mention must be made of Bobby 's friendly service too. Will be going back again for another celebration!

AmbianceNice and cozy setting but bear with the seating capacity. It's quite limited so any large crowd is not advisableFoodI love most of what we ordered. It's surprisingly nice for a quaint little restaurant like this except, I find every dish we ordered were too salty for my liking. Feels rather unhealthyPriceAverage to exServiceNot too bad. Quite attentive staff who'll readily change your soiled plates to fresh onesVerdictWill definitely revisit except I hope taste-wise can be less salty in my next visi

I am always a bit of a skeptic of the “fusion” movement so wasn’t sure what to expect of this place when introduced to it by another SG couple. The restaurant is in a converted traditional house along River Valley Road.Bread with the seaweed butter was soft and fresh to start. We ordered the Pig Out sharing plate. They were mostly char-grilled meats (char siu, beef, pork satay) hamachi head and veg (kai lan, bakes potatoes, asparagus). They were prepared either oriental or western style so thankfully not “fusion” as such but presented on the same board. It actually worked well.Wine choices however were short but the Tempranillo was good.The deserts however were absolutely delightful. Here the fusion worked. The gula malaka creme brûlée was wonderful and so was the chocolate plate.Service was informal, friendly and efficient. All in all a very satisfying dining experience
4
Food was flavourful and delicious. but dishes were cramped on the table i.e. glasses, wine, basket of bread, appetiser...
5
An incredible meal. Had guests in town and was blown away by how incredible every single dish we had was. Would most definitely return
5
Yummy food with a nice kick of Asian spices. Has a carpark just next to it which makes it convenient to get to!
5
One of our favourite restaurants. Kids love the ribs, the clams. My personal favourite? Pineapple Ice Kachang!
5
Cozy place and very well-run. I've enjoyed every visit here - delicious food and knowledgeable staff. The vegetables are just as good as their meat dishes. I love the curry fried cauliflower, and the burnt greens (padron peppers and snow peas).
4
Food served was great, however service was a little slow, perhaps because they had only 2 staff on the floor. Overall, a wonderful experience.
5
You will eat like a local and have a wonderful experience. Make sure you leave room for dessert. It is incredible.
4
We love the dessert most. The presentation and taste is so unique and imagine. There's many choices of dessert in the menu. We definitely will be back!
5
This quaint little restaurant has a great vibe to go with its interesting and innovative menu. Dishes have a good mix of east west flavours and the small menu is very well put together not to mention the freshness of ingredients. Curried cauliflower, Ikan Baker and Spicy BBQ Ribs are highly recommended.They have a knock-out dessert menu so plan well in advance when placing your order. I would go again just for their desserts. You will totally forgive the tight eating space after experiencing the fab food 
5
Came here on a Friday night dinner with 3 girl friends, ordered a bowl of clams, bbq pork and steak and curry cauliflower and a 10 course of small bites of desserts to share. Amazing food and bomb my taste buds. Friendly and efficient service. 4 of us bill total less than $200.
5
Never disappoints. Food is consistently very good. Desserts are always loved by all. Great portions.
5
The foods are tasty and dessert is very unique combination.
Will definitely recommend to friends and family and return next round!
4
Ordered a "duh meat board", the beef was amazing but the pork chop was disappointing being over mainated and oily..
5
Loved our dinner at Fat Lulu's. Service was excellent - Thanks Bobby for looking after our table! The menu is not extensive but it's definitely good enough for the different palates that you will probably have in your dinner party. There's seafood, different meats and vegetables. Everything is BBQ-ed though so go only if you're in the mood for some charred goodness. My favourite dish was the Ikan Bakar and we had Hamachi that night. Best BBQ fish I've ever had because it wasn't dry at all! The meat was still so juicy! If you have dinner there, you must try the desserts and the best dessert was the Ice Kacang Pineapple. A very very clever recipe. Everything worked so well together - the pineapple sorbet, the coconut ice cream and all the other little ingredients that were thrown inside that I don't know about. Must try

After a year of passing this restaurant and vowing to try it, the opportunity presented itself on a Tuesday evening. Other half and I stayed on the bus for one extra stop and turned up without a booking. Easily accommodated in the small dining room (seats approx 34), we were met with prompt attention and iced water. The menu is very mixed in food type - bit of japan meets euro meets Singapore but it all works!! Started with the homemade bread with Konbu butter - new ingredient for me but it was an amazing mouthful - unsalted butter double frozen with seaweed extract made it taste as intense as truffle with extra saltyness. The tomato and burrato salad was beautifully presented and the intensity of the tomatoes was there - reminded me of the best tomatoes I ever ate which was in italy. Didn't notice the olives but the balsamic was smooth and just tangy enough. Next up the pork satay sticks - just 5 so perfect for sharing, surprised there wasn't a sauce but the meat was moist and flavoursome. The Chef was happy to explain the dishes as he served them and the waitress was attentive. Mains included the divine bernaise covered asparagus - you just can't go wrong with anything covered in bernaise sauce! Perfect balance of butteryness with al dente asparagus pieces. Wish I knew the veg supplier - the produce was super tasty. The open face beef ravioli was good but not outstanding. And finally onto desserts - very clever ingredient combos, plated exquisitely and tasting amazing. The 'childsplay' had popping candy tucked in amongst the punchy raspberry granita and the ice cream stick packed plenty of peanut flavour - as big as a magnum but better tasting!! The other chocolate dish was intense too - yummy baileys and caramel flavours mixed. Got to bring your sweet tooth for both as they are big. Perhaps we could have gone for the Apple tarte tatin ... next time. The wine list was short but had some good options and the specials board was definitely worth a review. No dessert wine or sherry available. The bill was larger than I expected but I'm still getting used to Singapore prices and we did order plenty of dishes. We got good quality and quantity for the price. Will certainly go back, great spot for couples and groups, bit small for kids/prams. We may just have found our new regular local restaurant for when we can't be bothered to cook and want to try great flavours and produce.
4
It's a cozy space and the tables are a little too close together, but our neighbours were friendly and considerate to keep their voices down, so it worked out well.Try the Iberico pork satay with a sweet smoky aftertaste that makes you want to have another, and then another ....The porn corn was surprisingly good, esp with the tangy sauce on the side. The broccolini was deliciously crunchy with generous sea salt flakes in olive oil.The ikan bakar was fresh, juicy and done just right.Service was friendly and warm. They gave good advice on food portions and how much to order. If you need a spot off the usual busy mall-crush for good food in a relaxed atmosphere, this is the place to try. If you are dining alone, just sit at the bar counter and chat with the staff. For those who drive, there's ample parking just beside the restaurant up a small side lane, and it's free
5
My friends and I used to be here when it was still owned under Five & Dime. Since it became the Fat Lulu's, I decided to give it a try and was really happy with all the innovative food. Service is always prompt and this little spot will make you feel like coming home
4
Came here to celebrate a birthday. Loved the ambience - it was both relaxed and cosy. Food wise, the Sataytay was my personal favourite, I particularly enjoyed how it was lightly charred with a good amount of spice - it was spicy but not overwhelmingly so. The Herb-crusted Lamb Rack was tender and succulent, would have loved it they gave more! Desserts were great, especially the 'Atas Kinder Bueno', which is totally worth a try. Will definitely be back to try more dishes
5
The restaurant serves excellent sous vide pork ribs that falls off the bone. Succulent and flavourful, the pork ribs are the best that I've ever tasted so far. It might not be the traditional BBQ flavor that most are used to, the Asian twist of using kicap manis complements well with the pork. The potatoes with the mushroom paired with kale and balsamic reduction is also a delight. It is a dish with an inviting flavor, combined with a very interesting texture from the roasted kale, that made my evening even more wonderful
5
Visited this place for desserts ... was recommended the Pineapple Ice Kachang and the Warm Banana Bread & Friends by the server ... Both were awesome ... The presentation and the taste was great. The atmosphere and the friendly service also.Will go out of my way to return and try further dishes
5
Food menu and presentation are very innovative and appetizing!
The service is witty and efficient!
Love the concept and definitely value for money!
5
Absolutely flawless. Great service mouth watering dishes and deserts really finish it off with a bang! In a very happy food coma right now!! Thanks so much.
5
service, quality food love the potato gratin . slightlyheicier side. Cosy space - Great for dates or outing with friends.
4
Tomatoes with Burrata, beef ravioli and hamachi collar were all excellent dishes I would be happy to return for. Nice environment for having a meetup with friends.
4
Was offered the bartop as place was fully booked. Food was expensive but made up with attentive service from the staff.
4
Food was good, but abit on the pricey side for the quantity given. Service was good, friendly staff.
5
Visited on a Friday night and the restaurant was packed at both levels. We are the tomato salad (the tomatoes were really flavourful and the vinaigrette was delicious), grilled asparagus, cauliflower and the ribs. All the food was superb and the only regret was there was no capacity for the deserts.
3
Brought a friend from HK for dinner. The curried cauliflower was an interesting dish - quite liked it. Really enjoyed the coconut ice cream with coconut foam and pineapple ice dessert. But the main dish we ordered (if I recall correctly, some pork chop and wagyu beef served with kailan) was quite a let down - it was way too salty. Quite disappointing.
2
Pictures of food online look amazing but in real life were not even close. Steak weight must have been seriously reduced by Fat and Childhood dream desert really was an ice cream stick with some cherry sorbet - look this up online and then wait to you see the current creation. If you are going to be called a desert restaurant then make good deserts - both came out so quickly they must have been made in a hurry
5
Make sure you book so that you don't get disappointed. The menu is quite small, but try everything as it is all good. Alternatively order the platter that comes with most items on the menu. Make sure you leave room for dessert. The staff are a gem for Singapore. They actually care.
4
The food at Fat Lulu's was good and hearty and the recommendations were top notch. I especially liked the steak served on the Duh Meat Board. Only consideration is that for the price, the portions were not generous enough.
5
Delicious fusion food! We had the home made ravioli with beef which was really delicious. Other dishes which were equally good were the bursta cheese with tomatoes and cauliflower with curry powder!
5
Extremely love the beef, Kailan & pork platter we ordered! Though the portion is unexpectedly small for such tasty food! Can't get enough of it. The grilled fish is a must try. You won't regret it! I love it. Great service, great ambience, great everything!
5
We were there as a group of 6. We really enjoyed the food - shared the platter. Love the satay & ribs. Best part - the pineapple ice kachang! Nice place to hang out with friends.
4
The pork satay and grilled porn corn were stand outs. The mangalicia pork collar was very tender (it comes medium rare and is best done that way. Some of us requested it well done and it did not do it justice). The pineapple ice kachang was a great way to refresh the palate after the heat from the meats
5
Fat Lulu hasn't disappointed me yet. The food is fresh and well prepared. Aircon is a little lacking, but in general, is still a nice place for dinner with friends and family. The meat platter was solid, and the broccolini delicious! Very thoughtful and polite service as well
4
 Our first impression of the place was that its probably going to be a little pricey and perhaps overrated. How glad we were to be proven wrong when the food was served.From the perfectly cooked Ravioli on the Specials to the BBQ Pork Ribs on the standard menu, and even the ciabatta that we managed to procure from the kitchens, every dish was executed to perfection — smokey charred crust on the meats sliced to reveal a tender pink medium. The beef on the ravioli just fell apart with the slightest pressure applied with a fork. The spicy clam soup was refreshingly spicy without being overbearing and is a good accompaniment to the stronger flavours of other dishes we ordered. The servings seemed small but we were pleasantly surprised by how satisfied we felt at the end of the meal; Less is more, indeed.However, the prosecco (by the glass) was served without bubbles. It really makes one wonder how long it has been sitting in the fridge. One would also presume that the servers lack knowledge on how to serve it as the said wine came in a standard glass for reds. For their price point, I would presume that they would not sting on the glasses. The recommended red was a little too strong on the tannins, however, it was true to the request of full-bodied.Having a dessert chef who delivered ended the meal on the perfect note. We recommend the 3-course dessert tasting $35 — perfect of sharing in a group of 4, without any need to fight over the leftovers. The dessert plates were scooped clean by the ladies in the group, without a further thought to the calorie count, a clear testament to how good they were.The service was attentive yet not overbearing. Water glasses were promptly filled without requests. A great meal, definitely worth going back for
4
Over heard this restaurant from my friends, from her posts I feel like coming here just to try their signature dishes.Overall, their portion is very small for a 20++ starter, we ordered few starters and few mains. Have to mentioned that their food was creative, I love their pork ribs. With one bottle of alcohol, we ending up spent 50 per person with dessert. But I think, the restaurant is quite small, hope you can improve the interior environment the space and food portion :)
4
Five of us in total came to $600 but that included a $100 bottle of Aussie Red. We did pig out. Fish was very good. Mussels a little disappointing and lamb overly salty. Wagyu special was good but the sirloin had a particularly large piece of fat- not just the marbling you would expect. Cauliflower was great. Corn ok. Pineapple dessert Wife loved and the Apple tart was a hit with both girls. Panna Cotta was good
5
We are a bunch of ladies. I was a little worried about the possibility of a meat heavy menu at Fat Lulu's but we ended up loving everything we ordered. Sure the ribs, satay, fish were great but the cauliflower dish was delicious too. And the desserts ! I am not a dessert person but the desserts were super yummy. My fav was "childhood" - a huge ice cream concoction that reminded me of .....childhood. I am afraid after 2 bottles of wine we were talking a little bit too loudly - but it's that sort of a place. Not suitable for couples looking for intimate tête à tête.
3
Tried 3 appetisers:
burnt corn : Corn was sweet but the sauce was too sharp/sour
potatoes with mushrooms: well cooked but seasoning was off again; too salty
Satay: nicely seasoned and tasty
Kinda disappointed overall and decided to skip desserts
5
Ordered the fried curried cauliflower and sataytay and it was very flavourful! Highly recommend the satay. Got berries and chocolate and childhood for desserts and it definitely pretty decent! Love the sorbets
5
Situated in a two-story shophouse, Fat Lulu offered a decent presented yet delicious and mouthwatering dishes. Really enjoy every bites and would recommended others to try. Cheers
4
Loved the pig out platter. Very nice satay and ribs. Small restaurant but cosy. Nice beers. Good service
4
We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and love the food here. Every single dishes ordered were fantastic and the service attentive. The only downside is that it's abit inaccessible without car as it's not near to mrt station. However, it's definitely worth making a trip there
4
Went with my Son and half a dozen others for a pre stag night meal.A little disappointed when I got there as a bit smaller than I expected and consequently,being full, a bit cramped and noisy . However,I soon found out why it was fully booked - yes ,the food ! Great variety of meats - ,the herb crusted lamb rack , pork ribs and meat board all excellent ,along with a good variety of veg(especially the curried cauliflower - wonderfully different). Good selection of beers and wines as well ,and both food and wine reasonably priced for Singapore. To my mind,not the venue for a romantic meal for two,but terrific for a fun night out. Would happily go again and try out the rest of the menu
4
Enjoyed another great meal at Fat Lulu's. We ordered the cauliflower, burrata, asparagus and lamb. Apart from the asparagus which was too salty the other dishes were fab as usual. Also had the panacotta and banana bread. Both were excellent. Fat Lulu cooks with excellent ingredients and passion. Always enjoyable and need to book in advance.
4
I came here mainly enticed by the dessert, but also had the savouries. The roast potatoes and curried cauliflower were surprisingly tasty without being too oily. I also ordered the ribs - meat felt a little under barbecued and lacked that bbq fragrance and flavouring was just a thick covering of sauce. The coriander was way too overpowering on the ribs.
4
My sister and brother in law are 3 minutes from this restaurant so location was spot on. A small compact restaurant with a friendly atmosphere. My sister was looking forward to the crispy brocoli but unfortunately it was no longer on the menu. We started with tomato and burrata salad with a lovely pesto dressing and corn on the cob. For main we ordered the ribs and I ordered the Ikan Bakar spicy fish dish however there was a problem with the fish (it kept falling to pieces) so I took the grilled hamachi collar - I had no idea what it was and decided to wait until I'd eaten it before I googled it. Turns out it was yellowtail fish. We had a nice evening with good food and service ;-
2
Was there last night the service staff was a bit busy but still managed to get us our table . After carful making my way to the table i was tired . The journey to the table is like walking thru a land mine . U have to be very carful as to not knock in to anyone seated .  Upon surviving the landmine crossing we ordered the thai clams and 2 orders of the rib eye . The clams is too sour but it was fresh .  Waiting for the ribeye . I ordered medium rare and a medium . Meat is okay but the bake potatoes is a little too sour .  This restaurant had a funny design . If you are lack of space than don't put a big bar . If the bar is mend for a design look for something else . If the bar takes up too much space and you require to squeeze your customer like a can of sardine than something is wrong. Not saying that the design is bad but the bar is so big and customers have to sit so closely to the next table . I cannot seem to stay to hang out . I literally can hear my neighbour bragging about her bf .  Food is average. Adventurous but mediocre. Food is like the restaurant layout . Focus on the wrong things. Overall its a nice experience for normal days hangout not a place to impress .
5
been here twice so far, and we keep coming back. love the food, there are some mainstays in the menu, as well as some new/seasonal creations on the (chalk)board. friendly and prompt service, with a nice decor. free and ample parking as well!
3
Portions were small and choices not so great. The Sunday menu could be better. Brunch menu also meager
5
It's rare to find a place where everything we ordered exceeded our expectations. Presentation of food was great and flavours even better. Not to mention the friendly staff. Check it out!
4
Best for small groupies! Atmosphere & ambiance is amazingly cozy.Wide variety of small platters that comes with decent serving size. If you are the communal small eaters who like to have a taste of interesting fusion cuisine, do not miss out visiting Asian fusion casual restaurant. I wanted to give it a 5/5 for Fat Lulu's but because of its disappointing desserts. The latter are great for instagramming but not great in terms of taste. Lacks a distinctive "oomph" factor. We tried "Atas" Kinder Bueno,"Usimarit" and "Childhood", all prettily presented but failed to impress my group of lady friends
4
I came here with my family and the four of us ordered the Pig Out platter. Everything on the platter was pretty good, and we liked the fact that they paid attention to the vegetables as well, and the fact that there was a good assortment of meats and even fish. I enjoyed the Hamachi collar, the tomatoes and the burnt corn a lot, but the ribs were a favourite on my table. However, the burnt kai lan... the taste was too charred for my liking... Nonetheless the service was good as well. Overall, an enjoyable experience, great place for celebrations or a treat :) Will definitely be back to try their desserts
5
A fun place to go with a group of friends so you can order their special house platter that includes a little bit of everything -- grilled meats & vegetables. Add some extras (we added okra, roast potatoes, fried cauliflower and a lamb rack) and you have a feast. Arrive on time or find your table given away. People also tend to linger so if you're undecided between an earlier or later booking, go with the earlier. Our bill for six worked out to S$100 @ but the included 3 bottles of wine, which tells you it was a fun place to meet up with friends over some good food
2
2nd visit. Good food but blur waitress - despite a reservation with special request for corner table, they put us next to a big group of patrons with super loud parents and super screeching kids - impossible to enjoy the meals, don;t even think of having any conversatio
5
This is one of the best meals that I have had in Singapore. The menu is creative, and extremely well executed. We loved the vibe, the service, and the amazing food. Go in a bigger group if possible as you should try the big platter for 4 and at least three of the desserts. We also loved all the starters we had, in particular, the Burrata and Cauliflower. Plus it is good value for money
4
I would like to put a ra into of somewhere between average and good. The meat plate was yummy. The satay, slightly disappointing. The desserts were great though. They do sell themselves on that! The deconstructed ice kacang looks wonderful the way it is served. The space is pretty small and I saw them turning people away, it was a Friday night. The good news is there is quite a bit of parking at the back. Hey do tell you to go through the red gate next to the restaurant. I'd go back again, but not in the greatest hurry though
3
Located centrally at a corner alone river valley road. Limited seatings so reservation is recommended. Was a little bit upset when we were told that they were not serving their brunch menu even though recommended on chope website.The experience was saved with their famous atas kinder beuno - uniquely beautiful presentation and totally fresh and arousing to the tastebuds. Sweet tooth cravings were satisfied.
4
Came across this place by chance. Loved the open face beef ravioli and croque thambi. Desserts were great too, especially the atas kinder bueno. Worth another visit to try other stuff!
5
Great service, attentive staff, and creative presentation of food. Will come back here for desserts again.
5
AMAZING food and lovely service. Known dishes done very well and with a new/yummy twist. The desserts were to die for.
4
The food is tasty esp the burnt asparagus and the ikan. Portion was a tad too small for the price though :/
5
simply delicious. one of the best lamb and beef in town. must book in advance as place is small and always packed.
4
Just moved closer to work downtown Singapore, exploring vicinity. One block down and we turn right in through the door of Fat Lulu's. Menu and specials look nice. We start with potatoes and mushrooms grilled with lamb fat. Then Thai clams and Ribeye. Finally tarte ratings with smoked vanilla ice cream. And a pineapple coconut Kachang dessert that was smoking good. All in a nice funky environment. Families and youngsters in good mix. Friendly effective staff. 4 minutes walk to home. Great for a Friday. Happiness.
4
Got a table at the upstairs space (the brewery) without specifying it upon booking online. Was quite happy as it is more quiet, and less cramped than downstairs. But it also means you have to wait for your food/drinks to be brought up from downstairs, so be patient when the place is fully booked.Loved the food, will definitely come back and recommend it to friends
5
This is a charming place where you must book as it is small and fills up very quickly.A small menu of freshly prepared food is really enticing.The clams, ribs and curried cauliflower were all absolutely delicious served by charming staff.It also serves wonderful alcoholic Jamaican ginger beer.The desserts look fabulous but were beyond us this time.A cool ambience with great food at good prices-and good wine by the glass too.This is a place to which we will return
5
This is the one place that left me saying... I will be back to try everything else on the menu. Helmed by twp chefs - one for Asian inspired bbq dishes and the other for desserts - you get the best of both world in one place. Highly recommended.
5
Sam and his team is probably one of the most amazing and talented local culinary team in Singapore. Love their synergy of cooking a storm of yummy cuisine with simple ingredients! A must try when in Singapore!My favourites: Iberico satay, pineapple ice kacang, smoked sour cream corn, steamed short neck clams
5
Meats were done perfectly and so juicy, clams were super fresh and succulent. Must leave room for desserts, they were both pretty and insanely yummy.
5
We went without any expectations, however I now have new ( high) standards for singapore BBQ style food - based upon their wonderful food quality and service.
Everything we had was perfectly cooked and had great flavour.
We are going back next week!!
4
Food at Fat Lulu was interesting. Loved the iberico pork sataytays and the pork collar...Dessert was a hit with banana bread in brandy butterscotch sauce (nothing left of the sauce in the bowl...it was that good) and a miss with Atas Kinder Bueno.
3
Food taste average and every dish was way too salty. Dessert was good. Atmosphere was good. Price is slightly on the high side for the portion served.
5
Fat Lulu's never disappoints. The mains are great and the desserts are even better! Good service is hard to find in Singapore but the team and Fat Lulu's get my medal of good service.
3
Several items were "sold out" during dinner time at 7pm on a Sat night. The famed cider drinks were also unavailable when wanted to order. This resulted in a damper on the high expectations my wife and I had when we arrived with many of the items not available (given that the menu itself was not of wide variety in first place). Nonetheless the food we ordered came pretty quickly. Quite decent but felt slightly pricey for the value. Plated dessert was perhaps the highlight of the night. Tried the deconstructed "atas" kinder bueno which was pretty good for me. Not exactly enticed to a return visit unless something improves though
4
Go to Fat Lulu's with 4-6 people and order the main platter called Pig Out for S$198. You will get enough food to feed everyone. (you can order additional satay sticks and we also ordered the excellent ribs). The platter is a very combination of BBQ'd meats, veggies and carbos so there is a nice selection for everyone with plenty of room left over the quite good desserts. Nice casual place, a bit cramped but the atmosphere is friendly. Good wait service. All in all--a good evening out
3
Food tasted good, albeit on the pricy side. Portions will not be enough for a guy. Area is pretty crammed, seated quite closely to the next table and conversations will not be private. I went on a crowded day and the acoustics make it pretty difficult to talk. I can imagine this to be a nice place if there were less people and the tables spaced further apart.
5
Simple food executed at its best! It has been an awesome experience to diner back at Fat Lulu's for my buddies' birthday lunches. All of us had a really good time. When we feed back the potatoes were not as good as I tried before. Sam, the Head Chef and his team actually cooked another portion on their own to try and take that item off our bill. He also made them make a new batch. When it wad raining cats and dogs outside, they just asked us to relax and stay on even though they are closed for lunch service. Ben and Terence were on the floor and providing attentive service. I was particularly impressed when Ben asked a lady who is taking shelter to have a seat inside. What a gentleman!On the exquisite execution of simple food at its best with well blend of flavours! Great job Team! A must have is the iberico satay, homemade bread and butter, charred corn, steamed clams thai style! Desserts: My personal fav are the ice kacang and atas bueno bueno buono
4
We had a 5 pax reservation but could only come with 3 pax. This was no problem. Staff very friendly. Interior is cool, I liked it's casuality a lot. Menue is interesting. Would have loved to try out all. I had the regular fish menu - very tasty, though a little bit spicy for a European :-). Only discomfort, we asked for bread multiple times, kind response of the staff that yes but never was provided
3
The food was average and most of the veg was too charred. Small servings even for the platter for 4-5. Steak n pork tiny slices. Satay n grilled fish collar was the best of all. Rest was average.
Place very noisy
4
Lovely service provided along with perfectly charred bbq style food. The meats are the best, great place if you love flame grilled/ aburi style food.
5
Sam and his team (local and authentic). No pretence and quality stuff. Grill at its best. Innovative too! Just try and judge for yourselves
4
We enjoyed the pig out especially the burnt corns, beef and tomatoes. The giant crab is absolutely delicious but a pity the portion served is too small. Desserts wise we preferred the usimarit over the childhood.
5
Must try desserts.
All dishes are well executed.
Reasonably priced wines.
Wish they can do a 1-4-1 for BYOB customer with a minimum spend.
5
The ribs were delicious, the salad was interesting (in a good way), and the dessert was great. I've already recommended it to a few friends and want to go back with a group rather than with just one other person so I can try more things. My only complaint is that our bubbly was served slightly flat - though we drank it anyway
5
Fat lulu's serves yummy food, my favorite were the potatoes with lamb oil, lamb rack, pork collar and bbq pork ribs. For these I am also referring to the eaters who hate the smell of lamb meat, their lamb actually taste really good! Although the prices were on the steep side based on the portion given, they tasted delicious and it's definitely worth the price

We were here for a birthday celebration. We ordered the meat platter, skewers, and the fish. Skewers were excellent, unfortunately there was no "sambal" in the pork and it tasted pretty much like the skewers - good, but no difference almost. Fish was ridiculously salty, but the team offered to redo it - we rejected because we were kinda half done too. Desserts were ordered and the kinder Bueno was a star, albeit a bit too expensive. Overall, this place is worth a try, but don't get your expectations up

Loved the lamp rack, it was melt in your mouth and I'm still thinking about it two days after my meal. Dessert was fantastic too, we ordered the atas kinder bunoe and even thought we were very full, we were fighting to have the last bite.

We got a little too excited over the menu and ended up ordering too much food and did not manage to try the desserts. A tiny table tight restaurant, friendly staff and cozy and noisy atmosphere. We enjoyed the grilled hamachi collar the most, followed by the tuna tartar (interesting pear ice shavings!) and grilled giant crab legs (brought me back to Hokkaido). A tad disappointed with the lamb rack tho, too well done and not crispy on the outside(this is just my personal preference). I would recommend this place :

Meat was delicious; fried baby squid was crisp yet succulent on the inside; their desserts were a sophisticated blend of flavors: all delightfully tasty and sweet.

Flavourful, interesting food and unpretentious. Top on my list the Burnt Corn and Ikan Bakar, and for dessert, I recommend 'childhood'. Great selection of vegetable, seafood and meat options. A small space, so best to book ahead of time. Very talented chefs!

Too bad the place is a bit cramp maybe not that idea for big group but overall the food quality is good and we enjoy it.

Love the 'Duh Board' and burnt kailan! Desserts beautifully presented, especially enjoyed the mango lychee and apple tarte. Staff are friendly.

Loved this place! The menu was a good combination of surprising and reliable. I had a great burger with guacamole and tortilla chips, and my husband had an amazingly tasty curried omlette. Coffee was top notch as well, and the service couldn't have been better. The best brunch we've had in a while. Will definitely return

Very friendly staff and excellent Service. Food was decent and in some respect creative in its own right. Desset was surprisingly good, a must try and applause for the young creative mind behind it but again try not to do too hard and keep things simple. Too much different taste on the same mouthful complicates things at times.

We tried out Fat Lulu's and absolutely loved the menu. Eating family style we were able to sample many dishes. Stand outs for us were the spicy ribs and baby squid but the burrata was up there too. Great quality, fast, friendly service and it didn't cost an arm and a leg. Loved the shophouse location in River Valley too

Right along River Valley Road with a small exclusive car park next to it, is this unpretentious cafe with great food. I loved the croque Tambi - spicy filling in a ciabatta. Would have gone well with papadum but was served with a fruit salad. The El burger was juicy and luscious. Bacon and eggs was unique with a large slab of specially made bacon, not the slivers that are commercially available. Leave space for dessert - the pineapple coconut ice kachang was so refreshing. Service was friendly and attentive.

Great time, great food, friendly staff. My girlfriend and I were seated at the bar, where Chef Song was painstakingly preparing his desserts. He even took the time to explain each of the steps, and I was pretty fascinated by his liquid nitro tank. 10/10 would go back agai

We went there for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary and the restaurant did not disappoint. They've updated the menu and the savouries now match the desserts in inventiveness, fun and yummy quotient. Service was great and the best part is - there isn't that attitude that comes with many new, cool restaurants. If you're getting desser, get the set of three
