There is quite a lot of choice in Albert Court and the Italian cooking was very refreshing after three weeks in Thailand. good choices on the menu all cooked to order. looking forward to coming back

With so many excellent food outlets in Singapore I certainly would not recommend this one. Food was okay and no complaints but can't say much more than that
4
Nice food good beer friendly service what more do you want.
The food was reasonably priced for Singapore and somewhere to sit if you like people watching
5
Reasonable priced, varied menu, able to sit outside, service great
No complaints whatsoever, highly recommended, and would go back tomorrow

Excellent food excellent service. Thoroughly enjoyable evening would recommend it to anyone for a meal away from the hotel whilst staying in this area of Singapore.

Wonderful place though difficult to find the place as its inside the street. You should try the food here the waiter very friendly he explained about the items we wanted to order and made it easy for us to choose what we wanted to eat.

Good selection of meals, attentive and friendly staff, will attend next time I am in town for sure, good atmosphere also.

The food was good but way too expensive! there was not a single other diner in the restaurant and we stayed nearby and saw this was the case most nights. We found another mexican place a little further away but much better priced and I actually enjoyed the food there better as well so I guess if you're going to charge the higher price you need to be able to beat the competitors
4
The food was delicious, and so were the drinks, but with very few diners on what seemed to be every night we walked past this place had zero atmosphere. A real shame too because mexican food didn't seem that common and I thought it was fresh and tasty

I have only been here for drinks and snacks, but I have lost count on the number of visits I have made this trip.The barman is delightful, provides great service and he makes a mean Long Island Iced Tea...probably the best I've had.The bar snacks are delicious, but you can also have a more substantial meal if you're hungry.This place can be overlooked...after all, Singapore is about Asian and Indisn food...but if you want friendly service, cold drinks and a change of flavour i do recommend it

This restaurant serves excellent Mexican food. The guacomole and flan are out of this world, a definite must try. My only complain is the price so I would suggest ordering their daily special. Overall a great experience and would return again.
5
You have to try. Never thought I would be eating Mexican food in Singapore, but a must try. Great setting and good food. Not to mention the superb service.

Wanted some Tex-Mex and found it right next to the hotel. were able to eat outdoors and enjoyed the food and friendly service. good nachos and variety of tex-mex.

Me and my friend went for dinner,Food was fantastic n very good customer service.
Will come back again very very soon.

We stayed at a nearby hotel and were recommended to Shish Mahal by the hotel staff, but made the mistake of going to Casa Latina instead. The food was quite over-priced and hard to identify as Mexican food despite their names typically associated with such. I ordered their Poblano Relleno and what I got was an overcooked piece of what appeared to be poblano pepper covered with some cheese. I wouldn't necessarily say it was a horrible dish if it hadn't been named poblano relleno. I guess it is just a matter of managing your expectations

We've been looking for a good Mexican restaurant. The food was good. Mojitos good, one for one :-) if a little small. Nice setting in a little courtyard and even though near a man road not noisy and good to sit outside. Service friendly but as we were the only people outside not as attentive as it could have been. Tip for the management, if your mojitos are good and you have thirsty parents after a full on day with the kids, keep bringing mojitos. Our bill could have been 30% bigger if you'd seen my glass was empty a little more often. :-

The first appealing thing about Casa Latina is the service, very friendly, prompt, and smiling. We were there for dinner and drinks on a Friday evening. The Margaritas were for 1-1. I got the Peach Margarita, which was fresh and peachy and quite delicious - could've been a tad bit stronger though.We had the Nachos, Vegetable Flautas, & the Chili Relleno. The surprising thing was none of it came with salsa! The Nachos and Flautas were very average, rather dry and flavourless, though the black beans side was nice. The Chili Relleno was really good - cheesy, saucy, and delicious. The prices particularly for the portion sizes are very high. If we go back, it'll be for the Chili Relleno and the service

Right next to our lovely hotel, Albert Court! Hotel. Service was excellent, didn't get the girls name but she could not ave been nicer or more helpful. The food was delicious, kids loved it. It was a little on the pricey side for Mexican but was fresh and plentiful. Yum, thank yo

I recently stayed at the Parc Sovereign Hotel on Albert Street during a Malay/Singapore solo adventure. After a half day travelling by bus and an altercation with a Singaporean taxi driver, I didn't feel much like going out on my first evening in Singapore. Luckily just outside the hotel door is a bunch of restaurants in Albert Court. I took a chance on Casa Latina (I think it was the buy 1 get 1 free Margaritas that had me hooked) and I am so glad I did. Of course I enjoyed far too many of the 2-4-1 Margaritas, but it was the meal itself that really blew me away. The food was delicious (arguably the best Mexican I have ever tasted), and was very clearly made with a lot of care and a lot of love. If the remaining two nights of my trip weren't filled with night tours, I would have easily returned here for another meal. (I did pop in again on my last evening in Singapore for another round of 2-4-1 Margaritas before heading back to the hotel to pack - true story). The service was excellent, the food was excellent, the people were excellent, the drinks, the atmosphere, the location was all excellent. I can promise that if I ever return to Singapore that I will be visiting Casa Latina again. Thank you for the memories

To be honest, we did not expect to be eating Mexican food on our visit but as the restaurant was almost next door, we decided to give it a try.An excellent choice. Proprietors ( two brothers) are really enthusiastic and very keen to share their passion for food.We had a lovely meal, a few beers and a great chat with the owner who gave us an excellent insight into living and working in Singapor
4
According to people's review, the restaurant has great location because they located at downtown, Orchard. In addition, the staffs are friendly. The foods of restaurant have good taste, so lots of people like to eat their foods. However, the price is high for some guests.

I have been going regularly with friends. Food is authentic and huge. Portions are great. I have brought many friends over there for get-together. I have enjoyed the ambience of the place, the wide selection of food & my all time favourite melted cheese
5
This is my second visit to Casa Latina , Craving for Melted cheese and Margarita - My 2 friends first visit here find the food here is excellent specially Beef Fajita and the Braised Lamb shank .Very friendly and attentive service .
5
A great setting for some nice Mexican cuisine. The staff were exceptionally helpful in accommodating our restrictive diet. (Vegan) We recommend sitting outside as there was some live music nearby when we visited which was a nice plus.We highly recommend Casa Latina. And if you’re feeling adventuresome make sure to give the chili beer a try

Having Mexican food in Singapore is always a tricky business. A lot of times it is not very good. However, I thought this place was very good. There are tons of vegetarian options, and I had the vegetarian flatus. They also had 1 for 1 margaritas for $16, which is a good deal. The service was good as well. I would highly recommend. It's in a cute little area called Albert's Court, very near Little India

My hubby and I, and another couple enjoyed our meal here last weekend. We had a table outside, and it was great for people watching. They had fans going to keep the air moving, so we never got too warm. My raspberry margarita was fantastic, my favorite part of my meal. We shared the melted cheese appetizer, with was very delicious, and enough for the four of us to share. I had a chimichanga, it was served warm, although it didn't have much flavor. My hubby had the fajita, asked for prawns and chicken, which they made special for him. He raved about this dish, said it was the best fajita he's ever had. We all enjoyed a nice, relaxed meal, and the servers were very friendly and attentive. When we go back, I'll try the fajita… and of course a raspberry margarita!

I guess there's no point beating around the bush and I'm just saying it as it was dished to us- cold, unpleasant and rude. Maybe moving to Albert Court has something to do with this but there's really no excuse for such a deplorable experience and no one should ever be subject to it. Here are the reasons why:1. It all started with this particular waiter and let's call him X. We waited for 20 min for just ice water only to be greeted with attitude. We proceeded to ask when can you drinks arrive after this and he went to re-take our orders without so much as an apology. Please note this is retaking orders for just our drinks.2. When the drinks arrived, he then very casually said that he just wanted to ensure we got the right food and thus needed to retake orders- this time for our FOOD. this is getting ridiculous but we repeated our orders anyway- what were we supposed to do. And this was with the backdrop that the food was actually ready and he needed just to confirm that we got our orders correctly. Sure.3. When the food actually arrived- another 30 mins later, it was cold and the quesadillas were evidently soggy as it is apparent that it has been soaked in the gravy for too long. This was bordering on being disgusting and it was bland anyway. Not acceptable.4.Next the fajitas arrived- without the tortilla shells and we asked if this was right. X said that it was and was just lacking condiments which he will return with. Not only did he not return with said condiments, we had to get confirmation from his boss that the fajitas were indeed incomplete and what X said was blatantly inaccurate. He didn't even make the effort to check if what he said was right- another no no.5. So at this point all 4 of us were pretty disturbed by the experience we had so far and thus proceeded to give our feedback to the boss/manager. He took it pretty well but later X came out and realised we were giving feedback to his boss and said snide remarks like "Yes the customer is ALWAYS right". I leave you to imagine what tone he adopted. Sarcasm is really the last thing we need at this point. And the kicker is this- when we were just about to go after paying, X proceeded to chastise us (I don't use the word chastise lightly) about how we should have given him feedback about him directly and not gone behind his back to his boss, and that we should have been more polite to him etc. I don't think I have to editorize this and I again can leave you to imagine what a state of horror that left us in. If we didn't just proceed to walk off, I'm sure X would have resorted to some form of violence to make his point known.All in all, this has been a horrible dining experience and I hope X is censured in some form because he really is not doing the restaurant any service by doing what he did. The food ain't spectacular either. So be warned if you are thinking of dining here

I went to eat a couple of hours ago to Casa Latina, my comments:Pros-Good Mexican food. Nothing weird, Asian created to satisfied local tastes, it was 'mexican food'. We had enchiladas, flautas, burritos and margaritas and they were just as the ones my Mexican friends have cooked for me. -Good taste and quantity.-Well decorated restaurant, with good latin BGM. -The waiter knew how the explain the menus and had a friendly smile all the time.-Very close to Little India arcade.Cons-2 waiters to attend the whole restaurant, plus the manager or owner I am not sure.Our order took some time and when we needed something extra it took more than normal to get their attention.-No bathroom in the restaurant, you have to go to the next hotel's to fo your thing

We came early at 6 pm after visiting the museum on a Wednesday night. We were the only customers, one other couple showed up around 7 pm. Maybe the place gets going later at night but it's always a turn off when a restaurant does not have any buzz.Margarita pitcher discounted by $10 at happy hour. It was OK, nothing special.Free tortilla chips with salsa was the first sign that things were not right here. The chips were very stale. I mentioned this to the waiter who said 'Oh..." then went on with what he was doing. I guess because the place is not busy, they are recycling old chips. Bad move. In addition, the serving size was so small it made you wonder why they bothered.The melted cheese was good and something I hadn't tried before. This came in a sizzling bowl that melted the cheese into a green sauce right at the table. The tamales were average at best. I asked for some jalapenos and the waiter suggested roasted ones. These came in a broth with onions. They were spicy hot and good. Rolling the peppers into the tortilla with the melted cheese was the highlight of this dining experience.We then shared the Shrimp Fajitas. The vegetables were OK. The shrimp were not. They were either frozen ones or because they don't get much traffic, they were not fresh. On top of this they were overcooked which made them dry and hard.The reviews suggested this place had authentic Mexican. We either ordered the wrong dishes or this is just one more example of how Singapore can't get Mexican right..

A friend introduce the restaurant , food was great specially melted cheese and Divorced chicken . Very good service and attentive.

This is an interesting place that is tugged away at downtown Orchard. It is a heritage house that is pleasantly host the Mexican restaurant. The food was also interesting and authentic Mexican food that is quite difficult to find in Singapore. Having lived at North America for several decades, my wife and I enjoyed the Mexican food at Casa Latina and it was a good experience. The melted cheese was something new and something different to taste. As a vegetarian, I was surprised to see several vegetarian dishes. The vegetarian Enchiladas was really delicious with the right amount of beans and Mexican rice. My wife decided to try the Camarons Al Tequila Casa Grande which prawns cooked tequila, which she did not regret. The drinks were quite nice as we had the flavored mango margarita. The chocolate tamale as dessert completed the good dinner. Overall the heritage house, decent service, and good food made the night a good experience. We will go back to Casa Latina

I've never been served a margarita in a fruit juice glass costing me $18. Welcome to Casa Latina. We went here due to a review on Lady Iron Chef, we should have read the review was dated 2011. If you are a local, you will never go here- Margaritas at Dempsey, SeÃ±or Taco at Chijmes and Lucha Loco at Duxton are far far superior. The service was prompt and warm. The drinks were a compete let down- in size and taste. If a Mexican bar can't give your a good margarita, there's no point going there. The nachos and salsa first helping we're on the house and second was not, but it didn't have any customization. It was like you opened Doritos and canned salsa. We cancelled our main course after this experience and proceeded to Chijmes. There were only 2 other tables occupied on a Friday night. And while I did want to give it some business, the ambience was a let down, and the food was stupidly priced for the quality. Avoid

Casa Latina is tucked away in Waterloo Road and I've been there on three occasions while staying at various times in Singapore. The food is very good and done with style, not your average stodgy mexican fare. The outside seating has great atmosphere and there's plenty of cover in case the heavens open. There's also a nice sofa seating area for pre and post dinner drinks. The people I've been with, Singaporean locals, have also been impressed

The food was just okay, but still pricy. The guacamole came in a tiny dish, so we had about two bites each. Fajitas and carnitas were good, but expensive for what they are. Wasn't crazy about tortillas-- they had a bitter taste for some reason-- and there were no tacos on the menu. NO TACOS

Mexican restaurants can be hit and miss. Not so in this case. The Casa Latina is a little out of the way (though not far off Orchard Road). The restaurant has a very pleasant outside seating area as well as an indoor area. The service is attentive, gentle and very courteus. We ordered the nachos and the Latino salad. Both made decent size starters or good for sharing. For main course we shared the chicken fajita. The meat was tender and tasty. Though I am used to the plate being served sizzling at the table. The guacamole was perfect. Overall, a good place for dinner with friends

A friend brought me here. Not quite what you expect to find in Singapore. The food was good and the portions were generous. Some of the menu appeared to be more fusion than the real deal, but that is to be expected. The service was great with the staff ready to act at a moment's notice without being intrusive.My only issue is the price. It seemed a tad expensive for what it was. Otherwise it is a good place to bring guests for something different (for Singapore

I just ate at Casa Latina today and having lived in Texas before, this is by far the worst Mexican meal I've ever had. We asked for beef fajitas, something you would expect to come to the table sizzling with heat. Not only the meat was only slightly warm, but it was dry, full of fat and nerve, and the taste was awful. There was more fat than actual meat and no seasonings. It tasted as if the meat had been cooked before and just left on the shelf for hours, which I am sure was the case. We were starving from walking around the museum the whole day, so we had the tortillas only with vegetables. In addition, prices for dishes at Casa Latina are a bit on the pricey side for Mexican food, but I wouldn't have minded if the food quality had been high as well. For all this, I am quite skeptical about the few good reviews here

I live in nearby Phuket, which also has Mexican restaurants like Singapore, but they are barely adequate. But when I saw their Website and menu online, I knew that this was the real thing. And it's true - they have a Mexican chef (Mexican in Singapore?), and he prepares really delicious food. And real marguaritas, like in Mexico. It's been ages since I've had a chile relleno, and here it was - scrumptuous! There is an outdoor patio, and a cool indoor restaurant with Mexican music.Highly recommended. Remember that happy hour is over at 7, so go there before for your drinks

This was better that I expected, but not really worth $125 for the two of us. Chips and salsa: great, raised expectations!Margaritas: pretty awful. Tasted like pure mix. The second margarita made with top shelf tequila was no better, but extra expensive ($25 or more, can't remember).Queso Fundido: not badDivorced Chicken: the green mole was good, the traditional mole was okayTequila Shrimp: pretty mild, but not badIf you go I recommend drinking wine or beer as the cocktails leave a lot to be desired
