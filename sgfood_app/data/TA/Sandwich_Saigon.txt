Quite authentic Vietnamese pho and sandwiches. Reasonable prices and the tight seating makes the ambience quite authentic as well.
3
The sandwiches are quite good especially the bread which is crispy and soft.The prices are on the high side because of the location,Katong .

I visited this little cafÃ© on a two day stop in Singapore whilst travelling to Australia. You will find it on the road down to Chinatown from Clarke Quay. I happened upon it by chance on the first evening, whilst I was strolling around getting my bearings. Singapore is a lively and vibrant place with lots of interesting places to eat, and the area of Clarke Quay is one of these. It is however, pretty expensive. You will pay Â£7 for a pint of beer up to 9pm, when it goes up to Â£10 a pint. The food is not quite so severe, but it will pay you to shop around for more 'street food' kind of places, and this superb little cafÃ© is one example. The cafÃ© is run by a couple, and serves classic Vietnamese food like Pho's and dried noodle dishes. It is very clean, the service is efficient, and the staff are really friendly. They bake their own baguettes on the premises, if that is the option you'd prefer, but I went for a starter of spicy chicken wings, and a dried noodle dish, with a bottle of beer. It was all piping hot and delicious. When you order at the counter you will be given a little disc which is actually a pager. It will illuminate when your food is ready and you can go and collect it. My whole meal including the beer came to $18 SD which is just over Â£11, and was probably one of the nicest things I ate during my stay in Singapore. I would highly recommend you try it out. Great little place!

Being one of the few places that remained open at 10:30pm, and having hungry kids, we tried this place. Offered simple food and portion was quite small, but price was big for the standard and size of food offered. Fried chicken wings were soft. Chicken sandwich was plain. Wifi was free but did not work unfortunately (this is small issue).
4
The Vietnamese here is authentic, with home made fish sauce and beef that is not over cooked. The tea and blueberry yogurt were quite perfect. Despite its name it doe not just offer sandwiches (even though the baguette was excellent) but great pho and other Vietnamese cuisine

This is a small family run place in East coast area, but as well organised as Nam Nam in terms of service. However, there are some yummy treats here too.I tried , the pork chop vietnamese baguette, i have to say it tasty. The baguette is lightly toasted and the pork chop is not dry. In a package is very nice.We also had the fresh spring roll and Pho. The spring roll is fresh and nice. so not complains.However, I do have to agrees with other reviewer that the beef is tough. Not as tender as other Vietnamese Pho place. The soup is ok in my view, but , it not hot enough. Thus making the overall pho experience not very good.I have to say that the drink is a bit expensive.I would go there again for the Sandwhich and maybe try the broken rice set, but I would not be buying any drinks from there

Often visit this Neighbourhood spot in a great location opposite i12 mall. Great value for money and a good atmosphere inside the small dining area. Also have some seating outdoors at busy times.Normally have the banh mi which are very good. Number 101 Saigon special with pork, ham and add pate is very tasty.Good if you are in the East Coast area and fancying some banh mi.I would say nam nam in Raffles City and a few other locations is ever so slightly better

We've frequently had Bibimbap Korean style, which has a soup combination. We both had the pork variety last night (#204). It has very fresh ingredients, the egg is fully cooked and the rice is not crusty on the bottom. I had a mango yoghurt drink and t was good. We both enjoyed our dinner. Vern enjoyed the dried pork more than I did. The ordering process is simple and you get a ringer for when your order is ready. Tables are cleared immediately so everyone has a place. Get your own eating utensils and bring your tissues like you would in a food court

Sandwich Saigon in East Coast Road has one of the best Vietnamese Sandwich. Their offer food are not so good.
2
Really disappointing pho - quality of meat very poor and the broth lacks the depth of flavour you expect from good pho. There are better choices on Joo Chiat so wont come back.
3
Come here for their Banh Mi. The Pho gravy is a bit too sweet and herbal. The beef even though its the rare beef cost extra is a little tough. Volume is there and 2 persons could easily share a bowl but for taste its average overall. The Banh Mi on the hand is great
3
the bread is phenomenal even if you don't have a sandwich get a toasted baguette. The special Saigon with pate is not bad but nothing amazing. It's expensive cost us $25 for 2x sandwiches and 2x coke zero , there are cheaper eats along east coast road but still this wasn't too bad, just a little soggy for my liking and not that flavorsome but still not bad at all
5
This small self service cafe serve one of the best beef pho and sandwich, generous portion, prepare by Vietnamese chef. Better to order the Rare beef pho than beef pho. My partner ordered chicken pho and it taste just as good. The soup is so delicious that we finish all. Their pork chop sandwich another thumb up
3
I had the Vietnamese style sandwich with beef. The French roll was awesome, and it was overall pretty good. The beef was (they said) German. Sliced very thin, it's more a beef-and-vegetable salad. Another customer had Pho (Vietnamese noodle soup), and complained that the (Australian) beef was tough and inedible

We live near to Sandwich Saigon and go there quite regularly for a spot of lunch. It is in a great spot along a row of shophouses on East Coast road.My favourite is the "Saigon Special with Pate" sandwich which is the classic Banh Mi. It is tasty, the baguette is really fresh.Another good dish is the Chicken Noodle Pho which is a good size amount of soup if you are hungry.To quench the thirst it is nice that they do beer, lemongrass drinks and Vietnam coffee here as well, with or without the condensed milk.All in all, good quality, affordable nosh

Been craving for real banh mi since returning to Singapore from Saigon, and here it is! Probably the best in the whole Joo Chiat area (which has become a little Saigon), since I tired most of them. Go for the first on the list, their speciality. Only difference is that the Banh Mi here is not as spicy, probably to suit the locals and expats living in the area.

We popped in for a quick lunch as a family of 4 on holidays staying at the nearby Mercure.The Vietnamese baguettes were tasty and very fresh and crunchy. A little pricey but didn't disappoint.No credit card facilities though for a 10% surcharge will take you next door to use their machine

Love the Bahn My and love the little set up :) I love sandwiches (and they're not easy to find), so when I want to grab a quick weekend sandwich between laundry and cleaning, this is where I go. I need to learn how to make a good Bahn My on my own someday
2
Was hopeful I had found my go to place for cravings of Vietnamese food in Singapore but sadly this place disappointed. The banh mi Saigon Special was tasteless and far from special.
4
A bit small in size but very tasty!
I ordered the smoked chicken very nice only $7 but I may need another!
Free wifi and aircon! Nice and clean in a beautiful road that has kept the traditional architecture.

I have patronized this restaurant for years cos I loved its pork chop rice, bread among all the other items. However, during my past few visits, I noticed that the quality was well as the quality of the food had gone down. The portion of my pork was pathetic and oily. After this visit, I am not sure if I will return anymore since I have given them enough chances to improve but they keep on disappointing me
5
The quality of food at Sandwich Saigon is fantastic. Though they can get a little busy on the weekends, their in-house made fresh baguettes and delicious pho are hard to beat!My personal favourite is their Tofu/mushroom fresh spring rolls and if you haven't seen their next door restaurant, with the upstairs bar - it's fantastic for group gatherings.I'm thankful they are just down the road, because they are awesome!

I cannot agree more with GT. I just returned from there. I ordered the Saigon Special (or similar name). For 7 dollars I got a dry piece of baguette with 2 ridiculous slices of ham and 2 tiny slices of pork belly topped with about a 1/2 of grated carrot. What a rip off! I totally regret that I didn't have a camera on me to share that sad piece of "sandwich" with you

My wife and I popped in here for a light lunch, having eaten here on our last trip to Singapore a year ago. We had spicy tuna baguettes, washed down with ABCs. Everything was to our liking. The place was twice the size it was last year, suggesting that it is proving very popular
5
Small, family style, fast service, reliable, delicious! Dry noodle with garlic chicken and their spring rolls both fried and fresh are the best! I could have it every day.. Pho is delicious. Even orange juice is freshly squeezed, small details that could change my whole view of a restaurant. Very affordable and friendly patrons that make us just want to keep coming back

This place was recommended by my hosts who reside in Singapore. I was not disappointed, the service was quick and friendly. The sandwich was fresh, hot and tasty, it was the Pork Chop option on the menu. I will be going back for the Pho (Feu)
5
The restaurant is very low key and you order food from the counter and pay there. the staff are very friendly and helpful and the Pho, fresh spring rolls and fried spring rolls are the best we have eaten outside of Vietnam and the the Pho was probably the best we have eaten compared with multiple places we have eaten in Vietnam.The prices are very competitive and the quality of the food is great, they sell vietnamese beer and a good selection of other drinks

Stopped in to grab a late night dinner. Ordered the pork bahn mi with pate. This is an excellent bahn mi - the bread really makes it sing!Also ordered summer rolls with shrimp. They were only so-so; not a lot of flavor to be found. I was a bit annoyed to find that I couldn't use my Visa card. They only take NETS or cash. NETS seems to be some credit card syndicate in SG. I paid cash and it wasn't a big problem, just inconvenient.Based on the bahn mi alone, I would give this shop another try
5
Great for a quick lunch with plenty of options. Baguettes are obviously homemade and tasty, service is friendly and prices are reasonable.

If you've eaten bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ in Vietnam, you'll instantly recognise this place as the inauthentic sham and scam that it is.The bÃ¡nh mÃ¬ is very small abd has view ingredients. The extra topings (paid) are added in such small amounts as to be invisible. $1.80 for about a gram of pate' and $1.00 for an indicernably small oily substance supposed to be cheese.The staff are rude, obnoxious and try to cover up with blatant lies that they are fleecing customers.Avoid this fraudulent scam
5
It's quite hard to find real authentic food outside Vietnam but Saigon sandwich manage to do just that. They are specialising in baguettes which I don't eat due to gluten intolerance but their fresh spring rolls or pho are absolutely fantastic! I haven't had better outside Vietnam. I think for Singapore it's priced very reasonably. Highly recommende

The manager is Vietnamese and her mother provided many of the recipes at this authentic Vietnamese restaurant. Their specialty is Vietnamese baguettes (bÃ¡nh mÃ¬) which they bake daily for freshness. My favourite lunch dish is the pork meatball sandwich, but their noodles are also good and they have rice dishes too
4
The Saigon Special with pate @ $9 isn't cheap but still worth every dollar given the freshly baked baguettes (perfect Vietnamese-style texture, crisp on the outside and light inside) and authentic filling. Best I've found outside Vietnam, with the added bonus of a clean air-conditioned cafe to sit in. The pho is average imho (but I'm a pho snob) - the banh mi's the star here
5
Popped into Sandwich Saigon for a light lunch. We opted for the Spicy Tuna Baguette, a Detox juice and a Saigon beer. The baguettes were the best we have tasted since we lived in France. The spicy tuna was plentiful and delicious ! Very good value for money

It's the simple things in life that are often the best; Sandwich Saigon is one of those places. Blink and you could miss it, it's a small cafe style restaurant jammed in between others, but it's clean and tasty. I found sandwich Saigon on TripAdvisor when I was looking to find a place that made Banh Mi close by to my hotel and found this was an easy walk away; I ordered the Shanghai Surprise with pate and enjoyed it so much I went back next day for two more - takeaway this time (and my partner took so long at his meeting I ate his too!). I didn't get around to trying the Pho, but will definitely make a point of doing so next time. Don't sit down at Sandwich Saigon until you've ordered near the kitchen - it's self serve. And go around 2, if you'd like to avoid the rush! Loved it
4
Every time I happen to be in the vicinity, I will not fail to drop by for at least a coffee and a baguette. simple, no-frills place that serves fresh and great food. Love the baguettes, crisp and warm on the outside and chewy soft on the inside. Never fails! Reasonably priced fare. Worth the visit
3
The restaurant is clean and cool, but a bit cramped. We had two banh mi and a plate of prawn rolls.The banh mi bread is warm and crispy, the filling is nice enough, but unfortunately (for the shop), I have tried banh mi in Vietnam *and* Australia so that even at current prices, the banh mi at this place is more expensive than those in Sydney. Even the Vietnamese coffee is quite stiffly priced.I attribute this to the location, which unfortunately has given rise to expensive food along this relatively old world stretch of road.Still, it's worth a try

First time with my friend when we sat at the table did not know it was a self service joint. There was no sign to inform the customer to place orders at the counter which was hidden from our table. Had to pay in advance for the food. Noticed the price list in the menu are about 20 -30% more expensive than those vietnamese restaurants at Joo Chiat area which have staffs taking orders and serving. We order the meatball & pork chop baguette it taste great. They should include french fries with the baguette. There were no cutleries on the table everything we had to get ourselves from the counter. The price should reduced to match those other vietnamese restaurants in that area.Thet
