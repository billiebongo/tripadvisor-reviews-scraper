Overall the food is good spread and the quality of food is consistent. Attentivr service. Desserts has got good spread.
2
The price didnt match from the post you. posted. and price too expensive.. the ambience is too dark.. limited to choose food also
2
Only a few items were of acceptable quality. The cold seafood and sashimi were not very fresh, bbq was limited and whatever was available was severely over cooked, the ice kachang dessert station looked like it came from the previous century.
5
The buffet taste is great with fresh seafood and the replenish of the chilli crab is almost instant! No tray is left empty for more than 5min.
4
The food are fresh, not first visit here. But this time round the service staffs were lack of attendtion maybe is because of their too many customers during on the new year even night.
4
A sumptuous breakfast each morning with western and eastern food choices. Busy place. Great staff on duty.
1
They cleared the plate pretty fast.The BBQ is badly done most the items are burnt.Even I took some ribs it is also very burnt.The music seems to be repeated over and over.There is really nothing that really got my palate.will not be coming back again.

Had buffet dinner at the cafe recently. I consider the buffet to be expensive relative to the quality and the range of food provided as it cost more than $75 per pax. If you do not have a big appetite, it may be better to go for the alacarte menu. That said, the cold seafood such as steamed prawns and crabs are fresh and the durian pengat is nice

With so many dining promotion going on now for Christmas feast, I think CafÃ© 2000 must step up to match their competition. Otherwise it is a budget buffet with 40% on eatigo app. With the discount, it cost $ 50 per pax. I sincerely hope none of the guests pays a full price for this dinner. This is such a small buffet spread. If you have a budget for S$ 60 or $70 there are a lot much better choices at other hotels. However if your budget is only $ 50, then you make do with this budget buffet and don't complain like I am whining here. We would have gladly pay a bit more for better quality food.The hot dishes are served in pots. Pepper crabs, beef stew, orange duck, sweet and sour pork, lamb soup. There are a few deep fried items like chicken and also satay (this is good). We had to wait for the oysters, pepper crabs etc for a long time. Basically if you check on the oysters 2x and there were none, you really wont check a 3rd time. They even ran out of cream brulee and did not replenish it. There was also a whole Turkey and honey ham which we thought was decoration props which turned out to be real! The whole night - it was not cut or being served. This was kind of funny. On the staff - they were great! They got us hot tea and refilled with hot water. Such as dear....so they deserve an extra star. Providing a genuine review, I guess we will not return again
4
Like ribs, they have it and the meats falls off the bone. Steam fish, satay even with crushed pineapple,durian penggat, seafood bbq on weekends. The roast beef, they will cook to your preference. Best time to visit is dinner on weekends where they have all of the above and finish off with ice crea
4
The place is small due to the close proximity of tables/chairs but quite happening and crowded. Breakfast is a must here especially if you are staying at the Hotel. They have a good menu for the Winers/Diners.
3
Hotel buffet normally quite expensive but we bought Seafood Lunch Buffet at a good price with unlimited chili crab and some seafood. Generally food are good especially roasted beef. The pasta and sushi area doesn't seems interesting so we skipped. Desserts are normal.
1
Food quality not equal with the price. Buffet style, but they don't refill Alaska crab and chilli crab serve very slow. Everything taste so so. Will not return anyway.
5
Large variety of food. Cold crab, prawns, oysters and mussels for cold dish, BBQ beef, ribs, sausages too.

Whenever it's a Holiday or a Special occasion Me & my family always prefer to have a good dining experience-- good food & good customer service! And one of my favorites is Cafe 2000. I really like how they serve us with a genuine smile and kind gestures especially these two persons, I remembered their names, PRINCESS KAYE & MINNIE. They are so attentive to us! You should look for them. From the entrance Minnie was so sweet and accommodating! It changes my mood, then when we came in, Princess Kaye assisted us pleasantly to our table, from there, the feeling of being served & welcomed was really refreshing. Princess made a good impression to us especially she was visible and attentive on our small request while we were dining. We all appreciate the Good Food!! (All nicely done & delicious btw!) and the Good service that we've all experienced! We will be coming back definitely! worth the money!
5
Had our lunch buffet here in Cafe2000 for my early birthday celebration. I like the food but more than that, the service is great. staff are really friendly, Princess and Minnie (korean) gave me a complimentary cake. Princess is very accommodating and we really had a wonderful time. Stay jolly guys! Keep up the good work..
4
The option for the food in the buffet is not too many compare to the price, however all the food taste good especially the desert! Strongly recommend! DIY ice cream made my kids very happy. Anyway it is nice experience for family party, wish to have more food choice in future
5
As part of my stay in M Hotel, my breakfast was in Cafe 2000... must admit, the staff was super efficient... they cleared tables, managed people, refilled food with swift speed..the hotel was full during my stay and hence the Cafe was crowded but these guys should be lauded...the food selection was nice, it was quite filling...non-veg section can be elevated a bit...the bakery section had some good options..
5
Went to lunch at Cafe 2000 with my colleagues. The set lunch includes a buffet line of soup, bread, fruits and desserts. My colleagues ordered Fish n Chips, Steak, Lobster Hor Fun etc which were all delicious. My favorite dish was the ***Cod fish served with goose liver and asparagus***. All of us were impressed by their high food standard, fantastic service and beautiful food presentation. Thank you all the friendly staff including Saja, Wati, Min Hee and Amy who made our lunch even more enjoyable! I will definitely recommend Cafe 2000 to friends and family. Im sure they will like the cafe too :
5
It was my first time at Cafe2000 and needless to say, I've an amazing time there. The food was great and so was service provided by the staffs, especially Firuz and Sara. They were really helpful and approachable. They made our experience a pleasant one. I would definitely come again and recommend Cafe2000 to others! Keep up the good service!
3
2nd visit after a year, not many food varieties. The BBQ seafood was not that fantastic. Reservation made thru eatigo with 40% off for a weekend dinner. So reasonable price. However, hotel does not offer parking coupon for dine in customer except for hotel members.
2
Dissapointing dinner buffet with limited selection of food. Only salmon n hamachi sashimi available. Also food was not replenished with seafood selection left with empty plates as early as 7pm.
4
Good and affordable Executive Lunch that comes with a nice spread of self-service desserts that includes durian pudding. Staff were friendly and helpful. Keep up the good work. Maybe hotel should consider providing free wi-fi to restaurant guests too.
4
Friendly staff and innovative food selection. Location is good specially when you stay in the M hotel. there are other hotels around as well and location is high class business area.
5
Went first time to have buffer dinner with my company. Price was abit steep but the experience followed suit. It was worth the price to pay. Good food, nice setting, enough for our group of 7 pax. Have to mention stand out service from Firus and Sarah. They attentive all night, good recommendations, made us feel very important the whole time
4
Came here for dinner, but not buffet. Service was slow, but most of the food was good. We had satay, which came with a nice pineapple relish. The peanut sauce was also good, spicy, but good. The noodle dishes were all very delicious and the laksa was maybe one of my favorites. My cousin ordered a salmon pizza... haha apparently it was good.
5
Buffet dinner was good ith lots of tasty seafood and meat.it was very crowded but we were very impressed with Princess and Suja's hospitality and warmth,they managed the crowd very well.one customer broke a bottle of red wine and they managed the situation well.Keep up the good work & smile always
4
Celebrated Father's Day with my family here with Maybank card buy 2 get 1 free promotion. Seafood (mussels, prawns and oysters, crabs, small lobsters) and sashimi (salmon and tuna) is very fresh! Laksa comes with many seafood toppings (squid etc) and the taste is authentic. Highlight of dessert is durian purÃ©e (delicious) and chocolate fondue with star fruits (surprise)! Satay is tender and aromatic. Roasts are yummy too! Suggestion: add a fried rice in addition to the carb selection (some of the dishes go better with rice than bee hoon)Staff is very polite and accommodating. They pay attention to children's needs and safety when clearing the plates. Cafe is not big, remember to book early for large group seating to avoid disappointment. Parking coupons not provided but you may try your luck asking the friendly staff for one!
4
I celebrated Mothers' Day at Cafe 2000 last night (10 May 2017). Cafe staff, Princess (What an apt name for her!) attended to me and my family. She was so helpful in keeping my family comfortable, so were the rest of the staff. There were 11 of us and we all enjoyed ourselves very much. Despite a smaller floor area, the food was good and enough to cater all of us. The staff were attentive to us, clearing our used cutlery promptly and chefs replenish food in time for more hungry eaters. The crab selection was really wide. So were the desserts at the dessert section. Staff Princess and her group of colleagues made us feel like Queens and Kings. We enjoyed so much that we told ourselves we will come back for more. Thank you for rendering an unforgettable evening of gathering and celebration for my busy family. Keep up the good work and smile always
4
We were staying close by and wanted to grab some takeaway for an early dinner. It was Good Friday so not a lot was open. They accommodated our order so well and the service was fantastic. The pizzas were yummy and we were really grateful to find something so close to where we were staying as it was raining.
3
A buffet with a mix of local and western food - does not differentiate apart from it is on the expensive side
5
We enjoyed the buffet breakfast at the Cafe 2000 restaurant when we stayed at the M Hotel. Good range of breakfast items.
5
Was there for a business lunch.
The food was great. Salad and dessert were buffet-style. There was a great variety of choices for the salad buffet.
The main course was great.
Service was fast and great.
Will visit again!
4
Went here as it was included in the hotel price for breakfast. Good spread of asian and western food - I really liked the egg station (cooked to order). The only downside was the coffee which was from a machine and was not very good. Good for included in hotel price but I probably wouldn't pay to have breakfast here
3
On my first night at the M Hotel, I couldn't be bothered to go far, so tried the Cafe2000 buffet. It was fairly indifferent - a reasonable range of Asian & some European food, but nothing exciting. The tables are very close together, so walking to and from the buffet is difficult. It's not particularly good value, either. There are much better places a short walk away.
4
International Buffet. . A group of 7 arrived at 12pm for lunch buffet. No one was there so we walked in and seated ourselves. It was full house maybe due to promotion. Cooked food section was good especially the Fried Fish with longan & tomato sauce. The other cooked food are good as well. The seafood section is ok, prawns are very fresh. Crabs are abit not so fresh in my opinion. The Chilli Crab quality was average too. Laksa is very tasty. Salmon & Tuna Sashimi is available too, not bad, can be better. The Desserts are ok, there is durian puree for those who like this. Free flow of coffee, tea & drinks. Waiters are quick to clear the plates so i like this. Abit warm at the place we are sitting, ice cream is actually melting , not sure why though. Overall, a good deal for the promo price that we are paying
5
You can eat basically everything in this restaurant, and you will feel strangely good about it. :) There is a wide variety of food, from oysters to steak, dumplings to nasi lemak, chinese dumplings and pasta, and so on. Several options for dessert too, fruits, cakes, sweets and ice cream. I had dinner there and it was simply amazing
5
Was there having buffet dinner on the 18 Dec to celebrate my son's 21st birthday. All the staff was very friendly and helpful. The buffet spread was quite ok as you can't compare to other hotels as their space was not so big. Food was delicious and the oysters & other raw foods was fresh
5
Our company had a year-end dinner here last week. We were very much satisfied with the buffet spread. The selection was too much even for big appetites. Fresh cold seafood of prawns and crabs are perfect starters. Grill station offers beef, pork, chicken and crustaceans for the healthier choice of grilling.Carving station has steak and turkey, while different greens, dressings and cheese make up the salad bar. Dessert table includes pastries and cakes, and another area offers ice kachang, as well as different ice cream flavors.Cafe2000 won't disappoint at all. Can't wait for the next chance to come back.
5
I was there on a few occasions. The best was whenI had the buffet dinner with a couple of girlfriends and the Alaskan Crab which is hard to get at any buffets are delicious! I was lucky also that they had durian!!! for the price you pay, the service and food is worth having
4
We enjoyed buffet breakfast at restaurant. A good variety of breakfast food. Egg station is a bonus. Fresh fruit is available, together with hot selection. Pricing is reasonable for the food and variety.
4
The crab buffet was really good. Especially the steamed mud crabs. Cempedak log cake was the best. Durian Mousse was good too. BBQ was soso.
5
We had breakfast and à buffet lunch at café 2000. Breakfast was great with adequate choices. The lunch was very good, especially the Chili crab was excellent. Further lots of choices.
2
on 29th july 2016,i purchase more than 16 dinner buffet voucher from groupon,it was a weekend bbq dinner but I found the food overall was poor,oyster was not generously given out and the bbq foods was burnt which u can taste the burning taste,it was a bad experience having the dinner ther
3
We stayed at the M Hotel with buffet breakfasts included. There was a very good selection of western and eastern dishes, and excellent espresso coffee.We got a shock when we had tea there one afternoon, as a small pot of tea made with a tea bag cost $9
3
The variety of food was reasonable.. Nothing to be wowed about but the crab are all overcooked.. The bbq food was all burnt.. Pork knuckle is nice.. It took a while for them to replenish the food though the food is finished... When first go in, I requested for a stool to put my bag but the staff told me full house.. After that we requested to change table that is at the corner so I can hang my bag on the chair and the staff reluctantly allow us to change and his face turned black.. The place seems quite warm as the air con not cold enough... First time eat in a hotel restaurant and we keep perspiring.
4
I called up to check on the pricing beforehand and the staff told me was $90+ so I decided to get the groupon deals at $60+ per pax instead. However when I went down for the dinner, I found out that the pricing was actually the same as the groupon deals. Anyway it was a BBQ night on Friday so we had a taste of the BBQ. Had fish, prawns, lobsters and otak, overall quite good. Food were replenished quite frequently. Staff very fast in clearing our plates. Overall good experience

Lets talk about what I enjoy the most first. 1) The oyster. Yes, one of the best oyster in majority of buffet restaurant in Singapore, its fresh, its big, it goes well with a light squeeze of lemon, or with Tabasco sauce. 2) Roast Beef (Do not confuse this with BBQ beef steak). The roast beer is slice only when you order it over the counter, and prepare it by putting on the grill for around 10 seconds a side, serve warm, and with many condiments for you to choose from. 3) Service was pretty good, nuff said.4) Chicken Satay were tender, juicy. Pretty good!Now, the not so pleasant side.1) The cold seafood such as lobster, prawns, and crab claw were disappointing. I have never tasted such blend seafood before.2) Let's talk about BBQ seafood now. WOW! It has no taste at all! It is my first time tasting tasteless bbq seafood! Job well done, must have broken some kind of world record here.3) The bbq beef was way too well done, I could throw that piece of steak at someone and that would send him to the hospital. There were no seasoning as well, pretty bad.4) We were serve Menu 1 out of the 3 menu that were on rotation, but since it pretty much has the same food item, nothing gonna change much. The chili crab were a-okay. Sauce was not bad, but the crab wasn't as fresh. Maybe I got the bad one, maybe not.5) For the original price of SGD $90 over dollars per person, only ice lemon tea and ice water were available? Come on, you can do better than that.6) I save the best for the last. Many reviews say that the durian mousse was fabulous, tasty, delicious! Bull crap that is. First of all, I have not seen a mousse serve in solid state. How do Cafe2000 wants me to eat it?Luckily, there is a decorating candle on the dinning table, so I thaw the durian mousse over it, refer to the picture I attach. 7) There were no space for much movement at the food serving area, sooooo be careful of any hot food coming your way
5
The quality of the food is normal. However, the service is fantastic! They clear the table very fast and buffet area is very clean. The staff are very friendly and polite. They can assist you with the credit card promotions when you ask for the bill! You can save some from the discount! Very good service and we are full and happy! Not crowded for a weekend.
4
We have been visiting Cafe 2000 over the last 9 years. This restaurant is recommended for family dining and it's kids friendly as well. The chefs and restaurant staff were very flexible and considerate to provide us mash potatoes for my toddler even though it was not part of the spread. During the last dining experience, the chef even went to the extra mile to replace the noodles with clear soup instead of laksa soup for my kids. We feel the buffet spread could be much better if more international savoury selection are included. The restaurant managers are overall attentive as well.
5
Many different variety. Chili crab and black pepper crab are all very yummy. Deserts cover western and oriental tastes. Value for money: excellent
4
I love the steamed mid crab. Seafood is generally ok but we esp loved the oysters and steamed crab. Alaskan crab is too salty for my taste. Coffee is not fantastic.
4
Mainly supports the hotel. It has an outside terrace on the street that give a european ambiance to the place - great for breakfast where the selection is wide and OK. Coffee bar is animated and service is good and friendly there.
5
Its best for lobster bisque.and we try their other food.and its all delicious..plus excellent service.thumbs up!!
3
I went there for having our lunch. The service is not really nice, their smile must be so expensive since they never gave us their smile (not all, but mostly).Food just so so, they allow us to take more bread if we want more bread.Some people said this cafe very nice, but for me just so so. Nothing's special about this cafe
1
Heard that this cafe was good and came to try it out.If being crowded was a measure of how good the place was, Cafe 2000 couldn't be measured in this way. We stood at the reception desk for more than 5 minutes and there was no restaurant manager or staff to usher us in. It was shocking that they put tables and chairs at the corridor. I disagree that it is a sign that it is too popular. Instead, for trying to accommodate more customer, its service standard is badly affected.It was very noisy in general and especially when the guest at the next table were talking loudly all the time using vulgarities every so often.Halfway through out lunch, there was a loud argument that broke out in the kitchen. I can only imagine that the overworked staff and lousy managers were the reasons. Food was ordinary but I am certain you can get better spread and better quality food elsewhere for this price. Sashimi was okay only, not fantastic.Of all the team, the waitress who clear the table is the most attentive. The few managers (or assistant managers) - those in black coat - were substandard. Asked for the bill, gave the credit card and it was 15 minutes before realising that he just place it at the counter for "someone" to process the bill. When confronting them, they just brushed it aside without a bit of sincerity. The overall feel of Cafe 2000 today, over-rated and unpleasant. Perhaps, there were problem with the leadership and team at the restaurant. Horrible
4
For the price you pay, the ambiance and the food was not too bad for a family outing. The seafood was very fresh, the staff was very diligent in clearing all the dirty plates. The rest of the food was also interesting, you have your local delights esp the Durian Penyat which was delicious 
3
Went to this restaurant for semi-buffet lunch with office colleague. You can choose either one of the 6 main course like jumbo chicken, steak, seafood linguini, etc and the rest of the bread, salad, fruits, ice-cream, cakes, etc come with the package. It's $32++. The jumbo chicken taste ok only. Broccoli soup is a bit bland. You have to add your own salt and pepper to make it taste better. A few choices of salad with condiments like feta or cheddar cheese, with walnut, olive and a few salad dressing to choose from. You can also add the balsamic vinegar or olive oil for better taste. The seafood linguini which I took taste more like 'laksa' (gravy mixed with coconut milk). The prawn is the frozen one and not the fresh type mixed with squid, mussel and fish. It just doesn't blend well. The dessert, durian puree is quite nice. Ice-cream is also good. Few varieties so I guess it goes with the amount as well. The semi-buffet lunch comes with coffee/tea
5
Eclectic choice of Asian and international dishes for breakfast and the dinner seafood buffet is just a gluttons delight. Huge choice of dishes and go around as many times as you like and then have your main course choices BBQ'd to order, and don't forget the chocolate fountain for the children to finish off with! Just my kind of place to eat and the service is also excellent
5
Had dinner buffet yesterday and I was impress with the buffet spread. There were simply too many choices. Cold crabs, oyster, scallop, prawns, sashimi to cooked lobster, yummy satay, herbal chicken, roast pork and beef and appealing dessert counter with hot in demand durian puree! Is on my to visit again list as I had not tried everything like the seafood yong tau foo laksa
5
excellent breakfasts a lot of different choices lover the curries and parata were excellent, all food to a high standard
4
Restaurant cafe at M hotel provide Good fusion food at reasonable price. A friendly atmosphere with good service. Staff are polite and helpful.
5
Although Café 2000 is the coffee shop of M Hotel but it looks like an expensive restaurant. Seafood and international buffet for lunch and dinner available daily including weekends. Excellent chili crab. Very friendly service staffs. Free parking for diners.
5
The meal was fantastic, the spread was good and the service was excellent. Will certainly hope to come back.
4
Nice buffet! The new BBQ needs to improve as the meats get overcooked! The various choice are satisfactory
3
Limited varieties as compared to other buffets. Seafood replenish took quite a long time. The only thing that i enjoyed is their durian puree.
5
The Buffet dinner spread at Cafe 2000 was really money worth. We went on 21 April, Tuesday & were lucky as we had Crab galore! Crabs cooked in curry sauce, sweet & sour sauce & steamed crabs with ginger & vinegar sauce.There were really very much for us to enjoy, the food was fresh & delicious. Though there were few staff serving but they were very efficient & attentive to our needs.I should strongly recommend this Cafe at M Hotel to anyone who wishes to enjoy real quality food with pleasant view & services
1
Made a reservation week before But only Got informed that they overbooked and full house on the day itself. If you are unable to provide the service Don't promise it. No proper system to manage the reservations. Lousy management! UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED. How do they expect me to find another place to celebrate my wife's birthday at the very last minute.
4
Decided to give this place a try on Sunday night given the SCB credit card 3 for 2 offer. Total all in bill came in about S$45 per person which was very good value given the seafood selection of crabs, lobster, prawns, shell fish and sashimi on offer. A bit disappointed that there were no fresh oysters (there were deep fried ones instead) and was told that this was only available on Friday and Saturday. We came early and strategically sat right beside the buffet selection which is key to a good experience â€“ the best food (especially the sashimi and other high value seafood) is out in small portions and not replenished quickly. The sashimi plate in particular is wiped out after the third person takes his helping
4
Was there for the seafood and BBQ buffet. The place was packed. The tables are a little too close for comfort. The quality of the food was good. We especially liked the BBQ beef, scallop, salmon and otah. You select the raw meat and seafood, they take it away to be barbecued and then bring it back to your table. One of our orders went missing and another was wrongly delivered to us.
4
Last time I could have so much variety of crab around 5 dishes. But this time, I only can get 2. Is there any difference by days?
5
The BBQ Crab and Steak was simply the best. There were also a wide variety of local food. The durian Penyet was also delicious.
5
Really great atmosphere with lovely staff. great food great range of buffet. Excellent price for the rAnge
3
Had a dinner buffet with friends on a Friday. Variety of cooked dishes are plenty and they have some where the chef will cook it for you, like the sausages. There is also a seafood station where chefs will BBQ your seafood outdoor and bring it in for you once it's ready. Dessert station has a nice variety and includes some nonya kuehs too. However, food should be replenished quickly, especially during peak periods
3
I've eaten in Cafe 2000 on quite a few occasions when I've had functions at the M Hotel. Its consistently has very poor service and bland food.It's not that the staff are rude, it's just disorganized. Everyday it seems like its a newly opened restaurant with no one really in charge and staff a bit confused.Also to food is low quality with not much flavor. They try to give the impression of being a high end place, but do it very badly. It's not horrible, but go elsewhere if you have the option as there's a lot of restaurants nearby. Unfortunately I don't always have the option
5
I don't mind paying s$80 for a seafood buffet here at cafe 2000.Such a wide spread.They also have a BBQ area where you can decide which meet you would like them to prepare for you. I think they also have 3-4 types of crab dishes.I must try buffet that worth every penny
4
Good spread of food, from seafood, crabs cooked in different ways, oysters, prawns, crayfish, etc. Grilled steak, porkribs, sushi, sashimi, pasta, etc. Quality of food is good and fresh. Free flow of coffee and peppermint tea. The durian penyet (pudding) in the dessert, is especially good and popular. Service staff are generally attentive. Would be happy to visit again

With a couple of close clients and good friends working in the vicnity of M Hotel Singapore, it was inevitable that we would end up doing lunches at Cafe 2000 at M Hotel. So we did, yes, and it is a lovely place to dine in, regardless of whether you choose the buffet or order from the a la carte menus.The cafe is always filled up with busy executives / business types during lunch hour, and the polite hosts always manages to find seats for us despite of the lack of reservations of crowdedness. We appreciated that, of course. This elegantly-furnished place comes with an easy-going setting and comfortable hues of brown-beige tones to provide diners a totally relaxed meal setting.Once order is placed, an egg-shaped bread roll along with butter would be served for the diners to get a headstart on their meals. While not very soft, this roll makes for great chewing texture, and tastes amazingly well with lightly-flavored butter.I had the Smoked Salmon Salad - fresh salmon amongst sweet, crisp greens endorsed with flakes of cheese - this salad is healthy and absolutely delicious.*Sheryl had the Spaghetti Bolognese - that came with greens atop, a rather unique concept. The pasta was soft but not soggy, and tasted awesomely lovely of quality minced beef. She especially loved it that there was sprigs of vegetables accompanying the otherwise plainly-ingrediented pasta dish. The minced beef was lean, and cooked to tender tastiness; with a lightly-based tomato sauce.*Christal tried the Asian dish of Fried Hokkien Noodles (fried Chinese yellow and white noodles with prawns, squids, and tiny strips of pork). It was served on banana leaf - something that's a rarity these days, and hence a delight to us. The aroma was tantalizing, and the generous portions of seafood added to the sumptuousness of this dish. Although one could easily find nice Fried Hokkien Noodles in hawker centres or food courts at perhaps 1/4 of the price here, this dish did not disappoint , and was worth every single cent.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/lunch-at-cafe-2000-m-hotel.htm

Had lunch with 3 friends there as one of us had loyalty program (Ala carte card) vouchers to use. All 4 of us had the Executve semi-buffet lunch at $32 ++ per person where appetizers and desserts were buffet style with a choice of main course from a selection of 6 dishes. When we arrived, it was quite bustling but we were quickly seated in the main area. After that, nothing happened. No menu, no water, no waiter ... After 5 minutes of waiting we tried to get a waiter for the menu which took another 5 minutes although there were 4 to 5 waiters in the general area - all seemed busy and all never seemed to look around except their own specific task. Finally got a waiter and ordered our mains from a choice that included lamp chops, barramundi, wagyu beef fried hor fun and lobster fried rice. Went to appetizer buffer - very small selection of about 5 types of cold salads/appetizers (all in small serving bowls) and 2 soups (1 western and 1 asian). Western soup of watercress and lobster had no lobster at all and was watered down and bland. Filled ourselves up with bread to make up for lack of choice in appetizer section. Slow service for clearing of plates. Mains came - barramundi was a very small slice 2 inch by 4 inches crowded out by huge salad (to make up for the lack of the fish I guess). Lamb chops was sweet (??) Wagyu pieces in the beef hor fun was thinly sliced like prosciutto and there were in total maybe 5 or 6 slices in the whole plate. Desserts were as sad as the appetizers - miniature (1.5 cm squares) of variety of cakes, 4 types of sliced fruits and small choc fountain where the only choices are jackfruit, another fruit and cheap marshmallow for dipping. Frankly, a very unsatisfying meal and if not for the vouchers, it would have been a great rip off to pay $32++ for that meal

Cafe 2000 at M Hotel has pretty good buffet dinner spread.Pros:-- Good selection / buffet spread (Local food, Western, Japanese, Fresh & Grilled Seafood). Just choose your seafood that you want to grill and just pass to a waiter.- I love the satay, fresh prawns, chicken sausage, sashimi, otak-otak and crabs. The other food is pretty good as well.- Coffee and tea is included as part of the buffet- Dessert - pretty decent spread as well. I LOVE the durian puree! I had like 8 small shots :). They also have chocolate fondue- Free parking if you drive.- About 10-15 mins walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT. Cons- Not suitable for a big group(more than 10 people?). Tables are too close together as the place is pretty small.- They are very slow at refilling some of the food - example sashimi and desserts (cakes). Maybe not enough?Tips- Go after 8.30pm. Less crowd. Make reservation and ask for window seat. If you find this review helpful, please click on the "helpful" button. Thank you! :
