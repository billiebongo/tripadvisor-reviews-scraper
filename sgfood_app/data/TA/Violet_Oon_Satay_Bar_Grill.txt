The food tastes amazing, ambiance was great and most of all we were impressed by the exceptional service provided by Nizam.

Hanged out together with office buddies. Variety of food options with drinks too.
Multilingual waiters speaking Malay, Tamil, Chinese, etc..
The location is on the shores of river bay that makes after dinner walk too enjoyable!

Great service! Great place to visit for premium nyona dishes! I was there for a birthday celebration and the staff gave us a framed photo of us! It's a nice and thoughtful gift. Portion of the food were rather small.

A dear friend treated me to peranakan fare and thought VO was reputable enough for a good feed. Situated at Clarke Quay, many other restaurants ( Red House Seafood opposite) surrounding and a night spot in the same complex.The exterior and entry was impressive. Detail attention paid to wall tiles, mirror and colours. Once inside, the bar stood out and tables for 2, 4 or 6 , or simply sit at high bench. Food ordered were satay chicken ($14) and pork ($16 ), “kueh pie tee” , Babi bongtay, dried mee Siam. Satay prices were quite costly but we expected at least 5 sticks ......not stated on menu as 3 sticks !!! Meat has slight chargrilled flavour but unfortunately with overly health consciousness, meat were lean and tasted ordinary. Peanut sauce lacked peanut flavour even though it has the old dollop of grated pineapple. It was adding insult to injury when the cucumber were dry and skin leathery (I suspect they’ve been cut very early in the day and left on kitchen bench, drying out . Looking back, that stall at Geylang Serai wet market beat it hands down!! Kueh pie tee shells were crispy but fillings were disappointing as it lacks the taucho taste. Dried meesiam quite tasty but they used the white laksa noodles instead of bee hoon. Finally Babi bongtay was just as flat. The waiter who served us was very friendly and accommodating. He , too, was shocked when we pointed out about the old dry leathery cucumber. He asked CHEF and was told they were FRESHLY cut!! Any person who cooks can tell the difference, so..".???In a nutshell, I really dissatisfied and disappointed! Verdict:: 6/10

This is one of the few super memorable dinner I have had, and it’s not just the company! Just about every dish, in fact, every dish we had was superb. We had the “ngoh hiang” which was plump and moist served with this very addictive chilli paste, the grilled chicken satay, generous sticks of marinated grilled chicken pieces, beef rendang, the absolute best, “chap chye” stewed vegetables perfect to calm the heat from the chilli and the sea bass, covered in prawn chilli and “chinchalok” a local fermented prawn paste. They didn’t have a big selection of desserts but the “chendol” was very good, and enough for 2 to share.Service is decent, not the best but they try. I only wished they have bigger tables, so as to accommodate all the dishes you’ll want to order

Food is value for money. The background music was too loud that it drowned conversation. Service have to improve. The moment I arrived the waitress asked me if I want still water or sparkling water. I told her I want to wait for my 2 guest to arrive first. Then she walked away and brought back another waitress to ask for my choice of water. When I was eating my satay, I put the sticks on my plate when the waitress brought a container over for me to put the sticks. Then when I was eating my second helping, I put the sticks on my plate. While I was still cutting the prawns, waitress walked over to take sticks directly from my plate to put inside the container. The restaurant was not half full by 7.30pm but different wait staff kept coming over to ask if we want more items. When we didn’t place more they sent the male staff over with menu open and asked what we want for dessert.

Loved the decor in this building. It’s at the start of Clarke Quay so you don’t have far to go to grab a taxi. The food was really good; Pork satay to start followed by Beef Rendang and Barramundi. We also enjoyed a lovely bottle of red wine to accompany our meal. Our waiter was really enthusiastic and friendly. It was pleasing to see that Violet Oon was in the restaurant that evening too. So lovely to see a “celebrity” chef sharing dining experiences with her guests
4
We were there for 2 birthday celebrations and the staff made every effort for a wonderful evening including framing a photo for all of us! Great thought!However the food was rather disappointing. Tripe satay was too salty and they replaced with another who was tasteless! After checking with us, it was removed from the bill. The sayur lodeh had too much coconut milk and hardly any veg! The chicken satay had little flavour and only slgihtly grilled.I feel the restaurant tried to be high end and change the food to a different level, away from the traditional! I will not go again much as I like the service. I must enjoy the food if I were to go back to the same restaurant
5
I didn’t believe Satay can be that good in a “ high class “ place .was reccomended by a Friend to try it and i wasn’t disappointed. Seeing the chefs in action was a plus point . And food were definitely a must try . Well at least it’s called a satay bar for a reason . Food is value for money and another plus point is that Chef kelven came out and check if everything is okay. Simply shows the Chef really cares for consumer feedback and have pride in what they do . Way to go and will be back ! ☺️☺

We had a lovely meal with mum, she absolutely loved it. We were at first seated in front of the satay station where we enjoyed champagne and cocktails whilst watching the chefs flame cook satay skewers! This whetted our appetites, we sat on the high tables which we shared with other groups of diners. The food was delicious, especially the beef rendang, nasi goreng and prawn skewers. All dishes were hot for a western palette (which I liked) but I’m sure you could ask for them less spicy if you wanted. Service was brilliant, waiters friendly and able to have a laugh! Looking forward to trying out the violet oon branch in the art gallery next.
3
This was the sister restaurant for National Kitchen. It serves both Peranakan as well as grilled dishes. The chicken satay was decent but I felt that the standard of cooking at National Kitchen was better.
4
very lively bar/restaurant. service was excellent, food was of a high standard and did not disappoint.
5
Food did not disappoint, service was up to standards ... will definitely be back again! Love the pulut hitam!
5
Great food especially the satay ..
Is one of the best I’ve ever tasted .
The satay sauce is yummy ..
4
7 adults, 2 teenagers.
We ordered a range of food, but mostly satay, all of which were delicious.
Service was very good, attentive and available.
Not expensive and a nice ambience.
We all enjoyed the evening.
4
We had a great time here and had the opportunity to share different Satan’s and dishes. The atmosphere is casual and the service very prompt and professional
5
Very nice restaurant. One of the best in Clarke Quay area. Very classy and great satay. Staff were very helpful and nice. Bar tender even made us a special drink for dessert. Loved it.
5
Buzzy area, lovely decor with satay cooking on view. Delicious meal. Tofu salad had a great spicy sauce, winged bean salad interesting. Nasi goreng, beef rendang, wagyu and satays all beautifully cooked. Service was good. Bathrooms shared and brief walk required but you get to check out the location that way
5
Must eat pork and beef satay. Eat many sticks of it as is very delicious. The Assam Bak with garlic vinaigrette tuned out to be a pleasant combo, no regrets as the pork is so tender. Chap Chye and Ngor Hiang very good. The desserts we like the Pulot Hitam with coconut ice cream, but we all agreed the Chendol Bingsu with durian pengat to die for.Basically, all the dishes we had was superb. Had a great nigh
5
Went on Christmas Eve with a friend. The restaurant is elegant while the waiters/waitress are really friendly. Even during peak hours they still gave us full attention.Food is Nyonya style which is kinda a mixture of Malay & Chinese cuisine. Most are spicy so be alerted. Highly recommend the Beef Rendang!! The portion is large as for its price and beef is tender & moist. Love it!The price is really reasonable with such good vibe, food and service
4
Second time here and definitely not the last! Just wished that there were more nuts in the buah keluak.
5
We absolutely fell in love with the old world interior decor of this Peranakan restaurant that serves probably the best food of its kind on the island. The service was also truly outstanding.
5
Local food served by an attentive team of wait staff. The interiors were tastefully decorated and food were presented in a modern manner. Quality of food was yummy! Overseas guests present were intrigued by the local food variety so it is a great place to bring overseas guests who might be interested in local food culture.
5
For our last night in Singapore we wanted to go somewhere nice and found Violet Oon's restaurants on line, while she has some others this matched our price point and was an ideal location for us. As we had a full day of sightseeing we did not book a table and arrived to find it was fully booked but we were able to sit at the bar (which is fine by us). The Satay was just amazing, the best we have ever had and sadly nothing will now match up. The Beef Rendang was also perfection and service was impeccable
4
Food was great. Variety was diff from NG outlet. Must try satay, dry laksa, and durian chendol pengat. Grilled prawns were a bit small though. One constructive comment is don’t overdo the waiting at table to clear the plates. The eagerness could be a bit irritating. But besides that, staff were friendly and accommodating
5
All the items on the menu are sharing portions - my wife and I ordered 2 starters, one main and a dessert to share - it was just about right.The wing bean salad was refreshing and good to start the meal with.The grilled beef (3rd item in the menu - see picture), is a must try and best paired with jasmine white rice and the house red (Cabernet Sauvignon).As for desserts, I like the pulut hitam (black rice pudding) with coconut ice cream.I’d recommend going on a weekday evening, after 8.30pm, when it’ll be less crowded and when you’re more likely to get a seat without reservation
4
A friend's plug for the satay brought me and my visiting friend here. We ordered the chicken, beef and prawn satay, thinking that we could well handle each serving of three sticks. Unless you're ravenous or plan to have less of the mains, go with one or two selection as the chicken satay was chunky. It was the best of the three, true to the recommendation of the serving staff. Dry laksa was another of his spot-on recommendation and it would be my reason to return along with the sayor lodeh. Staff service and knowledge were great and we left stuffed, skipping dessert. Be prepared to talk above the noise which the reservations staff highlighted when confirming my booking. Lovely decor.
4
Got a counter seat by the bar. Bartender and staff were extremely friendly and service was great.Pork and prawn satays were delicious...extremely tender and full of flavour. Grilled fish was nicely done.Kueh pie tee was a little cold though.A little pricey for this type of food...but everything is just taken to a different level.Will definitely be back
4
Clearly this outlet specialises in satays and they were all very well done, don't shy away from the pork satay if the waiter tells you it's fatty, that's what gives it flavour. Wish we could afford some wine to go with the food, hope to see them offer sone wine around the $40-60 range instead of the current $85-130 per bottl
4
What’s a most like dish for me? Surely, Beef satay from open kitchen. You can see how they grill it. It was fresh, soft, the sauce was very tasty, eat together with onion and cucumber. Another good dish is tofu, I love its smell and the way to eat with sprouts.
2
Overpriced for what it is... food was average and service useless. Also the fact that there are no toilet facilities onsite is slightly off putting.
5
Violet Oon never fails to satisfy our cravings. Standard of food served is always consistent. Definitely a pleasant dining experience coupled with great service and nice ambience.
5
This restaurant has a great atmosphere, very good food and the staff are very helpful and attentive. Situated on Clarke Quay, this is a restaurant we would visit again. Thank you to the staff for their help and advice.
5
Service is excellent, goes hand in hand with the food! Every outlet maintains the same delicious high standard of peranakan cuisine. Love the dry laksa, the beef panggang, kueh pie tee and the pulut hitam was perfect!
4
Overall, an excellent dining experience. Lives up to its expectation in delivering bold and gutsy flavours but still in keeping with traditional Peranakan classic tastes.
Do not leave without trying the pork satay!
5
Friendly staff provides good service, great dishes. Love it overall. Waited extra 30min to get our table.
5
The pork satay, made with fatty pork, is to die for! Tender pieces of pork with thick pieces of fat separating each piece on the satay stick, grilled to perfection. When dipped in the satay sauce, the satay was just smackingly scrumptious! The kunyit lemak sotong was succulent, cooked just right, and the gravy was just lemak enough without being too rich. The sayur lodeh, too, was rich without being too rich. And the winged bean salad was so crunchy and tasty, my son couldn't stop taking mouthfuls of it! I've never liked the too green flavour of raw beans but the sauce that accompanied the salad really paired well with the crunchy winged beans and set off the greenness of the flavour beautifully! The service, too, was attentive and thoughtful. Some people might say that the prices are somewhat high for local Peranakan food, but this is Peranakan food done so well in fine dining style, without the fine dining prices. And if you want a wine to go with these dishes, the prosecco pairs very well with the flavours
4
The service crew was hospitable, and able to make sound recommendations. The meal was quite pricy for per portion, but it was authentic peranakan food and well worth it. Best shared with small groups of 3-5 pax per serving. Enjoyed the ambience too. Dishes that stood out were assam bak, chap chye, beef tripe and pork satay, as well as the tauhu goreng, beef rendang and kueh pietee. Best paired with some rice as these dishes are quite rich and savoury.Desserts wise, the chendol wasn't as good as the kueh bengkah.
5
I do not like Clark Quays (too noisy, too crowded) but to go to Violet Oon I am ready to make an exception. I liked the place at the National Gallery (Singapore) and this place is also very nice. I like the atmosphere and the food is very good spicy but not too, all the Peranakan classics were there and as we were many wr could enjoy several dishes. Defiitely a "no surprise" place where you can come with guests
5
I went there to taste their satay. Friendly staff advised me which one to choose and gave me explanations on other dishes. I ordered the pork satay which was delicious with the sauce coming along.  I decided to come back a second time and enjoyed the beef pengang which was as well wonderful.A special thanks for the service which is really a difference to the other restaurants in the are
4
The fat in the satay was burnt black but still delicious nevertheless. Perhaps because we were late diners the coconut gravy in the sayur lodeh was too thick. Still yummy though.
3
We had dinner here and ordered pork satay, ngo hiang or fried shrimp roll, fried rice and fried tofu. All cooked too sweet for my taste. The ice chendol durian was good though. Service was very helpful and friendly.
5
True Peranakan flavors, loved the presentation and portions. Favorite is the Durian Cendol. Will definitely come back again.
4
We both love satays and found Violet Oon at Clarke Quay. We ordered the beef and chicken satays and the portions were generous and really a must try. Another dish we tried was the Dry mee siam (prawns with rice noodles). If we ever go back to Singapore, we'll visit the other Violet Oon location at the National Gallery
4
I can be kind of a picky eater so I wasn't too impressed with the menu (mainly because I can't eat seafood). I ordered the chicken satay and it was really delicious, especially the red peanut sauce that came with it. The rest of my dining party really enjoyed their food so while my eating experience was okay, I would have to say that my restrictions aren't a good baseline so adding theirs in pushes my review up to a Very Good. The service was also great
5
The food was good as it had always been at the Bukit Timah outlet. I like that the menu has ngoh hiang made with chicken so my Muslim friend could try that and she loved it. All the dishes we ordered were good. Ad best of all, the service is excellent. I commented that the ginger beer didn’t quite have the zing like the ones I had before and the waiter offered to change it, which was really unexpected since I had merely wanted to give feedback. I will definitely be back again.
4
3 of us came here and had a good meal, with excellent satay to start. The mains were not exactly disappointing, but didn't quite live up to the promise of the place. To be honest, I've had better beef rending elsewhere. The staff were a bit too friendly and not perfectly efficient, managing to pour some of our bottle of wine into glasses on another table and then, when we spotted it, trying to pretend they hadn't. But overall, pretty good - and nice to walk into a place to find a lot of Asian customers, not just western ex-pats, especially in Clark Quay
5
The place has a nice ambiance, decoration and very nice service. The drink option has a big range from beer to cocktails and hard drinks.Food was really good. They have some of VO signatures and new offerings from this place, Satay, as the place is called.The place is also ok to bring office visitors to experience local food without the "hawker" atmosphere.Try it out
5
would have been perfect if the lady who confirmed my reservation had told the restaurant that I had requested not to be on the high chair. was very uncomfortable for my mother who had problem getting up the seat. On the other hand, staff in the restaurant were very attentive and helped her each time she has to get down and up the seat. Staff also made an effort to introduced the dishes and attentive to our needs. Would be back again.
4
It can be a place to be recommended to taste local food with a modern twist and nice environment instead of landing in hawker stall in Singapore which is far too local for many foreigners! The satay is nice, with the right condiments that is so difficult to find from some place else if it's not a local stall. Only that they can reduce the size of each skewers to make it more authentic. Assam barramundi tastes very well. Resembles the Assam fish curry from Penang. Dry Laksa is also very tasty. I wish I had enough room to try dry mee Siam!Originally I wanted to book the branch in the National Gallery. But it was full. So I guess the food is even better there? I was disappointed that the restaurant doesn't have their own washroom facility. Having to walk 5 min outside, passing by all the low end pubs and bars, and use the facility that belongs to the attaché complex and its condition seems to me like a public toilet was a shock to me towards the end of my dining here. It kind of spoil it
4
Love their Buah keluak & beef rendang. Portions are small though so if you're dining in a big group you wl hv to order multiple orders of each dish.
4
Food was rich but good. Beef was tender. The place gets a little noisy but otherwise service was Good
4
The pork and chicken satay was excellent, grilled to perfection. The disappointment to the evening was when the Durian chendol was served. The green chendol was hard ( as though it had not been properly thawed or was days old!) and the dollop of durian was miserly. The even greater disappointment was learning that the restaurant serves neither tea nor coffee, which would have been welcomed after such a rich and satisfying meal! (Peppermint tea or a Long black or the local Teh Halia would have been appreciated!) Hope the restaurant considers adding beverages to their menu,
5
Brought two of our guests from Japan for dinner on a Friday night and the food, service, ambience and drinks were excellent! There were four 4 us. We had the satay, assam fish, sotong, kueh pie tee, dry laksa, fried rice, chap chye. Every dish was yummy! For dessert, we had the ice cream, puloh hitam and the kueh which were all very good too!The satay came in huge sticks, not your usual satay. Food portions were small so you could order several dishes and have a chance to taste many. The wine recommended by the staff was lovely too. Definitely need reservations as tables were quickly filled by 7pm. We were there from 6pm. I would definitely visit the restaurant again. If you have been to their other outlet at the art gallery, do visit this too. The food selection is not the same. I must commend the service. Thank you
3
Well designed restaurant with a bar, a quite long table and also normal setting. Very good service, courteous and fast.Good pork satay (3 good size skewers), nice beef rendang and savoury sweets. Good selection of beverages, wines, beers and spirits.A good place to sample
4
Mix up as we meant to book the one at the National Gallery which we have been to before. Realised in time. This is a nice venue with not quite the wow factor of the other. Good quite friendly service. Chicken satay was great. Big chunks of juicy chicken with a sate sauce with a nice level of heat. Pork ones nice but not as good. Beef rendang was good and melt in your mouth. Wing bean salad nice spicy and pungent with the shrimp paste. Chicken and vegetable curries not memorable. Barramundi with pineapple salsa really good and the sharpness of the pineapple cut through the richness of some of the other dishes. The Black diamond was quite different to other versions I have had and wasn't to my taste. Tapioca cake was really nice way to finish up. All washed down with some reasonably priced ( for SG) Kiwi Sauvignon Blanc
3
I have dined at both National Kitchen and Violet Oon at Bukit Timah Road. Of the three VO restaurants this is the newest but also probably the weakest. In my opinion the one at Bukit Timah is still the st in flavour and service. I was at VO Satay Club last night and it was crowded and noisy. It wasn't easy to get attention of the waitstaff but once they arrived they were friendly and helpful. The satay was tender and came with a generous serving of sauce with grated pineapple. The rendang had good texture. However, it was strange that the various dishes - whether veg, meat or seafood, had a rather pronounced sweet flavor. Perhaps too much sugar in the recipes
2
We love the food in violet's restaurants having been probably six times to her Bukit Timah original restaurant. The food didn't disappoint. The noise from a large party plus the music at a high level made us vow never to return. Yes Chope does warn about noise but it was unclear if this warning was generic or for the specific day and time we booked for. When the group left the music continued at a high level still making it difficult to talk.The staff acknowledged the noise and comped two dishes however they also came to our table so many times to apologize that this further disturbed our evening out looking for relaxation.While I appreciate the industrial Pernanakan design of this new restaurant some sound absorbing acoustic tiles hidden in the ceiling would be welcome
5
I had a great meal at the National Gallery location with my boss some months ago so I was anxious to bring my friends/visitors to check it out. Unfortunately the National Gallery place was fully booked for dinner (for at least the next 2 weeks!), so the nice and friendly lady who answered their phone recommended this Clarke Quay location. Even then, we could only be seated at 9.00pm.We got there about 30 mins earlier and were offered seating near the bar while we waited. They very kindly offered to comp the first round of drinks while we waited, which was much appreciated.When we were finally seated, the rest of the evening turned out to be excellent. The beef rendang was unanimously voted to be the best ever - something we would definitely order again. The pork and chicken satay were also tasty and meaty. I also enjoyed the Buah Keluak Ayam, although the betel nut filling was a bit too intense for my visitors. The Dry Laksa was interesting but it's not particularly special. For dessert, we ordered the Kueh Beng Kah (tapioca cake with gula melaka and coconut milk) and VO's Ice Cream with Cashew Crunch; the latter was a huge hit.The cocktails menu was also quite refreshing and I did enjoy the Sidecar. The service was attentive but just a notch lower than what I experienced at the other location. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable. We were warned that the noise level would be a little higher than at the National Gallery (and they were right), possible because this one is located at Clarke Quay - almost everything is noisier there! So if you're planning a romantic evening, learn to lean in!Overall, we had a great time (everyone was saying how sated they were at the end of dinner). I would definitely recommend the place (both this one and the one at National Gallery)
5
We booked dinner here for our last evening in Singapore and it was lovely. Booked online for 9pm but the weather wasn't great so arrived early to have a drink at the bar first. On arrival the staff were very welcoming and managed to have our table ready a little earlier than we had booked. The service was excellent, Clover really looked after us - recommended some dishes for us and made us feel very welcome. The beef satay was the best we had during our trip and the beef rendang and barramundi were gorgeous too. The cocktails were great and ginger beer is worth sampling too. I'd definitely come back to Singapore to dine here again.
5
Great food, great service and lovely decor. Highly recommend the Beef Randang, the best I have ever tasted! The pork belly was delicious and they do a very tasty range of Satays. We will definitely be back!
5
Love the interiors, the variety, the taste, the service staff -- everything! Will definitely be back over and over again!
5
Delicious and fast! Clover was an excellent waiter. Thank you for a lovely meal and a great dessert recommendation ( tapioca ).
4
We were greeted by very friendly staff. Great atmosphere and good food. A pity we didn't get to dessert because we were already too full.
4
Pricey if compared to traditional hawker fare, but with a slight mindset change, actually excellent value with respect to high end restaurants. We had the dry laksa (v flavoursome, as good or better than its Katong counterpart), the grilled sea bass (a large portion for $42), and the "otak". Having lived in Singapore previously: authentic. Was also a nice spot for a date with wife.
5
The best Satay I've ever had and some really interesting and tasty Peranakan dishes that I'd never tried before. Affordable wine selection. Beautiful setting and layout with very good service. Gula Melaka and Coconut ice cream was a great way to finish. My only complaint (as with so many restaurants in Singapore) is that you have to use the horrific and terrible public toilets of Clarke Quay to wash up
5
I have just come back from one the most memorable meal memories since living in Singapore. Recommended to us you will not be disappointed, The Beef Rendang is legendary and melts like marshmallow, the satay sauce was soo good we had to get some to bring home! The satay were large, moist and tender. The barramundi was amazing - and to top it off the Tapioca Cake - out of this world! The service was attentive from everyone - a special shout out to Clover (on loan tonight from the National Gallery restaurant) was the type of waiter that makes you go out for dinner, His level off attentiveness and genuine friendliness really made the night. In fact everyone is very concerned that everything is right for you. The prices at this outlets (satay bar and grill) are not over the top for Singapore - but the quality of food and wine is well worth it. WInelist as small but affordable and atmosphere noisey and buzzy - well worth a visit or taking your singapore visitors to when you are sick of the hawkers markets and dont want to be ripped off at the tourist cafes along the waterfront of Clarke Qua
3
I and my wife visited this restaurant for the 1st time. We ordered 3 dishes for our dinner, 1st dish was Ngoh Hiang which was good and maintained the standard as the other 2 outlets. 2nd dish was Pork Satay in Hainanese Style which we considered a failure, because it did not has the authentic and unique flavour as compared to many hawker stalls selling the same type of Satay. 3rd dish was Dried Mee Siam which was too spicy and hot even for average Singaporean like ourselves. We suggested that the restaurant should give options such as mild, normal and spicy version to diners. The best experience we had that night was when we could not stand the hot and spicy taste of the 3rd dish, we ordered 2 Chendol, hoping that this sweet dessert would reduce the hot and spicy Dried Mee Siam which actually was quite good. The waiter advised us to have 1 Chendol instead of 2 because he felt that 1 serving was good enough for 2 of us to share, which was proven to be correct. We really appreciated his kind advice but not to increase the sales at the expense of the customers
3
I had high expectations from the outside and beautiful decor. The chicken satay was rather greasy and the meat was fatty. My main course was placed on the table whilst I was only half way through my starter, something that I cannot fathom. The dry laksa was recommended to me by waiter, however, when it arrived rather than being a noodle dish, it was more like pasta. The dish had an unpleasant texture as it was gritty, however the prawns were well cooked and spice was good. I am disappointed and am hoping this was just a one off.
4
Slightly away from the main hustle & bustle of Clarke quay and a welcome chance to enjoy more local fare. The Beef Satay was lovely, only three Satay sticks was a bit mean for 17 dollars but the spicy satay sauce flavoured with prawn & pineapple was great. Cheaper local beer Tiger was not available forcing you to choose the more expensive ales that are on the menu, naughty! The coconut & malaka ice cream was a delight, I would recommend
5
An excellent meal and impeccable service. Its Beef Tripe satay and Beef Rendang is a must-order whenever we dine at the restaurant.
5
Service standards was amazing, compliments to RV at Clarke quay outlet.
Food quality was exceptional, bursting with flavours.
Definitely return, for sure!
5
Super friendly and helpful staff. Great satay, would recommend just ordering satay as it's filling. Can be a bit noisy but the food and service is great
4
the food was good, but the preparation was overly done that the simplicity of the flavours were overpowered. food was expensive, but given the location and ambience understandable
3
The decor of the restaurant is one that is designed to reminisce colonial times in Singapore. The VO logo was everywhere, and I mean everywhere... The place is probably known for its satays, and we throughly enjoyed the pork and chicken satay. The beef was left left wanting. The cocktails were not the best, but it's probably due to the unique offerings rather than the mixologist.Dinner was expensive, worked out to be about $250 for a party of 4 with one cocktail each. There are definitely places that are cheaper and better food out in Singapore. Regardless, it was an interesting experience
5
This place was so good it made me angry because now my favorite restaurant in Atlanta for Malaysian pales in comparison!! The food was so innovative and outstanding I'll jot soon forget it. While I showed up without a reservation last minute, and they were able to see me at the bar. The bartender was friendly and made the solo visit enjoyable. A local recommended this to me and it did not disappoint.
4
Despite challenges trying to get the notice of the serving staff, when we did have their attention, they tried their hardest to deliver, and anticipate our needs. The food, served family style, is tasty and some dishes have a complexity associated with Straits Chinese cuisine. The restaurant has a pleasing decor. It's noisy as would be expected from a bistro and unfortunately no toilet facilities in-house (one has to take a 2-3 min walk to the Clarke Quay restrooms)
5
My husband, myself and our two teenage sons enjoyed a lovely dinner at Violet Oon's restaurant in Clarke Quay. I love the dÃ©cor, very classy, yet the atmosphere is relaxed due to the friendly staff and the great selection of music (modern blues). Everything about the restaurant is beautiful yet it's not intimidating or too formal. The staff are very attentive and helpful, I was very impressed with the service. And the food is delicious, we shared beef & chicken satay sticks (3 sticks for $15, lots of meat on each stick) and the rich spicy satay sauce was served on the side. The Beef Rendang was the best we've eaten, the beef is amazingly tender, yum. I wish I could transport this restaurant back to Melbourne, I'd happily eat here regularly
3
Well to be fair I hate Clarke Quay so I wasn't happy when my husbands colleague made a reservation there. 'Paranakan' food is what it sells itself as... if that's what you want save yourself the expense and go to a food court. This place is just overpriced street food and they don't even have their own bathrooms. You have to go to some awful shared ones which even at 8pm were pretty revolting. The food is average at best

Violet and family have it. Decor, stunning. Service, impeccable. Food, delicious of course. From the original Bukit Timah restaurant to the jewel fine diner in the National Gallery to this latest incarnation. Just wonderful. Similar decor, the dark green, the Peranakan floor tiles, the embossed glass and the dark timber. But here, a flaming grill is centre stage and the satays are special. But so too some of Violet's faves. We simply cannot fault it. Our only tip, do ask how many pieces are in the generous small bites like Kueh Pie Ti, you will be surprised by how many (great for a group, lots for a couple) and while they are delicious it may impact your enjoyment of later courses. One of the best things, a well selected wine list covering the key varietals that suit the spices; and more than half by the glass. Nyonya cuisine at its finest. A unique Singapore experience.

Classy decor, warm attentive staff, Cosy atmosphere and most of all good food! The satay is delicious!

Lovely place for special occasions and celebrations. There's even a memorable printed photo as gift!

We enjoyed our meal here so much we went back twice during our week in Singapore. The maitre d, and his excellent staff provided efficient, friendly service. The food was superb and I would recommend it for a most enjoyable evening.
5
Will be back for more unique makan treats! Must try: buah keluak otah, tripe satay and 200-day aged angus rib eye grilled to perfection & topped with green chili padi sambal. Sedap!

the deco of the place will make u feel cosy & class. temperture is right. food is 1 of the better ones i tried so far in clarke quay. value is acceptable looking at the enviroment, food & services provided. staffs were attentive. always there when u need help. 1 disadvantage is it is a bit noisy when it get crowded.

We went there in a group of 6 for a dinner and it was one of the best dinners during this trip. We were sharing food so could try out different tastes which was perfect. Even though I've travelled through Asia quite a bit, there were some things I've never eaten before and I really loved the location (we went to the Clarke Quay Satay Bar) and the ambiance : colonial style, just perfect for the context

Tried the satays (both the chicken and beef) which were very good. Particularly liked the beef one which was extremely tender. Also ordered the chap chye and the babi ponteh. The pork was deliciously sinful, with the fats melting in your mouth. Overall a good experience with delectable peranakan food, albeit the price on the slight high side (given the reputable name)
5
We love every dishes that we ordered, it was simply delicious and we made NO wrongs in it!!! The chunky chicken satays with peanut gravy are sooo good, the Daging panggang so tender and seasoned well, the barranmundi and bajak udang are so fiery....the dessert Bingka to die for and the chendol is out of this world! Thanks for a great meal and company!

Had a solo dinner and enjoyed a good interpretation of local Singapore favourites. The pork & chicken satay were succulent and the grilled beef with green Chilli sambal was well executed. The dry laksa while it had the requisite flavours, I found too oily. The dessert of pulut hitam or black glutinous rice with coconut ice cream was delicious but the sweetness level could be dialects down a bit. Service was attentive and very professional. Prices were on the high side which is why visits are reserved only for special occasions.

Had a thoroughly enjoyable evening here. Have been to all of Violet Oon's restaurants so far and this has been the best for me. Food was great. Had the chicken satay which was chunky and flavourful. You don't really need the sauce but that was delicious too. The sea bass dish with the sambal chilli was great with the sambal having pieces of crispy dried shrimp. With the chinchalok the contrast of flavours was fantastic. The nasi goreng pedas had us craving for more though we could have taken it a bit more spicy. The cocktails I tried (Prinseps Tea and Pegu Club) were of good quality. Service was very good. Knowing we could not decide between the chendol and pulut hitam, they actually threw in the chendol on the house. Both desserts were mouthwatering. Overall for the ambience, service and quality of food and drinks, I will be returning to this outlet.
5
Presentation of food was top notch. Every dish tasted above expectations. Must try - beef rendang, dry Laska and pork satay. I especially liked the various types of chili sauce offered.
5
Nicely designed restaurant with well spaced seating and a variety of levels.. service was good, little slow in making the cocktails but were attentive.
Food was nicely presented for local food, tasted good and was reasonably priced for the setting
5
Food and service have always been excellent. Glad that the staff who called to confirm my reservation is a lot friendlier this time. Bravo to the management. Coming back again in June.
5
Everytime I visit this place I always order the S'pore Sling (better than Raffles Hotel) and Tripe Satay.
If you are lucky, Violet drops in to say hi.
4
Celebrated my sister's birthday at the restaurant and my family and I were truly impressed with the professional and attentive yet personal service shown by the staff. Food was as usual excellent by Violet's standard.
5
I visited for dinner with friends. The menu was well priced for a local chef and the food didn't disappoint. There were not many options for vegetarians but upon asking our host, the chef was able to accommodate a vegetarian diet. Highly recommend the meatless meatballs and the ice cream for dessert.
5
I was quite wary of the hype and buzz about the food before I stepped into the restaurant. It didn't help when my friends reminded me not to be late as we might have to vacate by 8 pm due to the limited availability of seats. However, I was overwhelmed by the service (really excellent!) .They served with pride and confidence, interacted well and have good knowledge of the food. The food was really above expectations and upgraded the simple satay to a cuisine par excellence. I thoroughly enjoyed the beef rendang, babi ponteng and dry laksa. The tapioca cake and chendol are "must eat" desserts
4
Trendy and modern ambience with great music, service was fine but not great.The food was generally too Sweet.. the chicken satays are very juicy and well grilled however it is too sweet (both meat and sauces) Ngoh Hiang and Nasi goreng are very authentic with just the right taste. would rate the Keu Pie Tie below average as the cups are not crisp- fillings are fine. The fish with the cinchalok sauce is good - very refreshing but strong taste of prawns paste which is an acquired taste. Desserts are big portion- recommend to share. Improvements : i find it odd that coffee/tea are not available in this restaurant

This is the third Violet Oon restaurant in Singapore, named after and opened by this Singapore celebrity chef. The first one in the Bukit Timah neighbourhood focuses more on native Peranakan (a fusion of Chinese and Malay food) and the second in Singapore's National Gallery, offers a wider range of cuisines, including Eurasian, Western and Chinese. This latest one specialises in SE Asian satays and grilled food. Satays are a SE Asian favourite dish of meat on skewers but the ones here are no ordinary satay sticks; they are satays on steroids and much larger than the usual ones. They offer chicken, pork beef, prawn and even tripe satay skewers. These are pretty big portions and come with their own dipping sauces. The meats are juicy and delicious but I found the marinade too sweet for my liking, and the dips are also sweet. In addition to these meats on skewers, they also have a variety of grilled dishes—fish, beef and prawns. There are also five main dishes, which are a variety of stewed meats in different gravies and sauces. These all go very well with the delicious Nasik Lemak (jasmine rice cooked with coconut milk) as a side. The coconut rice serves as a nice counter to the heavily-seasoned mains. I would also highly recommend the Dry Laksa, which are noodles cooked with spicy gravy and prawns. The Noh Hiang is also highly recommended: it’s a soft spring-roll type dish that is stuffed with prawns, pork and crab and wrapped in bean-curd skin and then deep fried. It comes with a sweet dipping sauce and is out-of-this-world yummy.They also have some vegetarian options, including meatless meatballs (walnut and cheese dumplings braised in spices). For dessert, don’t miss the Chendol with Durian (an iced confection smothered with candied fruit, rice-flour jelly, red bean and topped with the very rich durian fruit. The Kueh Beng Kah (grated tapioca cake served with coconut cream and palm sugar) is also amazingly delicious. All in all, you’re guaranteed a very delicious, flavorful (but highly-caloric) meal

We had been looking forward to Violet Oon's cuisine and sadly couldn't get into either of the established venues at The National or Bukit Timah. We were offered the newer Satay Bar & Grill at Clarke Quay. Lovely interior with a mix of high and low tables. We had a delightful meal with delicious food -Sate was plentiful and delicious and Baramundi was divine! Buah Keluak Ayam was truly different and great to try something so unusual. Service, however, was rather over attentive and the courses rushed, which was a shame. As per a lot of Singapore it's not a cheap evening, but we felt it was justified to a point:The whole evening was then marred, however, by the fact you have to use public toilets in the nearby Clarke Quay! So you spend close on £175 for dinner for two (bottle of wine and 2 cocktails) and then have to walk about 300yards on a side road/walkway to a public (dirty and disgusting at 10pm) toilet! Really!! No! This even shocked my husband ...Enough to say this needs to be sorted or else eat somewhere else. We won't return sadly nor recommend it to anyone ... so many more great choices in Singapore. Previous reviewers have also commented on this so take note - it's not a fast food restaurant in a food court so sort it out!! At the very least warn diners before arrival so they can make an informed decision

lovely family dinner and a great place for a birthday celebration! excellent food & service, will be back again soon :)
4
Delicious food and great service. Best beef rendang ever! Very nice decor also. Strangely however, there are no toilets and one must the public toilets.
5
Great food, great service and great ambience. The satay (prawn and pork) were excellent. The service was very attentive, coupled with a nice interior made for an outstanding evening. Recommended!

Enjoyed the attention to detail in decor and dishes served. Good ambiance and nice dinner place - more for those who don't mind a bit of a chattier atmosphere.
5
Had a wonderful dinner at the relatively new Violet Oon Satay in Clarke Quay. Wasn't sure what to expect at this potentially touristy location but were pleasantly surprised. Maitre d seated us promptly at our nice quietish table (was a very busy Sat night) and though service a little slow to begin with the rest of the night was excellent. Satays amazing, generous serves and other dishes didn't disappoint either. Great value for the quality of food, gorgeous surrounds and overall experience. Only complaint is toilets are a bit of a walk away in a busier, much noisier part of Clarke Quay, not a nice experience
5
A group of us headed to Clarke Quay for a a night out and wanted to have local food for dinner at a place with a good ambience. Violet Oon's satay bar and grill promised and delivered just that and excellent service to boot. On the list to visit again on our next trip to Singapore

Violet Oon's Sarah bar and grill is now my favorite of her 3 restaurants!! The decor is beautiful and similar in style to the other 2 just bigger with more buzz! I love how they play the music audible enough just like in US restaurants! I hate how many Singapore restaurants have music played so terribly softly that all you hear is some irritating background noise cos it's so soft it doesn't sound like music!! Their satays here are sublime! We had the pork and beef satay! The beef rendang, fish with chilies, lemak chicken, ngor Hiang and even their desserts were fabulous!! I also love love love their lemak rice. The tall Indian manager was excellent! Very hands-on, very professional and really cared for the guests. Service staff were efficient as the restaurant was very busy and they had alot of clearing and serving to do!! All in all, I love the new outlet! Great food, excellent ambiance and efficient service!! Keep it up!!

My visit was on Sun 2 Apr. food was good but service was horrible - I am an easy-going diner, but this was a business meeting with an overseas associate; and I was raving about this restaurant even before dinner. what a letdown. really difficult to get the attention of the serving staff. I felt that they were disinterested. Even after a long time, no one came to offer to take the initial order for drinks (this being a bar+grill concept after all?). A/C was really freezing (blasting on both our heads), but even the request to turn it up a little was declined, citing that the next table would be warm - well, there wasn't even any effort to try, and perhaps ask the next table? a 2nd order of beer took so long to arrive, I had to get out of my seat to remind the staff (again it was impossible to get their attention). For a good bar, how long could it take to dispense a beer - seriously? this place really does violet oon a disservice coz she's a respected ambassador of local cuisine

I was captivated by interior design and decoration of the restaurant. As if I was in a house belonging to a Peranakan. Kudos to the effort put in! The food was great as well, flavorful and it suited my palate just well. The service I received was great as well, the waiters and waitresses were very attentive
5
Went there with a group of friends . It's best to share all the dishes so you can sample more of the menuThe satay is definitely one of their best offerings and the meat is well marinaded and grilled to perfection, slightly burnt at the edges as it is meant to be. They are big chunks of meat , not mince . We also enjoyed the barramundi with Assam and pineapple chunks which lent a refreshingly piquant flavor to the very fresh meat. We enjoyed the durian chendol as the green chendol is not hard, as it is usually the case with commercially prepared chendol, and I was told they make it themselves. For those who do not like durian , a non durian version can be made as a special request. The nonya chap chye was also a hit with some of the group,In all a thoroughly enjoyable meal and we will definitely be back for more

Ordered the pork satay 7/10
Baby pong Teng 6/20
Cap Chai 6/20
Fried rice 6/10
Ice chendol 8/10
Overall Average

Fantastic service and food. Highlights we're the pork satay, beef rendang and tapioca cake. Enjoyed speaking with the manager/chef about the dishes and learning how they were prepared - really added to the experience. Very enjoyable evening.

Had the juiciest, most tender satay ever here! Been a big fan of Violet Onn National Kitchen and her Satay Bar & Gril, once again exceeded all expectations. Other than the Satay, the other dishes were absolutely delicious. Do end the night with the gula melaka ice-cream and the durian chendol - its to die for! And a big shout out to the team there headed by Raj - you guys are the best! Will definitely be back for more! (this was my 2nd visit there!
5
Was here for dinner with my family as we were celebrating my sisters birthday. The food was delicious and needless to say, the satay was really yummy. I especially enjoyed the chicken and pork satay. The tripe satay was my least favourite of the three that we tried but my sister thought it was good. For mains we ordered the grilled ribeye, barramundi and Nasi goreng. All our main dishes were Super yummy and I loved the Nasi goreng - although it was a tad too spicy for me. Nice that they included a spicy and less spicy version on their menu. But perhaps they ought to have a completely non spicy version for kids and adults who can't tolerate Chilli well. For dessert, the durian chendol was the clear winner and we basically licked it clean. And this is coming from someone who isn't a particularly big fan of durians! Will definitely be back to try the rest of the dishes
5
Great location and atmosphere coupled with superb friendly service. Not forgetting the delicious food served. I went back twice in a week! The satay is a must have! I'm not a beef eater but my friends who've tried highly recommend it. One cannot leave the place without trying their gula melaka ice cream and chendol- it's sinful but so worth the sin! I'm definitely going back soon

Unable to secure a table at the National Gallery, we visited the latest Oon restaurant at Clarke Quay. It has the same dark paneling and gilt fitting ambience as her Gallery restaurant, which my wife and I found quite attractive and restful. Things became less restful as the restaurant became crowded but that was not a problem. We did not want a large meal and ordered three different sates and a Nyoongar Nasi Goreng. The sates were tender and with excellent accompanying sauces. The Nasi Goreng was good, with a proper egg served on top. Service was very professional and efficient. Wine prices are what you expect in Singapore. Not cheap, but wine is available by the glass if you don't want a bottle. Highly recommended but make a reservation

Went there for dinner on 6 March. The Prawn satay was not fresh and the satay sauce was atrociously bad. Serving size for every dish was small, even the coconut rice was miserly. Don't go there as you can get much better food for one fifth of the price charged. They will need to raise their food and service standards quickly as diners will not return with so many better food outlets on offer in Singapore. $400 plus for 5 people is really over the top for such poor standard food and service

After having such a sublime meal at Violet Oon's restaurant at the National Gallery we decided to try her new satay bar. It's a noisier restaurant suited to the area. We had the pork hainan satay and prawn satay with the pork satay winning in the flavour contest. We also had the Kunyit Lemak Satong (grilled squid on a creamy turmeric sauce) which was extremely tasty. The servings seemed smaller than the National Gallery restaurant and the wine pour was definitely on the light side. All in all a good night out. The staff were good especially considering they had only been open less than 2 weeks
4
First time at this new satay bar and grill by Violet Oon and I must say that it is all worth it! Very good and tasty Kueh Pie Tee to start with and a series of well grilled and flavourful pork, chicken and beef Satays ! Those Satays are good on their own even without the peanut sauce. The beef and chicken were my favorite ! The meatless meatballs surprised us and we ordered 2 servings in a row. Hae bee hiam seabass and the Mee siam dry are must order . We also tried the Nasi goreng and it was with no regrets. After all the food, there wasn't much space left for desserts but this place is worth a second visit and more! It closes at 12 midnight and you may swing by for some drinks by the bar if not the food too :

This restaurant is one that does not disappoint, especially when you are looking for some wonderful Peranakan dishes with a good environment. The Satay Bar & Grill outlet also features the same few signature dishes served in their other outlets. In addition, the grilled food and satay were really really good. I'd highly recommend the "Hei bee hiam grilled sea bass with cincalok". Go for the satay as well! If you are into cocktails, "Haliatini" is what I would highly recommend, it's a ginger-based concoction and it was really refreshing.My family also had the opportunity to meet Ms. Violet Oon herself on the evening we were there for a farewell dinner for my uncle. Ms. Violet played a really good host, as she was walking around and chatting with the diners.I also want to use this opportunity to thank Ms. Jean for her outstanding service, as she was one of the most helpful service staff I have ever met. Bumped into her twice at the National Gallery outlet, and this time, in this newest outlet. Thank you so much
