Excellent Japanese food in Liang Court. Great value for money. Decent variety on the menu. Friendly staff.

Happened to be shopping at liang court and stumbled upon this place. Have a craving for soba and therefore, visited this restaurant, or maybe a food bar.More like a food court concept but the food was ok, not bad at all. In view of the price, I gave it a four stars

My meal was great. I order Toriten Ju and Mini Soba. It is a set meal with Chicken Tempura on Rice with Lacquered Box & Small-Sized Soba. The meal was sufficient for me to share with my daughter. The chicken was similar to the karaage chicken, very tasty. Seats were around the restaurant, similar to those eatries you see in Japan. Service was efficient
