Have eaten here several times, mostly for dinner. Takeaway is also available. The menu is generally simple cantonese style Chinese food, with rice, noodles and soup predominating. My favourites are the roast meat (char siu, siew yok) rices, which come with vegetables and pickles. The soups are reasonable as well. Service is fast and efficient, and the food is served quickly. Not a place to linger and chat, but come for reasonably priced fuss-free food
