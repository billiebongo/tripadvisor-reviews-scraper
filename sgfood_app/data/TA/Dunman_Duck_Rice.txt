Haven't been able to pop over for more than 6 months even though i live nearby. Still as good as before. stall owners can still recognise me. :)

This was well priced and a delicious and warm dish. I would heartily recommend this place. It's off the beaten track and I only found it due to being with a local.

Just like any braised duck rice hawker stall. Its at the basement of the food court and is the last to close at night.

It is a mixture of duck rice + Kway Chap (braised sides like boiled egg, fish cake, pig intestine, tau pok and pig skin). Not suitable for non intestine parts lover.

being in the east side and some 15 mins away from town, this place is very local. it was not that crowded at lunch time but we still had to wait a good 20 mins. the braised duck is very tender and delicious. the kway chap (pig intestines and bits) did not have the porky smell which is excellent. the 'kway' which is large flat rice noodle pieces and the soup are so yummy! it is a worth the drive here, but parking may be a bit of a problem. nevertheless, this is one good hawker food centre to come to.

decent enough, doesn't have that "ducky smell", it's boneless. it's not bad, but somehow people from the nearby churches would flood the stall, I'd advice to give Sunday lunch a miss or be prepared to wait 40mins. food quality is the same as before but auntie is getting snobbish. my regular braised duck stall since young.
