Very good prawn noodle at Pek Kio food center. Always long lines but worth the wait. The soup is delicious and yellow noodle tangy.

We dined at this Market which was only a short walk from Forest By Wangz, unique market situated in housing area and mainly locals eating out. We thoroughly enjoyed our meals which were priced for the local residents.

The price you pay for the prawn noodles is really value for money. It's only $2.50 per bowl, yet the quantity is very substantial. There is usually a long queue during lunch time. So if you don't want to queue too long for it, then try to get there before 12pm.
