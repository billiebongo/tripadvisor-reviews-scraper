Chinese good at reasonable prices. The Peking duck was good and they do the balance of the duck in a tasty way - diced duck wrapped in lettuce. Service was good

Good for classic Chinese food, the prices are the same of most of the other restaurants in the area. Well served with pleasant service.

Hungry people come here :) Big portions, delicious food, friendly staff and quick service. We were positively surprised!

Located inside a mall this is a bustling place and the food was delicious - we had some dim sum dishes that were really good and ordered some pork belly to go. Service was great. Fresh ingredients and popular with the locals.

Nice restaurant for some fine dining, inside a shopping mall in Chinatown. We loved the food. But there is no doubt, they should improve the service. But we chose this restaurant for the food.

Few times had dinner in this restaurant, the service is good but unfortunately we had waiting for our dish for more than 1 1/2 hours and is not only our table there are few customers also waiting until u can see their angry face is incredible!! Service staff keep help us to ask and they keep apologies to us although they just few of them and busy working but they are trying to apologise with others customer also. I know the restaurant is a little busy but u can't let customers to wait so long and some dish we already finish but others still not yet come within the same time and the food is so so only...
