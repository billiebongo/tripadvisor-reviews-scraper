A warm and friendly establishment with excellent Thai bar food. Look for Ivan, the manager, and his excellent crew.....simply wonderful service...all helmed by Nithi who runs a tight ship. Well Donrle Team!

We went here at 6pm ( obviously outside was busy with workers post work drinks) we sat inside and ordered a number of the starters to share; 6-7 were ample for a family and the food was tasty and for Singapore good value.
5
I went here for a welcoming reception of one specific event. The finger food offer and salad was so good and they offer no pork options. The waitresses was very friendly and kept the food coming. Good interior. I would be happy to come again!

This is a great place to have business lunches especially when it is very near to my office. However, recently I had problems making reservation. The contact no. indicated on their website and tripadvisor (65321319) is always not answered and there is no voicemail either. Only managed to get thru and make reservation via another no. 65323117 when I googled through thefullertonheritage.com. Reservation was taken by a lady (which I shall not revealed her name) and she seems to have difficulties understanding English. Having said these, I hope there will be some improvements

Sat outside and enjoyed the views. Restaurant was busy so service a little slow. To be honest I found the food just ok - the curry was reasonable, the pad Thai a little small. Prices though were high, obviously due to their harbour-front spot, so I'd come here for the location and the vibe but not if you just want some decent Thai food and couldn't care less about the view or the clientele.
5
My wife and i dined with our god daughter and all of us ordered a local chicken curry, which was amazing. Served in individual saucepans and cooked to your preferred intensity. The flavours were amazing, service great and even the drink prices were reasonable, for the location
3
Went for a casual drinks and dinner with work colleagues after office hours. Good service and had some good appetizers whilst drinking sitting outside. Went into the brasserie for dinner. Fantastic lamb mussaman. Advice you to skip the wine selection - stick to beer. Great service
4
The menu spreads evenly between the cuisine of Indochina. Tastefully done in fusion serving, each dish brings out the speciality of its original charms! Must try includes pork nuckle, lamb shank in green curry and huge prawns tossed with balacan chilli. The ambience soothes your savoury with a bayside dining and great Kirin on tap. Popular among the office crowd and it's nestled among other modern eateries making it an signature enclave! Price is a bit steep
4
Went for after work drinks and made full use of the happy hour on the draft beer.Efficient and attentive service was appreciated.Out side seating offers a great view too of Marina Bay sands. if your a traveler the bar has wifi and is within easy walking distance of Raffles place. will try the food next as h3jat we saw looked goo
5
In CBD, this place serves a good flair of fusion cuisine (Jimbaran prawns are amazing!) Best calamari I've had in CBD so far; Lamb shank is yummy as well. Ground level and has alfresco sitting. Good selection of drinks and cocktails. Extremely pleasant staff and a manager that is attentive to details
4
Restaurant is very good but not outstanding in every aspect that one could qualify: food, service, location, décor and price (for Singapore standards, of course).
Outstanding soups when compared to the overall menu.
4
We arrived today in this beautiful city and after a long walk under a 33 Celsius (but felt like 42) we decided to try this place. It was great! Delicious from the beginning. Great service. Good location. But you have to love chilies.
3
Not really the most spectacular restaurant in Singapore. The food is pretty average and the menu does not offer enormous choice. The ambience is pretty average as well.
4
The place is very conveniently located, right in the business and entertainment area. We had the set lunch, and it was quite good.
4
The food was tasty and service efficient. This fairly new opening has not yet been discovered by the crowds at Raffles Place /MBFC.
If you want an Asian type lunch as an alternative to Sabai Thai next door, this is a good bet.
4
We went in to Longtail for a quick business lunch and were impressed by both the speed of service as well as the quality of the food.
The menu was good, with a great choice and at a reasonable price.
4
Reduce the time for serving and this is a 5 star place. Really warm welcome followed by a push for charcoal grilled squids. No complaints there as the squids were worth every push (and dollar). Not cheap but the location and the variety makes up for that. Can do again.
4
It was a nice spot to sit and relax after a long walk around the whole Marina Bay. The terrace is nice with a wonderful view to the Marina Bay hotel. Also at the evening it is the best spot where to watch the night light show. The waitress was incredibly nice and smiley (her colleague not). They have pretty good drinks (I say pretty because I am comparing it with other places in Singapore) and the prices are a little higher. After all I recommended this place
4
I go here for one reason: Antarctica. This is my absolute favourite cocktail ever. I don’t know exactly how they do it, and it costs a fortune, but wow. So when I’m craving my Antarctica, I usually end up eating here too, and it is quite good. All the little bites are yummy (I especially like the Luang Prabang salad & the veg bao) but the bill adds up! Yes it is pretty much a variation on the street food you can get elsewhere for a quarter of the price. But you are paying for the atmosphere, and the great view of Marina Bay Sands, as well.
5
Weren't we lucky to find this place and be served so warmly by Ivan Yong. The chicken wings and pork balls along with our Luang Prabang Salad were wonderful. Ivan immediately understood our request for gluten free food and responded immediately with some lovely choices. It is not easy travelling in Asia and finding restaurants that understand how important it is for GF people to avoid wheat. This is a great place. The view is great and the service very special.
4
This is a good place for a pint of kirin or guiness (both on draft) ideal when you stay at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The food menu is simple with sime asian food bites. I highly recommend this place for a drink near the marina.
3
Friendly staff and a great location just down from the Fullerton hotel on the waterfront. The menu lacked options and the food left a lot to be desired. Drinks were also quite expensive even with the happy hour offer.
3
Service was not the fastest and the waiter did not know his drink menu. Food was ok and the weather was good for an outdoor party of 45.
4
Longtail is quite a small establishment, tucked away on the quayside well off Collyer Quay road, between Clifford Pier and the old Customs House, and it's worth seeking out. You also should book ahead if you're going there for dinner, as we did, as this whole area is very popular at night. Inside is a dark wood decor with a long bar on one side and a dozen or so tables. There are some outdoor tables too. There's a really interesting menu which I'd describe as "modern Asian", with a degree of Italian fusion perhaps. Nearly half of the menu is of the "tapas" type (referred to as "Bar Bites") and we shared six or seven of these, which was sufficient for four of us.We tried Bo La Lot, for instance, which is yummy beef with lemongrass, rolled up in a betel leaf. Tam Sua is a green papaya salad with noodles - gorgeous. And there's lots more. Drinks are expensive as they are all over Singapore but the food prices were very reasonable, given the quality and variety. One caveat - the hard surfaced decor makes it very noisy, so don'g go in the evening for a quiet dinner
4
Good recommendation from fellow reviewers. A party of we went to this restaurant with high expectations. Did not get disappointed. Especially the Appetizers are delicious. Recommend to choose Chickenwings, Springrolls and the Papayasalad. The curry dishes could be a bit spicier, but that depends on the individual taste. Prices are acceptable.Will return
5
I love the food here. All food we order is delicious and even better taste than in Thailand in some menu. But the cocktail which is the best my favourite are long tail sling and Antarctica. Really good. I recommend this.Forgot to say service is excellent. This place is good in fixing the complain
3
Had their set lunch during my visit in March this year. The food was very average and the size of, especially the appetizer and dessert, was very poor. The ingredients used in these two items was also not up to par. The restaurant was saved by the great service provided
4
We stopped in for cocktails on a short stopover in Singapore. After two weeks of trying various mojitos, these were the best we'd had. Between our group of three we tried the classic, lemongrass, cumquat, and ginger mojitos. All were exceptional, sophisticated cocktails made with subtlety and finesse, my favourite being the cumquat. The dinner menu (modern Asian) looked excellent and we hope to dine here on our next stopover, as unfortunately we arrived too late for lunch, too early for dinner this trip.They are located on the water and close to Marina Bay MRT station, making this a pleasant and easy interlude between flights
5
Near the quay with a partial view of Marina Bay Sands. This is our second visit. We went around dinner time on a Saturday.We had grilled pork shoulder with premium fragrant Thai sticky rice and tamarind sauce and the crispy pork belly Pak Bao krapao. The Popiah soft Vietnamese spring roll was also delicious. Add a glass of RosÃ© de Provence for $12.5 and you get a good value for the money. Kuhn Niki was very friendly too.
3
I went early to this place to have a nice dinner--had heard good things.I went into the restaurant--I didn't want to eat on a table outside.the outside was really busy between 5:30 and 6:30--and I was about the only person inside.I was pretty much ignored and had to call over the server every time I wanted anything.The food, in my view, was very ordinary--nothing to complain about, but I wouldn't go back.I ordered a reasonably priced meal--and thought for sure it would come with bread--since the drink I ordered did not come with crackers or anything else. No bread.The area outside was really attractive overlooking the water-and the drinkers were plentiful and all seemed happ
5
Go for happy hour between 4.00 and 8.00pm and enjoy discounted wine and cocktail of the day. Great location in the Customs House building with very tasty dishes from around Asia.
4
the food was delicious. Particularly the Thai selection. I was soo full tasting the Bar Bites (very good) before going for next course (Will go again just to taste the big ones).
It would have been nice if they had bit more vegetarian options.
5
One of the best restaurant I have ever been to. Great food! The best in terms of Thai influence.
Very friendly and helpful staff. Always engaging. Amazing ambiance and view.
3
Food was limited, menu small. Staff great however. No ashtrays for cigarettes either so we had a battle to find creative places to throw cigarette butts which ended up being a pain in the butt!
4
Held a large group dinner for over 40 people at Longtail in November. The food was great, and the staff very helpful in arranging a menu for our budget per person. We were able to have all the tables inside assigned to our group so it almost seemed like we were in a private dining room. The staff were very helfpul and our group had a really fun night
5
Well if you like cocktails and don’t drink beer or wine make a point of going to the long tail bar[ they do serve these items also of course } - the staff are great , you can sit inside or out with great views, the service is efficient and friendly and every day they have promotions The menu of mojitos made this a real treat for us and we visited several times – Singapore is soooooo expensive and cocktails are the same price or more than home and that’s no fun when you are on holidays We did not try the food but the atmosphere and location of this bar make it a real treat- Singapore needs more places like this one Keep an eye out for the promotions and try all of the mojitos options excellent quality and generous drinks the lemongrass, the ginger, the original, the orange and the passionfruit we loved them all Thanks to the long tail bar a trip a return trip to Singapore is worth looking forward t
5
I've recently visited Longtail a few times for social events and meetings with friends after work. The location is amazing: in the centre of the CBD but in a relatively quiet environment away from the main streets. Food is very good- especially for the "fusion lovers" and service is incredibly good
5
Great location on the bay in Singapore. The only thing that would make it better would be outdoor seating to enjoy the view. The waiter was very good, attentive, knowledgable and wanted to show off his knowledge of cool cocktails. The food was stellar - Lamb Shank Curry was fabulous and I heard that the Chicken & Rice dish was also great. I will definitely be back given that the food was really good, the price was reasonable for Singapore, and the service was also spot on. Definitely back for next tri
4
We had a good dinner by Longtail. Dishes are well prepared and good flavored.We also had a very good mojito. If you go for happy hour you can get a discount on the price for drinks.Just one note: the meat of my vietnamese main dish was not so tender.. it had many nerves
3
Was curious to try out this place due to its tripadvisor ranking. Nice ambience and decor ,and situated in customs houseThey have a set lunch for $25 and they make a lot of profit for the drinks - $6.50 for a coke, $9 for a bottle of sparkling water, $6 for coffee etc. , so it all adds upWe also ordered a vietnamese spring roll to share and the prawns in the spring roll was of a generous size. But it's $12. The set lunch started with a small thai salad which was ok.Then it was prawn + rice or cambodian/laotian noodles. They don't tell you the noodles are very spicy. And we had to eat it very gingerly in case the deep red gravy splashes onto our suits. Dessert was a coconut based sago dessertOk food and ambience but at $43 per person, this is the same price at a 5 star restauran
5
After a stroll along the quay, we ended up on the lovely outside terrace of Longtail where we thoroughly enjoyed great cocktails and dinner, served by a friendly Korean waitress. Nice place for a romantic night out or hanging with friends. Worth checking out!
5
Great spot for casual dining or just nibbling on some snacks after work while enjoying Interesting cocktails prepared with passion and attention to detail. Unique and well selected choice of spirits and liqueurs.
Asian Food with a creative twist.
Relaxed setting and attentive service.
5
Had lunch at the longtail today for the first time and it was amazing. I had a sandwich with pork but it was the Asian spices and Chilli which just made it perfect. I think the blend of Vietnamese, Laotian sort of an Indochina element works really well. The drink with passion fruit was also ideal with the food I ate. Highly recommend eating here
2
(Since I find Tripadvisors translation bad I will try (on my not so perfect english) translate my rewiev after the swedish version)Vilken besvikelse! Förväntningarna var höga med tanke på den höga rankningen på tripadvisor men restaurangen är inte ens medelmåttig. Gott vin och fina ostron men maten var ingen höjdare. Absolut inget speciellt!What a disappointment! Expectations were high given the high ranking on tripadvisor but the restaurant is not even mediocre. Good wine and fine oysters but the food was nothing special
5
Recently i was in Singapore for a week end and i had the opportunity to visit longtail. This venue has generated a lot of hype so i thought id check it out. Definitely a good move.I enjoy places that are unpretentious and just offer great food and beverage... Longtail does just that....serving real Guinness on tap, i talking with the Manager Jan he informed me the barrels are imported direct from Dublin a rearey to find a decent guiness on tap these days in Asia.The bar food is tasty and precise, great flavours, texture and variety. I would recommend the Bahn mi, steamed buns, and pork knuckle all excellent dishes.Jan, explained the range of artesian spirits, ciders and craft beers on offer all of which i enjoyed and would come back for the interesting selection alone.This venue is for me.... unlike the hype of over pretentious Hotel environment that is found all over Singapore a great little bar restaurant run by passionate professionalsThe guys told me that there Sister restaurant Sabai (next door)is a must try which will be first on my list on my next trip to Singapore.Do yourself a favour and try this venue..
3
Came here for a quick business lunch, both the starter a Thai fruit salad and the desert a Vietnamese cake were pretty ordinary, the main; Burmese chicken curry was good.the place has got decent ambience and all and they had some innovative cocktails on offer the place might be better for an evening drink
4
We went there on a rainy day for lunch. There weren't many people around. I ordered a glass of Prosecco. At first the server gave me a stale one so I told her immediately about the wine condition and she quickly took it away, a minute later the manager came and apologized and replaced it with a fresh one. Good service so far. Then we ordered some appetizers, pho noodle, braised beef with rice vermicelli, it was delicious, all of them, well it is not really 100% authentic but we love the taste. Will go back there again and try some more dishes.
5
I went to Longtail through a friend's recommendation and I wasn't disappointed. The place is nice and relaxing (even though it was quite full when we were there). Great place to hang out with friends. Cocktails are good and strong! I had mojito and negroni and both are very good. The food is great too! Being Thai myself and exposed to all kinds of street food, the food is very tasty and quite authentic. Must try grill pork shoulder and the chicken bao. Will definitely return again next time when I'm in Singapore
5
A group of us went here for the jazz & old fashioned cocktail night recently. A great time was had by all. The atmosphere is nice, bring in the Customs pier. The food is good quality, there is a good selection of 'boutique' beers and the owner & staff are friendly. We'll definitely be back soon
2
One would never go to a pan-European restaurant serving French, Italian and Spanish food in search of a gastronomic experience. Similarly, one should be very weary of a pan-Asian eatery serving Chinese, Japanese, Lao, Thai and Vietnamese dishes - unless, of course, one is completely ignorant of Asian cultures. This is what LongTail is - a bar (with good wines and drinks) by and for Gwai Lo (鬼佬)! The chicken bao are no better than those at 7-Eleven; the rice paper wrapping the Vietnamese spring rolls is broken because it's too wet; the phở (which tastes better than its unappealing look would suggest) is served without the complete assortment of fresh herbs, and one has to ask for the Sriracha chili sauce (it is served with chili oil, which Chinese eat, but not Vietnamese.) The food is OK, but it's certainly not the real thing. It's not even 'modern' Asian (that ceviche may be an attempt to imitate Nobu, but sorry, it aint't!) If you want good and authentic Asian cuisines and still enjoy the beautiful Marina Bay Sands view, go to Sabai Customs House next door (for Thai), Jing on One Fullerton (for Chinese), etc. And yes, prices are many times what these dishes would cost at decent restaurants in other parts of Singapore
4
Pleasant seating outside. The service is very friendly and efficient. The food was tasty, but it wasn't cheap and I still left hungry
5
Very very nice n best food in this restaurant. I have visited with my family. And that is the best time with my family.
3
If this is the best that Singapore has to offer, then it's very overrated. Come to that, so is Singapore.
4
It was very quiet for a Saturday night, but we found the place very relaxing with great service. We had the lamb shank massamun curry which was pretty good. Sat outside which was very nice. Sabai Restaurant is next door. Worth a visit
3
it is a good place to have a salad or a vietnamese meal (Bo Bun). The food is oriented on vietnamese specialities. The terassse is nice also and a nice spot close to the CBD and the marina bay. Watch out prices as, a beer pint and a beef salad cost 18 boxes each. Please don t try desert they are over priced and not good at all...We tryed 4 types of deserts...no one was good....to avoidI would say a good place for tourist while walking on the bay, if you are from Singapore thus not a good choice.The service was good also, nice peopl
4
Went here because of the tripadvisor reviews. It was just as expected. Reasonable prices for the otherwise expensive area (at least during the 50%-off-driniks happy hours, which last till 8pm). Food OK, although the lamb shank others have spoken well of turned out to be a bit sweet for our taste. They also have live music, with different acts each night of the week. A pleasant experience
4
With a small group of people we shared some starters which where excellent. I had the Lamb Shank and that was great.After an unfortunate accident resulting being showered with beer, they kept my shirt for cleaning and did send it all the way back to Amsterdam (Cleaned of course)
4
We visited this restaurant simply because it was no.1 on trip ..... not so easy to find, ..however.. it was well worth the effort as the food was fantastic ! so good we ordered a second round ! would really recommend you visit this restaurant and you can find it in Customs House ( which we had failed to notice ! 
4
I was taken to this place by the businessmen that I had come to Singapore to meet. The place is a bit loud, but the food is good, the service was friendly, and it was clean. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there again, but I wouldn't say no if invited again. All together a great experience
5
Great place to hang out for after-work drinks - cold beer, great finger food, excellent service! Jan and Ivan are genuinely friendly and easy-going folks. If you're hungry and can take spice, ask for the chicken curry. It is crazy good. The view of the Bay doesn't hurt either.Longtail is officially our new Local
5
Excellent food, service, decor and ambience. A very relaxed atmosphere.
Highly recommended for lunch and for evening drinks & snacks.
Try the Guiness!
The area is developing into a great spot.
5
perfect place to relax & unwind after work/day or TGIF! Great service, very attentive - truly Thai hospitality.. Can even have an excellent dinner at Sabai then carry on the night at this bar. Superb!!
5
I have visited Longtail since it first opened in Dec 2013. There are a tons of bars in the Raffles Place area but this has got to be the best. Great view of the MBS area, friendly and attentive staff, good quality food without the silly prices and good selection of drinks. Highly recommended
5
was there yesterday for some drinks with friends. Service was good even though the bar start to get busy. Truly Thai hospitality......... My friend ordered a bot of promotion whisky, Glenfiddich 15yrs @ $210.... guess what, complimentary food and premium Thomas Henry mixers was given. Value for money........Overall, food is good, drinks is good, service nothing to say (Impressive). Must visit restaurant & bar in Singapore and you have good views of Marina Bay sands. Oh, almost forget to mention the delicious Guinness draught that i ordered as well.......... :
5
I heard about this new concept "Thai-Brasserie". It's located in the Customs House at the Fullerton Bay Hotel. I took a seat of one of the two outside terrace. The terrace was well occupied and the service was very fast to serve every dish. I ordered the "Antartica" Gin Tonic. The only thing I could say: DELICIOUS! My food order was some Bangkok Balls, Chicken Bao, the grilled pork shoulder and the Longtail Boat soup. The taste was gorgeous, every dish lovely decorated and hot served. The service was every time very friendly and gave me the feeling of taking care of the customer. The German owner and his wife created a unique and outstanding restaurant in Singapore. One of my best dining experience during my stay. I will definitely come back and recommend everybody to make his own culinary experience. You will not be disappointed
5
Have been visiting Longtail since it opened. Jan and his team are perfect hosts and nothing is too much trouble. Great selection of drinks, including beers specially ordered upon request, if you become a regular! The food menu has a wide variety of exquisite Asian dishes...something for everyone. Thoroughly recommend this place!
5
Here it starts... Was passing by the street & saw a name "Longtail". Wondered what is this as it says Asian "Brasserire". Never heard that !!! So got tempted to try what this new concept has to offer. It was happy hour & guess what MY favourite Guiness Draught at just SGD 9 ! What a deal & they have happy hour every day from 4-8pm. Made it on right time for few rounds of beer. This price really helps when you with a bunch of thristy friends !!! ;)Tried few bar snacks, to highlight few best from those were the Thai Chicken Curry Bun and the grilled pork shoulder and best of all my fav was fresh vietnamese spring rolls. I most liked the presentation of food which dishes out on wood boards giving an urban feel to it matching the concept what Longtail has tried to establish. A must try place and good luck for this fairly new place !!! Will see you soon on my next visit to Singapore
5
Finding something that fills a need that you did not know you had is always fun! Taking street food from around Asia to a innovative true to its roots but different bistro style sets the stage. Great stage looking out over the Singapore marina. With innovative Asian twist mojitos, good house wines, and great service, it is a wonderful place to come, hang out, catch up with friends and watch people. A great addition to the Singapore scene
5
We stumbled upon this place while visiting Singapore for the first time. We were looking for a place to grab a quick lunch and just happened to be walking by. I opted for the set lunch which was a noodle dish (Luang Probang??). It was delicious! My fiance had some curry chicken bun dish which she loved. Also tried the lemongrass mojito per the bartenders recommendation which was very good. Very refreshing in the heat and humidity! Staff was friendly and polite. The view of the bay is very nice. Very reasonably priced compared to most of the places I went for lunch in Singapore. Hope to go again if I ever get to return to Singapore
5
My favourite place for after work drinks! The drinks are very good, the G&T is one of the best in the city! Food is good and reasonable. I really like the idea of creative Asian bar bites! And the view is priceless ( you look directly at MBS)! For me the best place for after work drinks
4
Nice place to enjoy the breeze with some ice cold beers or liquors~
Do grab their bites, simple but yet delicious~

The unique Asian flavours of the food and the wines made our dining experience a memorable one. It's a great location and the bar bites are unique and tasty. Try the Vietnamese Fresh sping roll and the Chicken (green curry) bao !
5
Longtail Asian Brasserie offers a great selection of really tasty and typical dishes from Thailand, Vietnam and Laos, moreover the location is convenient, with a lovely view of the Marina area.
5
This new Asian Brasserie has a lot ot offer! It's ideally located at Custom House with spectacular views of Marina Bay. The beverage list features an eclectic mix of unique cocktails as well as wines, beers and spirits that have clearly been selected by someone with a great understanding of quality.I had an "Antarctica" - a really new and refreshing take on Gin Tonic. The perfect drink to be enjoyed on the large outdoor terrace. Gin-lovers will be happy to find Hendricks and Sipsmith on the list as well. The food menu is a real down-to-earth selection of Southeast Asian snacks and comfort food, such as Fresh Vietnamese Spring Rolls with Prawns & Pork (classic!), Deep-fried Sour Pork Sausage (awesome) and Vegetarian Bao, with Vegetables, Mushrooms and Green Curry (that was my favourite!). I look forward to returning to this little oasis during my next trip to Singapore..
5
Perfect hang out place with good food and drinks!! You must try their "must try" drinks Anarctica (Frozen Gin & Tonic) and Longtail Dark n Stormy (Rum and Ginger Beer). Yummy! For the food, grilled pork shoulder with sticky rice and tempura vegetable and calamari were all very delicious!
5
I go to Longtail regularly for drinks with my friends and colleagues. I must say the place is definitely worth a visit. They have excellent bar bites with good range of alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks available. Prices are standard that you can find in anywhere in Singapore with Happy Hours prices available for wide range of drinks too. The service is awesome, nice view and friendly atmosphere. Keep up the good work guys. See you soon
5
Been travelling a lot to Singapore and always try to go to the new restaurants and bars...I've been to Longtail about 3 times already after their opening, and I thought they were all superb!I had a lunch couple of times and tried their set lunch, and they always had different menus (I was informed it changes every week). I loved their authentic Thai food, they were really delicious, especially along with their refreshing pitchers. I had Sangria and Lemonade ones, it was just perfect way to open up the appetite.Last time I went there (it was last week) with my colleagues from work. If you are looking for a "after-work" place for a nice bar snack, especially you are tired of those boring fried calamari and bbq chicken wings, I think this is perfect place. LOVED their Thai/Vietnamese bar snacks - so authentic. We again shared some nice pitchers and tried different types of cocktails, they were all really good. I loved their "Negroni" it was just amazing. Apparently they've been opened already 6 weeks and I was surprised to witness their consistency. I really hope they keep it going!
5
Fantastic Thai Street Food is served in carefully selected tableware. The dishes are nicely prepared and taste delicious. The variety of drinks is absolutely impressive. Whisky and Gin lovers will like the place and Jan's own creations are better than ever. Only the waitress showed a little lack of flexibility but this did not harm a perfect evening at Longtail
5
Longtail has gotten it just right: great location, great views, awesome cocktails and simple, delicious, fresh, finger-licking good food. Practically all our drinks and dishes had a playful little twist - a rich cardamom flavour in the ice tea, thai filling in the dumpling, tuna-dish served in the can - that shows the Longtail people have a lot of attention to detail and while having a lot of fun as well. Great place
5
A great place with ambience in the heart of the new Downtown. Fluid restaurant/bar with outdoor & indoor set-up at the historical Custom House site. Excellent place to relax with family, friends and work mates. Jovial & warmth hospitality led by Jan himself and service crew. Authentic Asian dishes cooked to perfection and complemented with creative and tasteful drink menu. It is our new regular hangout place
