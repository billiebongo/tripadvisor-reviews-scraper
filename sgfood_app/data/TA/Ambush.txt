Food wise average, not a lot of varieties. Staffs are quite attentive, overall still not bad for a place for dinner.
4
excellent place for affordable lunch. Set meal is decently priced and lots of variety. Quality is good. Service is average though.
5
Love the truffle fries! The sausages platter were delicious too! Overall service was good and the ambience was just nice for a get together with a friend. Will definitely visit again!
3
Tried their waffles breakfast dish - I was ambushed by how incredibly average this tasted. Unlikely to return.
4
good place if you dont want to spend too much for food. Portion is good and set menus are highly recommended.
4
Portion of the food was big enough for sharing. And the food was good. Service staffs were polite and helpful..
4
Nice restaurant with good service. Recommend to make reservation to avoid disappointment as the seating are limited during peak hours.
5
Savour the melt in your mouth experience with each chunk of the 36 hour slow braised oxtail. Wala!!!
4
Many nice dishes served here, but my favorite is the chicken schnitzel! Really crispy and tender and tastes so good! We also had the white wine vongole and grilled mini sausage platter before which were tasty too. Perfect place for good, affordable food and if you need to catch a quick lunch in between shopping or catching a movie at GV Bishan
4
we found ourselves at Ambush again. decided to try the Fish & Chips while Bae had duck confit. opted for the dessert upgrade. waffles were nice, so was our mains. Only thing was while the girl staff wore gloves to prepare our dessert, the manager assisted with the condiments using his bare hands!!
5
Hidden in a corner at Bishan Junction 8, Ambush serves delicious pork kunckle, clams/mussels and spaghetti. The portions are big, so order appropriately.
4
Good range of weekday lunch items available for the set which comes with soup or drinks. The fish & chips were a good sized portion ;)
4
We were welcomed immediately into the restaurant as there wasn’t any queue. The food was delicious. Will definitely go back for more!!
4
Food was good but the ceiling aircon is leaking. The tables for 2pax are sitting under the leaking aircon..
4
If you can, go for their set lunch, very worthy. Otherwise, try their cook mussels or clams, you will like it :)
4
Loved the English Fish and Chips as well as coffee at Ambush (Junction 8) :) It will be great if the service staff were more attentive to us , we need to wave for quite a while before they could see us to assist with the refill of water and sauces.

Went there with family for dinner before flying back to London. First time trying it and was recommended by a friend. Not disappointed. Extensive menu of European favourites like pasta, German fare and french. I had duck and waffle for the first time. Unfortunately the duck was over cooked and dry. My dad has the squid ink pasta which he enjoyed. My sis had the German sausage with rosti which is not bad. My brother in-law had the pork Knuckle with sausage. The German fare could be a bit more generous. My mum has the fish and chips with salt egg with was interested and quite tasty. Overall not a bad place to dine for European food at an affordable price. Will go there again .
3
service was ok but some tables very close together.food is fresh but nothing special as it was bland no seasoning quickly thrown together .... and in the end was an expensive bland non special burger. the carbonara had very fatty bacon and this was undercooked. pasta was acceptable.do not expect I'll waste $$ returning anytim
1
Went there for lunch with my family. It was busy as it's the lunch crowd. We were promted that the food might be slow as the kitchen is busy. But the food came soon. As we were seated near the cashier, I could hear what was going on. 2 ladies was asking for their bill and the cashier was polite and asked how was their food and if everything was alright. Right after they left, I went to the counter to pay for our lunch. This time the same cashier just showed me the bill without saying much. He was struggling with the card machine and lo and behold told me that I had to pay with cash as the credit card machine was faulty. Luckily I had enough cash with me. He was not apologetic and as polite with the customer earlier. It was not a good experience for me and I will not be returning any time soon
4
Always enjoy the food. My gal likes the kids meal especially. Their mocha is good too. Overall ambience improved after recent renovation. There are a few seats facing the salon opposite which I less prefer as the cold air from the air con will blow directly at my back. Food turns cold vet fast too
1
My mother had very serious diarrhoea after eating the seafood pasta which contained clams and mussels. Regrettably, she had over 10 episodes of the toilet over two days.
4
Service and food was quite alright but when asked for chilli sauces it took them quite a while to bring it to us.
4
went in October after the renovation in J8. food was much better. our duck confit and ribeye were so yumz.
4
Food & Ambience improved after renovation but still not enough service staff. Lunch crowd can be busy and service is slow. Set lunch now is Main + either Soup or Drink but previously, include Soup & Drink.
4
The food is nice especially the signature mussel/clams dish. Servers are polite and prompt. Will visit again.
4
Food isn't authentic but with the prices like this, we can close one eye and give it a try. However, coffee was really bad...
2
Only the mushroom soup was ok.
Sirloin steak came with 15% fat!! Hardly enjoyable :(
Service was rushed; not taking the cue from diner's readiness! This is supposed to be a full service restaurant, no?
Can't recommend this place at all!
4
Visited the restaurant at lunch time. Staffs are polite, friendly and professional. Food is good given the price is also good at lunch time. Ambiance is good too. I will go again.
3
They have a good selection of dishes and the tastes of the dishes never disappoints me. However, I feel that the place seemed to be understaffed because their staff were quite ill mannered and also took the wrong order. I could sensed that the staff seemed to be impatient and spoke in a rude manner. I will visit ambush again but not this outlet
4
The fish and chips is highly recommended.Chips are fried in truffle oil.Another dish is Norwegian salmon with chicken garlic sausage and pasta is worth trying as well.Quite a large portion for only $13.90.Their daily lunch set starts from $10.90 and comes with soup of the day and drinks
4
Staff is friendly and service is fast. Good spread of choices on menu. Can also top up to have soup and drinks at a discount.
4
Food wise was great but seated at corner seems like always being overlooked by servers.. took almost 20mins to serve the salmon and had to ask multiple times before being served finally..
5
Ordered the beef burger with potato wedges. Thick and juicy. Good value. Strange though that kids meal was for 6y and under, even though the portions were generous.
Good variety of European cuisine as the name suggests. At affordable pricing.
5
Staff took initiative to explain the difference between lunch sets and main menu. We love the food, quality remains after so many years.

A subway service disruption during the evening peak hours prompted a colleague and I to wander into Junction 8 Mall which sits right above the Bishan MRT Station. Most of the restaurants in the mall had a queue and Ambush was among a couple of restaurants that did not have a line. Ambush is part of a chain of casual, family friendly restaurants reputed to serve affordable European fare at affordable prices. It was our first time visiting this outlet which has a semi open concept and overlooks an airwell so the airconditioning was indiscernible. We ordered the squid ink risotto with soft shell crab (S$18.50++) and sausages with rosti (S$14.50++). The meal was a let down, with the factory-produced bockwurst sausages being the only saving grace. The squid ink risotto was greasy and wet, with a pathetic half portion of a tiny soft shell crab perched in the middle of the dish. We felt cheated as soft shell crab is a fairly cheap ingredient in Singapore but we were served only half of a baby soft shell crab when the menu depicted a full sized soft shell crab above the plate of risotto (see attached photo). One would not expect much of a simple dish like sausages with rosti. While the bockwurst were succulent and served piping hot, the rosti was cold and drenched in oil, suggesting that the rosti had probably been fried in bulk and sitting in the kitchen for some time. As the restaurant was only 75% occupied when we had our meal, we would have expected the chef to reheat the rosti and drain the salad leaves dry prior to plating. It was only the sausages that saved the meal from being rated 1/5
3
For appetizers, we ordered escargots and fried calamari. The former was average while the latter had bits of truffle oil and it's fragrant and very yummy. Strongly recommend the fried calamari. We also ordered the seafood marinara but found it just average. A member of the group ordered the squid ink risotto which was fragrant but a larger portion of soft shell crab would be better. We also ordered salmon and seafood paella which tasted great! Lastly we also ordered the chocolate dessert which tastes just right. We used the chope voucher and must say that users better read the fine print - multiple vouchers are not allowed to be used as Ambush is stricter. Saveur was generous and allowed us to use 2 vouchers we purchased. At the end of the day, it's just a $5 voucher we used instead of 2 $5 dollar voucher anyway and not a big deal after all
5
Interesting and wide spread of food to choose from. Food is delicious and appealing. Service staff is efficient in clearing messed utensils away from the table. Food is served reasonable fast after ordered and the staff is quick and sharp in taking order. Have enjoyed dining at the restaurant and will not hesitate to return and try other food
3
My friend and I had lunch there. My sirloin steak, supposedly a medium one, was a bit over-cooked, so a bit tough. My friend's fusilli with salmon fillet was quite alright. Even though it was not a big piece of fillet, at least it was a whole piece instead of chunks, so considered quite good already.
4
We are buying a friend farewell lunch as she has resigned. We are working as volunteers with the organisation she is working with. Her office is at Hougang. We wanted a place that is convenient, with good ambience and value for money. We are happy with the service also. We ordered salmon with sausage and pasta. We are very happy with the taste and portion. We also ordered escargots and calamari. Our only grouse is the salmon is a little overcooked although we specified at the beginning we wanted it done at medium. Although the fish is not overcooked, we are a little disappointed. Other than that, everything is great. Service was good too. We will definitely visit Ambush again and recommend to our friends
1
Reserved a table requesting for cushion seats for 3pax at 1215pm a day before and when we reached, we were told there were no more such available table. While a corner cushion seat had been reserved for someone else, other cushion seats had been taken up. Why, may I ask then, there be a box catered for special requests in chope?And was our reservation not note-worthy? Found a long strand of hair in the prawn and mussels pasta, highlighted to the staff who apologized and replaced a plate for us.However, no further enquiry on our dining experiences and apologies for the lack of hygiene.So much for a European restaurant.The way Customer's feedback was handled was atrocious...Disappointing and disgusted.Hopefully we do not see this type of service provided at other outlets. Thumbs down, definitely
5
Staff is very nice and friendly. I went there dining alone and staff pay attention to me well in case I need anything.
3
The lunch set deal was great! But unfortunately service was not so attentive and black face waiter..
4
We ordered a sausage plate and lamb shank. The sausage with the rossti was superb. The lamb shank was abit hard though. Staff are very friendly and helpful.
4
Arrived on time with a long queue outside Ambush. Luckily we choped! And our seat immediately upon arrival.
4
The pork knuckles were excellent. The garlic butter escargot was also very good. Would have been better if they served a bit of bread for us to mop up the fragrant melted butter. Also enjoyed the squid ink baby scallop pasta and duck confit.
4
Italian casual dining. Great variety of dishes available, although on the pricey side. We ordered truffle egg & toast and sausage Platter.
5
been there a few times and never disappointed. calamari is highly recommended! we order pasta and risotto, all were nice.
1
It is not my first visit with colleagues here for their set lunch. The only reason which keeps us returning to the restaurant is the good value set lunch. The food is good and worth the $. We could go there almost every Friday! However, their service is what restricts most of us.It is not the first time I am writing a feedback on Ambush Bishan Outlet. For my recent visit, there this male supervisor who was relatively rude. When we are confirming our orders, he stopped us by raising up his hand at our face to show the “stop” gesture. As we are one of the largest group there, 8 pax, i understand that it may be a little tough to reconfirm our orders, but I don’t think that hand gesture is necessary when my colleague is trying to help. The worse thing is when one of us in the group is done with our meal, he will come by and clear our plates, cutting in between our conversation to clear the plates. One by one he came and took the plates away. I did not realized till my colleagues pointed out that he don’t see male supervisor doing that to other tables. We do not understand why is he doing such a thing perhaps our group is too huge that he hopes to clear up our table asap. It was the worse experience in Ambush. Now we are not going back there even when the food is great and value for money

Has been wanting to bring mum to try the Signature fish and truffle chips since I tried it about a month ago. We both agreed that the beer marinated fish fillets and truffle fries were indeed very good. Some fish and chips served elsewhere has very soggy fish fillets which were yucky but not her!! Mum loves it just as I do. My kid is a great lover of rissotto, so I thought I will try the Rissotto with Pancetta and Foie Gras on her behalf. I must say that the Foie Gras is nicely fried and crispy on the outside but the rissoto lacked the truffle smell and the pancetta is too fatty and oily. Quite a disappointment for me as I wanted to try since the last time I visited. The $5.50 top up for drink gave each of us a mushroom soup and drink each. The fizzy peach was good but the iced lemon tea was very different from the usual lemon tea. It tasted like Chinese tea with a slice of lemon added and my mum refused to drink it after a try. Perhaps they should replace with another brand of lemon tea!! The garlic bread we ordered to go with the mushroom soup is so so. Instead of customers paying for the garlic bread, a slice of it could be served with the soup. The service is still attentive compared to my first visit. We paid $60 plus for lunch and I think it's a little too expensive. Will still be back again on weekdays to try other dishes when it's less crowded and so more relaxin
5
I tried Ambush only last year and I have been going back since. They have good quality meals at reasonable prices. Portions are fair as well. The foie gras risotto at Ambush is my go-to! The restaurant can get crowded so remember to make a reservation via Chope. The Chope Shop also sells food vouchers at 10% off so you get an instant discount when you pay via vouchers.
4
Again, I will visit Ambush because of convenience and good food but unfortunately, the service is not up to expectation. Expecting service staff to be attentive & alert.
4
Been to ambush - bishan outlet quite a number of times. Food is still good especially the okbtoberfest platter and sausage plate.
5
Very surprised by the quality of the lunch set. Had sirloin steak which was very good. At S$15.90 for soup, main and coffee, it is definitely value for money
5
This is a place where you can gather and sit to talk for long. The servers allowed us to sit and continue our conversation despite we have finished eating. Thank you very much Ambush!
5
Great service, friendly and attentive team! Good variety of food too, the Salmon Fusilli pasta was delicious - a balance of sweetness, sourness and saltiness.
4
The food is good and using the Chope discount I would say it is value for money... went on a weekday evening and it is not too crowded
3
A very convenient stop for families and friends in the area. Average experience with the food, useful with the 10percent pre purchase voucher.
3
Order the salmon pasta, fried chicken pasta and truffles fries for sharing. pasta was good but the truffles fries was a disappointment! its was so hard , not crispy at all. seems like they have double fry the fries. its was hard yet not crispy. service was slow thou the restaurant wasnt really crowded.
4
We wanted a place to chit chat and also serves delicious food at a reasonable price. So I thought I will just give this place a try. We arrived about 10 minutes before the opening time but the waitress graciously allowed us to be seated inside while they got ready for business. She even served us with water on her own accord as she wasn't ready to take our order yet. Remember we were early The mixed seafood spaghetti was great and my fish and chips were great too! Even the coffee smells so good We chit chat from before 11am till 3pm and ordered further stuff like tea and truffle fries (yummy fries ). The service staff was very polite and efficient. We will visit again when another dear friend returns from overseas
4
The food was delicious and the service by the manager, impeccable.Maybe I was the only person who made a reservation but i was greeted by my name, which was a pleasant surprise.The manager was all smiles and helpful throughout our dinner. Keep it up
4
The environment was nice, restaurant was cosy and we felt relaxed. The choices of food was good and we had duck confit while my girl ate her favorite fish & chips.
3
Have been here before and you know what to expect. The pasta was ok. The mussels were a little disappointing. Medium to small mussels swimming in a broth which was tasty but lacked body. Onions were too crunchy, would be better if cooked longer.
4
Staff are usually quite attentive unless it's too crowded. There usually isn't a queue for good for times when you're too hungry to wait.Truffle fries not bad - generous with the truffle oil.My Husband likes the pork ribs. The serving generally isn't very big so it is a little pricey
3
Ambush touts itself as a casual European dining destination, and the place was approximately 50% full during my time there. Considering the total bill on a mid-October weekday lunch came to $15.20 for a complimentary soup of the day (cream of mushroom), to go with one choice of drink (I chose ice-lemon tea) and my choice of fish and fries: It is very decently priced, if you want fish and chips of a certain category and quality. If there was any truffle oil on the properly-cooked (but not overdone) fries, I did not detect it. The fish was sizeable and thinly battered, somewhat tasty, and considering the type of fish used (in a comparison of frozen fish used by various F & B competitors eg Fish and Co, Long John Silvers, Manhattan Fish Market, etc) and the quality of the mushroom soup when compared to other casual F & B places offering soup and also serving fish and chips, Ambush is significantly better. Unable to comment on the other dishes on Ambush's menu, because I did not try. Service was quick and civil, and extent of friendliness depends on who serves you. Nice place for a chat with a friend or friends if you like this sort of concept and the food, but not a place I'd recommend for a romantic outing. At full capacity, I am not sure how well the place would handle the noise but on a weekday, I'm guessing that the sound levels and occupancy rates of tables are still conducive to chats.If you crave fish and chips significantly better than the usual fish and chips in hawker centres and you happen to be in Bishan (and if you need to finish your meal within a certain timeframe), this experience is recommended

This review is related only to Ambush in Junction 8 and does not reflect on other outlets. SGD14.80 ++ plus SGD3.00 ++ for one sausage, scrambled eggs, one hashbrown, a slice of tomato, a small piece of foccacia bread, a few pieces of salad leaves and a coffee. Taste-wise nothing special. More like a McDonald's Big Breakfast with a slice of tomato and a few pieces of salad leaves. Therefore, not worth the price of SGD17.80 ++. A fair price will be SGD12 ++ because they provide proper tables and chairs to sit, a clean environment and proper service.Apart from the proper restaurant environment and the proper service, this Ambush Breakfast is poor in value. If you need to eat a western breakfast in Junction 8, I would recommend McDonald's. At the very least, you pay less for similar food. Enjoy
4
Tried their pastas, swissgerman sausage plater, steak and fries, also duck confit during lunch time. Their pasta and steak n fries never disappointed me. Worth of money since they come with soup of the day and drink (for lunch set menu only). And don't forget to order any menu that come with fries, since they fried their fries in truffle oil and make it taste very nice
4
The special of this month (July 2016) - lobster tail with seafood paste, where you get to choose the pasta and style of cooking - is worth the trip. The lobster tail is fresh and succulent, and the aglio olio linguine is well prepared and presented. The calamari skewer is a must have favorite of this place, and I can taste why.
4
Whilst service is so-so, I do enjoy the Oktoberfest plate. The pork knuckle is quite nice actually. So are the sausages. The escargot however is a tat salty. Garlic bread is a nice 2 slice of focaccia bread. Price is fairly reasonable. I would recommend this place for a casual no frills meal with friends or family
4
Variety choice of European food. Salad, pasta, pork nuckle and German sausage. Make sure you come early if you like to try the delicious pork nuckle. Fish & Chips is also very nice, well fried, crispy in the outside and tender fish inside. The restaurant is too small especially on meal time. You need to come early otherwise need to wait for the queue.
1
The restaurant outlook is great. Nice ambience and music. Ordered calamari, fish & truffle fries & ribeye steak (medium). Calamari was delicious ! Steak came, delicious wedges but meat tasted funny, had a piece and spit it out ! Meat was spoilt! Wanted the staff to taste it to make sure I wasn't wrong but manager said he don't eat beef. I am very sure the meat was spoilt! Fine.. Replaced it with another piece, this time it was overcooked. .. Well done... Very disappointed ! Didn't finished the steak cos not very good steak either. Fish wasn't that great but truffle fries were good.. Overall not good food .. Maybe wrong choice of order. Definitely not coming back!
5
They have lunch promotion currently. Serve normal western food. Borsch soup ok. Steak is nice but the waitress heard wrongly, order medium well become medium rare.
The others all are fine
4
We took dinner at Ambush before watching cinema. Service is very good and efficient. Clamps was perfect choice. Mix with ham. It was Delicious.
3
It might sound harsh to rate a European food outlet just on the strength of its burgers but it is at least a lowest common denominator.For $20++ you would expect a decent sort of burger, and this wasn't. One burger (not bad, thick but dry and overcooked), 2 slices of American style supermarket cheese, one soggy piece of lettuce and nothing much else.Service was dreadful but that may have just been my case -- they seated me behind a post where I couldn't be seen by any of the staff. Still, an occasional drift by my table to check that I was still alive wouldn't have taken much time from any of the waitstaff.Better food can be had elsewhere for much less money. Try Fat Boys
4
This is my second visit. My last was several years back. There are quite a number of items on the menu for selection. I had pasta which was tomato based. It was prepared reasonably well. Price was usual price for pasta. Staff were attentive and friendly. Restaurant was in a quiet corner so it was conducive for discussion
4
Honestly, I have never heard about this restaurant before until I tried it. And I was not disappointed. Great meal, fantastic service, a must try if you are around Bishan area. I was really surprised that there was no queue for this restaurant. With this kind of quality, you normally would expect a 30 mins of waiting time (or maybe I was just lucky back then). Will definitely come back for another dish, hopefully soon
5
My review is WELL overdue. It's my 4th visit here in the last 2 years and its better every time. SALMON with potato Rosti seems to be the favourite of most of my guests. Escargot was particularly scrumptious this time round. Reasonably priced for European Cuisine. Top marks for the TEAM who looked after us on 17th September 2015. Keep up the good work.

My wife and I decided to try this restaurant for the first time, It was 6pm on a Saturday evening and it was moderately full. The restaurant has a seating capacity of 80 people. The ambience is good and the tables are neatly placed apart.The menu is quite comprehensive with English, French, German and Italian dishes. Quite impressive.We ordered the soup of the day (mushroom soup), and for starters, Parmeson and Truffle Fries. For the main course, we ordered Spaghetti Al Frutti Di Mare and Pan Seared Salmon & French Lentils.The restaurant is called Ambush - Fast Casual European Dining. It does live up to its name because the food came really fast! The soup came almost immediately. And the main course came before the starter! Perhaps, this is something the restaurant could explain to their waiters, why starters are called starters.The spaghetti was a disappointment. The tomato sauce was sweet. I would have preferred the tanginess of real tomato sauce because it would have blended well with the seafood The salmon was ok although the sauce was bit on the salty side and the lentils were a bit hard. Then again we prefer our food with less salt.The fries were excellent and so was the soup.Overall, I would say the food is OK though a bit pricey. Would I go back again? Maybe. Need to try the lamb shank or pork knuckle
3
This is one of my favourite place if I want to try European food. They have various cuisine under one roof. It is better to come with a group so that you can try the various dishes and share out the costs. The meal may turned out a little pricey for 2 person.I will always order the mix pot of clamps and mussels in white wine sauce when I come here. The duck confit was a little dry this time. Luckily the meal was ended well with the Bailey's cream brulee
4
Been a fatabulous experience dining with this reataurant. The foods are good and price reasonable with fast serving food even peak hours.Must try its sausage as well as the pasta product range. Definitely will be visiting them again in near future in different location within singapore for another dining experience
4
The food here is good. Would't say the best but good fir the price. The pork knuckle is nicely done. Mini sausage platter was nice. The paella was average to ok. Service wasn't great but they were busy so its alright. Menu variety was fairly good. Drinks was big too. Overall was a good experience
