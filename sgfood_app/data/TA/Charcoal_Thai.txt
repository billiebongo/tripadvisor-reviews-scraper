Had an enjoyable meal here. Staff were friendly and ambience was cosy. Would definitely recommend to friends looking for an affordable mookata.

Went on a weekday afternoon. The staff were very attentive and helpful, was most impressed with their service. Food came fast and was very nice. Prawns were fresh, sweet, and good. Cheers.

I'm a student so it was very very cheap and super delicious!!
I would definitely come here again
7.95 per person is the best deal ever :)

Not really a fantastic place. With the amount they charge, you can spend it somewhere else. Purchase the dinner via Fave. The staff claim the voucher but didn't enter into the system. Was made to pay several add-ons such as weekend surcharge, crackers and drinks which not included. That's fine because it has been made aware. But the staff wanted to charge full price because of their mistake not enter the coupon into their system. Items you select will be provided with big portion and some of the items they don't have and you will not be inform as they will just put in something else of the same item you select for you

Was there last night, mediocre. 1> Quite slow in serving, suspect understaffed2> Food quality is under expectation. Meat is overly marinated, does not taste fresh. Ordered Kankong, apparently the vegetable was not washed before fried, there was still sands inside, hurting my teeth3> Price is not considered cheap with the food, service and environment quality4> Cracker $2 and not tasty, wet tissue $0.

Came here via Fave, food was okay but service was terrible. The cooked food we ordered took an hour to arrive, and the crew seemed clueless about our order. It wasn't rush hour period so I don't see how the service couldn't be a little more attentive.

Beware that plain drinking water is charged per cup at $1 plus service and plus GST ($1.17) We ordered 3 warm water and subsequently asked for 2 glass of ice water. Was billed $5++ for 5 cups of water! Pls. Note prawn crackers appetizers and wet towels are all chargeable. We ate the mookata buffet but service was very slow and staff presence though cordial but very very sparse. Quality & taste of marinated meats was unpleasant e.g black pepper strangely marinated with Indian curry spices. Prawns were fresh, squid rings were frozen type n tasteless.

We bought Groupon and have collagen steamboat yesterday.First time trying out collagen soup base and it taste not bad. The meat are well marinated as well, but just portion of dishes is quite small hence we TOP up additional 4 more steamboat items. For drinks, there's additional expenses, even water (refillable) at $1 per cup. But worth it, as it's very cold (lots of ice)Would recommend to try

*Food variety is similar to other hotpot restaurants. *It's buffet but you have to request for the food that you want so technically it's not a buffet style. But this style is better than the buffet to avoid waste of food. *Service is excellent as the staff are friendly and will always visit your table*It's good for big group of family and friends.
