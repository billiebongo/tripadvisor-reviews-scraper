We went for dinner and most of their dishes were not available (We changed 2 out of 3 dishes) due to the non availability of vegetable and pork ribs. In terms of taste, it was overall acceptable and the price was reasonable.

The new management has done well. They have shortened the menu and focused on their signature dishes. Good strategy. The service was prompt. The food were consistently good. And the place was packed. A testimony that they have got their strategy right

Good range of items in the menu and highly attentive wait staff. Love it that drinking water is free.

I was there specially for their well known Fish Head Curry but ended up disappointed. The curry was delicious but the fish head wasnâ€™t fresh. Seriously hope this can be improved.

Ordered 1 larger size curry fish head. Curry was aromatic and fish was sufficient for 5 adults. However one thing to note is that due to large size of fish, and small size of pot, curry for insufficient for 5 adults. Might want to order 2 small fish head so that the curry is sufficient.

Ordered Curry fish head, prawn paste chicken wings, sambal Kang Kong, Homemade toufu and Banana fritters with ice cream.All dishes were excellent, curry fish head was very good, curry has nice aroma and taste to it and just the right consistency. Only let down was the Banana fritter with Ice cream was nothing to shout about. Maybe will try their mango sticky rice next time. Overall, this is a restaurant i would recommend to friends and family. Will certainty retur

Service was terrible. When I stepped in and mentioned that I have a reservation with Chope and the service staff just gave me a blank look. While ordering, we enquired about certain dishes and was told flatly no idea as she has not tried before. One dish also did not reach the table till after we already finished our food and reminded them about it. Food was also average

We were keen to try hooked on heads due to several food critics' good reviews. However, the fish head curry that was raved about, was super disappointing. The curry is quite powdery. Nonya vegetable was also rather tasteless and cabbage was still relatively hard. Hmm as for yang Zhou fried rice.. Just normal

I've been to the restaurant on several occasions. And it never fails to impress me all the time. This time it surprised me with a renovated decor. It was bright and cosy. We had sambal la la, fish maw soup, prawn paste chicken, oyster omelette, and hei zhor. All so yummalicious. Service was efficient too. Fantastic

Cozy place, albeit a little but hard to locate. Great find nevertheless. Would definitely come back again for the food

Recently changed of owner but unsure of the chef. Improved with wider selection of menu but the price went up for one of my favourite Mee Goreng. And the taste not as good as before.

It was our first time and a completely horrible experience! We had to wait nearly an hour for our food which came out in dribs and drabs with long waiting times in between.Signature fish curry: the fish was stale and the curry gravy failed to mask the stench of the stale fishFish maw soup: it was watery and tastelessPrawn paste chicken: not well-marinated and not properly deep fried. Chicken flesh was tasteless beneath the fried skinDeep fried baby squid in sweet sauce: this lost its crispiness minutes after being served and became rubbery and chewyThe staff are friendly, polite and hardworking but amazingly inefficient and unproductive. 1st they came with 3 sets of cutlery for 4 of us. After repeated reminders the 4th set was producedAfter endless waiting for the food which still had not come, we requested for water and the waitress brought only 3 glasses despite visually checking our table for number of pax!This will be our 1st and last time to this restauran

We were a group of 14 pax and they acceded to our request for a big table. 14 is probably the max one can seat at the biggest table. We ordered one whole fish head ($45), beef rending, chap chye, basil chicken, deep fried tofu and baby squid + 11 drinks. The total bill came to about $16/head.Fish head was tasty and not too spicy. Included inside was ladies fingers and brinjal. However, there wasn't enough meat to go round, so maybe next time we will order the fish fillet next time.The baby squid was excellent with the right amount of sweetness and crunchiness.Basil chicken was a nice change from the usual Har Cheong Kai served at most zi char joints. a generous amount of onions was included.The deep fried tofu was so so only. Chap chye had more tofu and some black fungus than vegetables. Would have preferred more vegetables as this was our only vegetable dish.Overall a satisfying meal in an airconditioned place. Lots of parking available so this is a good place for family dinners

Went on a Friday night and it was surprisingly quiet. We were quickly ushered to a table and our orders were taken and promptly delivered (: the food was really good, the curry fish head did not disappoint. Loaded with veggies and the spice was perfect, only qualm would be that the fish head (half) may be considered small for 3 hungry people. Other than that, all the dishes we tried (sambal kang kong, chap chye and seafood) were extremely tasty and well-cooked as well. It was a very pleasant meal and i have no complaints, will definitely be back! Furthermore, when using the Chope app and ordering a fish head curry, you can get one veggie free! The total bill came up to about $60 for 3 people for 4 dishes, which is very very reasonable and worth it given the quality and portion sizes.

We had just been to this restaurant after a walk from the Macritchie reservoir near by. We read the review about the curry fish head. So of course that is must try dish. It turned out not bad. Half fish head $25, whole fish head $45. We total 3 family 12 pax, ordered one whole fish head and black pepper beef, sweet sour prawn, home made crispy tofu, Praw paste chicken wing, baby kalan, Fu rong egg. The normal dish share is not very big, chicken wing, Tofu, prawn are all only 8 pieces per dish. We requested extra half share for those dishes. Total bill including 14 rices, costed $185. So the price is within normal restaurant range. The restaurant is not very big, but luckily still have two big tables which can cater up to 12 pax. The environment is also quite ok. Suitable for family gathering. Worth to try

...I head straight here for the best local food! I usually bring my friends with me, but this time I couldn't wait. As soon as I got off the plane, I headed straight here with my starving empty belly. Within minutes of ordering, my ginger fish and tofu vegetables dish arrived along with a glass of delicious lime juice. YUMMMM The Fish Head Curry is their specialty - I saw one on every other table in the restaurant that night! Come here for a warm and cosy family night out that won't break the budget

There isn't any much good Chinese cooked curry fish head around these days. Some too much curry powder, some too spicy, some too much Indian spices... This restaurant sells just the right one for me but it is a kind of pricey. Aircon environment, family style dining, cozy nice place. The only thing is that the service is a slow, took them 5mins to notice me. Took them another few more to come to the table and take orders! I have to get my own table instead of get seated as the guy at the counter is just more interested with his smart phone. But when I went to the cashier, the guy is so fast to come and collect money... Hmmmm... Tells a lot about their attitude
