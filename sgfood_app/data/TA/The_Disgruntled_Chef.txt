Unlike some of the reviews I’ve read, was deadly quiet one lunchtime so atmosphere at other times will be better I’m sure, but the food was very nice, all in an enjoyable experience.
5
Brought my girlfriends to try and they loved it. Constant raves about the food and ambience. Keep up the good work!
5
This is our second time here and the food and service are just as sterling as the first visit. If you are looking for a small cosy restaurant with great food, this is it!
4
Great ambience. Like the greenery just outside the restaurant. Dining in the comfort of air con surrounded by greenery.
4
Great establishment situated in Dempsey hill. Nice ambiance and surroundings. Food was fresh and delicious
5
The restaurant has an intimate and cozy setting. The staffs are very hospitable, which makes our dining experience very enjoyable. We had the epicurean 5 course set and the food are awesome! We will definitely be back again, with our friends and family!

Went to Disgruntled Chef years ago and had a positive experience. Went back last Friday and was sorely disappointed. The food quality was mediocre. The service was prompt (probably because the restaurant was half empty). We complained that the bone marrow serving was too small for the price we were paying and they only managed a "sorry but this batch of bones are small". Will not go back there
1
One of the least-worthy-of-the-price set menu I’ve taken. At $68 per pax, a 5-course set dinner sounds alright at first. But when the dishes are served. It was almost all tiny sizes of servings. The smallest ribeye I’ve seen and a 3 small mouthful of panna cotta for dessert. The 3 starters are sharing dishes of which one starter is finished eaten in one teaspoon. The dishes are nothing special and presented in the least interesting way. At the end of the dinner I headed to a nearby stall for roti-prata to satisfy my appetite
2
Disgruntled staff! Disgruntled manager and disgruntled service!!!Good food but not worth a visit...Their service is absolutely terrible with their staff with the worst attitude! We ordered the suckling pig at 8.15 and it turned up at 1.25. Upon asking for our food, the answers we got were, it's on the way - from where, no idea!!! I would never go again
3
Sorry many restaurants to choose from and although this venue is ok, it definitely could be better.Service very attentive and friendly Food was delivered in good time Presentation and quality was ok - I had the sword fish and it was cooked well - sides were a mixed bag and not very tasty Toilets outside and downstairs
4
Truffle Mac & Cheese, Scallops & Sticky Pudding was nice! Swordfish steak was ordinary.
Servings were rather small regardless small/big plates. A little pricey!
5
Great ambience , lovely food and staff
Plates are a bit small but for ladies brunch it is just nice
Highly recommend
1
Painfully long wait for our orders, over 30 minutes for dessert, no follow through, and they didn't even handle the bill properly. Bunch of amateurs, frankly. Nice setting, but no professionalism in service.
4
We have the 600g wagyu beef for two which comes with two sides. We have the gratin and the mushrooms which are delicious. I would give it a 5 star if not for the overly quiet restaurant. Good for couples who want some alone time.
5
A wonderful setting for dinner. It's a great space to get away from the city. Must order the suckling pig and the marrow. They were just fantastic. Service from the staff is also great. We are looking forward to being back.
2
The night started well with attentive service, good chill music and tasty lamb. Then it got progressively worse... The already small menu had items unavailable for the night, both food and drink items. What's worst, the music evolved into something of an 1130pm club play list. Very strange indeed.The bit that made this even worst was despite a note to Reservations that this was a birthday, there was no acknowledgement throughout dinner from the service team. A disappointment because I had my birthday dinner thrown here some years back and I recalled some personalization by the serve team.It's a pity. This was my friends first visit and they said they wouldnt be returning
4
Went with 6 people. The outdoor is surrounded with greenery very tranquil n nice. Indoor a tad too dark guess they want to set it in a romantic mood. Food can be better. We ordered a few appetizers. Truffle cheese was nice , seared scallops needed a little more seasoning , lamb ribs was marinated with Indian herbs tasted great. Main course I had the duck confit. Again needed a little seasoning but it was crispy on the outside. Beef was ok n suckling pig skin wasn't crispy could be better. Overall food was ok no wow factor for sure but service staff were excellent especially Nas who took care of us.
2
We used to love going to this quirky, unique restaurant but oh my, how the standards have fallen! While much of The Disgruntled Chef's (TDC) menu remains in tact post-takeover by Harry's Group (ugh!) the quality has fallen somewhat and the service was utterly appalling. Our dinner tonight started out reasonably but service declined progressively throughout the night (in only 30% occupancy!) because our waitress (Lynn) found some people she knew at a table and persisted in chatting with them throughout most of our meal. It got so bad that I had to get up to take cutlery from another table so we could eat dessert (as we weren't served fork and spoon). Empty wine glasses were repeatedly ignored and the maitre d'hote filled in where Lynn lacked. All in all, a disaster of an evening because the service side of the house made the chef's hard work tediously difficult to enjoy, Zero tipping and zero returning. How sad for such a great (previously) eatery. The beef tartare, bone marrow and tuna tacos were a definite highlight (thanks chef - too bad your waiting staff don't care about you). :-
3
Went there for their lunch set.The service was great, very personalised service and friendly waiter. They even decorated our dessert with happy birthday wordings, because I input "for a birthday celebration" while making the reservation through chope.However the food was rather disappointing, not a place I will return to. The appetiser was just average. I personally do not like the taste of beetroot, thus I did not like that dish. The salmon tacos was a tad too salty because they used smoked salmon, but the charcoal bread crumbs was thumbs up. For the mains, the sea bass we ordered was slightly overcooked, and the sauce was only okay because it doesn't really add value or bring out the taste of the sea bass. The iberico pork was slightly better, and matched well with the smokey brown sauce. Dessert was great, sticky toffee pudding (additional order) and the chocolate dessert within the set menu. One of the best sticky toffee pudding I have tried. The place was quite stuffy, and the air con was not that cooling. Probably something they can improve on.Overall, there were some hits and misses. I had better fine dining lunch sets in terms of the taste of the food and also the environment
4
Had the set lunch on a weekday and it was quiet that day with only a handful of diners that day. The food was stylishly presented, especially the salmon tacos which were on a bed of breaded charcoal! Liked the quinoa which came the seabass. Dessert of chocolate semifreddo was rich and heavy; got a bit too sweet towards the end. Overall a good deal for lunch and nice place for catching up with friends
4
With interesting and creative dishes that you want to try them all. Portions are generous for individuals but also good to share.
5
Lovely little restaurant with superb food and great service. Another gem at Dempsey!
I recommend the suckling pig.
4
Brought the family to try their set lunch.
They loved the dishes and want to go again.
Egg starter was very tasty.
Pork, fish and chicken mains very good as well.
3
Food quality is not bad. Atmospherics also very nice. But the portion for the set lunch can be larger.
4
The starter knocked our socks off! A delicious concoction of egg and truffle. We both loved it. Our mains were pork and sea bass, also both delicious. We shared a sticky pudding for dessert, only because we decided to be good and not to have a whole one each, then we wished we had! Really delicious food, in a quiet enclave in Dempsey Hill. We went for lunch and it was very quiet, but it's an out of the way spot and we imagine it's far busier at night

We had chosen this restaurant based on the excellent experience we had at its sister restaurant 'The Disgruntled Brasserie'. Unfortunately this experience was quite different. Firstly we were disappointed when presented with the menu to find they didn't have the majority of drinks available. Seriously! All of the red wines were off the menu and all bar one of the whites. There was a short list of alternative wines on the table. However, having picked the restaurant based on the menu online (the same as the one we were presented) this was disappointing. The second issue was the service. Not all of the waiters, but several appeared to be inexperienced and when questioned clearly did not know or understand the menu.On a positive note all of the food was great and arrived in a timely manner. If I was being hypercritical my scallop starter was underseasoned and as a result slightly bland. The rest of the meal was faultless though.In summary the food was great but let down by inexperienced waiting staff and poor selection of beverages. I feel sorry for the chefs as they are being let down by the front of house. This place isn't cheap either which coupled with the other issues left us feeling underwhelmed, especially when the sibling on Ann Siang Rd is exceptional
4
My friend and I tried a variety of small plates and across the board, the standard was high. Ingredients were good quality and combinations worked well. The staff were excellent - we hardly even noticed when they refilled our water glasses etc but everything was done efficiently and effortlessly. The setting is nice and it has a private but casual feel that works. I will definitely go back to try some of the 'big plates' and the desserts looked nice too.
5
The starters where exceptional, the crispy smelt fish, baked bone marrow and all the others are spot on. Its a true treat. Maybe you dont have many choices, but the ones you have you will definitely not forget and crave for more. The surprising thing is that the main courses and deserts were as good so this is a restaurant to return many times. The service was very good allowing us to taste all the selection of wines they had by the glass and picking the one we preferred. The suggestions where spot on. Its a cosy family kind of restaurant where you treat all your senses
4
My first time at the restaurant with a friend on Good Friday. They had a special brunch menu. The waiter recommended we shared one set and order extra dishes. It was a great a idea. The brunch was a 6 course meal and the extras we had mac & cheese and the crispy lamb. The food were simply delicious and creative. Service was attentive despite being busy. We had a great time
5
The starter portion sizes seemed on the small side but turned our just right as the mains were hearty and filling. Server was polite and attentive too. Sadly thought some of the cocktails I'd explicitly meant to try were no longer available and the website hadn't accurately reflected that. All in all though, it was a lovely experience. I'd highly recommend the restaurant and I would also come back.
5
Fantastic choice of very different meals as far as flavours and portion sizes. Ideal to have as share plates amongst a small group and really enjoy a variety of great tastes
4
Overall great place to hv gathering. Could provide bread. Disappointed that some drinks were not a available on Saturday night
5
Do check this place out if you are looking somewhere which offers good food and service! Atmosphere is great too with comfortable lighting and music. Highly recommend the truffle macaroni with cheese which comes in a delicious truffle cheese sauce and fresh crayfish meat.
2
Very tasty food, but noisy group that the restaurant couldn't do anything about ! Disappointed. Not recommended.
5
Had a great business dinner at the Disgruntled Chef on Valentine's Day, with a number of out of town colleagues. Unfortunately many restaurants in Singapore only offer a special menu for this dinner. The service was great , food was spectacular. Our business meeting was a tad odd in the sea of couples dinning in the restaurant ..... I would recommend this restaurant anytime Reservations likely a good idea , although every time I visited they seemed to have available tables. Service was constantly great Enjoy
3
Overall we were very underwhelmed by our meal. To start....15-20 mins for our glass of champagne and tiny G&T to arrive after three follow ups. Minimum staff as CNY so service was poor, staff nice and not their fault - why open if they can't produce enough staff. Food was fine at the very best overall - scallops hugely under seasoned, good ceviche to be fair but the beef cheeks and Yorkshire pudding was Underwheling; my recipe is superior. When a top end restaurant has a wine list on a grubby piece of paper On a clip board it doesn't create a good impression. For a 330 SGD meal it was disappointing...real shame as was expecting great things..
4
Enjoyed a work dinner here last night. It is pretty tucked away in Dempsey. The ambience is not as good as the food - plain tables and decor.Food makes up for it. Limited menu but we tried a few of the small plates and particularly enjoyed the short Beef ribs, steak tartare and the fried Camembert. For main we enjoyed the suckling pig.The wine list is quite limited but the pricing is reasonable - for Singapore
5
Excellent place to end the week. Ambience of the place was good. Food was good but the only downside is getting to Dempsey. Recommended to drive or take a cab there. Service was excellent and food servings were just nice and paced according to our consumption speed. Will be back again.
4
We came here for Sunday brunch and didn't know all they served was the brunch menu. It would have been nice to have the ala carte options made available as well. Prices were reasonable food was good (except they undercooked the fish and gave me a new one). The baby spinach salad and foie gras burger was really tasty, as was the chocolate lava cake. I will probably come back to try their dinner menu
2
Food is still good but the service staff have changed and are now well short of the standard they should be.
4
No wonder why this restaurant was one of the best must go to restaurant in Dempsey Hill! I had pan roasted tenderloin and it was cooked to perfection! I would definitely back this October!
4
Been to Disgruntled Chef a few times and it's been consistently good food. The service staff are helpful and friendly. The Setting is -also nice and intimate so it's really a great place for an enjoyable night out
5
Food was great. Service impeccable. One of the better sangria. Only grouse was that crackling pork portion was not really value for money
Nonethelesd, definitely will visit again.
4
Food was generally tasty and good. Don't order the pork bun tho. The bun was dried out and hard and the filling is just a few slivers of fatty meat with kim chi. However would recommend the truffled macaroni and cheese
2
My client found a piece of plastic wrapping inside the burger halfway eating it. We didn't want a replacement because my client was quite put off by it, but was nice about it. We were only offered 2 cups of coffee on the house. The food was not great either. The brunch at Club Street was much better
5
I love this place and I will go back. It's one of the few places where they don't turn the temperature so low that it's no long enjoyable, so that's a big plus. The wine we had a Viognier from New Zealand I believe was great. The tapas, like octopus croquette or air baguette are dishes you just have to try they're simply divine. Some were indeed absolutely stunning. We will surely go back
4
I'm not a big fan of Dempsey Hill. But I do very like the Disgruntled Chef. I was catching up with an long lost former colleague for early mid week lunch and were confronted with a brunch menu. Mac and cheese with prawns and crayfish to start. Then Wagyu steak and eggs. It was delicious!
4
We started with a beer and tried the appetizer list up & down. All dishes served not only looked, but also tasted very good. We then commenced with different main courses and shared the same. Similar as with the appetizers, the dishes served not only looked very good they all tasted very good. We also tried 4 different bottles of red wine. Each one was worth the amount we paid. All in all, we spend a nice evening there, good value for mone
4
Disgruntled Chef has a following and I like the food there. Unfortunately I was disappointed when I went to their new branch at Ang Siang. I wanted so much to like it that I went twice in a month. But despite how beautiful the angsiang branch is, it was empty both times I went. As such, the dempsey branch is preferred by me simple because it has more customers! I hate eating in empty restaurants! I like the small plates there and love sharing everything
4
Service at the restaurant was a rare gem among Singaporean restaurants. Service staff makes eye contact and acknowledges your presence when necessary. In addition, orders were efficiently taken and iced water was refilled very quickly on request. Food was also quickly served after orders were taken, given that the restaurant was quite full on the day of visit.The food was generally tasty and flavors blend well together on each dish. My favourite dish of the day was the beetroot salad. It was a light dish and the natural sweetness of the beetroot was able to shine. The macaroni and cheese, however, was less than inspiring as it was rather heavy on the palette.Lastly, not sure if the atmosphere I encountered was the norm at the restaurant but there was a huge group of diners at the restaurant on the day of visit who was celebrating a birthday so the restaurant was rather rowdy. Its actually a very nice environment if it is quiete
4
Went for brunch, which starts at 12pm.. Brunch menu was more "lunch" than "brunch". Good that the food was tasty enough to ease the initial disappointment, esp duck confit. Nice atmosphere!
4
The Disgruntled Chef is a hidden gem in the Dempsey Hill area. The food is innovative and well done. The small plate concept is a good way to sample several dishes, all of which are well prepared. Kudos to the chef.
4
Service was good and food was delicious! Just be aware that not all the small plates are really that small. truffle mac and cheese and the scallop small plate was awesome!
4
Sharing plates are small in size but big in flavour. You'll want to order a couple of the dishes if there's a few of you as the portions are small. Scallops, beetroot, mac & cheese and ceviche small plates were outstanding.
5
Deceptively casual in appearance, every detail here is top notch, from the decor to the ambiance to the service to (of course) the food!
Put yourself in the hands of the talented staff and chefs and enjoy this Dempsey gem.
2
while the food was good the service time had been rather poor. a family of 5 coming for a lunch meal. 1 starter was served to one person in our group, the next person to be served was 20min later. while one of our group was just having their starter another was being served their mains. none of the meals came out in a good order until dessert but even then one of group had been forgotten about and was almost not served a dessert.besides these service let downs the food was nice tasting and well presented. another tip if you order the sangria ask for less ice otherwise 3/4 of the jug will be ice
5
Hidden up on Dempsey Road this is a gem. The food is exceptional and service very good. Best to have share plates the Suckling Pig was exceptional as was the Wagyu beef and the Scallops and basically the whole menu.Will definitely come back and recommend to lovers of great food
3
We arrived at 1155 before the restaurant opened, and Simon (the floor manager, I beleive) invited us to wait inside at a corner table with a view of the surrounding garden. During the entire meal, he popped by each table to check on their meals and experiences, and was always ready to provide suggestions as to courses.The restaurant has changed the brunxh menu for July and I was slightly dissappointed as I had been looking forward to having the Irish hash with eggs. In the end, we started with their ever-popular Mac and Cheese, which had lovely bits of crayfish and was nicely grilled on top. The truffle taste was also predominant. Overall, this starter was nice and has to be shared, or it could tend to be 'heavy'. We also had the charcoal waffle with foie gras butter and duck confit. The duck was very good, being crispy on the outside and yet moist inside. We also loved the foie gras butter, but the charcoal waffle was hard and simply tasted of burnt toast. We also ordered the wagyu beef, and the accompanying handcut fries were done weill. The wagyu ($4 supplement) beef patty with foie gras was juicy, though it tasted a tad sweet, probably from the onion relish. I would have loved a slice of pickled cucumber and a tomato, but that is just a personal preference.Dessert was Roquefort cheese 'Magnum' ice cream, which was well presented atop a plate of chilled pebbles, which changed colors from grey to black as they heated up. The ice cream itself was slightly bitter, perhaps from the chocolate coating, but the cheese had an odd aftertaste. My wife did not like it and gave up after a couple of.bites. I guess this is an acquired taste - perhaps a slice of strawberry could help. Overall, it was a nice concept
4
Let me start with a generalist overview. I'm not a fan of the Singapore restaurant sceneHence my delight at discovering this Singapore institution, The Disgruntled Chef. This restaurant goer is Disgruntled no longer.The menu was interesting and well thought out. I could have eaten everything listed and did my best to work my way through It. The dining room, service, wine list bill all fell into line on point.I will be returning to continue eating through the menu.Grams meal out with friends.
5
Thanks for the birthday message and lighted candle for my wife that accompanied the delicious and warm Chocolate Fondant. About S$90 lunch for two "brunch" set but the food is no small portion with each person having 2 plate choices. Mac & Cheese was simply a pleasure with crayfish and truffle. Staff are very friendly and attentive. The restaurant manager called personally beforehand to clarify on our booking. Nice ambience at this cozy dim place with natural lights coming in from the windows above
5
Excellent experience. Good service and knowledgeable staff. Food was delicious. Would definitely return again.
5
Recommend miso cod and appepetites all are nice. Desserts are quite impressive. Service is a bit of slow and limited choice.
4
The food was great as usual and a good selection of wines to choose from. Excellent place to spend a Friday evening.
3
Great service provided with decent brunch especially truffle Mac and cheese and mentaiko pasta. Menu is limited though. Steak and egg - steak is quite decently prepared however is a sirloin cut that cost $38 - slightly on the expensive side. However overall good experience.
4
Very good (slightly pricey) burger, good brunch items - macaroni was excellent and tartines were good too.
5
Quaint and relaxing location. Service was great and food was good as well. An enjoyable experience overall.
4
Have been coming to DC since it opened many years ago, and always love it! Last nights was s bit different though, as I opened the menu I couldn't find my Favourite bone marrow, and realised mentaiko pasta is only at brunch. Still managed to have the always awesome mac & cheese, but was let down by the crispy prawns. Ultimately the winning formula of great ambience and some of the best cocktails in town prevailed tho. Will be back for more!!
5
I loved this restaurant. I went for a lunch with my friend and I was really delighted that I visited this place.The food was just simply amazing and service was too good as well. I love their menu and also good selection of cocktails as well.Best restaurant ever
3
not enthusiastic about dinner.menu is written in small letter and the pseudo cozy ambiance is definitively too dark for my middle aged eyes. good that the cell phone has a torch.then cuisine is a bordering on too strongly spiced western food. beef tartare with wasabi egg yolk or mayo; truffle mac&cheese with a strange mix of seafood and truffle... then main lamb fried with spice or average steak, or scallop with dry-fried pork belly... nothing spectacular.overall, a try and not necessarily a place to come back to.service is young and eager, but not experienced
3
We opted for the World Gourmet Summit menu with wine pairing. The food was OK but was verging on luke warm by the time it reach our table. The staff were junior and were not knowledgeable about the servings. The waiter recited his script at the start ( barely audible) but clearly wasn't able to field questions. The food was good so this wasn't a huge issue.However I was much more disappointed by the miserly wine servings. I believe the inexperienced serving staff had something to do with this. Further they were unable to enter into a conversation. Typically one would expect a somellier for a discussion and typically much more generous servings
4
We were waited by a friendly and attentive staff. He recommended dishes since it was our first visit.
The food taste good. Price is above average.
The lighting is dark to us. Need to us a mini torchlight to see menu.
Thanks
3
Pumpkin starter was mushy. Hanger steak was tad dry & overdone. Dessert was the only good item on set lunch menu.
5
I felt so loved the moment I walked into the restaurant as the waiter came to greet me and helped me carry my bags... the staff was very attentive and I was so thrilled and happy with the food! It was not a disappoinment at all
2
We had a large group at the Ann Siang location recently. In the week leading up to the lunch we were told they were ok with a la carte as a food option. The day before we arrived they called and said "we only do set lunches at $44".. after a fairly heated conversation they agreed to continue w a la carte. On the day we turned up and asked (on seeing the food prices) if they still did set menus and we were then told no they never do them on saturdays. Obviously all very confused we continued to order as per the plan.. there are only 6-8 options for main course, one of which we were only told was not available after we'd been siting there choosing what do eat for 30mins and in the middle of placing our orders. This then pushed out the ordering process. After ordering and waiting ten mins someone then came out and notified us that the meals would be delayed due to the fact we ordered mains (again this couldve been done at the start as it may have effected what people chose to order).. we waited another 30mins and then asked for some FOC starters which they agreed to (this was good). because the whole lunch was pushed out we were then given desert menus in the middle of eating our mains and told the kitchen was closing in ten mins so this was our only chance to order. Did not order deserts due to the rush but were still pushed out the door at 3.30 because they needed to get read for the 'dinner crowd'.. I was annoyed by this as the delay had not been our fault, the dinner crown was surely at least 4 hours away and this again could have been communicated to us when we arrived
3
Went for date night with my wife and having had a great V Day experience at their other outlet in Ann Siang, was expecting good things.Steak Tartare - good, but I've had betterEscargot - interesting take on a bed of spinach and wine reduction. I like the traditional garlic baked kind still though.CÃ´te de Boeuf - main dish was the most disappointing of the lot. Meat was tough and came out closer to medium/medium well rather than the medium rare we ordered. The texture was almost as if they broiled the beef which i suspect wasn't of the highest quality in the first place. This was the deal breaker for me. Waste of money and honestly, spoilt the evening which started out with high expectations they failed to meet. Shame. When feedback was given, the response was almost nothing more than a shrug of the shoulders. "I'll let the chef know and check what's wrong
4
Visited on a Saturday lunchtime when the menu is a little confusing in that the Monday to Friday dishes aren't available from the specials but there aren't others to replace. Also the menu itself was nearly impossible to read, even wtih reading glasses, as the feint font and dimmed lights made it very difficult. Come on guys, you need to help your customers here and make the menu easy to read, for goodness sake!So we were two locals and two visitors, and chose a mix of dishes to share, which worked well. Bacon asparagus (though probably not the best dish to share), mentaiko pasta, lamb short rib (delicious), seared scallop, haricots verts and we shared shared a carafe of thai white sangria (60) of all things. Food good and nicely served. Staff very helpful. Together with four coffees, bill was just over $200 plus service and tax of course. You'd need a car to get here, though..
4
The place was relatively quiet and good for a weekday lunch away from work. The tuna tartare on avocado that I ordered for starter was very good. It would be better if some crusty bread was served with it. It was followed by grilled sea bass on a bed of beetroot quinoa. The sea bass was very fresh and the quinoa went well with it. My friend and I shared a toffee pudding with vanilla ice cream. It was a delicious and sweet ending to our meal. The service was excellent. We were served promptly and the staff was pleasant. The environment was clean and place was tastefully decorated. I would definitely come back for lunch especially for some special occasion
5
We enjoyed a delicious Saturday night dinner here, sat on the outside terrace. The menu is diverse and we enjoyed sharing a mix of small plates as starters (the chicken liver pate was a favourite), and then having our own large plate as a main (i love the scallops with pork belly). And we finished with the sticky toffee pudding which was divine. The food was delicious, flavours combinations were interesting, portion sizes were fairly generous, and the atmosphere was lovely. Service was fine, though they did miss off one of our sides, and there was a mistake with the bill initially (though this was quickly fixed)
5
Went for lunch and had a 3 course set meal, every course was perfectly cooked and very reasonably priced at $33pp, i would definately go back to this restaurant next time i visit Singapore, the staff could not do enough for you and the atmosphere in the restaurant was wonderful
3
Valentines dinner - chef is clearly skilled given mains were excellent, unfortunately only one small serve of entree and dessert for 2 persons to share. Doesn't seem to make good sense given we ordered a set meal each. Would have been better if they increased the portion or gave us one each.For over 200 dollars for the meal, didn't walk away satisfied and full. Adjourned for a second dinner after the visit
2
Nice friendly staff, but food was seriously average. No seasoning and pretty flavourless. All frills no knickers.
5
The menu, ingredients, and presentation are all great here - so many tempting selections. A really nice space away from the hustle and bustle of Chinatown.
5
Never been disappointed. Always happy to return with family and friends. Look forward to next visit.
4
An excellent place for fine dining. Great food, impeccable service & commendable ambience. Recommended!
4
Had Christmas dinner there. It was a really pleasant surprise. The atmosphere is very nice, staff is extremely nice and food is delicious. I will definitely come back.
5
Food is always tasty! Although my favorite dish is no longer served , the chef never let me down . Always kept coming back !
5
I have been coming to DC weekly since November. All i can say is excellent service and great food. I am addicted to their Tropical Sangria and have tried most of the dishes on the menu. Fantastic food! Keep it up!
4
fortunately, they serve great food and give excellent service.
one thing though... i arrived as a disgruntled guest as i couldn't find the place!
5
The location took a little effort to find but it was eventually worth it. Being slightly secluded from the other eateries was good. We were greeted with very friendly servers and was provided recommendations when asked.The menu selection looks unique and we were not disappointed with any of the dishes we had. That is so rare these days.The Baby Spinach Salad was amazing. Never thought I would be excited over a salad dish but yes, I really enjoyed it. We also had the Crispy Pig Ears because we were quite intrigued how it would turn out to be in such an establishment. It was very nicely done. Very crispy and tender but not oily. Fantastic dish.We ordered the Chicken and Duck Liver Parfait and it was taste so good. My only complain is that there wasn't enough brioche to go along with it but it was good.For the mains, we shared an Oven Baked Miso Cod. It was complimented with some clam and seaweed rice that looks a bit like risotto. The cod simply melts but yet retained the heat and moisture, which goes very well with the rice. Highly recommended for all cod lovers out there.How could we not have dessert after getting blown away by the starters and mains. So we ordered a Sticky Toffee Pudding. And we got blown even further. Oh my heavenly goodness, it was soooooo good. I had my long black and it goes so well with it.We will definitely return to try the rest of the dishes.
5
Tugged in a cosy corner in the greenery of Dempsey, it offers a great ambience for me and my girlfriend to celebrate our special day, coupled with nice tasty food and great service from the staffs.We had the Beef Tenderloin which was cooked to perfection and the Miso Cod which was sweet, fresh and tasty. The restaurant was also nice enough to accede to my special request and offered us a complimentary cake wishing me and my girlfriend for our anniversary
5
We really enjoyed the food!
Just one comment on scallops: hope scallops is not as salty and crackling will have more crackle in the future.
5
The dishes we had were fresh and well cooked. Very tasty too. The waiter who was serving us was very attentive and knowledgeable
1
Avoid this if you have tastebuds. Food is as disgruntled as the chef. The most flavorless food (if at all you could call it that) I've ever had in my life.

Generally very tasty mains and desserts. But portions could be a bit bigger.
Would recommend this place to friends.

if nothing else you must ave the awesome truffles mac & Cheese and the chocolate fondant with peanut butter !

Restaurant and service were a pleasant surprise - tastefully decorated room with fresh flowers, are always welcome.Food was bit disappointing though, expected more refinement. We had the blooming onion starter, which looks great, but half of it is inedible, unless you like to eat slightly heated raw onion. Duck confit was tender, but dish is not well balanced with 1 small potato and some lackluster overcooked and under-seasoned cabbage with runny sauce - it was very disappointing overall including sloppy presentation.Next table's choice looked much better, perhaps we try that next time.This review is aimed as a message of constructive feedback to restaurant, would like to see the next level The Disgruntled Chef can get to.

I was there to entertain 3 guests. I was amazed at the Pumpkin Salad that was served to me. The rocket salad served to me had turned yellow, ie. the vegetables were not fresh anymore. The Hanger Steak was suppose to be medium but the ends were all well done.

Great restaurant . Wonderful evening , with attentive service. The food was very good, simple but very good. I particularly liked the snails which were delicious. We liked the formula which was to share small dishes and a main course / tapas style. The decor was really nice, nested in a place which looks like a jungle. The only thing which I did not like was to find a Mouton Cadet on the wine list by the glass. Mouton Cadet is synonymous with massive distribution of average quality wine in France. You can do better than that frankly .

Had a business dinner there last week with 2 colleagues, fabulous food! To start we had foie gras & meat balls, steak tartar, burrata with tomatoes. All very good. We ordered 4 mains - scallops & pork belly, tenderloin, baked cod in miso, lamb short ribs (which was the only miss of the evening). One bottle of Italian red and a few beers and the bill came to about $450 (Singapore). Will definitely be going back
3
If the aim of this place is to ensure diners leave disgruntled, they surely nailed it! It's very overrated, exorbitantly priced for the portion sizes - brunch menu was quite a disappointed. The food albeit good was in portion sizes of starters with a price tag of mains! Their Irish egg Benedict was good and well presented but would I go back there for it again - not really! Service was quite slack especially for a restaurant which wasn't full! There are plenty of options in Dempsey Hill, which could boast of less 'disgruntled chef'

Just a joy to eat here. Great food - European with Asian twists - beautifully cooked and served. Try its bar next door ("The Library"?) you need a password to get in! Look on-line.
5
we visited this place to try the Sangria and the dessert recommended by a friend.
unfortunately, we were not allowed to enter as the place was book for an event.
try to call folks before going to this place.
4
Original menu with nice variety of menu items. Also had some great cocktails to start with. We sat on a high table which is near the bar. Makes it lively and fun. Good service
4
Nice small upscale restaurant with fresh food in the Dempsey Hill area, hard to find at night! Only problem is we were having a great time, and around closing time, we were kindly informed that they wanted us to leave.
3
Nice quiet, relaxing ambience and Dempsey is so convenient to get to and park - but the food at Disgruntled Chef is not worth the price you pay. Portions are small as well.
4
Set in lush greenery, is this gem of a restaurant with good food at reasonable prices. Would have happily given it 5 stars except that the service was intermittent and stretched. Main dishes arrived over a period of 45 minutes and they completely missed out our side dishes. Having said that, the food we did get was pretty good. Macaroni and cheese, truffle pasta, crispy lamb ribs and roasted beets are not to be missed. Pigs ears are a must try once type of dish. The tenderloin, chicken roulade and monkfish stew were good. Sticky toffee pudding is a great dessert here. Give the vanilla flan a miss. The wait staff were earnest and helpful but I think very stretched.
2
Food is ok. But the portion is enough for toddler. Anyone older than that will need 3x. So, be prepared to pay 3x than other restaurants. I was joking with my friends. We should call this Disgruntled Patrons.Anyway, this restaurant is overrated. We ended up have to go to a seafood restaurant to continue our dinner
3
Tried it. Had the kurobuta pork, was rather tasteless. And the stuff it was served with, tasted like barley which isn't my cup of tea but was also rather tasteless. The beef ribs are much better. The desserts were deconstructed style.. which was ok. For the price one pays, it's not a place I would return to. Service was generally good though. Wine was ok too but as per most places in SG, expensive. But at least good pairing. But in the end, been and don't think I'll be back. Neither of the other 3 people who dined also felt like they would come back. So..

I'd wanted to thank my brother for his hospitality during my stay in Singapore, so naturally I scoured the net after deciding to stop in on Dempsey Hill, having heard such great things about the restaurant options.After looking through a few local food blogs/review sites, I'd settled on The Disgruntled Chef since the photos looked pretty tasty and the diners seemed quite happy.Three of us shared the following (Amount listed in SGD):-- Fried Fish Skin & Potato Chips ($9) -- Truffle Mac & Cheese ($29) -- The Crackling Suckling Pig ($68) -- Bone Marrow w/Snail (Can't remember, $25+) -- Jug of Lychee Mojito ($48) -- Chcolate Fondant -- Toffee Pudding -- Blue Cheese Dark Chocolate Bar Can't remember the exact price of each of the dessert items, but they ranged between $10-$18. Why is this important? Because this review is based on what I thought of the value for what we ate. Which, FELT expensive. I understand the concept of sharing plates, hence the designation of big plates, small plates, but for what you get for your buck... it just didn't cut it for any of us at the table, and all three of us at the table are prolific eaters who are acquainted with eating well. Just as an example, the suckling pig was not so exquisite as to warrant the $68 price tag. The lychee mojito was sweet and refreshing but both the amount of ice and near absence of rum watered down (pun intended) whatever savings they were offering with a jug as opposed to an individual cocktail. There's no reason to be overly critical, and since I was asked how the meal was at the end of it by the host and I said "good," that's my answer. The problem lies in the fact that all of it was just good. There was nothing great that we'd go back for, nothing that we had that blew us away... and that's unfortunate. (I'd give it a 3.5 star but it wasn't an option.

Finally something a little different and tasty. Tried the crispy lamb ribs. Have not had anything like this...absolutely delicious ! Also, tried their mac&cheese (with black truffles and crawfish). Amazing! What is also great about this restaurant is their cocktails. Their G&T (a twist on a gin and tonic) with lime foam and rosebuds tasted like more! We went to the Restaurant in Dempsey Hill. Small and intimate restaurant in a beautiful setting. Outdoor eating available. Recommend reservations
4
The three-course set at S$33 (before taxes) was a good deal. The choices were decent, and serving sizes were ample. Food quality was very good.
4
Located away from hustle and bustle of the city, this restaurant offers a relaxing environment with great food. The staff were friendly and attentive and were happy to explain what was on the menu. It was quite pricey tough but it is worth it.
5
Can't big this place up enough! Twice we have been there now and both times we have been treated with such individuality and personal service. The staff are all so attentive and are straight on to your every need. The food is cooked from the heart and is presented in quirky artistic ways and it all tastes sublime. The location in Dempsey is tucked away and makes you feel like you have transported out of the city for a few blissful hours! Like I said, can't recommend this place enough .....
5
We visited this new location just a couple of days after they opened and I'm very pleased we did. Our main waitress took charge and charmed us with her friendly style while also training up some of the new staff - a tough thing to do but she did it very well.The food was fantastic. Some innovative dishes showing that the chef is a talented guy. We tried melt-in-the-mouth carpaccio paired with a watermelon-tomato-tartare. It was a great combination - watermelon and tomato is a new combination for me and you could taste the quality of ingredients. The sort of thing that you would be inspired to try and copy at home (and fail at!). I loved the crispy beef short rib after that. I gave up wondering how this had been prepared and just enjoyed the super beef flavour and texture that had been created. This cow had been shown total respect - it takes a lot of time to get the beef to be that good.There were many dishes on the menu that we were choosing between but everything we selected was great. New tastes and flavours - maybe the chef has got his gruntle back now and it would be worth checking this place out to see what new things are going on. This isn't the sort of food your mother made

A great Saturday afternoon spent at a quiet little restaurant on Dempsey Hill with a good wine selection and a great little menu. Unfortunately as it was Saturday lunch the whole menu was not available but next time. we had a good afternoon, the owner manager was really attentive unfortunately is staff were not as friendly and service orientated but the food was excellent and I had seconds. well situated and nice and quiet for a lazy Saturday afternoon
1
The restaurant name is mostly right, except it is the customers that leave disgruntled, it is not the chef. Firstly the service - our waitress was exceptionally hard to understand and did a very poor job of communicating. Each time we asked a question we had to ask "what?" Or "come again?" at least twice to understand. Second the prices were EXORBITANT for the quantity received, and for the quality. The appetizer was almost $20 and was approx one tomato, cubed, with a small amount of burrata plus olive oil. The "tartines" were well in excess of $20 and consisted of a slice of bread and then various toppings. The duck confit was not confit, rather an oily spread more akin to tuna spread, and had no depth of taste that I would expect at that price point. The lobster was better, but again the quantity was not what I'd expect. I would not come back, and would advise the restaurant to up its game if they want to maintain that price point.
4
Was searching for a place to treat a couple friend to dinner to celebrate their belated birthday. Read about it at trip advisor and went ahead. True to most who had reviewed, it's a nice cosy small restaurant with very attentive staff and good food. It's pricey but the quality of the food makes it worthy. Will go again with girlfriends next...The sticky pudding is awesome, miso cod just melts in your mouth. Oh the fried fish skin is divine..
4
Love the ambience and food. Not a kid friendly place though the staff was nice and friendly to kids. There were no baby chair or children cutlery. No problem just need to know to avoid if dining with young children. Will return for meals without kids next time.
4
It was bring your own bottle night. I was with a couple of friends & everything about the evening was great. The staff were very attentive & quick to put our white wine on ice. The food was yummy, the atmosphere & overall service was fab!
4
Heard good reviews about this restaurant from friends and family members who have been but finally got a chance to try it out for dinner. Food is served tapas style with small plates and big plates . Ordered lobster and crab meat sliders and cod fish amongst other dishes which included a salad. The chef has obviously given thought to the menu as there is a good variety of dishes to choose from.We enjoyed every dish which we ordered. The presentation of the food was also good. There was an unusual blue cheese and honey topped with chocolate coating for ice-cream (it came in an ice -cream stick) which lovers of blue cheese should try. The blue cheese taste is not too overwhelming and balanced by the honey and chocolate. Surprisingly, for the quality of the dishes pro-offered, the pricing was to be reasonable.I left the opposite of disgruntled and plan to return
4
I can't criticise anything at this place, the food is wonderful, the staff are welcoming and friendly and it has a niche atmosphere. Will definitely come back again.

The dinner venue tonight was The Disgruntled Chef, located at the trendy Dempsey Hill. An interesting modern-European restaurant and bar concept hidden beneath a flight of wooden steps - how lovely and secluded. Consisting of a contemporary and vintage-glamor design, the restaurant offered good service as well.We had the Crab & Lobster Sliders (SGD$14.00) was another delicacy that we were glad to have ordered - small lobster and crab rolls topped with thin slivers of Granny Smith apples. The bread roll had a lovely fluffy, fresh texture to it, going very well with the luscious flavor of the minced seafood meat and crunchiness of apple slivers.Then we took something from the "big plate" section to share - Grilled French Quail (SGD$32.00), served with Frisee Salad, Crispy Bacon and Poached Egg. If you love quail - well, its taste is very similar to duck meat, only smoother and more tender. This one had a bonus hint of smokiness to enhance the flavor, and was incredibly scrumptious.*Helen had a Sea Salt & Chilli Margarita (SGD$18.00) for drinks - Don Julio Reposado, calamansi, Honey, Sea Salt Air. This drink was a major WOW to the tastebuds - refreshing, yet spicy, getting the palate all tangy in its exotic flavor.For full review and more information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/dinner-at-disgruntled-chef-dempsey-hill.htm

We have been going there regularly & its only after we had my Birthday there in Feb that the staff started recognising us, except for Christina, their loyal Eastern European waitress who has a fantastic way to make you welcome!The food is delicious, portions are JUST the right size and although we don't like the sequence in which the chef sends the dish in, we forgive him as it is always good food he sends over!The staff now knows that I like my Foie gras starter WITH bread ( as we do in France) & I am now working on implementing it on the menu!!!!
5
The food was really awesome - had the scallop carpaccio as starter and veal chop and Miso cod. Crew were really friendly and efficient in getting the orders.
5
What's the opposite of being disgruntled? For me it's yummy cocktails, truly memorable food and easy parking. But seriously, the bone marrow OH the bone marrow. My wife and I, for the first time ever, discussed what makes the inside of bones so delicious. On par with it was the salt of the sea, crispy fried fish skin. We couldn't stop, not that we wanted to. Unfortunately the sticky toffee date pudding isn't up there anymore, it's still good but not Instagram worthy. Anyhow finding one dish you would kill for is remarkable, but two in the same night? Makes this a 5-star experience.
3
Our server was friendly and helpful. He told us this was akin to a tapas bar where we are encouraged to order a variety for sharing. We did just that. The food was an eclectic mix of different styles, creative ingredients and quite delicious. Both starters and mains were equally captivating, some more impressive than others, crab meat pasta was great, bone marrow quite unusual, fish skin yummy, tomato fresh, lamb spiced and flavorful. Dessert was more usual fare, creamed brûlée, chocolate cake, well executed. I would go there again. Just a tad expensive
5
Located at Dempsey, where gathered so much good restaurants that I have been planning to try one by one. This time was The Disgruntled Chef that I am so impressed by the SEA SALT & CHI LLI MARGARITA, CRISPY LAMB SHORTRIBS, GAMBAS PI L PI L. Add those on you MUST-TRY list
3
$38++ for a set lunch, it comes with a starter (portion quite small, choices of soup, vegetarian, poached prawns), main course (normal portion-choices of fish, ravioli, meat, turkey), dessert of the day. They will change the menu time to time...We order additional sides and main too. we tried the suckling pig and lamb shank. Personally I prefer the authentic Chinese suckling pig. The lamb shank is average, abit over roasted, meat was quite dry.It is more on fusion cuisine. The restaurant is not very big, advise to make a reservation before going
4
Great food and attentive staff ensured we thoroughly enjoyed our evening. We sat outside (inside the AC was way too fresh - even by Singaporean standards) and took three small plates and a large plate with two sides (plenty for two people) with a bottle of wine. Portions weren't stingy and favors were varied and surprising. We finished with sticky date pudding (AMAZING!!!). The mosquito coils were much appreciated too!
4
Tuck in the quiet corner on Dempsey Hill, The Disgruntled Chef is flawless decorated and designed, bringing the old charms of the 70's black and white fine dining back.Great selection of starters and main courses that timely served.Also great selection of wines for the perfect Friday night unwinding. Don't miss this place if you're around in Dempsey
4
My Friend and i went to disgruntled chef last week.. the food was really good...i will recommend it to colleagues and friends..will surely visit again....
2
Small overpriced portions, slow service - it was twenty minutes from the time the first person was served until the sixth person got their food
More of a bar than a restaurant
3
I have to say that the quality of the food here is pretty good, although as noted by another reviewer, truffle oil is their favourite ingredient - it's in everything! The crayfish mac and cheese was excellent and the other dishes we had were also good. The only letdown was the "special" truffle pasta which was a bit bland and oily.The restaurant was extremely cold - even by Singapore standards. To be fair, they did adjust the temperature when asked. The main drawback with this restaurant is the portion sizes. I think that for the price, the portions could be a bit bigger for many of the dishes. This would have been a five star review, but for the portion size.The staff were friendly and made some good recommendations
4
I went on a weekend for brunch. A nice venue for a daytime meal. The food was nice - well presented. The a la carte dishes look better than some of the brunch dishes. The service however was slow so don't expect to get out in a hurry. Also the meal wasn't great value for what you get.
5
This is an old favourite of mine because the food is so good and you can go here for almost any occasion. Weekend brunch is informal but classy, great for groups or families with kids, with a light Asian take on American/Aussie favourites. Evening dinner inside is low-key and outside downright romantic, in either case the food is superb.Try 2 or 3 small plates - the Salt of the Sea (fried fish skin and crisps with Japanese vinegar) is one of our favourite snacks, steak tartare, pissaladiere and burratina also excellent. Of the big plates (mains to share) the lamb shortribs, mussles and sucking pig are also well worth a try. Friendly and attentive service too - a rarity in Singapore - all in all, highly recommended.
2
Wanted to try something different in Dempsey Hill and with the clever name, this place was our choice. Positives: good vibe, lively crowd, good cocktails. Negatives: The service was slow, the portions are small, and the food is not that good because it is greasy. Truffle oil plays a big role in many of the dishes flavor profiles - and I've personally had enough of the truffle oil thing. Cool name for a restaurant though..
3
Nice casual Sunday brunch amongst the trees at Dempsey Hill. Short menu but enough to satisfy.We had very good service. It's not the hustle of ps cafe nearby so felt quite chilled. Cool music in the background also helped. The brunch menu on weekends has a selection of tartines, see pic, as well as a few hearty mains of the day, like steak / roast chicken. The tartines are like bruschetta with the toppings and accompaniments as per the menu.We'll come back to try the dinner
3
I could go on about how ridiculous the prices are compared to the value, but that would be boring. I could go on about the portion sizes, but that would be boring. The hair thin slices of clams that you couldnt taste since there was almost no content to taste. The lobster pasta I had was far too oily/greasy, but my companions did enjoy their meals. Some of the food was terrific, so clearly the chef is skilled, but this restaurant tries too hard I think. Could do better ..
5
I have been here on 3 occasions both for work and socially and on all occasions the service, food and wine has been excellent. It is a fairly small restaurant in Dempsey and as the whole area is a converted military camp it is a bit quirky and fairly remote (for Singapore), which is actually very nice.I'd recommend the suckling pig (slow cooked for 8 hours) or the Miso Cod.They also have a Grüner Veltliner on the wine list which again is fairly unusual in Singapore.Only downside is you need a taxi but they aren't expensive in Singapore and from the restaurant to the CBD for example will cost around $18 SGD (£9)
4
It is a great place for catching up with friends or to have a date night. We ordered a few dishes to share. The more outstanding items are the snow crab pasta, grilled french quail and crackling suckling pig. Do leave space for the sticky date pudding too. It's really yummy
2
A well designed menu and arguably good food does not make up for a complete disregard of the front of house. Given the extortionate prices, you should expect a modicum of service but you will be sadly disappointed. While not actively rude, the staff were indifferent at best. We ordered the expensive bottled water, only to have to reach over to an ice bucket and pour it ourselves all evening. The food came out before cocktails because "the bar is overwhelmed"??!!!! After which our jug of cocktails was poured once and then unceremoniously placed on an adjacent table so we would have to get up and refill our own glasses. Finally, they couldn't sort out their kitchen operations enough, so there was a total lag of 20 minutes between the first and last dish appearing at the table. Effectively meaning that different members of the party eating at different times. Yes, and without cocktails, because those came last. I honestly think that if you can't sort out the front of house, you should close. There is a absolutely no way you can justify these prices when you can't operationally manage a Friday night. No excuses necessary. Every other fine dining restaurant in the world manages to get it together.
5
this was a nice place.. despite the name, none is disgruntled here.. intact they are quite friendly... a friend of mine who is vegetarian came along randomly with us to dine. the chef made a special special meal just for her to carter to her needs. that was only because there was no pure vegan dish on the menu.. my friend is from Oregon USA.. so bug Vegan.. lovely place, lovely everything.. i would love to go everyday if possible..
4
A high-quality option at Dempsey Hills, tucked away in the woods. A slightly fussy menu gives way to well-prepared tasty food. The Crispy lamb short rib was superb - so tasty & so different. Service was good too as was the surprise birthday pudding for our friend. Lovely
3
The Disgruntled Chef was one of my favourite restaurants in Dempsey, and we chose to dine there Friday last. I was surprised to find that the restaurant was only half full, as the other two restaurants we had called were fully booked. We arrived and were recognized by the waitress who usually serves us, and seated on the usual table. Very nice - just like coming home. On looking at the menu I was dismayed to find that some of my favourite dishes were not there anymore. I asked what had happened and was told the menu had been revised on the Monday. My favourite appetiser foire gras on a bed of prunes, and the lamb ribs had both been removed as had the seared scallops. I settled for the scallop capriccio which wes acceptable but nowhere as tasty as the seared scallops. The lamb ribs deleted as a starter had been reinstated as a main course which my colleague ordered - just as tasty but not much larger than they were as a starter course - so disappointed by the size. The ambiance and service were unchanged but overall the change of menu was disappointing - why reinvent the wheel when it works - to my mind and in my humble opinion there was no need for change. Wine selection was still excellent and we settled for a bottle of Vina Esmeralda - perfectly crisp and a great choice. Concluding in short: a good evening but not as good as before. Would not prevent me from dining there but would not be on my preferred choice nowadays.Dinner for two with wine $ 326 - not too expensive by Singapore standards.
4
Starting off on the point around service. Several people had commented on TA that the service was lacking, this was definitely not the case this evening. Very attentive service all evening from all waiting staff. Got a table outside to enjoy the lush surroundings. We were not too hungry so just ordered a selection of small plates. Started off with the crispy fish skin with vinegar which was delicious. Ordinarily it comes with fries but I'm not eating carbs so they just did extra skin. Following the fish skin we had the beef tartare such was delicious with a couple of quails eggs. Next were the lamb short ribs which were well seasoned and nice and crispy. Finally we had the bone marrow. As the kitchen had elected to keep the bone marrow in its original form it meant that it wasn't really seasoned all through, just on the top. It was still absolutely delicious but would recommend the kitchen remove the bone marrow season and then add back. For drinks we went with a jug of lemongrass mohito, which for $42 was very good value. All in all a really pleasant experience.
4
Quite simply a nice venue serving a selection of good dishes which can be enjoyed Tapas style. Service was good and we were told how long each dish would take to prepare. Good night out
2
We were disappointed by this restaurant which looks as if it should be good with modern, trendy decor in a nice setting. We were a large group and so shared some starters: the steak tartare was deemed tasty but meagre; the grilled garlic prawns were mushy, and the beet and orange salad a bit tired. Our miso cod was both horribly expensive and overcooked - dry as a bone, and tasteless. The suckling pig was deemed disgusting - and was exorbitant. I won't be going there agai
3
If you can shut out the loud noise of the other diners and the bar, the food is excellent. The other aspect that you need to overlook is the hit and miss service. Whilst I can understand the staggered delivery of the small plate appetisers (sort of), delivering our desserts 10 minutes apart wasn't good. Maybe this is a good place to go in a group rather than as a couple.
4
Fancy pub-grub. Food is good, portion size varies though, two orders of the same item came in radically different quantities. We had a friendly joking waitress and excellent service. Also one of the few places where drinks are not watered down. You pay for the location though
3
We came here for lunch and food was generally blah. My salmon parfait was tasteless and my husband's fried portobello mushroom tasted of just oil and nothing else. The rest of the courses we had like the stuffed chicken and the sticky date pudding was forgettable (i.e it wasnt bad but certainly nothing to go out of your way for). The most memorable dish was also the worst dish: my husband ordered the profiteroles which saw the pastry crispy with a distinct burnt taste. I would sum this place up as somewhere you go if you're looking for nice ambience but if it's food you're wanting then do yourself a favour and take your stomach elsewhere
4
Went for dinner. Attentive staff but food can be a bit slow at times. The suckling pig and scallops was great
2
A dining ambience completes a dining experience.Although the menu was creative and very favourable on the palate, the torn sunken seats, tables too close to each other and loud conversations all around, to me, makes it to be a canteen atmosphere, yet paying above average prices to dine there
4
The menu is not huge.. but the food is really nice. Last visit had seafood maccaroni followed by lamb ribs with chilli rub. My friends had the beef cheek - meat was tender and tasted great. We all went for the same dessert - Sticky toffee pudding with vanilla icecream
4
The food was good, the staff was very nice but it took a bit of time to get the grub.... we were even given an additional dessert compliments of the chef. we went on a sunday afternoon and got the brunch option. the lamb chops were very very good....we had two portions of those..... the meat was tender and cooked perfectly....i only thought that the lamb smelled a bit ....but my wife always says that i am too finnicky and like mutton more than lamb......it always smells a bit more than mutton......the eggs benedict was nice - light and fluffy - quails eggs - so pretty small in size - like capers - you could pop each one in pretty easily....the salmon quiche was a bit of a let down - it was a normal quiche with a couple of salmon chunks on top...... in my mind the picture i had was with the salmon more ingrained into the quiche itself - maybe that is because of my lack of experience in cooking...but nevertheless.... it was not that great.... i would probably give this one a miss while the others i would always go for again. the roach chicken with foie gras was also good.....very delicate..... the icing on the cake was the dessert with caramel toffee - it was just divine....very very nice.....i am willing to visit this restaurant again just to have this.we sat outside because our little kid was sleeping and there was ample space there. there is no view to talk about as there is a literally a wall of trees almost bang in front.... in the evening the mosquitoes might be too much company also despite the mosquito repellants being there.... inside should be much better.... the decor is a bit spartan...but then who cares as long as the food is good
5
Two couples visited for a quite evening of dining in the open air. The European flavored restaurant did not disappoint. The roast chick was superb, as was the caprese salad, and the profiteroles. Definitely worth another visit
4
This is a favorite place to share with friends and visitors to Singapore. Nice outdoor setting for casual dining feel. Innovative cocktailsThe menu is truly wonderful and serving portions generous. Must try - pulled pork sandwich- caprese salad- curry mussels- ginger bee

It was a late Sunday lunch and intended to go to PS Cafe at Dempsey Hill. It was a 1.5 hour wait so we walked out and went to the next restaurant which was The Disgruntled Chef. We are all pleasantly surprised as the food was quite good. For the appetizer, I had the crispy lamb shortribs which had like a mediterranean rub. It was very tasty and cooked perfectly -- tender and juicy. For the main, I had the Roasted Miso Cod with mushrooms and baby spinach and it was fantastic. The flavor of the mushrooms and spinach did not over power the cod. The cod was perfectly cooked which was bursting with flavor. The winner was the dessert -- Roquefort Magnum --- roquefort and honey ice cream coated in dark chocolate. Don't be deceived as it is looks like your grocery ice cream served in a bowl of ice. But take a bite and its a blue cheese flavored ice cream with the right balance of sweetness from the honey and dark chocolate. Perfect ending to a meal!The only down side are -- first, the menu is not so clear "Brunch Smalls" and "Brunch Bigs", who would have known it meant appetizers and mains? Second, the servers are not familiar with the menu so its quite frustrating if you want to know more about a dish. Lastly, the service is very slow. We didn't notice it so much since I was dining with friends whom I have not seen so we were catching up. But we did notice that it took them 45mins to serve our dessert
4
Delicious food. Ordered primarily off the starter/tapas menu and had 1main to share amongst 4. It was all delicious. Restaurant is very noisy though so hard to have a conversation with friends while eating. Got overwhelmingly loud at times, but food was good enough to warrant a return visit. Just be ready for the noise. Good set lunch values

For more pics and an in depth review, please visit my blog at: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/2013/7/17/the-disgruntled-chefI feel like the Disgruntled Chef hasn't gained as much coverage as it deserves. When it comes to Tapas, the most talked about restaurants tend to be Esquina, Catalunya, Sabio, etc. So I wasn't expecting much on my visit but must say, I was pleasantly surprised at the fare (not so much by the cocktails, but we can't have everything). Everything was delectable and cooked perfectly. I specifically loved the lamb short ribs which were crispy on the outside whilst soft and tender on the inside, falling straight off the bone. I also loved the fish skin which was freshly cooked and came out warm and incredibly crispy! I suppose the only thing the Disgruntled Chef is lacking in is its ambience. It's a bit dated and lacking the excitement and hustle bustle that Esquina and Sabio have. For more of my foodie thoughts, please visit my blog above

After looking at the many restaurants Dempsey Hill offers my partner and I decided to try The Disgruntled Chef. Overall we were pretty disappointed with this overpriced restaurant. We were sat a table by the bar as the restaurant was full (that was fine) and ordered some aspargus as a starter then chicken and chops as mains. They brought out the wrong asparagus dish (the $24 dish instead of the $8) one and instead of just letting us have the one they brought they remade the dish. The chicken was nice but was literally just chicken with a bit of stuffing on the side - no greens at all, and the chops were average. The staff are really unprofessional towards one another. The head waitress (who is very good) got visibly angry at 3 other wait staff during the night in full view of the restaurant. The bill for the above three dishes, a side salad and 4 drinks was $170 which in my opinion is outrageous for a restaurant that claims to be 'casual dining' and has average food

The food was really good. I like the idea of lots different dishes a nice way to eat. The wine was good along with good service it's a nice place to eat. A little pricey but definitely will go back.

We decided to try this restaurant after reading the reviews and also passing by it when in Dempsey Hill. It did not disappoint us. We ordered mostly nibbles and small plates.Patata and takoyaki came deliciously prepared. Lamb short ribs were very tasty. Well prepared, as the meat fell off the bone easily.Bone marrow came with slices of bread so you may mop the bone, and ample parsley.I like the way each dish comes with an interesting sauce or dip. We only ordered one main dish to share, there were three of us, the miso cod.Quality of the cod was not premium, but the cooking style, doneness of the cod, was impeccable.We couldn't leave without trying the desserts, so we settled for the deconstructed cheesecake and the sticky date with ice cream. What a great way to end the meal, both were quite yummy.There was only one glitch in the meal service. Food stopped coming after the nibbles. Apparently, when the order was put in , the waitress asked for the meal to be staggered. It became a huge hiccup. Perhaps it would be better if the diner was asked if they would like a continuous service or a staggered one. Some like a pause, others don't.The waitress was profusely apologetic.For that, it made things better.Ambience was lovely, lighting good, they have an outdoor space if you prefer to dine this way. They thoughtfully provide a standing aircon unit for humid nights ;-)I feel they are receptive to suggestions and we will definitely return for more good food

Sat at the bar for a solo dinner during a recent visit to Singapore. This is an elegant, but not a formal restaurant in Dempsey Hill with pleasant, friendly and attentive staff.For my small plate, I chose a shrimp/chorizo dish cooked in a crisp pastry case. This wasn't a great success. Although the combination of shrimp and chorizo was excellent, the decision to cook them in a papilotte was a mistake. The oil from the chorizo made the pastry tough and soggy. My entree was much more successful - braised short rib served with mushrooms and parsnip puree - and delicious, as was the sticky toffee pudding dessert.Expect $90 (Singapore) per person for 3 courses + a glass of wine, no coffee. Certainly quite expensive, but well worth it in my view

We have been going to The Disgruntled Chef since it's opening and are recognised as repeat customers (though we don't visit very often).The cuisine is edgy with some really interesting touches of finesse but can be at time uneven.This Sunday saw us ordering The Steak Tartare which was absolutely delicious wish a soft quail egg. The corn beef hash was unsurprising and I have actually no recollection of eating it (despite the fact that I remember ordering it). The grilled asparagus was very solid (as in demonstrating some know how) with a wonderful soft cook egg.As we tend to err on the side of pigginess, the two of us ordered three desserts (isn't what you are supposed to do)? The Roquefort Magnum is the most interesting and has been on the menu for a little while and is revisited with great pleasure. The Sticky Toffee pudding was very indulgent. The profiteroles seem to be lacking some inspiration... you can skip the profiteroles...Please Disgruntled Chef, do bring back the baked camembert..

Came here with a friend for a late lunch / brunch on a Sunday, what a little gem. The concept of sharing all the food is right up my alley, love the idea of getting a taste of everything! The menu was extensive and supported by a black board range as well. Each dish we had was presented nicely with great individual flavors. The mozzarella was the best I have had in a long time. The wine list extensive and for those not wanting wine there were plenty of other options including fresh juices. We sat inside although there is a good undercover outside section as well. Our waitress was great, attentive and just as one expects a service professional to be, makes the whole experience of dining out even more of a pleasant experience. A place I need to bring all my friends to

Great food and even better service. Didn't get the name of the staff who served us but she's a petite lady who very kindly explained the menu and recommended our choices for the night. She was also very attentive and a definite asset to the restaurant.. Moving on to the food, the lamb ribs were awesome and the misi cod was good too. Will definitely come by again soon..

I was recommended to this restaurant by a friend and now we cant stay away! The menu is fun and we just love the croquettas and the burrata cheese, actually all of it is good. I love going to this restaurant with friends so we can try lots of different dishes. The cocktails are fab. There is a great guy here, called Hedi, and right from the first time of visiting he remembered us, and remembered our names. He makes amazing cocktails and he is so friendly. There are also some good wines on the menu.All in all, the Disgruntled Chef has become a bit of a regular haunt! Check it out - you wont be disappointed

Food pretty good but not worth the price, bad/inexperience service, staff could not coherently or describe simply their recommendations for ordering, tables are far too wide apart for customers to have a proper conversation, music far too loud. All in all, a very stressful experience and won't be returning agai

Solid; for the price, I was not taken aback, but simple flavors and amazing service won me over.FOODYou know that frustrating feeling when the menu description doesn’t match the plate of food you receive? I hate that, but the opposed case occurred here; every expectation created by the menu description was met. Black Truffle Sandwiches: three tiny finger sandwiches, each bursting with truffles and Brie. It really was a ‘nibble’, but anymore would have been overwhelming. Caprese Salad: Huge plate of un-ripened tomatoes, but the roasted beets and burrata made up for it. Baked Bone Marrow: I haven’t really had bad bone marrow, but this was exceptionally good. Melts once it enters your mouthLamb Shortribs: Probably the highlight; crispy outside and juicy inside, falling off the bone. Pan Con Tomate: Another highlight. I like that it lacked garlic, since the bread tasted so fresh. Again small portion, but a lot of flavor. The whiskey sour was also the best cocktail I’ve had in SEA (not saying a lot since SEA is not known for cocktails).SERVICEThe service alone pushed me from a three to four star. Our waiter was attentive, described the dishes accurately, and had honest recommendations. Another bonus was the fact that other waiters were not shy about making sure we had everything we needed. Opened the door for us upon arrival and departure.ATMOSPHEREDisgruntled chef stands apart from Singapore’s gaudy grandiose restaurant scene. The place was simple, earthy and unpretentious, but maintained a highbrow feel because of the service’s attention to detail

First time trying The Disgruntled Chef and was surprised that it has been around. Initially, we had a bit of a problem locating the restaurant which is situated in a corner of Dempsey, across from Tawandang. As we got to The Disgruntled Chef, we realised why it was difficult to find, the back of the restaurant faces Tawandang, and the front (with its al fresco dining area) faces the forested area, we loved the atmosphere.Food was superb, there were four of us, so we tried almost all the "small plates". Lamb, mini-pulled pork sandwich, truffle bikini, steak tartare with quails egg, duck liver parfait were outstanding. We also had two "big plates", Fideau (similar to paella, but with noodles instead) and Charcoal Steak. Both were easy to share and were excellent, I especially liked the smokiness of the steak.Pricing was not cheap but very fair for the quality of food we got. They have no-corkage Tuesdays, so we will be back on a Tuesday with a good bottle.Highly Recommended

i just like their concept but nothing make its special even the food itself. But i like ther bake bone marrow. Bt still the portioning is a alittle bit small for my appetite.
5
It is a relaxed atmosphere, small establishment, with original food. Try the bone marrow. Rich but oh so good.

Food was pretty good, the pork belly was best dish on the menu. They need to work out the service, they were all over us for the first 15 minutes, then they just vanished.

We visited the restaurant after review from a famous food blogger here in Singapore.So we had a high expectation for the taste and flavor of the food.We got there Sunday night, there were about 4 other tables, so it was not that crowded.We ordered 4 dishes:crispy lamb shortribssteak tartaresalt of the seaSquid ink noodlesI would say, all of them were decent food, but not spectacular and memorable in the flavor area. Something just missing.Salt of the Sea/ crispy fish skin taste interesting, but they didn't have a nice sauce to go with it, so a bowl of crackers after a while felt a bit boring.But the ambience was very nice and quite romantic and the waiter was also polite. Will I come back for their dinner? No...because it's too pricey for the quality of the food I had. Maybe I will try their brunch menu sometimes

My wife & I visited The Disgruntled Chef, after rave reviews from this site and a friend.The restaurant is located in the popular bar & restaurant area of Dempsey Hill and is relatively easy to find (after some hunting with our taxi driver).We found the dishes quite variable: The ham and pastry creation we started with was delicious and raised our expectations. The lamb ribs, with spices was cooked well, nicely crunchy on the outside, with soft meat. However, we both were disappointed with the lack of flavours. The famous bone marrow did not go down well with either of us as we both found it very fatty indeed. The scallop ceviche was, similarly, lacking in seasoning & flavours.The desserts made up for the main course a little. The chocolate mousse and Catalan dessert were both delicious, with liberal additions of sea salt to enhance the flavours.Unluckily, we were sitting next to a large table with a group of slightly drunk and rowdy guests, who insisted on loudly sharing their conversation with us and hitting on the girls on a night out on an adjoining table. Nothing over the top, just not helpful for the atmosphere.The service was fine: Swift and attentive and efficient

We decided to return to The Disgruntled Chef for Valentine's dinner, thankfully they are one of the few nicer restaurants in Singapore that don't have some gimicky Valentine's menu which have inflated prices, rather they just kept to their regular menu (and prices). We have been to TDC before and liked the food and ambience there, we were delighted that they have updated their menu recently.We ordered Black Truffle Bikini sandwiches as an accompaniment to our cocktails, these were fragrant but not over-powering. Next we had the Scallop Ceviche and the Baby Octopus, I must say that this is the best Ceviche that I have had in a long while, the baby octopus was surprisingly tender and flavorful. Next came the Smoked Ribeye which was excellent (I think the best I have had in Singapore). The ribeye had amazing smokiness and the flavor of the medium-rare beef was so good that we did not even need the sauce that accompanied it.The last time we were here, we tried the Sticky Pudding and the Molten Chocolate Cake which were really good, so this time we tried the Roquefort Magnum (a magnum ice-cream on a stick, but made of roquefort cheese) and the Chocolate Mousse (we are dessert lovers), both desserts were awesome, we wished we had room for more.Overall, we love The Disgruntled Chef

A large group of us went to The Disgruntled Chef for Saturday night dinner and sampled just about every item on the menu, spending over $2,000. The food was excellent, but the bill was large for the quantities served. The restaurant offers what seem to be very good value weekday lunchtime specials, but in the evening the prices soar.The concept is that diners select a mix of "small plates" and "big plates" and share them. So the 500 grams of steak comes on a platter, already cut up and cubed ($98). The "whole chicken" is de-boned and served as two breasts and two legs on a bed of spinach ($38). The parma ham comes in six slices with six cherry tomatoes and six melon balls ($18, I think). The suckling pig ($68) was tender with crunchy crackling skin and was cut up in a bowl. This concept is fine, but the glaring absence is of reasonable side dishes to accompany the meat-heavy "big plates". No bread is available - although toast is served with the excellent roasted bone marrow; no chips (French fries) are available (despite the fact that they would be perfect accompaniments to the steak and chicken). Neither small side salads can be ordered, nor side orders of vegetables like asparagus and creamed spinach, which most steakhouses offer. The menu featured a creamy and delicious crayfish macaroni cheese ($18), and one of the mains came with a side dish of gratinated potatoes which were excellent, but the overall effect was meat and fish heavy. The deepfried scallops were tender and succulent, but would have benefited from more greens to accompany them. Try the short lamb ribs as a tapas style finger starter.The desserts were better priced and well executed - my wife enjoyed a very rich sticky date pudding and my neighbour enjoyed a molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.The service was better than average for Singapore, although the staff were most reluctant to let you pour your own cans of soda water and diet Coke, keeping them at the counter in a rather annoying way. The wine was decantered for aeration and the waitstaff were attentive.I'm not sure I would come back to the Disgruntled Chef as a couple or a small group, and I am not sure that the $150 per head (with not very much alcohol) was very good value - I was still hungry after the meal. It was a good experience, but a few changes to add more side orders and more vegetables could take the dining experience from good to great

My fifth visit in 12 months. Decided to bring friends from Hong Kong and Australia tonight and they loved it. For the regular menu, make sure you try the crab cakes, beer tartare, bone marrow, suckling pig and lamb spareribs. We had two specials of the day and they were yummy; truffle and brie crepe and truffle risotto. If there is still room for dessert, Chocolate Fondue! Food are served in nibbles portion and great for sharing.

The food is creative and very good. Service is haphazard, although that is true at many restaurants in Singapore lately due to labour shortage. Over-priced for the offering. The restaurant lacks character (we went for lunch, maybe it is more hip in the evening), and even with the good food, the overall experience is not good value
3
If you go when there aren't many people there it's a bit soulless, which is hardly their fault, but even so the music doesn't need to be so loud, or the choice of the young staff, but maybe that's my age. The food is good, but fractionally over-priced for the portion sizes and setting
4
I went with little expectations as most Dempsey eateries are typically all style with little substance and was very pleasantly surprised.Service was attentive and very pleasant, the cocktails were superb with draught Asahi a nice touch also.I cannot for the life of me understand one of the other reviews that says the wine list is terrible, whilst it's not extensive it is balanced and well priced if you know remotely what you're talking about, something for everyone.The food was also very good with innovative dishes. Some people may be disappointed about the portion size sure but the idea of tapas places is to share, you just order more!Overall a very good place for a long lazy brunch like we had and will definitely be going back

Have visited the place three times and found that the food was generally good, done with a lot of passion. It is appealing in dishes' presentation and also tasted reasonably good. But perhaps the menu is kind of limited, we ended up ordering similar things in our 3rd visit. The portions are exceptional small so ... it makes it seemed expensive although the pricing seemed reasonable. The one thing I found really overpriced is the "large plate" suckling pig which cost S$68 and it is really looked like a really small plate to me. If you are willing to sacrifice volume for taste, and not so hungry, then you may be happy with disgruntled chef . Don't come here if you are really hungry, they have nothing that really filled you up.Set lunches on weekdays are of good value and more reasonable portions
4
We go to this place regularly. Definitely a must try for the evening you feel like having a super good cocktail and eat some good food. It is definitely a good combination but...since the cocktails are so good they always score a victim. yes, I was once a victim myself .. margaritas I was having that night..The only downside is the atmosphere is a bit quiet when you arrive at first (then it changes..while having the cocktails
4
Was there last night, made a last minute reservation and was surprised to get a seat...place was full when we got there at 8pm, ordered a wine and cocktail for the 2 of us...Ordered 3 small plates and 1 big plates, the lamb ribs was excellent, the pork neck even more so, and the bone marrow was a delight. Portions was a tad small, but guess thats why they call it small plates.For mains we both shared the mussels, which was cooked to our taste. Mussles were very fresh, and the sauce was good enuf to drink on its own... pity it didnt come with any bread.Service was impeccable, waitress and waiters were very attentive and detailed to our every needs.Overall a good place for dinner, but not a place to go when you are very hungry though
2
The concept and venue has so much potential...too bad the execution falls short. Unresponsive, slow staff + one of the worst wine lists I've seen in Singapore for this type of place really creates a poor overall impression. Our starters were very good (mussels, ham, scallop, etc.) but the pork main course was overcooked and dry. Some deserts were excellent, others tasteless
3
A lot of thought was given to the presentation of the food so you can expect everything here to look pretty. The food items are also very unique so it's great if you are bored of the run-of-mill restaurant. Having said that, the portions are kinda small so if you are looking to be full, go somewhere else. Otherwise, this is a nice place to bring a date.

We found this place by chance as we decided to wander around dempsey hill one Saturday evening. Even though there was no table available immediately they let us sit at the bar and order cocktails while we waited. The table took longer than expected (not that we minded) and as a result, the ever so attentive staff brought out some nibbles for us which were a real treat. The idea of this place is that the food is for sharing so we ordered a selection of six plates. These came out not all at once, but one after the other which was brilliant as it meant we ate slowly and enjoyed every course. The mac and cheese with crayfish was superb, as was the steak tartare and the baked Camembert. But everything (in all honesty) was very delicious. The wines are great a d the staff were attentive without being intrusive and very friendly. The place has a relaxed atmosphere and we had a brilliant experience all in. A great place to celebrate with friends and would go back again in a heart beat

I very much enjoyed dining at this Eurofusion restaurant, nested in a verdant and jungle are of the city. The food was tasty and inventive (had seafood paella with noodles), the wine list satisfying and the service nice and relaxed ( if not somewhat dazed). A definite recommend

I have been to the Disgruntled Chef twice, once for dinner and once for brunch on a Sunday, about 2 months apart. The concept is tapas for sharing - and so rather than everyone ordering a starter and main for themselves, one is encouraged to order several starters and then several mains, all to share. Ditto the dessert. Order a few dishes, eat, then order more. An extremely social experience. The dishes are very varied, and some menu items changed from my first visit to my second visit. All dishes we tried were nice, and our brunch dishes were totally different to our dinner dishes - the tapas experience ensures that everyone has the chance to pile into those dishes they fancy, and pass on those dishes they are not so keen on - the suckling pig seems to be the restaurant's most popular dish, which I am not keen on, but everyone else enjoyed it, and in the meantime all the other dishes we ordered were tasty. The cocktails are a real feature, with an extensive choice, but the barman is happy to make any mixed drink to order. The atmosphere is unhurried, congenial, and service is perfectly efficient and friendly

My husband & I went to Singapore in August. we invited all my cousins to Sunday Brunch at The Disgruntled Chef : altogether about 12 of us. we had a long table and everyone was talking all the time etc. Luckily i had asked the chef to just send some brunch food to the table so one one needed to order. so we had a big varity of food and everyone was very happy and ate lots. the dishes that i liked most was the baby eggs benedict, a special French toast, a salad with soya infused boiled eggs in it, though i tried almost everything. my daughter loved the baby cottage pie and one of my cousins woofed down at least 4 sort of Vietamese mini French rolls with some sort of pate filling: I do not know the name. everyone said how much they loved the food. it was one of my cousin's birthday and the chef quickly made her a little birthday cake: now that was service! so all in all a great restaurant
