Good Andhra food ....!! Had a nice Andhra dosa which was hot and spicy. The restaurant is simple and not expensive. The service is a bit relaxed tho.

Best Place to have Vegetarian food, food options are very simple south Indian but authentic and yummy in taste. I had been regular customer since my stay of 4 years in Singapore
5
We are a regular customer to this place. The food is great. The variety is excellent. Cleanliness and service is good.

The food is tasty, healthy and fresh and the flavours are like home made food. The quality of coffee could be better though. Overall, a must visit recommendation.

Genuine and authentic South Indian Vegetarian food with a homely style service.
Tasted Indian food across the world but yet to find anything close to this from what you can get at home.

Went for Dinner at their famous next door neighbour which was closed on Monday. In no mood to walk father after a tiring day, entered this Restaurant. Good we entered here for a experience not to be missed. The restaurant was mainly managed by a family with three smiling Ladies at the core of it. Authentic South Indian food served with Love.

It is said that a key element of taste in food comes from the attitude and the love of preparing the food. The warmth exuded by the staff is beaten only by the great taste which almost always takes you back to India. Amazing value too and on certain days they let you pay what you feel like. Canâ€™t miss if you have South Indian esp Andhra food pangs in Singapore

Felt we were blessed to have luckily discovered this place. The food is as good as home made and the background chats amplify a pleasant experience. Wonder why very little has been written about this place on the web. Have been to most popular vegetarian joints in Little India, but this one's my winner. Hands down!

Meal: Landed here on Friday night, and visited for brekky Saturday morning. Started with the set breakfast - idli, vadai, masala dosa and pongal accompanied by sambar and two chutneys, washed down with filter coffee.....Fantastic......Went on a binge over the next two days.Ambience: This is not a Michelin restaurant. One comes here for some serious eating and leaves with a smile on one's face. That said, the staff and manager were very courteous without being intrusive. All good.Value: Best South Indian vegetarian food outside of South India (would compete well with some of the South Indian places in India). Food is great, quantities are good, and so cheap.......I will ensure that I will frequent this place in subsequent visits

In the last 6 weeks I visited this place 5 times - for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food was exceptional every time . Pongal for breakfast is easily amongst the best I have had. The vadai is crispy but not overfried. Lunch (Andhra or South Indian ) rest easy on your stomach (unlike some others which would weigh on the stomach) and dosai items are great as well (would recommend the Rava dosai. Yes, it is small and they do get overwhelmed at times in the service - but it's easy to see they are trying their best - and the food and wait is worth it

This is the best tasting South Indian food here in Singapore hands down. All the dishes are authentic and the meals during lunch are wholesome. Have been there on multiple occasions and have not been disappointed yet... !!!

A cozy South Indian budget restaurant. Good vegetarian food. Try the medu vada here. Very crispy and nice!!

The staff are patient and nice. We ordered south india meal and Podi ghee masala. Both are really tasty. But, there were kid's underwear (panties) on the chair... A staff cleaned up slowly after siting at the table for a while...
5
So authentic and home made like. Fresh, piping hot and served with a smile, esp if aunty is there. We always go to this place for breakfast before our tedious Mustafa trips, here or next door MTR, both are awesome

Went to this restaurant twice this week. Both times disappointed. Food was cold and not tasty. We have been visiting this restaurant since it opened and find the standard going down each day. Hope they bring back the old magic!!

Tiffin and full thali was my choice.but neverleless all else is tasty. Elderly women(staff) serve the food ordered with a smile. How nice. Very polite, humble and show interest in your feedback.

This is my second visit. After 9 years in Singapore suffering from chilli attacks and staff lying about how much spice actually is in the food ,I found this place while bringing visitors around town. It looks like an Indian a dinner . Fully vegetarian. What made me go back is the srvice. The aunty who wears a local outfit is really nice and made it very easy for us to understand what kind of food and which one we can eat without chili. She also made great recommendation. .sorry I did not capture the name but you can see my friend's pictures. To add to this the food was delicious
4
We stopped for lunch there. The place is clean and has a homely feel to it. The people are friendly and make sure you get a homely experience. Though it is located next to MTR, it attracts quite a good crowd. We went there on Saturday and had to wait for some time to get seated

This is a very traditional restaurant which serves excellent food. Nothing is spicy hot. Any one can taste the authentic south indian food varieties here without much cost. Their meals are quite a deal though a little bit expensive. The restaurant is run by 3 ladies who are very patient and they make sure everyone gets what they want. I have gone here alone, with family and with friends at various times of the day. It was never disappointing. If you want to try traditional south indian meals served in the orthodox way, this is the one you are looking for. Simply cannot miss !
4
though next to the famous MTR, this place is like walking into a Chennai home....where the 2 sisters roam about barefoot, taking orders, making the dosas and taking great care to personalise your dining experience! I loved it.The idli-podi was finger licking good.the spicy dosa was as said and I really enjoyed it.The chutneys had the freshly grated coconut flavours and were generously served.My husband had the thali and truly appreciated it

South India meal, Dosa, Wada, Pongal and Rava Kichidi are good. Filter coffee is very good. Service is average as they are understaffed and could be slow. But quality of food compensates the average service.
5
Food-
- Balanced south indian meal with arguably the best vada we have ever tasted.
Atmosphere -
- Right next to the busy MTR is this hidden gem.
- Laid back no frills no pretentious atmosphere.

All the dishes in the restaurant taste like home cooked food. Their Andhra meal is a must have on their menu. Their dosas are also highly recommended. Very friendly owners and good service.
5
It was good food to have and experience elegant and nice food service is good and you can try it once

excellent homely food, courteous service, reasonable rates (by SG standards). Ordered plain dosas and rasam rice. Very tasty and filling. Highlight was the filter coffee

Singapore is a place with unlimited variety of cuisines and tastes. Being vegetarian is by no means an impediment to finding a good restaurant. However, with good food also arrives attitude, arrogance and nonchalance. This review is the result of all that.My friend recommended this place given my vegetarian lifestyle and love for South Indian food. I would like to add that this review is from my second and final visit to this establishment. I have no complaints about the food - just about everything is moderately spiced, not very rich and like you'd eat at home, atleast mine. However, like most Indian restaurants, globally, it suffers from lack of service and infinite attitude like there's no other entity in the world that can satisfy one's desire for good food.After a rather chaotic 'Indian' line-up near the counter, my presence was acknowledged without trying to arrange a table (or atleast part of a table, as is customary in Singapore Indian restaurants). I took it upon myself to assign a table for myself. The ordering process was relatively simple and the food arrived. When asked for water (something that's basic in an Indian restaurant), a dirty cup showed up with imaginary contents from a water jug on the table. When the water finally showed up in a rather stained plastic jug, I had little desire to drink it. When ordering I had insisted on an 'unlimited' meal only to realize that 'unlimited' makes sense only when there's someone willing to serve it to you. The waiter (the lone male guy) brought out a container with vegetables and rattled the spoon inside signifying the absence of food (something that's very insulting to me in a restaurant or a home). After putting up with the delay, stained containers and lack of food, I had had enough. I decided to abandon the restaurant after tossing a 10$ bill on the counter to pay for food I didnt' consume. You may have guessed, I am not going there again, If you can put up with the symptoms and root faults listed above, this is a great place. I can't, and I won't.My only regret is that I wasted food and the lady (whom I presume to be the owner) reminded me as I left in a huff. However, there was enough of a scene created that I couldn't stay back and finish my food. The two ladies that run the place seem to be nice enough. If they can dispense with the mouthy waiter and hire some young help, this will be a place I'd recommend without hesitation

I have had food here during my various visits to Singapore , never disappointed.Homely south Indian food, welcomed with a warm smile. Observed all guests greeted with same warmth and greetings exchanged. South Indian Meals , Andra meals , Idly Manchurian & Mini sambhar idly are all must try
4
This place in Serangoon is an ideal place for vegetarians.The food is very tasty and the service extremely good.Iwas very impressed by the way the staff ensured that everyone was attended to promptly. Being situated next to MTR and Koalas they do face tough competition but I am sure if they attend to customers as they do now they will end up far ahead of others

I have visited this establishment many times over the last few years and the consistency of food, simplicity of employees/ management and the effort which they put in is amazing. Given the demand ( I assume ) they have now started serving dosa items around lunch time as well. But to us the simple South Indian meal and for the spicy palette the Andhra meal are highly recommended

If you are in Singapore and craving for a very good vegetarian meal, then nothing can beat this one!!I would give it a few hundred stars if there is an option. Yummy, delicious, sumptuous, and very affordable. It is not as expensive as those other branded restaurants like the one very next to it but it sure would outperform all these branded ones in terms of quality, purity, cleanliness, and hospitality.My all time favorite here would be regular south indian meals. What a Sambar, rasam, koottu, thogayal, kozhambu!!! It would surely bring you nostalgic moments if you are missing your mom's food for a long time. Today I have also tried Pongal, Rava dosai, and Kesari bath. Simply mouth watering. Name a variety and it would taste just awesome. More than the taste, it is the authentic taste that really satisfies your appetite and emotions. I am seriously shocked at how they manage to prepare every item with the same amount of elegance.Those two ladies that manage the restaurant - hats off to them!! They surely are blessed one
