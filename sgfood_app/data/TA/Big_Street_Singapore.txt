Our first visit to Big Street! We ordered two salted egg prata bom and two prata wrap (chill crab and curry chicken respectively). The salted egg prata bom is a must try, it's highly recommended!

My hotel was 4 blocks away and I was struggling for something for lunch as I had just got into town.
Stumbled upon Big Street and WOW!! The chicken satay wrap was outstanding!!
Can‚Äôt wait for tomorrow.....

Great food which are local favourites with a twist. Excellent beef rendang cubes with little pratas. Lovely dessert as well

Big Street is big for value. The food is decent though can be slightly pricey but you can enjoy Udders ice cream too at the same venue!

Atmosphere was great with movie screening as well

The food was average.
The service was slow. It was a Sunday evening with just a few tables but it took them ages to serve us our food.
The atmosphere was nice though.

If you like Prata this is a nice place to come. We had the prata coins and crab meat - personally the crab sauce was a bit sweet but we still enjoyed it. The hokkien mee was really good with large prawns and the didn‚Äôt stinge at all. Good place to come again.

 The restaurant is located in a 2-storey shopuhouse a stone‚Äôs throw from Jalan Besar MRT station. We were ushered to a table on the 2nd storey which felt more like a soccer themed bar/restaurant. Quite a wide selection of food/drinks. We had the chili crab which was good!

Visited Big Street on their journey experience package. Had a very fun time flipping prata, I think it was indeed an Eye opening experience to all of us as we didn‚Äôt imagine it would be that tough to prepare a prata. Though we actually made the prata from scratch, nothing was edible because the actual prata requires a 12h preparation and proper hygiene. This allowed us to better appreciate the thoughts and effort put into the prata we usually get from midnight supper places. Then we had the chance to hands on our very own Singapore sling, ofcoz we got cheeky and started doing our own versions of the sling with our orefdered proportions of the ingredients, but Big Street was cool about it. BRAVO! Lastly, the Thosai experience that made us realise it wasn‚Äôt as though as we think. Overall the entire dinner of 2h is excellent! Many singaporean dishes and hand Son experience with very well researched background and stories. The most surprising was at the last part where we were told that it was a certified halal establishment in terms of food handling and food supplies, they only couldn‚Äôt attain a halal certificate for their restaurant due to the sale of alcohol, meaning it‚Äôs very Muslim friendly actually !! WONDERFUL !! will definitely be back!

My company was looking for a venue to host dinner for foreign delegates. We got more than we expected at Big Street. We were recommended the ‚ÄúBig Street Experience‚Äù with dinner after. It was so much fun! Who would have thought a restaurant could provide a hands-on & informative experience. For dinner, Big Street serves an array of Singapore‚Äôs beloved dishes. We had Chilli Crab in a Prata Bag - talk about being innovative! There were also classics like Satay and Hokkien Noodles. Service was impeccable; staffs were warm, attentive and accommodating. Additionally they also have big screens & electronic dart machine. Totally recommend this restaurant for company‚Äôs dinner, team-building, hosting foreign friends or just hanging-out and chilling. Write to Erin, Restaurant Manager if you want to find out more about the ‚ÄúBig Street Experience‚Äù. Many thanks to all the staffs who have assisted the event last Wednesday!

Price was abit pricy as they are quite generous on the ingredient. The main dish was the crab in the prata bag. A bit disappointed with that as it does not taste as great. Just for the experience and photo taking...probably will not go again.

Family brunch it was. Kids had the chicken prata rolls - loved it. Mrs had the friend beehoon - left most of it. I had the Hokkien Mee - standard fare. Friend chicken wings were yumms. Satay ooookay. Maybe we didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t pick the best of the bunch. Will give the spot one more chance.

Super friendly Erin and her team serve plenty of local delights including the generous crab paratha. The satays were tasty as was the thick peanut sauce. Plenty of other food choices and craft beer too, so everyone will be happy. Bright clean setting and reasonable prices.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful

Our group was large ... 21 persons strong. However Erin of Big Street pulled off the evening smoothly. All the tables n setting were in place for the group. The menu was very unique and tantalizing to the sight and taste. We got to "play" with our food ... DIY thosai n pancake ... before the main courses were served. The Hokkien Mee was tasty with the accompanying chili . Then followed the surprise platter. To top it off we had the chili crab in a prata wrap ... a very creative spin to 2 of Singapore's favorites. Kudos to Big Street The 3-level premises of the restaurant itself is a gem. It is housed within an old building but well renovated n maintained within. The ambience within is quiet and cosy.

very nice and clean place. we had peppermint tea and the best hazelnut ice cream we have ever tasted. service was nice and we were given the opportunity to order directly to the kitchen by ipad which resulted in a prompt delivery of the food and beverages

Had lunch early this month and the food was great. The wife had Prata coins with chilli crab and it was so delicious. I had the Hokkien Noodles with Jumbo Prawns and is was also. The kids also enjoyed their meal. The place looks great especially the top floor. the only downside was that we had to wait 15-20 mins for a taxi as there was no taxi stand nearby so had to flagged one down. The good news is that there will be an MRT Station nearby so getting there and out of the area would be easy. Overall, .great foo

My family of 2 adults and 2 kids had dinner here last Saturday. It's housed in a rehabilitated pre-war shop house along Jalan Besar next to the to be opened Jalan Besar MRT station. Two-storeys of seating in an air-conditioned bistro-style setting. There is a bar on the upper floor and many TV screens screening movies. Dressing seems to be casual. It was not busy when we went on Saturday, so it was fairly relaxing. Whilst it aims to be bistro-style, more due to the decorations, don't expect tablecloths and fancy table settings, it's still very much Singaporean utilitarian. Service was friendly and efficient, and manager Erin checked in on us pretty frequently, and helped us with the electronic order pad. The menu has standard fare local street food like satay, prata (wide variety), chicken rice, hokkien mee, biriyani rice with chicken/mutton. If you want to try a bit of everything, order the mixed platter. We got the one with chicken biriyani, satay and coin prata. The prata was the best cooked dish, crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside ($4 and up). The kids loved the coin prata too ($6 for plain, $12-16 if you order it with a meat curry). The fish curry that came with the prata was generous in sauce and not too spicy. The Bom Prata a house specialty is cooked to order. It is a fusion of the Cantonese salted egg yolk filling but encased in prata skin. One cut and the golden goodness oozed out. You have to eat it quickly before it dribbles over the edges of the platter! There are healthy options available too like the healthy chicken rice, which cost significantly less than the standard chicken rice, but was a good sized serving nevertheless. They serve Udders ice-cream for dessert and some local desserts.Nice ambiance, friendly staff, decent food for a relaxing meal out

Quality food were served and it was one of the best salted egg prata. Food served looked the same as the menu! Serving was fast too! took about 5mins for Salted egg prata and Mao Shan Wang Prata to come. Nice and cosy environment. Definitely will come again

My friend and I went to Big Street to check out their coin pratas with chilli crab and salted egg prata after seeing a video on facebook.We cannot deny that the food are above our expectation. It is my very first time trying coin pratas. Their coin pratas are crispy yet fluffy and have a buttery fragrance. It do match with the chilli crab and its sauce. It is savory.The salted egg prata is more like a dessert. The salted egg lava flows out once we had our first cut on it. It is sweet and yummy.I will think that they are definitely worth a try, but not recommended to have it regularly as pratas are suppose to be a budget and economic hawker or coffee shop food

Place is super nice.

Staff are accommodating though not everyone can understand or speak English.

Nice cozy place for dinner and a quiet drink. Food is good and ambience is great. They serve local food like Hokkien mee, satay, Cha Kway Tiao etc. Wide variety of drinks and happy hour from 5 pm to 8 pm.

I have never tasted food that good and with such an excellent pricing tier for catering. The catered food was warm and nice. The food quality served was great and they provide a wide variety of cuisine to suite each and everyone's taste buds!

This is the place that makes roti prata into a great new local twist. So the prata is great - for example because they had the salted egg roti prata with the egg oozing out!!! So good!!!! a little bit of innovation makes the place great. they also have a games room on the top floor but that was more suitable for older kids and not younger kids - could have been done bette

Disorganized, confused, incompetent. Our drinks took more than 30 mins to be served, whereas food was over an hour!Some of the staff here don't seem to know where their cutlery and condiments are placed, or if they even have any at all -- we asked for toddler cutlery, but wasn't given and had to look for them ourselves and found some; even more baffling was how one waiter wasn't sure where they place their soy sauce.I don't remember having written any negative reviews for any place before. This experience at Big Street had compelled me to write this because it was really that bad. I reckon the overly positive reviews were either paid or sponsored.It's a shame because the food was actually OK. Sure, it was overpriced hawker food. But not to the point that I won't come back to try other dishes. The appalling service is what failed here. To the chef and kitchen crew -- your service crew really let you down

Went for lunch on a rainy Wednesday afternoon with colleagues. Arrived as separate groups as we were coming from different locations. The first group reached about 20 minutes before and started ordering drinks. Pretty sure the staff cleanly forgot about the order until the second group arrived and had to remind the staff twice. A thirty-minute wait for a bottle of root beer and a glass of mojito. Ridiculous, especially since the place was generally empty. Experience of ordering food from the ipad menu was pretty poor - difficult to find what we want when options were hidden within options and had to call the staff to help.The mushroom soup was basically cream, very much like taking a can of Campbell soup paste, heat it up, and serve. Nothing fanciful. The chilli crab coin prata set was very good though - can really taste the chilli crab. The salted egg prata leans more towards the semi-solid than what's usually in a salted egg bun. Not too shabby though.Generally, the air-conditioned atmosphere is quiet and the place is clean

Went there on the recommendation of a friend. The food was a fusion of Malay, Thai and local cooking styles and was delicious and plentiful. We met the very friendly and experienced chef and he happily explained what prata was. He also surprised us with a gift of one of his signature dishes, a big surprise and very tasty.Delicious food and very good value for money. Friendly staff and acceptable wait time. Highly recommended if you're coming tomSingapore

Went with family today to try the Prata. Decided to order half a dozen of chicken satay. All 6 sticks are burn when serve. We requested for it to be change. 15mins later they serve another plate of satay which look similar to the previous burn version. We asked the waiter if this is the same plate serve previously. Waiter went in to check and claim that they've accidentally serve us the initial burn satay. Hence, another 15mins of wait and the final replacement was acceptable. No problem with the service but restaurant wasn't crowded. However, honesty would be the best policy to ensure a successful business in long run.

Most waitress were unable to comprehend English . They waitress were foreign workers . They have to seek assistance each time we order and ask for something . Waiting for the Prata were fast. However, the waiting for the main dishes were very long . After a close to 40 minute wait for chicken rice , we Inquire and they replied saying that the food will be out soon ! Close to 15 min later , we told them that we do not want the food as the wait was too long and we had finished our drink . Then the waitress suddenly went into the kitchen and brought out the Chicken rice , it was apparent that the food was ready , but it was not brought out to us . We said no and proceeded to the cashier . The waitress told the cashier not to charge us for the chicken rice as we didn't consume it . But guess what ? Cashier wanted my husband to pay without letting us go through the bill . Husband requested for the detailed bill and saw that the chicken rice was in the bill itself

The place is very well decorated. Air conditioned, toilet is clean, service is top quality. The food is of the fine dining side, you can find the same prata across the street for 50-70% of the price.This place sells atmosphere and services.Tried the salted egg prata and teh for $10 dollars, it was tasty. The prata and teh is as delicious as the ones I have across the street for $4
