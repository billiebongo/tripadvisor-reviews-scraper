Attracted by the interior vintage design and decided to pay a visit there. Tried the avocado expresso drink and tasted very nice. Food wise is average, desserts is good. Suitable for a group of friends's gathering and chit chatting at this cosy environment.

I like the environment. Staff is friendly and food is good quality given the low prices. Juices are great there. Give it a try if you are nearby

I chanced upon the cafe while arranging a dinner get-together. It was a jewel of a find because this place is authentically decorated with old memories of Singapore with innovative food to boost. The owner and staff were very friendly and prompt in their service. The avocado coffee, the french grilled chicken and the ondeh ondeh coconut cake are must tries
5
It's a good place to have dinner. In a casual way ! The staff is so nice you fell home. I miss the pasta with beef cheek. It was so good... full chicken is a given. Try it , I am sure you'll come back there !

1st time visitors would not believe from the facade that it is a restaurant. The furniture is quirky, recycled and brings a smile reach time I visit. The food is very good. They experiment with cakes and the finished ones are always very unique and complete, not like some places where the cakes are sourced from factories, mass produced and always lacking something.
5
I used to go there a lot when I lived closer. Good value for money. Good food, big and good deserts. The wine selection is also good and honest price. The decoration of the place is great. The owners are very nice and service is top. It is always a pelasure to have dinner there.

Great decor with antique furnishing and toys. Does bring back memories of 'old' days where i last saw in grandma's place. Had the big breakfast and smoked salmon guacamole sandwich. The guacamole was exceptionally tasty and surprisingly goes very well with the smoked salmon. The sandwich also comes with a side salad : zesty sour based dressing. Taste great but would have been better with a bigger portions. Cuppacino and mocha is below average I'd say.... Cuppacino was flat and the mocha was bland , milk without much hint of coffee nor chocolate. In the expensive side of scale, but wiill be back for the food though if happen to be in the neighbourhood.

Located at 111 King George Avenue, the cafe interior is nostalgic yet its menu surprised you with new creation dishes.The drinks are served in reshaped vodka bottles and you must try their Avocado Coffee. The chilled creamy avocado is served with a shot of warm espresso. You can either drink it separately or pour the espresso in it. An ideal place to spend the afternoon for its alfresco dining.

The setting is rather unique and the food is not too bad. Sadly, they got some really unhappy staffs about the management. It was pretty awkward for the patrons as we can clearly hear their ranting conversation on over long working hours... perhaps the management can look into it. After all, happy staff makes happy food and gives pleasant customer experiences

Aeiou is quite conveniently located but due to its inconspicuous frontage it is not at all obvious for first-line visitors. Was there for breakfast twice now. I thought the menu may seem common but the food was very well prepared and tasty, much better than some other places (serving similiar food at about the same costs, if not pricier) that I have tried so far. The place is cosy and exudes character. Do check it out

Take Exit B from Lavender MRT Station followed by a 5 mins walk. Good portions are big and priced reasonably. The avocado coffee is a must try. A great place for meals or coffee with friends and family.
5
Nice food and friendly service. Tried truffle cut fries and portobello burger. Good try indeed. Will be back to try more of their menu. Portion is big.. Don't over order.. üëç

We found this place through the cafe sg guide purchased recently at the Coffee Festival. Great find - love the decor, great coffee, yummy brunch

This a very cool place with interesting decor based around the theme of love. There's food service and a good selection of cakes too. The avocado coffee is great and addictive !!

AEIOU was a rustic, vintage and charming small cafe located in King George's Avenue area, less than 10 minutes walk from Lavender MRT station. The cafe that used to be an antique shop was very easy to spot because the cafe was the only colourful venue surrounded by grey concrete buildings.The interior definitely had the eclectic vibe through a lot of mix and match furniture that co-exist peacefully in one site. Vintage crockery, antique lamp and a lot of green plants could be seen throughout the wall of the cafe. The avocado coffee served in re-purposed Vodka glass was so yummy. There were different ways to drink it such as pouring the whole shot into the glass. I decided to enjoy the avocado milk shake by itself then pouring the whole shot into it which resulted in a perfect concoction, yum! I haven't had a glass of avocado coffee for a very long time since I moved to Perth 16 years ago.We also ordered a slice of NY Cheese Cake with rich dense consistency while creamy at the same time. I think I'm on a mission to find a good NY Cheese Cake in Perth now! The cheese cake was quite filling though so I had to share it with hubby even though I planned to finish it by myself...So, why AEIOU? The concept behind it was because we need to be reminded to go back to basic and nature. The alphabets A, E, I, O, U were the very first vowel that we all learnt when we were little. On the side note, I saw a young man paid for his mum's meal secretly that day because it was his special date with his mum. What a great reminder of how love should be :-)

I love the nostalgic, artsy and very individual style of this place - refreshing to see this in Singapore. The staff and service was very friendly and fast. Their menu is nicely done and it's easy to find something for everybody. Good variety. The quality of the dishes was good but nothing memorable (my avocado/ salmon sandwich was super cold - salmon felt frozen). But their presentation of all lunch dishes our party had, were very nice.I'll come back another time to test the quality of the food. Definitely a great place to have coffee and chill

My friend and I visited AEIOU this afternoon having heard a lot about the cafe and its signature avocado coffee.Upon arrival, we were quickly shown to a little blue table at the back of the premise. The cafe was an antique shop transformed into a hipster cafe. The owners kept the integrity of the shop exterior and added their quirk to the interior of the premise. The result, to me, was a hodgepodge of ideas and things that didn't quite belong together and that were neither vintage nor charming.However, I was there for coffee, not to impart my non-existent interior design knowledge on anyone.The back of the shop smelt musty and a bit funny, of something I couldn't put my finger on... a bit like an old warehouse.We were promptly given the food and drinks menu by our server. The menu was pieces of paper on a clipboard, which looked like it needed replacing; paper was old, stained, and dogeared. Not very appetising.We ordered an avocado coffee and the Irish cream coffee. I remembered seeing pictures of the avocado coffee served deconstructed (hipster alert!), so I asked for my coffee to be poured into the avocado puree/mixture. The avocado coffee was a great idea. It was smooth and thick, almost like a milkshake, minus the calories (hopefully!). I also liked how it was served in repurposed vodka bottles. Big green tick for being environmentally considerate. The only drawback was the coffee. The roast was just... ordinary. If they had used better beans, it would make the avocado coffee even better.The Irish cream coffee was bland bland bland. The coffee tasted of nothing. We could hardly taste the Irish cream. It was a disappointing glass of iced coffee.We did not order food and therefore could not comment on it, although we were put off by the prices on the menu. We were shocked to find ordinary things such as mushroom soup and some eggs and brioche costing an arm and a leg! Fortunately, service charge and GST were included in the price.All in all, I would probably go back only for the avocado coffee, although I can probably make a better tasting glass using my Nespresso if I can be bothered

AEIOU located in an area of warehouses near Jalan Besar stadium is a great and fun place to have dinner or just a drink. The place is a former antique shop, and the inside still looks like one. Food is quite original and elaborated but at the same time it has feels like going out of your mum's kitchen. I love the roots fries and the beef cheek pasta is great. One of our faves are the stuffed mushrooms.The place has a nice drink list with with surprising mocktails, but also a choice of beers and a nice wine list. The choice of desserts if also very interesting.Served with friendly staff Aeiou is a warm and friendly place for family diner

Tucked in the corner of a light industrial area on King George√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Avenue is a cafe decked out in the most hipsterish manner possible. AEIOU cafe features decorations that screams to be photographed. Literally. Every. Single. Corner. Snap-worthy. I have to literally filter tonnes of photos from this place to just the essential 3. When my group was there on a Saturday morning, it was already busy with people, so kinda of an interesting place to people watch too
4
Tucked away in the industrial areas just a few mins walk from Lavender MRT station, easily identifiable from a distance. Love love love the decoration inside its so quaint and love the food even more.. Must order - avocado coffee and duck confit. Great for couples, group of friends for a nice afternoon brunch..
5
Great food, ambience, service!
Very good beef cheek pasta, duck confit.
Must have mushroom soup for starter and carrot cake for dessert, best I've ever tasted üëç.
5
The decorations from this cafe are excellent, which really helped create a quirky atmosphere for a unique dining experience. The food was excellent, especially their tortellini. Their service is excellent and most of the food came quickly.
5
Very unusual and eclectic place where each piece of interior is carefully selected and tells a story. Great food, especially tenderloin in pastry. A must visit place!
4
I love the quirky decor and friendly staff. Great place for small groups to hang out.
Highly recommend the avocado coffee, generous salads, roast chicken and duck confit. Don't forget to have the tiramisu as well.

We've eaten dinner here regularly since they opened - fun, retro decor in the hardware store area of jalan besar, just 5 minutes walk from Lavender MRT. We always share one of their whole roast chickens - served with roasted veg and gravy - delicious. The chicken takes 20 minutes to prepare so time for a kale and pumpkin salad first.Or during the day, great to sit outside with icy grapefruit and pomegranate drink - the avocado coffee sounds like a strange combination but worth a try.Service has improved from the early days and staff are all friendly and helpful
5
We had a gread dinner at aeiou. The place looks nice, service was good and food was excellent. I usually like to eat local food, but this didn't feel like too far from local (seems to be French...). Hightly recommended place to go while in Singapore :)The place has nice house vine and all kind of cool stuff at their stor
4
What an lovely and quirky place with gorgeus food and friendly and professionall staff!I really loved the decor of the place, very original. If you like art work made out of scrap metal this is your place, you can buy some handmade artworks and jewellry aswell.Pls note, the place doesnt have a prober sign on the road, look for a sign that looks like a dinosaur or Antiques shop.

This quaint and funky cafe has a wide menu that offers both healthy and hearty meals. However, we were seated in the big table that's tucked away in one corner so we had a hard time calling the attention of the staff. There were only two of them during that lunch hour, though. The French roasted chicken and veggie wraps were very good. The food was served pretty fast except for the sea bass, which we had to follow up. The avocado coffee was interesting and tasted great! Enjoyed our lunch here
5
this place is perfect for those wanting to enjoy healthy whole food. A great menu with a great quality ingredients. This is a healthy eaters hot spot and even if you arent a health freak it is great, The staff are great and the owner came over to ask our opinion. Its a must if you are dinning in Singapore

Very cosy & nicely done up decor cafe. However it can be inconvenience if you don't drive. Food & service are equally awesome! An awesome place to hang out with a few close friend for some catch up and foodie time! :) Oh yes! Pls try their avocado coffee.. it's realllyyyyyyy awesome!!!!
2
Looks cool but menu and food quality could be improved. We wanted breakfast and chose the eggs - a frying pan with four eggs....
Avocado coffee is the highlight but the expensive price tag doesn't justify a return.
4
The food there are served in big portion also it a great place to have pictures taken as many olden days stuff there. However, variety of food is little.
5
We visited this place for brunch today. Food delicious and well priced, great coffee, excellent service and fantastic ambience. We'll be coming back for sure.

and have a very good service too.
will be back again ,

For lunch on Saturday had the half siracha chicken and the avocado coffee smoothie. Both superb. Chicken was so moist and spiced perfectly came with a little salad on side. Not too greasy . The smoothy was the star of the meal ! Never had anything like the smoothy I was weirded out by the sound of it but then I begged for the recipe after my first sip. The atmosphere is so cheery with Brazilian music and funky decor. Big bright airy space it was needed cool down from Singapore heat and humidity. The staff was lovely and even gave me travel tips.

AEIOU doesn't look at all like a restaurant from the outside. It keeps the look of the original shop in it's hay day - old school shutters and glass doors at the entrance -and masks itself as an antique shop but it actually is mostly a restaurant serving French and fusion food.The interior is beautifully done up, with pretty lights and toys lining up the ceiling and walls. They sell some of the antique items strewn along the shelves and bar top.The tables and chairs look vintage and even our baby chair was vintage looking!We ordered Sriracha Chicken set meal and an Avocado Guacamole Sandwich set meal. Each set meal comes with a soup, of which we chose the Clam Chowder. The chicken was undercooked and I sent it back. It took about 10 minutes before it was returned, with no apologies. However, the Sriracha sauce made all the difference to the dish.We also had a hazelnut crunchy cake which lacked the crunch. It should have been called a hazelnut mousse cake instead.However, the must have was the Iced Avocado Coffee. The avocado was heavenly!The corner that we sat at was stuffy and had a stale musky smell, which didn't help the whole experience.1) Come here,2) take some photos & tag @aeioulife,3) have their famous Iced Avocado Coffee,4) design one of their cartons,5) tell your friends about it.Meanwhile, I hope they cook better. This place has got potential

AEIOU is of walking distance from Lavender MRT, ordered Duck confit, beef cheeks pasta and Seabass to share and I must say duck confit is my favourite of all! Skin is so crispy and the duck meat is tender and easy to pull off the bone. The accompanying side that came along with it was delicious too. Do order the Avocado coffee to try as well.
5
Staff always friendly and attentive. Excellent menu and haven't ever been disappointed with a dish. I usually go for the 1/2 chicken as a main and have tried most of the appetizers and Pasta dishes. Highly recommended. Pleasant atmosphere has been getting more popular Iv noticed in the last few months. One of the many hidden cafes and restaurants in lavender but easily the best.
5
This cafe is located in an industrial neighborhood, with an old antique shop exterior. The exterior decor of the cafe and lights add colors to the neighborhood. They provide a wide drinks and dessert selection. Appetizers and main course selection makes a good selection of cafe food

A nice, cosy place tucked away in the Lavender MRT neighborhood.The cafe's entrance is not very visible, it is at the corner of the block, take a look at the pictures I've taken and you will be able to locate easily. 3 simple tips...1. Go for the Roasted chicken, it has plenty of herbs in its belly. Very tender even for the breast portion. If you are not hungry, go for the half portion.2. The soups , both the Mushroom and Seafood Chowder, are great. The hot buns are simply delicious! Ask for the complimentay butter to go along with the buns.3. The special coffee, called Avocado Coffee, is simply amazing, especially when I compare it with Starbucks Coffee. Find the 3 tips helpful? Please click "Helpful
