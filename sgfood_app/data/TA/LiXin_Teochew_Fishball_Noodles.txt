quite a standard fishball noodle stall.
portions were quite tiny.
seasoning was good though (salty).

Bouncy fish balls bouncy and fish dumpling is fresh. Flavoursome noodle. Efficient service. Will definitely return for more.

It felt like a upscale hawker store in a mall. Don't expect too much as it is not a restaurant. Good is so so only.

Tried the chilly fishball as a quick snack while waiting for my daughter and it was the best I have ever tried!The sauce full of flavor, it has a hint of spiciness perfectly balanced with pork lard and black vinegar to give you a perfect blend of spicy, acid & sweetness. Once I was done, I was longing for more and decided to order another potion for home. I highly recommend this place
