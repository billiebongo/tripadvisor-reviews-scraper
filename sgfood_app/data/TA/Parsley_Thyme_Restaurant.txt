Pricing for the food was good but when you order fish and it comes out half raw. That is not good!
There is a reason some restaurant strives and others fail..

Must try their onion soup!!! We had a one for one voucher, so we decided to try their steaks. They didn't dissapoint. It was cooked to perfection and taste absolutely amazing. I think that was the most enjoyable dinner I had so far.

Cosy restaurant nestled in the outram neighborhood that serves one of the best lambshank and beef cheek stew in town! The meat is super tender, with the right amount of fat that melts in your mouth! Their onion soup is a Must-Try! Although tad too sweet to my liking, I have no regrets trying this generous, scrumptious soup. If you're craving for French food with reasonable price, Parsley and Thyme is the place for you!Ps: if you're the owner of P&Thyme, add bread basket as a starter would beCosy restaurant nestled in the outram neighborhood that serves one of the best lambshank and beef cheek stew in town!
