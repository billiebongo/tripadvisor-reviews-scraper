I was jet lagged and confused when I arrived and the gentleman that served me was kind and explained what was what. The food came and was well priced and portioned.

Great selection of salmon, beef and chicken dishes that cooks on your own hotplate. Comes with pepper rice and adding like green beans, sprouts, corn, mashed potato.

Been there for lunch and had service was good. The food can be served hot. The drinks need better preparation

The food was ok. Not so great but no harm trying the place if you are around in this area. Went there with family and didnt really regret it.

Love this place, had been originally in another area but really enjoy it, something different and also not badly priced. Stays really hot on the hotplate

As the address was at Victoria street, so we just out from the Bugis Junction. After walk away, we just found and realized that it just at the food junction the 3rd floor. The rice was okay.

The beef slide and hamburger patty was good. The steam rice and soup that came with the set was so so (Japanese mixed rice and miso soup is too salty). But for the price paid 8.8S$ couldn't complain much.

This is a fast food restaurant in malls in Singapore and Bangkok. The meat cooks in the hot plate as you are eating it. The rice is tasty and can become crispy if you dont eat too fast. Great for lunch inexpensive good portions and good choices of meat

Pepper Lunch express is a fast food restaurant serving cuts of meat or fish with different sauces and rice in a cast iron sizzling pot. The food is of decent quality, tasty and good value for eating out in Singapore if you fancy a change from the hawker fare.

I may need courage to eat in Pepper Lunch again in the future. I was having Salmon Pepper Rice (I love it!) and root beer for lunch. And was made to change table while I still have half root beer left. The staff asked twice to hurry me because I was eating my ice cream too slowly. Soon realised that she wanted me to give up my table so that the customer next to me can have mine for her family of five. But I haven't finish my drink yet! I felt so discriminated just because I was eating alone

Visited a Peppered Lunch in Singapore as I have tried a branch in Hong Kong, very similar but I am sure that the meat they use is different and of a lower quality here in Singapore!??
Everything else tasted the same!

Amazing choices and good simple food. Tried their salmon and chicken lunch. Only if their salmon pieces were a bit more decent would have been better. Nevertheless the concept is awesome.
Great for a quick bite.
Loved it !

I loooooved going to Pepper Lunch while living in Japan so imagine my excitement when two years later I finally reunite with it again in Singapore! It was the same as always, cheap, quick, and absolutely addicting. :D
P.S. I got the Beef Pepper Rice.

It's like the perfect dish for the lowest price! Had the angus beef pepper rice and it was just incredibly tasty. The quality of the beef, the seasoning, the sauces, the combo with the rice & corn.. It's just genious! And the greatest part is, it's only 6-8 SGD!!! Unseen, came back again the day after! Thank you Pepper Lunch!!

Pepper Lunch Express is easy on the pocket but big on taste. In fact, my family has Pepper Lunch meals every Saturday because my husband says it is a safe bet to keep us happily fed! Pepper Lunch Express can be found in many foodcourts around Singapore, but the quality and quantity remain consistently good. We love the Salmon, Chicken or Beef with rice. These taste delicious even when eaten at home as a take-away. But needless to say, it's best to eat your Pepper Lunch meal piping hot on the grill plate as soon as it's cooked

We are always on a budget when we go out for leisure. and this suited our requirement. We also have this in the Philppines but I never tried it there. I was amused the price is almost the same here and in the Philippines.The kids loved the beef pepper lunch so much
4
Was in the mood for something simple and "safe" after a few days of spicy asian food. The beef pepper rice fit my craving to a t with the simple clean flavors and black pepper. The food was served in a hot cast iron pan which added to the fun (and kept the food slightly too hot for fast eating)

If you're a steak lover like me and you are budget conscious, then Pepper Lunch Express is your destination in Singapore. They have all kinds of food ranging from Salmon and Chicken, Sliced Beef, Pasta, Curry and of course, Beef Steak.Great food at great value. We have been regular customers for many years now

We visited pepper lunch express at orchid road and also raffles city. $6.80 you get a sizzling hot plate with rice, corn and beef (or salmon) and pepper. You also get a soup and sauces to drizzle on. For $2 extra you can have extra meat. We loved it. Such a flavour some, affordable and fulfilling meal. I'd strongly recommend this place. I wish we had it back at home.
