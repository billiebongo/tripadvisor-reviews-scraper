A very nice relaxing chill place for social dining. Would recommend their pizzas ! Food is value for money with entertainer.

Food and service was good. But the place is run-down with no air-con although it is just newly opened.

Tucked in a corner of rochester park, the cafe was surprisingly nice. Food is good. It can be used for a private gathering and party as well. Gives a cosy feel to it.

Quiet cafe in the middle of Rochester park. Great for catching up with friends to talk for hours without worrying about the crowds and noise.

We used the Entertainer app so that made it very value for money! The beef dish is super tender and melts in mouth. Duck confit was smaller than expected. Pizza were good for sharing

The cafe is great for couples or a small group of friends gathering as it is tucked in a quiet stretch of Rochester Road.

My party of 3 had a rather enjoyable time with the meal and had no problems with the service provided by the young waitress. Prior to ordering, I had already indicated to the waitress that I wished to utilize a pre-purchased Chope voucher and she said I could pass the printed hard copy of the voucher with the redemption code to her upon payment. However, when the time came to pay the bill, the manager of the restaurant insisted that I had to show him my Chope voucher on the Chope app on my handphone in order to redeem it. Despite repeated explanations that I have dined at many other restaurants previously and had no issues with just presenting the hard copy of the Chope voucher to settle payment, he was adamant that ALL his previous customers who used Chope ONLY redeemed vouchers via the app and he has never accepted any other modes of voucher presentation. The conversation got heated and he even threatened to not accept the voucher at all.It was only after I got home when I called the restaurant back that he admitted he had clarified with his Chope representative that I was right and offered an apology. Nonetheless, this whole debacle left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and I will definitely not be returning

The place was located at the end of the road, with a small alfresco dining area. Although it was non aircon, the place was cooling and relaxing. For a weekday, the place enjoyed a healthy flow of crowd.For weekday, the restaurant was having a S$12++ lunch set which consisted of a choice of pasta/ pizza/ salad/ soup/ sandwich and a choice of soft drink. Sausage Linguine Aglio e OlioLinguini cooked with chorizo & broccoli, flavoured with chilli padi & garlic Slightly peppery even after the exclusion of chilli pad

As above, food was rather pricey given the portion and quality, was lucky i was using a voucher instead. Location wise was pretty hard to find and it was outdoors only (lucky it was rather cooling). Service staff was friendly but wasnâ€™t aware of ongoing promotions.

Wanted to check out a dining place at One Rochester and decided to go with Thyme. I had no prior knowledge that it was all Alfresco setting and that the place was rather 'tiny'. The walk into One Rochester was pleasant as the weather was cloudy and windy. My bestie and I had a great lunch as we were the only patrons!I'd asked the solo floor staff for recommendations and decided to heed her advice, so we ordered the beef cheeks and pan friend salmon.Full praises for the beef cheeks. Salmon was a tad underwhelming. I just wished it was less bland and boring. I've made better salmon that that.I can only imagine how the weather might be bothersome but I'd thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Thyme on my visit last week! Would love to visit again in the evening to see how it looks

Simple menu, nice beef cheek reduction. Small place but definitely cosy especially with my wife. It’s like a hidden gem amidst the neighbourhood estates.

Food is nice. Venue is kinda small and a lil stuffy on a hot noon. Took quite a bit of time before food is served although there is not much crowd.

Very relaxing way to host a business lunch. Excellent value and friendly service. We both had enjoyable pasta dishes. Will definitely visit again.

Quiet restaurant nestled in Rochester park serving good food. Great place for cooling nights as there's no aircon/indoor seating.

We had the smoked duck pizza, which was savoury and good! The chicken leg confit was on the smaller side but also tasty. It was worth it with the 1-for-1 entertainer app!

Atmosphere was decent, food was cooked pretty professionally.I had the beef cheek which tasted fresh and juicy, while my friend had the salmon which tasted just like the average baked salmon you can make from home. Definitely would recommend going earlier for the one for one happy hour deals

We have tasted various European dishes and none of them convinced me, none of them was REALLY European.The vegetables were the same for all the dishes and very oily and bland.The food did not come in the right order. If I would have not been invited by a friend I would have complained.I would not recommend this place unless they seriously work on their food

Loved the natural, rustic atmosphere - a good and refreshing step away from air-conditioning for a change. A good place tucked in a nifty corner. Excellent for nature lovers.Food is quite good too. Fries and wedges were cooked-to-order so its not soggy. Our food was fresh and expertly prepared!Recommended for anyone who wants to step away from an office to breathe some fresh air and enjoy lunch at the same time.Just remember to bring an umbrella

If you don't intend to drive or Grab, Thyme is pretty inaccessible. But if you do decide to make the trip down, a quaint and alfresco-style restaurant awaits. Brunch lovers will certainly love their brunch menu, which is available only on weekends and public holidays. The food was delectable and their service was certainly top-notch. Be warned, however, that mosquitoes lurk in the restaurant (there were mosquito coils around but applying some repellent before you enter the restaurant might be a sensible choice)

All the food tasted like they were prepared from frozen state. The meatballs was ok, pizza dough was still hard and tasted 'frozen', pull pork sandwich was cold, the house burger was overcooked, very messy assembly, the beer was not fresh. We rejected after one sip but the boss insisted that it was ok to him as long it is opened within 7 days. He said that it was up to personal preference. I didn't think any beer drinker will like a stale beer that is not bubbling anymore and taste flat. I don't think I will go back there.
