Came here for lunch. Tried few bento and also sushi. Almost all dishes that we ordered we like it. The fish very fresh and the bento is very reasonable price.

I've been here several times, always on Omakase to save some brain power. Sea food is fresh, 3-4 times air delivery from Japan weekly, which is okay since you have high chance hitting a lucky day.Courses are all genuine, the chefs spend time and effort in preparing. There were also several dishes I encountered which were creative and brought me some surprise. Standard is always well maintained. Service is great, chefs would love to hat with you if you sit at the bar. I agree some would give four stars since it's a bit expensive. But subject to my own affection and pleasant conversations with the chefs, I upgrade it to five. Maybe a bit expensive, but for sure you left there with good mood, full stomach and satisfied tongue. Why not

Needed to bring some colleagues out for lunch, and we headed to this restaurant which is near our office. They have set lunches available, and we each picked what we liked. I chose the Bara Chirashi Teishoku. This is the mixed vegetables and seafood rice bowl set. It costs $18.The set lunch for the Chirashi seafood bowl came with chawanmushi, a fresh salad bowl, miso soup. I was expecting sashimi trimmings from leftover fish. But I saw sashimi fish that were freshly sliced and placed atop the rice. There was also tamago and Japanese cucumbers in it.It filled me up nicely for lunch. Good value for the quality and amount of food

Was there for lunch on a Saturday.- Bara Chirashi set $18 : Not tasty, though the chawanmushi was smooth and nice.- Sashimi set $22 : Only a few thinly slices of sashimi, but the kani tofu that was included in the set was a bonus.- Kani tofu $6 : must try - Niku Gagura sauce (grilled beef with goose liver sauce) $35 - not bad, pricey for the small portion

First timer, was there to celebrate the wife's birthday. The sashimi was good. The tempura prawn was not up to standard. Good collection of sake. A little pricey but it all depends what you order. The set dinner was reasonable. Our bill came to just over S$200. Will definitely return for another meal.

I went to the restaurant on 12th May 2015. We ordered a couple of the side dishes, main dish and a set meal. I cant remember the name of the dish which comes with beef and goose liver .. Very nice and tasty. The beef was very juicy and tender. The goose liver was also tender and cook just nice ... not raw and not too cook. I really enjoy it very much. All the side dishes were wonderful. I will definitely come back again and I also realise you have a good wide range of sake.. Will definitely come back and enjoy it

This was one of the best Japanese dinner we have had for a long while.One of the best option is to advise the waitress of what you wish to spend per head and the chef would then serve up a dinner to suit your budget. We had a superb 7 course meal for around Â£40 per head.The ambiance was great especially as we were dining outside on the terrace instead of inside in the air-conditioned restaurant.All in all, a great dining experience- brilliant food with excellent service.I would definitely come back- highly recommended

Went there yesterday for the 1st time invited by a friend who knows the owner. Chef John and his team did a great job as food was really good , impecable service and good value for money. Food came fast showing a well rounded team in the kitchen. The rolls were really good and the tuna sushi was amazing as rice had the proper warm temperature which is hard to find in sushi restaurants here. They also have various OMAKASE style prices to choose from so the chefs can give you the best they have that day. Sure going back for more

We were a party of five dining at Fukuichi for the first time. The chirashi sushi and negiritoro dons we ordered had very small servings of fish. We dine out at a lot at several japanese restaurants and were disappointed by the portion size. We also ordered 2 other cooked food lunch sets which were adequate. Although the price of each meal we ordered was reasonable, we will not return to this restaurant. Three of us who ordered two each of the chirashi sushis and negiritoro dons amongst us left feeling hungryish

The 3 layer sushi taste great and so is the Chawanmushi. The tempura soft shell crab and almond prawns not so great. The almond prawns taste very oily, an almond meal batter will probably be better.

Had set lunch and service was excellent! Food is quite decent and not pricy. Tried their salmon set. Will come back for more!

We went to Fukuichi with a friend and didn't look at the TripAdvisor beforehand, but we think it's a great sushi place with awesome rolls. Try the beef roll, best thing I ever had, even though it's not the typical sushi. Also, the layered roll was incredible! The staff is friendly, ambience really nice (even outdoor seating) and it's quite conveniently located. Only downside is the prices and we don't really know how it compares to other sushi places in that price category.

Was there for dinner on a Friday evening with a couple of friends. We ordered a variety of dishes to share and the portions were pretty generous. The beef and sushi rolls and chirashi don were our top picks. The cod fish was also really well executed. Will try the salmon aburi next time, could smell the aroma from the chefs counter but was too full to order more food for the evening

We tried getting reservations for a weekend dinner but they were fully booked so we tried walked-in and managed to get counter seat which was perfect since thats the best seats in the house when it comes to japanese dining. Service was a little slow for taking orders even though we came before the dinner crowd. We didnt see much unagi on th menu and asked if we could order it as a piece by itself. There was a bit of disarry as this request being was clarified. Apparently there is a set for this which wasnt in the menu, 2 whole pieces with a set at around $35 If i remember correctly. Extremely value for money as it was two huge thick pieces that came with rice, salad, miso sup and ice cream dessert. My favorite here is the Kani salad which is a small chilled dish of crabsticks hidden in a firm tofu ball that is covered in a century egg dressing and topped with chives. Fantastic flavours and great way to start a meal. The Sake aburi maki and also softshell crabs were good but didnt stand out much. Their cawamushi comes in a wide claypot rather than the usual cup types. We were only here for a light dinner so we skipped the sashimi but I've tried them before and the cuts are chilled, firm and thick. My peach ice cream was an absolute delight not for its taste but for its esthetic value. Peach ice cream covered in coloured chocolate to resemble the real thing with leaf included. A little surprice awaits within when u find the core pit to be made of a ferrero rocher. There was a little bowl in the corner atop the sashimi counter filled with tiny red brown crabs quite similar to fiddler crabs seen at mangrove areas but these had both equal sized claws. Found them amusing and wondered if it were part of the deco but later found out they were deep fried as a dish! Fukuichi is pretty decent but needs something a little more to stand out among the many jap eats popping up in Singapore

If Sushi Tei is the best of the worst, Fukuichi will be the worst of the best.Great service with a nice chillout bar but food wise, pricey yet average. A bento cost about S$40, with decent selection of sushi and sashimi. The only problem is the quality, nothing impressive or made any impact for a revisit. The much-raved about beef with goose liver sauce is not worth the try, same to most of the dishes we had. Out of 10 guests, none of us actually have good reviews about the food

In the relatively quiet shopping centre, Triple One on the second floor is a delightful Japanese restaurant with a decent selection of sushi rolls. Spider maki, shake aburi maki, uramaki and the unusual beef maki are recommended.The ocha had a smoked fragrance. The set meals are well constructed - I enjoyed the seabream mentaiko set.We were surprised with a lovely small serving of dessert at the end of our meal - a perfectly sized mango ice-cream mocha

Having been to Fukuichi Japanese Restaurant twice before (read about it here), the craving for their food just doesn't leave meService remains attentive and excellent, and ambience is still the same - quiet, exquisite and serene. I had my much-craved Cold Crabmeat Tofu - a very delicious and rich blend of crab-tofu served with a thick layering of mashed century egg, spring onions and scallions on top. The flavor is buttery, flavorful and refreshing.Next, the Cold Fish Noodles - something I had ordered by mistake. It somewhat slipped my mind that usually I ate the Hot Fish Noodles (the soup is fabulous), but this was one of their signatures as well, and it sure didn't disappoint. The noodles were springy with good texture that was not too hard nor soggy, and because it is made entirely of fish flesh, there was a tinge of sweetness to it. Dipped with the cold dark sauce that it is served with, this dish leaves one desiring for more.The next item I had was the Salmon Sashimi - slices of thick, fresh and sweet raw salmon that does not lose its bouncy texture.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/dinner-at-fukuichi-japanese-restaurant.htm

Have you ever discovered a simple-looking restaurant by chance, tried the food, and gotten addicted to one or more of the dishes? Well, it happened to me, when I chanced upon Fukuchi Japanese Dining with my buddy Cain*.This restaurant boosts of a traditional Japanese interior; quiet and serene ambience, ideal for business lunches or friends' gathering. The simple decorations are easy on the eyes, and comforting to the soul. Yes, they have VIP / private rooms and alfresco dining too, if one pleases.First we had the Crab Roe Tofu - which was a cold dish. The crab roe was superb - delicious and melts-in-your-mouth. Set against the very lightly-flavored tofu (beancurd), they complement each other greatly; both smooth, both mouthwatering on its own.The next item was a Cold Fish Noodle - what is so unique about this dish is that the noodles themselves are made of fish meat! Yes, not flour, wheat or starch - but fish flesh! It was ultra springy in texture, and the taste was just heavenly. It was literally love at first bite for Cain* and I. Since then, I have been having craving for this, and actually came back one more time to satiate my craving. This was truly one of the tastiest noodle dishes I had ever eaten, and the soup was nicely flavored with seaweed and hints of ....fish essence?For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/dinner-at-fukuchi-japanese-dining.htm

My two friends and I had alot of food - chirashi zushi(assortment of raw seafood and pickles over rice), yaki mentaiko (spicy cod roe wrap with cucumber), gyuniku kimo yaki (beef with foie gras), sake aburi maki (resembles california maki), nasu deguka (freshly grilled ggplant with miso).We did not have the bento set. Food was delicious and considering the quantity and quality of food, it's not considered expensive at $47 per person. If u don't order the gyuniku kimo yaki, it will cost less
