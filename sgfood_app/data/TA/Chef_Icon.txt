We went to this lovely small boutique vegetarian bakery yesterday for a lunchtime bite. The Max Ham & Cheese Burger and Homemade Sambal & Ham Sandwich we’re very delicious, the latter being both a little spicy and tangy. The vegetarian Ham is amazing both in taste and texture and it’s difficult to believe that it’s not real Ham. The Cheese & Cranberries Tart was also very tasty. The Americano coffee though was average. We had also ordered a 1/2kg Pure Chocolate Black Forest Trovana cake a few days ago from this bakery and it was superb. Very, very yummy.The service was very pleasant and helpful. The prices are somewhat premium but one does get good value

I went to the branch at Republic Plaza. I had the Mexican sandwich and the Tiramisu tart to go. Both were excellent!The lady staff did an excellent job explaining all the ingredients in each item: bread for the sandwich, the different layers in the tart, what it does not contain and why (taste-wise), why I needed to wait for my sandwich (because it is made fresh when you order).The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food served. Each piece is done carefully, with a lot of attention paid to the making of the food.I'm definitely going back to try all their different items

Dropped by for a quick bite and the kids love the ham sandwich. I was a little taken aback by the price (almost $9 for a sarnie). It wasn't as filling as a 6inch sub but to compare it with a sub isn't fair too. The bread was well made. Can't say much more because my toddler left all but a bite for me to try. But if my fussy tot ate his lunch, and looked forward to returning, it must be quite delish. There were desserts but didn't look appetizing enough for me to try. Big kid told me they had a pudding and she tried it once.

We came across this small little shop after a cycling training. The staffs were very friendly and welcoming. They have a selection of croissants, and other pastries with a short menue of pastas and burgers. The drink menue is mainly limited to iced and hot coffee and two or three juices. It is good place for a quick bite
