Nonchalant acceptance. Frowning staff. Probably too irate to not answer my query whether they are open or not.
Cold brew was great.
But i opted not to mind the staff as I was with the great company of good friends.

Good range of hot drinks and very good range smoothies. Fairly basis seating and service. Did not get to see the food menu

I went here the 1st time and i fall in love with the aglio aglio! and since then been ordering the same every time i'm there. The sides are nice too and they have colorful desserts with cool merchandise to sell especially during festive seasons.

The meat was excellent, made to order. Service was wonderful and the advise on the wine was helpful(and correct)

It is always a great place for dessert. The cake was great! I had chocolate cheesecake and matcha delight cake. The Matcha Azuki Latte was wonderful.

Great atmosphere right at Bugis with a nice view of the sky through the glass roof. We sat down to have some coffee and I tried the Chocolate Matcha Latte, that I can highly recommend. Absolutely delicious! Also the staff was extremely helpful and very friendly

Our family went to the The Connoisseur Concerto (TCC) last Monday night for dessert in the atrium at Bugis Junction. Our party of 6 ordered variety of drinks and desserts. I ordered vanilla bean icecream and it was beautiful. My wife had a glass of Moscato which she enjoyed. The service, even late into the night was very, very good. A great place to eat

Terribly understaffed outlet. Impossible to get attention from manager or the other order taker. In fact, they make it a point to not look at you or your frantic waving or loud "excuse me"!!. The food's not bad once you manage to order. Wish they had a better selection of small bites tho.

I was a regular at TCC till a couple years ago. In my recent 2 visits, I noticed they have completely overhauled the menu they had for a very long time and the new menu is really sad.The Good:1. The Spicey Mushroom Tortellini was delicious, and the Broccoli/Pumpkin cheese bake was good too.2. The ambiance here at Bugis Junction is lovely -- open, bright and inviting, especially with the sunlight from the skylight above.1. Service was rather slow for the 2 main courses (25 mins. wait) and even the coffee and dessert we ordered later (20 mins.)2. The Capuccino was horrible -- couldn't even taste the coffee flavor in it.... quite disappointing given that TCC prides itself in its coffees.3. Most of the Mains now consist of PASTA ... whereas earlier they used to have many options without pasta such as Chicken Leg, Chicken Breast, Salmon Steak, Barramundi Steak... those were our favorites and they have all gone off the menu. 4. Sandwich selection is also basic and limited.5. Mushroom soup has changed flavor from what I remember of it from couple years ago. It's not bad, but it's not great.6. Vegetarian dishes are limited to those containing Mushrooms ... I mean seriously??? Earlier there were better choices. Even a home cook can come up with better vegetarian options than this fairly pricey restaurant !!I really hope the management can re-instate the old menu with some dishes from the new menu. You've just lost a TCC regular of past 10 years !!

Came here on 30 December 2016. Had three drinks (about $10 each), 2 main courses and a mushroom soup. Bill came up to about $80 for 3 pax. Sat at the section of the restaurant next to Nando's and Sweet Monster ice cream.The ice chocolate, chocolate frappe and if I remember correctly a ultimate hazelnut frappe were ALL completely diluted and bland. Tasted like ice water to be honest. A total ripoff for the price ($8-$10)Mains were nothing to shout about as it's hideously overpriced. Had the Mentai Prawn Ball Baked Rice S$19.80. Tasted like something heated up in a microwave, not much prawn seen as well. Wild Mushroom Soup S$11 didn't taste very flavourful at all, looks great but the taste is the opposite. The salad wasn't great as well although it was the only decent dish.Service was very average and painfully slow was there were only three staff in that section of the restaurant. Ended up having to walk to a staff member to settle the bill. Staff took forever to attend to requests.WIll not come back. Bugis has loads of other great restaurants offering much better food and value compared to TCC
