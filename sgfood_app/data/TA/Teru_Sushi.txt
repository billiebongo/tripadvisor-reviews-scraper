The oysters only cost $1 each but taste great with the source. The beef with mushroom and the sushi also quite nice. But the drinks are just normal.
4
Had many dinners here, particularly when the restaurant was running a $1/pc oyster promotion. Great tasting fresh sashimi and set meals at reasonable prices depending on perception of value.
5
We came for a Teppanyaki dinner and loved it! The set is perfect and the chef is entertaining. A fun night and great food.

Food was nice. Hearty meal for two including Sake came up to around $220.I particularly liked the Shiok Maki. Hot Sake for $25 a bottle was a good deal.We were fortunate to be there on a not very busy night and had an attentive chef who have excellent recommendations

Sad to learn that the oysters ($1++ each, no minimum order) aren't as nice as before. A friend who is picky about food didn't finish the last of 3 oysters he ordered - this was after he spat the 2nd one out onto his plate.Nobody had a stomachache or diarrhoea after lunch, but it just wasn't a very pleasant-tasting experience, overall. Shame. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats only Accepts reservations - I used Quando

Casual no frills Japanese restaurant at the Link Hotel is popular with the office lunch crowd, including yours truly. And why not? Portions are generous and the lunch bentos come with a variety of sides. It gets a bit expensive for dinner but for lunch, this is one of two good deals in the tiong bahru neighbourhood.

Service was warm and friendly, there was oyster promotion for 1 SGD each and my mates said they were great. Chirashi don was also a big serving with fresh and thick sashimi. We also had the mixed tempura and other sushi rolls. Also had buy 2 get 1 free Asahi beer. Helps that it is within short walk from SGH. We went on a Monday evenin

NOT a good experience. First of all, it wasn't that busy. We got a small table for the two of us and asked for a larger table. They initially stuck us way in the back room when there were plenty of other tables closer to the front. That's not a big deal, only annoying, but after we ordered, they totally forgot about us. When we got our entree, they had forgotten to bring our soup. When I asked for them to return our entree until after our soup they did, but then the soup was cold. We had no chop sticks or silverware, and after asking for it, they forgot. 40 minutes later, we finally got our entree and frankly it was nothing more than mediocre. Blah. for the price, I've had better frankly for less. I understand slow service if they are slow, but for some reason, could be a big Jewish holiday and the neighborhood, they were quiet. I also wonder why they kept us waiting for a 1/2 hour when there were that many tables in the back. Frankly I doubt if many of their Asian servers are Jewish and therefore off that night! Ouch! Won't be missing anything if I never return

Dining at Teru, is always an OMAKASE option for me and my buddy. Though, we have the option to sit in the private room for OMAKASE, we always prefer front Row Seat at the counter facing the Chef.Chef Steve is warm and friendly person who will be able to wow your taste pallette. Each Visit to Teru, Chef Steve never fails to wow me and my buddy. The fish served is always of the freshest quality directly imported from Japan. Sauces if used any in the Sashimi or sushi are often created specifically by the Chef for the customer of Teru. From the raw food to the Kitchen food, I highly recommend Teru. For those who love Chirashi Don, Teru served one of the best Chirashi Don, I ever tasted in Singapore. highly recommended for those who like their Japanese food

~back in 2016Jan Celine recommended we go for chef's choice and our colleagues were so glad we'd allowed ourselves to be surprised for lunch :)~Teru Sushi is an unassuming restaurant on the street level across the road just below Link Hotel, driving or getting dropped off, make sure you keep far right and enter the slip road to the entrance of the Link Hotel~when open their red lanterns are lit up and if you're going for dinner, come back at 6pm~their $1 Hiroshima Oysters promotion is really something to take up if still available~the choices Celine asked Steve (one of the sushi chefs) to create for us were simply delicious and reasonably priced :)~my 2nd trip with my wife was great as wellTeru Bara Chirashi - my wife was so happy with this dish absolutely just right for her!Matsu Set Teppanyaki has a few hits and misses - overall I really enjoyed the hits so yes YUMzpitan toufu is silky and a lovely starter my wife took this from methe lobster head miso soup was literally just the head in the soup, not much flavor transfercod fish in a soupy homemade sauce is super deliciousthe sprinkles of crispy garlic in the half lobster makes a great additionblack pork slices were tasty and just what's expected goes well with ricethe mixed vegetables are super fresh and goes so well with the fried rice which came earlier unfortunately I'd finished half before the cod fish arrived!choice of ice cream I selected YUZU which helped cleanse the palate!you'd love the care of service the staff goes into unobtrusively being attentive and frequent interventions to make us feel taken care of... there's a very lovely hostess looking manager I think that hovers over every table ever so fleeting just to swoop in to assist with explanations or serving... the owner looking guy is also very friendly when we're making payment making sure to ask about our visit and wishing us a speedy return

the food is very fresh, the set lunch is reasonable value. ala cart is expensive. but good to try. fresh oyster not suggest to order, the others is good
5
We always come here for the oyster! best price and good quality too. The do not have this in the menu and I recommend you call and book in advance for the oyster as they dont have this everyday
5
Food is fresh & excellent here. But their lunch promo items are very worth ordering as the same dish for dinner will cost almost double. Also have $1 oysters without li mit of orders
4
The restaurant offers three different styles: table, bar and teppanyaki. We sat at a table and ordered oysters, sushis, sashimi. The 1$ oysters were so big and tasty! Yummy! I also tried the tofu, another speciality of this nice restaurant. Highly recommended.
5
Their $1 oysters imported from Hiroshima, Japan are the best. As it happens I was in Hiroshima the week before and the oysters were $3 each. We had several other sashimi and sushi dishes. Everything was excellent
4
The restaurant is located within the row of shops at Link Hotel. We sat at the counter and the chef decided on the sashimi and sushi to serve. We were not disappointed. It was a Wednesday night and the fish was very tasty. The salmon belly melted in my mouth. He served other fishes which I cannot pronounce and was not disappointed. We also had the beef cubes and grilled fish cheek.Starter was cold tofu with century egg. Lovely.The night ended with an amazing sushi. It was a half-boiled quail egg wrapped with a thin sliced of beef. The beef was torched and the sushi was topped with uni. I will not describe the experience so that you can be the judge yourself. Try it.Chef Steven on the counter and Chef Ian in the kitchen. Great stuf

We were attracted to the $1 oyster and wanted to see what's the catch for it. There was none and the 18 oyster we ordered were really good. We further ordered another 5 dishes to complement the oysters. The Cha Soba was quite nice, the maguro was good quality tuna. The grilled salmon head was fresh and tasty on its own. The foie gra mushi was however a let down. Over all with green tea totals $110. Including Svc and fat. Not too bad.

This unassuming restaurant was right next door to our hotel. The service was friendly and the food superb. Oysters were on special the night we visited, dressed simply with lemon, fresh and delicious. We followed with the assorted sashimi, seaweed salad and grilled octopus. Accompanied by hot sake, it was a delicious meal
3
We arrived towards the end of lunch service and so the restaurant was practically empty. Tried the foie gras rolls and some squid. Sadly just average. Should probably have tried a wider selection to test out this restaurant as it came with good online recommendations. Sadly, didn't hit the mark for us on this occasion
3
The service was not spectacular & for the price of the food it was very average. It was so expensive we didn't even order any drinks. The air conditioner was unpleasantly cold. The only real positive was that the oysters where cheap! My husband joked that we should of just eaten them instead!

I have had dinner here numerous times over the last 7 weeks.
A great Japanese restaurant with an excellent selection.
Helpful and friendly staff.
Great chefs and the presentation is exceptional.
Well done.

I ate here whilst staying in the Link hotel next door. It is a great restaurant. The service is of a very high standard and the quality of food was excellent. Good beer too!
Would highly recommend to all.

We stopped here for dinner on 20 June 2014 and really liked the food and ambience. We like Japanese and the food did not disappoint. Very nice and recommended!

Main teppanyaki chef - Rocky is the best cook ever. Witty and entertaining. Providing the best tasting food with laughter. Sushi and sashimi are fabulous as well!

Went here on the 28th May 2015 to try their $1 oysters. I suppose the staff was really pissed that we only ordered oysters as they gave us dark looks. Perhaps, we went near their end of lunch timing which was at 2.30pm. Their whole staff were unfriendly. Nevertheless, the oysters were fresh and huge and i was satisfied with the food

Celebrated Mother's Day at Teru Sushi this year. We visit this restaurant occassionally for a year or two and has not visited since they renovated. So we thought it's a good opportunity to do so.The newly renovated place looks great! There are some open sitting area, a few tatami rooms, a lounge area with sofas and a large screen TV and at the back a pool table. Depending on what is your mood there is a place for you. Because we have a number of children in our party we reserved the lounge area.Teru serves a variety of whisky, cognac and sake as well but we go there mainly for their food and friendly services. The chefs are always very pleasant and easy to talk to. If you are not sure what you like, the chefs always have good recommendations. Their ingredients are fresh and the price is reasonable. If you drive, there are ample parking at the back of the restaurant. The nearest MRT station is Outram Park and you have to cross the overhead bridge to SGH side of the road to take a bus. It's just one bus stop away but will take about 8-10 minutes to walk there.Will visit again soon.

Really Awesome food at very good value here!!! I was drawn by the $1 Oysters promo and decided to check out this place.. The Oysters were huge and fresh and the food was exquisite!!! It's 5 Star food & service at commoner prices!!! I was celebrating my gf's birthday and when the chef found out he took extra good care of us by sending us a free glass of sake to go with our Foie Gras Sushi and grilled Puffer fish!!! :)The sashimi was so fresh, any fresher u will have to fish for it yourself! Thick and generous slices of sashimi..ordered extra portions of white tuna because both of us just love the taste & texture of this delicate fish.. And the chef did not disappoint..the tuna was simply perfect!!!Chef Ian is apparently the creator of the Shiok maki in SG, so it's a 'die die must try' dish!!! Diet out the window already!!! Thank you for making it such an Awesome experience we 2 ladies will b back for sure!!!They r opened till 5am recently to cater to clubbing crowd so go check them out!!

Simply loved the chef omakase (meaning leaving it for chef to plan the meal) He is a friendly and funny guy. Gives good advice on seasonal catch. Although he seems young but has a good mix of creativity and traditional japanese cooking style. Should try. There are opens seats as well as private tatami rooms. Reservation needed at times

This is a good place for lunch, given their lunch specials and discounts for certain credit cards. Special mention goes to their Shiok Maki, which is really shiok. The salmon mentai is also a longtime favorite. The bento set is very filling, and comes with a nice chawamushi in rich stock. Recommended for good value for lunch

A customer suggested this place for a quick and convenient lunch. Located in 3 star Link hotel , the carpark was hard to find. Entering the restaurant, we found overselves the only patrons, not a good sign. The waitresses only seemed to be comfortable in chinese, another bad sign. Read the menu and things are not cheap, in this unimpressive place. Teppanyaki is $80 and up, sashimi platters for $55, temakis for $8-10. We ordered the sashimi platter, 2 types of rolls and a temaki each. The sashimi were quite thick and ok, but only contained the cheap stuff - salmon, yellowtail etc. The temaki was quite disappointing, looked limp and there was only a sliver of tuna in it. The rolls were ok, and by then, i decided to not even think of the food and focused on the conversation. Luckily the total bill was reasonable, which soothed the pain a littl
