If you want to look for freshness, this si the place you should visit, price wise is quite reasonable.

Came here for lunch as the set is S$15++. We ordered the Katsu and Orange Chicken sets. Comes with udon, chawamushi, tempura (2 prawns), soup, salad n fruits. Both sets tasted good and the price is definitely worth it.

This place is located on the B2 level of the Shoppes and we were looking for an early dinner, since we were tight on time. The interior design looked quite futuristic with a sushi conveyer belt at the bar counter. The restaurant was empty around 6pm, so our food arrived quite fast. The california rolls were quite huge, but the taste was quite average. For the main course we had something similar to orange chicken with rice. The service staff were oblivious of the surroundings and customers, at times forgetting to bring this and that for a proper table setup. Maybe should have tried their bento boxes..

We arrive to the restaurant at 9 to have some dinner, first thing that they told us was that the kitchen closes at 10 so last order at 9.30, so far understandable, but after they mess up the order and told us that they will not do the right order... So... We rush to eat and the food that we didn't want it. Not good

Comparing to the crowded Orchard road, Marina Bay Sands has much less visitors during the weekend. This sushi restaurant, located at B2, is perfect for family with kids. My baby had a great nap here.The food here is worth the money. That is what I can say. By the way, the wasabi here is very fresh.I will come back again

We wanted a quick lunch while we were in this shopping centre. I must say it was a little difficult to find, given the size of the centre, but we're glad we finally found it. We had a Bento Box and had a couple of beers. The service was quick and food was good. Would definitely go there again if we're in the area.

I had the donburi bento set lunch and the portion was big. The food was tasty and value for money. I ordered green tea and it was not cheap - $4 for a cup of tea. However, you can always request for more hot water. Service was fast. Will come back again to try other set lunch options.

We are quite frequent diners at this restaurant. The service staff are not particularly friendly (not rude) but what made us return is the quality of the food and they are fast to serve the food. The place is usually not crowded during dinner (at least the 6-7 times we dined there in the evening). The sashimi and sushi and the ingredients used are fresh in my opinion compared to other locations I dined before and the price is reasonable for the quality (minus the service

There is in fact nothing really special about this eatery, but the food is OK and you will get your order fast. I dropped by for dinner and left within half an hour after having a multi-course tasty dinner

Overall good Experience, however they don't really cater for children. My Daughter likes sushi with chicken, and they didn't have anything available or to be made.
My experience was great, Fresh sushi was great
3
Once I was entering the place, I was expecting a Japan looked concept bit it was not. Anyway the foods were great,.
4
Sushi dinner plates large, good diversity and taste, not that expensive. Service about 15min. Read the reviews of tripadvisors and was not dissapointed, would recommend.
4
Amazing sushi, the spicy tuna was crazy spicy. No need for soy sauce, wasabi or ginger. Amazing flavors. The salad was so refreshing after eating noodles for so long.
5
After enjoying the fireworks, we found this restaurant provides yummy, affordable price sushi and other food. The service is good also.
3
Everyone has a different taste but in my opinion every sushi restaurant MUST have some choices for vegetarians! If you are a vegetarian quickly find something else..I was there with my friend who eat meat and realy likes sushi and he didn't choose from that menu too.
4
Came here for lunch and there were about 6-8 choices of set lunch and priced at $15++. The set comes with a decent Chawanmushi (Steamed egg), Salad, 2 pieces of orange, Tempura (2 prawn and 1 brinjal) , plus ur choice of main (Orange chicken was highly recommended by my friends). I tried the soba instead and it was not bad, the dip was a tad too sweet. Overall, a very "cheap" and filling set lunch within the usually pricey CBD (Central Business District) area. Do note that the tea is $4 each (where other places usually charge $1-2Max). All prices are not including 17% tax. Take the escalator beside Bread Street to B2

We ate twice at this restaurant whilst attending a travel fair at MBS. The first time we had sushi, and both the quality and taste were very good, the second lunch was less successful, we both opted for a bento box. The food was not we expected, the quality and the appearance was not to the same standards as their sushi
5
I ate there twice during my stay at Singapore. The place itself is nothing special, the service not particularly friendly. However, it is efficient. But the food itself is delicious. We had avocado salads, Shrimp tampuras, sushis, sashimis, and the quality was really excellent, for a price which is not cheap but acceptable. OVerall a very good experience for Japonese food lovers

Had the Bento box lunch set.
Service is ok, waiting time 15 mins.
Food was delicious, didn't got the time to try other dish because of time constraints.
Will come back someday to try more stuff

This sushi restaurant is situated right opposite the bay and is very very fresh.
Highly Recommended.
5
Highly recommend we had the nabe set x 2 and then beef Terrayaki and sushi and shared between four of us. . The beer good, the food delicious

I enjoyed my meal here, they have some kind of set meals that are good size and great flavor, I also tried a sushi roll with tortilla, cheese, jalapeno and something else...it was wonderful!Prices were not bad (please keep in mind that Singapore is all expensive).this is a nice stop for a bite on you shopping day or after the Casino

We ended up having our dinner here since we could not get a table at the bread kitchen and it turned out great. Good set of menu and selection of sushi and sashimi in bento box. Food portion is surprisingly generous and the seafood are really fresh. We had a good dinning experience and service was superb. We will be back

I ate a lunch there on my last day in Singapore. The service was a bit slow, but my sushi bento box was worth the wait. The items ranged from good to very good. The check came up to about S$35 - relatively inexpensive for the (expensive) area. The interior is nice and clean. Overall, this restaurant won't blow you away - if that's what you are looking for, Marina Bay Sands is five minutes away - but you will get a pleasant experience for not a lot of money. Recommended

The worst restaurant in Singapore! Terrible food and unacceptable service! You can't image that the store manager didn't feel sorry for keeping the guest waiting for the food over than 30 minutes. He said that this is the Singapore rule and this is the normal waiting time. And then he forced the guest to make the payment immediately as the "close time" is approaching and this is also the Singapore rule. When the customer was still working on the food, the waitress came to ask if it can be taken away. Is this a real Singapore service? The store manager wanted the guest to understand that this is Japanese restaurant. Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! Don't waste your money and time to go such a place. Never

We ate here 3 times during a week's visit to Singapore. It was nearby, we love Japanese food, and we don't get much of it where we live. The evening bentos were superb and varied, and the sushi, maki, and hot dishes we tried another evening were also delightful - and beautifully presented. The service was friendly and attentive and the setting - despite being in a mall - actually felt relaxing: something rare in that huge complex.The conveyor belt experience was, however, disappointing. OK, it seemed to be a quiet evening but despite the list of different "colours and prices" to choose from, our selection was limited to various different plates of 3 makis all at the same price, examples of some menu items in large bowls that you had to have cooked, and some rather luridly coloured, industrial-looking desserts. Yes, the makis were tasty but I would have expected more choice - some salads, some skewers, some sushi... All in all, however, a pleasant place. Shame about the conveyor

We went there because the foodcourt 1 level up was very crowded. Price was pretty reasonable, weekend lunch bento was $18++ with quite a bit of variety of side dishes. Taste wise, it was okay. Not too bad, but nothing to shout about. The most 'notable' feature was it's service. We were there at 2.10pm and was told that the restaurant will be closing at 3pm, we really felt we were not welcomed. This is not withstanding the fact that no one greeted us at the entrance even though we were standing outside for a few minutes, trying to figure out if it's still open, as it was quiet and the staff was just standing there, doing nothing. We went in and not long after that, we noticed customers being turned away. Would I go again? Maybe. It's not very costly, considering the fact it is in MBS, and as compared to the bustling activities in the mall, the quietness was good enough for me to get over the feeling that I wasn't welcomed

Bay Sushi is a contemporary roll and sushi restaurant with a modernistic elegant interior to it, complete with beautiful ceiling lamps, an irridescent pillar behind the conveyor belt as well as comfortable woven seats.They have quite a few interesting items on the menu, so we settled for ordering different items to share, starting with the must-have Chawanmushi (SGD$4.00) - piping hot Japanese steamed egg custard that was smooth and rich with seafood chunks within.Next, we had the Gold Dragon Roll (SGD$16.00) - consisting of crab meat, cucumber dices, eel on the outside and crispy tempura batter flakes on top. Besides looking good in appearance, this combination of ingredients brought about varied textures and delicious flavors burst that were a lovely treat to the tongue for sure.Following that, we had the Golden Spider Roll (SGD$16.00) comprising of deep fried soft shell crab and avocado. While the soft shell crab was crispy and went well with the buttery-flavored avocado cubes, we thought that the dark-orangey gravy was too sweet. It softened the crab very quickly, as well as steers the taste of the entire sushi roll the wrong way.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/04/dinner-at-bay-sushi-japanese-restaurant.htm

The Sushi taste was excellent. My gf ordered twice(normally she don't eat much in evening). I also loved its taste but not much as my gf. A truly Japanese Sushi which you cant find in US, she said.

I came here over lunch with colleagues.I ordered a set lunch and additional California Handroll...In my opinion, the food quality is acceptable and so is the price taking into consideration of the location. Since the location of the restaurant is at Marina Bay Sands.However, I'm not willing to pay more for dinner if there's no set promotion like lunch. For it's food quality is acceptable but not fantastic

Loacted in massive Marina Bay Sands hotel mall area, Bay Sushi restaurant was a good find.We had shopped all morning a d was dying for lunch. I had a sushi bento box with misogyny soup, tempura veggies & shrimp( the usual). My wife had miso soup & rainbow role & eel role. We both Both had beer .... very good "stop" for lunch. The food court at Marina Bay Sands mall is also a winner.....Big variety of cuisines and most a very good

Having been in the Marina bay complex for a while, we looked for a light meal and Bay Sushi looked inviting.It was not crowded or particularly busy and plenty of seating. we sat near the bar and had a chat with the chef who told us what was fresh and his recommendations for a light meal.We had salmon which was cooked beautifully along with some sashimi items.Prices are reasonable for the location given the rents people must pay in the Marina Bay.I would say that the lack of customers and the quietness of the restaurant does not make a great atmosphere. I am sure the situation changes when there are more people dining. Absolutely nothing to criticise about the food whatsoever. they deserve to have more people dining

Most important point, the service, like what one of the previous reviewer stated, leaves much to be desired. Food - Attractive presentation, have their own style of creating their sushi, tasty, freshService- Adequate when waiting for a table. Took our food order. Then we called another server to order drinks, the drinks didn't appear even when our first dish arrived. We called the server who took our food order, to check. It turned out the drinks order wasn't even keyed in. After the first round, we ordered 2 more sushi as we were still slightly hungry, waited for 20-25 minutes and the first dish came. Finished the first dish and waited for another 10 minutes but the order didn't come still. My friend got frustrated and told the server if the dish has not been prepared, just cancel it. I gave the service a 1 star as its simply not acceptable for them to make 2 consecutive mistakes.Location- At one end of MBS

Went there on Saturday, 21 June 2014 with my siblings and a friend for dinner. The restaurant is not crowded and was able to get a table instantly (without making a reservation).The menu tend to have limited choices. We order some sushi for sharing and my siblings and friend had Dons while I had Udon as our mains. The sushi were fresh and filling, the portions were just right. My Udon was done perfectly but the review from my siblings and friend is that their Don is average. Especially the Katsu Don that my brother ordered. It was too oily and he suffered alittle indigestion after meal.The service staff whom was serving us was great and attentive. As we were not very sure what we ordered, he took the initiative to introduce each dish that he serves and gave a short explanation on the ingredients used for the sushi. We were all very impressed with his high service standard.Definitely a place to recommend to anyone

Being in the Marina Bay complex, I was pretty worried that it would cost the earth, as there are a lot high-end shops - Gucci, Mont Blanc etc etc ... But I was very surprised by the price of the meal. It was S$15 for a Bento box and the portions were surprisingly generous and pretty tasty.The only thing that let them down was the service. It was difficult to nigh-on impossible to get the attention of the waiting staff

We came across Bay Sushi restaurant when looking for a place to have lunch in Marina Bay Shoppes mall. It is tucked away at one end of the mall, next to Todai buffet restaurant. Prices are very reasonable and for $18++ I got a Bento Box meal on a tray (see picture). The food was delicious and a generous amount of food for the price. It is on the other end of the shopping complex than the food court. Nice ambience and setting, friendly staff, I would definitely return to eat here again, if given the chance. Much better than the food court, which we walked past the next day, which was very crowded
