Interesting concept. Paying for atas wanton mee ingredients. Food is good. Portions were small but surprisingly filling.
4
This is my 3rd time at Wanton and they did not disappoint. Springy noodles with great wantons (tried both versions). And the mushrooms (although a little steep) is simply the best dish.
5
Food is very good. Good food and good place. Good people and good ambience. Will come back again many many times
2
Not going here again. This place doesn't care about its customers. After ordering a full lunch set, with extra wontons and beverage I asked for a glass of water while I waited for lunch as I had just walked a fair distance and was parched. The answer - "no, we don't provide water during lunch, only during dinner". "I just bought a full lunch set, surely you can give me a glass of water?. "No - It's the rules". wtf? I won't give my business to places that are purely transactional and have no real regard for the customer
4
Decent food! The noodles were about $1 for a small portion, order about 2 is sufficient. Enjoyed the free flow of soup. Other food wise were considered slightly expensive for the portion, but food is above average. Tried the fried wanton and roast pork and fried kailan. Enjoyed the service too.
5
Service was great!Noodles were delicious and several meals to go with it as well (wontons, pork, veggie mushrooms, scallops...)Price is a bit high but quality is there ! Don‚Äôt hesitateIn addition this is a really nice area of Singapour to walk around and have drinks
5
Been here for lunch and decided to drop by with my friends for dinner. It wasn't too crowded and we were seated at the bar where all the action is at. We ordered the Chashu/Roast Pork Belly/Wantons and 3 bowls of noodles each. All of the dishes were well prepared and the service staff were courteous and helpful in helping us decide what to order. Will drop by again real soon

I love the concept - $1 noodles and then add on your dishes like roast pork, veg, etc. Soup and deep-fried pork lard are free flow.First - the good. Food is good - noodles are al dente, the roast pork was succulent and tender, the soup was a little on the sweeter side but hey, free flow soup and free flow pork lard (traditional wanton noodle trimming)? Good stuff. However - I can get a good wanton noodle from a hawker stall for $3-$6, and that's the noodles, pork, soup, and maybe 2 slivers of veg combined. I don't think that Wanton is so much better than hawker centres that I'd pay >$10 for roast pork alone to go with my $1 noodles. I think it's a great place to go for date night or with a small group of friends, or if you want to introduce out-of-town friends to local food. It's not something I'd go for all the time though.
4
A lot of people will take offense with the fact that you're charging upwards of $10 for something as simple as wanton mien but you'll change your mind once you sink your teeth into the char siew and pork bellies these guys have taken such great care in re-creating. The noodles are also neither al-dente (if you get a lazy hawker) or too mushy (if you get someone who doesn't care about his food). It's a Goldilock's just-right. So why not 5 stars? The cocktails left much to be desired and having to wait 10 mins despite making a reservation doesn't bode well for the restaurant neither but I will definitely keep coming back for my love of their char siew (and their awesome lunch menu).
4
The concept of the restaurant + bar is good and the food generally taste good. But the star of the menu is the char siew!! It is a good place to be when you are feeling a little rich and feel like having wanton noodles and other dishes with a fusion twist. We used the entertainer app as well, so it was slightly less pricey for us....
4
Taking traditional wanton noodle and giving it a fusion twist. The concept was interesting and the taste was good. More of an once off experience, no desire for return. Food portion is too small for price (i.e., $50 for wanton noodle for 2 person).
5
We finally visited Wanton Seng after being recommended by our friends and the food did not disappoint. Loved the char siew and chilli fried wontons!
5
Came here n times, standard is quite good. Only the plating for some dishes changed. Other than that ambience and service is great! Enjoyed ourselves üòç
5
They gave us free Kai lan on the house. Very nice of them to do so. Food was great. Noodles were great. Salted chicken wings were awesome.
4
Overall, the food was quite good except for the chili that is not fiery enough and was quite salty after adding a little more to the noodles. Service by the waiter was good despite being so short handed.
3
Lunching at this place as my colleague highly recommended. It tasted average for me and i feel the price is high end for a wanton noodles, probably because it is a bar like place.
3
Order the char siew, you won‚Äôt regret it! This restaurant has a small seating capacity so be sure to make a reservation before going.
5
Always love going back to Wanton for the pork belly char siew. Even greater value now with the Entertainer app.
5
I love coming to this place - it‚Äôs chill, has nice modern decor, good food, good music, good drinks. Especially nice at night with the chill atmosphere at Amoy Street. Great place for groups, and to bring visiting friends to Singapore. Service is always great - quick and effective. Sat at the bar today - even personalized service from the chefs! Food is great - a modern twist on wonton noodles, or ‚Äúdeconstructed noodles‚Äù as the staff calls it. Innovative menu, nice execution and presentation. Keep up the great work!
4
I was here january for dinner, the place was easy to find, it looks like a bar with bar table and bar stool. The noodle was good, the chasiu and the spicy dumpling also good, but the size wasn‚Äôt that big, so at the end i order another noodle only, the extra noodle will only charge you 1 SGD.The total price for 1 person including extra spicy dumpling was 31.8 SGD
4
Our local wanton mee when done right is full of flavour with noodles cooked al dente. This venue has done it perfectly with a modern touch.
5
I have been here more than 3 times, all for dinner. I love the music and hip ambiance, the staffs are cool an good at recommending great dishes. The noodles are freshly made and the side dishes are original recipes with a slight twist.
5
Hole in the wall find. Amazing find with good food, drinks, ambience and service! One of the best wanton mees around.
4
A good place for both lunch and dinner. The char Siew is really good. I will definitely come back to visit again.
4
great atas wanton mee! the boiled wantons (9 for $6) are my favorite! and nudles at $1 per bowl. we got bar seats and got to see the chef prepare our food before our eyes. if you're around the area, you should try
5
The food is really good and service is warm and friendly. Also the pint-sized cocktails are my favourite highlight of their menu
4
the portion of the meat actually is quite big... suggest shared by 2 ppl and can order 2 bowl of the noodle
4
Came here for dinner last week and found this restaurant to be serving local wanton noodle with a twist. The noodles were ok, the side dishes (e.g. the torched pork belly char siew was juicy and flavourful, the fried dumplings with XO sauce was just very ordinary). Ambience wise, it‚Äôs like a bar. Overall, it gives me a good dining experience.
2
Went there for the sake of using the Entertainer‚Äôs App as they offer 1 for 1 for both food and drinks. During the order, staff is aware that we will be using the app, but didn‚Äôt mention that we can ONLY redeem EITHER food OR drink because we have less than 4 pax. So we were only informed in a very unfriendly manner while making payment. Not to mention that their ventilation system is so bad that all of us walked out smelling like roasted pork. Food is okay but I will not go back for that service again
4
Came here for dinner last week with a friend and opted for some noodles and beers. Really very tasty food. Only downside is that you sit next to the kitchen so end up stinking of cooking smells. But the service was friendly, the food decent and the beers cold. Worth another visit
5
Like their meat and wanton, nice take on the traditional dish. The drink portion is generous!! Recommend
5
Love the SOUP, the NOODLES, the service and the MEATS! This place is simple yet satisfying, highly underrated if you ask me. Definitely going again :)
4
Location near Tanjong Pagar MRT (5-8min walk)
Food are delicious except for XO fried watan abit salty.
5
Love their concept of serving the wanton noodles as an accompaniment rather than the main dish. The noodles are very fragrant and the chicken wings is awesome! Must-go!
3
Char siew pork belly was tender and delicious. The XO Pork dumplings were really good too. Noodles weren't great. Wish dishes were priced lower, and that the place would be quieter.
4
If you are looking for something different than the usual wanton mee, this is the place! Love their XO fried wanton and the pork belly dishes. Soup is free flow from a warm flask; so is chilli and pork lard if you are a fan of those. Am always impressed by their service - the crew is always unobtrusively observant and quick to react
5
This is definitely a place that i‚Äôll be back again in future! Star of the night was the pork belly and springy wanton Noodles. I just can‚Äôt get enough of the noodles - cooked perfectly to what the Italians would say al dente! For the quality and location, I think price was reasonable. Must try
5
I have been in Singapore for two weeks, stumbled across this place by accident, or maybe not, I followed my nose. Has to be the nicest place, Brendan and his team made me feel very welcome, explained all the dishes, then left me to make my own choice. The chefs were very attentive to my ignorance of what goes with what. I have attached some photos of my couple of nights there. Not to be missed and very reasonable
4
Local friends suggested this place for a lively lunch and it turned out very well. I had the chrysanthemum jasmine tea "brew" to drink, which was refreshing (served cool) and different, and we had fried wontons and boiled dumplings to start--all tasty and freshly made. The rest of the table had char siu noodle for mains (an all-around hit), while I went with the crispy duck noodle. It was great--very flavorful--but a little tough. We shared an order of shiitake mushrooms as well, another tasty treat. In all, so much food that the four of us couldn't finish it all, and very reasonably priced. The place was crowded, so I'm glad our friends had called ahead--we were seated right away. Fun place
5
Found this place by accident and turned out to be a very happy accident. Interesting concept to have noodles as the main to go with the sides. Ordered the char siu and ribs which were superb. Moist, perfectly seasoned and marinated. Can't say the same for the wonton. They're just wonton with different sauces. The chili wonton was a tad too hot and the XO wonton was better. The soup wonton was the best of the 3 wontons we tried. The salted duck egg chicken wing exploded with flavours. The service was top notch and they took the time to explain the concept of the place to us. (we were treated to two dishes on the house which we appreciated very much but am still wondering why....). We would return for sure and have even recommended the place to many people so they can try next. Definitely coming back again. One of us left her pair of glasses when we left and the owners were nice enough to call and remind us.
5
Springy noodles and flavourful soup. The ala carte dishes are equally delicious. However, the prices has gone up considerably. Still a good value place for good food.
4
I'm looking forward to having Lor Mee in this kind of atmosphere üòΩ Simple local food that I don't have to compete at busy hawker.
4
Service was good and I really liked the food they served for dinner. Although the side dishes were a little expensive, the cheap noodles made the overall meal very affordable.
3
While the char siew, noodles and wanton were nicely done and presented, I felt the price was a little too steep for such average mod-Asian food. Drinks to pair with and ambience were a nice touch.
5
Good attentive service and the food is not bad. Well prepared food with love! Going for dinners on weekends or would be good to book on Chope first!
5
Great restaurant! Food was decently priced and service was as usual excellent. Love the style of this restaurant - $1 noodles with mains
5
The noodles is rather small portion but still filling. The pork belly is nice and portion is quite big.
The cafe is pack thus have take the seats outside which is also alright just abit hot and noisy.
5
Loves the springy mee and the wanton! Will be back for more to try other dishes. Location is convenient
4
Atas version of hawker wanton mee. We ordered 2 bowls of noodles, which was cooked al dente and delicious even on its own. We also ordered the char siew and pork. The pork was a little too fatty for our liking though. And we loved the soup! Best of all, it's refillable and unlimited! Good to try once but will probably not return. Nothing spectacular.
4
Love the wantons and dumplings here. Not to mention the noodles! It's a great place in Amoy to have fulfilling dinner before heading to the many bars nearby for drinks. Only gripe was that the music was too loud! it's a dinner place not a bar/club, the music should be a tad lower in volume then people won't have to shout to have conversations over dinner
5
Taking traditional dishes and giving it a modern twist. I like the free flow soup at the start before ordering your meal, the aburi char siew is soft and flavourful, salted egg chicken wings is nice without the bones in the mid wing section.
4
Delectable mix of comfort local noodles with well-done side dishes, all washed down with piping hot soup straight from the flask. Especially love the fried wantons and aburi char siu. Missing the yam croquettes though.
5
I've been there several times for lunch but never for dinner . We enjoyed the salted egg duck wings, and the boiled wantons . Price wise quite reasonable and best of all the one dollar nudles ! Only gripe was table was a bit small
3
Food was ok, quite smokey and we smelled cuz we sit near the counter.
Super disliked when they took away my phone for quite Long when I wanted to claim for my voucher.
4
wanton mee was decent, though a little pricey. the highly recommended pork trotter dish was a little dry. loved the other sides though. service was very friendly and prompt, and interesting ambience.
3
The noodles are basically a version of Kuching Kolo Mee (where I'm from). In my hometown, kolo mee to the locals is similar to bak chor mee for SIngaporeans. Hence, I was quite disappointed to find that their ramen was actually just a repackaging of Kolo Mee which I've had much better before at lower price points (comparing dollar-for-dollar).Apart from that, their other dishes are not too bad but nothing I would go back for. Atmosphere is nice but a little cramped.It might be just because I came from where this ramen is based on but I wouldn't recommend for those that have been to Kuching before and tried the local kolo mee
5
food was not disappointing. We ordered soup wanton, aburi char siu and the signature char siu! I like especially the signature char siu! The noodles was perfectly cooked(not too soft). It was so good till we finished everything! Not to mention, the pork lard taste damm good too! Wil definitely visit the place again as the team makes me feel welcomed!
3
Just felt the noodles weren't that tasty this time and didn't impress one out of three of us in the group. Tried the new XO Wantons on the latest menu which was not bad with some belachan on top. The new lor bak was a tad dry and lacked flavour
4
Came for lunch and had char siew noodles. The noodles were tasty and servings are good size. Plenty of condiments to add including pork lard. Soup was good too. Bit pricey but its in the CBD. It also has limited seating so have to be patient to get a table
4
We ordered plain noodles and side dishes to share. The "plain" noodles are quite tasty and decent serving. Each bowl of noodles is SGD1!!! The side dishes - roasted pork, salted egg yolk wings - are yummy. The restaurant also has an interesting way of self-service. There is free-flow of soup. A flask of soup is placed at the table for you to pour as much as you desire to drink. All the condiments are also placed on trays beside the table for you to help yourself. This restaurant is also located in happening Club Area and you can go for a stroll or cuppa after dinner
5
One of my favourite places to go to for Wanton noodles! Less than $15 for a sumptous meal. Service was really good too - staff were attentive and helpful. They love their food!
5
Excellent food, dedicated service, and affordable for a CBD location.
Just looking at how each dish was prepared was satisfying. Thank you for the great experience.
Food: 7.5/10
Atmosphere: 7/10
Service: 9/10
5
Great variety of selection with great quality food made available for selection to diners. Perfect lunch/ dinner location
5
The almost drunk pork belly is super rich and the noodles are very springy! Definitely will return for more :)
4
noodles not bad, tasty and if warmer will be nicer. side dishes are good.experience overall was good , service crew is helpful and quick in service
5
Went there for dinner.
Absolutely loving their wanton noodles, Aburi Pork Belly and the gangster baby Kailan! Fab!
Had a lovely evening at this bar and kitchen. Thanks
2
Had read a lot of good review about this wanton noodle cafe, has came down to try it. During dinner, you will have to order the side dishes separately. Noodle is cheap though, but the other main and side dishes like Char Siew, vegetables, lor ba etc is expensive for a portion of wanton that shared about 2 person. We have ordered the wanton and salted egg chicken wings together with 2 bowl of noodles. The noodles don't really taste springy and lack of taste. The wanton is normal while the salted egg chicken wings is very small with just a bit of meat. Not really recommended as there are better wanton noodle out there and it is over priced
4
Went here between cocktail bars on Amoy for some quick eats to line the stomach last year and then went again a month ago. The first time I remember that the staff had some amazing tattoos which provided an edgy vibe (a bit like a young yakuza convention). Egg noodles were good (but clearly not as cheap as in a hawker centre), however menu also has a great line in pork belly dishes and the salted duck egg chicken wings are good. Fun place and will definitely try it again if hungry on Amoy. Like the loo at the end labelled Manager's Office
4
Visited the restaurant again to get my atas wanton mee fix. Got really good great seat at the bar ,despite a late booking on Chope, in front of a friendly server making drinks, cashiering and packing food for Deliveroo. The whole place is in a mood - relaxed and jovial. Food was great as expected, a serving of wanton mee, salted duck egg chicken wings and aburi pork belly. Point to note, called in to say I'll be running late and requested to charge my phone, and was greeted by either Ken/Nielsen who accommodated the request and was very polite and friendly (really appreciated this)
3
went for dinner and ordered roasted pork belly, aburi pork belly, Kai lan and fried dumplings. The pork dishes were disappointing- roasted pork belly was dry and not seasoned even though the skin was crispy. Aburi pork was tender, but similarly not well seasoned, the outer coat of sauce was not sufficient to bring out the flavors. Greens were a little oily but the fried dumplings were good.
5
The noodles are addictive!! üëçüëç A contemporary cozy intimate humble joint serving hearty awesome noodles and dumplings!
4
Probably can get better wanton mee at the nearby amos street, but here's a decent place for alcohol in addition. Noodles were sufficiently springy and sides were nice.
5
Efficient service and delicious noodles ($1 per bowl at night!) with a variety of accompaniment dishes to choose from - all of which we loved! .

If you're looking to secure a table prior to heading down, you needn't go through the hassle. While it was a Friday night, I was quite disappointed to know that my reservation did not matter at all, and my friends and I still had to wait for a vacant table. Oh, and we were not late at all; one of my friends arrived 15 minutes before the reserved time. Still, she was told to wait. So why accept reservations at all?Food was truly average. I applaud the restaurant for the hip and modern twist to the average wanton noodles, but the dishes themselves did not live up to the expectations. Even though the noodles were truly springy and delicious, the pork was quite bland, and the wanton fillings were not satisfying in the least. And no chili padi? Very disappointing. The only chili available barely had any kick to it.I did like the ambiance of the area; the restaurant is located at one end of Amoy St, and there are no loud bars or restaurants next to it. If you're not a smoker and you don't mind cigarette smoke, consider sitting outside. The music isn't as annoying as if you were seated inside the place. My friends and I enjoyed the free flow of lard and sea cucumber soup as they filled our tummies prior to the main dishes. We also found our waiter charming and accommodating; he never once frowned at our requests, however repetitive. The dishes worth our money were the salted egg fried chicken and baby kailan. The rest, sorry to say, fell quite short of the hype
4
The restaurant operates on the 'open kitchen' concept that complements the casual dining feel of the place. Visited during lunchtime and it was fairly crowded with a queue forming outside. Do note that the lunch menu has lesser options compared to the dinner menu and that one cannot make lunchtime reservations. Despite the queue, we managed to get seated fairly quickly and we ordered the lunch set meal. (Twosome, Threesome wanton bowls with fried dumplings and 5 minute egg add-ons respectively and a side of the Gangster Baby Kailan. The noodles were well cooked and overall the elements of the Wanton bowl blended well with each other without any particular aspect being overbearing on the palate. The soup which some complained to be 'bland and tasteless' was actually quite well made. Tbh the horror stories about poor service, mediocre food and long wait times were completely unfounded. However, due to the small size of the restaurant, it is not advisable to linger after finishing the food as they need the tables for fast turnovers. Will not recommend for large group visits unless it is dinner and with reservations. Otherwise, brilliant little place that is worth the visit
4
It has been some time since I last visited Wanton. SInce we have a chope voucher, my sis and I went over for some snacks. We were delighted taken by surprise that apart from their wanton noodles. The other dishes were great too! We had the salted egg yolk chicken wings, fried egg with mango salad which are top on our favorites. Music a little off and too loud for us though
5
First time using Chope app to make a reservation at Seng's. Friends were a little late but they showed no displeasure and instead offered to shift me to another table where it was more spacious. Ate there a couple of times and the food this time was awesome as usual. The atmosphere there is one of a kind, makes it a really cool place to hangout and chill over a bowl of decent noodles. Hipster vibes check. Yummy traditional wanton check. While you're at it, don't forget to try their salted egg yolk wings.
5
Located at almost the end of Amoy Street, where quaint 2 storey turn of the last century shophouses have been converted to restaurants, gyms and office space, Wanton is a revelation! Just a year old, Wanton has a great concept where one can order their 'sides' to add to the SGD 1 noodles! I had the wantons (of course!)√Ç¬† And the Seng-katsu(slow cooked pork jowl, dragon sauce!) came highly recommended. Absolutely delicious!! The dollar bowls are small so ordering another is par for the course. Free condiments at each table allow one to experiment...more chili sauce? Or dark soy sauce? Pork lard anyone? Or the so sweet green peppers? Come early or reserve a table! I will return!
4
Thought the dishes were pretty interesting take on local food (abit overpriced). Service was warm and not too overly attentive. I still prefer regular wanton mee though! Felt the plain noodle was lacking something, could use some lard, spring onion or sesame oil for a hint of flavour.Nevertheless, if i wanted a comfortable place for "chinese" food before drinks in the area, I definitely would go back
4
First off: I didn't spell noodles wrongly hahaOk now the serious bit - I went for dinner with my date, and ordered:Fried Dumplings Almost Drunk Pork Belly3 bowls of NudlesOk so I really like the Nudles, which are Egg Noodles, cooked just right. Not too soft, and not too hard. Springy, and easy to eat.The Fried Dumplings were the star for me. I loved how subtle the spicy sauce tasted, and how crunchy the skin was. When we bit in, there was an entire prawn inside the dumpling. True value for money.The Almost Drink Pork Belly was a savoury dish, and it did feel a little like drunken chicken, but with Pork. It went well with the nudles, and I will return to try the Aburi Pork belly.We spent a total of $40 for 2 pax, and found it a good place to have dinner. Will return again
3
We were on our way to A Noodle Story but they were sold out already. My friend remembered good reviews about this place so we found a close by alternative. The food however is very average. Can't say anything bad either. Just normal, nothing great.
5
Reladed and cosy atmosphere. Well-cooked noodle dishes that are quite affordable. It's definitely not the cheapest noodles you find in Singapore but the staff are very service minded and friendly.
5
Lunch and dinner menu is different. Dinner is best with friends or family for sharing. Noodle, wanton, dumplings, and egg are all perfect!!
4
Delicious noodles with broth and amendments. Yes the slow cooked pork belly is killer, without the excessive fat layer you sometimes get. The bad part of dining solo is missing the chance to sample more sides. Everything looked outstanding.
4
Not the normal wanton noodle I imagined - noodles are given separately from the side dishes (which is whatever you have besides the plain noodle). Ordered the top chefs recommendations; the pork belly and gangster baby kailan is.. pretty normal, but the fried wanton was good. The service was excellent - "chope" seats for fear of no space, waiter called relentlessly to reach but still kept the space for us when we didn't answer, constantly making sure that we were ok - excellent service. The food was a tad too expensive though, considering the portion. Appreciate the fairly appealing aesthetics, but the place was quite dim and couldn't really appreciate the presentation.
2
This place is a sort of tapas style wonton noodle bar. You order noodles instead of bread, then add on "charsiu" and/or wontons (or other stuff like Asian Scotch eggs). Not too bad an idea, but kind of fails in terms of execution. Firstly, the portion of the noodles are really small. Noodles aren't expensive. Neither did they price it that high. So, is it really worthwhile to make your customers feel shortchanged over such a little sum? The "charsiu" was more like a braised rather than roasted pork belly, which ended up as a greasy and overly salted dish. The wontons were so disappointingly lackluster. It was minced meat haphazardly wrapped in wonton skins. The seasoning was pedestrian, and the presentation was disastrous. Also, the filling was very little.I've eaten wonton noodles more expensive than this, and I've also eaten those that cost a mere fraction. However, I have never felt more dissatisfied or shortchanged than I have eating here
4
How good can wanton noodles get? Well, this store certainly managed to elevate the hawker dish a couple of notches. Noodles were just a little overcooked so they lost a little of the springiness. Flavours-wise, no complains but for those who have a lighter taste bud, let the waiter know. The char siew is not the common local red variety; what came in my bowl was braised pork belly, which of course i have no complains of. You only live once! Mine was done to perfectionThe Siew Yok (Roast pork) has an amazingly crispy skin and extremely satisfying to crunch down on! Again, if you're health conscious, this shouldn't be a stop for you. We ordered a side of Fried Dumplings as well, and I wonder if they seasoned it the same as they would with Cajun Fries. It isn't bad but these babies are like sodium bombs. The restaurant has limited opening hours - a couple for lunch and a couple for dinner - and they only accept reservations for the evenings so if you're thinking of an afternoon treat, try heading slight after the peak lunch period. 1.30ish should do fine. The restaurant isn't particular spacious and seems more like a eat and go joint with a long counter top, making it a refreshing bar-like experience with its monotone colour schemes. Just be warned, there ain't a lot of tables and it isn't easy to accommodate groups larger than 4!Service was good - prompt and attentive, despite the continuous flow of people. The manager even came and asked for feedback. Highly recommend if you want something above hawker fare but don't want to break your bank either

The full name is "Wanton Seng's Noodle Bar. Saw this joint in Andrew Zimmerman's Delicious Destination and decided to give it a try. The location is not hard to find if you got a GPS phone. The restaurant is actually a small narrow shop with seatings on the outside and bar seating, kinda narrow though, on the inside. Orders are placed at the bar counter and waiters bring the food to you when ready. So we ordered the "Threesome" which has the noodle as the base and comes with wanton, char siew (Chinese roast pork) and roast pork belly. The noodles were cooked slightly softer than al dente style, the wanton and the char siew are ok, but the belly pork is the best of the lot. With 2 bowls of the Threesome and a bottle of distilled water setting us back S$19.50, I would not think this a s a value meal. That said, we were there when they opened at 11.30am and after us the place got filled up and a line is in the wait
5
The noodle texture is very good. Nothing like that at hawker centre's noodles. Sauce is tasty. The pork ribs and char siew are well marinated and tender. The roasted pork is very crispy on the skin and tender on the meat. Good idea with the unlimited refill soup on your table. Is nice to have something different in Singapore that did not lose its local flavor.
4
The shop is located in the middle of a row of shophouses. The shop serves time-perfected wanton noodles, hailing from the famous Seng's Wanton Mee of Dunman Food Centre.The dine in area was quite small, with mostly counter seats surrounding the open concepted kitchen.Menu was just a single page for lunch. There was also cocktails available on the drink menu.ThreeSome - ThreeSome ThreeSome ($8.50)char Siew, roasted pork, wontons, braised shiitake mushrooms, spring onions, fried shallotsThe roast pork was light and crispy in texture. The Char Siew which looked like braised pork belly, was a bit dry. The mushroom was fat and juicy but tasted a bit too much of vinegar. I like that there was crispy pork lards in it. The wantons were average.Cosmoy ($16)infused Pandan vodka, cranberry juiceReminded me of an adult version of ribena.Don't forget to add condiments such as crispy pork lard and Seng's infamous chilli sauce to the noodles. Help yourself to the flask of hot soup on the counter.Overall the food was not bad. The place was packed, but the turnover was fast
