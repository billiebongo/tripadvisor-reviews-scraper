This restaurant needs a revamp, it is too old for comfort dining even though the food is good.
The lady owner is definitely a big plus to this restaurant, very friendly.

Very good food and recommend the red wine chicken in addition to other well known dishes. Understaffed during our visit so service a bit slow.

Food was wonderful, every dish has a little surprise. Love the nostalgic ambience. However, a senior person may find it a challenge to climb up the rather steep flight of stairs to go to the restaurant. Not accessible for the wheelchair bound.

Singapura Restaurant
Cold crab - good (no photo)
Seafood soup with crab (crab is optional) - lovely soup
Pork ribs - nice
Oyster omelette - only about 10 oysters. Omelette is crispy rather than fluffy. Not bad.

this is a good choice for some chilli crab, the place is clean and the prices are ok albeit can get better prices around the area.

Read some reviews on random local foodie websites and decided to give it a go as it features Foo Chow cuisine. Our experience in simple notes:1. Not for elderly, dangerous stair ways, no lifts2. No service charges, however we are literally "liable" to pay for hefty towels, peanuts.3. Their signature cold crab is basically pre-prepared chilled steamed miserable small crab at $44 each. 4. Their dishes are overly charged. 6 pieces of pig livers costs $18. Fuzhou fishballs were machine-made. I can get better tasty ones in supermarket. 6 pcs biscuit sized prawn rolls costs $16+. Need not mention the rest.5. In serious need of revamp. With such menu prices, we can get better else where.Try at your own risk

We had dinner at this place specializing in Teochew/Hokkien cuisine and fell in love with the food. The food is flavourful and generous with ingredients. The environment is old-style, simple and clean. It is not crowded and so you will be able to find a table at most times. The dishes we had and would recommend to anyone: cold crab, prawn roll, Hokkien noodle (with fried pork lard cubes), fried pig liver with kailan and sweet yam paste for desert. It is a gem worth reliving

Singapura Restaurant is almost an institution, dishing out traditional Foochow food for the longest time.Must try dishes are the cold crab, red wine claypot chicken, prawn rolls, crispy duck and pork ribs.The restaurant retains its 1970s decor and atmosphere - a real blast from the past!

2nd visits to this place cause love to cold crab. Claypot tofu and the noodles were great. Disappointed with the duck as it was too tough and dry. It is an traditional restaurant and therefore don't expect very good service standard. The restaurant was not crowded and stood at the stairs area for at least couple of mins and no one noticed us at all till we approached one of the server. Overall still average .

We had a private room for twenty of us. Ordered most of their signature dishes. The steamed threadfin fish tail, cold crabs , crispy duck and honey porkribs were our favourites. They were fresh and precise. We were not blown away by the traditional Foochow dishes though. The red wine chicken soup was way too oily, noodles had piles of lard, and veg with fried pork liver was too dry. Foochow fishballs nothing to shout about. Service was not the best. My sis-in - law had food spilt carelessly on her by the only waitress serving our two tables. When another came in to help later, they were squabbling loudly while one of us was singing. In terms of price, ~ $50 - $60 pp which was decent for 11 dishes
