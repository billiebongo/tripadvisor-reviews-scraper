Am waiting for my f8sh and chips for now 55 mins and nothing yet to come. We were only the second group to arrive for lunch. Very slow service.

Food served is HALAL.Excellent service by the friendly staffs! I was amazed by the food. The bread served with the cheesy mussels was so soft and delicious. Love the onde-onde cake. We were too full so we brought it home and it was so good. U gotta try it. We got the truffle fries and the lychee cake complimentary of our lovely waitress Seha! Will definitely come back when we visit singapore! Thanks!

They have two outlets one at Dunlop Street and the other is at Bussorah Street. Both are halal food establishments. The foods served here are fusion of “East Meets West” same goes for its desserts. Some may not like the sound of it but all the food that I have tried are really awesome to my palates. The staffs are great host. This is our second time and we were always given free slices of cakes whenever we visit. I will be back to try out their humongous soup tulang lamb shank.Tip: They do not accept credit cards here, only Nets and cash payment
5
I went with a friend for her birthday dinner and it was busy night. Yet the staffs managed to get our orders, chatted with us and checked on us. The best is they got everyone including other guests to sing my friend Happy Birthday and we got free famous Onde Onde cake. The food is fantastic and in generous portion. The attention is so genuine and friendly. Definitely will come again and recommend it to all friends who visit Singapore who wants to taste delicious Asian Western fusion meals and wonderful service
5
It was great dining here with the family. Food appeals to all generations. The blend of western and asian taste is just so appealing. The service is tip top. Made us feel really welcome. They even gave some freebies for the elderly in our group. Fantastic and perfect service. Worth a revisit anytime. Ambience is warm and cosy. And you so have to try their cakes and the teh tarik sticky date. Oh my that taste is overwhelming! Super love it. Great great business ethics in this small restaurant. They will thrive if they continue their current way of appealing to their customers! Thanks team for your great servicw and kudos to the chef for the flavourful food! Pardon the half eaten food pics! Too delicious to wait
5
We went to the Bussorah St branch, the decor and ambience was fantastic. We ordered the Singapore Chilli Lobster and Beef Ribs Roti Kirai, they were amayyyyzing! But the durian pengat cake was the show stopper!The staffs were all attentive and friendly, they took time to check if everything is alright and asked for feedbacks.My first time there but definitely not the last
5
The cafe offers a cosy dining experience for all age groups. The owner is a friendly guy who takes the trouble to interact with everyone. The food selection includes a fusion of the East & West. Highly recommended is the Salted Egg Soft shell crab & Mudcrab Linguine and the Roti Kirai Beef Ribs. For desserts, must try the classic ondeh-ondeh gula melaka cake and the chocolate ovaltine cake. The foods are quite pricey but the portion is generous
5
Such a great atmosphere and an amazing customer service. A local favourite in the heart of manly. The foods are a bit pricey but the potion make the price worth it! I ordered the ondeh ondeh cake for dessert but due to stomach full I decided to cancel it. Didn't expect Hafiz (the owner of the café ) to pack it instead and give it to me as a complimentary for mother day treat. That is really nice of him to do that. Overall, everything was excellent. Will come back again to try out other dishes
5
Food and dessert was awesome!!place is a bit crampy especially in evenings where it could get really crowded!Recommended for Muslim tourist who are keen on new age fusion Singapore food and western recipes.Check out their brulee!!
5
A MUST TRY. The Fish ‘n’ Chips Tiga Rasa and the Asam Pedas Stingray Pasta was fantastic! The Classic Ondeh-Ondeh, Putu Piring and Red Velvet Speculoss cakes was ohh.. heavenly. Not only that, the roving waiters and waitress would always make sure your glasses are not empty (if you request for mineral water) and your plates not piling up on your table. Shoutout to Sis Nisa for the On-The-House Red Velvet Speculoos upon realising that the Ovalmaltine Cake which I ordered was sold out. Not to mention Mr Hafiz Alkhatib whom interacts with all his customers and making their visit a memorable one with a complimentary yummy Ondeh-Ondeh cake. Therefore, if you are looking for Western food but with a Malay twist, The Malayan Council is the perfect place for you. It’s a place to Talk, Makan and Chill. Cannot wait to come back for more. Bye

A friend recommended this place to me, went there for a double birthday celebration of my husband and brother whilst on our 5 day holiday in Singapore. The atmosphere was amazing, they had cute little notes here, the staff were very friendly, welcoming and chatty. We were really impressed by the service we received, they knew we were tourists on holiday and went that extra mile to make sure we had an enjoyable dinner. They gave us complimentary starts, explained the menu to us and recommended what to order and try. The food was amazing, especially the duck, the drinks were and the cake was amazing too. I was really happy with everything, 10/10 for food, service and general ambience of the place
5
My Friend made a reservation at this branch and we were both very impressed by both the quality of food and service! We ordered mussels for starters. They came with a full basket of bread and it was really yummy. For main courses, I had the chilli padi pasta and changed the meat from smoked duck to chicken. The portion of the pasta was huge. I would share a serving of the pasta the next time I visit. Y Friend has the Roti Kirai dish and changed the beef ribs to lamb. The taste was great as well. I loved the decoration in the cafe. Service was great, which probably explained the crowd. Keep in mind to make a reservation to ensure you have a table

Me and my wife had some time in hand and decided to check out some new lunch spots in town. In the end, we decided to go with Malayan Council at Dunlop Street after looking at all the hype on Instagram.So we went there. It's a hippie cafe kinda place. Recycled old stuff used as furniture and decor. Looks pretty cool actually. And we asked for the menu. When the menu came, the price was overwhelming! Almost $50 for a Roti Kirai meal!! Of course it comea with a lamb shank but very close to $50 for a meal in this hippie place? It's definitely too much. Eating in a proper steakhouse in a much more comfortable enviroment gives you the same price. In many other places , it would be cheaper. But I still bought it to give it a shot. It tastes good! But still not worth the amount.Since then, I never patronise the place again
4
A rather small and quaint and eclectic place to dine in.I ordered a cake - Ondeh-Ondeh Cake. It was recommended by a friend. The cake was awesome! A nice combination and layerring of the pandan sponge and gula melaka.I also had their chocolate cake with caramel filling. It was OOOOOOOOOO GOOD! Love it!You might have to be patient cos of the space and the number of customers. Will be back to try the food
5
Family mealTried something new todayFantastic family run Halal restaurant serving fusion foodExcellent serviceFood was good, portions were largeOrdered Malayan Wings, Assam Pedas Fish and Chips, and Lamb Rack Lontong GorengBut the highlight is definitely the cakes and dessertsNot cheap in a way, but the desserts are worth a visitMust try the Ondeh Ondeh cakeWe also had Teh Tarik Sticky Dates Pudding and Durian Creme Brûlé

An anniversary dinner last night with my wife of 21 years brought us to The Malayan Council for desserts. The place was a little tight but the fellow dinners (except for one loud person) were discreet and soft spoken. The decor was very imaginative and brings a fresh touch to old school ideas. Malayan Council brought new beauty out of wooden crates, old Singer sewing machine stands, and even primary school desks, as dining tables.Service by a new but seasoned serving staff was warm and yet professional. Uncle Bob recommended the desserts and even suggested an appropriate pairing of sparkling drink with our two desserts. He was spot on!! The kitchen service puzzled us with a rather late serving of our simple desserts, but kindly made it up with much smiles, and even a complimentary piece of cake for our anniversary. The onde-onde cake is superb, with a slightly substantial cake sponge (done like how proud stay-home mums would have, in the '70s), but packed with crunchy gula melaka/jawa (palm sugar). Not overly sweet, this dessert would have done well in itself, but the vanilla ice cream added a creamy accompaniment with every bite. My wife's favourite was the Durian Pengat cake. Being Indonesian Chinese by origin, the pengat I am used to, has a more santan (coconut cream) feel to it. The durian in this case, was nicely textured and not reduced to a yucky paste. Instead, the fibrous textures of durian layered in a cake very unlike the light Japanese chiffon of today, was a great blend. Next time we visit, whether here or in the soon to be opened Bussorah Street branch, I will surely head for the fusion mix menu which celebrates Western and Malay culinary gems. Being proudly Singaporean myself, this great Halal restaurant, ought to be visited by folks from every race and creed! Bravissimo Malayan Council!! All the best to your new opening! You are a brave testament of how new beauty is created out of age old traditions

They're a cosy gem that always superseded our expectations. one of Singapore great halal finds (Muslim owned) moderately priced, considering their portions its a real value for money.Always greeted with such a warm welcome, always fast, and if not too busy their boss/owner/chef (same guy) might even warm up to you and even will personally take in the order himself. Im a sucker for personal touch, always wins.I don't even know what to recommend. My personal most favourite has always been the kacangpool. Even so we are always game to try any other new menu or of what we have yet to try. So far they have yet to disappoint us. Food wise, I am always impress and satisfied.and YES they have the BEST Onde-onde cake in SINGAPORE.I have other favourite finds but theirs is still THE BEST to me lah.They're located in one of the old and small shop houses, and although the space on level 1 is a little cramp, they are still comfortable and cosy we're ok with it. Level 2 has a much better space (nope no lift) and better lighted, and its where their desserts are made (the lovely smell when they're baking... with glass windows for us to watch and drool while they do their magic) however the steep steps climbing up means a scary steep flight down and after a heavy meal, I got jelly knees. The level 2 is definitely not for high heels or the weak knees & especially not for elderly
5
First impression of The Malayan Council is a quaint & charming restaurant that dishes out a fantastic array of interesting fusion foods - savoury & sweet. They have seatings downstairs & upstairs.My family of 4 came to have a birthday dinner here and were so happy with the warm, friendly, professional and attentive service. We made a reservation and was brought to our table by a waiter who told us most politely about the specials & soup of the day. Throughout our dinner we were attended to most efficiently. We were glad to know that the restaurant is positive to receive any feedback in order to improve themselves & to meet customer expectations.We ordered the special Kobe Salai & Laksa Johore, Salted Egg Chicken Pasta & Salmon in Cream Sauce. Every dish was super tasty & full of flavour! Having learnt that it was my son's birthday, they sent to our table a generous slice of an Ovalmaltine cake with a lighted candle & staff along with other customers sang the birthday song for my son. What a lovely & thoughtful gesture! My family had a relaxed and happy birthday dinner. Will definitely be coming back to taste more of the food & desserts in the menu.When we left, my family knew that The Malayan Council has a special place in our hearts

At first we thought it was a bit pricey but when the food came and wow the portion is huge. Worth the price. Just that the cakes took so long to be served. Otherwise thumbs up!
5
Amazing Lychee drink, refreshing for $6.50 a cup, perfect drink for humid sunny Singapore. The cakes look so gorgeous, will be back to try them, authentic Halal cakes and cafe. I wonder how did I missed this place previously. The cafe has a 3rd floor seating area and bakery, Not advisable to climb up if you are scare of heights.
4
First.. Food here is in Asian style, malay fusion style. I order their menu of the day, a laksa johor and black seed Cola drink. The laksa johor is super awesome, thick broth with santan. Love it! It have scallops and a big deep fried tiger prawn. The environment is calm with old school music. Good place for a small gathering with family and friends. Clean. It is good place for work too if you need a quiet corner. Price of food.. It cost me SGD40++ for a meal here. Judge from the quality of food and service, it worth the money. Ohh.. Forgot to mention, they did give a free scoopof vanilla ice cream and a slice of cake. Too bad I am too full to finish them.
5
I went here after dinner as I we had heard about their great cakes and it was well worth the trip to little India on a crowded weekend. Definitely one to put on the regular list when you want some great tasting cakes with a slight Malaysian twist
5
Brought my mum here on 5th Aug to celebrate her birthday. This is my third time here & it never disappoints! Special thanks to Hafiz who handled my reservation & provided us with excellent service from the start to the end of our visit! He even got all the patrons to sing my mum a bday song! I specially reserved the durian creme brulee for my mum because it's her favourite fruit & Hafiz went one step further as to pack her a complimentary durian cake! Needless to say, my mum enjoyed her celebration & the kids & hubby enjoyed their meals too. Will definitely be coming back for more

We had dinner there on a Saturday night, the place only got more packed around 8pm (after we were in). Tables were limited at the ground floor, the 2nd level was much spacious but you've gotta climb up the high steep stairs before you can enjoy the higher level. Stairs not recommended for elderly or those with injuries, really steep!Drinks - Our coconut cooler ($6.50) came as a whole coconut instead whereas the mango mint cooler ($7.50) came in a glass with mango bits. Misleading menu, the coconut cooler should be renamed coconut juice instead. However, the coconut was really amazing with a lot of coconut flesh in it!Roti kirai beef ribs ($39) -One of their speciality and MUST ORDER! Tender and flavorful ribs, spiciness and amount of sauce just nice. The roti kirai came with some spicy sauce as well, but the little portion of rich sauce can never soak up the large chunk of roti. Perhaps a larger portion and less rich sauce would be better. Rendang pasta - Special for the day, which should actually be rendang pasta with beef slices on top. The pasta actually comes with some seafood in it, and the beef slices were just placed on top without rendang flavor. Delicious and spicy but somehow the flavors of the beef and pasta doesn't blend well enough, seems like 2 separate dishes put together.Lamb lontong -Again similar issue with the beef rendang, lontong taste well on its own, rich and spicy. 4 lamb ribs in total, cooked separately and placed on top of the lontong. Appreciate the huge and tasty portion of food but it doesn't fuse together.Angus ribeye masak merah ($37) -Option of truffle fries or rice. Masak merah sauce tastes too tangy with tomato sauce, not spicy enough to bring out the heat. Fries can do better, ribeye just normal.Desserts - Ondeh ondeh cake ($8), sticky date pudding ($9.50), putu piring cake, durian cake. Whole cake prices goes from $68-$78. The sponge from the cakes were light and fluffy, portion size was large. Ondeh and putu piring both were filled with gula melaka, however not overall sweet. Durian cake was really good, the paste tastes legit and thick. However, there was too much white cream with it, making it too rich. All cakes come with the same vanilla ice cream, which doesn't had much significance to the flavor of the cake (probably the cake is better on its own). Sticky date pudding comes with Thai milk tea ice cream that surprisingly don't taste overly sweet but had a thick cream taste. The date pudding is pretty normal though, not much of a date flavor. The staff's were really friendly, trying to engage all of the customers in small talk while serving. Constant ice water refill and pretty efficient service for the food. Our cakes too a long time to come though (20 mins) not sure why too. The food is worth a try even though it is not cheap, portion sizes are crazily huge, enough to share and save your tummy space for the delicious fluffy cakes!

Visited it with a large group of friends, staff made the effort to interact with everyone making all feel at home.Food was decent, fusion of asian and western cuisine. Huge portions for each main course.Dessert was the highlight of our visit! The ondeh2 cake is to die for along with many others!Parking is a hassle though if you are driving. Suggest you park at Sim Lim Tower across the road
5
Introduced by a family member. Wasn't sure what to expect but I must say this is definitely the place to go. The portion is big for Asian norm which is great. The food was fusion between East and West. It's tasty and awesome.We were greeted warmly by the owner who made our visit comfortable. He was also very generous. It's a great place to hang out. I almost ordered everything on the menu. The cakes were to die for. We got almost every cake there and it was all sooo good
5
Loved the ambience of this cosy little restaurant near Little India. As soon as you step through the door, you're made to feel very welcome. There are quirky quotes all over and the decor is rustic. Make sure you go with an empty stomach. The serves are big and the cakes are to die for. My favourite dish would be the beef ribs with roti kirai. The meat was extremely tender and just fell off the bone. The dishes are all Malay/Western fusion and very tasty.For dessert, we had the onde-onde cake, durian pengat cake and bandung lychee cake. All yummy and flavoursome. Would have liked to try the other cakes but there was no more room in our tummies. A customer had a birthday and we were all asked to join in singing 'Happy Birthday' to her. Fantastic place

The Malayan Council's alternative moniker - T(alk) M(akan) C(hill) - embodies the warm, laid-back and generous spirit of the establishment. Stepping into the space during this Hari Raya Puasa season, you can experience a sense of commune amongst all present. Its valiant attempt to contemporize familiar Malay cuisines could gain some fans from the uninitiated... And certainly a worthy introduction for overseas friends. However, the food would need greater convincing for the discerning local. What really stood out is the imbued gotong royong community life by each T.M.C folk. Their hospitable selves are especially evident when different group of diners were easily coaxed to break into a rousing birthday song for a complete stranger... And not forgetting the birthday cakes compliment of the chef-owner. Kudos for their authentic friendliness.
5
Friendly and cosy restaurant which makes you feel at home immediately upon entering. The Roti Kirai Beef ribs is to die for. The meat just melts away from the bone.
For desserts, the Ultimate Lopez and The Classic Ondeh-Ondeh cake is to die for.
4
Nice fun atmosphere coupled super friendly staff and generous tasty food. Make reservations to avoid having to wait for available table.
4
It's a cozy little corner tucked in a quaint little shophouse. The dishes served are pretty unique and not something you can get anywhere else. Portions are pretty big! We had to make a pre-order of our food perhaps due to the Muslim fasting period, but our orders didn't arrive on time and our Muslim friends were pretty famished by the time it arrived. Food's good and the late orders were pretty much made up by the good staff service, smiles all around, and a complimentary dessert (which tasted pretty awesome!)

This is quaint little cafe where malay food meets western food. The food combination was rather wierd but it was tasty & flavourful. We dined in today during lunch hour & there wasn't any crowd, its Monday. We had a chance for a quick chat with the staff, Hafiz (not sure if he is the owner). He is approachable & he is ready to accept constructive feedback. A little advise before dining in, come in with an EMPTY BELLY or skip the appetizer cos the main course portion is huge (american size), definitely a bang for your buck. Makan sampai senak kau!! The appetizers like Truffle Fries (by far the best we had) & Chicken wings are good for 4people. For desserts, we actually wanted to order their famous Ondeh2 Cake but they did not have it today . I love the Truffle Fries dips, i believe its mayonaise infused with lemongrass flavour. My Uncle had the Mudcrab Pasta, its a little dry cos the crab already absorbed the moisture/sauce but overall its good. He is not a big eater & he only manage to eat half of it. My Husband had the Kacang Pool with Angus Beef steak & poached egg. Beef is very tender & juicy. Kacang pool texture is very smooth & flavourful (i believe it has been pureed into a smooth consistency). I had the King Prawn Aglio Olio. Pasta is cook perfectly, al dente. Loads of garlic which i love. King Prawns have been deep fried with batter & flesh is not mushy like one of the reviewer mentioned on their FB. The muscles taste good but not chewy. Btw its spicy, you can ask them to go easy on the chili padi. I don't usually post restaurant reviews but The Malayan Council is worth the mention. Before anyone ask, im not paid to dine or give good review
5
I came to the shop to get a birthday cake... I bought their ondeh ondeh cake and it was so nice! A must try... No regret! Previous came to the shop without reservation (we didn't know we had to!) and couldn't get seats... So never get a chance to eat any of their dishes. Perhaps next time.
5
Nice cosy ambience, feels right at home immediately.. portions are big and good for sharing.. packed with flavor as well. Must order the ondeh ondeh cake and durian cake! Delicious, moist and filled with many layers of textures. Great service as well rendered by the staff who constantly check on our table.. very heartwarming that they will engage all the guests to sing bday song tgt for those celebrating their bday.. overall it was enjoyable.

I think Malayan Concil has the best ondeh ondeh cake, that leaves you craving for more. It is a simple cake of pandan chiffon layered with shaved gula melaka. If you eat it at the restaurant it comes served with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. (Ice cream not provide for take away). Because it is quite a rich cake, one serving is sufficient for two persons to share. It is one of those cakes that leave you thinking about it after a few days, especially if you have a sweet tooth. I have tasted other ondeh ondeh cakes elsewhere in Singapore and I think Malayan Council has the best so far because it has got its texture and crunchy gula melaka to perfection. Highly recommended!By the way, the Malayan council is a nice place for chill out. It is small but cozy and the service is friendly
5
Came here for desserts and coffee. The staff is very personal and makes me feel very welcomed. Introduced the specials and recommended items.I had the ondeh ondeh cake and chocolate Ovalmaltine cake. Both were oh oh oh so awesome. Definitely gonna come back real soon to try the rest.

I was there with my wife on 21st January, Saturday. I wanted to go to a hotel to celebrate our 14th wedding anniversary but she declined and wanted to try TMC as it will be her first and mine second. Fortunately it will be our last!!!While waiting for table as we were third in queue, I overheard a gentleman named Hafiz apologise profusely to a group of family seated outside explaining that their food were sent to a wrong table. I should have just leave but being a positive person I told myself that it would not happen to me. Well guess what...??? It did!!!We ordered : Cheesy Kupang, Malayan Wings, King Prawns Alio Oglio, Ondeh-Ondeh and Ovomaltine cakes. Cheesy Kupang came about 10mins WITHOUT our set of cutleries which took about 6 min to arrived after the food. As we were sharing we asked for side plates which only came together with the Alio Oglio pasta...BUT HEY WHERE'S THE MALAYAN WINGS??? We thought it will come later but until we finished our pasta it still did not appear. I then asked a server whom I believed is from Bangladesh. He hardly speaks basic English let alone understands it. So he came back and forth twice but we still cannot make out what they were trying to say. I then asked for the manager and up came Hafiz after 5-7 min or so. Hafiz then explained to us that the Malayan Wings was already item 86. I just sat there and was awed by the whole experience. Not only that there were 3 different groups who were celebrating birthdays and the two service staffs by chance neglected our table and the couple next to us. They also have got their food missed out!!! Not one thing that happened to our table BUT 3 THINGS...Oh yeah and the third was, despite him making these mistakes he brought out a complimentary cake after learning that we were there for a special occasion and asked those groups to sing a song for us!!! What was he thinking???!!!??? Was he doing service recovery or adding insult to injury???!!!??? It was more of the latter for me!!!The whole night was a total disaster to me thanks to TMC!!! POOR PLANNING POOR ORGANIZATIONAL SKILL POOR SERVICE RECOVERY POOR COMMUNICATION SKILL. I EXPECT A REPLY FROM THE OWNER AND ALSO I DID POST ON SOCIAL MEDIA FB. As you can see that I am still having a sour taste in my mouth til now

I dined here with 3 ladies and a baby. Very helpful staff - helped to carry the pram up to the third level. The stairs up were pretty steep - dangerous for older diners.Food was very pricey and average. Would not come back for the main dishes although serving size was big and the menu was imaginative. I had an iced latte which was average too. Couldn't taste any coffee in it despite asking for an extra espresso shot.However, we had the ondeh-ondeh and durian cake which were fantastic! Would definitely come back solely for the cakes
5
Love love loveee the ondeh2 cake! Super moist n not overly sweet. Ordered the big breakfast and I swear you probably need to share it. Staffs here are super friendly and pro-active. Ambience is cozy as well!
4
Made a trip down just to get their Classic Ondeh Ondeh cake.. Simply fantastic..they are generous with the gula melaka in between the layers.. And since we made a trip, why not try their Durian Pengat cake. Another choice we did not regret. Yummy!
5
Chanced upon this restaurant while thinking how to celebrate countdown 2016. Went in and order their special burger and chicken breast meat plus their oneh oneh cake. Their truffle fries are good and delicious!! I especially loved their cakes! Looks good and taste good! Will try their other cakes the next time! Although i am quite full after eating the mains but the cakes tempted me into taking it. While we were eating, other people saw the cakes and order the same as us. Other cakes also looks good! Please give it a try
5
This cafe is located near to little Indian and sim Lim tower, easy to find location and there are queue outside when we are there. Waiting time is not very long though and we get to sit on the first storey. We have ordered the ondeh ondeh cake and truffles fries. The serving is fast, the boss is very friendly as well and the portion is big. Waiter is attentive and will be around to top up water for everyone. Ondeh ondeh, as a traditional dessert, however did not expect that it can be combine into cake. The cake together with the ice cream, the gula melaka will not become too sweet and it will leave fragrance in your mouth for very long time. The fries is good and a lot. I will definitely be back to try out other dishes, highly recommended
3
Visited this place twice. The only thing consistent was the tasty ondeh-ondeh cake and the very slow and unfriendly service. To be fair, there is only ONE person that was friendly, I suspect he might be the owner. The other servers kept putting us off by waving their hands asking us to wait. No smile. Had to ask a few times to get table service. Food took FOREVER to be prepared. We were told to wait 15 mins for the burger. Half an hour later, someone came to tell us there is no burger patty. Presentation of the mushroom soup, burger, gado-gado salad and pasta was quite nice. But the presentation of the kachang steak was really unappetizing. Crab pasta smelled really fishy. Food was overall good. But nothing fantastic and on the pricey side. Very average. I think the ondeh cake is probably what's worth returning for. Utensils and water cups were pretty dirty. Had to wipe it a few times. I had to drink the oily water since it was impossible to get service and refill. I feel like I may return but at the same time I am unsure of this place
5
One of my colleagues recommended this restaurant for our Christmas lunch celebration after we did some volunteering at Willing Hearts in the morning. We were packing food for the poor and elderly at Willing Hearts and we also became hungry ourselves! Lol! The food here is halal fusion. Portions are large and we loved the food especially the cakes. When we first entered the restaurant, we were greeted by the wonderful and delicious aromas of freshly baked Pandan Ondeh Ondeh and Durian cakes. The bits of Gula Melaka and the Durian pulp in each kind of cake was heavenly!!! While having lunch here, we decided to continue our volunteering on a quarterly basis and follow up with lunch here after each session. Such is the power of motivation from the food in this restaurant. Lol! Will definitely be back soon
5
Heard and read so much about this reataurant. Made our first visit for a birthday meal today. First impression of place, cosy with simple deco and friendly staffs. Love the carrom board table - creative. We ordered mushroom soup, TMC Burger and smoke Duck chilli Padi linguine. Mind you, the portion is very generous and food is exceptionally delicious. Linguine sauce tasted like lemak chili Padi and for a non-smoke-duck fan, it tasted so good - well marinated and seasoned. Gosh!! Burger, no words to describe. If you think Fat Boys Burgers are yummzz...this is SUPER yummzz!!We were presented with TMC sticky date pudding as bday cake, which is sooo good. I can still taste the cake with ice cream in my mouth. Drool!. We didn't have space for the ondeh-ondeh cake, which you MUST try. Overall review, 5 ☆ for everything - place, food, staff and diners!! I will definitely visit again. Burp
4
This is the first restaurant we had our Lunch when we arrived in Singapore. The food is good but I think its a little bit pricey compare to the other restaurant nearby. This restaurant has few tables and it has AC . so perfect for the hot weather to sit inside this restaurant
5
If the thought of mixing pasta and kuah lemak cili api makes you cringe, then look away now. But I tell you what... It really works, well for me at least. I have honestly never tried anyting fusioned, till today. TMC is brave to take on this challenge, if you may, to dish out what seems like a recipe for disaster. But being a person who appreciates good local food, i find this welcoming. Yes, the food there seem overpriced but what you get are quality food from beyond your imagination.... and you don't actually put a pricetag on those. They pride themselves in having the best Ondeh2 cake and I don't blame them coz they are really worth whatever I paid for... The sticky dates cake with ice-cream was warm and superb. I wished i got to try the cempedak creme brulee.It must be really good considering it was sold out when I ordered them just after the lunch hour. Cafes come and go... I really hope TMC will be around for a long time and continuously coming up with brilliant fusion recipes
4
Warm n welcoming greetings, cozy atmosphere, nostalgic n fusionistic food, excellent food presentation & huge serving... Recommended to dine with an empty stomach... For the appetiser We tried fried chicken wings(Oops!! Forgot the name) it was nice, not that spicy... Wild truffle mushroom was fantastic... My partner isn't a sweet tooth person but you should definitely try of-the-menu dessert that we've had which is the Pengat Durian Cake, it's marvelicicious...
5
Went at night on a weekday. Tried both Ayam Panggang and Ondeh ondeh cake, both of them were superb and naise
5
I ordered the softshell crab pasta and it was delicious! Also the place itself feels cosy and service was fantastic - felt like we were having lunch in a friends living room :)
4
The abovementioned cake is.... ThE BOMB!!! Must try. You are advice to make reservations. AND DON'T COME TOO LATE ELSE YOU WILL MISS THE BOMB. While stock last.
5
awesome and huge portion of food. helpful staff to assist us on the selection of food.. the ondeh ondeh cake is the best
3
1st time tried dining here been wanting to come here quite sometime. I had Roti Kirai Beef Rib and my partner having Prawn Aglio Olio Pasta.

It is located right opposite dunlop mosque and it is a halal restaurant. Offers meal and desserts. Settings are unique and love their writings on board "we do not provide wi-fi, talk with one another please". A pleasant place to have chat and dine with friends and family. Their dessert is amazing. Must try ondeh-ondeh for all the tourist visiting singapore in this outlet. Had a great experience and humble reception and service:

I went to The Malayan Council with my family in August 2016 to celebrate my wife's birthday.Nobody was there to greet us when we first showed up, and had to walk into the indoor dining area from the outdoor patio to a room full of diners staring at us as we wait for service. Once the staff appeared, we were given our seats.The prices are extremely steep. We figured it's not always that we dine there, so why not. The entrees we had were brilliant. I still believe they were worth lesser, and if they don't lower their prices, returning customers will be reduced.The most disappointing thing was that our $9 mushroom soup happened to be Campbell's canned cream of mushroom. It was not even mixed in very well.So we received a slice of their ondeh-ondeh cake as a birthday gift. We both love it and highly recommend it

A must place to come for the Ondeh Cake.I've tried few of the food each time I came to this place, price is a bit too high but the meal portion is huge hence you may share with friends. It is a small place but they also have space upstairs if you come as a group.My one and only favorite is their Ondeh Cake which I feel that is too sweet but it is something that is very popular (aside from Fluff Bakery which always out of stock). I recommend to call first before you come as it too popular and it sold out very fast

The first thing served to me was the real shocker. There was an army of ants in my lychee cooler. Luckily I did not take a sip before my daughter saw the poor chaps in my drink. The waiter could just apologise smilingly... no sign of remorse!The dishes were rather luke fusion. I ordered a kacang phool with ribeye steak. Waiter asked me how I wanted the meat to be. He had trouble understanding what medium well is. When it came... it just tasted bland... also more like welldone. The kacang phool waa basically tasteless and the bread too soft. Didnt enjoy the meal at all! My son found the cili padi duck over spicy. The salmon was ok. The roti kirai was nice.An improvement over the way the meat was cooked would have gotten my good vote. Sadly, a tasteless steak just spoiled my taste buds, not forgetting the ant-sprinkled lychee cooler

The place is small. U need reservation and we got ourselves on the third floor dining area where Space is good and condusive. Apparently food came in an hour after ordering. Food served one at a time and starters came in after we almost finished our main dish.I feel that its overly priced over the ambience and slow service. We had beef ribs at $39 served with truffle fries and salad which was the only thing tht fits my palate.This place does fusion with excellent food blend. If only food had texture it would be perfect! The hummus was diluted and i felt cheated over it. The beef burger has too much coarse pepper and it affect the taste. The charcoal bun dont work well with it. I hope they improve on service and pay close attention to food tenderness and quality.The sweetess thing done was to sing birthday song for the birthday gal

Decided to try Malayan Council after reading a posting from a friend. There were lots of excellent review. Just a short comment... inside - the place is a little stuffy and I opted to sit outside...which is not a bad thing as you will be entertained by the radio from next shop. There were lots of people and I noticed that even for those who booked had to wait for their table. The malay chap is friendly and tried his level best to accomodate all customers with his funny jab. Food wise...i tried the beef rib kirai. The beef itself lacked taste but complimented by its gravy. The ondeh cake was good and its their best seller. All in all think its not a bad place for a fusion halal place...

Recommended by a friend's son....this is a gem of a place...located in little India area and within walking distance from rochor mrt stationThe desserts are the most popular items.It's fusion food with their fish and chips spread with assam pedas (spicy chili) paste. So it take some getting used to.Their desserts are also a fusion of Asian ingredients with their ondeh ondeh cake being the most popular it seems....and it was delicious

First time visit & was very impressed with the service & deco. Staff very friendly & food recommendation was spot on. We try the salted egg yolks linguine with soft shell crab & ondeh ondeh cake.... We loved both !! The ice lemon tea was very refreshing with fresh mint taste & finally we felt welcome & wanting to come again to try more foods on the menu. The only negative is, the foods are a bit pricey but the potion make the price worth it!

Checked the place out based on a friend's recommendation. Desserts were rate excellent but was disappointed that it didn't meet my expectations. - Ondeh ondeh cake used preserved shaved coconut - lopes cake was layered with too much whipped cream- Dinner for 2 person would easily total up to S$100 (incl mains, drinks & dessert)- entire shop smells of truffles. If you are not a fan, do request for table outside. - service was slowOverall experience, average & would need a lot of great reviews for us to go back.

Was craving for Ondeh-ondeh cake so I went all the way to this cafÃ©. Before I took the cab, I called to check if that particular cake is available. The guy who answered said yes. I further asked if I could get the whole cake. He said I am not able to because to purchase the whole cake as I need to book at least 4 working days. Fair enough, I then asked if he could prepare 6 slice of Ondeh-ondeh cake and get it packed. He said purchases can only be made over the counter and no reservation allowed. When I reached there, the guy who answered my call happened to be at the counter. I told him that I want to purchase 6 slice of Ondeh-ondeh cake. He then checked his stocks opened the fridge twice and asked a lady before telling me that I could only purchase 2 slice of Ondeh-ondeh cake because the rest is reserved for the dining in customers. He told me alternatively I can purchase Lopez cake. Angry and frustrated because he did not tell me earlier, I still bought 2 slice of Ondeh-ondeh cake and 2 slice of Lopez cake but for sure is that I will never come back again

We were here because we were intrigued by the Asian-Western cuisine, and we were not disappointed.All 7 of us tried something different. My favourite had to be the smoked duck cili padi fettucine. Pretty succulent duck slices. The beef rib with roti kirai was equally good -- really big serving and a big price tag to match. If you are a small eater, consider sharing. My husband ordered steak with masak merah gravy and gado2 salad. Don't expect the same kind of gravy you get with your typical ayam masak merah, or your typical gado2. This is quite different. The gado2 salad was rather spicy to me (and I like spicy food), and the meat was unfortunately a little tough, not juicy. We ended our meal with dessert: the ondeh2 cake was yummy, but I enjoyed the lopes cake more. There is limited seating, so it's best to make reservations. Kudos to Hafiz for making us feel welcomed.We'll be back

Generally I'm one of those people to go to places that are recommended by my friends. So after listening to 3/5 of my friends talking abt this place, I knew I had to check it out. I had one of their steak specials and my partners had their pastas. All I can say is that they make really spicy food, seriously. Dinner party started sweating after about 3 bites, this is after telling them during the orders "not so spicy please". My steak special wasn't too spicy tho, but the meat was tough instead of the tender sort I desired. After our dinner, we were served an ondeh ondeh cake (also one of their specials). Lo and behold, it immediately made up for the tough steak and the ultra spicy pastas! I would honestly bring my friends from abroad here, maybe not for a meal but definitely to try the Dessert!Top tips - 1) make reservations ( this place gets crowded during dinners)2) there is parking along the side of the road but during e evenings, lots are scarce! So Park down the road and walk a little!3) order the ondeh ondeh cake, I reckon 4) if you can't take spicy food, let them know and make sure you emphasise you can't handle it. Thank you to waiter who made our dinner, he served us an ondeh2 cake on e house to compensate for my tough steak.

Both me & my wife chose to have our lunch here @ TMC few days ago.. we decided on their cheesy kupang (baked mussels with mozarella cheese in lemon butter sauce) as a start to share with.. now for me, if i went to any other cafes/eateries & if this similar dish were on the menu, i'll definitely ordered a serving of it, & most of the time the dish were either too creamy or the sauce are too bland, & it left me felling full even before i finished up the dish.. well, not with TMC cheesy kupang, it makes u going for more..Next were our mains, chicken parmigiana serve with truffle fries & salmon with ravioli.. i have to say they're very generous with their serving portions, there's barely any empty space on the plate of my chicken parmigiana.. i started to wonder could it be another struggle to finish up my plate, turns out i "won the battle" at ease.. even my wife finished up hers in no time (she normally can't finish up the meal if the portion's too much)..We ended our meal sharing one of their well known dessert, the cempedak creme brulee or custard base cempedak (jackfruit) bits topped with burnt sugar crystallised.. & as expected, it never fails me with it's presentation & taste.. Service wise, was prompt & efficient, we were served by a guy who's friendly & keeps on checking if we're all good throughout our meal.. ambience, well, such a cool & hip place to dine in with who ever we likes to, with their unique decors.. in all, only two words to summarise my dining experience here, simply superb..

Just woke up from a food coma caused by dining at The Malayan Council last night... Seriously, it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time! The chicken wings doused in kicap chilli padi was finger-licking awesome, the assam pedas fish & chips with truffle fries was delicious and the salted egg pasta with a generous serving of real crab meat was downright amazing... But what really took the cake was, literally, the ondeh-ondeh cake!! The texture of the slightly crunchy gula melaka with the softness of the pandan cake topped with the lightness of the coconut shavings was simply mind-blowing. I swear, never have I tasted a cake this heavenly before! Oh, and did I mention all our wonderful dishes were served on a glass-covered carrom board?? Brought back such great childhood memories! And I just loved swinging my feet on the pedal of the upcycled sewing machine table base! The service was superb too! Our glasses of complimentary water were filled consistently even without us asking for it. One of the staff even took the time to check with us if everything was okay. Everyone was friendly & always smiling. I can't wait to come back & try all the other stuff on the menu
