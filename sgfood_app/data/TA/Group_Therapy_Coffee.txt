A nice cafe in the Kantong centre.
I had a great latte and a blueberry muffin. There is however a good menu with the usual breakfast/brunch favourites.
The guy next to me was devouring what looked like a beautiful pancake stack with maple syrup!
4
Try truffle fries! Generous serving and delicious shoestrings!
They serve good coffee, too - my favorite is latte.
4
Cafe has a good breakfast menu with variety. They serve nice coffee too. Cafe is nice to chill and hang out.
5
The vibes were great and the food was awesone as always. Its has always been crowded so its a good sign.
Food was never a disappointment and looking to be back again :)
4
A great place for catching up & yummy food. Had the pumpkin pancakes for the 3rd time now and it never disappoints!
4
Lovely casual dining location in the heart of the east. Lovely breakfast options and casual atmosphere. Almond latte coffee is a must try!!
4
Group therapy has a rather extensive menu and at pocket friendly prices too! Highly recommend their breakfast plates, you can never go wrong with those :-)
4
I love their all day breakfast menu and they have design your own which is really good for me. Love the truffle fries and waffles.
5
Came here for new year day brunch and it was enjoyable. Ordered the hash and eggs, and the skinny egg Ben.. It was so good and delish!
4
A small cafe packed with people and the queue is never ending. Breakfast spread is generous, love their soft scrambled eggs on the toasted brioche. Beef shank stew is very well stewed for beef lovers. Highly recommended for friends and families who enjoy all-day breakfast and coffee
4
We visited during lunch on a weekday, and it was relatively quiet - there were only 2-3 other tables besides us. The food was good enough.
4
The cafe was busy but service was rather prompt. We received our orders rather quickly and the food was delicious. Will definitely return!
5
I had the pumpkin pancake. It was super good. Delicious. Big portion. The pancakes go well with the salmon slices. Egg benedict very well done to perfection. 5 stars!
5
We had brunch at group therapy and the variety of food was wonderful for us. The staff were all patient and helpful!
5
The pancake stack is simply delicious, with the honeycomb really bringing the dish together. Mushroom egg white scramble also recommend.
4
Nice casual homely restaurant tucked in a corner at Katong V near the cold storage. Can be crowded on weekends. Tasteful food and decent portion size
4
Location is at Katong V, first level, and it has ample open carpark parking spaces. Easy to locate as well. The lighting of cafe was nice and cosy, with sufficent space between each different tables. Not very cramped, so its good for couples and small groups of friends.
5
Pretty small place with about 10 - 15 tables, but the atmosphere was pleasant and the service was great!Hashbrown with smoked salmon came with baby spinach as side salad, which was fantastic. Coffee and food were tasty and at very reasonable prices, compared to many other brunch places these days. I think every item on the menu was <$20 each. Plus point that you can use the Chope app to make reservations so you don't have to wait in line.
4
Excellent breakfast options and we were repeat customers. The "sunny side up" was a favourite, as was their "ham and cheese croissant with eggs", delicious. The kids enjoyed the pancakes both with fruit and the chocolate chip variety. Their chai was really lovely and I particularly enjoyed the roasted almond latte. So nice. A little bit on the small side but, the staff are excellent at finding spots. Brilliant and friendly service. Well done
4
Nice and quiet during the week, other reviewers have noted it is busy at the weekend. The juice was good and the food was nice, although I think the spinach pastry was heated up and not freshly made. No wifi, if that sort of thing is important to you. To find the cafe, you have to go through the Cold Storage inside the Katong V building
3
A nice little cafe with a maximum sitting of 50. Coffee is great here and the Pecan pie is tasty. Setbacks : Service is average and this place is a little small. 这是一间不错的小咖啡厅，室内容量50人.咖啡香浓可口，核桃派美味。缺点：服务一般，座位缺少。
1
Nothing great but hype and price on high side. Service is normal overall Not worth to eat on regular basis...Maybe on anniversaries...
1
Used to be a big fan of gt back in duxton, didn't expect such a big drop in quality and standards. Will not go back again
4
the pumpkin pancakes were so good, best pancakes ive had in a long time. superbly fluffy and fragrant. and best part is that it's topped with two beautiful poached eggs
3
Food is ok but not spectacular ...Ambience is so so. Service is ok. Can try their pies if you are around here.
4
Went down for a late lunch with a friend. Tucked away inside the Village Hotel Katong, I was not even aware that this place existed until my friend took me there. For a late Sunday afternoon, the place was fully crowded. We tucked into a waffle with maple syrup and a ravioli to share accompanied by cups of warm coffee. The waffle was a definite winner! Service was quick and the experience was good :) Great for a coffee date with friends
4
Popular cafe in the basement oh Katom Village. Excellent breakfast with great taste and fast to the table. Big tick for the kitchen crew. The big breakfast is my preferred choice. Drink service is slow and when busy becomes confused my latte was adorned with nice art but was bitter. I asked for sweetener but wait staff forgot. Pricing is reasonable with $18 for big breakfast and $5 for latte. This cafe has great potential if the front of house staff are more organised
4
Had a great time at group therapy. The coffee latte with coconut oil is always good. We ordered scramble eggs with bacon & berry pancakes. Scramble eggs are nicely done, not overcooked. Bacon is a little hard. The pancakes with salted Carmel sauce is good and not too sweet. The service staff are very friendly and helpful. They are fast at clearing tables and take every effort to make us feel at home. A nice place for catch up, with good lighting and spacious seating. Thank you group therapy for a great start for Saturday.

You could only find this either by mistake, or by someone taking you there. It is tucked away at the back of Katong V shopping mall. You either walk around to the back of the mall and enter that way, or you have to walk through the Fairprice Finest SM to get there!I enjoy coming here, but it is a bit on the pricey side, and they sadly don't cater for my vegan-ish diet here at all. I can only have the hot oats (so good), but their coffee is great and they do have soy milk.Warning: gets v crowded at times with Mama's and their strollers.A lovely Filipino called Clyde and his team run the place well, even under pressure, they do a great job. Thanks guys

My wife has been here several times and has always raved about it, so this morning she brought me for breakfast and I have to admit she is spot on. LOVE THIS LITTLE PLACE. The staff greets you with a big smile as soon as you walk in, which is unusual for Singapore... they give you the menu and no rush to order your food. The coffee roast is among the best in Singapore and they have some pretty delicious and unique flavours such as coconut Latte made with coconut milk and roasted almond latte. We ordered the peanut butter waffles which comes with banana and honey. It must be at least 1,000,000 calories but the awesome taste is worth every inch that will put on your waist line. I ordered the skinny eggs ben, and changed the eggs from poached to scrambled, and also got a side of back bacon. The scrambled eggs with done perfectly and the back bacon was well done and crispy the way I love it. A little bit pricey as the breakfast for two of us was almost $60. Not a place that we will come several times a week but this will be our new regular weekend place to go. Definitely a must try
4
Good coffee and desserts! and a great place to hang out with family and friends on a weekend afternoon!
4
A cosy and quaint café which serves up a simple yet effective array of culinary delights as well as a decent selection of coffee and desserts!
An enjoyable meal on all fronts!
4
Trust me on this. Order the Pumpkin pancakes. You won't be sorry.
Food is good. Coffee is also nice.
I wish there was WiFi, if so, I'd spend more time there.
3
We just ordered coffees during a short break on Saturday. I personally drank roasted almond hot.
Coffee taste is just okay. Ambience is good and free water.
5
Best breakfast near Tangan Pagor MRT, stayed at Carlton City Hotel and this made a nice change, can get busy at peak times but lovely food & drink, service with a smile.
Popular with locals and it's somewhat hidden, blink and you will miss it.
5
I go here probably once a week for breakfast. I like that you can create your own plate because I have dietary requirements and this works for me. Yummy!
4
A place where friends or family can gather over meal or desserts. The shepherds pie is still great as usual. Cross opposite and the sister's cafe Scoop Therapy is. It's ice cream range is great and unique eg: salted egg yolk. The waffle is crispy on the outside and it's only $11.90 for 3 flavours. The ice cream bomb is equally nice with earl grey tea sandwich between the choux pastry.
5
We visited the branch at Katong V, hidden away in the heart of the East Coast. Coffee is always good, apple pie and ice cream was delicious and service is always delivered with a friendly smile. Menu is good and varied, a tad on the expensive side but the quality is there so worth the little extra
4
We had Coffees, pancakes (a large serve), muffins with eggs and our spend was $30. Coffee at $5/cup and tea is similar. A pleasant enough atmosphere although internal ie. inside a small shopping mall. Anyway, it seemed like a cheaper/better breakfast option than the breakfast on offer at our nearby hotel. The quality of the food was excellent
4
Nothing fancy, but a solid, comfortable, little cafe with high quality coffees, snacks, and breakfast plates. I like to head there mid-morning to get some work done, and I'll frequently have meetings there when I'm in town since I often stay at the hotel just above
4
Food and coffee is nice. Pretty wide variety on the menu. Acoustics of this place could be improved.
3
Attached to the Village Hotel Katong. Not bad coffee, but to me a coffee shop that doesn't open until 9 is pretty useless.
4
Very good food and drink at a reasonable price. I particularly enjoyed the craft beer. The only downside for me was that they did not accept Visa, nor MasterCard, so we had to pay cash.
4
The cafe was small but cozy. They served pretty good breakfast. Coffee was ok. Staffs were friendly. Serving was fast.
5
food was all delicious and nicely presented. shepherd's pie was baked w a little crisp on top. beef cheeseburger tasted healthy too. nobody on a friday night. sweet date.
2
Coffee is okay... Not great. Food is average
Coffee has a bitter aftertaste and the food seems okay, not for the healthier population... I would not really go back to be honest. Seating was also uncomfortable.
4
Great brunch outing at the popular group therapy coffee. Love the mint mocha which combines the sweetness from chocolate with a nice hint of mint. My coconut latte had an unexpected interesting fragrance and taste to it which was quite nice. The eggs benedict was awesome and covered with a blanket of hollandaise on perfectly poached eggs. Their big breakfast as their name suggest is big and was more than enough for the glutton in me
3
First visit to the place. When I told the staff that I've made reservation under Chope, I was given a perplexed look. I had to find the menu myself. Ordered sunny side up with ham, cheese, avocado on toast. Surprised to find that the cheese was cold & grated! (Was expecting a melted one). Average & overpriced food, not so helpful service. Normal ambience. Wouldn't consider going back

Weekdays brunch are the best! This cafe was more than 80% packed even on a normal Wednesday afternoon. Impressive! My partner and I ordered small portions for a quick brunch. 1. Poached Eggs - egg and salmon was delicious but the thick toast was a little disappointing. The bread was tasteless (i know it shouldn't have a taste per se but it was too bland compared to the delicious spread. And because it was thick, it took alot of taste out of the dish. 2. Pumpkin soup - this was thick, smooth and delicious. Thumbs up. Portion was a tad small though for the price. That was all we had and i wished i tried the cakes. The prices range from $3+ onwards, reasonable for the looks of it. Will come back and try other food options for sure
4
Group Therapy has always been one of my favourite brunch places in Singapore. Not only are the portions sizable, but the price of the dishes are very reasonable compared to some other brunch places in Singapore (typically less than $20). It is also very easy to get parking there and parking is cheap. I usually get the salmon with hashbrowns (the hashbrowns are divine) and the coffee is very good as well. Service is efficient but nothing fantastic. One disappointment was last Sunday when I tried the cheese omelette with bacon (something relatively new on the menu I believe). While the bacon was very well done (please note it is not your typical crispy bacon so it is a matter of preference), the eggs were very disappointing. I could not taste any cheese in my omelette. I think they might have forgot to put it in. Nonetheless, I will still return and just stick to my usual order from now on
4
- Good Coffee, Indifferent service.
- Decent cakes and scones, Over-priced Food.
- Easy Parking.
- Try the Piccolo Latte.
5
Had breakfast here yesterday and we liked it. Love the food and coffee, the environment too. It's a small boutique café :) Will come back again when I'm in that area
4
We visit a couple of times on our visit. The shepherds pie is so tasty & the chicken stew in a bread bun was just as tasty. Simple tasty food. So glad we found it.
4
Busy, family friendly cafe with good coffee and good food. Huge plates at reasonable prices for Singapore.
4
The shepherd's pie is seriously damn delicious. Homemade style and beef filling is well stewed. The fried chicken wing looks good but it's a disappointment as it's too dry.
4
Group Therapy is another regular haunt for weekend family brunch. Brunch menu with a good range of fry up. The food is not pretentious - just good honest down to earth made with fresh ingredients. Decent coffee and a rather interesting (but too sweet) Spiced Chai Latte
3
We have walked past here a few times and decided to give it a try for a Saturday lunch. It is self Service and therefore no gst or service but still quite expensive. My partner has spinach role which was small and not homemade and expensive at 12 dollars. I had fish and chips. Fish over cooked but great chips. Coffee was however very good. There are better places to go locally.
4
My wife and I had lunch at the Group Therapy CafÃ© yesterday - going back again today ! I had Cuban Hotdog which was pulled pork, pickles ,mustard, salad and French fries - excellent ! My wife had a Croque Madame which included very lean bacon and ham ! - also delicious ! I tried their Coed Beniaka craft beer, brewed in Japan from sweet potatoes - a tad pricey, but well worth it ! Always found the place very busy, which speaks volumes for its popularity.The one downside - it doesn't take either Visa or Mastercard
2
We were very disappointed by this place that seemed to have good appeal and reviews. After a Sunday brunch there, here's what we can say - dark place at the back of Katong V shopping mall, below average food, pre-cooked dishes for the usual not-so-cheap price. There are many nicer places for the same price range in the area
4
Tucked away in the quiet basement of katong V, I was surprised to see so many people there for brunch on polling day. I had salmon avocado sandwich, which had generous portions of both salmon and avocado, as well as a side of green salad which I love. The sandwich is nice and very filling. At $12 nett, I would say that it is value for money, by the Singaporean cafe standards. My friend tried the hash browns with salmon ($14) the hash brown is average, but there is a generous and filling portion of smoked salmon. I also had the egg yolk fries ($8)That was terrible and a disappointment. I was expecting the egg yolk sauce to be something like what is in Liu sha bao, but it was not. There is also no distinct taste to the egg yolk(not sweet, not salty), though there is a hint of its flavour. You can see pieces of egg yolk in the bowl of fries but we can barely taste anything. I should have went for truffle fries instead!Coffee is mediocre. I think the milk in the cappuccino overpowered the flavour of the espresso because it was not very robust. I wouldn't pay for it again. Overall, staff were prompt to collect our plates. But since they do not tax us for service charge, do not expect the servers to do much for you- you have to help yourself to the extra utensils and plain water.I would recommend this place because of the price. It does not have GST or service charge, which makes it a lot cheaper than other cafes that are sometimes reputed for good coffee, mediocre food at exorbitant prices.
4
Great coffee,service and food .We had numerous breakfasts, lunches and dinners at this quaint cafe located on the lower level of Katong Village.
5
The coffee is pretty good. The relax atmosphere in contrast to the hectic shopping centre across the road makes it a nice place to relax have a coffee have a bite. The place doesn't charge tax or service fee so it's really affordable.
5
One of these places that thrives through word of mouth as Katong V is never very busy. Interesting menu, food is good and even my kids enjoy coming here.

Just returned from breakfast at Group Therapy. Googled and sounded good. It was only just around the corner from our hotel, which was handy. The cafÃ© is relatively small, but had a pretty good vibe about it. We got the next available table fairly quickly, then ordered.There was a good range of coffees. The coffee was nice. The meals, hmmm. I had the pumpkin pancake with ham, eggs and hollandaise. Was large (probably too large), but a bit too sweet. My wife had hash brown, but wanted with eggs, smoked salmon and avocado . The order was messed up, and she didn't get the eggs and salmon. Rather than take it away and cook the additional and replate, they left the plate on the table.So, I ended up eating mine and she got hers after I'd finished. I ordered another coffee, but the plate and the 3 coffee cups/mugs remained on the table, even though staff walked passed a number of times empty handed.All in all, a bit disappointing. Staff probably need to be more observant
5
I visited their branch at Katong V as recommended by my friend who stays in the area. I must say that I had a pleasant unpretentious lunch. Ordered their pasta and coffee (my favourite comfort food) and I must say they were absolutely great with good value for money. The interior was quite simple and ambience was nice. During the day the place was full-packed though
5
Such a great find and we have returned here several times now in a short span of time simply because this place is awesome!Its a little small in size but cosy and comfy, perfect as a hangout location. It does get busy so be prepared to wait during peak hours but they even provided a nice sofa at the entrance for those who are waiting for a seat. The location within Katong V makes it very convenient from a car park standpoint as we have very little problems with parking.The food is very well executed. For us, the buttermilk pancakes is the absolute standout dish in this place. After having tried many many pancakes all over, it is such a wonderful experience to have fluffy pancakes, made fresh and not overly sweet or tasteless. Not too chewy, not too flat - just nice. The fruits on it are abundant, without being drowned in sauce. We have tried many of their other dishes and most have been good. The truffle ravioli, cheeseburger, the fried poached eggs, are all super. We found the truffle fries and chicken wings to be just average but by and large, everything else was great. In terms of pricing - pretty reasonable for the size of portions and the food quality you get.Coffee is a little tiny for the price but the taste is pretty good.This place tends to be a little busy during peak hour but service has been pretty consistent and they try their best to get things out efficiently. Do note that if you have a very large group of more than 8 people, you may need to be there early or wait a little as many of the tables are catered to 4 or 2 pax. Lovely place to go to and highly recommended
5
We were in east coast one morning and decided to go Group Therapy for brunch. Their Chicken and Mushroom bread bowl was great! It can be shared by 2! Had a glass of fresh orange juice and a cuppicino. Try their burger ! Not bad at all!
4
Group Therapy is a great choice for breakfast on the East Coast. Located on inside Katong Village Mall, it's usually very busy on weekends. Seems to be not only a favorite spot of locals (also very popular with families) but also frequented by hotel guests of Katong Village Hotel (located in the same building) as an alternative to the hotel breakfast. The menu has a good choice of sweet and savory options and quality of the food and drinks has been consistently good. It might take some time until your order arrives when it's busy.
5
I've enjoyed my three visits to Group Therapy at Katong V so far, having sampled the hearty and comfort food like steak and cheese pie ($12) and truffle ravioli ($18), bacon carbonara ($14) and salmon with hashbrowns, cooked in rosti style (about $14). Cheapest items on the menu are butter waffles at $9. While the prices do not deviate much from standard cafe prices, the food is tasty and servings are rather large. Also GST is already included in the menu prices and there's free flow water with lemon. The flat white ($5) is also pleasant, as is the atmosphere at this chill all-day breakfast spot which is great for brunch or even dinner with friends.
4
This is a local for me, coffee is ok, not the best in the area but they do open at 9 which is decent be warned though if you go at 9 they are often still running the noisy machines that stink of disinfectant in the mall stinks up the place.The "sunny sides" is my favourite two eggs on top of ham, avocado and toast... Amazing.Friendly people and the service is a little slow as you have to order at the counter and top tip they only take cash or nets no credit card, also no table service
