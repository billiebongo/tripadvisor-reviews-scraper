Food is not bad. Filipino food served at this place. The grilled pork was nice. The rest was average. Banana smoothie tasted great. Service is slow but you can see the waiters care and try to rush things.

Have eaten at Gerry's Grill in Philippines and noticed there was one near our hotel in Singapore. We enjoyed our food but was a little disappointed in the halo halo. Would definitely eat there again.

Next to orchard road you'll find this restaurant serving nice Philippine food. We have ordered quite a few different dishes and all tasted nice.

After a long days work and you want a comfort food, I would recommend this place. The service was fast and efficient, food was average and reasonably priced. Sisig and Squid Kilawen will be the best dish I will recommend that you try. Halo-Halo a famous dessert was below average, I feel that the toppings are too little. Nevertheless, I will still return here to satisfy my cravings for Filipino food.

If you are wanting to try filipino dishes at Singapore and avoid the huge crowd in Lucky Plaza in Orchard, try this restaurant. A lot of filipino dishes to choose from and Bulalo (Beef with Bone Marrow soup), Grilled pork, Adobo are a must try. Other dishes such as fish, grilled squid and desserts are also worth for your tastebuds to try

The service of one of their servers, Edward, was exceptional. I usually dont reviews but Edward deserves the recognition and the praise. He would welcome you with the warmest widest smile, ask if everything is okay, and has been very proactive in everything. Cherry on top was we left the place without my credit card, he ran to find us to make sure its returned. He is such a happy and pleasant server that you dont meet everyday specially here in Singapore. Makes the experience dining in the restaurant so much better because of him. Thank you Edward!

My family was in Singapore for a holiday during the Malaysian Independence Day weekend (August 31) and due to being busy with work, I can only review this lovely Filipino restaurant called Gerry's Grill today! XDAnyway, while in Singapore, my brother and his wife (who's from the Philippines) decided to take us for something different from the usual Chinese fare. And so we made our way to Gerry's Grill in Cuppage Road (their only Singaporean outlet, the rest are in the Philippines), just behind Centre Point and opposite Holiday Inn Orchard City Center.What can I say about the food except that it's superb, notably the Grilled Squid, Pork Ribs, and the house specialty - Sizzling Pork!A must-try, for anyone keen on trying Filipino cuisine! :

We had dinner at Gerry's based on recommendation from a Filipino friend.The restaurant's location was deep inside at the building which was the Starhub's centre before. It was near the Holiday Inn hotel.As we arrived, there was a small crowd waiting at the reception table outside so we also stood there to wait.After some minuted, a staff came to usher the crowd in front of us in.After more minutes, we got ushered in.While waiting, we scrutinised the menu to see what we would order.The menu was compact. It contained some of the all-time-favourite dishes such as kare kare, adobo, liempo, etc.However some sucb as silog were also missing.Still, we saw the grill upon entering and felt confident that the food would be good.After ordering the cook in front of the grill quickly prepared the food we ordered together with the order from the rest of the patrons.After cooked, he placed the food on the plates lining up for delivery.Now this lies the main issue.The service staffs were adequate in my opinion but the way they work were messy.Everyone does everything from ushering the guests in, taking out dishes, collecting dirty utensils, preparing the tables for thr next guests, wiping the plates dry and stacking them up.With ao much varieties of things to do, it was no surprise that they neglected the main cause of a restaurant: the food.Our cooked and plated dishes sat there next to the gril for a good at least 30mins.If we didn't ask the waiter to check our order they would have still sat there for longer period.By the time the dishes arrive at the table, theyvwete already cold.Imagine chewing cold grilled squid!The taste of the food was to be honest, good.Then it came to the bill settlement time. The old lady cashier was so slow in ger work that it took at least 10 mins to just settle a bill.These people definitely were running at a much older processor with slower clockspeed.Kabayan Restaurant at Far East plaza was a better option for Filipino food in my opinion

One thing is for sure, doesn't seem to make sense to be additional 30cents for aluminium foil for a take out BBQ stick. We accepted that the plastic case and a styrofoam box (why is a plastic box and styrofoam box the same price though) was at 30cents each but seriously? Aluminium foil? Please refer to the pictures attached. On a side note, food was not too bad. Pretty decent but missing the Filipino service or should I say an average restaurant service. Don't see a single smiling face, just gave in assuming is that everyone was just having a bad day.

If you are looking for a decent Filipino restaurant in Singapore, this is the place to be. They have wide variety of seafood and meat dishes. They serve alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage. They serve good Filipino desserts. We ordered bulalo, grilled squid, pinakbet, lechon kawali, sizzling pork sisig. We had mais con yelo and halo-halo for dessert. The food portion per serving is actually good for sharing. My friend had dined here before and she commented that Kare-Kare is not that good so we did not order that anymore. The restaurant has a limited space so if it’s full, the seats will not be comfortable anymore. Do not get a table near the grilling station as you can really see and smell the smoke. I have noticed that the restaurant is short-manned so it’s obvious that the servers were struggling but they are still wearing a smile and they managed to provide a friendly atmosphere. Good service still. The restaurant is affordable

Great comfort food for a couple of Filipino travelers tired from squeezing a tour in a short stopover stay.
5
As a Filipino, you will eventually look for home cooking and this is the place. Located near the buzzing crowd at the end Cuppage Road. Truly a place worth looking for and the taste of the food is just like being home again.

Same taste as I tried in Philippines!! Waiting time is acceptable, food are great, servers are friendly. A great place for family gathering.

I hosted a simple dinner with friends which includes a foreigner and I wanted to showcase different sides of traditional Filipino food - grilled, fried, sautÃ©ed, soup. I ordered the following, which I also highly recommend: crispy pata, grilled chicken, fried chicken, sinigang na bangus belly, crispy kangkong, bulanglang, inihaw na pusit, garlic rice, and crab fried rice.Perfect combination. We probably ate more than we should, but it was a fantastic dinner with friends. You won't go wrong with the chicken and squid (pusit). Not sure if they deliver or if food panda services. I took food out and picked up from this Cuppage outlet.Service is as good as the food quality.

I brought along my colleagues one Singaporean and two Filipinos (who have never been to Gerry's Grill). First, when we entered, we didn't even receive any warm Filipino smile or even words of welcome greetings.Just a hand to point us to the table, its early about 12 noon and there are probably three tables are occupied at that time. Probably my expectation is that someone will attend to us as we sit and offer some water, drinks, or a starter. Well, we sat there and given us two menus (there are four of us) then no one came till we wave our hand and one of the staff so us and asked one of his waiter colleagues to attend to us.The waiter didn't even have any expression, not sure if he is not happy with his job or not and just took our order and I have to ask if I order this will this be suited for the four of us. Again, probably my expectation is someone who will be proactive to tell that this serving is good for 2 or 4.When it comes to food, we ordered the famous Filipino Crispy Pata and to be honest; I think they are using a bad oil. I don't want to say it's old but it isn't exactly a good cooking oil as it has a smell to it you can tell if you use a fresh or better oil.The Bagoong Fried Rice is too oily that you will see oil from the serving plate. But I must say my friends liked it.The Kare Kare is really what we call it commercialized didn't even have enough peanut taste with a lot of thickening (must be flour or Kare Kare mix) to make the sauce thicker. (It's a Filipino delicacy and if done properly, it will be too far from what Gerry's Grill have served us).We ordered dessert and the Leche Plan is too small as compared to the picture portrayed in the menu ( i would say it's overpriced with that size). Or at least when we ordered as we say we will just share the one Leche Plan and one Buko Pandan, the waiter should have informed us that its small and its only good for one or two. Don't get me wrong, Leche Plan tastes good while the Buko Pandan is so-so with a lot of food coloring to it.Though my Singaporean colleague says that Gerry's Grill is the only decent design Filipino restaurant in a good location and good ambiance. This one I must agree as we have not seen one before better than Gerry's grill. (Please recommend if there are available). Anyway, this is just sharing of experience of one customer expectation that is not met. Hope Gerry's Grill will treat this as a constructive feedback as I feel they can do better and will be great food place for Filipino's who missed authentic Filipino food

Went there to celebrate a birthday. Called in earlier but the staff told me that they didn't accept reservations. Walked in and was told to wait as they were full, we waited for abt 20 mins to get a table. I found the food to be nice and brought back memories of my trip to the Philippines a year ago. As the place was crowded do expect to get less attention from the staff as they would be too busy serving food and clearing tables. Would definitely recommend this place if anyone has the urge to eat Filipino foo

Came here to eat crispy pata, leche flan, and lumpiang shanghai. All were tasteful. This is a good place for u to showcase good Filipino cuisine to your friends. However, with Filipino hospitality in here, not so. They lack the service Filipinos have and they tend to be very robotic
4
Friendly staff, delicious food, reasonable prices. Pinakbet & adobo puso rice were so delicious. I am not an expert on Filipino food, but they seemed very authentic. Grilled pork belly was just so so. Overall not cheap, but reasonable for a restaurant in downtown area. Will come back if time permits and try other dishes. Highly recommended
2
The food was nothing to talk about. The air-conditioning was not good either. The waiters did not seem to want to work. We ordered Chicken and Pork which was very, very SO SO. The Pork was full of fat and no meat. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
4
I'm not sure why everyone is complaining about the service. We were served instantly and the food came out some 10 minutes later.I had some grilled chicken, sisig and garlic rice. All was tasty, and I was full afterwards (decent sized portions).The chicken wasn't so tender, but the skin was tasty and the portion was big. I have never tried sisig before, so I can't tell you if it was good or not, but it tasted fine to me, and my Pinay girlfriend said it was fine too.The outdoor seating area is nice, and there are lots of powerful fans to cool you down in the permanently sweltering Singaporean climate.I would come here again

Love their Filipino Sisig. Quick service. We had no reservation (on an Easter holiday) but they were happy to squeeze us in.
4
Well the food no doubts it's all yummy, but the service? Very slow service, have to wait for 30mins over for our foods before it had served. It believed it could be better than that
3
We were looking for a quick dinner, after the long haul from Europe and gerry's is OK
Close to orchard, not spicy ... The service is not their strength
4
Good food but let down by poor service staff : un-attentive, un-interested & slow !!!
Fortunately, the food was good.

beside my hotel , so I went here, and tried a steak, which was average , and cooked with too much oil, so so
4
Great BBQ food! The squid is a must-try, and the chicken has a very delicious marinade. The spring rolls and palabok are okay too. Loved the iced tea!We were there to celebrate someone's Birthday. Thew crew surprised us with a Birthday song and a candle-lit dessert

I have decided to introduce Filipino cuisine to my non-Filipino friends;a Chinese and a Myanmar friend, with two more Filipino twin friends and my sister, total group of 6. (I am a first timer as well at this branch).We ordered Baked Scallops, Pork Spring rolls, Enseladang Mangga (Green Mango with bagoong), Sinigang na Bangus (Milk Fish in Tamarind Soup), Beef Kare-kare, Crispy Pata (Crispy Fried Pork Knuckles), Sizzling Pork Sisig, Choupsuey with rice.Taste was good, ordinary and not so special, a little bit disappointed with the Enseladang Manga (green mango with bagoong) due to blunt taste of the green mango (I was expecting a sour tangy taste) and bagoong.Feedback from my Chinese friend, it was ok.My Myanmar friend, she liked the Crispy Pata (Crispy Fried Pork Knuckles).I have tasted better Filipino foods on some hawker shops here in SG.As for the service, every time we need something we have to search for a waiter or just go in front of their cashier counter or nearby kitchen.Table given to us was quite small... no room for other orders, difficult to move.I miss Gerry's Grill SM City North Edsa, Philippine Branch, it's definitely way better

The food here is not so good but the service was slower than slow.It took an hour just for them to take our first order. Drinks ordered would be forgotten and we'd need to go to the bar to get them.Poor Service. The Sisig so dry.Pinakbet so sweet
4
We always come back here for great Filipino cuisine like: inihaw na liempo, crispy pata, sisig, bulalo, palabok and the adobo rice. Yes it’s always a feast for us every time we visit this place. Not to mention their desserts like halo-halo, mais con yelo, leche flan & buko pandan. It’s always a burping & satisfied meal for us. Located at 51 Cuppage road (old Starhub building

If you enjoy bringing back more than a full stomach home, go there. Prepare to send your clothes you wore to eat there to the laundry after you leave the place. You may have different favour of smoke on your clothes. Mine was chicken and fish. Nice

Exceptional food, delicious . We tried different Food at different times...all I can say it was "superb". So much so that we ate here lunch and dinner
4
The location was so close to our hotel. Food price was reasonable. Everyone can come & experience the Filipino cuisine. Loved the sisig dishes and the variety of fish & chicken dishes.

Came here a few time with friends. I actually fall in love with GG first time when i visited their branch in Baguio! Try out SG, and they too are good! The price are reasonable with great varieties of good food! Definitely my choice!!

The food is fantastic, but the service is very poor. Waiters are acting against the clients. Suitable for groups, big portions, nice to share. Good price per quality of products. The grilled squid and the fish sinegang are a MUST.

Best place in Singapore if you are looking for delicious filipino dishes. The ambiance is somewhat similar to gerrys grill in philippines, so you really feel like your at your home country if you are filipino. For other nationalities this is the perfect place to explore pinoy dishes

For the reason that we're curious about Pinoy food, we decided to come with my family of 5 and 3 friends last Saturday, 23rd of May. We ordered quite lot of food from squids, spring rolls, mixed vegies, pork bbq, the oxtail with peanut sauce, sizzling spicy pork (i can't hardly explain what's inside) pork in tamarind soup and the cured fish in vinegar with pork. The first batch of food arrived exactly 45 mins. after placing our orders. We keep following up our orders but we still waited for another 30 mins before the next 3 dishes were serve. The worst part is the we could almost finish the dishes before the rice came. The worst part is that nobody bothers to clear our tables and even refill our glasses with water. When we ask for the bill, we noticed that some of our order were just an additional order, meaning to say that they've forgotten to key our orders that's why food didn't arrived in the right timing. Even how good and appetizing the food were, if service is not attentive, it doesn't make sense. We could even enjoy the food more if it all arrives earlier or we could say the decent time it was expected to arrive

We stayed at a nearby hotel from this restaurant. Gerry's Grill gave excellent service, great tasting Philippine food (wide variety). We tried different entree at different times...all I can say it was "superb". So much so that we ate here lunch and dinner for 2 consecutive times. Highly recommended
4
Exceptional food, delicious and typical Filipino food, thumbs up to the one who prepare the food, we will definitely come back here, but i would be more nice if we can see a little SMILE on their face, there was one crew who is very attentive though.keep it up whoever you are

I ate here because I was curious about Filipino food especially lechon. Heard the recommendation from my bf's friend that this restaurant serve the best Filipino Food in Singapore. We ordered Lechon Kawali, inihaw na Liempo, beef kare kare. We all like Liempo! This is the best. Lechon Kawali also delish. Beef kare kare, hmm, not suit my taste. Overall, I'm happy eating here. Well, it's a little bit pricey but it's okay. At least Liempo not disappoint me :

My first visit in this resto since i have also bad experience with other outlet in Philippines. We went there for late lunch and from the time we sit and our bad experience happened in this filipino restaurant in Singapore....We ordered for a drinks 3 beers and a shake, it reach our table like it has sitting at the counter for a while since it came more than 10mins from the time it were ordered.Next encounter was the food, we ordered 4 dishes and came in 3 and it really taste bad, their bulalo soup is cold then their infamous sizzling sisig is not sizzling hot at all and the veggie is also cold. All were served more than 25 min. It seems that the 4th dish we ordered was forgotten to key in that's why it never came out together. I"ve known the food timing even the grill items but this one is beyond the standard handling of grill item based on current customer inside.This is my first visit in this restaurant and will be the last. We complain to the Lady staff not in uniform but too bad my friend already tried to finish the food as he was very hungry and she say can't do anything on the food. I don't recommend this restaurant if you are craving with filipino food as their food handling quality is bad and so as service
