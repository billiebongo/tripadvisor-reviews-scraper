I stayed at a Hotel with breakfast provided but choose to drop by some mornings to have breakfast here just to eat the pork steam buns. Cheap and really nice!

I was looking for a quick supper, not very hungry from a wholesome lunch. This restaurant, which is more like a stand, is located in B2 of The Centrepoint on Orchard road. They serve steamed buns and noodle, and I went for the latter. The noodle was a flat type, something like the dumpling wrappers, but a little thicker and cut into smaller pieces. They were served in broth with anchovy and dried vegetables, which were both tasty. The dish is fast and cheap, enough to quickly calm a small appetite
