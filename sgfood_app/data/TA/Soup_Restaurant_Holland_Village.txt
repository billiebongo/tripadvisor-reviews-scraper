5th time here, pretty decent Chinese food, averaging about $30 per pax from the ala carte menu. OCBC credit card holders enjoy further discounts here.

New location for this expanding chain. Fans love the wholesome, simple but delicious food - nutritious soups, smooth tofu, silky kangkong, and of course the scrumptious steamed chicken with its heavenly ginger sauce. The Samsung of Samsui cooking.

I will always order the chicken and bean curd. Simply marvelous!
My family always eat there at least once a month and order the same dishes.

Good range of food like steamed chicken with fresh lettuce wrap, steamed minced meat , traditional dishes like fried vegetables.
Ambience is good in a new mall. Prices are reasonable.

It was the second trip, also with friends. Their speciality is the Chicken wrap with lettuce which is tasteful with a difference. They have many choices of soup that caters to all, I presume. The spicy potato leaves was delicious.The waitresses are very meliticulous and attentive to our needs. The food was served hot and timely so we do not feel the rush and were able to eat at our comfort.The location was great if you need to run errands after you

Nice ambience and convenient assess from Holland village mrt station. The food quality is quite average and the non spicy potato leaves tasted bad. Chicken meat wrap with lettuce is good , the soup is always great with many choices to select. The service is average and they are rushing the food to serve during lunch. Convenient place to run errand like bank and hospital.

This was the first time we visited this new development in the Raffles Medical Centre Building. The Restaurant is in a modern building and is furnished in a blond wood modern style.The menu was relatively short for a Chinese restaurant and had many traditional dishes, some with claims of herbal health efficacy. We chose the steamed ginger chicken ( house speciality), some scallops with broccoli and sweet and sour pork and plain rice. Unusually we had desserts of double cooked pears with white fungus and a herbal jelly with syrup. Both were extremely tasty if unusual.All the dishes were beautifully prepared and presented. Staff were helpful and friendly and happy to offer advice on the (to us) unusual dishes. The restaurant was not overly expensive for Singapore. A good night out

We chose this restaurant for a lunch cum AGM. Nice that they arranged their one private room for us. It was squeezy for 10 people. Food was good especially the steamed chicken with grated ginger, deep fried toufu and the steamed egg. Located next to the Holland V MRT station with a limited car park. Still a convenient venue to have a biz lunch or just when you are in the area.

Soup restaurant is noted not to have msg in its food. It's most famous dish is boiled chicken on a bed of green leafy vegetables. You wrap the chicken pieces with a leaf and add ginger to it. It is delicious and healthy!Other favorites are various soups , cooked with ginseng, black chicken or pork or fish. Minced meat with water chestnuts is excellent

Consistently good food and a great location. As noted by other diners, this restaurant is in the new building just next to the Holland Village MRT station and there's parking nearby. On this visit for Saturday lunch, the restaurant was packed to capacity by noon and a queue formed quickly outside. The set up is comfortable with lots of natural light and well spaced tables. A bonus for those bringing older members of the family - proper chairs are available and there were no pumpkin stools in sight (the traditional seating makes for a cute feature in their older branches but let's face it, they are uncomfortable). The food rolls out efficiently and we were not let down by these favourites:1. Samsui women's chicken - poached chicken (very smooth texture!) served with cucumber, lettuce and a lovely minced ginger sauce 2. Black chicken soup served in a baby coconut - the flavour of the chicken, wolf berries and young coconut blended perfectly. We didn't detect any msg which is great.3. Olive rice - delicious and lightly flavoured so you can enjoy it with other dishes.4. Claypot egg tofu and loofah melon - a very traditional Cantonese style dish. Good flavours and to be enjoyed with some rice.5. Stir fried potato leaves with a sweetish black sauce - another traditional dish. This one (regarded as poor man's food with the older generation) you don't find on many restaurant menus now.We found the prices very reasonable for Singapore. We were a table of 4 and our 5 dishes (including soupx2 and dessert x2) totalled S$105/US$73
