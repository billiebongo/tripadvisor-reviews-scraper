Good dish and well priced. Will return - part of a number of different eateries. Service was fast and clean.

I normally have this for dinner as I am a committed carnivore. Prices are quite affordable and the food is pretty good.

The white sands Pepper Lunch stall is quite small, but has all the menu options. We usually have the salmon hot plate and the double beef. The staff is always accommodating, taking care of my husband's food allergies with care.

This fast food restaurant has spicy foods because the overall reason are chickens and I really love chickens but I don't like the idea of adding pepper to the foods
