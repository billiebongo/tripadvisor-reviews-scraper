the ramen was alright. nothing to shout about. Ordered a side of tori karaage. left the largest piece for last and it was pink! Chicken that's not cooked thoroughly isn't safe for consumption

Ramen with very tasty broth especially the black garlic version. The kids meal also comes with salad with a very tasty dressing. My kid who usually doesn't eat vegetables would finish off every salad leaf in that dish.

Pretty nice Japanese restaurant at Star-Vista. Unlike the majority of food places in Singapore here you will find fast and kind service.

I am a frequent visitor to this place which says a lot. The ramen is very good. They have a variety of different broths as options and are also keen to experiment- the other week they had short shell crab ramen. Personally I am a traditionalist and the regular ramen is great- it just pips ippudo to the win although both are good.

The first time I came here was a couple of years back. I remember the ramen being very salty. We decided to give this place another try and came here for dinner. The restaurant's seating area was super cramped. Walking space in between the tables were so limited too. Ordering was quite easy and efficient since it was done through the tablet provided.I ordered the shabu shabu ramen with black broth. None of us ordered drinks as it was quite pricey.The soup was nice, but not as rich as the ramen at another shop we tried recently. The saltiness was tolerable. The egg was just right, soft on the inside. The meat was easy to chew and didn't have too much fats

Had dinner here with family. This was not the first time we visited this restaurant.We ordered the Cha Shu Ramen with black broth, the Vegetable Ramen with white broth, two Shabu Shabu Ramen with one white and one black broth. The broth was tasty, though not as fragrant as those from another nearby Ramen restaurant.They have choices of thin or thick ramen, and we ordered a mix of both. Honestly, there wasn't a huge difference between the two types of ramen, seems like the thick ramen were just slightly thicker than the thin ones. The noodles were OK.We felt that their facilities were a little cramp. We had a 4-seater table and the space was a little tight for 4 adults. The walking space next to our table was less than 2-feet across, and so the table across the walk-space felt really close to ours; a little uncomfortable.Overall, the food here was acceptable, though not fantastic

The place dining area was rather small, the queue outside the restaurant started before 7pm. Luckily we came before the queue started! We were given menus on the table and when we were ready to order, it took us a few seconds to realise that there was an ipad on the wall for us to order! LolAnyway, I must say they serve really tasty ramen! A little too salty for my tastebuds but we still managed to finish the Cha Shu ramen and tom yum ramen

The first time I dined with this restaurant was at their Westgate branch. This time around I ate at their star vista branch. The place is cramped that if your group is more than 5 people you would have to sit at separate tables. Food was good though.The place is warm .I don't know if their aircon was working

It seems unlikely for a tourist to visit Singapore and purposefully visit this ramen restaurant. But I thought that I should still contribute this review becausw it was a value for money lunch deal. For Sg$14 (tax incl), I enjoyed the signature red ramen, a drink, and karaage (4 pieces of deep fried chicken). Oishikata

We had our dinner at the newest branch of the Menya Mushashi at the Waterway Point located at 83 Punggol Central. We placed our orders using the iPad located at the table and it was quite easy to use. The orders came quite fast but the taste was average. A little disappointing. We wondered whether it was due to the food being pre-prepared with the broth being added when an order is placed. The place is a bit crowded
