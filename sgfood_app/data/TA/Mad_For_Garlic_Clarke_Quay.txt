You can never find more dishes with garlic than in Mad For Garlic. Highly recommended dishes: garlic baguette and garlicholic fried rice. Garlic baguette is super soft!

This place is a must visit, even for vegetarians. We ordered garlic pizza, garlic spaghetti and garlic icecream, and they were all unique and very very tasty. Definitely want to come back here again

Had to try this restaurant after a quick view of the menu.
Great choice of garlic meals, and it did not disappoint.
Worth the visit, but not one restaurant for every week to visit.

had dinner after washing ourselves with good beer, the food was good but again not much for a veggie. had to be contended with a couple of choices that were there.
4
5 of us ate here. We had onion rings & wedges to start, which were good. We then shared some pizzas & the Italian meatlovers in particular was very good. The prices are reasonable.
4
Was there for a small dinner.gathering of old school pals. The ambience was great, food and its layout was good. Possibly the only thing need improvement is the attentiveness of its service staffs. They took a while to noticed us waving to take our orders

I got a takeaway dessert pizza on my way back to our hotel... Chocolate and Banana or so I thought!!! I shouldn't have been surprised that there were roasted cloves of garlic all over it as it was made at a restaurant called "Mad for Garlic"! Not really my idea of a taste sensation but quirky all the same.

~went with colleagues for lunch, we'd been turned away before at 1130am, not that they needed reservations at this time as it wasn't full~Food was all good, some great, nothing bad, wait staff could have been more attentive, one of them did explain in detail what it was we'd be ordering~Cobb Salad ~Sauteed Mussel ~Steak & Garlicpeno ~Grilled Chicken & Mushroom ~Garlicpeno Pasta ~Lobster Cream Pasta ~Garlic Sizzling Rice ~Garlicholic Rice ~Chicken Doria ~Garlic Snowing Pizza It wasn't fine dining so the bill was the most shocking be prepared to pay

The only thing Mad for Garlic has going for it is a clever theme. All the rest ranges from mediocre to bad.For starters, the Garlic baguette was barely comestible. Someone has taken the Wonderbread recipe and figured out how to give it a baguette shape and crust. But you could easily take the six-inch bread and make a spitwad to throw at the owner of this travesty. Take the 'Garlicpeño Pasta'. It's nothing more than spaghetti aglio e olio, with a dab of canned jalapeño paste. The pasta is over cooked, the flavors are barely tolerable. Or the Grilled Chicken, Mushroom and Spinach risotto. More accurately its a chicken and rice as you would buy in a Salvadoran takeout. The rice was overlooked, the chicken chewy, and the spinach tasteless. The only good item was a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo. Eat at Mad About Garlic a few times and you will be certain that no self-respecting vampire will want to drink your blood.

This restaurant in Clarke Quay is a good spot to get some tasty Italian fare. The service is good, the ambiance is nice and the prices are not too bad. It is an alternative worth considering among the plethora of choices in this terrific area. The one thing I would note is that the menu is really more oriented to dinner as there are not too many choices, at least in my view, that are lunch-sized and lunch-priced.I was on my way to visit a museum nearby and wanted to grab some lunch before going. Clarke Quay was between the hotel and my destination so it seemed like the most likely spot to get a bite. I looked around as I wanted something that was not too heavy. I also wanted to try a place where I had not eaten before. As I strolled around, I spotted this place and Italian fare seemed like a reasonable option. I had been to a couple of the restaurants in this chain in Seoul so I knew this would be up to the quality standards I would expect.The exterior appearance was nice enough but nothing special. The interior was largely taken up by a bar that was the first thing I encountered when walking in. The dining area was further back a bit. It provided a nice décor and an enjoyable atmosphere in which to have a meal.I was seated right away as it was late in the lunch hour and only one other party was in the restaurant at the time. My server, Posi, attended to me without delay and was very good with her service during my brief stay. One small issue that I experienced was the fact that it was not as easy to eat light at this place as I would have hoped. Most of the dishes were pizza, pasta and full entrees. I was not in the mood for something quite so heavy. However, there were a few salad options and I ended up choosing the Mad for Garlic Cobb Salad. It included shredded chicken, tomatoes and cheese on top of greens and was dressed with a vinaigrette dressing. When it first came out, I was a little concerned that it might not be quite enough for a meal. But as it turned out, it was just about right to keep me going until dinner (though I was definitely hungry by dinner time and ended up eating early for my later meal). The salad actually turned out to be pretty tasty.The prices were not awful but I did think it was a bit expensive for what I got. I had a Pellegrino to drink and with tax, tip and service charge, it was $36 SGD, or about $26 USD. So it was a bit of struggle to eat light and keep the cost under control. But that would likely be the case in any of the restaurants at Clarke Quay so I suspect the location was part of the benefit for which I was paying.Overall, this is a good spot for Italian fare. The setting at Clarke Quay is great as it provides a terrific atmosphere. The restaurant itself is quite nice and the Italian fare they serve is very good judging by my cumulative visits to this chain. It is probably better for dinner as it is not really set up to cater to lunch unless you want a substantial meal. The service is good and the prices are decent though, again, probably more geared to dinner. Nonetheless, if you are in Clarke Quay and fancy Italian fare, this is a good choice

The pizza and pasta was very good.We came on Friday night so the place was crowded and noisy. Will come back again for the food.
5
a little bit sweet for my taste , but enjoyed the night in the Clarke Quay area. I will always be in love with Italian food and it is interesting to see how they cook it in Singapore:) Nice experience
4
Not a lot of Pizza variety, but the pizza my wife and I shared was good. Nice surroundings and the air conditioning inside was a welcome relief from the outside heat. Staff friendly and efficient.
4
If you love garlic you definitely going to get mad of it !!
good food for the price..like going there on a sunday night
4
Its a nice place for dinner. I really liked that portions were big. Mostly italian food. Staff was quick and professional (but they mixed up the order a bit). Only 5 minute away from Novotel Clarke Quay.

3rd time being here and never once the food is not satisfying. Was there for Christmas' Eve celebration with friends and glad that we chose this place again. Service and responses from the staff were quick and friendly. No reservations allowed due to eve of public holiday but surprisingly restaurant was not full throughout our time over there. Will definitely visit again cause missed out the beef with lots of garlic dish as most of my friends dont eat beef
4
I had the Taco pizza with American lemonade. The pizza was an interesting invention, quite liked it, it would be nice if small portions for Solo eaters could be ordered as one pizza for one person is a bit much and I hate throwing away food. The drinks were very good for a restaurant and the service was as expected.
3
I have eaten here twice, the quality of the food isn't to bad. However the portions are on the small side. The first time I made the mistake of not ordering a starter and was still hungry after my main course. On the whole not bad, however there are so many better places to eat in Clarke Quay.
4
Clark Quey is a place to be in the evening, but the deals daytime are great so is the service. I ordered a well cooked risotto and had a beer which didn't cost as much as normally. Service were great. I can definitely recommend this restaurant
5
This is the second time I visited this restaurant in 2 trips. Food here is just fantastic. There is a zing of garlic and chilli in most of their dishes and they definately do justice to their theme. Garlic Ice cream at the end is to die for!
4
Great place in Clarke Quay. The Pizzas were as good as the Pastas. Even the juices served were very good. Good service and what can beat the Clarke Quay Ambience?
4
Nice restaurant, good service and good food/drinks :) But you really really really have to love garlic, cause they really lay it on there! ;)
5
Garlic fans, this is your paradise, as i am a foody person so this is the best place where you can get tomato bocancinni and pasta with garlicious tinge of taste. Value for money

For context, I was staying at Grand Park City Hotel, just a 10 minute walk from Clarke Quay and this restaurant. I had the grilled chicken and mushroom risotto. It was very tasty and the atmosphere (inside for me) was just fine. I was there a bit early, so it was just starting to get busier as I was leaving. To me it's reasonably priced when you compare to other options in that area. I had good service, though it seemed like the food talk longer to come out than I would have expected. That's not an entirely bad thing at all though - would rather have it come out tasting good than rushed

My fianceÃ© and I were gifted vouchers, and therefore gave this place a try. We had a light dinner -- a Garlic Snowing Pizza and the carbonara. The pizza was crisp and robust in flavour. The carbonara was al dente, the flavours distinct and wholesome. The manager, Alex, offered us freshly grated parmesan. I told him I wanted "loads", of which he very graciously replied: "Loads, okay, tell me when to stop."The rest of the service staff were just as attentive and pleasant, without being overbearing. Although it was full-house by 7.30PM on a Thursday evening, the staff were composed and professional, attending to every table promptly with a smile
3
As a group that love garlic we had high expectations. The food was full of garlic and didn't disappoint on that front but the pizza was very soggy with oil and the topping was minimal. The carbonara was the best dish with the perfect balance of flavours and would recommend this. Unfortunately we had a waiter and a waitress who's interest seemed to be else where and didn't show any hospitality. Maybe we were unlucky but would not go back. And over all felt it was slightly over priced.

I along with four more friends went out for dinner and dance. We decided mad for garlic just by chance. Since it was our fist visit the staff served us complimentary garlic bread. The food is made with great care and good quality is relished in each bite. I had the best cocktails - we chose what the staff recommended. Service is good and portion size quite big. A nice dining out experience
5
My wife and I both love garlic so when we saw this place, we had to try it. We weren't disappointed! I can't remember the name of the dish but I had a steak stuffed with garlic and cheese and it was one of the tastiest things I've ever enjoyed
4
This is a nice Italian restaurant in Clarke Quay. They have inside and outside seating for people watching at Clarke Quay. Their cocktail prices are pretty reasonable for Singapore between $15-$20 I ordered the Garlic Maria which is like a bloody Mary but with lots of Garlic in it and a skewer of garlic instead of olives. For food I got the garlicpeno pasta which has toasted garlic on top plus lots of garlic inside. It tasted amazing but I still tasted garlic the next day lol.. Overall great atmosphere they had a tv for sports and everyone was very friendly. Food came quickly. I would go back but order something with less garlic
4
Dont come to this restaurant if you dont like garlic as every dish is laden with garlic the food was delishes.the four of us shared all the dishes we ordered which gives you a taste of everything.we especially liked the tomato bocancinni and pistu salad and the chicken and spinach pasta.there is not a huge choice of dishes but enough to satisfy all different taste.i like this restaurant a lot
5
Great food, very friendly well priced home style cooking. Did not have a reservation but made room for the four of us.

Ok restaurant with Italian food. If you like garlic this is the place. Ok prices and ok food. Service very friendly.

We came in here on our way back to our hotel at about 10:30pm after a full day out sight seeing. Had to order quickly because the kitchen was closing at 11pm, but that was an easy decision with a great looking steak on the menu. Food came out quite quickly and was really tasty, though very garlicy. I love that sort of thing, and my partner doesnt mind, but something to keep in mind. We were eating mints by the truck full the next afternoon to mask the garlic breath! One of my favourite meals in Singapore, very enjoyable

I'm still not quite sure what possessed our family to try this restaurant. But, I'm very glad we did! We stayed at a hotel adjacent to Clarke Quay and wandered down this lane one night. We were tired after a long day of sightseeing and the menu seemed okay. Everything we got was delicious! In the short week we were in Singapore, we even returned - which is really saying something considering all the restaurant choices there are in this area. I would recommend the caprese salad (fantastic pesto sauce), the pizzas, the terikyaki chicken, and the hug steak. Have a glass of wine or a bottle of beer, sit back with a good meal, and enjoy the people watching
4
My friends and I decided to tried out this restaurant for the first time and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise! All 4 of us ordered different dishes and they all tasted great. :) I personally preferred what i ordered - Grilled chicken and mushroom risotto . The risotto was really tasty and there was a decent amount of mushrooms too. Definitely recommended for those who love to eat mushrooms. Their grilled chicken was really tender too. Will definitely come back to try their other dishes in future! :
4
Pricey but every dish is a new experience. Nice interior as well. Ordered the Dracula Killer for Appetizer, seafood pasta, gorgonzola risotto with steak, garlic steak, lobster pasta.My favorite is their meat lovers pizza and wineade as drink.Worth the experience since it was a Business treat

The location of this place is one of the easiest to find as it is conveniently located right behind the Taxi stand alongside River Valley road. The bistro is a garlic-specialized Italian cuisine served with an atmosphere of medieval European rustic tavern. You just can't missed it.I ordered the Basil Teriyaki Sauce Chicken & Special Pasta Combo is a dish i would definitely recommend to everyone. The chicken is tender & the Teriyaki sauce is one of the best I myself have tasted. The pasta is also done just right with the right amount of oil added which makes this dish taste just right. It's hard to find fault with it.I've also ordered the Dancing Salsa Rice with Beef but regrettably the waiter did a very messy "stirred fried" action in an attempt to mix the chilly spice into the mix. Although the dish itself taste great the appeal in the looks department greatly diminished after he went through with it. It was so loud while the waiter was doing the "mix" it turned all heads in my direction! So my advice is please do it yourself.I highly recommend this bistro to everyone for it's great tasting food & rustic atmosphere. Just bring a friend or two along or your other half to enjoy good food & unwind in along side Clarke Quay

Even for garlic lovers, this place might just be a li'l over the top. There's garlic (and lots of it!) on just about everything - steak, pasta, pizza, burgers etc.We came out of the restaurant, smelling of garlic and swearing off it for a while
4
Have been here for quite a few times in 2012.I think after having to try so many different garlic good, I think feel that the snowy pizza was the best.And what I love most is the Heineken.. hahaha.. coz it is always 1 for 1.. and 2 glasses is always just nice for me and they always could hold the drink for me.The price wise is fine, most of the time, there are alot of promotions in-house or by credit card, once there was a promo for birthday month too by M1 and that's where I tried my first snowy pizza but that was in suntec...FYI, they have an exortic dessert - Garlic with Ice-cream or Ice-cream garlic, ate that very long ago, but din really like it cause I do not feel that garlic is for dessert

This is very handily placed at the entrance to Clarke Quay. The food here was piping hot, possibly some of the hottest food I have ever been served. The staff were very friendly although the menu was slightly limited and if any of your party don't like garlic then they have lucked out. Fortunately my wife and I both like garlic so we had a lovely meal the starter was a twist on garlic bread, with the bread dry and a serving of baked garlic sitting some of the hottest olive oil. The oil was actually bubbling long after it had been set down. My wife had a risotto which she loved and I had seafood pasta dish that was both chilli and temperature very hot
