We stopped off here on a cycling tour and were given a mix of sweet and savoury foods to try. Everything was delicious.

Nice cafe right around the corner from our hotel. Perfect for breakfast or lunch. Chicken rice was really good as was the coffee. Nice atmosphere.
5
This is a fantastic local place you shouldn't miss. Tea, bread, and breakfast was excellent ! Ensure not to miss this if you want an authentic experience and taste of Singapore.
5
If you're a tourist, this is pretty much an All-In-One restaurant for you to visit. Freshly baked bread with a local bread spread call KAYA to start your day. You can come here for lunch or dinner to get your chicken rice fix. If you're adventurous, order rice and local Chinese dishes to satisfy your Singapore food crave.

Our taxi driver pointed this place out on the way to our hotel from the airport. He said we had to try their Hainan Chicken Rice and claimed it was the best in Singapore.We visited the next night and found the HCR was gone. Staff told us we needed to get there early for the HCR so we consoled ourselves with their Crispy Squid and Hainan Pork. Both were delicious and very reasonably priced. A couple of nights later we hit the jackpot. To be honest I can't say their HCR is the best in Singapore. I can say I haven't had a better HCR in Singapore (or anywhere else for that matter). The rice had the right amount of flavour and good texture. The chicken was still juicy. The soup was great. The cucumber had just the right amount of crunch. Overall it was 10 out 10 as far as I was concerned.On the basis of two visits I'm happy to recommend this place to anyone. The HCR is great and other menu items also pretty good

A light breakfast for 2 Singapore dollars!! Kaya toast was amazing! A great little snack. Cafe is always busy so we thought we would try, glad that we did! But we mistakingly went next door for a latte and cup of tea.. we paid 13 singapore dollars for nothing special. I will get the Kaya Toast and juice tomorrow I think

My colleague and I had lunch and although there was a long queue of close to 10 people ahead of us, things do move fast here.We ordered the Hainanese Pork chop and the Braised Pork in claypot. Both dishes were served pretty quickly and were very well done. The pork chop was thinly sliced and fried to a nice crisp. The batter was well balanced with the thin slice of pork that it coated so you get an even balance of flavors in each mouthful. The fried pork was served on a bed of ketchup sauce and I'm sure they do this only right before serving the food since the pork chop wasn't drenched with the sauce. The end result is a beautifully hot, freshly fried, crispy battered slice of pork that still has it's crunch in every bite and well coated on the side with sauce. The stewed pork in a claypot was a dish that I would normally avoid due to the sheer amount of fat that comes in each serving. The pork is stewed long enough for it to turn into a chunk of melt in your mouth beautiful gooeyness that's artery chocking but so good at the same time that you just can't help eat more of the bad stuff. There. The sauce is not overly salty and has a lot of fat in it. It goes really really well with rice and will take a lot of effort not to over indulge on this good stuff once you get started.Overall, the food that we tried were excellent and I couldn't be happier. The ambiance, well, just like any other place in this overcrowded and densely populated little island, the place at lunch time is crowded and stuffy. Still, that hasn't stopped us from planning our second visit already

I shall keep this simple. Head down and order a cup of kopi, one kaya butter bun and a plate of bee hoon. After downing these 3 items, you will know why it's worth this rating. There is a queue always on the morning but don't be discouraged by that. 10 pax should be cleared within 15mins unless someone is making a bulk order in front. You can order your beverage and bun at the same queue for the bee hoon. Do not queue twice!!Hurry down

Was here for afternoon tea. The kopi and teh were so so but the toast bun was surprisingly great! They made the buns fresh from oven every now and then. We could already smell the nice buns from the kitchen the moment we stepped into the shop
4
Friendly staff and great choice of local food, but what keeps the place full, is the outstanding value. Traditional chicken rice is $4 (steamed or roast) and a truly refreshing lime juice drink $1.50. So good, we ate here twice in the one day, breakfast and lunch. Highly recommended

Easy to find
Always good quality and the right price. If you like Hainanese chicken rice this is worth a try.
Good for families.
No aircon but nice fans.

We stopped by this place to get some of its famous kaya butter buns and weren't disappointed. Best place in Singapore to taste these if you ask me.

old singapore coffee shop with ceiling fans serving authentic hainanese coffee and cakes located near raffles hotel for sgd2 gr8yummy deal. long queue wait 5-10 mins.

Beautiful Kaya buns and coffe served cheap and fast with an authentic feeling resteraunt. Great for a cheap eat of a morning! Kaya buns or soft boiled eggs with dark soy are a bit. Cost was about $6 for 2 coffe's, 2 kaya buns and 2 soft boiled eggs

This place is not only well known for its homemade kueh (coated by brown sugar coconut which is only available on weekends), but also very famous for its incredible rude service from their staff whom unfortunately are non-locals!!!The business is extremely good, always seeing long queues by none other than construction workers, for its Hainanese tea or coffee which tastes nothing special and of no difference from the nearby Hainanese coffee shops.On one occasion which is today I frequent this cafe and ordered 3 cuppa hot milktea. Upon serving a non-local Chinese girl toppled over the cup and the hot tea was poured on my leg!! Yet she had the cheek to ask 'does the tea spill on you?' which obviously was!!!Though she apologised, I am surprised a cafe like YY Kafei which is on TripAdvisor to generate good reviews for potential customers do not seem to have anyone of higher authority or rather the boss to appear to take the matter into his hands.What's more for the cup of hot tea that scalded my leg, I had to literally begged for a replacement!! What an incredible bad service experienced in YY Kafei Dian!! Think twice before you frequent or rather sit two feet away when they serve your drinks!

Simple decently priced and old school Sungapore food.Noodles in the morning is consistently good but the queue can be daunting. Their freshly made bread goes well with the homemade Kaya, or ask to have a luncheon meat, otak or egg bun. Homemade tarts and donuts are best enjoyed fresh. "Zhi Char" food at lunch is well priced and a good option for the office crowd.It does get a little warm at times, but we get used to it in Singapore

This is a small place on Beach Road near the Raffles Hotel. My wife's cousin had brought us here a few years ago for an afternoon snack. This year, we were staying in the Bugis area and on one of our walks, we came across it and recognized that we had enjoyed it before, so we tried it for breakfast. There are two lines. The long line on the left is for noodles and other main dishes. The line on the tight is for coffee, toast and other items like that. We got a couple of orders of toast and coffee. The toast, with kaya spread on it, was served warm. It was delicious. On our next visit to Sing, we plan on trying the cooked food.Highly recommended

They might have been known to serve delicious chicken rice over the years and a coffeeshop to slurp up some nanyang coffee, but hidden in their tze cha menu are some delicious dishes you don't want to miss!! Eg - Salted egg bitter gourd!!Slices of bitter gourd sliced thinly and deep fried in a crispy batter. After which they will be covered in a to-die-for salted egg sauce. If you have never been a bitter gourd fan, you might just be one now. ;)Got to love their hor fun with the 'wok' taste which i am sure many of you agree is something not many places do well.For a place that actually does many dishes well, it's strange that their fried rice is actually the least desired dish. Then again, with so many other delicious dishes on the menu, you really don't have to resort to ordering a fried rice..hehe.i have eaten here for years since my school days, there have been hits & misses - even the same dish ordered twice in the same seating can come out a hit and a miss. But this corner coffeeshop retains its charm over time with many long time regulars. It is a good place for me to lepak and people watch.

Have been patronising this quaint coffee shop for quite some time. I like their traditional coffee/tea and toasted soft buns using charcoal I assumed. I also like some of their kuehs and buns which reminded me of my childhood. I have also tried the chicken rice and wanton noodles before which are just alright. Yet to try their zichar (cooked dishes) Price for a cup of traditional black coffee without milk nor sugar and peanut bun is SGD2.20. Price is reasonable for a non-air con eating place in central area. The whole ambience is old school type of kopi tiam which is a rare find
5
I like their Soft Bun!! They toast it and spread the kayak and butter, they really have the best soft bun in Singapore to me.Whenever I have family and friends visiting here, I always take them to this shop.Whenever I feel like to have softbun, I surely come here!Love it so much

Kaya buns were good. I had gone in with a skeptical mind but my heart has been won over by the light fluffy delights. This is what they mean by don't judge a book by its cover!

We followed the travel guides to go there to have our 1st Singapore breakfast.
A bit disappointed...the kayan toast and the Teh tarik (Singapore Milk Tea) were just average...like those we had in Hong Kong...just so-so.....

Singapore is food heaven right? It is painfully obvious that there are many places to choose from. But what do you do when it comes to breakfast? I was walking around with my husband in the early morning (8am) Singapore heat. I was hot and hungry. We walked past YY Kafei Dian on the way to Suntec. I noticed that this place was completely packed full of locals. I quickly gave my husband the "look" (ie. THIS PLACE!!!). I said to him, it is packed because it is really good, or because it is the only place that is open along this street.On our way back to the hotel, we jumped into the long line (which is not an issue here since it moves quickly). At the front of the line, the young lady spoke to us in Mandarin. Shame on me for only speaking cantonese! She was so embarrassed and did her best to help (such a nice girl!). Anyhow, we managed to get some iced coffee and some of the "bread" (that's what we referred to it as and the young lady understood)...kaya toast! I noticed the other line...the bee hoon line. Quick as a flash, I was there! The lady who was serving is a prime example of angry resting face...but I think it's part of the charm. I improvised with my order...I watched what those in front of me did...and I thought ok, I can do this. At the front of the line, I did a whole lot of pointing...and then said egg...and then pointed at the meat luncheon. Maybe that is why the lady has a cranky face. Everyone is just pointing all morning.The kaya toast must have been good. I don't know as the hungry husband scoffed that stuff down within seconds without offering to share!!! My bee hoon (with a pile of jalapenos from the jar on the table) was amazing. For $2.30 I considered going back for seconds. But alas, my belly was full. Eating this local breakfast in a packed no-frills cafe that provides no escape from the heat is a great way to start the day. You are eating like a local among the locals. No bells and whistles. Just goodness for your food soul. :

One of the best local cafe in Singapore. Breakfast is filled with people working nearby. Queue for the bee Hoon, add a fried egg, tofu or super unhealthy luncheon meat to get the local taste. The woman serving is permanently grumpy which makes it even more local. When the bee Hoon has run out try the toasted buns. Have it with butter + condensed milk, or peanut butter, it's yumm! Sit by the roadside, watch the streets together with the skivving cab drivers.

I get to know of YY Kopitiam's existence when my Hong Kong pal told me that this was under her list of Must Go places in Singapore. Decided to give it a try and see how it fare.Its retains of the old School Singapore Kopitiam Culture could be probably the reason why it was recommended in the page of singapore's tourist guide. Selling old styled local breakfast (half boiled eggs, big fluffy kaya toast with kopi or teh) and other local breakfast items. It does also serves zi char during lunch and dinner times.Not forgetting its ambience, it drew us back into the 80s, 90s where coffeeshop (kopitiam) were simple and humble unlike the modern fanciful decorations we had in most of the breakfast places right now. Well, I should say, we can hardly find such places nowadays.Food served was pretty run of mill and one could probably get them from any coffeeshop.Service was turned off especially when beverages were wrongly served and the worker was rude to took the cup away .Kopi O was lacking in fragrance, I could not smell the aroma of roasted coffee unlike other traditional coffee like Nanyang Coffee.The toast was fluffy on the inside and crispy toasted outside. Nothing to shout about as I could get the same type of bun from many other places in Singapore. Kaya was spread sparingly on the toast and the taste was somewhat unique. It had overpowering of coconut sugar.The plate fried vermicelli wss served warm. Surprisingly, the bee hoon was rather tasty and was fried just nice. It was neither too dry or too wet. However the side dishes was standard-fare.Nasi Lemak was factory made with packet of sambal chilli sauce in it. Unlike traditional nasi lemak, there was not fried egg in it. Just deep fried kuning fish and ikan bills served together with rice which was hard and very cold. The fish was over-fried & the rice was not fragrant.It's kind of wasted or rather a disappointing for us to travel all the way down on a sunday morning and experienced its slow and blur service. In fact,Perhaps if one is going for its environment, it's still acceptable. For food and service wise, there were definitely better players nearby.Total Cost: $9.20For Full Reviews, visit http://umakemehungry.blogspot.sg/2013/10/yy-kafei-dian.htm

I can come here every morning! When you see the number of taxis parked outside you know this has to be a good place. Taxi drivers know where the best places for good food and value! Try the toasted buns with peanut butter, local coffee and fried beehoon for breakfast. Start your day like a local. The place is very popular with locals from cab drivers to bankers to church goers to professors so it's a good stop to hear some local gossip

A nice restaurant where is about 3 minutes away from Raffle hotel.I visited at noon and in the restaurant it is already filled with lots of local people!!Chicken rice(SGD 3.5 dolloars) taste really nice, The chicken is soft and not dry at all with authentic Singapore flavor. However, the price is a little expensive to me considering the volume is not enough for a men in my aspect. This restaurant is also famous for its coffee and butter bread.You may visit here alone and order one to two dishes, or come with friends to enjoys a table of excellent cuisine!

Just had dinner nearby this coffee shop ended up there to end the night while catching up with an old friend. As usual we were tucked out at the corner at the far end outdoor. Coffee and bun wasn't the best. As the chat progressed I thought i opt for a soft drink as my friend too was thirsty. So being a local we seek the attention of a waitress within sight as i turned my back I found a lady cleaning up a table and asked for service. She did not respond thus we thought she might not have heard us. There we were asking for her service, she plainly ignored. As i turned back to my friend she suddenly appeared beside us. In a rather emotional tone she started yelling at us, claiming we were blind not to see her being busy. Me and my friend were totally taken aback by her attitude. We appreciate the fact she was occupied, the decent for her to do was to acknowledge us, elsewhere a more sensible being would probably promptly replied in a more positive way. Rather we had this imported worker with china yelling at her top of her lungs at us for making a plain request as customers should. This is the worst coffeeshop i have been on the island. With petty coins over a cup of luke warm coffee, we had wished we had gone elsewhere. If you want good coffee, there are better options within sight. If you enjoy drama being yelled at by some 3rd rate foreign workers where the management simply don't care while making sure that you pay what you have ordered. This is the place. Infact they couldn't care less if the chairs are missing from the table, we had to sort ourselves out to begin with. If i had to conclude the workers looked tired and worn off as if they had civilian roles in part of a sad war movie. The only difference to fiction was that they stood indifferently, watching the crazy staff yell out at the customers. I wish you better luck than myself at this joint

We had a rainy days in Singapore. Once we stop by to Kafei Dian to avoid rain, had a kaya toast and milk tea. The kaya toast is so fluffy, tastes so good in my mouth with generous kaya and salted butter. The milk tea tastes all right, just like other milk tea in Singapore. Located in Beach Road, it's just 5 minutes walk to Suntec City. Kafei Dian one traditional kopitiam where people chit chatting, relaxing, and give you a local atmosphere experience. A nice break after long walk around Singapore

A great place to have a simple but good meal. It's where the locals have their breakfast and dinner (guess Lunch too) and it's really nice. Every time I pass this place there are people enjoying their food. So I will try some more dishes from the menu soon
