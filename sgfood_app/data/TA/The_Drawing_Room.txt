Spent many nice mornings here for breakfast and always leave pleasantly fulfilled. The buffet has all the foods you could want - from Indian to Chinese and American - to start your day as well as some amazing fresh brewed coffee and teas.The setting is luxurious and very comfortable.Cindy and Sage both have always taken great care of us and I look forward to many more wonderful mornings here

I visited the lounge on a weekday evening for after-dinner drinks. As one would expect from the St. Regis brand, the setting is grand and elegant. We felt welcomed and at home with the friendly and pro-active service provided by the staff. The tea selection tastes good, and there was a wide variety of food and drinks on the menu. The sofa seats were plush and very comfortable. The hotel was surprisingly accessible and convenient. It is only about five minutes' walk away from the Forum Shopping Mall. The Drawing Room is a perfect spot to relax at after you are done shopping at Orchard this festive season

The lounge is very quiet, clean, relaxed and comfortable. Food taste very good, especially the chicken rice, I would have to say that is one of the best Asian food I ever had.Other than foods and the environment, we have received excellent treatment from all crews, especially Paisly. She is very friendly, professional and took good care of us. All personnel were very well trained, accommodating and helpful (all done with a smile). Everything was handled with efficiency and attention to every detail was given. We had a great time.Thank you so much for taking such wonderful care of me and my husband during our visit to the lounge last Wednesday. All service staff were very helpful and cordial. And for sure, we will defitnetly be back again.Thanks again for all your hard work and warm hospitality

I was kinda early for an appointment and decide to get a cup of nice coffee somewhere while I waited on. Seems like St Regis is the choice and I walked into the 'Drawing Room' without much expectation but left with a great experience. This is an absolutely good example of what great service standard is about. When I can simply grab a coffee anywhere else and be in terms with it, but made a good choice to walk into Drawing room. It is the 'Experience' you created for a ' passerby' which simply has now becomes a ' memory' and will definitely be returning to try out the rest of the dining outlets... and I must say.. I have much higher expectation of the rest of your outlets now! Kudos to your Service staff. It is a shame I did not catch their name. Please extend my appreciation for a great experience

I stopped by with a friend on the way back from the botanical garden. Great surprise as I tried the signature cocktail made with the St. Regis tea. Thanks to Jason for the great recommandation

Please look for Paul, he is friendly, courteous, all smiles, patient, efficient and professional. We had coffee after lunch at Yan Ting and Paul has been excellent.

It is a case of style vs substance. This is certainly a place you would like to be seen. The ambience is very frenchy and therefore classy. In a very expensive city like Singapore $54++ for a buffet spread is decent. But when you scrutinised the spread you realise that it is ordinary and on the cheap end. You get to order a main course of chicken, beef cheek or roasted salmon. Yet again I don't see any French influence in it. I saw two elderly men enjoying their meal with a glass of red wine. The price you pay for a glass costs twice what you pay for a bottle in Europe. My advice: if you like ambience and money is not your concern, this place is for you. If good food is what you are after go away

Busy restaurant at St Regis. Usual buffet spread including hot counter. No fresh juices. Bakery quality was okay

I visited The Drawing Room mid of July 2017. The staffs are very accomodating and friendly. The best service I had. Kudos and my appreciation to the staffs. The Sommelier Mr. Viknes did a wonderful job in recommending wines. Very knowledgable on what he is talking about. The wine is very good to the palate. Manish serve us with his professionalism and his smile. Very attentive and gave excellent service. I will definitely comeback again. Thank you.

Western food is very good and tasty. Local food like char kuay teow is equally mouth watering. Service is attentive and food is served to your preferred taste.
