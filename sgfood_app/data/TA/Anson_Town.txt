I was given a packet of heong peah. It was delicious. The biscuits are very similar to "ma ti su" (some chinese biscuits that can buy in SIngapore/Malaysia).

Made the first visit to Anson Town at Changi Rd this evening around 6pm, for the first time with much anticipation after viewing their facebook.There was no other customers besides us (perhaps is weekday?). Had ordered their signature turnip chee cheong fun ($3.50), a plain chee cheong fun with sweet sauce & chili ($2.50), a portion of pumpkin cake (oriental style) and a glass of ice soy milk. Taste is mediocre. The taste pumpkin cake is acceptable but do not expect a wow factor, downside is it is not heated up sufficiently. The turnip chee cheong fun is indeed unique in the sense that is very rare to find such flavor in Singapore. However, the biggest disappointment lies in the quality of the chee cheong fun, whereby the skin is kind of thick and taste similar to those instant chee cheong fun, unlike those readily made on the spot upon order and is piping hot kind whereby skin is very thin and smooth. I believe they do make the chee cheong fun skin themselves as able to see the big machine over the counter, but the ones we had was merely taken out from the fridge and heated up I reckoned. Overall, I would not recommend and probably not return too if would like to have a plate of freshly made chee cheong fun

We were taking a walk along Changi Road when we saw this shop. So we gave it a try as it is supposed to be famous. But we were a little disappointed as the signature dish "Choo Chang Fen" was a bit too gluey and not smooth as expected. The taste was okay but the texture didn't suit us.

Recommended by Ipoh friend, I think this is the only shop I can find the authentic and tasty Chee Cheung Fun in Singapore. Must try their dry Chee Cheung Fun S$3.50, Asam Laksa ( Penang style Spicy and sour noodles) S$5.50 and pumpkin cake, all are very deliciously. Definitely will recommend to friends

We ordered a dry mee, Ipoh hor fan, dry curry chee chong fan, bean curd with gross jelly and a lime juice with sour plum. Probably the best dish was the lime juice. The dry mee was very salty, bean curd was no soft. The Ipoh hor fan and the chee chong fan was very average, Was not at all that impressive like what the other reviewers have written. Definitely not value for mone

My mum is from Ipoh and the food is very good and close to what I have in Ipoh. My favorite is the curry pig skin with steam rice roll (Chee Cheong fun). Is so good! I usually add fried bean curd skin as well. It's cheap and good - $3.80, the Kaya puff ($1.20) is traditional Ipoh style, not very sweet, very good. They have other food, like noodles, rice etc. I went to the balestier branch and they only do take away

We patronise Anson Town for soya bean curd, chee cheong fun (long broad noodles), puffs and Malaysian-styled coffee. Popular with locals who stay in the vicinity. The prices are above average. Soya bean curd is fair. The puff and coffee are better. This is not a place that one would queue for. Far out from the usual tourist routes

Most of Ipoh delicacies in one shop. Nice simple decor with air conditioning. Love the Nasi Lemak chicken chop and Dry curry chicken Chee cheong fun! Also the pastries look and taste the same (to me at least) as ones I had in Ipoh. I also recommend the Anson Chee cheong fun and dry curry noodles.
