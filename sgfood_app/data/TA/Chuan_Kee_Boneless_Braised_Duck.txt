On New Year's Day 2017, craving for local food so went to Ghim moh market and decided on the one of the few stalls opened. 10 people in a queue. Had a large portion of braised Duck with all the extra innards n egg. Quality of duck was excellent n quite lean. I like the innards a lot. My only complaint was that there was too much sauce on the food, tended to drown out the food. Still, after 20 days abroad, a hearty start to the year

This stall always attract a queue of people even before it opens for business around 11am. On a recent visit to Ghim Moh food centre, I chanced upon them just starting business and there wasn‚Äôt a queue. So I promptly joined the queue. It was a little early for lunch, so I ordered duck noodles, instead of rice. I ordered the kway teow for my noodle choice. They used the thinner kway teow, that‚Äôs more suited for ‚ÄòIpoh Hor Fun‚Äô, compared to most stalls who use the slightly wider flat white rice noodles.The stall was generous with their noodle serving and its topped with sliced duck breast meat and laden with duck gravy. What‚Äôs interesting is their fried shallots with chilli that they sprinkle over the duck meat. It gave a nice flavour and taste to the meal. It costs me $3. All their portions start from $3. You can upsize your meal for an additional $1, or add more meat or ingredients such as braised beancurd, eggs, salted vegetables and more to your meal.Try it
