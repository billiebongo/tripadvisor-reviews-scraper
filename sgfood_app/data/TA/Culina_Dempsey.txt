Very attractive concept with a wide variety of food and wine and restaurant. Spaghetti with crab were good and certainly want to go back to try out some other things.

This is a go to standby but after having a superb family lunch i thought i had just to compliment.
Service is always good friendly professional.
The oysters were superb and my duck confit fantastic.
Love this place. Thanks

Great fine foods from around the world....Caviar, Cheese, Cold cuts....delish!
All this in combination with great wines again from all over the word.

A great quirky place which operates as a wine & delicatessen shop as well as a restaurant. Great selection of wines, very friendly and efficient service and tasty food

A great deli and restaurant in Dempsey hill. I would always recommend booking but we often get a seat if you get there early.
Limited menu but all of it is excellent.
Great wines and supper relaxed atmosphere.
Well worth a visit!

Visited last month, had an enjoyable evening the Quail Salad is a must try. Service is pretty good would recommend.

Pick your wine off the rack , choose the specific steak you want and enjoy the lively atmosphere. The filet I had was very good as were the various starters and the crepe suzette. I will be back.

We were at Culina for a NYE lunch, a special occasion, celebrating our first full year living in Singapore. The adults ordered a shared entree of Kristal caviar and a main event of Tomahawk steak from the butcher, cooked to order by grilling and then finishing in the oven. A “wow” factor dish ordered cooked to the optimum doneness of medium rare. At $179 for 2 people it is not an everyday steak. Not for the first time this is where Culina seems to struggle with translation from guest to kitchen. We never received the caviar. When I enquired as to it’s whereabouts we were told it had been forgotten and we could have it now with our main meals. We cancelled it. Next the kids meals came out as did all the sides unfortunately well in advance of our steak. The Wagyu Ragu was delicious and my daughter thought it was some of the best she had ever had. The fish and chips were also soundly endorsed by our son. When the steak arrived the kids were almost done with their meals, the side of mac and cheese had cooled down and the green salad had warmed up. The greatest disappointment was the steak which was rare to raw. Definitely not how this cut should be cooked but most importantly not what we ordered. Culina has an excellent female staff member on the floor and it was at this time she thankfully stepped in. The steak went back for another blast in the oven.There are problems with re-cooking a steak after it’s been rested, carved from the bone and sliced unfortunately it is never quite the same. When it came back it was nice but that’s more a credit to the grower than the kitchen. We finished with two delicious deserts of apple tart and crepes both yummy for a total bill of $506 and change. Culina is good restaurant that could be great but they need to crack that code and work on the communication between the floor and the pass. This isn’t the first time at Culina and it’s never been spot on but we will be back.Next time I would buy my steak, take it home and cook it myself as the level of timing and skill needed to cook a meal like this seems to be just beyond Culinas skill set
3
Wouldn’t come here again. The food was expensive and not that good. They had fresh food but it wasn’t like it was more worth it. The cooked food wasn’t very good. Didn’t finish the fish stew. The crepe Suzette was average. The dessert of the day wasn’t good. Service was good.
5
If you’re wanting cheese. This is the best place to go. You can make your own cheese board from a wide variety of cheese and choose to either eat it there or take it with you. They have cheeses from all over and a great selection of meats and wines to pair with it.
3
Very good selection of beef, wines and appetizers. My OP Ribs had no flavours or grill marks that represented that it was grilled. Service was fast and efficient. Shall visit again when it's less busy!
3
Good food, good quality but service on Sunday lunch time was slow.... very slow. However I would return as food very good.
4
Very nice place for having a good dinner in a bistrot ! I had a nice dinner with a colleague. Took a good red wine too from the cellar
5
Had a wonderful Easter Lunch and Bday celebration with family. Staff are friendly and efficient.
Food was yummy.

This restaurant while having open tables outdoor is just simply great for ignoring their customers sitting outside. Their full attention is given to those sitting inside the restaurant. The amazing this is they just simply ignore eye contact with these customers. You have to get up and go looking for them inside just to tell them to take your orders. If they can't handle their outdoor tables then why bother having tables outdoor. Buck up, Culina!
4
Great weekend vibes. Early lunch with a friend, had to seat outside as it was full. We ordered the daily specials of smoked salmon pasta ($30) and pan seared wagyu hanging tender ($35). Both were very good but $30++ pasta at a cafe was a tad expensive. Wines and coffee was good. Not a bad Sunday outing at all
3
Nice ambience in a black and white with high ceilings and lots of natural daylight.The food was however average at best.The wagyu burger at 30dollars was poor with an subpar bread bun. The meat whilst touted as wagyu did not come across as special and in fact would be below standard ground beef patties made from good cuts of meat.The vongole was pretty good.Mac and cheese was decent.The vegetarian lasagne was blandBased on their pricing, expectations would be higher.Service staff were friendly but not outstanding
5
I cannot rave enough about this place! It's culinary heaven. A one stop shop for gourmands looking for top grade, premium quality ingredients, products imported from only the best artisans, and dishes made with only the finest from land and sea. The restaurant is a gastronomer's dream. Place an order from the seafood/meat counter and the team will prepare it for you to eat on site. I am particularly fond of the Gillardeau oysters, mussels (when in season) and grilled octopus. Go. Just go
3
The place has two sections - a shop where you can buy meat, wine, sauces etc and the restaurant. You can choose the stuff in the shop and a surcharge is charged to serve in restaurant. Interesting concept. We ordered everything from the menu and pointed to the steak at the shop (they know to serve the steak with the main course at the same time). Overall the dinner was good - steak was cooked nice, pork rack was ok (fatty parts was nice but the pork was a bit tough - is not easy to cook pork just nice), wine was good, oysters were fresh and taste good. Portion is big. The reason who I have three stars instead of four is the restaurant is a rowdy, partly because of the shop and maybe because of design of restaurant. The service is slow and not very friendly. Given the price paid, a bit better ambience would fit. An ok place to go to for dinner

My colleagues and I met here for a farewell lunch for one colleague today. We flagged one caucasian waitress to take our orders twice but she kept telling us to wait while she took orders from other diners.Two of us ordered glasses of warm water but it took them half an hour to serve us when the flask was just behind our table...Food took some time to arrive as well but tasted good. Only the male causasian manager was attentive in serving us..
4
Been going there for years ...and it has always been a happy experience.
A menu with a good selection of interesting choices ...
Food quality is top notch ...flavours have never disappointed
Service friendly and professional ..
Will be back for sure ...

Great spot for a week end brunch . ingredients are fresh , service is good and and it is very affordable .
Try their Bouchot Mussels , it is a must !
5
Quick lunch with a gal-pal as I'm in Singapore for business. The retail side is just outstanding with mouth-watering culinary heritage items. Foie gras, pate, heirloom tomatoes, artichokes and so much more. The amazing array of wine had me reaching for my phone to take shots of great vintages of New and Old World wines. Lunch was caviar and smoked salmon beautifully accompanied by some pretty amazing wines... a really rich Espresso and we're already booking dinner tonight...Don't forget bring a canvas bag as you are likely to want to do a whole lot of shopping after your meal!

Just discovered this place thanks to some very good friends. I had stopped going to Dempsey area as i just could not find any good quality/price restaurant there. Culina has a great indoor space and a nice terrace too. We tried the oysters, charcuterie, sardines and trout. Everything was super delicious. Good quantity and superbe quality. Wine was especially very good for at retail price value. Just one area we could hope for some improvement: the service. We got all our plates taken away despite the fact we were still working on the Charcuterie platter... and our glasses of wine disappeared with our last drops inside 
5
The place has a very unique combination of a butchery, gourmet store, wine bar, bistro & restaurant. You pass the gourmet store & butchery and see all the items on display and you automatically get hungry … .. .We’ve been there for a business dinner with a large group, did precisely what I mentioned above and started the evening with 2 large oyster platters for us to share. Besides beer, we selected white & red wine from the gourmet store, and although they charge a small corkage fee, it was definitely worth doing.We then continued and shared a charcuterie tasting platter, crab cakes, and octopus as appetizer before the main course. As they’ve all beef & meat on display at the butchery, we walked over and selected wagyu beef ranging from striploin to cobe and kurobuta pork rack. We finished the evening with some more wine and a very good chees platter. Staff very friendly, very reasonable priced for the quality of food that you get and highly recommendable. We spend an excellent evening there and all our guests were very happ

I have dined there a number of times with family and friends. There is ample free car parking. The restaurant has a very good range of wine, fresh vegetables, fresh seasonal seafood and different types of aged beef. If you do not wish to stick to the menu, you can select the meat, and/or seafood and vegetables and the wine from the retail store within the restaurant. Only thing is that they charge you for $15 dollars for cooking each dish and $15 corkage for each bottle of wine. I ask why they need to charge corkage when it is purchased within the premises. I did not get a good answer. Nevertheless, the staff are pleasant, friendly and efficient and took care to explain the menu if asked. A good place to have a very good meal with reasonable prices

My wife and I visited this place for dinner on Dec 26, 2016 (Mon).Location and Parking---------------------------Centrally located in Singapore’s chic Dempsey Hill estate, the restaurant is right opposite Jones the Grocer.The nearest MRT station is Holland Village MRT where there are regular shuttle buses (every 30min offpeak, every 55min evening peak. Google for “Dempsey Hill shuttle”). It is not practical to walk.Parking is free within the Dempsey Hill estate. Lots are on gravel or rough tarmac. To ensure you get a lot, come before 6:30pm.Ambience & Layout--------------------------The layout is such that half of it is a butchery-cum-supermarket selling premium meats, and gourmet groceries and cooking materials (salt slab for cooking, honeycomb slabs, high-end wines). The butchery side is the wholesale supplier of Australian beef (and fresh oysters) to more than 1000 Singaporean restaurants, including CUT by Wolfgang Puck and all 6 celebrity restaurants at Marina Bay Sands. The other half is the restaurant itself - large, air-conditioned with bistro tables outside. The restaurant section alone can easily at least sit 60 pax. Huber’s Butchery (another great place with butchery and restaurant section) is another similar venue in Dempsey Hill area.The washroom was dry and clean. The washbasin is outside the toilet and had a nice Asian design.Overall, décor and ambience was nice and relatively quiet. Food & Drinks---------------------Dishes we had (see attached photo for menu and prices):1. Bread (free flow) with vinegar and olive oil – Sourdough bread. Warm and yummy.2. Pan-fried Mixed Mushrooms ($8) – 2 types of fungi. Savoury and tastes crunchy. Also available at the gourmet supermarket section.3. Grilled Brined Kurobuta Pork Rack ($35) – This was quite a big slab of meat. Well-marinated and thoroughly cooked but not tough at all. It came with quite a bit of veg and potatoes, so I didn’t ordered other side dishes. 4. Beef ($6.80 to $10/ 100g) – The meat was chosen by wife at the butchery section (they come in pre-packed vacuum bags). You tell how well you want it done, and you have choose from 3 sauces. The cooked steak was quite good, though there was quite a bit of chunky fats that couldn’t really be eaten.We didn’t order oysters although I’ve heard that they’re great here.We didn’t order wine. They offered still/sparkling water when I requested for water, but they accepted my request for just tap water. Service---------Reservations - I recommend making an online reservation as it gets quite packed at night. No credit card info required.Service – efficient and polite. The Caucasian lady waitress (boss?) seemed to understand Singaporeans’ quirks quite well (e.g. we originally had wanted to skip starters and go straight for mains, and our request to have just tap water). There is 10% service charge but no GST

We had lunch here this week, and unfortunately for us that afternoon, the restaurant was fully booked for a bank function. However, the kind waitress offered us seats in the ‘smoking area’ outside on the verandah, and we accepted. It’s not the first time we’ve eaten here, as quite often, the restaurant is full. Service was very polite and helpful. The waitress knew the menu. She brought the complimentary bread and olive oil platter soon after taking our orders, and our food came not long thereafter, in spite of the fact that the place was full.I ordered the BBQ chicken spatchcock salad which was served with avocado, sweet corn, tomatoes, in a herbed buttermilk dressing; and my wife had the Grilled fillet steak sandwich with caramelised onions, sautéed mushrooms and mixed leaves. Both dishes were well presented. The food was warm, portions right. The chicken was tender, maybe a little small, and personally, I would like slightly more of the herb flavours. The fillet was tender, not fibrous or fatty, and went well with the sweetness of the caramelised onions, golden raisins and mushrooms. If anything a little too sweet for me. We like the ambiance the old colonial building provided, especially the black wooden rafters and high ceiling fans.After lunch, we shopped inside for some christmas presents to give away. Prices are not cheap, but quality is assured. They have a very wide selection of good wines, and fresh groceries. Even at the retail outlet, the service was prompt, attentive, and efficient.Culina is one of the places on our bucket list to go to for a special meal or to purchase hard to find farm fresh grocery items. Certainly worth coming back. Good for lunch with family, friends or business meetings. Or just for chilling out

I love this place. Have been a regular years. Culina is a combined restaurant, deli, and retail store. I have found their wine selection very reliable (for my taste), the cheeses, meats and fruits excellent, and several menu items amongst my Favourite in SG. Service is generally quite good and I am critical of service levels, so thumbs up in this regard. Filipino staff are usually smiling, warm and responsive. My only advice is to skip the steaks. They sell beautiful cuts of beef, but whatever the kitchen does to these steaks makes them forgettable. Skip the steaks and you will be fine.Spanish octopus, oysters, pork and salads are generally excellent. The burger and pulled pork sandwiches are also pretty darned good. Jean-Philippe knows his wine and is a good guy to ask for recommendations. The crowd here is unpredictable. The unusual folks who used to gather at the competitor next door seem to have found their way to Culina. So, the place can have a very different vibe from one day to the next depending on who is visiting. But if you get a normal crowd, Culina is a warm and relaxed place to have wine, eat, talk with friends and shop.Truly one of my favourites in SG.

My family used to go Culina very often, but not able to go there anymore, thanks to some rude waitress who delibrately reject reservations.I tried to book a table for Fri dinner, the waitress who answered my call simply told me 'it's full...' however, when I passed by the restaurant yesterday (Friday) evening, plenty of seats were Empty! After our dinner at another restaurant, even more empty seats at Culina.. well, we tried to call for reservation on Saturday evening, a female staff abruptly said 'fully booked'... again.. Well, I fully understand that some service staff strive to turn away customers in order to enjoy easy life, however, I don't think they have any right to do so. Co.is paying them salary to work, they are not supposed to chase away business. Were I the owner of Culina, I would conduct a thorough investigation and fire those who are not doing justice to the co

Ok meal. Service slow.Nothing memorable. Seemed busy and very disorganized. I had to contact staff on four occasions. To get a seat. To make order. Wouldn't recommend
5
Nice wine choices, great cheese selection, friendly staff, good food. Great casual feel to the place.
4
The ask you very much to you all, I was last Friday for lunch with a friend and we had a great time.
3
We arrived in time for lunch. The service was a bit on the slow side in finding and clearing a table for 5, but very nice. Seemingly people were lingering a long time over their cell phones or the final sip of coffee. Enjoying themselves - quitely. That didn't help in getting a table. We finally got a table outside :-)Once the food was ordered it came quickly and at the same time which is rare in Singapore.We had the salad Nicoise, fish & chips and a Rigatoni w/wagyu beef. The food was execellent! Fair sized portion and prices to match
4
We go to Culina to stock up on larder specials but today we were there for brunch and i was lucky with a most amazing starter as their special; the spaghettini with uni and caviar. The buttery uni's richness pairs well with the just right saltiness of the high grade caviar. Both generously dolloped on this amazing starter. Down it with Taittinger champagne.. of course. The nicoise salad on the menu is to die for - generous oily tuna on a crisp heart of romaine lettuce and just righly done eggs. Friendly welcome service always so Sundays usually start out well from here on.

We went there for a late lunch one weekend. After driving around the Dempsey Hill precinct, we selected this restaurant as it appears to be one of the busiest. Very attractive venue, incorporating a small grocer which feature mainly imported items from Europe. Large outdoor seating area that was empty, but inside are was full.We were there for 2 hrs, and the place was very vibrant with many walk-in customers. There were a large selection of vacuum pack meat cuts and oysters. Very tempting but we settled for lighter selection.Overall, the food was great (especially the mussel in butter sauce and Hokkaido scallop). However, service staff were not attentive to non-existence. They were always rushing, to be fair, the service staff were very busy, but there were many other staff that were manning the grocer counters and they did not appear busy. On the plus side, we never felt rushed despite many walk in guests.Will we go back? Yes, but perhaps not too often, as prices are on the high side ($160 for 2A+1C, no alcohol). On the other hand, it is a very cosy place to spend a weekend afternoon.HINT: we can access two pokestops from where we sat, and they were consistently on ‘lure’ when we were there
4
Three of us came in around 12.15pm. There were only 3 tables only at that time. We were given the menu but the waitress walk away after that. After deciding what we wanted, we tried to look for service. Unfortunately, every staff were doing their own thing.It was a Monday and I think the French manager was 'off ' and nobody bothered about service.F&B industry is facing shortage of manpower but it does not mean a compromise in service for such a high end restaurant and there should be a mix nationality of foreign staff in the outlet
4
Other than the items available on the menu, you can also select various cuts of meat from the counter and specify how you want them cooked (chargeable at $15 per piece of meat in addition to the cost of the meat). We selected a piece of tenderloin and a piece of wagyu, and returned to our seats. Our dinner arrived 15 minutes later, and I must say that both orders were done very nicely.The bistro is simply furnished and brightly lit, and the tables are close to each other. While we enjoyed the meal, we do note that it's a little pricey and service is so-so.
5
Have had dinner here, what I like about this place is that apart from the menu, could choose our prime cut beef and have them cooked and presented at the table. We order their little neck, a pate and grill Brittany sardine which was great. I requests for grass feed beef and was recommended a tenderloin! Amazing good quality and pleasant dinner! Will be back for sure. And great place to order wines as well.
5
Had a business lunch at Culina @ Dempsey today and had a wonderful experience. The had the crab cakes as a starter, spaghetti with clams which was all really lovely an well done. My friends has the risotto which everyone enjoyed as well as the lamb chops that looked really good. Service was perfect with a wonderful ambiance. The specials looked very exciting with a fantastic array of wines to accompany any meal. Will be back again for sure!!!
4
We have visited Culina several times and love the food here. Service is always friendly and efficient. The oysters are incredible.
4
Wow. What i steak. All i can say. Had some kind of sirloin and a glass of red wine. Not the most inspiring resturant to be in, and a little boring atmosphere. But food is so good i cant complain.
4
Excellent food has been served both times I've visited Culina. The service can sometimes fall down slightly, but nothing too major. I've been served a glass of champagne before after asking for chablis. Probably serves me right. Otherwise it's always fresh and well cooked.
3
I particularly like Culina for its location in Dempsey Road. I had some oysters which were fat and juicey and the piece of steak I had was cooked to perfection. Unfortunately service was slow and grudging.
4
Went to Culinary as a last minute decision on a Saturday night. Although late the Resturant was more than happy to serve the 4 of us and the service was very good.The food was exceptional and the steak was one of the best I have had from all my travels in Asia.I would say this is a high end Resturant and although you will pay in line with the level of Resturant the food did not disappoint
4
Food has always been delicious, service is a bit inconsistent. On a busy Friday evening, most of the waitresses tried their level best not have any eye contact with customers, however, we managed to get Jeff's attention and we were impressed by his wonderful & cheerful personality. Hope the company values such human asset as long as long as possible
4
Family dinner. Choose our steaks at the Butcher bar and they were presented to us about 20 minutes later, absolutely exquisitely done. We had a selection of steak from the value end of the spectrum to the top of the midrange. All were excellent and shows one doesn't gave to have the most expensive to have an excellent steak. The truffle fries were good and the Brussels sprouts in garlic excellent, with a little bit of crunch and great flavour. Had a good, reasonably priced red wine that was served a little warm but the waitress sorted that out in shirt time with an ice bucket. A napkin to wipe down the wet bottle when.pouring the wine would have been nice. Clean, simple and bright dÃ©co, maybe not ideal for a romantic dinner but the food is worth it
2
Waited for over 30 minutes for a salad for a simple salad of rocket and a poached egg. The food was ok but it's over-priced for the quality. Service was polite but there were obvious communication and kitchen problems. The waitress came back to me twice to tell me that different ingredients in my order were unavailable. Pity, the space seems to have lots of potential.
4
Came here to take shelter from the rain. Discovered a brightly lit restaurant cum supermarket.The restaurant featured a simple range of salads, pastas and sandwiches. The highlight was the ability to choose from a range of meats available from the supermarket section. Pick a cut from a wide range of meats, pay a small cooking fee, pick some side dishes, sit back and relax. The food was delicious. Finish off with a choice from a small range of desserts and an excellent exoresso.Managed to buy fresh vegetables for a salad dinner too.No rush or pressure to leave. Unobtrusive but attentive service. Will be back

I was there yesterday (Saturday evening 9 pm). For dinner for 3 pax. Had service from Sherelyn. She was very rude to us, literally throwing our plates with food on the table. When we ask to call manager, she shouted at me that she already called her supervisor. I find this completely unacceptable and wanted to leave. But we came there with my old friend who I didn't see for years to have a quiet dinner, dedicated for my friend's belated birthday. That actions almost ruined our dinner experience. Also, the stuff did not clean our dishes after we done, and started serving our next dishes. The brought my main without providingM any cutleries s.My steak & mushrooms were undercooked. I asked for medium well. Have to return it for proper cooking. And even after returning my plate again, my meat was still to raw for me. After having this horrible service I lost my appetite, I found my good piece of meat tasteless and even sauces couldn't help the situation.The next day I called this restaurant again asking for a manager Jean Philipe, but he was around again. It seems that in their pick hours (Saturday& Sunday) this restaurant has no management. That's perfectly explains why their service sucks
5
Great meat selection to be had here since you can go and choose the choice from the fresh meat counter thats on offer as they also sell their produce should you wish to go take some home.
5
This place is one of a kind in terms of food quality. We ordered meat, oysters, wines and deserts, the quality is top notch. A lot of the reviewers are right about the service - they could use a bit more graciousness in their step.
4
Upmarket deli turned bistro serving great steaks and European food. We enjoyed wagyu burgers, Dover sole, and trout sandwich (which was really smoked salmon). Good service and the right ambience for a leisurely Saturday afternoon lunch
4
On a stormy day in Singapore my friends chose this delightful restaurant for brunch, The unique setting of a restaurant along with a market. A meat counter where you could select you meat, chicken or fish. A wonder wine selection added to the wonderful meal.
5
The restaurant offers authentic western cuisine. The ingredient for preparation of the food are quite unique and special in taste. Must try and won't regret.
5
Came in late for dinner to celebrate my daughters good results... actually only an excuse to eat and drink well. The place was packed (suggest you book in advance) but the service was still excellent. We had to wait but wait comfortably whilst they got a leaving customers table ready. We immediately went to the meat section to choose our steaks. Had the Blackmore Fullblood Wagyu Victoria and the Kobe Striploin Wagyu both cooked to the doneness desired and tasted excellent... it's good to heed the advise of the "butcher" behind the meat :-).. Wine selection whilst not extensive was still excellent. Ambience was nice and service professional - always with a smile..Desserts... try the Apple Tart..my personal favorite...(sorry no pictures as it finished as soon as it landed on the table !)We will be back and back again. This place has my 5 Thumbs rating. Excellent !
2
Six of us went to Culina for dinner on a Tuesday evening...service was terrible. It took us probably half an hour to even place a wine order, let alone to order food. I cannot understand why Culina is so understaffed. The restaurant had no atmosphere, it felt like a brightly lit canteen. The food was very tasty but we won't be back.
5
I had lunch at Culina and must say I was really impressed. You choose your meat and your cheese and everything else from the shop, then it gets cooked and served. You pay the normal shop prices plus a cooking surchargeIt is modern interior and vibey atmosphere....careful over the weekend it is absolutely packedFor me it was mainly the meat that was impressive. It was cooked to perfectionThe Oysters are fantastic and fresh, try 2 of each, they are so differentDon't forget to shop, the olive oils are great, especially Chateau Estoublon.....fantastic and in a sexy bottl

Came here for my wedding anniversary and was pleasantly surprised by the food, wine and atmosphere. Its a child-friendly place despite being an up-market restaurant. Quite a few reputable steakhouses in town has a no-child policy or impose a minimum age for children. They serve a good selection of steak of different cuts from well-known farms from USA, Australia and NZ. I like that you get to choose the cut you want deli-style before the chefs cook it for you.The steak done-ness was perfect and although they don't have a professional wine sommelier but given their background as purveyors of fine foods, we got a wine from the daily menu and it went well with our steak. We didn't try the oysters though but from observations of other guests, we can tell that they really enjoyed them since Culina serves an exclusively wide range of fresh oysters from various origins. We had the crab cake as an appetizer and its the best crab cake I've had so far as every bite is chockfull of fresh crab meat and truly taste of the sea. I like that whilst waiting for the food, you can browse around their adjoining supermarket of fine foods which serves as a good inspiration for a fine food meal at home! Culina Dempsey is a great place to chill out, unwind over a nice glass of wine and steak/oysters and feeling totally satisfied because you didn't have to pay a bomb like you would at some other steakhouse or dress up fancifully for the meal or think twice about bringing your kids
1
Two dishes didn't show up. 15 quid for a burger that was smaller than a hockey puck and tasted like one. Even the steak sandwich was underwhelming. Wagyu? What a joke. I guess people come here cause they feel like they are getting a European experience.
4
Good spread of different steaks, wines, oysters, cheese to go along. Nice setup. Friendly staff. A bit pricey.
4
They have some nice eats in the surrounding of leafy dempsey hill and great selection of burgundy wines albeit a bit pricey
4
Nice place for a casual and relax weekend lunch. There is a gourmet section as well for Grocery shopping. You get to select your meat and they are grilled to a prefect texture.
4
Whenever I'm in need of a nice glass of bubbly & tasty food, I usually end up here. The service is prompt, the staff aren't very friendly but they are professional.

Culina can be relied upon for the finest of food. Competition is high in Dempsey and poor food does not exist or survive for long. Had visitors from overseas and made a reservation for dinner at Culina. Reservations are necessary especially at weekends. There is outdoor and indoor dining area on nice comfortable seating. Although I would class as fine dining it is also relaxed and not too formal. Opted for beef Wagyu tartare to start which was excellent and of a good size. For main course we chose a steak from the retail counter - which chef then cooks to perfection. Remember to order your vegetables as the staff may not prompt you. The steak was excellent and it was a wonderful meal. Desert was nice and all washed down with a nice glass of armagnac!!Things to remember: in addition to the restaurant there is also a gormet retail shop. You may order from the menu or identify meat from the retail shop and have it nicely prepared for a $15 surcharge - wonderful selection there so be sure to check it out. There is more selection of wine in the retail shop than on the wine list. You may choose your wine in shop and that is without a surcharge. We chose Petluma Syrah which was excellent. Service was good - albeit not as attentive as when the owner is about. The ambiance is relaxed and a perfect place to dine. Staff can call taxis if required.
4
This restaurant is located on Dempsey Hill, and it offers a great selection of pick your own steaks cooked to order. Pair it with one of the wines from a wide selection, and you have a really nice, albeit pricey meal. The seating is limited so be sure to make a reservation. On a side note, Dempsey Hill is a really nice area offering a wide variety of dining, bars and retail stores. It's worth visiting.
4
This was our first time at this restaurant. They have seating, inside and out and also have a seating area for smokers.The portion size is very good and so is the food.Me and my other guests all ordered steaks. You have to go to the butcher counter to choose which steak you would like. I was surprised that they charge $15 on top of the price of steak to prepare it. (As in cook it).I would go back
4
I went to the Culina for dinner with a couple of friends. We sat outside where it was super comfortable and we very much enjoyed our privacy at the end of the terrace. Service was very attentive and friendly. Food was delicious - the truffle fries were simply amazing - loved them!! Meat has good quality and was cooked to the point. I really like the combination of grocery store and restaurant. The ambience was like you were at a friends' place - super relaxed! Price of the food was rather expensive but it was worth it

An unique combination of gourmet grocery store and bistro. The decor and atmosphere of the grocery is like the ones in NYC. They sell foods as well, and the most fun part is you can eat those in this premise. Choose meat or seafood and tell them how you like them to be cooked. Cozy & fun place specially good to go with friends
3
The food was good (although nothing mind blowing in terms of the menu) but the place is quite overpriced for what it is. The setting is nice and the market inside where you can choose your food is cute. Decent place for a Sunday lunch among friends
4
We stopped in for a casual brunch, sat at the bar. A nice menu and service was good. Recommend the cheese tasting plate, wine and espresso drinks. Also offers good Italian food shopping.
4
I went with my wife for dinner. The food was good. Not outstanding for the price but good. The quality of service was excellent. Fast and friendly.
4
We had a very nice dinner in a relaxed surrounding with our friends, food was excellent. You can go to the butcher counter and select your piece of meat and get it cooked as per your likings. Good wine selection and very friendly service.
4
Ideal place to have a smaller bite. Like a lunch or so. Either inside or al-fresco. While waiting for your food, just peep into the deli and you will be overwelmed by the great choice of cheeses. Or meats. They have a very decent choice of wines too.Food was ok. Nothing extremely special but for a lunch it is all I am asking for. For service it seems the place is a bit stretched, but the friendliness of the staff helps a lo
3
Refreshing place to go to. A few bottles of wines are quite good. Food, so-so. Actually, the food quality does not justify the price.Anyway, I come here for the ambience, the wine, the convenience to get there and park, and the refreshing place for a few friends to gather. Not here for the food
5
Decided to drop by here for dinner with a friends, happens to be a few weeks ago. We order some fresh sardine, rump cut (don't remember what is called), both came up excellent. What I like about Culina is that you have many (I mean lots) of prime cut beef. Both dishes turns up excellen
2
Came in as a solo dinner - spent 350 sgd in food and take away - service from the staff was poor and not attentive - no smile and no attention given - did not clear plates - asked at the cashier desk if can call a cab and they said oh don't worry u ll find a cab outside - had to wait 30 mins to find one - I don't think I'll come back - pitty as the food was good
4
The staff is very friendly and very well trained . The restaurant is adjacent to the gourmet store. You can go and choose your own meat at the butcher s counter . Abundant choice of cuts and high quality meat. The food is mostly simple European fares , with good pasta ( Vongole , Ragu ) and a good selection of wine by the glass as well. Nice selection of oysters is available . Restaurant is located in Dempsey Hill.Nice place to go with friends or family . Tends to be very full on Sunday's and Saturday lunches

7 of us visited for dinner on July 25th. Ordered a kilo and a half of steaks to be shared (each diner had his/her own other main dish); and it turned out to be the worst steak anyone of us have had. Medium rare became well done, not only that, the steak was simply tasteless. We are gourmets who dine all over the world and told ourselves we will never ever come back
4
My favourites are the dover sole and lemon sole, burgers and the oysters. It is the perfect place for our family as it meets everyones needs from the biggest meat eater, to Mac and cheese cravings, to caviar and oysters should that be your mood. You can choose from all their great wines. Some days they are inconsistent - I think the chefs days off. That is disappointing because you get used to awesome food and get the occasional really average meal. I think it might be Sunday or Monday?
5
Come, enjoy, be happy! Best meat place in town, good wine, also pasta excellent. Definitely worth the price! Friendly staff and also kids friendly. Call for reservation!
5
Took my 6 year old daughter for dinner Saturday. The place is always busy and I would say the ladies running the place do a good job but not always great of seat allocation. As a "local" the answer was we are full but we got a sell by seat ie out by 7 - no prob.We had superb oysters from France which my daughter loves and we shared a great burger. The green beens arrived pretty late after a chase up
3
If you are a beef fan, this is the place for you. My kids love it but not me because i am not a beef fan, a fussy seafood eater and not a cheese fan either. The only dish i always eat is the roasted chicken, which is alright, nothing spectacular.The seafood especially fish has a "taste" which people generally found it ok though not for me, who grew up eating live fresh seafood all my life. And the seafood are mostly sea rather ocean fishes
4
Visited the bistro for dinner recently, it has a friendly crew and the food was good. The oysters were fresh and the menu was fairly decent with a range of main courses but find the pasta selection limited. I find the wait of 45 minutes for the meat or fish dish prepared your way a bit too long. It a great place for a family meal
4
The place has limited seating so my friend and I only managed to get two seats at the bar. Food was rather superb - we had a salad with goats cheese which was fantastic. I had the beef cheek as the main and the portion was substantial and the taste was good. Quality of the food was excellent. Just wish it was less pricey. The ambience is that of a bustling cafe but the price is that of a fine dining joint
1
I came in to the shop to buy some groceries. I heard what sounded like someone cutting their nails but thought that this would not be possible. I went to the meat section and lo and behold the lady behind the meat counter was cutting her nails. What made this even more disgusting was that the door to the meat section was open. I asked her why she was doing this and she did not seem to think that this was an issue at all. I raised this to the manager on duty and he also did not seem to care. As the only thing I could do was leave without buying anything that is what I did. I am truly amazed that this establishment would condone such activities but their staff and this lack of hygiene means that I will never ever shop or eat here again (and I was a regular before this).
4
The staff here are the key. very industrious, courteous and not the centre of the show. leaving you to get on with a relaxing meal. the menu is varied enough, but you can choose any meat or fish from the store and the prep fee is reasonable.. same for wine corkage in the store.. its normally $15 & $8 respectively. having said that stick to the wine on the chalk board, which is well selected and its even cheaper. the flexibility is what gives the place a unique edge - table or bar; inside or out; dinner or nibble; fish, meat, and the list goes on. All in All a good well run and well balanced place. as good for sunday lunch or weds coffee or friday dinner - a corner stone of dempsey
5
Patronized the supermarket but never the bistro. Hence, I made a dinner reservation right after the visit that afternoon after my colleagues brought me there to buy some quality cuts. Well, the service was great; the food was deliciously cooked, except the fact that it was a bit noisy that night due to a few big dining groups. And, I must say that the Mussels (with thick fries) were to die for; the Braised Beef Cheek (with the silky mashed) were haven; the Belon Oysters were truly an experience! Loved the bottle of wine we had. The meal was not cheap (for 2) but worth it! Keep it up Culina...shall be back again
4
We had family lunch on Saturday December 6 for the first time, many table around us order mussels and we my wife and I gave it try with my wife a bit skeptical on the quality, when the mussels arrive and my wife tasted and she didn't stop eating. Strongly recommend the Mussels
5
The food is amazing, the ambience is very relaxed and chic. The wines are to die for. You can pick your own wine from the shop and drink the wine with your meal. The deli area is fantastic and my kids love this place. I would, however, add that its the sort of restaurant for a long lazy lunch with friends and some super wines. Hoping to visit over Xmas with my best frien

love the food shopping there too, so many very delicious and fun food items and wines. spoilt for choice

We've been in Singapore for more than two years now and are regulars at Culina. We love it. For a casual weekend lunch or dinner by ourselves or with friends, Culina never disappoints. Whenever we come here we inevitably have a plate of oysters washed down with a half bottle of champagne (bought from their wine store with $8 corkage added - $15 corkage for a 750ml bottle). The mussels in white wine are excellent and last night's fresh sardines were served with a red pepper tapenade and delicious. There's usually a good selection of fresh fish cooked to order, as well as plenty of hearty meat and charcuterie. The staff at Culina are lovely, friendly and efficient. And loyal too. Some of them have been there the whole time we've been coming to the restaurant. A bit of a rarity in such a high turnover industry. We have a small suggestion regarding the lighting: in the evening the lighting is a bit bright. Dropping it down a notch would create a slightly more intimate atmosphere.
4
Great bistro with great food! Relaxed and bright - perfect for a rejuvenating lunch. The crab cakes were delicious; Mac and Cheese was tasty and chewy. If you prefer a healthier option, the quinoa salad was a tasty choice.End the meal with the French crepes - a delight
5
We went there for our dinner during our visit in Singapore, we book a table, before 630pm and we arrive there exactly 630pm, they have a large selections of Beefs and Lamb, fresh seafood and cheese selection, we have the Oyster Platter to start it was really good and fresh, and we had the a steak each and a bottle of wine and was perfect. Service was good, but it is very pricey, hey look it is Singapore... If you want quality and a decent service you gotta pay for it. Overall a 5 star rating for me
4
Had lunch on Sunday and liked the setup and the way we were quickly seated despite the restaurant being full. On the down side, it can be quite a noisy place with not much privacy. The food was well above our expectation, the Squids as a starter were very tender with a real Italian twist. The colliflower soup was equally nice and made of very good quality ingredients. Bred was fresh and warm. Tried the goad cheese salad and the cheese was from a good source. I just added a bit of olive oil to make it to my taste. Overall 2 starters, 2 salads, 1 expresso and a large San Pe for 100S$, about right for the quality of food and ingredient
4
We've been there a couple times with friends. Service is ok, the waiters are friendly and slightly more efficient than the usual Singapore standards. The food is good, and you can choose your cuts from the butcher's counter inside, so it makes for a cool experience. In terms of price, I'd say the main dishes are ok if not slightly pricey, but the side dishes are way too expensive. It's definitely a good location for a "fancier" dinner with friends though
1
There is always rooms for improving especially service part. We finished having dinner, paid our bill and walked into your main dining where there are full of items we wanted to buy home ie soft drinks and perhaps few bottles of wine. We were told that Cashier was closed at 9. We did not know that your grocery area is closed at 9 as there was no sign informing us. We were turn away by a cashier lady informing us of we are closed for several times. I said this is funny, you turn away business without giving us any option. There was no option given. The only thing she said was cashier was closed repeatedly. Well we wont visit your place again

Culina at Dempsey Hill located in the old military barracks with their copper roofs and white washed walls, is with approximately 12 good rest and deli's. This provides a wealth of culinary delights, for me siting at the bar watching the staff attend to the needs of visitors , expiates and locals alike was great.With fresh breads and dipping sauce of oil and balsamic the clam chowder was good, should I have had the Qld Scallops in shell , three per serve maybe?Main was the special of the day a delight which was small whole chicken served a mixed wild mushroom and the tiniest small potatoes this was great. Wines were French or Australian, and well priced.A good coffee and a bit of relaxation.This made me want to bring others back
3
The place was nice, wine list adequate and the sandwiches were filling. Great service, extra fast from order to serving time. I was surprised at the short time it took the food to be served.Kudos too to the Filipino crew!Not to be outdone are the cheese & other food gift products
5
Came along with friends for a sunday lunch. Located in the lovely dempshey hill of old british barracks, the area is charming and surrounded by lush forest. The restaurant is part restaurant and part high end grocery store selling prenium food products, meat and wine. The restaurant is surrounded by large glass panels which gives a lovely view of the outside. When we arrived, it was packed but we were quickly shown to our table. Had the gilled octupus which was a bitpricey at $38, the grilled quail salad, lovely piece of steak followed by coffee. Our dishes were delicious and well cooked. Enjoyed the wine too. The staff was fast and attentive despite a full restaurant. Great lively ambience ! Will certainly come back agai
1
This place has great potential but comes down as very disappointing and way too expensive.
Unfortunately I would not recommend this place as the food is very blah
4
Clean, minimal, tables nicely spaced apart. Fresh and tasty crab cakes, nice juicy burger with good fries. Also a great deli and wine boutique. Better service than many other restaurants in Singapore.
3
I didn't get this... It's a food store.. With tables.. Food was ok, overpriced considering the setting. The lights were bright, no ambiance, but as I said its a food store so what can you expect! Not for me :(
4
Culina is one of the best kept little secret restaurants in Dempsey. They have a amazing range of some of the best cuts of steak around. Starters were really amazing.....best crab cakes in town, incredible fresh oysters and escargots. As for main course.... fully recommend their Kobe Cuisine Waygu. Its a huge cut at 350 grams and suggest you can share it together with truffle fries. Their razor clam pasta and their crab meat pasta was also a hit with our very discerning group of diners. Finished the meal with their profiteroles....also another huge hit. They have a excellent selection of cheeses as well as a exceptional wine selection. Prices were very reasonable for quality and service was attentive and polite. I am sure we will be back very soon indeed

Basically, Culina's is Singapore's leading purveyor of gourmet foods and wines, an interesting grocey store with dinery concept similar to Jones the Grocer and Dean & Deluca. Its spacious, contemporary and elegantly-simple designs exude comfortable vibes that feel very inviting to its patrons. Seats are available both indoors and outdoors. I really like the modernistic European design of this bistro.First, we started with a small bottle of dessert wine, Muscato (SGD$47.00). It was sweet and light like golden syrup, but not very smooth overall. Decent enough as a chillout wine and accompaniment to our oysters.Anyway, the bread basket came first - delicious, freshly-baked rolls. They were still warm and fluffy, and tasted especially lovely with their olive oil with vinegar.We ordered two each of the following oysters:-Perle Blanche (white pearl) - sweet deep sea oyster with a creamy texture.(SGD$7.50 each)Wild Big Oysters - raised on Atlantic coast, tasting of the ocean (SGD$6.50 each)Perle Noire (black pearl) - sweet and creamy, with hints of iodine and hazelnut (SGD$6.00 each)Royal Oyster - deep cupped, iodinised with a sweet finish (SGD$5.50 each)Gillardeau - voluptuous, almost crunchy flesh, subtle and refined (SGD$6.50 each)Overall, the service was alright and the cosy ambience are definitely delightful. The oysters are succulent and fresh, and even though I tried the vinaigrette on the oysters, finally doing the dishes. The total bill came up to SGD$114.00For more detailed information and photos, do drop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/05/chillout-at-culina-bistro-at-dempsey.htm

Hugely disappointed with this place. The food was fine although certainly nothing to write home about. I get that the idea of eating in the middle of a grocery store is somewhat funky but if you're going to be a restaurant then include the price of cooking in your menu prices. To be told that in order to have the fish of the day you had to buy the whole fish and then pay an extra $25 to have it cooked is just plain rude. Singapore service standards are generally terrible (surprisingly you get used to it), but the service here had to be seen to be believed. We arrived 10 mins early and we're asked to wait while our allotted table was cleared of dirty plates despite there being three or four other preset tables available. When we did get a seat, our wine order disappeared into thin air air along with our waitress so we reordered only to have the wine taken from the cabinet next to our table! We had to ask two or three times to to get water and once our meal was finished only half the table was cleared. In fact after 10 minutes of waiting we ended up clearing the plates away ourselves, despite asking a waiter directly to finish clearing. Maybe this has the potential to be funky but others do it so much better and there's plenty of other places to try instead!!

Culina is one of Singaporeâ€™s most renown and reputed wholesale meat distributors. They have a snazzy gourmet bistro retail concept in Dempsey, as well as many butcheries within various NTUC Fairprice. Culina focuses mainly on Australian beef.The fun part is where you can choose any of their glorious selection of meats from the butchery, then just pay an additional cooking fee.Although my only gripe is that they don't serve soft drinks (I wanted a damn coke?), and only serve still/sparkling or wine. A bit pretentious to me and not giving normal folk like me their sugar fix
2
If it could go wrong it did with this visit. Ordered rare steak with fries and vegetables, my friends ordered medium steaks. My steak had to be returned as it was over cooked, 20 mins passed no steak, 2 waitresses asked about the steak another 15 mins my friends have now finished eating, my chips are cold. I resort to going to the kitchen myself. To add to the pain they then wanted to charge me as if it had been right first time so an argument then erupted. I would not risk going back there are too many other good places to eat
5
Great food, well cooked and served with a smile. The restaurant is unpretentious - meat and fish/seafood self selected from the fresh food counter and cooked to your liking. Wine by the glass or you can select a bottle from the winestore. They have a great range of fresh salads and interesting canned foods as well as frozen delicacies and yummy chocolate in the adjoining deli. I like sitting outside on the verandah watching the world go by. Well worth a visit
5
This is a real delight for a totally relaxed lunch or supper.Aside from the short but well thought out menu you can choose your steak from the butchery counter and they will cook it for you.Wine too can be bought off the list or by browsing in the attached shop and for which you pay a fair corkage charge.We had delicious oysters-easily the best in Singapore-and perfectly judged pasta with crabmeat and chilli.One friend had a steak which looked good and tasted even better.No wonder he visits every Sunday for a leisurely lunch.This is a great place with a superbFrench(yes French!)manager in charge of a friendly efficient team.Highly recommended

Great place for lunch more than diner
Moules Frites are good, steak sandwich as well and also salads, etc
You may pick your meat from the grocery shop
Staff provide a good service
One of my fav place for a saturday lunch
4
Been there a few times.. Fresh food n never been disappointed. We chose the items n they'll cooked it. Price is a bit on a higher side but it's worth. Good selections on wine list as well.
4
Was there for lunch in October. They have a supermarket next to the restaurant.The interior decor is simple yet elegant and the staff were attentive, helpful and always with a smile. They respect personal space and do not rush you into anything.Although the food selection is average, the orders we had were delicious and very presentable. The only draw back would be that the location is rather inconvenient if you do not drive.I will recommend this place especially if you can do long lunches as the restaurant and service staff just make your dining experience perfect
4
Recently refurbished yet remains good value for money especially at lunch time. The steak sandwich is excellent and their wagyu burger is equally good. My wife enjoys the duck confit and there is a wide range of salads.The selection of wines is varied and well priced. I particularly like the concept whereby you can purchase a wide range of difficult to come by delicacies and fresh produce under the same roof as the restaurant.There is a friendly atmosphere and the staff are attentive
4
This is a mix use venue that allows you to purchase some of the finest meats, produce & other imported items not typically found anywhere else in Singapore. They have an impressive retail wine collection from across the world. A wine can be found at a reasonable price to suite nearly all pallates.The outdoor sofa seating is my preferred location.They also have a discount for American Express card holders when purchasing items in the retail area
3
This is an area popular among the western expatriates. In recent years more retailers have converted their floor space to offer both grocery shopping and casual dinning all under one roof. Huber's Butchery, Jones the Grocer, and our favorite Culina are some of them. Besides this retail arm, Culina is also the distributor of fine quality food and wine to restaurants, hotels, cafes and highend supermarkets in town. We shop here regularly for gourmet groceries, old and new world wines and seasonal delicatessens whenever we have a dinner party. The Bristol is a conducive place for tea or casual lunch with friends - unpretentious, comfortable and relaxing, with good quality ingredients for sure
4
Nice informal place for lunch and dinner. I like the concept that you can buy the wine in the shop and have it served for lunch at a small corkage charge. They have quite an iconic wine selection of brands that you do not see elsewhere, and the prices (by Singapore Standards) are quite reasonable. The food generally is simple and good made from top class ingredients also sold behind the counter. I had a sandwich for lunch, which was so tender and tasty that it was shared. Service can be improved, but once we had ordered, the food came without delay
5
Delicious food, charming and efficient service, quality ingredients, lovely and fun atmosphere, what else could you ask for in a restaurant. Culina is definitely my favourite restaurant in Singapore. You leave happy and satisfied without having to empty your whole wallet. I love being able to purchase some ingredients and wine after dinner so I can take them home and try them out myself. WIll visit Culina regularly. Don't waste your money elsewhere when you can have a wonderful meal here. One tip...maybe book a cab in advance, as you will want to drink the delicious, very reasonably priced wine, and getting a taxi at Dempsey Hill can be very tricky
4
Culina has recently had a renovation & I am glade to see its still good, fresh and tasty. Not only do they have a great wine selection its fantastic to be able to buy the wine you had afterwards from their shop (that includes most of the food you have eaten). A great place to go on your own, with friends, on a date or even a business meeting. It never disappoints

We like to choose Dempsey for eating out because the car parking situation is easy, who needs stress like car parking?We have been to many (similar) places in Dempsey -- eg, without naming names: we've been a number of times to that pricey steak place diagonally across the road; that Aussie brekky place at the neighbouring corner; that electic-frenchy-decor place set amongst the trees down the road that we go to 2nd most frequently; that pasta and pizza place next door to the art gallery in the same block as the aussie brekky place; that hip housey place down the stairs that loves serving truffled fries -- Culina always ends up being our 'ol faithful'. It is no exageration that whenever we want to have a dinner meal out, we just say, "Let's go to Culina."We do not come to Culina for a special night out. It is a bistro, not a special-occasion restaurant. Culina is a place to drop in for a casual, good feed. We never make reservations, and if there are no tables, on infrequent occasions, we just prop ourselves at the bar and have our wine and dinner there. Too easy! The wine selection by the glass is good to begin the mood with. The gnocchi with duck ragout and mushrooms is always satisfying, always a winner, always puts a smile on my face; I hope they never take this item off the menu. The last time I had this gnocchi, it was too oily. But that was an aberration, because it is usually perfect. There might have been a replacement cook in the kitchen that night. If the over-oiliness happens again however, I will say something to the staffThe other always-delicious main course dishes are: the 1824 beef cheeks, the beef onglet, the duck leg confit, the duck breast, and the pork dish. Their menu goes through mild changes every so often. For example, the steak tartare disappeared, but reappeared again a few months ago. Another example: currently, the beef onglet and the pork dish are off the menu.Please don't go to Culina expecting a restaurant-type night out, like you would in a restaurant with white table cloths. Culina is a bistro (ie, = casual), and by and large, the meals there are tremendously delicious. A note about 'Slow Service': Yes, you have to ask the wait staff for items you want, and may have to remind them. It really is no big deal because they are essentially friendly and happy to oblige.After having finally discovered Culina 2 years ago (a significantly long time after it first opened), and been here many, many times, I will never stop coming here. Culina has become a 'family favourite'
4
Helpful service matched with great steaks and wine list. By Singapore standards I found the wine prices reasonable comparable to my home Australia. Though not a place for an intimate dinner but well worth a visit if you like steaks!
2
very good wine selection albeit a bit overpriced, good selection of food in the supermarket section. That is it. the rest is trashy. Bad food cooked in the style of bad food. Overcooked chicken and fish, dry and overcooked pasta, small portions of salad, inadequately charred steaks. If you complain about the food, they say the head chef is too busy to come out and out trots a young, wet behind the ears, twenty year old 'assistant chef'. Now, what on earth are you going to discuss in culinary terms with a line cook? This is a wonderful location just crying out for a better eating experience. Have been many times, each time hoping there was a new experience in store, but been disappointed each time. This was my last visit, until they improve
1
Did not eat here but bought a couple of packets of dried pasta at the deli in dempsey. First 2 packs were ok but the last packet was full of weevils. I counted at least 10 when I poured a cupful of pasta onto my plate before cooking. Brought the packet of pasta back to the store to alert them so that they can check on the rest of their stock. Was shocked that their staff actually got defensive and said there is nothing they can do about it!!! C'mon, such indifference is shocking for a supposed purveyor of fine food, the least they can do is to check the rest of their pasta to make sure they did not get a batch of bad pasta from their supplier! Staff at the cashier are very poorly trained, no apology was offered. I was not even asking for an exchange or refund. Shocked as I have never encountered weevils in dried pasta and we have pasta at home at least 4 times a week.
1
Service is awful ... we went in on a sat evening , a long haired waitress told us last order is 9.30 , I pointed to her its 9.10 now, she said she will check with the kitchen .She spoke a Chinese guy at what is suppose to be the kitchen counter and she then she went to another girl ..all along sulking and making contorted faces. By then we felt its not a place we wnat to have diner if service is such . I wonder if the owners are so wealthy they dont need business and if they close at 9.30 on a saturday evenin
4
I am very satisfied with great quality of food and wine at Culina. We had oysters. Very fresh, very yummy. Then, selected some cuts we wanted. Medium rare is perfect and serving with herbal butter and Brussels sprouts as a side dish. The wine collection is great and varied from medium price to hight end. I had profiteroles and that was great too. Definitely is on my short list for great food
4
Nice atmosphere and concept. Food very very nice ...I certainly now know where to go to get my fix of nicely cooked NZ lamb! In fact all our meals were perfectly cooked and thoroughly enjoyed. Service was ok, I think focus on diners sitting at tables taken away by those heading up to the meat counter ... resulted in our bottle of Tattinger sitting on our table unopened for quite some time! Desserts were divine. This was my second visit and certainly won't be my last
5
We came regularly to Culina, we usually came as a Family and sometimes we invited friends and even I made business meeting there while having lunch.One thing that made Culina Stand Out as one of the Best Resto in Singapore where choises almost unlimited bwcause it has a inique concept while serving only the best quality food.While browsing around for our favorite items to stock for our kitchen at home; we can end up our day relaxing indoor or outdoor tables enjoying variety of seafood, steak, etc which the ingredients you choose it and pick by your own or through the list on the menus.My latest fav was Clams freshly Air flown.Sip it with Pinot Noir which plenty of choices in Culina and have a great time chatting with Wonderful Staff and much helpful Manager who helped me choose my wine and all explanation behind it.It a place to treat our own self, family or friends. Make sure to Make a Reservation if you plan comes with larger group. Francoi

The floor staff are terrible. We arrived at the restaurant and waited a few minutes to be served. Another party without a reservation (they clearly said so) arrived behind us and guess what? They got served first! The difference between their party and mine? That party was Caucasian and mine was not. It's a shame that in this day and age, our own Asian staff discriminate like that. The manager who I believe noticed this came out quickly to offer us a table and when I told him that we had come first but got served later, he didn't apologize but still offered to show us to a table. It's sad that in this day and age that this occurs. We are transparent and 2nd class in our own country. Would I go back again? Guess not.
4
Went to the Culina for a reunion with ex colleagues. I was there early and asked one of the waitress if there was a reservation. She will not particularly attentive or helpful. I was left standing alone. When my friends came, we were showed to our table by another waiter. We ordered a sample platter and was pleasantly surprised by the selection of cold cuts. They were very good. One of my friends order a 1824 steak. He found the steak excellent. My two other friends ordered fish. Again, they were simply excellent. I ordered the spinach plus quail. Very very good. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised by the excellent food. We tried several times to catch the waiter's and waitress's attention for water and dessert menu. After sometime, we were able to. When the desserts finally came, again, they were excellent. I would go there again for the food. But I wish the owner will improve the service and attention level of the waiting staff.Prices: A little on the high side. If you buy wine from the restaurant, you will be charged S$15/bottle. If you BYO, you will be charged S$50.. That, to me, is a little hefty
5
The fresh oysters, steak, cheese, foie gras, sashimi crab and wide selection of wines were all excellent. The steak melted in our mouths and the sashimi crab meat was a new experience. The foie gras was large, larger then any restaurants I have ever eaten in. The price was very reasonable consider the amount and quality of food. This will be a regular restaurant we go to each time we are in Singapore
