The price is affordable, not to expensive, what you ate in Indonesia you can find it here, ate here with my family for ramadhan you should try it too! But need reservation

The restaurant is spacious and location is easy accessible. I would recommend the oxtail soup to everyone. It's a must to eat when you visit them.

Like this restaurant. Wide spread of food to chose. Guest from Switzerland enjoy his lunch very much. Amaze by the spread, cannot find such delicious cuisine back home. Glad we made a good choice to bring him to this restaurant.

This restaurant is located near to Arab Street and Sultan Mosque. It serves Minang or Padang food and open from 10 AM. The food taste was authentic Minang. The place was clean and the ambience was not bad.

A friend from Indonesia wanted to have Indonesian meal for lunch and headed to Sari Ratu near Arab Street.Typical Indonesian menu offerings. We ordered Chicken and Fish entree with rice and drinks.Food in general taste a little sweet. Small restaurant with average ventilation.Food price is slightly higher than nearby restaurants.

Wife wanted to eat authentic Indonesian food. After a short search we agreed to go to Sari Ratu in Pahang Street. Its a rather large place, with tables outside too and also pretty modest, so all attention is on the food.Choice is more than good and all the dishes we tried were fantastic!If you like Indonesian and spicy food for very reasonable prices, this is your place

My wife and I frequented Sari Ratu when we visited Jakarta at the basement of Plaza Senayan to makan Nasi Padang many years ago. Today, it is so easy just drive over to 20 Pahang Street.What is it so different? There are variasi food is served hot. They use good spices, gives you lots of tasty curry cravy and specially made red and green chilli. We enjoy drinking advocat juice and later El Esler after the meal. Come and eat at Sari Ratu for lunch and dinner with parking along the road - remember to put enough parking coupons because you can get carried away with good food and desserts

A wide array of dishes to choose from. The fried chicken was dry and uneventful dish. The hard boiled egg was lovely with accompanied sambal. Beeef heart was crispy, both sayur were pedestrian. The highlight was the beef tendon in curry which was awesome, good texture and flavor. We also ordered both green and red sambal which were nice without being sweet. Overall a nice lunch but did not impress.

We missed our Nasi Padang at Seri Ratu in Jakarta and was recommended to this venue in Singapore. We realised it was not the same outfit when we arrived for early lunch. The small air-conditioned restaurant presented a wide variety of familiar Minang dishes in a long counter. All the food were attractively delicious. Prices were also reasonable and just slightly higher than the food courts.We ordered a wide variety of meats and vegetables to cover a table including the beef rendang, beef tendon, fried chicken, curry stingray, mutton curry, fried potato and stir-fried vegetables accompanied by steamed rice. There was nothing to fault with the cooking and everything tasted fine. However they just lacked the same exciting flavors that drew us back to Jakarta's Seri Ratu again and again

Hosted my company lunch there and left the restaurant a customer. Food is consistently good and variety is wide. Service was attentive and prompt. Prices are reasonable. Will definitely be back.

The food are delicious if u tend to feel to eat Indonesia style that is call. Nasi Padang plus the place are clean & enjoying moments for eating lunch & dinner.
5
Excellent for lunch and dinner, the taste is the same as the ones in Jakarta- indonesia. Consistent, friendly service.This is a semi fast food restaurant. Food is fresh and tasty.
5
The food is really tasty and delicious. It is halal food close to Arab street. The price is also reasonable. I recommend this restaurant for those who want halal food

I returned to Sari Ratu for lunch as I had deemed it the best for Nasi Padang. However, the quality of the food has fallen below expectations. I ordered the rendang, omelette and sayur lodeh. Despite my request for more tender pieces of rendang, I was given pieces that were so tough that chewing became a chore. The rendang tasted like leftovers from the night before. I informed the waiter about it and he merely said he would inform the chef. There was no attempt to recover, unlike in previous occasions. The omelette was also a disappointment because it was rather tasteless although it looked delicious. No reason to be back again

Nasi Padang is a Padang steamed rice served with various choices of pre-cooked dishes originated from Padang city, the capital of West Sumatra, Indonesia.At Sari Ratu, I found authentic nasi padang with a good variety of pre-cooked dishes to choose from.The chilli dishes are spicy hot and delicious.The price, though, is a bit on the high side but for an occasional treat, it is worth the visit
4
We did a 5-pax family dinner there last Sunday. We arrived at 8:15pm and there were tables galore. We must have been late because most of the popular items like Ikan Asam Pedas, Ayam Goreng, Sambal Udang and Sambal Telor were already sold out. We did get to try the Sup Buntut, Kari Ayam, Sayur Lodeh, Daun Sinkong, Telor Goreng and Sambal Hijau. All the items were excellent and the service was prompt and efficient. The service staff were friendly and accommodated our requests happily. Best of all, the prices are reasonable by Singapore standards. We should be returning fairly soon

I'm a bit picky about food, especially Indonesian. Having grown up in Jakarta, I've always liked the taste of the food there. I do miss authentic Indonesian food in Singapore, and would occasionally try out the Indonesian food here (food-hopping).When I first ate here, it tasted so much different from the other Malay version of nasi padang. Definitely reminds me of Indonesia. They do not serve the dishes all on small plates here and have them spread out on the table. You have to pick which dishes you want, separated on plates or mixed in one plate. I think it's more hygienic that way.The place is fully air-conditioned, well-lit and there's outdoor dining too. Might be able to house about 30-40 customers indoor & 16 outdoor. Atmosphere is kind of quiet if you sit outside.The most I've spent alone here is about S$15 with 3 side dishes of Rendang, Gulai Kikil, vegetables and a Teh Botol (plastic bottle).The one I went to is at Pahang Street, near Arab Street, a place of heritage. So after having my tummy filled, I would stroll around the area to 'lighten up'. The place is also near Bugis. Actually in between Bugis and Lavender MRT Stations, so you can drop by at any of the stations and have a 10-min walk to go there.There's another one at Lucky Plaza, Orchard Road though, but it's quite a small and the area can be quite hectic there.They close at 10pm. However, if you come later than 7pm, you might miss out on other dishes.I recommend this place for authentic Indonesian Nasi Padang with a cozy atmosphere. Do give it a try

Coming to Singapore as moslem foreigner would cause a big headache to find halal food to consume.Sari Ratu serves an authentic Indonesian ( Padang ) food that really fulfill our appetite.It is also located nearby one of the biggest mosque in Singapore where we usually go for praying.We love Sari Ratu.
4
The place I always go is the one in Lucky Plaza, this is where Padang food tastes right but the price is a bit high compare to Padang at Hawker centre but still better than Food Republic Padang stall at ION. Whenever my boys and I feel like Padang food, we won't go anywhere else
3
be careful wat u order, not ordinary priced items, u guess wats the $ of bagedil? the kikil for one portion is $5, the green and red sambal is charged separately...but then if u must eat nasi padang....then dont complain lar
4
I'm having dinner at the 1 in lucky plaza. Clean place. As most of the menu is with santan coconut so I order veggies only. No taste at all but pepper. Not sure if recommended.

Compared to what I used to eat as a a broken college student in Indonesia back in 90's, quality and presentation here was far better. Each dish was done right without overdone. Staff were kind and attentive. Not fancy but clean. Rendang (my absolute favorite) was tender and flavorful, Ikan Gulai came with a big chunk of fish. Vegetable dishes tasted fresh and not too salty. I particularly liked the salty tiny fish and red chili.I went there twice, and discovered that rice, tea, and vegetable dishes were between SGD 1 - 1.5 range, while meat and fish could go above SGD 4. This means if you order regular amount like rice, 2-3 veges, 1 fish or meat and tea, it'll be around SGD 10. They don't have any price or item descriptions for each plate, so you'll need to ask if you want to know what you are getting or how much it will end up. This might be a bummer for some people like tourists. But once figuring it out, it's a great place to become their repeated customer

There are many restaurants in Singapore serving Padang food, but most of them served dishes that already influenced by Malay taste. If you appreciate authenticity, this is one of the rare places in Singapore that serves the original Padang food that taste closest to what they serve in Padang, Sumatra island, Indonesia.I believe they use spices from original recipes, not substituted by Malay equivalent ingredients. They also provide dining area with AC (which is VERY comforting in Singapore). That's probably why the price is higher than common Padang restaurant in Singapore.

Nice and cosy place. Was recommend this restaurant by a Malay colleague. Basically the food is displayed behind a glass counter and you just pick the dishes to go with your rice. The beef rendang was good - moist and not overly spicy. As to be expected of good Nasi Padang, it's a tad pricey.
1
By far the most expensive lunch I had in any food stall that serves malay or Indonesian food. SGD25 for 2 person is ridiculous considering I did not order any meat, fish or chicken. Me and my friend only had vegetables and Bandung and mineral water for drink
5
My family loves this place. Once a while, we will come here to eat when we crave for some Indonesian style of cooking. Prices are affordable but when you're truly satisfied with the food, the bill is just a secondary matter. Excellent service provided by staff. Efficient. One thing that could dampen the mood is the availability of empty seats. It'll be better if they expanded the restaurant

Sari Ratu Singapore is Basic, been part of a chain, itâ€™s simple, with no frills. Extremely Indonesian Flavoured cooking at its best. The chicken rendang, and their fish head curry was simply amazing. The Service was basic but cheery and most polite, service was fast and the waiters attentive. The atmosphere is cosy as the place is rather small, and the decor more like a cafeteria. The staffs speak enough English to tell you what you are eating. Like Hawker Stands, it is surprisingly inexpensive. The final bill was near twenty dollars per head but if you are anywhere near the Arab st quarter, it is certainly worth a visit and it is worth a try if you love the authentic Indonesian food

It's in a secluded area but it was well worth the shot. The variety is just amazing. You could order individual plated or dishes served separately. Each food had it's own distinct flavour and all you could imagine when you imagine Indonesian cuisine. Tasty, cooked well. Went with family for hubby who had been wanting to eat "lung dish" It was delicious. The restaurant was clean, albeit small. Has friendly waiters to serve you and it was just a little more than kopitiam Nasi Padang but it is 10x more delicious. We loved it. It had a prayer room for Muslim Friends too, although Sultan Mosque was also around the corner. =D If u have a thing for Indonesian cuisine, you MUST go to THIS RESTAURANT!!

I've been to Singapore for several times on business trips as well as vacation. I heard about this restaurant for so many times and yet had the chance to try the food here. So for this trip, i tell myself to come here no matter how busy i am. For those who loves Indonesian cuisine, you must come and try the food here. Today i had their signature dish of 'Gulai Tunjang' and 'Ayam Pop'. The prices are reasonable and the food taste so goo

Lots of dishes to choose from for your level of spiciness and heat which was great since we were with kids. Nothing fancy just good essential food which provides a great introduction to Indonesian food.

I lived in Indonesia for 11 years and grew to love Nasi Padang. As most know the quality can be very wide ranging depending on the cook. Sari Ratu is one of the better places in Singapore for good Nasi Padang. Good variety and great taste. The inside seating is limited and the place is popular so you might be eating outside but to me it is worth it

I visited Sari Ratu on 2 Jan with 6 family members (excluding me). I rang the restaurant a day earlier to make a reservation & also inform them that I have someone using a wheelchair & wanted to ensure the place could accommodate her.The lady who took my reservation reminded me several times that I have to be on time or else the table will be given away. I would have appreciated a one time friendly reminder.My reservation was for 1.30pm. On that day, I received a call at 1pm saying my table was given to others . It was surprising because I wasn't even there yet! I had 1/2hr to reach.. Nevertheless, I asked if I will have a table & she said she'll arrange one. The food is EXCELLENT! Simple yet tasty! They have about 15 dishes. Prompt service to serve the dishes! I was so happy with the food that I can get over the reservation mishap.It was my hubby's birthday so we had a cake with us. I approached one of the staff to ask if we can cut the cake at their premises & what they did is indeed excellent service!They discreetly took the cake from me, light up the candles , played the Happy Birthday song & sang along with us!!! Kudos to the service crew!Total bill for the meal =$96Worth the price for 7 pax!! Will definitely revisit & recommend!!

Simple Indonesian restaurant, with delicious local food. As is usual in this kind of restaurant, the food is displayed, and it is possible to make a choice by just pointing at the food. The staff are eager to explain what the food actually is. The mood is relaxed. It is possible to sit outside (directly at the quiet street) or inside (air conditioned). I recommend the Ice Cendol as a delicious desser

Had lunch on 14-Aug-2015 at Lucky Plaza brunch. Order two egg dishes (S$1.50/each) and one curry vegetable(S$1) with rice (S$1), cost me S$5. My Colleague took 4 dishes without rice and it cost her S$9, the chicken drumstick cost S$5. To us the taste is normal, maybe we order "normal" dishes? I won't go back to this expensive restaurant for lunch, I'm just an average salaried worker

It has all the high standard of Padang cuisine (Indonesian). Great taste, wide variety, cool atmosphere and affordable makes this restaurant one of the best Padang restaurants overseas. I was quite surprise when I entered this restaurant and saw a very familiar view of Padang restaurant like anywhere else in Indonesia: an array of wonderful dishes. The red snapper gulai (Gulai Kepala Kakap) served in a big and hot bowl making it more delicious and tastier than ever. A cup of coffee after meal is also a big plus of this restauran

Came here during lunch. The place is obviously doing well, bustling with people. Many were Indonesian so it should be authentic. The place is clean and bright so that is nice. Food is good. In particular I liked the fish curry. A little bit sour taste. So many different types of curry to choose from!

This restaurant sells Indonesian menu , restaurant locations easily accessible . for the Indonesian people , this restaurant sells food menu with the taste and flavor that comes from Indonesia .for travelers who are not from Indonesia , I recommend this restaurant because the menu is delicious

Undeterred by the last unpleasant experience at Sari Ratu Kelana Jaya, I once again visited the same restaurant branch in Singapore, The food presentation and looks are almost the same except that the food here were served hot and fresh. The Rendang and Tunjang which are my favourite were not only well cooked but also very soft and tender.The staff are very attentive with your needs like extra dishes and rice. Very superb service

Spent 20.50 for 2 person. Ordered a portion of Sambal Goreng, Fried Egg, Sayeh Lodeh, a piece of Fried chicken (thigh) & Apokat (Avocado Shake). 2 plates of steam rice.Big eaters will definitely find the portion for the price paid for the dishes way too small.Sambal Goreng and Fried Egg were very salty. The rest were ok but no wow factor.Apokat was nicely blended with swirl of chocolate though I'd wish they put more avocado in it.Bright clean dinning atompshere but your clothes will have the oily smell once you leave the restuatant as the ventilation isn't great
