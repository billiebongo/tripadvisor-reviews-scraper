Sorry to report that this is not only a waste of your time but also your money. Empty place, very poor service with staff not really knowing what they serve. Pasta swamped in greasy sauce. 80 dollars for 2 dishes at lunch... Really???

The place is dead. The food is average. Good place for a date far from the crowd, if you do not mind average quality Italian food.

Scrapes average and very over priced. The other reviews are definitely misleading, this is not a boutique foodie spot.

current management, who are italian, have been in place for a year. i have to think prior poor reviews pertain to previous owners, as my wife and i could not have asked for better service or meals. we were staying at nearby holiday inn express, and went walking to find a restaurant our first night in town. i had a risotto off the menu, and my wife had a pasta with a sauce specially prepared for her taste (tomato-based, no cream). we were served a welcome prosecco on arrival, and an aperitf after dinner. for dessert, my tiramisu and my wife's chocolate gelato were excellent.we were so pleased overall that we booked a table for two nights later, to invite two friends to join us. that meal was even better. the chef/owner made recommendations for starters to share (a mixed vegetable salad, and four large sardines smothered in onions), and main courses (a cod dish and a thre mushroom-based pasta). we had an italian white wine that was a recommendation from off the wine list. all were outstanding, and our guests, singaporeans both, were very pleased with the whole atmosphere and service. the decor is rustic italian, full of paintings hung on the wall, perhaps reflecting the owner's Florence origins

We started with a Pumpkin Soup (Zuppa) - it came in the form of an orange, translucent broth instead of the cream of pumpkin soup we were expecting at most Italian restaurants. It tasted sweet, and there were pumpkin bits; I had to douse mine with a lot of pepper.For mains, I had the Pasta with Clams (Vongole) that was disappointingly bland. Usually vongoles come with a lovely white wine sauce or even if cooked in cream, there would be some taste to it. Unfortunatelyt for this, I just could not detect any flavor so I was chewing on the hard pasta and tasteless clams, adding lots of Tabasco sauce to it for flavor.*Katherine had a Parma Ham Pasta and while this had more flavor to it, paired with rather succulent pieces of ham, she also thought that the pasta was a tad too hard. It was kind of dry as well, without much gravy to it.We did not enjoy our lunch here at all, and would not be back for more.

Celebrated my 25th Wedding Anniversary and my daughter's 17th birthday at the restaurant just last week. Both Chef Silvio and F and B manager, Judy made the celebration extra special for us. The food was authentic Italian, with great Italian champagne and wine to go with it. The ambience was perfect, if you, like me, like privacy. But if you like to party, that can be arranged too. That's what I love about the place and Judy is wonderful. Chef Silvio was fantastic with his recommendations. We truly enjoyed ourselves that night

after weeks of Asian food, I needed a break and I started looking for a European restaurant close to my hotel. I found Gallo D'oro and I was not disappointed. The menu is limited to the essential, simple Italian dishes but exquisitely prepared with a lot of passion by Chef Silvio. The red wine I have been suggested completed perfectly my meal, for a while I really felt like I was in Florence. I would like to highlight the service that made all the difference, and the good time I spent with Chef Silvio discussing about our expat life and all that go with it, enjoying a delicious Limoncello. At Gallo D'oro you'll feel like the client is someone important and if you are keen on chatting with the personnel in an authentic ambient, then you know where to go

I had lunch at this lovely restaurant in 7 Magazine Road #01-03 (Central Mall). Brought my customers for lunch recently. I had BRANZINO ALL'ACQUA PAZZA (Meditterean seabass in fish consomme and julienne vegetables). Chef Silvio told me that this seabass is directly imported fresh from Italy. My customers could smell the sweet aroma of the fish, even though they were seated opposite me! It was probably one of the best fish dishes I have ever eaten. I normally gobble down my lunches in 5 minutes. I took more than 30 minutes to finish this fish because it had plenty of bones (but heck, which fish doesn't have bones!). I enjoyed every minute of this dish. Right to this moment, I can "remember" the taste of the fish! I also had lobster bisque. It was another winner. This restaurant is quiet and nice - with attentive staff. A winner

Had the most wonderful meal on Friday night. This restaurant is a hidden gem. It has the freshest produce and truly interesting Italian food. There are as many daily specials as on the menu depending on what is fresh at the markets that day. What I like also is that they are so accommodating that any dish is available in either appetiser or main size so you can try many dishes tapas style. The chef appears from the kitchen to talk to the guests and discuss the menu
