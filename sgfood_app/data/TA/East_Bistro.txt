Went to try this restaurant as it was near our new house. Tucked in one corner of this alley, East Bistro is a restaurant which serves traditional HK food. They have nice dim sum but not cheap.

Owned by former head chef of the famed Lei Garden, this little eatery serves delicious dim sum and other restaurant favourites at a very reasonable price. Would definitely go again.

The dim sum was good and good value. Service was patchy on the day of visit. As usual, the highlight was the rice crispy soup which was a winner for all our family members.

My wife & I regularly return to visit her family in Singapore.This was recommended to us.You may find it a little far to visit if you are staying in an hotel downtown, but if you are living here, you will find it well-worth checking-out.Whilst the decor is not quite of Orchard Road standard, this is more than compensated by the very warm welcome, quality of the food, & value for money.On our second visit we were treated as old friends

The location is probably not one many tourists will venture to on their own accord, but it's kind of on the way to or from the zoo in Mandai. The food however is worth the journey. Authentic Cantonese cuisine using a wide variety of ingredients and cooking techniques. My personal favourites were the winter melon soup served in an actual winter melon and the crab porridge served with an actual crab inside. This is how Singaporeans treat themselves to a good meal

Small selection but Superb quality of Dim Sum in Sembawang Area. Salted egg custard bun is to die for. Har Kow, Siew Mai is filled with prawn and ingredient. My favour got to be the Beancurd Prawn Roll and Egg Tart. If coming for lunch or dinner, the Pao Fan is a MUST have! Most of the dishes are of hotel restaurant quality with Zhi char price. It is becoming my favourite place to chow when I am in Singapore

Dim sim is good and reasonable pricedThe dishes are also very good, just a tad salty. Service is good for meOne of my visitor is handicapped. The step there is quite big, staff saw that we had trouble and came to assist us , both before and after dining without us asking them for hel

This place is a secret for north siders. The place is comfortable, simple and lovely. The food is by an ex head chef from a reputable restaurant in Singapore.The dimsum are all hand made and really delicately prepared.Try out the fried porridge, it's something special and taste awesome.

My husband and I love the food and we have been visiting them for at least once a week even before we knew the chef helming the kitchen is previously the executive chef at Lei Garden.The specialty Pao Fan is a must try. The Har Gow is filled with 2 fat prawns and the mushroom looking bun filled with char Siew is really good too.They have a 10% discount off dim sum on weekdays!
