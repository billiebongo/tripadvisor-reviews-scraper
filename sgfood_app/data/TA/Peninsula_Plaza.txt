The Hotel should need a total refurnishment . Location for leisure journey but not for business . The skyline is amazing

Grabbed some food to takeaway as it was late afternoon and we hadn't eaten. Not much to choose from but they packaged it to go for us.

Shops did not open until almost lunchtime which was a pity as we had a plane to catch & could not hang around to purchase what we would have liked to!

It can be called Little Myanmar where you can find all sort of Myanmar foods, items, clothings and journals, books and newspapers in one place.

This is an odd place to go - it has a very wide mix of tenants - ranging from shops that sell xxxxxxl clothes to custom tailors to sports stores and sneaker shops not to mention the odd electronic store. You would come here if you have a specific reason - I come here to visit Men's tradition tailor which I find makes decent clothes at a reasonable price - ask for Daniel if you are there.

This Hotel is in a great location. We stayed there along with our two sons, one of whom is Wheelchair bound, and a group of friends. We were a group of nine in total. We arrived early in the morning after a twelve hour flight from Copenhagen. Our rooms were not ready until after two pm, which made it a very long wait especially for my wheelchair bound son, however the rest of our stay more than made up for the long wait. The staff in the Restaurant were very nice to our son, even making him a special breakfast and freshly squeezed juice. We will stay there again

It's funny coz some reviews here are for Plaza Peninsula Hotel ..... Don't they read hahaha anyways Peninsula Plaza is more likely to be the Burmese Haven ( or Myanmarese Haven ) . This is a place were natives from Myanmar ( also known as BURMA ) come to gather , eat , meet their friends Everyday but mostly during Saturday late afternoon and night and Sunday's and of course during public holidays. Walking and just even approaching this building / mall , one can smell the scent of Myanmar Cuisine in an instant. ( I love Burmese and Thai ) . But yeah basement are more on foodcourt there were like 4-8 mini eatery shops and it's always full packed during peak days. There are shops that sells products from Myanmar ( lots of them ) , calling cards , plane tickets to Myanmar , hair salon , Internet stations are all available here . But going back to the Burmese delicacy there a tons & tons of beautiful and very tasty and interesting delicacy of Burmese people that they served here. And you can't say no once you've started to dig in . Must try foods are : WET THAT SIPYAN (pork curry) , Lapheto ( tea leaf salad ) , Minkwayyuet Thoke ( pennyworth salad ) ( a dish that I keep ordering over n over again ), Danbauk ( Myanmar biryani ) ( lovely dish ) , Chin Baung Kyaw ( rosette leaves with bamboo shoots and Chilli ) this is a must order dish .... Eat it with rice ..... Bloody beautiful that's is ...... Once you visit peninsula plaza , it's just a so so place but trust me food there is heaven if you know what to order ..... And if don't have time to go to Myanmar you can buy some souvenirs there as well. Love to visit this place from time to time .... I always do up to now .....
