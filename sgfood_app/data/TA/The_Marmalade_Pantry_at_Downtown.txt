Great ambience but service and food quality can be improved. Except the mushroom risotto which was delicious. Expensive but with the Entertainer App, its worth it

Considering Singapure's prices, this is incredible. Of course it is expensive, but much more affordable than options around this hotel.
Great staff, good choice of drinks, wines and food.

Place was prettily decorated. Surprisingly, this branch is quiet & not fully occupied as compared to Orchard branch. Perhaps that's why 1 of the cupcake was not as fresh...
5
The service was good and they were very accommodative for a vegetarian version of the high tea. The waitress, Fibi was very friendly and kind.

I went to Marmalade Pantry at Oasia Hotel Downtown with my family of ten for Christmas Eve's dinner. Spread is good - the kids love the food, ambience nice and staff courteous. Will go again!

Quite a nice place to hang out with friends after work. However, service could be improved as they were rather slow in taking orders and aren’t as attentive. Regardless, great food!

Had a very satisfying meal here. The lala clam vongole was delicious and just the right level of spiciness. My husband ordered the pork belly and it was very well marinated and juicy. We ended our dinner with a sticky date toffee pudding and it was great too. Love the restaurant ambience, we went on a Monday night and it was quiet and nice. Good for dates

Dropped by for after dinner cakes with my girlfriend. The cakes were certainly attractive, and so we ordered two cakes: smores and red velvet. Looked really pretty, but disappointingly dry. There was also a lack of flavour. Service wasn't very attentive either. The cakes were very affordable ($5 each), but as it is marmalade pantry, we expected more from the quality
2
Went for the Xmas day buffet and except for the turkey & salmon, the food was awful! There was not much choice with the salads, the spaghetti meatball was over cooked till soggy, the Mac & cheese was tasteless, the roast beef was tough like leather and even the cupcakes they are known for were not fragrant. Such a disappointment when the usual a la carte items have pampered our palette with their authentic taste.

Service staff at the Marmalade Pantry offered no greeting when we arrived for breakfast and made no attempt to serve coffee/tea. We had to proceed to the coffee station to serve ourselves. Also, my friend's hairpin was accidentally cleared away by the service staff. Instead of offering an apology, my friend was asked to look for her own hair pin in the rubbish bin by the Restaurant manager

Attentive staff who are willing to cater to special requests in food. Quiet and nice place to catch up with friends.

This place offers bright, spacious and pleasant dining, good food and friendly staff. It’s delightful as a meeting place for large groups and for celebrating special occasions. Conveniently located near offices and close to the Tanjong Pagar MRT station.
5
Love the food at the Marmalade Pantry. Can always count on having a good meal here. Had the mac and cheese and would totally recommend it.
3
Not bad environment but too pricey for the food quality and quantity so not very economical in general
4
Went on a weekend evening, Truffle fries is great. But m quite surprised that their spicy crab pasta is very spicy.
5
Quiet place for high tea. Good to catch up with friends. Cupcake is abit sweet but is soft n nice. Pastries are good.
3
Casual ambience, quite and good for meeting up with friends or business meetings. A lot of space not so crowded.

Those who live in Singapore will know Marmalade Pantry well. We visited the new outlet at the Oasia Hotel Downtown in trendy Tanjong Pagar. The design is as one would expect in a modern, cosmopolitan location - soaring ceilings, open setting yet with a friendly ambience.But what makes this location exceptional is the Manager, Kannan, and his team. We arranged a party for 14 people and from the start Kannan was the consummate professional, made excellent recommendations and was meticulous with fine details that one could easily overlook. In short, Kannan personally made sure the execution was perfect and he even responded to our queries on his day off! Truly amazing and it is obvious his leadership extends to his team who are equally excellent.In short, a great place to meet friends for an excellent meal delivered with great service and smiles. As an executive I would not even hesitate to hold corporate events here!!

Perhaps because it's located at the lobby of a hotel, so it isn't as crowded as other restaurants. It was nice and relaxing plus the staff there were also pleasant... Ordered the carbonara and also had their cupcakes! It was amazing!We also found Innocent Bystander, a moscato that we tried while in Australia being served here. Give it a shot

I usually order the beef papadelle but this time tried the asian fare, hor fun. MP's food standard has always been consistently good. Really liked the branch in Oasia Hotel Downtown because its usually not as crowded compared to their Ion branch. Also, with the entertainer app, we could get 1-for-1 for mains which makes it pretty value for money
4
Place is huge with high ceiling. Very cool vibes and service was attentive since only a few tables were occupied on a weekday. Pasta was al dente with reasonable portion
3
Average hi-tea standard. Limited choice of cupcakes & the savoury items were very limited. We do not take beef & the items to be substituted were very limited.
4
Food is nice but still have room for improvement. The ION Orchard branch food quality is still better than the Downtown branch but they are not available to book in Chope.
4
This is a great place to hang out for lunch, quiet and great service. The food are just average. With the kind of pricing, i expected better quality.
2 main courses, 2 teas and a slice of cake cost us about $90.
3
Nice ambience, good service but the high tea set for 2 pax was below average. Scones over baked, sandwiches dry and too salty, cupcakes too dry.
5
Had the scallop andand prawn bisque pasta n avocado milkshake. Everything was great. Staff was polite and friendly. Great visit!
4
Food presentation was good, service was food, seafood was fresh! Pasta was slightly salty and the ice tea was too sweet for us.
4
Good food options along with great views of the street and neighbourhood. I tried the breakfast at this outlet and found out to be really good.

Having dined at the original Marmalade Pantry in Palais Renaissance and the Ion Orchard branch regularly, I had decided to try out the outlet in Oasia Hotel. The restaurant was really empty, with only two other tables occupied when we were there. This made the atmosphere feel very sterile and not very welcoming.The food was not good. We had gotten the truffle fries as usual to share, the lobster risotto for myself, and my dining partner ordered the pork chop. In comparison to the Ion outlet (same menu), the food fared badly. The truffle fries was not seasoned well, where the truffle flavors were significantly weaker and had much less toppings (shaved Parmesan and sliced truffle). The risotto was rather bland, the shrimps were small, but at least the lobster tasted alright. The pork chops were absolutely disappointing. It was dry, under seasoned, and the plating was quite clumsy.The service here, however, was much better. The lady that served us was very polite, friendly, and knew how to take the initiative to make our dining experience seamless and pleasant.Overall, I'm not a fan of the atmosphere and the quality of the food here but the service was great. Would I return for it? Probably not; I'd rather visit the Ion outlet where the food is consistently good
2
Bad service. Waiters are not attentive at all. Receptionist was on the phone for a long period of time without attending to us when we reached. We have to go to the counter to ask the waiter for taking order and to ask for our bill. Hi tea set we had are average. Except the cup cakes are good.
5
One of the best fusion F&B you can find in Singapore. Excellent food standard with quality. Savour their chef's speciality and you will not be disappointed.

The Marmalade Pantry is the in-house restaurant at the Oasia Hotel Downtown, which we stayed at for one night and had an enjoyable dinner here.
The beef cheek tagliatelle was quite delicious and the service was good.
It is reasonably good value, being mid-high range.
4
We decided to drop by for dessert after our dinner. We ordered a carrot cake and red velvet. The place was not busy and their service was good.
4
Lovely getaway at the lobby of Oasia hotel. Portions are big but we enjoyed the quality of the food.
Error was made by staff but politely rectified by manager on duty.
4
Was there around 1130am for lunch meeting and soon, the entire restaurant was packed. I had the seared scallop and prawn pasta for main and carrot cake for dessert. Both dish were nicely done for my taste bud. Restaurant ambience was simple, clean and relaxing
3
Popped in here for lunch this week and tried the Halibut main course. This was quite tasty but a little on the small side: still hungry afterwards. The pasta options seemed to be slightly larger servings.
3
The location is good, being in the Oasia Hotel which is near the Tanjong Pagar MRT station, Came here for lunch. The noise level is pretty intense as it was pretty full and even though it has high ceiling, I ended up distracted by the table behind me as their voices carried. The service staff aren't very attentive though one trainee was pretty good in refilling the water glasses. Getting their attention to take order and paying the bill took a while. Menu wise, it is not too bad. I like the selection of cakes although I did not try that, every thing on is on the higher end
4
I've been here 4 times now, for both weekdays dinners and weekend brunch!The high ceilings and spaced out tables makes the place feel open and non-claustrophobic. Service has so far been good :) and because they have quite a number of tables, you don't actually have to queue up. They serve decent brunch at an affordable price. Favourite dish would have to be their truffle fries. Not stingy on the truffle/oil, hope this doesn't change!
3
Ideal location for a quick business lunch as it is a 8 minutes walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT station. This is an all day dining cafe on the ground floor of Oasia Hotel, right next to the lobby. Nice ambience with good food and service. Do try their cakes as they are sumptuous
5
We ate here for 3 cons days breakfast. they have enough variety of foods, taste good and attentive experienced employees.We've tried their Linguine spicy crabmeat also, taste nice even though we ordered it for supper. The restaurant's team hospitality make us felt like home, esspecially for us who stayed 17 days in the hotel. Thx mr Kenneth and chef Tan for the warmness and their attention to detail and to all the restaurant's team who we can't mention one by one. All the best
