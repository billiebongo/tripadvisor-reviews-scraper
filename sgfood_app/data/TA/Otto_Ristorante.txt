Absolutely fantastic food and brilliant customer service. Friendly staff and beautiful atmosphere.
Totally delicious food.

We had the lunch menu. Excellent food. Excellent service which is hard to find in Singapore
No specials on the drinks for lunch time which is a bit disappointing but overall a very nice meal.
5
from the pre-dinner drink, to the starter, mains, dessert, wines, limoncello, grappa... everything was perfect. service was excellent. ambience was calm. i really had a wonderful dinner.
my favourite were the bresaola, burrata and veal ravioli.
5
If you can get in go! The food is really very very good and the atmosphere a bit sophisticated but comfortable. They have an eclectic and large selection of fine Italian wines. I just wish I wasn’t leaving so I could return tonight.
5
Had a nice dinner at Otto - homemade Tagliatelli with black truffle (yum) and a starter of spinach and cheese in flaky pastry. Very good food, excellent service (not usual in Singapore). Location is not easy to find as the entrance is at the back of an office building. Not cheap by any standard but great foo

Excellent degustation menu:Yellow tail tartare was a bit too lemon for meWaguy beef carpaccio: nice presentation and very yummyFoie gras was perfectly cookedSeafood soup was so tastySea urchin bottarga spaghetti was fantastic and finally the beef was just perfect.It was a very long time that I haven ‘t been there but I will definitely go back and in a short while..
1
Went to Otto for what turned out to be a disappointing lunch. The food was served cold, and was dismal compared to when they first opened shop. Pasta sauce was diluted and the pasta was not even al dente. As for the service, the servers appeared disinterested and distracted. It took some effort on our part just to get their attention. For the prices they charge, you are better off going to another fine dining establishment. Will not return

It was my first time here and I was curious. Of course, one would expect the quality and service to be good, given the sort of crowd likely to come and dine, but that cannot be taken for granted.Good range of selections for the three course set ($38). I had the tuna with onions capers and tomatoes, which perhaps was the wrong choice, but still tasty. My companions's parma ham wrap looked more tantalising though. For mains, said companion again cleverly chose the veal tortellini, less invitingly, I had the baked cod (which the waiter confessed had already been prepared) - in a sort of fragrant broth, but still rather well executed. Dessert was the disciplined lime/passionfruit sorbet, although if one were more indulgent one might try the green apple crumble. All in a good experience. I would return to sample the other things I did not have on this occasion
5
I was at a corporate dinner in one of their private dining rooms, with a set "taster menu". All things that would normally condemn the meal to the non-memorable category. But I am happy to report that the quality was excellent throughout. I havent been to Otto for a while - and I remember it being good - but not this good. Service was informed and friendly, and efficient without being overbearing.I didnt pay (lucky me) but I doubt it was cheap. However its easy to pay a lot for indifferent outcomes in Singapore so I will be back on my own dime
5
Really exceptional Italian restaurant. Probably one of the most authentic Italian treats I have experienced in Asia, and real Italian tastes. Products are freshly imported. I loved the pasta, white truffle had just arrived (expensive...outrageous truffle...) but sublime.Well done. We also had a gathering with office colleagues in a separate room, it was fantastic
5
This was a great choice for a business dinner. Had a small private room for our party of 6. Food was incredible and service was excellent. It was a little pricey.
4
Lovely place , visited many times , been around for years , nice setting with wonderful food and great service , really good for lunch and dinner always consistant , will be back
3
I had a business lunch at Otto. The lunch menu is nice and the service is efficient but the food was disappointing apart from the pasta. The prices are on the high side for the quality. Average overall.
4
Ordered the set lunch menu as we were in a hurry. Good value for $38++ ph. The starter was good (both the beetroot and the crab). Unfortunately the lamb shank main was very disappointing- served lukewarm, overcooked and lacking flavour. Deserts were good.
5
Simply excellent Italian food with very good service. Very authentic dishes and I highly recommend the place
4
Nice ambiance with room in the dark tone. Attentive service. Dish well presented with pleasant plating.We took the degustation menu. Tenderloin and pasta were really excellent. Seafood soup also good. Unfortunate that the carpaccio has been so average.We did not have a look at the wine list as we could have ours.Still a very good dinner experience
5
Excellent food, top notch service, great ambience. I will definitely be back. Scialatielli al Kamut con Astice al Vino Bianco e Pomodorini al FornoHomemade Kamut Scialatielli with Boston lobster White Wine Sauce $42++Absolutely heavenly. Scialatielli is not one for those who gets full easily. I personally do enjoy its starchyness, but this is something that needs to be said for those who are unfamiliar with it. I mean, just look at how thick & doughy it is! The chunks of lobster were well cooked, sufficiently bouncy yet not rubbery. & with the white wine sauce that gently flavours the whole dish, this one is a winner for me. Spaghetti ai Ricci di Mare e Bottarga di CabrasSpaghetti with Sea Urchin and Sardinia Grey Mullet Bottarga $32++Was warned this might be a bit salty, but it wasn't at all for me. A harmonious mix of umami & creamy, this was very divine. I had no qualms about not having any chunky ingredients to chee on with the spaghetti, because the spaghetti was so al dente, bouncy & flavourful, I didn't need any extra ingredients (e.g. meat, mushrooms, vegetables, etc) to give it any more texture.Crostata alle Mele e Pinoli con Gelato alla Vaniglia e Salsa alla CannellaApple and Pine Nut Crumble with Vanilla Ice Cream and Cinnamon Sauce $16++This was worth the 30 minute wait! I hereby vote that all apple crumbles have pine nuts in them, because it gives such great texture to it. The apples aren't too tart nor too sweet I only wish there were more vanilla ice cream to go with this!! Tiramisu’ alla Maniera di OTTOGiamaica Coffee Tiramisu’ OTTO$16++Creamy, & light, chocolatey in all the right places. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste much of the liquor inside, so I'm not sure if I'd order this again.

We celebrated my friend’s post wedding event here. Had a private room that sat 12 pax and there was one for one arrangement to reduce corkage fees. We tried the beef carpaccio, smoked Boston Lobster with green peas and white wine (great!), Livorno style seafood soup, pasta Orecchiette with broccoli and spicy sausages, Cote de Beouf and dessert selection. Excellent service and ambience.
5
We had a lovely luncheon meeting, the food was well served with in the right temperature and Italian flavours. No doubt the Chef was practiced in Italy. We used the privet room and got the right atmosphere for the meeting and the service was super. Recommended for business luncheon.
5
Probably about the 3rd or 4th time I have been there. Each time has been a work related dinner or lunch. Pretty sure one of my colleagues has shares in the place. Food and service are always excellent. They had been forewarned re my issue with gluten and they made GF fresh pasta for me for my pasta course. Selection of starts were great- special mention re the asparagus. My main of beef was tender and delicious albeit small- which was fine given the appetisers and pasta which came before it. Crème brulee was delicious way to finish up
5
The staff is very friendly, the dining room is beautiful and welcoming you ... the food is great, we had burrata and monkfish with a glass of great red Sicilian wine.
Certainly a place to return over and over
4
First night in Singapore, we enjoyed an authentic Italian dinner. Service, starters, main course and of course the wine, all were excellent.
5
Had a fantastic dinner with friends and really enjoyed our stay. Michele, the manager, really made us feel at home! Definitely not the last time I visited.
5
Otto Ristorante could well be one of the most authentic places to sample the beautiful Italian cuisines in Singapore.We came to the restaurant to celebrate birthday with friends and came out happy and satisfied.The place was more modern and yet not overdone. The menu was sumptuous and the wine list was comprehensive. Service was professional.More importantly the dishes which truly let the ingredients speak with the right cooking methods. The antipasti of burrata, salad, and carpaccio were fresh and flavorsome, while the main dish of beef and bone marrow was just spot on. Desserts were lovely.We thoroughly enjoyed the evening and would come back with no hesitation
5
We enjoyed a relaxing evening with friends at Otto. The food was delicious. We especially enjoyed the seared Hokkaido scallop and crispy vegetables and tomino cheese strudel for appetizers. The osso bucco was excellent as was the cod. If you are a chocolate lover, do not miss the warm chocolate cake with Haitian vanilla ice cream! The service is superb. When we needed anything, someone magically appeared. Timing was great - we weren't pressured to choose or eat quickly. We were able to linger through a lovely meal, chatting happily away, enjoying the company, food, and service
5
I have visited Otto numerous times and I was never once disappointed with the food.The recent degustation menu was so good that I went back for the same one 3 times in a month.I have also tried some of their dishes from their a la carte menu on other occasions and they were all excellent.The service from the staff were generally very good except we found the chef's attitude towards non-westerners was rather indifferent. Even if he comes by to our table it will only be a hi and bye where else he would have a lot to talk to other Caucasian diners. This happened on several occasions. Luckily the rest of the staff's good service have made up for the chef's cold attitude towards Asians. If the chef is a lot friendlier to Asians I believe their business will improve further. One of my friend did not want to go back to this restaurant for this reason. All he want is equal treatment. The chef doesn't need to be extra friendly to us.As for me so long as the food and service from the staff is good I am OK
5
I came here for dinner and would recommend anyone to have the $98pp degustation menu. For 6 courses, this is great value for money and you are not rushed between courses at all (in fact, we spent almost 3 hours here). The service was great and all of the staff were extremely friendly and professional. The ambiance and atmosphere is very elegant and sophisticated. I would definitely return
5
This is a great restaurant I have been loyal to over 10 years. Never once did the food disappoint. The chef and the manager are the same since opening, and most of the staff has remained, and the service is the best I have experienced in Singapore. Do not miss seasonal dishes, such as truffles in autumn/winter, or white asparagus in spring
5
Fine Italian food in an elegant environment. The dishes are traditional but presented in a fine way. I usually go there at lunch with clients. It is a perfect environment for business talks. There is a room that you can book if you need privacy. The selection of bread is good. Wine too.
5
We have been visiting this place for the last few years, whenever we feel like enjoying divine Italian cuisines. It was Wednesday evening, we brought 2 bottles of wine to enjoy their FREE corkage night. The 6-course degustation is 98++ per head , all inclusive (unlike some restaurants, if you want a good piece of meat or cheese you have to pay additional money). The meal plan is perfect, ingredient is top of class, every dish is carefully concerted to perfection without too much non-eatable artistic decorations. I don't feel over gorged at the end. So clean and neat! Service, food, ambience as usual was very pleasant. We had another wonderful time. Highly recommended for anyone who enjoy delightful Italian cooking
5
For those amongst us with little time on our hands and a tasty appetite for excellent Italian dishes, good noon place to be.
Affluent staff (not always a given in Singapore...!) and friendly service
Definitely a "go again"!
3
I like the ambience here and also the service. They are very attentive and nice.
Food wise is quite average. Nothing impressive.
5
A great service and excellent food. It's worth a visit and one of the very good restaurant in singapore.
5
Have been at Otto three times, and there is consistency of service, quality of food and ambiance.
The meats are very well cooked, quality sources. The pastas and soups are well home made.
Good for business meetings or bringing your partner.
Will be back
5
I had the set festive menu and every dish was very tasty and presented very well too. Service was equally good. Good choice of wines too.
5
Delicious Italian food and wine. Quite luxurious. Truly enjoyed the carpaccio and burrata. The spaghetti with sea urchin was good, the pasta was perfect, but I was looking for a little more flavor from the sea. The beef tenderloin was incredible. The wine list is also well thought out and deep. This is a great spot for Italian food in Singapore.
5
Attended a dinner hosted by the bank. Food & wine pairing was set & arranged by Maitre'd for 4 courses from anti-pasti to dolci. Service was great , food was well perpared & presented course by course. Would like to try again on my own to explore more 
5
After all these years still one of the best places for Italian in Singapore. Hard to go wrong with anything on the menu and anything can be customized if you need to cater for a certain diet or just want a taste of everything or some things more than others. Warm and efficient staff and the Italian owners are always present to ensure you are throughly satisfied.
3
This is a happening place with contemporary decor and a very spacious washroom. The service is attentive and friendly. Chef Michele has a great sense of humour and connects well with his regular customers. The Wagyu Beef carpaccio was balanced and good. He cooked a good crispy suckling pig, fragrant, with it's skin a beautiful light crisp, very crunchy to the bite. His Pasta with Umi sauce n Bottarga was edible. Most unexpected was the poor quality of the truffles he carefully weighed on the table and served on our pasta - the truffles were totally flat and had no fragrance!
4
We were there for a business dinner and booked a private room for the occasion.The service was impeccable and the staff was very professional and non-intrusive during our dinner discussions. The menu was specially selected for our guests different dietary choices but delicious. Try the squid ink pasta - absolutely superb and the best I have eaten in Singapore and Australia.We had the minestrone soup and beef carpaccio as starters that were very good as well. However. the desserts were so-so and nothing memorable. The restaurant is a bit pricey but worth the dining experience and the good food.
4
Went here with a group of friends private dining. Food was fab and service good, but on the margin of too expensive. I'd give it a go if budget isn't important!
5
Nothing to say but great food , Black truffles e pasta .....Vino and we had a Slab of steak that was prepared for our party of five. Will return for more .
1
Very disappointing. The food was uninteresting and the prices at the very high end. Slightly silly Italian affectation in the staff and otherwise unexciting evening aside from the bill.
5
This restaurant is slightly off the tourist beaten track, in the business district of Singapore, but well worth the visit. Very stylish decor, it has an impressive array of wines, with a menu to match and delicious tastes .
3
We went there for business lunch. Great value for money and delicious food. BUT, environment was just too noisy because too packed, could hardly talk to each other while we booked with email confirmation 2 weeks in advance but the restaurant did not take note of it assigning us to a poor location table. Poor organization it seems.Great food but when so noisy the experience is like eating at a McDonalds. Disappointing!
5
Probably the best Italian food I have had outside of Italy. The chef here is world class, very attentive service, menu often updated. Has become one my favorites not just in Singapore, but anywhere for that matter. Try the beef carpaccio, it's incredible, as is the lobster linguine. Highly recommended.
5
Just a little note to say that for our first date, i was invited by a charming gentleman to Otto! Received like a princess! dined and wined like a queen! had an amazing evening! My date can take most of the credit...but Otto helped make it an 10 on my chart! Bravo e arrivederci!
5
An awesome evening with awesome food.Had the gourmet menu. Every dish was really good. Right size, right price and right taste.I also really enjoyed the fact that the guests were a mix of Italians and locals. When visiting an Italian restaurant it is always a quality stamp that many of the guests are in fact Italian. When in Rome... :-)The staff were very attentive and friendly. The only minus was the aircon. It was too cold inside. So remember a jacket or something to keep you warm. I will never understand why this is necessary to cool so much
5
I've been here with my friend before leaving Singapore was my second times and i think is one of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. The General manager (Paolo) and the Restaurant manager (Michele) were so kind with us, they offer welcome aperitivo Aperol Spritz. We chosen two starter and two main course , the small pork (maialino) must try was superb, plus one dessert to share . We chosen a bottle of Sicilian White wine(105$), and after that a couple of nice red wine (24$ per glass). The ambience was rich and elegant. I strongly recommend this fine dinning restaurant for specials occasions. Of course we spent a lot , but we had a great experience. Thank you Guy
5
It hard to find vegetarian food, especially course meal in restaurants but I've had the best vegetarian meal in Otto! The food portioning was just nice and the food was delicious! Their service was top notch! will definitely recommend this place, my friends and I had an enjoyable night here
5
I had a couple of business dinner there and the service was excellent , staff very skilled and the quality of the food was great. Must try ! Buon Appetito !
5
One of the best Italian restaurants I've tried in Singapore. The service was great and the food fantastic. The black truffle were in generous serving and each dish we ordered were done to perfection. Definitely would want to come back again!
4
Had lunch with 3 others here. Hadn't been to this new venue so was keen to give it a t. Food was excellent. The buratawhich we shared was wonderful andI the codfish wrapped in Parma ham which I had I would recommend highly. The place was a little noisy as it was pretty crowded
5
I have not been back to Otto for a long time. It was because of the BYO free corkage last nite that we went as we always prefer to bring our own wine if we can. The pastas were delicious and their meats were very generous in portion. Must order is the bottarga/uni pasta and their ravioli. For meats, the suckling pig was crispy and yummy. My husband's veal was delicious and my daughter loved her pigeon! All excellent. Great music in back ground too
4
One of the best Italian restaurants I have eaten in. This was a second visit (the first was a quiet affair in a private room). The service was friendly and quick, the food superb - we tried a ravioli dish and a vegetarian pasta with truffle - the latter was not in the menu, but suggested to us. My suggestion: do ask for it. The one drawback was the noise from other tables (despite the reasonable distance) - maybe our bad luck; could be a problem with the acoustics. But go for the food
5
Every time I go there, it does not fail me. From the entrance to the seating, appetiser to coffee, lunch service is amazing.The food is well presented, delicious and value for money The service staff perform their jobs with passion and pride. Bread spread, freshly baked, is fantastic.Enjoy my meals there and would visit again
4
Great place for business lunch or dinner. Professional attendant, food beautifully executed.Food: 9/10Almost perfect. Except for their tenderloin, not really the top of the class.Value: 6-8/10Lunch menu is reasonable. Dinner set meal is over the top, many other better choice out there at this price point Service: 7/10Most of them are professional and friendly. Particularly upset with the unprofessional working of a short and stout waiter. Wine: 8/10Great wine though bit pricey. A double magnum at $900+.. Ambience: 9/10Many private rooms. Good for business discussion
4
Lovely looking venue , quite plush and business feeling , a few ladies who lunch. Food choice and quality is magnificent! Even set menu is very amenable! Wine choice is very good but careful as can cut your wallet in half !!!Service very friendly and efficient. Maybe a bit more chilled in the evening but definitely high end 
4
Otto Ristorante and Otto Locanda have now merged and the surviving restaurant is Otto at Maxwell Court.Otto has both a set menu and an ala carte at lunch. I normally have the set but today we decided on the ala carte. We shared a burratta with ham and tomatoes. The burratta was fresh and creamy. Otto had a black truffle festival underway - a couple of us tried that menu with a truffle risotto and linguini. The others had grilled fish. The risotto and linguini were excellent while the fish was average. Service has become more efficient which s goodPrices seem to have moved up in their new menu.
5
I've been going back to Otto for their annually white Truffle seasonal menu since 3 years ago when my cousin introduced me to this restaurant. The reception is very hospitable and friendly. I love the new decor which exudes a very warm and comfortable vibes. I love the scallop with white truffle and the must have pasta with white truffle. I'm going back again this year, thumbs up
5
We tried the degustation menu. 5 courses for 98sgd.
Every courses was very delicious, tasty and well presented.
Among those, the beef was spectacular.
Service is very good too.
Have tried many Italians in Singapore, Otto is a clear favorite of us!
5
We loved the food over here so much; very honest and simple good Italian food. We loved the starters (monkfish carpaccio - traditional carpaccio, ...) and afterwards we had 4 different types of past and all were truly excellent. The choice of wines is great (not always cheap - typical Italian). And last but not least, service was good. We'd love to come back. Thanks
5
My husband birthday dinner yesterday night was a success from the beginning until the end.What can I say except that our dinner in OTTO restaurant reached all our expectations: first the decoration and ambiance is cozy, spacious and stylish. The waiter gave us a nice and large table in the round main room.The staff is very professional, kind and helpful when asking for some details of the dishes.We have been offered a complementary amuse-bouche, a puff choux with smoked salmon, tasty and light.Then we ordered a la carte: the soup of the day, which was a zucchini soup, and the veal ravioli with sage and truffles.For the mains, I had the fennel halibut with cauliflower mash and my husband the cod wrapped in Parma ham with spinach and langoustine sauce. And for dessert the vanilla crème brulee and the tiramisu. Also, as they know it was a special occasion, the butler offered a complementary hazelnut and chocolate cake with a candle on top. Very much appreciated!The food was really delicious, with real flavors from Italy, not so easy to find in Singapore.Don’t miss the homemade bread and a cup of Prosecco to complete the dinner.Thanks to all the team for the nice evening we spent with you.And see you soon
5
I usually refrain from Italian restaurants out of Italy in that they tend to mimic the stereotypes on the country, sacrificing quality to "colore". So many Italian restaurants, even upmarket and even in very international cities as London, would be too loud and picturesque and simply would not be acceptable to a demanding Italian customer.Otto is a totally different story: elegant, discreet, and offering high standard, though very courteous and welcoming, service, and on top of this excellent raw materials and preparation. Wine list is good and competently illustrated to customers.Briefly, it could honourably compete with upmarket restaurants in Mila
5
Otto Ristorante moved to it's current location from 2015 but the food they serve remains exquisite. The service is excellent but go easy on the Italian liquor at the end of the meal. We were placed in a private dining room and the decor is modern and well lit. All the food is well seasoned, cooked and presented. Reservation is required. 32 Maxwell Road, #01-02/03 Maxwell Chamber
5
Our first visit to OTTO was one year earlier on our previous visit to Singapore. We were welcomed back like regulars. This time the restaurant was in its new premises. Stunningly designed so that nobody was too close to anybody else. Spacious, yet with privacy, together with warmth from decor and design.Food was as yummy as ever. What to choose? Wonderful menuWine list superbStaff are attentive and helpfulWe rolled out of the restaurant having vastly over eate
3
Came here for dinner with colleagues and I honestly cannot understand what the hype was about. We love Italian food and frequently travel to Italy for work, and have sampled many other Italian restaurants where the food pricing, quality, and execution were much better than what we had at Otto. The uni pasta was overly heavy with barely enough acidity to balance the dish, and the other dishes that we had that night were really forgettable. Imagine the shock when we saw our bill and realised that this place delivered decent food, but at a price tag higher than places like Da lucca and Burlamacco. Wasn't impressed
5
Good business ambience as it is right next to Maxwell Chamber - where all the arbitration matters are heard. Convenient for people working in the Tanjong Pagar district. We have been here on a few occasions.Main courses are ample for lunch portion-wise. The lunch degustation menu is a good option with not too large portions for each dish. Price is on the high side but definitely what you would expect to pay for a high end and good quality Italian Restaurant. Sommelier Paolo was also helpful. Pretty extensive selection of wines
5
We have been regulars at this restaurant for many years, and this place has continued to evolve and become better and better over time.A must try is the starter of white asparagus with runny egg ... really superb.Their beef tenderloin for the main course was excellent.The restaurant also has an outdoor area if you wish to have a cigar and cognac afterwards, which was perfect for someone like me.Overall, excellent food and superb service
4
6 of us were celebrating our friend's birthday. It was a good choice. Firstly, the degustation dinner menu has the selection of delicious dishes such as tenderloin, beef carpaccio, soup and pasta. Good ambiance.In addition, the service was very good. The service staff, an Italian lady, was attentive and flexible. She changed some our dessert to deliciously sinful chocolate cake
5
Impeccable service, great atmosphere, excellent food and perfect wine recommendations. An evening of superlatives. Loved it.
5
Very beautiful restaurant, food was very good but what makes the difference is the service, a special thank you to Michele the floor manager who look after me and my friends during all dinner. We will be back soon
3
Over rated. Good food but service is not up to the level where it should be. Long waiting times between courses and a few hick ups make me think this restaurant lives on its pedigree. It was better before.
4
Pretty good place for business lunch in the central business district, for one-to-one discussions.
Not overly extravagant, correctly prepared food.
5
Went for our anniversary - superb restaurant - excellent reception, prompt seating and greeting for our anniversary ! Very good wait staff who appreciated our Bottle of wine ( yrs its BYOB on Tuesdays !) - the food was near flawless - the suckling pig with acacia honey and balsamic reduction was incredibly good and paired super well with our wine ( a Clos Du Val 1996) and the portions were perfect ( they even portioned it for sharing ) and not to heavy - my only comment would be add a cigar / calvados lounge for after dinner and warmer bread ( although the breads were great) - the desserts and the chef's complimentary anniversary cake was super touches. Of course we will go back not just for the great food but also especially for the service and BYOB !  Bellissimo !
5
It's been a while since I went to eat in a place where they would give you excellent food, excellent service, and quite good ambiance. The bill was as expected ($$$) but it was in a way reasonably priced. I've been to other expensive restaurants and they wouldn't impress me the way Otto did (wow factor)
4
Decent Italian food. I wasn't bowled over but I found the dishes tasty. The restaurant pitches itself at a fine dining level and the dishes are quite expensive. More of a place to bring business clients rather than family and friends. I think you can get better Italian food elsewhere in Singapore for lower prices. Good selection of wine. Staff were helpful and obliging.
5
I wasn't that keen when a friend suggested Otto for lunch. After all, if I want to eat Italian, Singapore probably isn't the first place that comes to mind! In any event, a change from the local food seemed like a decent idea after being on a non-stop eating tour. We were really tempted by the degustation menu but in the end, the lucnh special just seemed to good in terms of value of money. No one would ever describe Otto as cheap nor would you expect it to be but the lunch special really is a very good deal indeed.Overall, outstanding food, outstanding service, beautiful restaurant. What more can you ask for? I will definitely be returning at the next opportunity

I called a month before to book a nice table for a special occasion for me and my partner on our mid of December visit. I called 2 more times before our date to emphasize we got a very nice table in a quiet corner together.The restaurant looked great, the staff were friendly, the host was very welcoming. But the biggest drawback, the biggest expectation I wanted wasn't even the food, but the service. We were given a private table, but a private table for 2 in the middle of 2 large groups. So considering how loud those 2 groups were, I can assure you, me and my partner had a hard time conversing with one another.Everything around the restaurant was great. I loved the atmosphere, and the food was good. I had better Tenderloin, but I think the desserts were better.But to me, it's not the food that comes first. What I always want is service that cares about the perspective of their diners. I would never ever have to put a couple too near to a large group. NEVER. I understand the restaurant was busy and full, but sometimes priority of special occasions (Considering I called a total of 3 times to ensure we got a good table yet that expectation wasn't lived up to) is something service providers need to understand.Everything could have been great, but the seating arrangement ruined everything. It was such a special event for me and my partner but for this simple bit to screw everything up...it was really difficult to enjoy every moment in this restaurant.I want to remember my time with my partner, but I want to forget my time in Otto with her because it was such a huge letdown and worse, I looked like a fool because I was the one who planned this evening and my partner was excited to see what I could do for her. I'm not angry, but I'm sorely disappointed. I just can't trust putting any special evenings with Otto ever again. I chose Otto over another restaurant with superior service, I felt I made a big mistake.My suggestion to Otto, is learn to understand how your guests feel when you execute your decisions over anything you do in your restaurant. In this day and age, food doesn't cut it anymore. It's the experience, and the experience can only be enhanced by thoughtful service
5
Otto has moved out of the Red Dot Traffic Building to a newer , biger and MUCH nicer place. Decor is very nice with indoor and outdoor sitting and also 2 very nice private rooms for a more reserved dining experience. Food & service remain OUTSTANDING and they keep always the same standards that make them a reference in SIngapore not only for Italian food but also to any restaurant out there. Paolo with his team & Chef Michele remain on top of their game !!
5
Everything was perfect.
The surprise appetiser & complimentary meat tray sampling was a touch of class.
Highly recommended.
5
I went to Otto for lunch for a business meeting. We sat in the private room which gave that little extra privacy when you need it. Service was very professional, friendly and knowledgeable about the food. Will definitely come again.
4
This is the only place I'll go for truffle pasta. In my opinion they serve the best truffle pasta in Singapore. Other than that it's also a good ristorante for business or family lunch. Also a good place for dinner.
5
Restaurant is set as fine dining and serves Italian cuisine. Service is great and the staff will explain their menu patiently. Try the grilled Tomino cheese and their seasonal white asparagus.
5
Otto is the place where you would want to bring your best customer, your loved ones or recommend it to a friend without hesitation.It never disappointed me. Service is excellent and it represent the real Italian hospitality.Ambiance is a bit cold but Paolo and the rest of the staff will make you feel warm at heart :)Suggestion: let them recommend yo

Visited during my wife's birthday. Its our second time visiting during the white truffle season. The dining experience is fantastic with friendly and warm wait staff. This year's white truffle is so good with very strong aroma. The moment the chef started shaving the truffle we can smell the aroma almost instantly. We had the scallops, egg pasta and braised beef cheeks from the white truffle menu and a salt baked seabream. The food is fantastic. For the quality of food, ambience and service it is worth every dollar spent! A restaurant recommended for all occasions!

Friend invited me for dinner in new location of Otto. It's just around the corner of the RedDot location. We were treated as real stars: prosecco with free yoghurt salmon appetizer, cold cuts platter, linguine massala with fresh white truffle (!) and Australian Waygu medium rare w roasted potatoes and spinach as main course accompanied by a delicios Sicilian red. Closed an amazing nite out w a Grappa! Hmmmmmm !!!

So this place is a good lunch venue. The interior is slightly dark and the tables are close to each other not as close as some other restaurants but not for top-secret business items. The set menu is good value at $38. A la carte menu is a lot more expensive so if you order a la carte, you will end up paying double the price. Therefore, it is good that you need to like the choices on the set menu. Food is good. The burrata appetizer on the a la carte menu was a really good value because the burrata was very decent prize for $32. The uni pasta was nice and creamy. Otto is a very good safe place to bring business contacts and recommended. But I am not sure it there is something that will stand out as unforgettable

This is by far the best experience in Singapore : whether it is the food or the service. Otto can be a fit of a task to find, hidden in the Red Dot Museum. The restaurant is fine dining and serves Italian, in case wasn't evident from the name. This is one place we can never get enough of! While Otto would never figure on the many standard ‘Top Restaurant’ lists, it is a not to be missed , specially if you are looking for a special experience : whether it is to give your senses an over drive or celebrate a special occasion. The food is definitely amazing and the staff always makes you feel as if they know you : excellent customer service ( A rarity in Singapore!) with a personal touch adds that extra touch. A not to miss, is definitely the weekday set lunch which is a total value for money – a four course menu, which changes every week. The ala carte menu on the other hand can get a bit boring, as the dishes tend not to be changed very often. The pastas and the beef steak not to be missed.However always make sure to make a reservation in advance as the place always seems to be packed ( Probably too many regulars!). The place sure is expensive, but way better than many of the so called commercially publicized fine dining places in the city, where in you are often left wondering on the quality of the experienc

Had lunch with a group of colleagues recently at Otto and was expecting a good meal with the good reviews in Tripadvisor. However, i was left disappointed after the lunch. I mean the service was attentive and friendly, but the food was a disappointment. The spaghetti was slightly under-cooked and too firm to be the standard al dente. The dessert, the less mentioned the better. I did not expect a reputable restaurant to be serving sub-standard cakes that were too dry and rough
4
Great place to catch up with a group. Pasta - Best in town so far in terms of taste! Wine recommended was good as well. A little ex but worthwhile. Highly recommended.
5
I went heer with work colleagues. We had a 5 course meal, every dish was excellent especially the beef main course. I have been here before and have not been let down. Service was excellent and the price is not bad cionsidering the quality.
5
Visited Otto's several times both for business lunches and business dinners but also for social dinners.I love the place ! The food is always excellent but what really sets it apart is the extraordinarily attentive and helpful staff. The Manager, Paolo, is about as good as it gets - outstandingly attentive and courteous. Even the waitress - I most recently had a Eastern european waitress serving our table went out of her way to be solicitous. Despite the size of the place it has that kind of ambience you might expect from a family restaurant in Italy, where you get the sense the whole team work together well and actually want you to have a nice time and to come back. This restaurant has been around a long time and with its loyal and satisfied clientele deserves to thrive many more decades more !

I had heard so much about this restaurant that it was just a matter of time before I went there myself. I was more or less disappointed however. The risotto my friend ordered was not good and my ravioli was just soso. Portions were very small (we ate à la carte which should normally have bigger portions). The staff was rather pushy in trying to get us some appetizer as well, looking back it was maybe because they know portions are small. We didn't have enough to eat so we went for dessert as well. Tiramisu was really not good, such a shame, but the meringue my friend has was better. In the end, I had expected so much more of this place after having heard so many positive reviews. Price/quality is definitely overpriced/overrated. There are many better similar places in that same neighbourhood
5
After having tried many Italian restaurant in Singapore, we decided to try Otto, a classic restaurant of Singapore.And it was spectacular!!! The degustation menu has 5 dishes. Each of them is very different but they have one thing in common, they are very well prepared, with great ingredients and delicious. Whether it is the carpaccio or the beef, it is perfect. And the dishes we tried "a la carte" — buratta and veal ravioli - were also great. Superb experience and very well worth the money (plus it is very reasonable for Singapore fine dining). Bravo!
4
The Arugula salad was so tasty - the acidic dressing was balanced with the sweetness from the tomatoes and bitterness from the leaves... great antipasti. Loved the portion size of the homemade pasta stuffed with pumpkin, the sweetness of pumpkin was oozing out so gently. Took a bite of the seared scallop - was so beautifully done, juicy yet tender with great flavours. The soft ossobuco was so rich in flavours too! Only fault was everything was irresistible that we felt so stuffed at the en

We caught up with some expat friends who booked this restaurant. We really enjoyed the night, the food was great, the atmosphere excellent and the wait staff attentive.The professionalism of the staff was evident when I ordered the wine a 2011 however a 2012 was brought out. When I queried this, it was immediately whisked away and the sommelier bought out two new bottles of news both 2011 and offered at a slightly lower price but equal in quality to the original wine selected. All done without any fuss or fanfare
4
Celebrated a friend's birthday and it was a great location -- cozy interior with great wine and Italian cuisine. A couple of dishes on the menu were unfortunately unavailable but we had the lobster pasta, ravioli and codfish which were all excellent. They even brought out a cake for my friend which was a nice touch
4
Went here with some friends and a small child. It's not exactly a kid-proof place so I don't recommend it for families with young children. Good for dates, friends and business meals. Service was very good.Uni pasta was excellent but it must be eaten while hot.
5
I don't know why it took me so long to visit Otto - since Otto has been consistently voted as one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. So I had v high expectations tonight when we sat down to have dinner. And Otto did not disappoint - from the White asparagus to the pasta to the quail stuffed with foie gras - mmmmm. And the staff were lovely - special shout out to gorgeous Maya. Thank you for a lovely dining experience.
5
You can't find better Italian Food in Singapore. Fresh stuffs and properly cooked.
Bread and focaccia are excellent too (freshly baked) and the staff is really professional.
4
On my last night during a recent trip to Singapore, I booked a table at Otto, a old favourite Ristorante that has moved to upscale premises on Maxell Rd in the Red Dot Traffic Building from its smaller, more intimate abode a few years ago in the small streets of Chinatown.The service was impeccable, the Vesper suitably fragrant and chilled and the wine list extensive and not over the top on price.My amusing bouche was a delicious artichoke sampler.My main was a superb Linguini Boston lobster in spicy light tomato sauce - simply to die for.The dessert, well it could only be a take on the classic Tiramisu! Yum yum!Definitely worth another visit for classic, beautifully cooked Italian food in the heart of the steamy tropics
4
We attended a conference in Singapore and needed a break from the Chinese and Far eastern restaurants. Otto Ristorante Italian was a perfect choice to enjoy some Italian food. The restaurant located in a historical building in Singapore serves upscale Italian food. The presentation, food quality, and professional staff made it a perfect European evening in the middle of Singapore
5
Nice dinner... Great foodWent out of their way to help split plates and make sure all was good.We were late getting there but still quality and timing was nice. Remember ... Ask the staff what's good ... They know!!( personally I think all good... We shared 8 items and good wine section
5
2nd visit, this time for dinner and over two years later confirmed the quality of this restaurant. The first time was lunch where you get a great value set. Dinner is pricier although there are options for a degustration menu or ala carte. My choice of the assorted leaves salad with mixed grilled vegetables and arugula pasta with prawns didn't disappoint as they were delicious. Tried the ravioli of my friend's order and that was good too. So were the bread appetizer and the cake arranged for our birthday celebrants. A place to return to for a special treat
4
We came here with friends. The restaurant is a short walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT and there is also parking 2 blocks away. We made reservations a week in advance. Please note that this restaurant also has a sister restaurant named Otto Locanda. They are not the same restaurant. Service was excellent and this is a white tablecloth restaurant. The beef carpaccio was tasty but not anything out of the ordinary. The spaghetti with sea urchin was an unassuming dish with no visible uni but it was VERY umami. I enjoyed it slightly more than the uni tagliolini at Pidgin. My friend loved it. The veal ravioli was delicious. My partner asked for more bread to mop up the sauce. They had 4 varieties of bread: the foccacia was alright but the olive bread was very tasty. I had the suckling pig as a main and the portion is quite tiny. It also took a bit of time to cook (they warn you it takes 50 min) so there was a bit of lag in service but we had bottle of wine to help out. My partner had the tenderloin and the presentation is beautiful. It was served with mushrooms and was a good sized portion. Our friends had lobster linguine and said it was good. I didn't get to try it. We were too full for dessert. Overall, the winner here is definitely the pasta. I would go back for the spaghetti and ravioli any day
5
We go there any time me and my husband want to celebrate something special or if we want to treat someone nicely with an authentic Italian taste. I am Italian and live in Singapore since 1 and half year and to make a long story short this is the restaurant I would chose to go even if I was in Italy among the Italian restaurants of the same level that I know. Bravo Paolo (the manager) and Michele (the chef)!! Ci vediamo presto :

As tourists we were happy to have a rest for a night from everything that Singapore typically offer. Otto's Italian fare was outstanding, and it would have been easy to imagine that you were dining in Italy. A simply classy outcome in all respect, food service, ambience and, given what it offers, value for mone
5
Smallish but tastefully and stylishly furnished dining space, the intimate Otto has a modern, upscale feel. The top notch service was every bit as thorough and professional without being overbearing, a cut above many other places of the same calibre.The authentic Italian food was so good you’ll want to lick your plate clean and one of the better Italian places I’ve tried recently period. Complimentary bread is served upon arrival. Be sure to try the freshly baked warm, soft, moist and crumbly foccacia with onion. The herb crusted New Zealand lamb cutlet with red pepper passata is run-to-the-hills-singing-hallelujah-to-the-Almighty astonishing. It’s a simpler-than-usual treatment for the gorgeous meat but one that will make you wonder why everyone doesn’t do it this way. The Atlantic cod tagliata – “taggia”olives crust with sweet garlic is unassumingly satisfying. The magnificent hunk of grain fed beef tenderloin with bone marrow sauce and porchini mushroom is good, it is very, very good.The simple-but-elegant Otto is very much a special, date-night destination, where the art of classic, Italian fare is elevated. The staff are friendly and you are guaranteed to walk – or waddle – out satisfied. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.erfyi.wordpress.com

I just went today for lunch to the restaurant. I have been willing to go for quite some time and as we were celebrating Christmas lunch, we decided to go there. We ordered some starters which were good with the exception of the Burrata which was extremely bland. For an ungodly reason we had to wait another 45 minutes to receive the main courses. Mine was actually quite good (Filetto di manzo) and I enjoyed it. However, my girlfriend order lamb rack which was not fresh, as both smell and taste was funny. I mentioned the waiter and he said that he was going to investigate, but we did not received any further news from the “investigation”. Anyway, I feel that some stuff here is certainly good (not cheap thought), but in general I would say that is an average restaurant (at best).. It is not worth the expensive bill

The food quality is always good & consistent ...
The preparation is refined, good and never too large portion !
Good wine list & recommendation ..

Otto has been around the singapore food scene for years and its longevity is testimony to its consistently good food and service. I recently had the opportunity to try its lunch set and at $38 dollars, it's really good value for the standard of food it serves. Its ala carte menu is also available during lunch, and its spaghetti with bottarga and uni is a fantastic pasta dish that I never fail to order on my visits. Every strand of pasta is coated perfectly with the umami-packed sauce, while strips of courgettes bring a touch of lightness to the dish. It is clever and bold all at the same time. It is also great for special occasions as its interiors are sleek and romantic with dark hues and candles. Its service staff, capably led by their manager Paolo, are efficient and friendly without being obtrusive. Certainly worth a visit

This is a gem of a restaurant. It is trendy yet traditional. The decor is stylish. The logo clever. The tables are set far enough away for privacy, there is carpeting and banquettes to absorb the noise so you can hear yourself talk. The food and the wines are all sublime. Everything on the menu looked good, but sadly, we had to make choices. Every morsel we ate, was delicious. By far the best meal of our holiday. Paolo and his team are friendly and looked after us as if we were 'regulars'. I am pleased we are regular visitors to Singapore because I can't wait to eat at Otto next time!

We were introduced to this restuarant via friends, it is located in the old police station which has become a very nice F&B complex. Unfortunately we could not get a table inside (we tried to book by phone a few hrs earlier) which show the popularity of the restaurant. The outside dining is not as nice as inside but the service is fantastic. Most of us opted for the "menu degustazione" at SGD98++ which was delicious. The carpaccio was a very generous serving followed by other dishes such as "Livorno style" seafood soup, squid ink tagliolini (very nice) and either cod or tenderloin as main. The tenderloin portion was rather small for me being European and I told this to the chef Michelle when he came asking how the food was. I was pleasantly surprised when he came back with another portion of tenderloin for me which (at no charge) was as good as the 1st. Many European restaurants often have adapted their portions to Asian standard so i personally would not mind to have the option to get a bit more even payment a bit extra. My wife has the sea-urgin pasta which was a very nice dish and certainly recommendable if you choose not to opt for the special menu

The interior was a sleek touch of elegance combined with vintage charms. Our suspicions here that the service was excellant were affirmed the moment we were seated in the sophisticated restaurant, and it made the place almost homely, especially with the restaurant manager Paulo occasionally dropping by to check that everything was in order.Our shared appetizer arrived next, the Seared Foie Gras with Celeriac Puree and aged Balsamic Vinegar (SGD$29.00) - tender melt-in-your-mouth goodness with a buttery taste and hints of smokiness at its nearly-crispy seared sides.Then our Linguine Boston Lobster in spicy light tomato gravy (SGD$38.00) was served - large chunks of springy fresh lobster cooked in a delicious gravy that flirted well with the tongue. The pasta was a tad hard for *Charliez's liking, but I loved the harder doneness, so it was perfect for me. They helped us divide the portion into two tinier side plates (as shown in bottom photo).Next, we had the Atlantic Cod Tagliata (SGD$42.00) - in a "Taggia" olives crust with sweet garlic sauce. We rather liked the combination of a flakey crust coupled with the luscious flavor of the snow white flesh of the cod. The dish melted in the mouth like fairy food dust, its distinctive flavors lingering on the palate.For full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/10/dinner-at-otto-ristorante.htm

Hidden away in a converted traffic police building! (Which now hosts bars, restaurants and markets), the moment you enter the service is impeccable, clearly owned and managed by Italians who have trained their waiting staff to treat every guest like royalty. The menu is concise but eclectic, the food was just incredible, from the first complementary aperitif to the final complementary limoncello.
5
Want great food and service then dont waste time and go to OTTO. Paolo and his team give a master class of what great service in a restaurant should look like. Chef Michelle always has some great new surprises and his food is simply amazing with very high standards. A sure MUST GO !!!

We were lucky enough to be invited to a business dinner here recently, and we ate from a special menu in a private dining room. My wife rated it as one of the best 10 meals we've ever had, and it was certainly a fabulous dining experience, with wonderful food and great wine. Every course was excellent, but the squid ink tagliatelle with crab deserves a particular mention.I don't yet have lots of experience of Singapore restaurants, but this was superb - the food, the wine, the service, the ambiance - everything was spot on. And they even found us taxis quickly, during a huge downpour, on the F1 weekend - impressive...
5
I've been living between Sydney and Singapore in the last year or so and have had dinner at Ottos several times over that period. What to sayâ€¦... It's amongst the best Italian restaurants I have ever been to(anywhere) . Great food (try the suckling pig). Excellent wine list. But what shines out is a mixture of the style and sophistication of everyone you engage with. None of this is done in any condescending way. The people are warm and genuine. This is a class act.
5
I'd heard good things about this restaurant, so my husband took me last week and we weren't disappointed. We had drinks at the outside bar first, nice atmosphere and excellent service. We ordered two different tasting menus and the quality and flavours were outstanding. It was the perfect way for us to try lots of different seafood and meat options. Our waiter was very friendly and had a sense of humour a rarity in Singapore. They also had an extensive good quality wine list. The only thing I would say it's the decor is doesn't match the quality and warmth of the staff. I would recommend this restaurant for couples, friends and business colleagues without hesitation
3
Liked the ambience and service, however food could have been better. Had high expectations considering authenticity but was not satisfied.
Had Pesto Pasta and Tiramisu, wich was not so great
4
Otto is an all time favorite Italian in Singapore, offering traditional italian cuisine with constant quality of taste and personal greeting. I noticed that recently it gained in popularity among local Singaporeans as in the past it were more international customers.
5
Had dinner here with 5 friends, I must say the service was great, ambiance was great and the food was terrific. The wine list is expensive but there are a few value offerings. All in all very good and we will definitely be back
4
Chic Italian restaurant with very good pasta. Spaghetti with sea urchin and the linguine with Lobster and tomato sauce are delicious. the waggyu carpacio with funghi and parmesan is a perfect light starter. The beef sirloin was ok. Service is very profesional and efficient. They propose 5 different breads with good extra virgin olive oil. We finished with a good tiramisu.
5
Absolutely one of the best restaurants in Singapore--from the moment we booked to our escort to the taxi when we left three hours later. Fabulous service, delicious food, and a warm, friendly adult environment full of people having a wonderful time. I just can't rave about this restaurant highly enough. A good friend introduced us and we will be forever thankful. We were a group of three and ordered two starters (the Burratina was perfection itself), two pastas, and two mains (monk fish and sucking pig) to be shared amongst the three of us and everything was served perfectly--sometimes on a main platter, sometimes on three separate plates dependent on the dish. And the chef even came out to recommend we change one of our pasta courses for another pasta (not on the menu) because he thought it would be a nicer complement to the black truffle pasta…and he was right. We also left the wine choices to the restaurant manager Paolo, and couldn't have been more pleased with the two excellent bottles he recommended. What a dinner. I had to fight with myself to write this review because I don't want it to be discovered by too many people…
5
Had a lovely meal here with family and friends. Be sure to ask for anything that you may not see on the menu - they are willing to cater to your tastes in case there is something particular you would like to try. Service was impeccable
5
We consider ourselves quite fussy dinners when it comes to Italian. For this to be our favourite, there has to be something special, so what is it?Firstly the pasta. It's al dente. The choice of pasta is also well thought out. The service is exceptional. My husband is Italian and has travelled a lot and he thinks the food here is amongst the best he's had.I recommend the Burratina, the Foie Gras, the Truffle pasta and the suckling pig. If you like meringue, there's a great dessert for you here. Its on the 'special' side in terms of style and price, but for us, well worth it. Don't get confused with Ottto Locanta, which is just 100 metres away (and also ok); Otto Ristorante is in 'The Red Dot' building on Maxwell Road.Paolo, Michele and Angelo are wonderful hosts.Hope you like it as much as we do
4
Black decor - stylish but somewhat too somber. Be careful of small steps here and there. The food is carefully prepared and clearly much attention is paid to ensure a fine mix of flavors. The beluga caviar with condiments, white asparagus, tagliolini with lobster and beef tagliata with sea salt were delectable.Service was very good
5
I've been to Otto quite a few times - and it never fails to impress. The quality of attention paid by all the waiting staff as well as the attention of the chef to individual requirements and tastes never fails to impress. Being a vegetarian myself, they always find a way to keep my taste buds interested with new and sometimes off menu creations. Having entertained family and clients here as well, they surely know how to make one look good when hosting
4
Came back here again after a gap of almost a year to check out the set lunch. The restaurant remains a popular choice for lunch with almost every table occupied. Restricted choice menu for lunch but still a few tasty offerings. Service was reasonably efficient, although not as polished as I recall from my previous visit. Still represents good value for money in the vicinity
4
Very good service. Nice discussion for what wine is available by the glass. Staff are attentive during a busy time. Good value for the lunch menu. Food is very good. Atmosphere for lunch quite nice. A lot of business lunches going on. Will go back.
5
The food is good , the chef is very forthcoming with suggestions . The place is quiet for a quiet business lunch or dinner . Must try this restaurant .
5
I had a wonderful experience on my first visit to OTTO. It is a small beautiful restaurant, tastefully furnished and designed, amidst a handful of other establishments. Look out for an OTTO carpet at the entrance. Service was very thoughtful, although I could understand how some fellow reviewers may feel it a tad overwhelming. I took it all in good stride though. Food was also up to expectations, even as our veal ravioli came without its sauce. We managed to point it out, and tried the last pieces as what it was supposed to be and it was definitely made better. Being a night of celebration, this oversight was quickly forgotten. Wonderful experience acquired, and I look forward to dining in soon.
4
This spot was recommended and certainly did not disappoint for a corporate lunch. Comfortable dining room. But an odd waiter. Asked for orders minutes after we'd sat and when we clearly hadn't even opened the menus. Interrupted needlessly throughout the meal. Predictably, nowhere to be seen when I wanted the bill. Just a little out of kilter with the rest of the staff and the food. Two seafood pastas and a beautiful piece of cod satisfied us all. Monday lunch, keep it light, no wine, so didn't even look at the list. Most enjoyable, bar the waiter who just couldn't judge when not to interrupt a work lunch. But I will definitely go here again
4
We went to Otto for our wedding anniversary. We really enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the friendliness of the staff. My wife took the vegetarian degustation menu and she really liked it. Being Italian myself, I really enjoyed the food at Otto. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. We will come back
4
We went for my birthday to Otto last week. It was fantastic, though there are a few little areas for improvement. Service is impeccable. Waiter knew the menu and the owner also stopped by a few times to say hello and check all was good. We had a minestrone soup (ok but not super) and also a burrata starter (superb) - both portions more than adequate. My main course was spaghetti lobster - it was very good though some of the pieces of lobster were a little overdone - but the taste was fantastic. Again very good portion size. Finally dessert - possibly one of the best tiramisu I have ever had! We will be back soon 
5
On Saturday night I made a terrible error and went into an horrific joint at Clarke Quay (see my review of Octapas - I know, I know, the name is a giveaway). All is redeemed as tonight I dined at Otto's. Started with the "Filleto di Branzino Grigliato con Pesto ai Pomodori Secchi e Melanzane (European sea bass fillet with sun dried tomato pesto and eggplant) magnifico! Beautiful fish moist and flavorsome and cooked with great skill. Finished with "Crema Catalana al Rosmarino e Scorzette di Lime con Biscottino alla Noccioal". The biscottino were like heaven. Aided along by a coupe of pino grigios. Exquisite Italian food, attentive and charming service and a delightful relaxed but not casual mood. Singapore food at it's very best. Do go it's a lovely treat to eat so well and be looked after so kindly
3
It was a challenge looking for the restaurant.Although the waiter tried checking with us after each course whether everything was alright, it was done business like. There was no warmth, no sincerity. So it became a routine that when he asked, is everything ok? How's the food? Our answers will be ok, the food is good.We had white truffle with tagliatelle and found the sauce overpowering the white truffle. That was a disappointment
2
Last week two of us went for dinner, made a reservation and were seated in a less than desirable location. OK though as the room is more of a banquet hall. The service was rushed to say the least and rather condescending & probably the worst part of the meal. I must say the white truffle promotion is ridiculous! I ordered the risotto ($24) when served they put a weight scale on the table and shaved off 7 grams (the server then yelled the amount to someone) without my instruction adding $70 to the price of the dish, yes that is $94 for a serving of risotto(!). We spent over $400 for a dinner for 2 that was finished in just over an hour. Question always is would I go back..... ? (that was rhetorical
5
There are a lot of good Italian eateries in Singapore, but Otto is one of the best. Finding the entrance to the Red Dot building can be somewhat challenging as you have to come in from the side door. There's public parking out the back or in the URA centre.The food was exquisite. I opened with a very creamy broccoli soup and my companion had the rich tomato seafood soup. My main course was gnocchi with black truffles which was exquisitely done. My partner had the green risotto with smoked eel - and he praised it highly. We closed with competently executed coffee. The service was low key and discreet. It was a light and simple meal but very strong on flavours and textures, cooked perfectly
3
staff managed well to serve two course lunch over 50 mins (as per our request), interesting beet root carpaccio: tender and nicely presented. tasty, al dente tagliatelle, disappointing red wine by the glass, and espresso bitter like there is no tomorrow.
would I return: YES
5
Wonderful service and some of the best Italian cooking to be found anywhere. Don't let anyone tell you there's a better place for fine Italian dining in Singapore.
The sea urchin pasta is to die for.
4
We have being dinning here several times and they had been consistently great in term of food quality, menu and wine selections, service, ambience and value of money. The presentation, temperature, taste and creativity of their food are made by passionated people with pride and people who cares about what they do and how the customers feel. A good sign is, be if weekdays or weekends, the restaurant is always full. It is recommended that you make reservation in advance. Corkage is $40, but free if you ordered a bottle of wine. A full 3 course a la cart menu meal with wine is about S$100 per head inclusive GST and service fees. But the portion size is generous, so ladies or couple could share the starter or dessert - to watch our waistline. Foodies, give it a try
4
High level of service, imaginative and modern Italian. There is a range of set menus but we decided on a la carte - I had the "Linguine all’Astice dette in Busera" which was superb. Also the "Maialino da Latte Croccante Laccato al Miele d’Acacia e Balsamico Stravecchio" which was a little dry and not as crispy as I had anticipated but still very enjoyable. My partner had the "Tagliatelle al Ragout di Agnello con Sapore di Tartufo" which she raved about. Another member in our group had the "Tagliolini al Nero di Seppia con Granchio e Aspargi Verdi" and claimed it to be the best pasta dish he had ever had.The wine list is Italian and extensive and we enjoyed wonderful wines from Sardinia and Sicily. The wine prices are quite high but the list is good quality so choosing from the lower end can be done with confidence. The deserts were....Italian - hard to go wrong. Angelo was our waiter and he is very knowledgeable about the wine list and attentive even though it was a busy night
5
We brought two friends along, and this was our 2nd visit, and again we had a marvelous evening. Full house on a Tuesday night, nice lighting and atmosphere, and the service was as usual very good. We decided on the Degustation MenuWagyu beef carpaccio with mushroom and parmesan cheese saladLivorno style “Seafood soup” in light tomato brothHomemade tarragon tagliolini with live prawn and spicy Italian artichokesAtlantic cod tagliata, “Taggia” olives crust with sweet garlic sauceOrGrain fed beef tenderloin with bone marrow sauce and porcini mushroomRaspberry and Galliano pastry cream tart with orange light moussewhich were all very delicious and the right portion size, maybe apart from the dessert, the cream tart which to me was average.Dont forget that in the beginning of the week you are allowed to bring your own wine without corkage, which please check when you book. Above menu at $98 ++ without corkage is excellent value, and we will certainly go back again
2
730 reservation. Service started out well. Ordered some apps to share with our table of five. They were good. Then things went seriously downhill. It was 50 minutes between appetizers and second course. I checked on the second course at about 30 min and still it took 50 min. Then for main course, another long wait. When my rack of lamb came, it was barely above room temp. I mentioned that, and they got me another dish. But the replacement was also not hot. And most important, it wasn't great. It was bland. An afterthought preparation.Would I go back there when Singapore has so many good Italian restaurants? No, I wouldn't. Neither should you waste your time (or money). It's not cheap. For the money we spent, And what we got back in return, I would say this restaurant is mediocre. Take your well earned cash to any of the many other excellent restaurants in Singapore. You won't miss Otto
3
I had been to this restaurant on my Anniversary... I liked the Ambience but later on it became so noisy I felt as if I am sitting in a road side restaurant. We had ordered for a risotto because this was the only thing on the menu that was available for vegetarians. But the risotto was pathetic. It was no were close to Italian cuisine. So if you are vegetarian refrain from going to this restaurant. There are plenty of other options in Singapore which serve vegetarian food and have good ambience

Be it lunch or dinner, this is a delightful and cosy place within a 1920s heritage building that once housed the Traffic Police. It serves good Italian food and service has always been good. This time I had the lunch set with baked salmon with fennel salad as the main course! The bread they served as a starte is still the best cos they are freshly baked and warm! I like my choice of orange bread, not forgetting the Otto's sorbet. Worthwhile trying and definitely authentic

Ottos is a cosy and modern restaurant situated in the old traffic police headquarters near china townService is excellent. One on the owners is the "head waiter". Very friendly and professional. Knows everything about the food and wine - a rarity. He's very passionate about his restaurant which is reflected through out. The italian chef and part owner also made an appearance to enquire about our dinner. Nice touch.There are a wide variety of dishes to choose from. We had Parma Ham and tuna carpaccio to start. Steak, Atlantic cod and lobster pasta for main and a fruit tart and chocolate cake for dessert. All were excellent. You won't go wanting!Of course this quality comes at a price. Our meal was $420 for 3 including a $120 bottle of wine. One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Well definitely go back.

Been twice to this lovely Italian restaurant. The food and ambience is really good. However, my biggest compliment must go to the wonderful staffs at this restaurant. They are knowledgeable, patience and helpful on both my visits. I will definitely return to this restaurant again.

Nice place to bring business or date. If you want to impress. Obscenely overpriced wine list. Good menu. Excellent service.
Nice place to spend a Romantic evening or have a business meal.

You know when you go somewhere and within 5 minutes you can relax because you've picked a winner.......From a handshake and a warm welcome from Paolo to a delicious glass of Limoncello after the meal, this was an excellent experience. Our enthusiastic and highly knowledgeable sommelier directed us to some top quality wines at reasonable prices. We all chose the degustation or gourmet menus and the food was just sensational. A great ambience, very good service and interesting location mean that Otto's has become one of my new favourite restaurants in Singapore. Thanks for a brilliant night

I read reviews here and decided to go to OTTO. That was not good experience at all. Unfortunately, even huge portions was not cover flavorless and poor presentation of dishes. To begin with setting:very cold and simple not enough space on the table (but this is norm for Singapore). For a starter a wondered to have Capresse with buffalo mocarella, tomatoes, and fresh leaves of basil. But this ITALIAN restaurant even doesn't have basil! So instead serve me Capresse-I was given huge two pieces mocarella with pharma ham on the top and small cherry tomatoes on the side....what was that is still mystery for me.(Personally spend in Italy for 5 years-Ive never experienced something the same) I have honestly say that tomatoes and chess were very fresh and pleasured to eat(ham was so/so). But ordered wine Pinot Grigio remaind was disgusting, like it was bought in Chana town!!!The culmination was my main course: steamed garupa fish (this is nit Italian fish at all!!!) It was server simply by putting on deep plate with(as they sure) wine sauce. I try a bit and the taste was TOTALLY flavorless!!! I wondered to put some salt or black paper but it was not on the table!!!Overall it was my first experience in Italian cousin which disappointed me a lot. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for fine dining in beautiful dress but for those how get bored with traditional cousin in Singapore it is OKla

Dinner at Otto was an exceptional experience. Delicious food, great service. Everything we ordered was par excellent! Arugula salad had the freshest of flown in Italian cherry tomatoes. Had the cod wrapped in Parma ham which was perfectly cooked. Dessert was the warm chocolate cake with Haitian ice cream. Brilliant. Not too sweet and rich enough. Definitely a must-return place.
4
A detailed set lunch menu including lots of choice, each dish was well prepared and presented. There is also a la carte for lunch. A relaxed environment with professional service. The food is modern and fresh. I had the BBQ tuna which was cooked rare and served with BBQ eggplant. The fresh ham and potato salad served with reduced balsamic was excellent. The sorbet was crisp and with good citrus balance.I will be back for dinner next time. They have an extensive Italian wine list to explore
4
We have been to Otto several times and have always loved it. If you are trying it for the first time, it's worth going for the set lunch, which offers really good value. Our most recent visit was for dinner on a Saturday evening and while we enjoyed it, there were a couple of disappointments. The most significant was that the main courses for two of our party were lukewarm, not hot, when they arrived at the table. When we told the waiter, he apologised and took them away immediately with no fuss. They were replaced and we were not charged, which was a great response in terms of service, but it nevertheless meant that two of our party had to wait for their main course while watching the other two tucking in! Favourite dishes were the suckling pig and the pasta starters. The wine list is both extensive and expensive - a few more bottles in the sub 100 SGD range would be welcome
5
It was our firt visit to Otto Locando and we have been pleasantly surprised by this trattoria style restaurant. The menu offers dishes you would expect from an authentic Italian place.The positive surprise came with the greate taste of the food and the friendliness of Chef Mario, who spent quite some time chatting with his guests to ensure everyone has a great experience. We had Pasta with Buratta cheese, Vitello Tonnato, Sea Bass and Lobster and can recommend all dishes. The prices are reasonable for the quality of food offered. We'll come back

Cosy, comfortable and conveniently located, this restuarant provides a very plesant evening. The service is of the highest standard; very efficient and friendly without being intrusive. The food was very good and when the bill arrived we were amazed at the value for money. Somewhere we will definately be returning to
4
One of the best in town... quality food, atmosphere and service... you get the option to dine indoors or outdoor... love it!

Excellent food, special lobster salads was mind blowing
Great service and wine list,
Even I didn't check the final bill!

If you stay around south east asia for more than your stomach can bear, you start looking for something familiar, and italian cousine is mostly the next and best available. So we asked the concierge for a good italian, and Otto is a real good italian.We started cautiously and in no time we felt at home. The starters were classy, everything oh so tasty, and the wine was a bottle of magnificence at a very reasonable price. Service was legere but so friendly and prompt. For my usual closure, espresso and grappa, we had a bottle of grappa barrique served at our table, compliments of the house.We had a great taste in our minds and a great smile on our faces.Isn't that all we expect from a good restaurant 
5
Eating at Otto was an excellent idea and I would readily recommend it to others. It's a bit pricey but the quality of the food, the presentation, the taste, and the staff all make it worth it. My family and I had a very good experience with Otto and would definitely return. Portions aren't too large, so if you're looking for a heaping bowl of pasta I would suggest TGIFridays, or Chili's. If you want some creative, delicious Italian food, consider Otto as a good choice. We were there on a Saturday night and every table was taken
5
I think I've been here a couple of months ago, but I can still remember how nice their pasta kurobuta pork and tiramisu are. Their wines are great too. Top notch service! The ambiance and crowd is very classy and just right to have a perfect dinner
5
Having eaten here previously, I took my team for a celebratory lunch. Sadly, I had a bout of gastroenteritis but couldn't not be there. I'd like to say that the service team at Otto's were brilliant. Whilst my colleagues were ordering from the set lunch, I asked if it was possible to have a simple bowl of boiled pasta with a sprinkling of parmesan. Nothing was too much problem for them - they provided me with a perfect bowl of spaghetti and just enough parmesan to give it some flavour without it being over-whelming for my digestive system.My colleagues all thoroughly enjoyed their meal, including an Italian.We would go back again - we just wish it was slightly closer to our office
4
This is 1 of our fave Italian restaurants in Singapore. This visit we ordered from their White Alba Truffle menu. The starter of scrambled eggs with crabmeat & truffles were excellent. Equally outstanding were the 2 pasta dishes - tagliolini with white truffles, n pasta with kurobuta pork with white truffles. Even the special dessert of Sabayon with hazelnut gelato was good. You will not regret :)
5
Food is really good here. It is a truly Italian genuine cuisine outside Italy. The fact that the restaurant is in Asia does not add Asian- like tastes to their food, and this is of great value. the menu is extensive, with a la carte choices and degustazione menu as well as a set menu. The wine list is very large and very expensive (starting at S$98), and wine tastes good. The deserts are also light and fresh. The suckling pig is exquisite! And the seafood soup on tomato broth is also excellent. Waiters are very professional and kind.The restaurant has an outdoor area form those wanting to smoke (very rare in Singapore) and some outdoor dining. However the cozy atmosphere is indoor. The restaurant is inside the Red Dot Design Museum which makes it handy for a museum tour followed by dinner. It is small place so you need to secure booking in advance, and closed on Sundays!A great experience, a bit pricy (expect S$100 per person without drinks) but really really worthy for that special occasion
4
In my opinion the best Italian Restaurant in Singapore. I go there quite regularly when travelling through Singapore and I've never been wrong.It is not cheap but I believe it's worth the money. Beside a number of traditional and "common" dishes there are very particular receipts well prepared by the Italian Chef. The wine list is of a very good level but aside the usual expensive bottles it is possible to find some more affordable wine with very good value for money.No doubt it is a place I would recommend to anybody
5
Five of us ate at the Otto on Tuesday for a business lunch. Everything about the place was 'just right' from the welcome smile through to the service and food. Three of us had the three course set menu ($32++) whilst the others went a la carte. All the food was well cooked and very tasty (I don't think that there was anything left on any of the plates!).I was so impressed, that I will be returning later this month for a team lunch for 8 people, including with an Italian
5
This is a top restaurant in Singapore, the food is consistently excellent and the service friendly and efficient. On this visit I had the homemade squid ink taglioni with seafood sabayon which was quite delicious and perfectly seasoned. Will be back again soon.
4
Apart from the slightly dark and dull entrance round the corner of a dark-ish alfresco bar area, the service and food are consistently good. The pork belly is melt in your mouth with a crisp exterior. Fairly extensive wine list and it's our go to restaurant for our personal guests and clients alike. Although its interior is contemporary and in shades of grey, I like that it's simple but yet cosy as it's not a large restaurant. There is a round table if you prefer to seat your guests that way
4
I'm Italian, so I guess a knew a thing or two about Italian food and restaurants: well, I honestly believe that Otto is one of the best Italian restaurant you can find outside Italy. Probably the look and atmosphere is not so "classic Italian", but once the food is served you have no doubts about what you're eating: either it's a pasta or a second course, or even a dessert, everything tastes good and, more important, genuine. I've had a few words with the owner and he confirmed every ingredient comes from Italy. Of course, price is not exactly low, but still quite acceptable considered the quality of food
3
Otto means 'Eight' in Italian. But it's more like a six out of ten.The entrance is unflattering and you could walk past it without noticing. The dining area is small and resembles a dining room at home - so not much privacy. The food is average Italian fare and there were no truffles when we were there. Plus point for waiving corkage for us.Behind Gaia & Oso in the pecking order.No rush to go back
5
Whenever I am in Singapore for business, I make sure I book a meal at Otto's. Clients like it and every time they thank me for making them discover this new place.Staff are friendly and efficient, the setting small but cozy. It's not that straight forward to find the entrance, and not the best for getting a taxi once the meal is over, however it's a very small inconvenience if any at all.The set lunch menu is great value for money, and you get to sample some great dishes. Every time I've been there the chef has come up with something interesting which I haven't had before. Italian cuisine has incredible variety and Otto seems to embrace it rather than serve the usual dishes. In spite of being Italian, many times I've been served something I never tried before.Going back in a few weeks and definitely Otto is on my to do list

There are now many excellent restaurants in Singapore. Otto is one of them . Located in the business area , close to Maxwell Road , it is conveniently located and serves excellent italian food and wines . I invited an ambassador there and we had a wonderful lunch . One thing you should try in any of these italian restaurants in Singapore : the burrata . it is better than anywhere else 
4
The staff was friendly and spoke with a heavy Italian accent which really added to the atmosphere. The menu was interesting in that it was not a huge selection but had creative pasta and meat dishes. Worth a visit if you are in the business district
5
It had been sometime since i had eaten at Otto's, so long in fact that i had almost forgotten how good it was. This is a top quality restaurant, beautifully set into the Red Dot building on Maxwell Road, the staff are happy, polite and know their subject, the wine list is extensive and very expensive by my benchmarks (so ask for advice), the food howvere and is just superb. It was a lovely evening with three gorgeous women but i stole the show as i picked the restaurant......dont miss a visit her
2
Overpriced bland foodService was not up to standards expected and the restaurant was not fullLimited menuQuality of food can be destined as getting very near the sell by date. Salmon was certainly not fresh. Ministrone soup had never been near an Italian recipe and was a sample in an odd plate 6 spoons 2 lumps cauliflower and broccoli and a burnt croutonWill certainly not be bac

I was a bit worried when we arrived at Otto (with no reservation, and dressed incredibly scruffily in shorts and a t-shirt - well, it was a Wednesday night and this was a spur of the moment decision) but we weren't treated at all snootily, but instead swiftly guided to a table. Service was impeccably friendly throughout, although things were rather busy, so it took a little bit of time for our food to arrive.Food was absolutely terrific. Instead of making our usual mistake of gorging ourselves on the main course and having nothing for dessert, I had a very rich risotto (Otto has a good selection of vegetarian food, unlike many high-end restaurants) and my wife a bean soup, and then finished with a tiramisu and a creme brulee. The tiramisu had perhaps slightly more chocolate powder on the top than I was expecting, but the creme brulee was terrific - garnished with strawberries and flavoured with kaffir limes, which was unexpected and totally gorgeous. Would definitely return

A very enjoyable dinner with good friends. Great service, great food and great wine!

Delicious slow suckling pig and unusually good service for Singapore.
4
In ristorante Otto you will get real italian cuisine at (for Singapore levels) reasonable prices. Food as well as service was excellent. I will return for sure when next in Singapore. Grazie!
5
Ambiance, food, wine, service first class. The personal touches makes Otto special, from the advice on which entree will compliment your choice of main, to the waiter walking you out to the taxi after the meal. You will want to come back here as you know that the next place you go will most likely not live up to these standards
4
There is a bar "al freco"in the back end and a restaurant on the left side, once you enter a chic style entrance. You may be greeted by Italian butler(?) and taken to one of dining area which can fit 80 pax. The dinner course comes with choices of three different courses, which are 6 dish, or 5 dish or Vegetarian. Alternatively you may choose a la carte.I tried the 5 dish with beef. The side dish bread is something worth picking, though I warn you not to munch too much. This is certainly one of the nicest Italian in Singapore
4
Had lynch at Otto and dispite my many meals in Singapore this was a first in this Italia restaurant. It open in 2008 and after a slow beginning it become a very established venue for Italian food lovers. I had octopus salad as a starter and tagliatelle with meat sauce. Both excellent . Bravo Chef!
3
Otto is located at the Red Dot Traffic building and had been on my wish list for some time.Nice food but nothing really outstanding compared to a lot of Italian places in Singapore. Good bread service though with a guy walking a round with a tray of homebaked bread of which you can pick and choose a few times.Inside it is rather chilly so bring a scarf

My fiance and I went there for dinner, we order 1 gourmet menu ( S128), and from a la carte menu mushroom soup with white truffles, scramble egg with white truffles and spaghetti with sea urchinthe indoor sitting was nice and cozy, the service was very bad for classy restaurant,.the mushroom soup with foie gras was excellent, very nice combination with white truffles.from gourmet menu: tuna carpaccio was disgusting, it was tastelessthe foie gras with grilled pineapple and vincotto was just ok, i didn't like the combination foie gras with pineapple, i think foie gras goes very well with raspberry and walnut salad ( like in Gordon's Grill) homemade dutch veal ravioli with sage and truffle emulsion was very nice, crispy suckling pig was my favorite but it was only 2 small piecesi was very excited to try the spaghetti with sea urchin from a la carte menu, cause i thought it was very interesting combination and waiter told us it was one of the best dish, but when our dish finally arrived my fiance and i thought it was very bad, it tasted like really bad phad thai with spaghetti and sea urchin sauceour gourmet menu included famous warm chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, the chocolate cake was also disappointment it would be good for a cheap cheap cafe or starbucks, but not for a restaurant it was awful.u could tell it wasn't made with a good chocolate. we didn't finish eating any dish except the crispy suckling pig and mushroom soup, cause the rest was really bad the bill was SGD 350 but it was absolutely not worst it, if u want good italian restaurant i would recommend OSO ( the food,service,atmosphere is so much better) or Forlino for a nice restaurant and the food in Oso or Forlino its so much better u cant stop eating i

I wrote a review about one year ago, so I went back to see how it was. And it was still excellent. If you like Italian food, and you are in Singapore, you can't go wrong by selecting it. It is always full, so please book ahead. They had a menu based on mushrooms and truffle, the last one I don't like but my colleague had it and, also being Italian, commented that it was as fresh and savoury as it possibly can. It is very obvious by the quality of the mozzarella and the hams they have that they use the best suppliers, clearly by very fast air courier. The "Coppa" (a type of ham typical of the Parma region in Italy) was simply the best one I have ever eaten
5
Was there last night with 5. Service is plain outstanding. Welcomed,seated,watered by a friendly team. Owner came over quickly to welcome us. Funky building in what was ( I recall) the old Drivers Licence building. Now referred to as the Red Spot building. Excellent and good value wine list helped me consume 2 excellent dishes, each topped by freshly shaved white truffle. The scrambled eggs with crab, topped by truffle was heavenly. Soft eggs, generous chunks of crab....and the smell of truffle. Should have had a second plateful it was that good. Agnolotti was outstanding. 7 generous rounds, beautiful rich sauce topped with the truffle. Other guests had the Wagyu carpaccio ( rated highly) and the lady had the scaloppine which she thought the best she had eaten. Passed on desert and had a glass of grappa and excellent coffee. There are 2 grazing menus which looked interesting if a bit daunting. This place is so good, I am returning later this week.
