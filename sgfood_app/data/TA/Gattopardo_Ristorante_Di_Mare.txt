Classic Italian to be more specific Sicilian cuisine with lovely grill octopus, home Made pastas and the drinks to match like Italian wines Ripasso or Amarone
2
Starters, a pasta dish, mains and dessert - all of it average at best. Not worth the price when you consider the other options avaliable in SG.

Picture paints a thousand words, so here are five thousand words to describe the lunch - tasty!
Nice ambience but was noisy because of a boisterous table nearby.
3
Food is alright, not exceptional and certainly doesn’t feel like it’s worth the money you have to pay for it. A simple lunch for 3 can easily set you back by almost $300! The fact that you have to pay for water and each subsequent serving of bread just leaves a poor taste in the mouth. Desserts were a let down too, especially the Tiramisu

I first discovered this place in Dec 2017, and was excited to try their Uni Pasta ($38, which was very reasonably priced compared to the markup that most other restaurants have). It was superb. We also had the squid ink pasta with spanner crab, which was even more superb.Besides good food (the waiter informs me they specialise in Italian Seafood) there is excellent service and a wonderful ambience. Definitely worth celebrating a special occasion here!They serve their own bottled water (still or sparkling) for $3/pax free flow, which I felt was much more reasonable than many other Italian fine-dining restaurants that charge $7-$8 per bottle.Came back again in Jan 2018, and the service and ambience were still top notch. However, the best items were sold out so we were very disappointed. This time we had a prawn ravioli, which was excellent, and seafood gumbo-like dish which was average and their special of the day (prawn linguine) which was very salty and not very impressive.Including starters, dessert and a glass of wine, we paid $80-$100 per pax on both visits which I felt was reasonable. Both times we were served an amuse-bouche at the start of our meal. If you are going just for a pasta or a main, without starters, dessert or alcohol, it should be around $30-$40++.Will definitely be back, but will make sure I check the availability of my favourite dishes before I do. :
5
The uni pasta is out of this world! The scent alone is worth repeated visits, let alone the rich, umami taste. Definitely the wildest of any uni lover’s dreams! Texture wise the pasta is very delicate as it is handmade. Personally I like more al dente textures so I definitely want to try the dry pastas next time. Service was professional and efficient, but friendliness was a little lacking. The place is classy but pretty much everything upstairs says fine dining. Not the place I’ll visit for business lunch or gatherings. The ambience of the outdoor seating area feels a lot more welcoming!
3
Took my family of three for dinner for first time. Like the ambience upstairs and waiter and sommelier were attentive. My wife and I ordered the 4 course degustation menu and daughter ordered calamari and ravioli with white truffle. The ravioli was great and our degustation meal was good. But service was extremely slow. The interval between the first course and second course was like 30 to 45 min. Only dessert was served promptly.I would go back again, but only for lunch, when it's not crowded
3
Was there for dinner before and really enjoyed the food. The second time I went, I had the business lunch set, which was ok but did not wow me. Price is decent for the set but the overall experience is so so. Service staff is friendly but food did not deliver. .
5
Was there for lunch. Set in endlot unit at Trad St is a cozy little restaurant with 2 floors. Nice done chill place and looked very relaxing. Good ala carte menu and great lunch set at sgd32 per person 3 course. Very good balance in menu. Went for shrimp starter and linguini pasta with 3 cheese dessert. All dishes 5 stars! In the area it’s a must try! Highly recommend.
5
The restaurant occupies a double storey shophouse along Tras Street, in The Central Business District of Singapore.The overall ambience gives u a fine dining feel in a European setting. We were brought to the 2nd floor and was given a detailed introduction of the seasonal dishes that were available.We ordered some fresh oysters and Buratq cheese from the Menu. They used to pair Parma Ham with the Burata Cheese, but this is no longer in the menu.We ordered Tagliatelle with white truffle and Capellini with Red Prawns. The 2 main dishes were awesome. Chef replace Capellini with Tagliatelle for the 2nd dish.For desserts, we opted for the Semifreddo (Signature Nougat Parfait) and Torta Di Pistachio (Sicilian Pitachios and Cheese cake
4
Chef Lino Sauro is a talented Italian cook behind one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. The Octopus starter is a must. Good house wine. Few vegetarian options.
5
Traditional italian food
I went for lunch. Pasta are amazing. Like in Italy.
Dessert was delicious. Who could imagine that olive oil will enhance the flavour of a chocolate cream...
Would definitely come back with my husband!!
4
Good service as usual. Requested for butter but it is so hard that we can barely cut it. Fast to be seated n order taking, However the meal serving time is too long..
5
We went to the Darryl Martin and Lino brunch with friends who had never visited Gattopardo before. They loved it and we had a cosy afternoon and got great food. We loved the duck pastilla, the beef shin, the seafood zuppa (as always), the pastourma and the great oysters - and the other dishes too..... The wine pairing was great, especially the Prova sangiovese from Sam Scott in Adelaide.We will be back again soon.....
3
Went here tonight.Starters and main course very good.Service level in ground floor is terrible.Waiter always using phone to check his internet stuff...very bad behaviour...not acceptable for this kind of restaurant...seems Mc Donald level...please do something
5
Our party of 3 had a wonderful early evening dinner at Gattopardo. Our wine waiter Goedrius was superb, all our wines matched beautifully and fully completed the experience. We especially loved the Polipo (Octopus dish), and the Cannolo was divine. All in all a fantastic evening
5
First time there and I loved every dish - the burrata was beautiful with the fried bread and the wagyu beef was sublime. Only thing is that it was not specified that the 4 courses on the degustation menu was not up to our choice which should have been specified earlier.
5
Gattopardo is an intimate place for a lovely evening with fine food, lovely ambience and professional services. The restaurant is tucked away in the one way street at the city fringe; it has its own courtyard, bar, and southern Italy decor. One would feel relaxed coming inside this beautiful intimate complex.Downstairs is a dinning area in front of the open kitchen while my wife and I were seated upstairs, which includes a private dinning room.The food was authentic, seasonally fresh, and beautifully presented. On the night, we had the day's main special of blue lobster pasta with the lobster flown from France and the pasta hand made. The burrata and parma ham entree as well as the oysters were flavorsome to set the scene. The desserts were a treat to finish the evening the Italian way. Mineral or bubbly water was a fixed charge per person and then free flow for the evening; this was quite reasonable.We liked the professional service, polite and friendly, and chef Lino came out to greet and chat with almost every table for the extra personal touch. We had a lovely evening with all elements worked
3
We tried the winter truffle tasting menu at Gattopardo today for our 4th anniversary and 2nd wedding anniversary. The food was decent but not not outstanding enough for the price we paid, but we are both spoilt atas people who should have been Michelin inspectors instead of lawyers. We didn't feel the truffle was adequately used to complement the flavours of the various dishes, or that the truffle flavour was allowed to come through in some of the dishes. Our fish dish was way too salty, but they at least gave us a free dessert when we complained. We also didn't like the ambience too much - it was way too bright for what was supposed to be a romantic meal and the acoustics were such that everyone could hear our conversation. Service was good though.
4
Set in a corner shophouse unit, its location added to the experience of dining at an Italian restaurant. Was there for lunch but hoping to return for dinner just to get a feel of Gattopardo at night. The food is well plated with layers of flavours. The risone was a tad too undercooked, I felt, for it was hard and quite a chore to chew through a whole bowl of. Plus there was just too much contrast in terms of texture of the pasta with the octopus and bone marrow. Loved the signature dessert - the Semifreddo. Wonderful melding of the different ingredients.
5
I visited Gartopardo for a business lunch. Since I love seafood, I can say this restaurant can be named as the "ITALIAN SASHIMI" for the freshness of the fish delivered. Polite and not intrusive staff. Worth a visit! Well done, Gartoprdo!
4
The service was a little slow & uneven, and it felt like forever between the courses, but when the dishes came they were superb.
5
We didn't go with the degusation course and decided to go along with ala carte choices on their menu. Their staff are extremely patient and food was amazing!
4
We had the salt baked sea bass, which was very tender. We had 3 different pastas and all were delicious. Overall meal was expensive though - 4pax for $500!
5
Great food, beautifully presented. Staff were excellent and professional. We had the Lobster ravioli, chargrilled octopus and vegetable & barley soup - all were excellent.
The food also came rather quickly which was very impressive for this exquisite restaurant. will definitely come back.
5
It was a fabulous dinner, well planned degustation menu with a little of everything. Except for the pasta dish which was a little on the heavy side (oily), everything else was great. Service was attentive and though I believe that a degustation menu should be a little bit better explained
4
The restaurant was full but not too crowded ... just a little noisy with happy people celebrating the evening ... we had been before so we skipped the meats as we found the seafood much better ... the signature pasta with Uni and Caviar was most excellent as was the red prawn summer carpaccio we sampled.
4
Went there with a friend and it was good. Set menu business lunch with the choice and most of it was good. The staff is very helpful, but this is one of the few places not serving ice water. So watch it when you order water. Starter was very nice, so was the main, only the dessert was a bit dry but still good price/quality overall. Might be going back one evening and try the seating outdoors, just as you walk in. I think it might be good to go with some friends.
5
The Red Prawn Ravioli is a must try! Homemade pasta, crunchy prawn bits not mashed up ones, topped with a generous serving of Black Winter Truffle shavings. The seared scallops were excellent too as entrÃ©e. Even the bread was perfect I just had to ask for another slice though I was full already. Cannolo was the perfect dessert to wrap up the night. Service was excellent, the servers were friendly, attentive and capable of making good recommendations. The ambience was cosy with sufficient space between tables that gave everyone their own private space. A great place for first dates and special occasions!
5
We had dinner at Gattopardo on a Friday evening. The wine and food menus have something for everyone and the staff are very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly. Chef Lino Sauropod even leaves the kitchen and talks to the clients and is genuinely interested in feedback.We had the scallops for an entree, they were beautifully prepared with a wonderful sauce and cooked to perfection. This was followed by beautiful fish and steak dishes which were the best we have tried in Singapore. The wait staff recommended an Italian wine, it was very good and complimented our dinner. The service at this establishment is amazing - attentive but subtle and recommendations all spot on.Exceptional food, wine and service. The best we have found in many visits to Singapore
5
We had a group lunch in Gattopardo. We almost try more than 10 dishes and all were great. The staff are very nice and the Chef Lino was amazing.
5
Despite the place being full we felt that the service was managed really well, food was well paced, and we were even shown around the space to view their other dining areas.
5
Really taste of Italy !! Area is cozy and perfect
The Chef is awesome!!
Foods were the best !!! I
I have tried many restaurants and buffet in Singapore and after Long time I enjoy my food
Thank you Chef Lino!!
4
Had the set lunch and every item on it was excellent. The service is slow for a weekday lunch - so if you are in a hurry to get back to office, it might not be a good choice, but the food is fantastic
4
No wonder they were featured in Chope's winner list. Ravioli was superb and not to mentioned the Barramundi. Excellent advice on wine pairing. Will definitely revist
5
from the moment we stepped into the premises, till we left. the service staff greeted us immediately when we arrived although we were 5 mins early. she showed us to the dining on the second level. the restaurant is housed in a 2 storey shop house.. lovely decor with a private room as well. my friend and i ordered the set lunch (it's such a good deal). the items are so delicious. we had the vegetable and barley soup, salad (very good), penne (excellent), chicken breast (so so), orange sorbet (excellent) and cheese selection. loved their freshly baked bread. service staff are efficient. the staff who took our order was patient and knowledgeable in recommending us the items. the food came rather quickly, which was great. will definitely come back
4
Nice dinner nice food! I like the ambience and decoration most. Staff are friendly and helpful. The boss and the main chef came over to say hi in the middle of the meal. Quite a decent Italian who knows how to manage clients! Will definitely come again and refer the restaurant to friends
5
Came with my family (11 pax) for a birthday celebration on a public holiday. The decor of the restaurant is what stands out the most when we first arrived. Their selection of starters were plentiful and we ordered the burrata with cold cuts, polipo (Octopus) and the Squid as starters. All of us agreed that the starters were amazing. Same for the mains, we all ordered individually and had the baby potatoes and garden salad as sharing sides. Also, everyone of us thoroughly enjoyed our mains.Lastly. The service was really commendable. Throughout our dinner, the service staff were attentive and helpful. Will visit again!
5
This is the second time we are dining at Gattopardo, the first time being 6 years ago at its previous location. This time round was to re-visit memorable places in Singapore.The food and service is just as excellent now as it was then, and the location is better! We had the Burata to start, Seafood Stew with Rosemary Potatoes as a side, and Semifreddo for dessert.
5
We visited Gattopardo for dinner. From the beginning the service was absolutely amazing. The waitstaff were very knowledgeable about the menu and recommended many dishes to us. The ambience was lovely and the Sicilian style plates were a nice touch. For appetizers, burrata, scallops and the flavoursome octopus. Each entree was filled with unique flavours. For mains, I ordered the prawn ravioli, this was a stand out dish and the burrata and truffle sauce it came in was incredible. My partner order the wagyu tagliata, medium rare, which was cooked to perfection. Even though we were extremely full and satisfied, we made room for the semifreddo for dessert. The nougat flavour melted in your mouth.
3
We ordered Agnello, Zuppa, caprino e rafani, Millefoglie, Tiramisu and Tortelli. The zuppa was the best seafood soup that I have ever had. Agnello (Lamb rack) is a bit disappointing, it comes with 2 pieces, not tender and juicy, not so much meat there.
5
This is an excellent place to host your guest. The Chef is from MBS before and made excellent pasta.
For price wise it is justifiable for the delicious gourmet .
Will surely return again with my family.
5
We have visted Gattapardo many times and it is always fresh and delicious. The waitstaff is attentive and knowledgeable. The fish baked in salt is outstanding. We will visit again!
4
Attentive service staff & great ambience. The coconut butter that comes along with the bread was great. I love the dessert too...
5
Place is easy to find. Went on a Monday and the place is quiet which allows for good catch up sessions.
5
Gattopardo exemplifies Italian fine dining at its best.. each course surprised and delighted with its fusion of flavours. Portions perfect. Staff friendly, courteous and very efficient.
5
Good service and good food!
had a great time at the restaurant. the food also didn't take too long to be served- good for business lunches
5
Splendid lunch for which it's really an incredible meal. Super affordable and the calamari portions were huge. Fish is best.
3
I would actually like to rate Gattopardo 3.5 stars - if that was possible. It is a good restaurant (so better than 3 stars' "average", but below 4 stars' "very good"), offering high quality Sicilian food, mainly seafood. The restaurant is located in an attractive building on Tras Street. The dishes were very tasty. However, they come in small portions and are pricey. The fish prepared in salt crust comes without any sides - so you must order these separately if you wish to have something else than purely the fish. Service was correct at all times but rational - not as warm as e.g. at Etna or Senso. Overall a nice experience, but not our favourite restaurant for Italian fine dining in Singapore
5
I was left with the best of impressions from Gattopardo, and think it thoroughly deserves 5 stars. I enjoyed it much more than some of the restaurants in the top20 of tripadvisor for Singapore. The service was excellent. Staff was attentive -but not too much-, friendly, and knowledgeable. The chef, a Sicilian native, was also friendly and introduced himself to the patrons. The food was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. I recommend the degustation menu which was good value -- the 4 course option makes for a complete and filling dinner. It included a burrata with caponata and parma ham, an amazing ravioli dish (best ravioli I've ever had), the Spanish mackerel entree, and a semifreddo nougat dessert
5
Amazing meal. Ravioli with black truffle to die for. Excellent and attentive service. Best restaurant in Singapore.
4
Decent place with decent food, prices are a little more expensive but worth it. the location is central and the place is comfortable
4
We had the set lunch. Food quality was great and food portion was just about right. Very good value for money
4
Early evening dinner, had the tasting menu with wine. All courses were well presented, fresh and good to eat with sensible portion size. Staff very pleasant and competent.
5
We had an amazing meal in the private dining room upstairs. Everything from the food to the staff were excellent. The lobster ravioli was a particular favourite of mine. The selection of desserts were mouthwatering and I am not a big dessert person. This restaurant is well worth a visit
5
Visited this great restaurant recently with friends and had a wonderful meal. The staff were very attentive and guided us through the menu. The standout dishes were the wonderful ravioli with generous shavings of black truffle. While it has a seafood theme I was told by my wife to have the Wagyu beef and let me tell you it was great. A genuine charcoal flavour accompanied by wonderful corn. The deserts were terrific. Will definitely return
5
We had the pleasure of dining in this fine Italian/Sicilian restaurant. There were a group of us in the private dining room upstairs. We started with a selection of starters - highlight was the the chargrilled octopus followed by a seafood pasta with sea urchin. On to the main course - I would recommend the wagyu beef with chargrilled corn. Still more to come with a variety of desserts. Canoli was divine. Great wines accompanied the meal. Happy diners - all 12 of us. If you like Italian with class, try Gattopardo, you won't be disappointe
5
Amazing Sicilian dining experience. The food quality and service is 2 star Michelin standard at least. I thought I was back in Taormina with the decor and the quality of the food and wine. The chef and staff were excellent and the combination of flavours was sublime. There is an excellent Asian twist but a true Sicilian taste with Sicilian wine, Etna Rosso , need I say more. Oh yes, Make sure you try the Ravioli with truffles
2
Our first courses from the set lunch menu had to be sent back as they were stone cold in places.This is normally a sign of poor microwaving.All the food was average served by a waitress with attitude who refused to write down the order.The whole place felt complacent,couldn't care less and there was no atmosphere at all.It is not cheap for very mediocre food and is beaten by all the other Italian restaurants in its price range.Deeply unappealing
4
The resturant has both outdoor patio setting on the ground floor and air-conditioned formal sitting on the first floor, plus a private function room. Table setting is impeccable, with unostentatious but good flatware and drink-ware. I especially like the spaciouness between each table, the natural sunlight and cheerful staff. They are kind enough to take care of our planet and serve tap water, not just bottled water. The 3-course set lunch is $32++ real great value for money and I had the Tagliolini, pasta with sea urchin. We a glass of Ricasolli Chianti each and round up with freshly brewed great coffee. It is a real deal to enjoy such great ambience, service and great good in this lovely place. Must give it a try the next time you are near the corner
5
This was our second visit and it was just as good this time. We had one set lunch which is excellent value, starting off with the Red Peppercorn Cured Ham and Buffalo Mozzarella, which was excellent and nicely presented. This was followed with the Grilled Italian Sausage with Braised Onion, which was also a good choice. The desert of the day, which probably was the Cannolo, was a bit more average. My wife had the same main as the first visit: pasta with Japanese sea urchin which was a clear winner of the day. Good competent service, who adjusted the volume of the music, that was on the high side when we came. Highly recommended
4
Set lunches here are pretty good and value for money. Space wise, there are little corners where u can get more privacy especially on the first level if you have a big group.Service pleasant and no intrusive. I like such no fuss service where the servers obviously know their trade and doesn't bother the guests unnecessarily Gotta come back for dinner !
5
This was a group of 7 for business meeting we shared appetizers and main courses to try a little of everything. Incredible food I will definitely go back and the advice and the staff to me were over the top. A must Resturant to try weather visiting or your local. And great ambiance.
5
Went for a business lunch, they have a great selection (around 5 appetiser/5 mains & desserts) 3 courses at $32! Food was great and really good value! Recommend for a nice lunch in CBD!
5
I have visited this restuarant twice and the service and food were impeccable. The staff were helpful and friendly seeming to enjoy their job immensely. They even got a table for me the second visit athough we did not have a reservation with a pretty full house. Attentive service and excellent well cooked food made both visits memorable. this would be a place for a special date or occassion. Highly recommen
5
We booked well in advance for this restaurant as it was for my husbands 60th.We were also travelling from Australia for the week.We went to the restaurant on a Friday welcomed at the front door and taken to our table on the 1st floor we got a table looking over the street. The ambience was really nice.Got to,d about the specials.Ordered a shared entree then mains and dessert. Also we were given a complimentary taster at start and a sorbet before desert.We also got a special birthday dessert for my hubbyThe whole meal was Devine. Food was subperb staff Fantastic. Then chef came out and introduced himself to each table.Highly recommend this place for a special meal.We will return for sure on our next tri
2
The lasagna sheets were overcooked and tasted instant. The pesto pasta was a little bit strange, and the noodles tasted like buckwheat noodles bathed in Chinese peanut sauce; quite vile. Finally, the most blasphemous of them all, the carbonara was al dente, BUT had cream....Which was confusing since service was so slow, we figured they HAD to be prepping the food from scratch. See my photos: the plating was good, but the food wasn't impressive at all. We tried this with the Entertainer 1-for-1. Unfortunately, even with the discount, the food left much to be desired (which is rare for Entertainer).Other than that, service was impeccable, and desserts were good, if a little pricey.
5
It was my 2nd time having lunch at Gattopardo. . . couple of minutes walk from Tg Pagar MRT station. Lovely settings with great service. I strongly recommended their Zuppa (seafood stew) - very sweet soup and fresh seafood. Wayu beef is also a must select choice! It is Tender and flavorful, craving for more. (just a little dear... to dine there too often
4
I was impressed with the standout service from the staff of Gattopardo which shone particularly when they took the effort to come up with alternatives for one of our companions who is vegan. When the chef gave us complimentary petit fours of an egg pudding, our server very kindly told my friend that he would be sourcing for alternatives and would be back shortly. He came back with a delicious lime sorbet that my friend was very happy with. Aside from that the food was of course excellent (this wasn't my first time here) but the service made it a much more memorable experience.
4
not my first visit at Gattopardo. love the ambience and their lovely italian cusine, their famous seafood stew is superb, tried their ravioli with truffle which was gd too. meal was made more affordable with the entertainer app. will be back for sure
4
I had the business lunch this week. The lunch set at 32 SGD++ is very good value for money. At each course, at least 4 to 5 choice available. Excellent taste. Service was quite slow, a little bit too slow in my opinion
5
My third visit this year to the restaurant using entertainer. I love the pasta here - from ravioli to squid ink pasta with mussels to vongole to pasta with sea urchin etc. The pasta dishes are really authentic and the seafood served with the pasta is really fresh. Had the calamari under starters as well and it is really special with rice pasta, sauce and fried squid. The dessert served is just as amazing - ordered the dish with pear sauce,cheese and pistachio ice cream and the combination is just heavenly. The millefeuille is just as good. Overall always a lovely dinner at Gattopardo and would definitely come back for more. I have not tried the main courses so can't comment on them but the pasta has been one of the very good ones I have come across amongst the Italian restaurants in Singapore
4
My friend brought me here and though we didn't make a reservation, we got a nice seat on the 1st floor. The main dining room is upstairsOrdered a pasta to share and the tagliatelle with eggplant is very good. My main of barramundi is equally good, much better than the cod I had at burlomacco the night before, both are Italian restaurants . My friend's wagyu onglet is delicious tooOk service, though we had to pour our own wine a few times Friendly Italian head chef, not sure if he's also the ownerWill return
2
i am grateful to gattopardo for giving us a table at short notice. the exterior of the restaurant is beautiful and so is the inside where we sat downstairs—uncrowded, tastefully decorated. service too was good in that our server was attentive and pleasant. the dish i ordered was rubbish though—a seafood stew that should, from my understanding from the server, have had prawns and other seafood in it, and should've been like a cioppino or a bouillabaisse. in fact it was mostly a mush of dissolved fish, there were no prawns, there were token mussels and clams, and a few unidentifiable bits and bobs. i tried so very hard to plough through it but it was hopeless and i had to give up early on. another of our group ordered white truffle pasta and said it excellent. the third ordered a steak that she wanted medium-rare but it was all but dripping blood. we sent it back and when it returned it was reasonably cooked in patches and bloody in others by which point she (diner in our group) decided to grin and bear it. i complained about my stew though and it was clear that i had barely made a dent in it. but we were charged full price for it in what was the heftiest restaurant bill i've paid in months. dessert—forget the name but a cassata-like creation and supposedly a specialty of the chef—was edible but ordinary. gattopardo really needs to step up its game with the prices it charges. i ended the meal feeling like i'd been had
4
My second visit here. The food is good, tables have some privacy and service efficient. The broccoli salad was a bit disappointing- could have been more flavourful. The helping was large and could have been shared by two. We shared the salt baked fish as the main. The sea bass was well cooked and moist - although it could have been filleted better by the serving team.
4
Well i ate very well, the food was really good, everything perfect, but the prices are too hight in comparing, this is of course my opinion... but if you are looking for very nice food than you find the correct place... the only thing i didnt fing good was the salami, i was expecting something more tipical from italia..
4
The best thing about this charming place is people - staff was great, very welcoming and attentive. Service was quick and in the right order - appetizers have been served before the main course, unlike many other places in Singapore :) Chef came in person to chat with us and we found it extremely pleasant.Food was tasty / I took "Zuppa" which is their signature seafood stew - highly recommend to seafood admirers. My husband had lasagne and it was succulent.Prices are matching the expectations
4
First of all, I love their food. That is why I went there quite a few times. Favorite dishes include burrata (very amazing combination of ingredients, although the portion is a bit small), lamb-rack and the fish stew. I like how their seafood is all sustainably fished and their olive oil farmed in Sicily and brought back to SG by the owner of the restaurant. The ambience is pretty good too- modern yet cozy... They have a yard too, nice for a couple of drinks after dinner.However, quite to our disappointment, their service was below the mark for a genuinely good restaurant, especially some waitresses (even the manager-like lady) who seem cold and not very welcoming. Although, to be fair, some other staff are much warmer and more attentive...Overall, consistently great experience. Highly recommended!
4
The placed located at near by Tanjong Pagar MRT station, we are first time visit the place, the food was so prefect and the staffs so professional and friendly, actually we didn't make reservation but they said can let us dine in ..so lucky. The restaurant have up stairs and down stairs not many seat over there so if possible please make a reservation before you go. They serving lunch & dinner and mostly must have to make reservation especially lunch time period. They have fresh item to show to the guest and let's guest to see what's item and explain it to the guest, is very good. They have wine Sommelier will recommend wine when you needed always.
5
Had birthday celebration with couple of friends and the food was really excellent despite the small portions. We were able to bring our own wines due to the corkage free promotion on selected days. The chef came out to greet and asked about our experience after the dinner. One of my favorite restaurants I've been to this year
5
We were at the restaurant for a small group business dinner. The food, the service the ambiance is all impressive. The waiters and waitresses are all exceptional.
5
Quaint, relaxed, non-invasive and inviting venue for a business or private dinner. We had a pseudo degustation menu which was perfectly apportioned and tasteful with very nice attention to aesthetics...
5
While the amazingly flavorful, innovative food was the star of our evening, the welcoming, attentive staff , the special and unusual wine list, and the beautiful, relaxed atmosphere all contributed to an evening we will long remember!
5
Was celebrating the birthday of my Girlfriend there and we had an amazing seafood dinner experience ! Chef Lino was extremely skilled and polite , I strongly recommend this lovely Italian restaurant ! I felt home ! Buon appetito !
5
This is a very good and upscale Italian restaurant in town. The food is tasty, clean and the Italian chef Link elevate the flavour to a different level. I have to say his food is great. I have the ebi past and it was amazing, crispy small Japanese prawn with linguine al dente (Gnammy) . The pork also was really tasty. Great dinner Chef Lino
5
Went there for a celebratory dinner with the family and had a wonder dining experience.The food was excellent and the service very attentive. We were a party of nine and the sat us in a nice cozy corner downstairs.Some shout out dishes are as follows, Burrata, Polipo and Broccoli for starters. For the main, I had the Manzo (char grilled wagyu beef) and it was melt in your mouth tender.The Cassata that I had to finish off the meal had a special touch. (see photo)Great dining experience in a very very nice restaurant
5
Restaurant was located on Tras Street which is busy but once you step inside the restaurant was totally different and felt quaint indeed. Very calm and Italian feel. Had Parma ham appetiser with fritters and tasted refreshing. Ordered cod as main and seafood pasta for sharing and proved wonderfully cooked. Loved both dishes. Had popular cannola dessert - wafer with cream and pistachio ice cream - which was divine. All food were executed with perfection. Service was prompt and polite which I truly appreciate all times during meals. Highly recommended
4
Was there with some friends celebrating a birthday. Service was very good and food was excellent. We had a mixture of the best signature dishes the chef had and i have the say it was better than expected. The pasta is a must try at this place.Very extensive wine list to go with any of the food you are having

We celebrated our best mate's birthday here and had such an amazing dinner! We ordered, burrata & Parma ham for appetizer, shrimp ravioli with black truffles, squid & bone marrow pasta, seafood stew and fried risotto ball (names may not be accurate haha, can never pronounce/spell Italian dish names!) Every dish was done well. My fav was the burrata & Parma ham appetizer. It was such a delight! It came with bread fritters which was such a great pairing! The service was also great and warm. I'd definitely come back here again. It's great value if you use the entertainer app.

This is my first time here and the experience that we had blown us away. The sommelier was so helpful, and paired our food with a great Sicilian white wine. We only went for one glass each, because we couldn't finish the whole bottle. He opened a brand new bottle for us, offered us a tasting portion, and told us that if we didn't like it, we could return it and ask for another. But he knew his stuff! Not only did we like the wine - it was perfectly paired with our food.We went for the set lunch which I fully recommend. I totally love the crab meat linguine - perfectly moist, and 100% fresh crab. And it's not the fibrous crab meat we're talking about - it's chunks of beautiful meat. Wonderful to the palate!Highly recommend...The only downside for me was the pumpkin soup... but not because the soup was no good; it was because it was so filling that I was feeling full before the mains came. So if you have a big appetite, go for the soup

Had a birthday celebration there and we had such a great time. We were well looked after by the staff and the food is as good as always.
5
Great service n good food
Conveniently located in Tanjong Pagar.
Near MRT n good ambience. Will go again.
5
As usual, the service and quality of food here never fails. Our perennial favorites the burrata cheese, squid ink pasta and salt-baked sea bass maintains its high standards at every visit. Well done!
5
Our party ordered 2 set lunches (snapper) and 2 mains (beef onglet). The snapper was succulent and flavourful. The onglet was melt-in-the-mouth tender. Service was discreet but attentive; excellent as always. A+++
3
I ordered a seafood stew, which came with a very tasty broth base, unfortunately there was more fish than other seafood so it was more like a fish stew. The octopus starter was really good though!
5
My family and I were there on Friday, June 17 and received great reception from the service staff and Chef Lino personally arranged yet another extra-ordinary dinning experience for us. Keep it up !
5
A small, homely feel of a restaurant set in a conserved old shophouse. The food is very good; they come in good portioned sizes. We ordered the salt-baked snapper, beef steak, ravioli and seafood chowder soup - they were all nicely done and delicious. Sharing of dishes is a good way to get a taste of the variety of food. The staff were attentive and gave recommendations if undecided about the choices available. We will definitely visit again to savour other dishes. Oh, and the lady answering calls for reservations was really cheerful and friendly - the first step towards a great dining experience
5
Nice dining ambience. Very friendly and approachable serving staff. One of them (Ms Khat) even took time to explain the dishes to us before serving each of them. As it was our first visit to the restaurant, she recommended 2 delicious appetisers (Red Prawn Carpaccio and Chargrilled Octopus) for our family of 5 to share. We love the pasta dishes! The baked sea-salt snapper was heavenly and Ms Khat skilfully cut out the fish meat for each of us which we enjoyed thoroughly. The restaurant also provided a complimentary birthday dessert as we were celebrating our son's birthday! An excellent Sicilian meal indeed! Will surely return

The introduction of the Michelin guide in Singapore highlights once again the flaws of this dining guide. Singaporeans have an opinion about everything, so it comes as no surprise that a debate has started about which restaurants have deservedly been awarded a star and which not. This place did not, but it is well deserving of recognition. Excellent pasta, clean and authentic taste, fresh ingredients and attentive service. I can not fault it and give this place two thumbs up. Michelin guides are controversial ever since they branched out of France,so look for other sources of balanced and reliable information
5
I came early and they were all very helpful - showing me to a room as we wait. Food was also great. Appetizers were like tapas style so we shared a little of everything. For the mains, again we did the whole sharing thing because their fish baked in salt is for 2 pax as was their T-bone so we all shared. Portions were not as big as we thought but the food was excellent!
5
Great meal excellent food. Attentive friendly efficient staff.
Personalised service. Manager very helpful
4
The grilled octopus starter was splendid and the Iberico pork Jowl is worth the calories. We enjoyed ourselves! Service staff were exemplary.
5
The food was good and the chef was friendly. He personally recommended what to order and cook for us.
5
A wonderful dinner before leaving Singapore. The food was simply gorgeous and Italian Owner Lino (married to a Chilean lady) pampered us with some delicious starters. The Nero D'avola wine was outstanding, can not remember the vineyard but coming from same area as the beautiful ceramic plate setting. 10 our of 100. Tripadvisor followers you can not miss this Classic Place!!
5
Expectations were high for this fine dining restaurant. We tried the set lunch at only 32++ (usually those in cbd are mostly 39++) and were very satisfied by the overall quality. Definitely our best set lunch so far. Special mention for the tuna that was cooked perfectly. Service was good but can still be slightly improved. The only issue we had was regarding the complimentary bread... When our one was finished, the waiter came to withdraw the small plates and we had to ask and wait to get more, whereas other tables were refilled without asking, maybe because they were having a more expensive set... But all clients should be treated same :) Still, again, the set lunch is very good value
4
Attentive service in a homely setting. The food was satisfactory southern italian and the chef came out to acknowledge the diners at one point. Ordered the octopus appetiser to share, and for mains, the Barramundi in flavorful pistachio sauce, the squid ink spaghetti and the 'Risone' pasta with braised octopus and bone marrow. Out of the mains the Risone was the favorite
5
Came on a Saturday evening. Restaurant was not full. Ambience is very pleasant. Restaurant is tastefully done up but not too ostentatious. We had the octopus starter which was really nicely plated. The slightly caramelized taste was wonderful. The Caserecce was wonderfully tasty. Scampi was perfectly cooked. The seafood stew was a tad peppery but flavor was complex and extremely savory. Lastly service was excellent. Wait staff seemed genuinely friendly and gave great recommendations. It's not cheap but it's certainly not exorbitant. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant and visit again.
3
Went for lunch; 50 SGD corkage is expensive, especially given the place wasn't running very well. Cheese platter was unbalanced: the hard cheese outrageously salty, also too much salt on the greens that accompanied the piadina, fish for main not a lot of taste: sauce like straight out of the Barilla jar...The "capo" went to shake hands with some customers, but omitted some tables - how friendly is that ????would I come again: probably no
5
I was there for dinner on a busy Friday night. It is recommended to book if you go in a mid/large group as it runs close to full house. The food is awesome. But what is special is its Sicilian flair which makes it a very special, almost unique Italian restaurant. I find the Mediterranean blend of tastes to be extremely intriguing particularly if you like quality seafood, nuts and herbs. All ingredients are top quality difficult for me to chose. Their olive oil directly from Sicily countryside is amazing. It goes to show the attention to details. Staff are nice and attentive.
5
We were here for the Restaurant Week as we love Italian food and wanted to try out a new restaurant. The service staff was very attentive and took great measures to explain each dish that was served to us. The flavors in each dish really excite our palette and we enjoyed every bite. This is probably my best restaurant experience in Singapore. Highly recommend
5
Every dish was excellent! Will definitely be back for more! If only they can have the restaurant week dishes on their every day menu! More reasons to be back!
4
Everything was near perfect, just for the price of a glass of warm/cold tap water which costs $4.50 each.
3
food is good but nothing spectacular. nice food presentation. food was okay; just slightly shy of being memorable.
perhaps i didnt order the correct dishes; certainly forgettable experience.
the bread could hav been better and generous with its salt.
3
I am happy to pay this kind of price if only my portion is bigger especially the main course. To pay $44 for 3 small tiny pieces of fish fillet made me cry
5
This is one of the restaurants that never fails me!Everything was excellent, from the serving staff to the taste & display & quality of food, to the wine, etc.Chef Lino always made a personal welcome to his guests and this really made me feel very welcome!I entered the restaurant with a smile, but left with a even bigger smile
5
The flavours were bold, strong and bright and reminded me of the meals I had in Croatia, where seafood was fresh and strong with Italian influence. Between the two of us, we shared the stewed calamari with lemon oregano vinaigrette, the Caponata Tiepida con Burrata, a vegetarian eggplant pasta and the snapper. All were done beautifully and was a great perk me up in the middle of the day. Special mention to the olive oil (for dipping your bread) as it was one of the most fragrant olive oils I've had for a long time. Can't wait to go back again
4
Gattopardo offers a real taste of Sicily, between creativity and tradition.Very good sea food, they handle it very well, never overcooked.The pastas is a must , especially the bucatini.However it is not cheap,but this is the price to pay for quality ingredients.The service is very classy and friendly.We will be backfor more
5
My husband and baby daughter had a truly wonderful evening at Gattopardo! The service was excellent, with extremely friendly staff , who were very willing to accommodate us , despite not having a reservation on a Saturday night.But the true highlight of the night was definitely the food! The starter of burrata was one of the freshest I've had, but the crowning glory was the pasta dishes we ordered :) my husband had the restaurant special- seafood pasta and I ventured to try the Bucatini ( similarly to spaghetti ) with sardines, pine nuts , raisins and fennel. It to me was absolute perfect! For possibly the first time ever I finished my entire plate !( hubby was definitely surprised) . The sardines give the right amount of saltiness which is balanced out perfectly with the nuts and raisins! And the bucatini makes it light too. Highly recommended. I must say the seafood pasta was very flavoursome too and had a lot of seafood. It had just the right balance:)Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure must be delicious.The prices are definitely high , specially for the wine, but I guess Tras street is so hip and in that everything is quite inflated. However with such a lovely experience we will be back!
5
chef lino has a natural talent for handling seafood. we love his unique combinations that alway work - for example the sardines with puree of breadcrumbs and herbs or the hokkaido scallop with spicy pork and ankimo. The uni pasta is a must! So is the terracotta seafood stew, which is homemade goodness in a bowl.
5
The food is simply exquisite. Flavours are tastefully balanced with the good quality ingredients. Every dish is like an art, showing the creativity of the chef. Service staff are well trained and explains the dish to me. However there is a new staff who questions the customer's decision just to up sell expensive dish, dissuading me to order ala carte instead of festive menu which the chef specially designed. In the end, we requested him to not serve my table
4
Was really surprised on the portion of the chicken; potato tart underneath was good. Steak was well executed, though service staff did not ask how well done we wanted it to be. Friendly service staff with good service.
4
had the calamari & charred octopus as sharing appetisers, grilled wild snapper & char-grilled wagyu as mains & FOC tiramisu (anniversary) as dessert. de service was great & attentive
5
food was great , well prepared and tates great . had the calamari then crab pasta and Seabass which was perfect . not cheap as exoected but worth it as place was good and food was actually very very good
4
This restaurant came highly recommended by a family member. I was not disappointed. We shared four entrees between five of us, the oysters with caviar was lovely but nothing to rave about. I enjoyed the canadian scallops better. I thoroughly enjoyed the squid ink sphagetti with red scilian prawns, the main dish was just right though it was more entree size. The service was informative and a tad enthusiastic, but it came across as "pushy" and could have given the guests more time than trying to push the wine or the specials.....to a point we were looking for breathing space from the waiter! Overall, delightful but hold off the enthusiastic sales pitch
5
We were there last week to celebrate our anniversary. Had Chef Lino's degustation menu with wine pairing, also ordered the Normandy oysters. The whole experience was art, deliciously presented artwork! Chef and staff were all very friendly and helpful, very impressive & enthusiastic service is how I can describe it. Nice ambient to the restaurant which made us feel like staying on all night. It was slightly unfortunate that we were not able to get a table on the upper floor since there was a function taking place, hope to go back soon and get a nice cozy table upstairs
4
Our group had a wonderful afternoon on the second level, with lots of drinks, wonderful food and laughers in the small and intermit private room. The food temperature and timing was well arranged for such large group. Service was attentive and professional. The price with wine pairing was <$200 extremely reasonable. Menu: Prawn carpaccio, spaghetti with saffron, grilled Barramundi, roasted spatchcock, cheese cake and coffee. A venue highly recommended if your are planning for large ground gathering

When I tried to write a review and searched for the restaurant on Tripadvisor, I found two shops (two names) and they both belong to this shop. Both are accepting reviews, which is terrible for a community established on reputation and credit. Tried the dinner set, $250 for 2 pax. I would say the best dish out of 5 course was at most average, while the worst went way below the normal standard. The potato mash for the 22-hour-cooked rib was a bit cold; the flavour of olive oil is all I could taste for the grilled fish (I forgot the name); the dessert tasted like A supermarket house brand. The worst part is the service. There was a waiter on the second floor, who were not even properly dressed, acting like a street salesman. We ordered the set but he tried several times to push sell a dessert. He doesn't know what we ordered. We shared with him our feedback about one dish and hoped he could be the channel to convey the message to the chef, but he just kept talking back, saying chefs have different style and even asked me whether I have been to Italian restaurants before with a very sloppy gesture, which is very challenging and rude. Place was nicely decorated. But the food and service don't deserve the decoration and price. By the way, Amy the waitress was really nice and pleasant.
4
3 couples with 2 small kids. Had a nice table in a private section, almost like a private room.Among us we tried 4 mains and several starters. Food was good, the seafood stew was good, portions was large. The beef was perfectly cooked medium rare, though they don't ask for the doneness you want(my wife who ordered it doesn't eat beef medium rare).Staff was very attentive, overall a pleasurable experience.
5
I have been to many Italian places in Singapore. So far Gattopardo is my favourite choice when it comes to Italian Food. Food quality is always outstanding, very creative presentation of the dishes and unique recipes. Nice wine list. The restaurant is located in Tras Street with walking distance to Tanjong Pagar MRT station. Very good value for money
5
Of all the restaurants I've been in Singapore, this is by far one of the best. Located in a two-story bungalow on Tras Street, Gattopardo offers the best of Italian fine dining. We left the menu up to the chef's choosing and weren't disappointed. Each dish was beautifully presented and so flavorful. Excellent wine selection. Definitely a "what not to miss" when in Singapore
4
Overall a good evening. I would recommend it. The menu was a bit limited but it was well made up for with a very attentive waiter.
4
Delicious Italian cuisine in one of the coolest neighborhoods in Singapore. Mediterranean Sea bass baked in salt was fantastic. Great service and worth the price -- at least by Singapore standards.
5
To my mind this is the best restaurant in Singapore and the only Italian worth visiting in the whole island. Brilliant food, excellent wine choice and friendly and knowledgeable staff. Can't ask for more.
5
went there with a couple of friends for dinner.it was amazing from the moment we entered the coat yacht for an aperitif till we left(spoiled).very friendly and helpful service staff took care of us,and even the chef and owner MR. Lino came to our table to debone the sea-bass in salt crust.thank you lino and your amazing team for a unforgettable evening.well done gattopardo-team
5
We were 9 of us with business partner. The chef propose us a set discovery menu for the all table ... It was simply delicious ... The place is in a nice old style street in Singapore, the restaurant is quite ... Very good quality of products, prepared with a great know how and talent. 
1
Be careful, they overcharge you. Always go through the bill. Food is at best average and service is terrible, we made a mistake going. Don't do the same. Not sure what others were seeing in this place. Special shout out to Amy the server who goes out of the way to make life for customers terrible and should be fired
5
Had diner in this Sicilian restaurant . Great food and the chef is very friendly on top of being a great cook! his cooking is full of flavours and ingeniosity . We had a fish in rock salt crust that was marvellous. Starters are great too and I had a orange and red prawn salad to die for. Feel like going back to Sicily on holidays.Service is good and it is nice to see the chef working in his open kitchen.Bravo chef Lino
4
From the moment we were seated until the last scrumptious bite we loved this place. Grilled calamari and tuna tartare for starters were delicious and we enjoyed sharing (just 2 of us). Excellent recommendations from our knowledgeable server led us to try the branzino baked in salt. Moist and delicious. Finally a complimentary limoncello and dessert--gelato and some chocolatey treat from their menu. We did not have a pasta course, but I was excited to see they offer gluten free pasta. Only downside was the fish was served without any veg of any kind. I would have preferred to have some accompaniment and it would have perked up the plate. We will definitely visit again
5
Gattopardo is just amazing!I lived in Tras street for 5 month and absolutely it was the best restaurant where I was. Went almost every day and they treated me every day with the best food and wine ever.Great quality, great service, AMAZING chef!I take the chance to thank the team and Chef for how amazing, innovative and high quality they were with me for 5 months!
1
We came in a big group, but the restaurant was not busy at all. The service was still extremely bad throughout the night. The staff assigned to our table was not able to communicate very well in English and missed several of the drinks orders. It was one long wait from the minute we arrived until we left. Drinks came slow and the food even slower. The food is expensive, but not good at all. Portions are small and many of them were extremely salty. Several mains had to be returned (some more than one time), but never returned with a satisfactory result. Wine card is also very expensive and a lot of the wines were not even available. The few wines we found were only available in 1-2 bottles.. Can't recommend anyone to dine there
4
We really enjoyed the setting and atmosphere here.
Havent had Italian in a while andthough it wasnt the finest Ive ever had it was tasty and well presented.
We shared the calamari and mussels which were fresh and I loved the prawns which were zesty.
5
Have been there a could of times. Pasta is delicious, wine list has an interesting and good collection of wines from southern Italy, but best are the deserts.
4
Nice restaurant in central area, interesting dishes, friendly staff , chef and patron is from Sicily, seafood is the must here.
Quite expensive, portions too small.
4
Excellent and genuine Italian food in a fine environment. Good service. Fair value for money for this type of restaurant.
4
The place is pleasantly situated at the end of Tras St and the entrance reminds me of a quaint european restaurant setup. The menu is unique as it offers Sicilian dishes and focusing on seafood. What we love about this place is that the food is tip top fresh! We ordered the degustation menu and asked for a change in the soup. I was very surprised that it was changed to a higher price item. The array of dishes was delectable. This was the second time we came back
5
I came here for lunch last week and I had such a good meal that I recommended to a friend and he asked me to bring him here for dinner. I didn’t hesitate to say yes.It was a good thing I made reservations. The restaurant was full house for a Tuesday night!I ordered different items from my previous meal the one thing I had to order was the Polipo, which I have a very good recollection. We started the meal with an Aperitif, which was a glass of Prosecco.Here are the highlights of my meal:- Deep Fried Truffle Pasta: Tube pasta made inhouse, which was infused with truffle oil and deep fried. Served with halved tomatoes and drizzled with Japanese mayonnaise. Its good. - Fresh Irish Majestic Oyster: $9. Oyster were freshly shucked and served simply on a bed of ice and slice of lemon. It was fresh and went down to my tummy too quickly. - Capesanta Gratinata: $28. Broiled Hokkaido scallop with Porcini Sabayon and Crispy Sunchoke. This was served in half a scallop shell. It didn’t look wow. But when you scoop the first spoonful and place it in your mouth, it was ‘Wow. There was cut piecesof scallops at the bottom of the shell and it was covered with porcini mushroom puree. Its topped with crispy fried sunchoke chips. I absolutely loved this. Recommended!- Polipo: $29. Charred Octopus, Sicilian Olives, Sun dried Tomatoes and Celery Root. The octopus were lovely and I liked its taste and texture. The celery root was also good. Must-order!- Fregola con I Ricci di Mare: $38. Sardinian ‘Fregola’ with a Japanese Sea Urchin sauce. The pasta reminded me of barley. The pasta is cooked with crab meat and sea urchin sauce, and topped with a scoop of sea urchin. This was a richly flavoured dish. The portion is substantial. I would recommend ordering two different types of pasta so you can try chef’s other dishes. Good to have variety when dining!- Ippoglosso alle Erbe: $48. Fresh herb coated and broiled halibut fillet with fava beans, artichoke and snow peas. The fish was fresh and it was broiled prior to be served atop the various vegetables in a broth. A ‘light’ and healthy dish that followed the ‘heavier’ pasta, so it’s a good follow-up. It definitely filled us up, after this course. We ended the meal with a Almond Panna cotta with Mulberry Compote. The texture of the panna cotta was good and it was tasty. The mulberry compote sat atop the panna cotta, and complemented the panna cotta well. An excellent meal and the meal will remain in my list of great dining for some time. Highly recommended
5
When i stop by Singapore, my number one choice place is Gattopardo to entertain my client and it turned out to be a very very good time always. The menu is strongly consist of italian favour of fish and seafood and meat.The ambience was clean, modern, quiet and very well appointed, with excellent attentive service.MASTER Chef Lino's style of cooking is very contemporary, reflecting the flavours of the south of Italy in general and Sicilan style.They have nice italian wine also.I have good time with my client always !!!.Strongly recommend who to love food and wine and business
5
I have been to Gattopardo, back when they were at Fort Canning. They have since shifted to Tras Street and have been here for more than a year.  At their current restaurant, they have changed their menu focus to feature seafood across all parts of the menu, excluding the desserts, of course. This is unlike most Italian restaurants, which make Gattopardo stand out.  We sat on the ground floor, which afforded us a good view of the kitchen with the chefs preparing customers orders. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Deep Fried Truffle Pasta: The tube pasta were made inhouse. It’s infused with truffle oil and deep fried. Served with halved tomatoes and drizzled with Japanese mayonnaise. The deep fried pasta reminds me of crunchy pork crackling. Its perfect with the Japanese mayonnaise which lent a mildly sweet taste to the dish. - Bread Fritters with soft Burrata Cheese and Jabugo Ham: $26. The burrata cheese sits at the bottom of the plate and topped with Jabugo ham and bread fritter. The cheese is fresh and complemented the saltiness of the Jabugo ham. My first time trying Jabugo ham and it has a different texture to the usual Parma ham. Its of much better quality. Must-order! - Polipo: $29. This dish was octopus that has been marinated and then sous-vide. It is served julienned celery root with whole Sicilian olives and sun dried tomatoes. I loved the octopus which were tasty. The celery root was also good. High-recommended! - Crudo di Spigola, Colatura di Alici, Caviale: $34. Raw wild Seabass freshly prepared and tossed with imported Italian anchovy essence (much like fish sauce), served atop apple and beetroot ‘salad’ in a glass, and topped with Oscetra Caviar.  A very decadent dish, but I highly recommend you try it. The fish has a mild salty taste and its flavorful thanks to the anchovy essence. You mix all the items together and dig in. The jelly was also good, where you get to eat bits of apple which sits in beetroot jelly. The caviar lent a 5-star touch to the dish.  - Spaghetti al Nero e Gambero: $32. Fresh squid ink spaghetti with a mild spicy Nduja pork sausage. It’s served with Argentinian prawns and spring onions. I liked the pasta, which looks like soba noodles. The mild spicy sauce went well with the whole dish. The Argentinian prawn was cooked but it had a texture of sashimi prawns. It had a unique texture. Try it! - Dentice in Foglia di Vite: $44. Grilled Wild Snapper marinated and wrapped in Vine Leaves with Sicilian Caponata. A decent piece of snapper wrapped in vine leaves. The fish is nicely done and sat atop Italian vegetables stewed in a tomato sauce. The olive oil on the side is also flavoured which lent a nice touch to the dish. Its good. - Baba al Rhum e Sorbetto al Limone: Dessert to end the meal. This is a special that is not part of the regular menu. Rhum baba is like a mini round sponge cake cut in half like a burger and in between is a scoop of lemon sorbet. The rhum baba sits on a raspberry reduction, which give it a nice ‘tart’ flavour, with grounded pistachio. The lemon sorbet is refreshing.  I ended the meal with a freshly brewed double espresso.  The meal was good and my dining partner and I enjoyed the food we had. I think the restaurant has found a nice niche amongst the many Italian restaurants all over Singapore, and will do well.  Highly recommended

Gattopardo Ristorante Di Mare Tried it a week ago with a couple of colleagues, and we were blown away. This is exactly the sort of restaurant one would like in one’s own neighborhood. Immersed in tradition, very good food, a beautiful setting full of colour and art. Everything just right. It specializes in southern Italian cuisine and fresh seafood. The warm and inviting courtyard will leave you meditative on your last vacation in Italy. Its attractive Italian-inspired spiral staircase will leave you wondering. Service was thoughtful and the food does not fall short normal standards we highly recommend it
4
This was the choice of my business hosts, and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. The menu is strongly biased in favour of fish and seafood, with only one or two dishes that were not. The ambience was clean, modern, quiet and very well appointed, with excellent attentive service.Chef Lino's style of cooking is very contemporary, reflecting the flavours of the south of Italy in general and Sicily in particular. I had the Arancini (rice balls) as a starter, which were delicious, and then went for the Ippoglosso all Erbe (Halibut), which was light, delicate and beautifully cooked. My colleagues all opted for the Collare di Maiale Iberico e Carrubbo (Sous Vide pork collar), which apparently was really good. We all indulged in the classic Sicilian Canoli to finish. Delightful, delicious, definitely will return on my next visit to Singapor

Great lunch place.
Food was fabulous and Gerald is very nice and recommend a great choice of white wine for our lunch.
The private dining room was great and spacious and we had the piracy we needed.
Will come back again for fabulous Italian food.
4
Had eaten earlier at the Fort Canning location , glad to see the food is still great, but a bit pricy.
5
My wife and I first visited gattopardo in 2011 when they were still located in hotel fort canning. The experience was memorable.
Fast forward 4 years, we decided to celebrate our 5th year anniversary here again. No regrets!
Keep it up.
5
This is my 2nd visit to this fine restaurant. The food is superb, and the dishes we tried included squid ink pasta, Hokkaido scallops sashimi, seafood stew and clams soup. The dining room on 1st floor is elegant, and service impeccable. Highly recommended
5
I have not been to this sort of authentic Italian restaurants in SG so far and we appreciated having a quiet Sunday dinner there. We were happy to experience such a good typical south italian atmosphere and food&wines. Great, attentive, friendly service.
3
Atmosphere - 3/5 quiet but has potential. Food - 4/5 good quality food. Portions tiny and I have a small appetite.Alcohol - 3/5 limited beer choice. No draft beer. Happy hour price for Prosecco and Peroni ok.Service - 3/5 pleasant but when I asked for recommendations, the menu was recited to me.Price - 1/5 high. Very expensive pasta. Value for money - 2/5 or 3/5 much better.Still waiting for the bill! Got it now - above stands. Good but expensive. Much better value elsewhere

I recently took my daughter to celebrate her birthday at the restaurant as I have had good food and service when the restaurant was a Fort Canning.This time my experience was disappointing as the service was average. I had advise the restaurant when I made the reservation, it was my daughter's birthday could they prepare a cake and if they cannot I will bring one. Arriving at the restaurant, the Welcome service was fine and double checked on cake for my daughter and they said "arranged". On this occasion, I find the food standard has dropped and the portion was rather small for the price charged. Finally, when dinner was over, there was no cake presented and even when I asked for the bill still no cake. When I informed the guest services, all they said was sorry.My daughter and I came away saddened the quality of food standard has dropped and the service was poor and not attentive. I miss the old Gattopardo quality and service of foo
5
I've been in Singapore for a couple of days,i was walking close to chinatown so i decided to stop in here for dinner..i didnt expect to find an italian restaurant like this in here! The food was amazing, its not just a classic italian one, that's nouvelle cuisine!! Waiters are nice and funny, you can enjoy your meal at best!! The chef take his time for entertain customers and its funny to see him calls with a clap waiters when dishes are ready! And its cheap to be in here, that'a how a restaurant is supposed to be!
5
This restaurant is well worth the visit it's not too big and has heaps of atmosphere. The food is delicious and it has a great wine list. The package is completed with great service. The 4 of us shared 4 courses which was a great way to experience the delicious Sicilian flavours from the kitchen. Definitely will return to this restaurant
5
Impeccable service & well executed dishes. I've been for set lunches, but having a larger group today allowed us to order a variety from the Ala carte menu to share. The pasta dishes were done to perfection, & the seafood - grilled squid & the salt crusted baked fish were excellent. Enjoyed the lunch.  
4
A nice place for gathering and family outing. Excellent pasta and wine. Service is excellent too. Will definately go back!
5
Top food, impeccable service, great ambience. As an Italian I can say this is one of my favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore.
5
Good food, fantastic ambience, friendly staff! Highly recommended for date night/special anniversaries/birthdays.
5
I should stop by Gattopardo when I was business trip at Singapore. I invited my business partners there. My clients are all like their food and service . Also,they have good italian wine but,expensive.
I like owner chef's cusine.
4
Had a lunch with my friends. The set menu lunch was quite good and we thoroughly enjoy it. Also the price was quite reasonable. The deco and service were also good. However the A lar carte menu is quite expensive. Will come again.

Booked this restaurant from a recommendation by a friend living in SG. Was in SG for business with all parties coming from other parts of the world. AMAZING food, wines, service and ambience. Well done guys, will be heading back to you again.

I was there during my stay in such wonderful city ad I was amazed about to find some lovely typical Italian entries in the heart of Asia.The atmosphere were comfortable and smooth. Service was great and the staff very professional. Price was also an average compared with some others.It really deserve to be visited

I stopped by Gattopardo as another restaurant I wanted to visit was closed for lunch that day. I'd not been to this location before but remember the restaurant from its Fort Canning days. Chef Lino Sauro is a veteran & his beautifully put together menu & wine list shows this off beautifully. Chanterelle mushrooms were paired with tagliatelle for a starter & combined the freshly made pasta with the earthiness of the funghi. For the main, I chose the dover sole which was cooked with capers & lemon butter. The fish was freshness itself & was paired with sauteed spinach & a salad of heirloom & cherry tomatoes with raspberry vinaigrette. For afters it was a hazelnut crostada filled with pistachio cream & mulberries. The ambience & service was exceptional especially from my server Anthony & his crew. I would heartily recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience. There are good set lunch options but as I chose from the a la carte menu, it cost considerably more. I would definitely return to sample the other dishes

Italian like you have never tasted before: High end, flawless quality of ingredients, extraordinarily tasty and refined, yet very authentic dishes. Lots of fresh seafoodThe scallops hokkaiso, the tooth fish… The penne with truffled duck confit… divine.Not cheap but highly worth it Plus top caring, warm yet discreet and efficient staff

Currently my favourite pasta place in town. The absolute highlight and my personal signature is the truffle pasta with black Australian truffles. The Carbonara is also very special, a traditional style type from Sicilia and extremely nice. The wines are ok, fairly priced but nothing extraordinary to mention. Service is attentive and well educated about the food they serve

While galloping the streets of Tanjong Pagar alone, I stumbled upon this gem. Tucked away at the corner of Tras street, Gattopardo is a beautiful quaint restaurant for an afternoon breakfast. Sitting outside on a calm and cool afternoon, you can enjoy a book, company of a(singular) loved one(i don't really see this as "bring your kids in afternoon breakfast" place) or best, you can enjoy yourself. The food is indulging and tasteful - meticulously balanced spices and authentic to the core. I absolutely adore their staff for they are professional, warm, understanding and also because they gave me a complimentary fried pumpkin starter while my calamari was getting ready! :
5
My family & I have been visiting Gattopardo since the early days when Chef Lino started this Restaurant. Our young daughter would always be happy to dine at his Restaurant & we were always welcomed there with her. She says Chef Lino is her favourite Italian chef. Today, we have seen Chef evolve his Restaurant into a beautiful & cosy place. Also, Chef has become more creative & tasteful in his food presentations over time. He also regularly updates his menu presenting new dishes. When Chef Lino moved to a new location in Feb 2014, I have taken my daughter & her young friends to the Restaurant to dine. Each time, the kids have always been made to feel welcome & menu adjustments easily made for them. The kitchen staff & service staff manages families with children well (flexible).This is a Restaurant that my family visit on a regular basis: past, present & future

Decided to try this restaurant but left feeling disappointed. The quality of the food is ok but for the price you'd expect so much more. For 4 our bill was almost SGD 1,000 and we've had better for less than half the price. The room is well decorated and the service is reasonable. If you're tempted by the specials, be sure to ask the price as a few spears of white asparagus with a poached egg was SGD 50 with GST and service included. We won't be returning as there are so many better places in Singapore.

Enjoyed lunch for two and brought our own wine. There is no corkage on Monday and Tuesdays and a very fair 'one for one' corkage policy for the rest of the week - otherwise $50 per bottle. Pricey food but clearly of a high standard. Note as the name implies, seafood orientated. Seafood stew was good but a little mean on the prawns and heavier on the calamari (no mussels and only a few clams). Baked sea bass was outstanding but needs a side dish. Service very attentive and friendly, although we had no space between a shared burrata starter (outstanding) and the main course arriving. Lovely terrace area downstairs for an after dinner drink or post-lunch coffee. Overall a very positive experience
4
Came here recently to try the 3 course set lunch together with matching wine. Service was attentive, food was very good, and the wine matching very appropriate. Possible to be in and out within an hour if required. New location is much more convenient for those working in the CBD. Bill came to $160 SGD for 2 people in total including 3 glasses of wine each: quite good value

Some of you may recall my earlier review when this place was at fort canning. Well after a sizeable cooling period we decided to try again and this time with people from out of town.I have to say the experience was very good. All the problems of the past were not apparent, different people, different attitude and certainly proper service.We had 3 startes to share between 4, the mains were all different (i had the fish stew) which was excellent and 3 btls of good but mid priced wine.all in 4 of us for <$1000.they have two dining rooms on 2nd level and a small outdoor terrace (so you can smoke there), the slightly smaller dining room last night has a good feel/ atmosphere and I'm sure the larger one also. theres a private dining room down stairs - in the wine cellar, if you want is but its glass wall and near the restroom?. The outside bar area is pretty cool, relaxing and a good start to the dinner if your all arriving at different time.We had to book and the place was full - and on this performance i suspect it will be busy for quite some time. front of house guy was top class.ham on the bone is delicious - but we skipped that at $78!! special!! instead our shared starter of capaccio,misto and otocpus was stunning and very fresh.another special salt sea bass was definitely enough for 4 (the other table had that) and at $140 is great value - recall my other report on valentines $168 for a fish 2/3 the size.. Id say the food here in quality, quantity and taste is very good and yes - I'm definately recommending it and will undoubtedly go again.All in all a great dinner and my compliments to the chef and service staff
5
What a pleasant evening I had there. They have two tables at balcony overlooking the street. With a nice weather it can be very romantic.Service was fabulous. From the hostess to server, sommelier and chef. Chef made two rounds while we were having dinner to ensure each and everyone is enjoying. This is very important. I think it has more taste of Sicilian and even the wine list had fab ones from Sicily. Will I go back? Hell yeah!
5
My wife and I had dinner here last Friday night - at the bar counter I was very impressed with this place (and that doesn't happen easily) The restuarant manager Fabian runs an excellent front of house operation. Impeccable service and friendly staff (no mean achievement in Singapore) The food that we had was simple excellent....... the seafood soup/stew was jaw droppingly good and the salt baked fish I had was divine.If you are looking for cheap Italian food this is not the place but if you appreciate high quality and are prepared to pay then this is a great choice.Highly recommende
5
Although I'm not really into Italian cuisine, the food here is amazing. Everything that I and the group I was with tried was delicious. The portions are just right, and we left with our stomachs happily satisfied. The staff being super attentive, courteous and friendly, completed the experience. Definite recommend

Formerly located at the Fort Canning Hotel, Gattopardo’s new location will bring diners right into the heart of Tanjong Pagar with its historic charm and atmosphere. Gattopardo’s new move will be accompanied with a slight change to their old identity: the ‘Italian Grill and Pizza Bar’ tagline will be replaced with ‘Ristorante di Mare’, which translates to “Seafood Restaurant”. This new identity goes back to the roots of Chef Lino’s culinary style with dishes inspired by South Italian seafood
5
The restaurant staff were welcoming, the ambience was relaxing and the food was superb. We loved our dining experience at Gattopardo Italian Grill & Pizzabar.
5
Very good Italian Restaurant, fish preparation as typical Italian way very fresh Mediterranean and Adriatic fish availability also very large Italian wine selection simply very good
4
really nice place to eat at. Ambience scores a bit low perhaps because of the in-line seating or the hard floors which reflect too much noise. Cork or wood floors might help. Good selection of food and excellent preparation. Good selection of Italian wines. very good service and a beautiful bar counter for lonely people. (or couples). Fresh ingredients and good flavours, very authentic. On the night we were there, there was a local group of about 6 people who made enough noise for 60, so maybe that hurt a bit. Gary Danko restaurant in SFO has an interesting reservation policy. They dont allow reservations for more than 6 at any table. Maybe all restaurants should follow this. Frankly, any table larger than this is quite silly and any conversation generally degenerates into noise which spoils the fun for other diners. If there is a big group, forces them to break into 6s and make some real conversation. Might not work in Singapore

My husband surprised me with a visit here for brunch. It was outstanding! The service was spot on, very attentive and so professional. We felt so welcomed there. Each dish was prepared for our order. (Not sitting under heat lamp waiting.) The selections on the brunch menu were so wonderful! We added Prosecco to make our brunch over the edge. Everything was fresh, presented/platted beautifully, cooked to perfection. My husband has been there previously and expressed the same as I do. An outstanding restaurant for anyone looking for a classy, welcoming, extraordinary meal.Very true Italian cuisine
4
I went there with friends and we were pleasantly surprised by the dÃ©cor of the restaurant , I was out of this world, all of our dishes were simple, flavorful and authentic. A nice SMILES from the waitresses added up to the charm of the night:) Highly recommended for Italian food lovers
4
It was fantastic, the restaurant has a great atmosphere the staff were very attentive and the food was extremely good. We had linguine with Mussels which was superb and a fab chocolate mouse (which the kitchen produced fro my husbands birthday) which was gorgeous and not too rich! It is set in Fort Canning Hotel which is very chic and they have lovely terrace for a quick drink beforehand

I'm a regular and I love the pastas, bread and pizzas. And wine. But here's something I really hope management can improve on : The starters are way too expensive!! $30+ for most of them. More expensive than the pizza or the pasta or even the mains!! This is RIDICULOUS!! And this is so, even for the salads. There's only 1 salad at $18 and the rest of them are >$30. Most of the time, I end up going straight to the pasta or pizza. I don't feel like I'm getting value for money by ordering a starter thats more expensive than the main course. I feel ripped off. I've tried some of the starters previously, but I don't find them special enough to warrant that kind of price.Why can't management come up with half orders? I've asked the waiter but they told me the portions are already small to begin with (what??? for that kind of price??) so there's no half portions
5
We have dined here many times as it's our favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. It ticks all the boxes from ambience, service (from the moment the you call to book the table), food selection (their flexibility is great for us as we are vegetarian) & knowledgable, friendly staff.We love their pizzas
5
gattopardo in fort canning hotel is the place to be.fresh Sicilian food and i really want to highlight fresh ,since many products are imported from chef lino's home.a great variety of different dishes from pizza till a sea bass in salt crust.lino sauro the chef and owner knows what his guests want..also unique is their Sicilian wine selection which is part of there extensive wine list which is well taken care of sommelier Fabian.challenge him and ask for a wine pairing.we were spoiled by the team.really lovely restaurant.will be back soon

Fort Canning is an oasis within Singapore. Close to the Orchard area, on the top of a green hill in colonial surroundings. A cool evening and a nice table on the terrace are the ingredients for a perfect start. Fabien rescued his colleage (whom had no menu knowledge) and guided us professionally through the menu and made a few suggestions.We decided to go for 1 appetizer, 1 pasta and two main courses and split everything into two portions. The squid was nice and sufficient, the pasta and the two main courses were excellent in taste but very dissappointing in quantity which I would describe as "microscopic". The micro pasta portion with chanterelles Mushrooms was charged at 40SGD. Each of the fish portions were charged between 40 and 50SGD.The chocolate mouse tasted very well and was sufficient. The coffee was good.The check amounted to 210SGD (inclusive a bottle of water - no wine - no other drinks) and was discounted to 125SGD under the Amex Palate Program. We were happy to have discovered Fort Canning and Gattopardo and enjoyed the al fresco seating on a cool evening but after sharing 1 appetizer and finsishing 1 pasta and two main courses plus a dessert we left hungry and that should not be the case for 210SGD charge without wine
5
they have a magic selection of pizzas. The service was amazing. Overall the meal was good value in an ideal setting.
5
But don't want to eat Italian in Asia.
Having said that, I was tired and didn't feel like going out.
The tomatoes were lovely; turns out they fly them in from Italy, can you imagine? Turns out all the food is flown in from Italy.
4
We have dined here from its opening perhaps half a dozen times. Always consistent and becasue Chef Lino hailed from Scicily, he gives his dishes a homespun Sicilian style that differentiates them in the crowded Italian food scene in Singapore. In this visit, we had for lunch the grilled calamari, simply done in herbs and limone oil (A-), the Crudo plate is great for one person - one plum oyster, one prawn with some caviar and tuna tartare (B+). Then the two pasta were hearty and satisfying: a linguine in lemon oil and light tomato sauce with Bluefin tuna (rather than mussels per menu) (A-) and tagliatelli with summer black truffles (A). Sharing this with two lovely women over an intimate setting makes the business conversation so much easier to bear on a Friday. Thanks Lino
5
I have been regularly patronizing this restaurant since its inception, about 3 years ago, and I must say that both food and service have always been consistently top notch. The staff are attentive and knowledgeable about the food, which is very authentic Sicilian, with a modern touch.The specials - made with fresh fish from the Mediterranean, are a must try. If you want to eat great fish/seafood in an elegant and comfortable ambiance, this is the place to go
4
I tried the Salt Baked Fish and my son enjoyed their pizza. Both were great. They have a wide selection of seafood which seems very unique for an Italian cuisine. The Service was friendly and attentive at all times.The complementary cookies at the end of the meal were delicious.Thank you & we will be back

Went here today with our 16 month old daughter. We didn't want the $78 brunch so opted for the Al A Carte menu. We were expected to eat this on low tables in the bar area or place our daughter in a highchair at the bar where she'd only come up half way. When we asked if we could possibly have a table in the restaurant due to the issues with the highchair we were told only if we had the $78 brunch. When we said we would go elsewhere due to how unaccomdating they were the manager tried to give us a business card - like we'll be back
5
Chef Lino S never disappoints! We have a fantastic night at Gattopardo enjoying the gob-smacking food served up by Chef Lino. The staff were friendly and attentive to our needs, even answering the numerous questions we had for them. They also assisted us in pairing up various Sicilian wines with the dishes that we had ordered. To balance out the rich food that we had stuffed our tummys with, we ended the night with the Frutti e Sorbetti which was very refreshing. For those in our party who opted for tea/coffee, they enjoyed the accompaniment of lovely cookies to end the meal. Will definitely head back to Gattopardo again

My boyfriend and I attended a wedding at Hotel Fort Canning, and that's how we got to know about Gattopardo. The restaurant looked cosy and romantic, with the lovely terrace outside for those who wish to enjoy the warm sunshine. As we were looking at the menu, the friendly staff spoke to us and started introducing the Chef specialties to us. Intrigued by the interesting menu, and the friendliness of the staff, we decided to come back the next weekend to dine at Gattopardo!It was definitely a great decision. As it was a bright sunny day, we sat outside by the terrace and sipped on Sicilian white wine, whilst enjoying the lovely spread of food that we ordered as recommended by the staff. Being dessert lovers, I have to highlight the Cannoli Siciliani - it was fantastic! We also tried the chocolate threesome, and the Pistachio Tart. We had a lovely meal at Gattopardo, and we will definitely go back for more Sicilian delights

I was having a casual stroll with my girlfriend around fort canning after a movie at plaza singapura. decided to check out the hotel and looked around. When we entered, we noticed a pretty little restaurant just adjacent to the hotel lobby. I suggested checking the restaurant out and we ended up spending a couple of hours and dollars at the place!The interior was exquisite but we voted to sit outside as the view of Singapore's central and the terraced greenery of fort canning was too beautiful to miss out. My girlfriend was excited about the long list of seafood dishes that was available and we ordered the fresh seafood from the counter. The food was amazing. Super fresh seafood that was full of flavour! We entered not expecting much but we were blown away by the quality of the food and the excellent service. The food was a little pricey though, but it was well worth the money. We were informed of their Sunday brunch and we will definitely return to try that menu out sometime soon

I visited this restaurant on a Sunday on 10th March 2013 for lunch. Armed with my Amex Palate Card, I called to make my reservation after reviewing the terms and conditions of the Palate Card on the Palate website. I was informed that the restaurant was serving its Sunday Brunch which is not covered by the Palate promotions card, but I could still enjoy the Palate card privileges if I order from the ala carte menu and if I wouldn't mind to sit at the patio.I agreed. After an enjoyable lunch where I ordered two antipasti courses, one pasta and two mains plus two glasses of wine, I called for the bill. To my surprise, the management did not want to honor my Ames Palate Card. I paid for the bill which cost me SGD213.05 and I immediately called Amex to lodge a complain. Amex, did their dutiful job and I have to thank a guy called Martin on Amex who investigated the matter for a few weeks whilst I dutifully settled my Amex bills including the Gattopardo bill in full. In the midst of investigation, Gattopardo unilateraly changed the T&C on the palate website, not claiming that it does not serve ala carte on Sundays. Luckily I still held onto my receipt else I would have been accused of being a cheater instead of the management of the restaurant. Their argument of not giving me the doscount is that the restaurant does not serve ala carte, and since they decide to serve me out of goodwill (I am neither a celebrity nor a tycoon nor a politician - why the heck would they bend over for me???) they insisted that the Palate Card promo did not apply.Heck, I can afford the bill many times over and I have been to more expensive restaurants, settling more expensive bills but I hate to be cheated and lied to but cunning people. This is the worst behavior in human society. What better word to use on the management, but liars. I advice people out there to be wary of the restaurant. One that goes back on their words, and worst of all, to cover their tracks to hide their errors whilst still acting to be an angel are the worst kind of people. And do you still dare trust them with your food

great meal with fine wines.sure to return if returning to singapore.
attentive staffs.this restaurant makes up for the lack of service in the hotel.the restaurant staff should maybe train the hotel staffs.
5
Have tried many italian restaurants in my lifetime but this was one of its kind. Staffs were fast and attentive. Fresh and quality product at resonable prices. Restaurant manager was very friendly.
5
Just had dinner with 3 lovely ladies at this restaurant. Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner..great food , good service and nice ambience. We shared the "Sicilian Blood Orange with Fennel Salad & Flamingo Salt Flake, the Arrotolata (Smoked Mozzarella, Suckling Pig, Porcini Mushrooms, Grape Sauce and Rucola Salad (Rolled pizza)), Homemade Squid Ink Spaghetti with Alaskan King Crab and Cognac Sauce,Salted baked Mediterranean Sea Bass and to round it off a selection of dessert (Toasted Almond Pannacotta , Signature Tiramisu, choc truffle cake & coffee granita!). The Arroltolata and squid ink pasta were superb the sea bass was very fresh!...and the dessert...definitely worth the extra calories!Together with the company..."e stata una fantastica cena"..

Helmed by the accomplished Chef Lino Sauro the food served at Gattopardo, Singapore, is mainly authentic Sicilian cuisine. There's a rather cool charcoal grill and wood-fired oven for baking gourmet pizzas and diners can expect a different and refreshing style of cooking from Chef Lino, paired to perfection with Sicilian & a huge repertoire of Italian wines.Lino's kitchen at Gattopardo is full of the best imported ingredients from Italy and I love the way they have an impressive array of fresh seafood on display in the restaurant for all the guests to see, and marvel at. The service here is terrific, and some of the dishes we recommend include the Crudo di Cappasanta con Nocciole Tostate e Caviale Affumicato, the Prosciutto di Parma Pio Tosini e Burrata di Andria, the Risone Con Polipo Brasato e Midollo di Bue, the Calamari Alla Brace and the Porchetta Cotta al Forno a Legna. For the dessert, do not miss the I Cannoli Siciliani, which is essentially Crispy Espresso-infused Wafers Filled with Ricotta Cream and Amedei Mousse and you should paired this with the 2010 Malvasia Tasca D Almerita, Sicily (Malvasia). A great restaurant - one of Singapore's gems, for sure! Address:Gattopardo,11 Canning Walk,Hotel Fort Canning,Singapore 178881(65) 6338 5498reservations@gattopardo.com.s

The food was quite average for a top class hotel. Both courses arrived on the table separately, with one of us having to wait for the other person to be served. Service is a bit patchy as no single person took responsibility for serving. Room for improvement, but lets down the hotel a bit
5
Had a fantastic dinner with my wife at Gattopardo last night. Excellent service, good ambience and of course great food!. Try the chargrilled calamari as well as the Parma ham for starters. The Risone pasta (risotto like pasta) with bone marrow is a must! Restaurant is tucked away on a hill (Fort Canning) which offers a nice quiet place for a stroll after the heavy dinner!....Highly recommended..(apologies for the 'darkish' photos!
5
this is one of few italian restaurant really authentic. Chef Lino from Sicily bring in town the most interesting menu in italian restaurant you can find in the boring scene of Singapore. Real recipe from Sicily Raw fish, pasta with sarde, n'duja (from Calabria btw), sicilian cheese, orange salad... Finally a place where you can go without order the burrata and the bolognese pasta. The service is so friendly and they will remember you easily after few times you go there, make you feel home. The place is very elegant too

We went for Sunday brunch with friends and family having previously been on 2 other occasions. The concept of having a brunch where we could order the food 'a la carte' and it be served to us at our table was the main reason for giving it a go. We had a pleasant time, the food is good but the service let things down. We would say that, overall, our experience was fine but with so much choice in Singapore we won't be rushing back anytime soon.The quality of the food is very good and everything we had was delicious. However, the options were limited to (I think) 6 starters, 6 main dishes and 4 desserts plus some cheese. 1 option for the main and another for the starter were at 'extra cost' (I think about $40 for the main) and were, therefore, not included in the set price. The 'a la carte' method does help with food quality and avoid wastage but it does limit your options.The ambience was good with a nice crowd but the acoustics of the room are not good and it did make it difficult to have a conversation at our table.The service was fine but there were a couple of things that disappointed us. Firstly, we had asked for a copy of the menu the day before so we could prepare ourselves. Only 24hrs before our arrival the menu had oysters as a starter but when we arrived they had been removed. The Manager told us that they had had a busy Saturday and the oysters had sold out. We raised the matter again and on the 3rd time the Manager said that they had found 6 and would prepare them for us. We were pleased to get some but it does raise the question why we had to insist before the oysters were found. Secondly, some of our orders did not arrive and at other times we ordered 1 portion of something only to receive a whole tray load, from which we took the 1 portions and sent the rest back to the kitchen

We have dined at this place several times over past years. This time was legendary!We arrived to an empty bar and after being ignored by two waiters was eventually served - but asked to moved from one side of the bar to another ( the place was empty)!?We had reservations and was shown to a bar seat ( next to an empty room)- when reiterated a table reservation we were offered a choice of three!!! So we are literally are walking around the restaurant ... Why she didn't do this in the first place is stunningly ignorant and rude.Then we ask 3 waiters for a menu and all simply walk past...so we're ignored... Eventually a lady serves us and I explain and point out the waiters who ignore us. The lady apologies and I accept but point out that its the 4th apology by her on the night already and we haven't eaten yet! , menus arrive......almost immediately two glasses of champagne arrive and the waiter tells me they are complimentary. My wife exclaims we have not ordered these...but the double confirmation by the waiter makes it clear. But as this waiter leaves, his superior arrives and says' you've not ordered these' and immediately takes them away....At this point. We left the restaurant.Now lets be clear, the senior lady was pretty much on the ball... Food is usually good- fish... But the service was pretty much a disaster, rude, ignorant. In the Singapore with the varied and excellent competition in the market makes this type of performance is pretty much terminal. It really was dreadful. By the way by the time we left... The people who had reserved the ' half of the bar' which is why we were asked to move.... around 60 people of space.... Still hadn't turned up!!Gattopardo- good for italian -fish, and disgraceful for service. Clearly it's either a disconnect between front house and kitchen or its a self indulgent team whom have little concept of customer service. My experience is don't bother to find out....

This is my first time here, invited by friends who made reservations during restaurant week. This is a fairly large restaurant, occupying a large section of the hotel lobby, and it has outside seating as well. It was fairly full when we arrived at 830pm so business is doing well. Our initial server, a German guy, started off well by being friendly and helpful. As it was a pre-determined restaurant week menu, the starter come out almost instantly. The parma ham wrapped around the burrata cheese was very good. The next course was a risone pasta with squid and bone marrow butter. The young lady server wasn't good at describing the dish, and luckily a more senior server came by and gave a much better description. The dish was ok. Next was the main course and some of us had the pork, and the others had the drum fish. They felt the fish was average, and the pork was quite well done and tender. Our dessert was a white chocolate dish and it was as good as the parma starter. Overall a good restaurant, though not spectacula

I enjoyed a good pizza here and a perfect (and huge) tiramisu... give it a go!
4
I was pleasantly surprised by Gattopardo. It is the Italian restaurant within Fort Canning Hotel, but it combines a great internal ambience with wonderful outdoor seatingWe had a griil for 20 people - beautiful Tuna, italian sausage, seabass, calamari, italian breads and a host of other dishes. Service was good. The food presentation was good and the wine list one of the most extensive Italian wine lists in Singapore.THis was a place that was good for young people on a budget (authentic pizzas), romantic evenings for couples or groups such as ours
5
I have now eaten here twice, once with friends, who have lived here for the last five years and is also one of their favourite places to eat,and once on my own. Both times the service and food were excellent. The staff were always attentive, no matter how busy they wereThe prices are very comparable to some places in Clarke Quarys, which is only a 10 minute walk away, it is worth a visit as you won't be disappointed
4
Had both dinner and a lunch here. Wasn't expecting an Italian restaurant when we first arrived but were quite impressed by the personable service and the authentic food. Chef introduced himself and, guess what, he's Italian! Looked to be a nice wine selection as well. One table of businessmen at lunch was simply ordering bottles of wine and tasting them
5
We visited Gattopardo for the second time in 2 years for dinner for 2. Again, spectacular.Pre dinner drinks in the bar were wonderful. Great cocktails in a stylish yet unpretentious environment. We were later taken to our table. Breads salt and olive oil - simple and delicious.The Calamari entree - perfect. For mains we had the Gattopardo Pizza and the Braised Lamb shoulder with Rosemary Potato. Staff - Roberto checked on our drinks and our meals and made the experience personal. The chef introduced himself and genuinely asked if everything to our liking. It was.Dessert - The best Tiramisu and Ill Bianciomangiare imaginable.Perfect

We tried Gattapardo restaurant in Fort Canning Hotel for Sunday brunch back in Feb. it was excellent then - free flow bubbly and wine, endless brilliant starters, a choice of main course, and yummy cheese and desserts. Professional service as well.Back again in April, not the same. It wasn't a brunch, it was an a la carte menu. The food was good, but the service and the timings were amateur. And they ignored our empty glasses, which is the ultimate crime.Would I go again? Not sure, I would need someone else to tell me they are back to their better performance

Went as a group of 3 to celebrate a friend's birthday. We thought that as the restaurant of a boutique hotel we might find a quiet 'gem' of a place. Unfortunately not. Where to begn?- food was ordinary, bland. Dishes that looked good in writing had an uncanny knack of turning up as a very plain version of what you weren't imagining. Blood orange salad was actually a fennel salad with a few segments of Mandarin (seriously) hidden beneath. Scampi pasta had the worlds smallest Scampi. Cassatta was really a form of chocolate mouse- service was shocking - we consistently waited 15 mins after each course for the plates to be removed (the supposed blood orange salad stayed with us on the table the whole night - yikes!). - as a birthday dinner we had organized a cake. To the restaurant's credit they rang to ask the name of the birthday guest the afternoon of our reservation - obviously so they could pipe the birthday boy's name on the cake. At the restaurant we reminded them about the cake towards the end of main course. They said 'we won't forget'. A desert course, desert wine and coffee later, still no cake. By this time we'd had enough of prodding and prompting the staff on their job and just wanted to get out of there. So dissapointed.- wine is over-priced. Yes it is expensive to buy wine in Singapore (definitely tax takes a big chunk from your wallet), but the margins added on top of this are definitely 'not cool' at this place.- atmosphere? All I kept thinking was "this place has no soul".... No typically Italian casual charm and friendliness. Lacks the emotion that even the big hotel restaurants can muster.- attention to the guest - zero. We spent 780 sgd in the place and there wasn't much concern - there seemed to be constantly 4-5 waiters near us doing something else or conferring with each other on something else.So, take your money elsewhere. Vote with your feet and tell the Singaporean restaurant community that you will not pay for this kind of blandness. Maybe for Pizza? Possibly our biggest mistake tonight - maybe as a friendly Pizza place it has a role? We didn't order Pizza so can't say

We visited Gattopardo during Restaurant Week in March 2012. We had a very good menu consisting of a seafood carpaccio, a pasta dish, a meat dish and a desert. The menu was good value for money at SGD 55++ and our best overall dining experience during this yearâ€™s Restaurant Week.On the downside, there could be a few more wines at more affordable prices and the dining hall could do with some improved sound proofing. We would also have preferred a slightly dimmer atmosphere, perhaps with candles on the tables

Dinner with a group of friends. Twelve of us. Excited, we were. Ordered a variety of food. Polipo in Padella con Salsa di Mandorle, Carpaccio di Manzo, Crudo Di Ricciola e Ricci di Mare, Bucatini con le Sarde, Tonnarelli Al Granchio, Zuppa di Pesce "Gattopardo", Porchetta Cotta al Forno a Legna, Ravioloni di Gambero Rosso e Tartufo Nero, Pizza Etna, and a few other dishes and wine.All the dishes served were ordinary. In fact the Squid Ink Spaghetti was hard! It was nowhere near any ordinary restaurant you would dine in Italy. The pizza crust was thick, with the crust simply overpowering the taste of the topping.A friend, unfamiliar with Italian food, decided to play safe, and asked if the chef can prepare a simple Aglio Olio. They could. But it truly tasted horrible. After giving feedback to the server, the dish was returned, and another plate of Aglio Olio was served. There was no difference. There was no taste, except spiciness! We gave up. Returned the dish to the server, and told him that, it was not nice, and we didnt want it anymore.The manager came, and reprimanded us! He stated that, we could not say that the dish is not nice, we could not say that the Aglio Olio does not taste like Aglio Olio! We asked if he had tasted that plate of Aglio Olio. He told us that, he had been eating Italian food for 40years. He eats in the restaurant everyday. He is an Italian. When asked again, if he tasted that plate of Aglio Olio. He finally said, because my friend had already tried it, he would not taste it. Perhaps Mr. Manager realized that he had antagonized the patrons. He came back with a miserable sorbet for my friend who ate barely anything that night. We told him that we did not want it, and please remove it. He told a few of us straight in the face, it is for THE LADY. We were a group of 12 ladies.Frankly, the above was not even close to a fine dining experience in an good Italian restaurant, which claims to serve Italian food as good as what you would get in Italy. Service of the manager was simply arrogant, and horrendous. If you really want to dine there, do not order anything outside the menu. Do not expect too much from the food. Say only good things to the manager and team. It should be fine then.And so, we left, disappointed

The menu is interesting, not your run of the mill italian restaurant in Singapore. Food came served in innovative ways had the Mozzarella di Bufala e Cuore di Bue appetizer which had good flavour and was a generous portion. The Tonnarelli Al Granchio pasta which is crab and squid ink pasta. The squid ink is infused into the pasta so no worries about having a black mouth, lips and tongue. The cognac did provide a wonderful aroma in the mouth as an aftertaste but it's just a hint so savour and experience. And the Arrotolata pizza which was most interesting. It had suckling pig and porcini mushrooms. Although the sucking pig was not crackling but more juicy, the combination was great for me. And it came cut up into pieces on a wooden board, an interesting visual experience but also help in ensuring each bite had a good chunk of everything. Wine pairings available here for desserts. And they have an extensive wine menu. It was full on a saturday night. You might think so what it's a weekend, but this place is situated in a bit of a odd place, fort canning (in a boutique hotel) and isn't the kind of place that experiences any by the way foot traffic.Ambience wise, it's an interesting old place and historic. But once they started getting full, it was difficult to talk as the noise in the restaurant just makes it unpleasant. But if you have a bigger group, they have a couple of dining rooms for private parties so to speak it seems. They also have bar counter seating so that's good if you are dining alone too.Parking is limited so be aware particularly if they have a wedding on, you might find it hard to park in the hotel but there's a car park outside that's for public parking you just have to walk up the hill a bit. It's a hike from the MRT station be warned.Bottom line - will go again

The chef created an excellent menu for us. All of the dishes were interesting and very satisfying.
Very attentive service and overall a great experience.

My wife and I have come to this authentic and consistent Sicilian restaurant on five occasions already and every time we have been transported all the way to Italy with it's food and great wine. Very exciting is their "degustation"menu. I look forward coming there back soon

Found myself at the Hotel Fort Canning for a night, and meetings having deprived me of sustenance, I consulted Tripadvisor for good eats in the area; imagine my surprise when Gattopardo comes up as #36 out of a billion restaurants in Singapore... and it's in my hotel!Okay, I admit that this place has some pretty biased things going for it: Western food (Italian), convenience (I'm staying at the hotel that hosts the restaurant), and decent ratings (#36 on TA Singapore list): still,it provides my most important category: instant gratification - I'm in!! Despite the above, the fantastic fare that's presented: breadsticks that literally defy description (except to say that they are perfectly overdone), Bufala salad that belongs in Roma; and a Le Volte red that should be forbidden by the glass. Have I mentioned that I really liked this restaurant? Had the Rivioloni for Prima, and the Spigola for Seconde - both were excellent. The price point was a bit high, but what are you going to do: it's Singapore, at a 5* hotel restaurant... still: I would dine here again, and again..

I recently went to have a meal with some friends and I am always impressed with how fresh the seafood is, flown in twice weekly from meditarranean! I have been here 5-6 times over the last 2yrs since it's opening and Chef Lino Sauro has never disappointed me! I believe in this case, the food, ambience and service is truly one of its kind. I'm not much of a wine drinker, but Roberto is so helpful and patient to introduce some good selections. Indeed, Gattopardo is deserving of 'BEST restaurant of the year 2011'! What is good here...I recommend the salt baked fish (my favourite) followed by seafood stew... Pastas and pizza here is excellent...florentine beef is gorgeously done...I can go on and on but do call for reservations before heading down as it gets busy especially on weekends

It was a lovely reunion day with Friends from Singy- This place is hard to get to and just about needs a taxi drop-the taxi driver may not know where The Legends (hotel) is, check out the google map for reference. We ended up there on a rainy night, finding a cab at 7:00 pm in Singapore is no cake-walk, so all of us were very late. Thankfully being an odd week day, we had no problems holding our reservation. Fort Canning has a beautiful setting, so does this hotel-we ended up entering from the back door but the front was not that impressive either. However, we take all that back, once we entered the lobby! It was lavish, beautiful display, a small bar, and a lovely entrance to Gattopardo. The place is spacious, very tastefully laid out tables, excellent china but does not require you to be uncomfortable in suits and evening dresses. They will be just as happy to admit you in a pair of shorts. The wine list was exhaustive and everything on the menu sounded great-what made me most inclined towards coming here again was the large number of choices for vegeterian people. They often get left out with only a choice of penne arabiatta! In Singapore, it is strange that in some restuarants, it is customary to order bread, it does not expertly appear on your table with your wine bottle. I was inordinately pleased to get endless amounts of warm, freshly baked bread-and almost made a meal of it before the starters were ordered. We had to instruct the staff not to serve anymore of it. We shared Mozzarella di Bufala e Cuore di Bue, Prosciutto di Parma Pio Tosini, a rucola salad and I had the Ravioli con Burrata e Crescione. Simply fantastic, I found the watercress sauce a bit on the bitter side for my taste but the Burrata was worth it. The Spaghetti alla Norma was delicious, and we ended up reordering it to share. Pizza was standard, the calzone was gigantic, i think two people can easily share it. We did have an issue of freshness with Linguine alle Vongole. However the chef himself stopped by, apologized profusely and remade the dish-it was fixed. To top it, we got a platter of free cookies with our coffee. The tiramisu that followed was great, but I still vote for the one from Da Paulo's deli in Holland village as the best. I tried Cannoli Siciliani for dessert and um..um...umumum! It's bad manners to talk with my mouth full. Though getting in and out was a problem, this is a great place-for a date if you choose food over a romantic setting as a couple, a quiet business dinner or a simple meeting up of friends! Try it

Took my girlfriend here for her birthday on a Wednesday night back in September, we were immediately impressed by the setting and ambience of the Fort Canning Hotel - great old style colonial elegance restored to its former glory, air conditioned of course!Started with a couple of happy hour cocktails on the terrace overlooking Fort Canning Park, nice to see the European Head Bar Maid step in when the locals were struggling with a basic Pina Colada! :-)Dinner was inside, shown to our seats by the affable and friendly concierge (Italian) who clearly knew his wines and meats, with good advice on my choice of taking the taster menu, which was all fish-based and fantastic, while the gf had the most amazing and tender pork belly either of us had ever tasted.Service was always attentive and considerate, without being overbearing, and timings of food serving were spot on. No room for dessert unfortunately as were just too stuffed and satiated with the incredibly rich food, though the gf was surprised with a complimentary ice cream for the heck of it!Overall, a very pleasant and easy evening, the only slight negative was that the a la carte was a little lacking in other quality meats such as venison, veal, fois gross etc but perhaps something the venue will address

We had a late dinner at Gattopardo ("Leopard" in Italian) Italian Grill while we were staying at Hotel Fort Canning. Their room service menu looked very interesting, and we had wanted to try their food for some time, but on previous nights, the earliest we could make a reservation was 9:30 p.m. because they had been catering to special functions. Although it is inside the hotel, the restaurant is separately managed, so it is not possible to charge meals to the hotel bill. We shared an order of herb-roasted pork belly with potato and spinach. It was very good. For dessert we had coffee flavored cannoli and tiramisu which were good. Although they maintain a large wine cellar on the premises, we could not find the white wine that we wanted. The sweetest wine they had was a Ben RyÃ© Passito di Pantelleria. The atmosphere was quiet and friendly, the food was very good, and the service was helpful. The chef came to the table to see if everything was to our taste. The quality divided by the price would bring our dining experience to the area a bit below below "very good.

First a word of caution. Gattopardo is located in the Hotel Fort Canning, but don't breeze in expecting to be able to charge it to your room (as I did) you can't. It's not the hotel's restaurant. Anyway despite my lack of money and credit cards they were very friendly and didn't make me wash the dishes.My impression of Gattopardo is that this is very much a 'business' restaurant. On the night I visited all the customers (bar a table of ladies that lunch) looked like they were on expense accounts. The menu and wine list are priced accordingly. I wasn't overly hungry (and my expense account is small) so I opted for the pizza. It was very nice, good and hot with generous toppings and excellent salami sausage, but a part of me rather uncharitably says 'well you'd expect that for the most expensive pizza you've bought'. It was good, and other reviews here suggest the rest of the menu is good.The restaurant, although part of an old colonial masterpiece lacks something in atmosphere. Not much here suggests italian, although both menu and wine list stick rigidly to an all italian policy.There seemed to be an enormous number of waiters, which can lead to them being over attentive, but this wasn't the case and the service was exemplary.All in all I can't complain but it just felt like it should have delivered more

We were a party of 6 and received a very nice spacious table.Gattopardo has a nice selection of fresh seafood that can be tasted with pasta, as fish soup (my friend loved it) or even as main course.Unconventional or fully traditional sicilian dishes , everything was excellent.My favorite? The Wagyu carpaccio! (and it doesn't cost a fortune).The wines? Tried the white and the Syrah from Planeta, definitively worth the price.Well done Lino, I will come back for sure
