if you are through with shopping at Harbourfront mall , you should visit this place for a nice lunch or dinner with a variety of non vegetarian food ... Amazing food at reasonable prices. A must visit if you love your chicken legs ..

Has Muslim staff,and quite nice for a quick bite. Fried chicken was very tender and delicious. Could do with more variety though.

Texas Chicken has chicken burgers and nothing else so if you hate chicken then don't eat here because then I don't know what happens

I did not want to eat mcDonalds and we were looking for close alternative and saw texas chicken, We had never eaten in texas chicken before so this was the first time and it was totally worth it. We took the mexican chicken and the size of the burger, in that price, and the taste were amazing. Definitely worth trying. We wanted to try more from the menu but could not. may be next time

Is a must try place. Is only fastfood place my father likes it so much. Others, he eats with no comment. He's not a picky eater. But this is a must try place for its biscuits. Eat it while its hot. As its only time the biscuits is deliciou
