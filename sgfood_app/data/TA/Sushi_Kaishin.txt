We had the take course, was totally enough and made me so full. Such a good quality, no compromises.

We loved it ! It was wonderful to eat sushi the traditional way. Prepared for you, in front of you by the chef. The fish was beautiful and I was really pleasantly surprised to have fresh sea urchin. The chef is friendly and explained everything he prepared for us. The restaurant is tiny but very cosy. Yes, pricy but worth it. Mind you, this has nothing to do with the ' all you can eat sushi' you find all over Europe. Highly recommend

This restaurant is tiny, with just a few bar seatings and a small private room. Nicely intimate.There were a few Japanese clients and local clients sitting by the sushi bar the night we dined.The menu provides a selection of omakase choices (3 price tiers), a la carte options and specials of the day.We tried their top-priced omakase menu - $200 per person - it included appetizers, sushi, sashimi and some cooked dishes. My expectations for the food was high based on this price.The quantity of the food was good.The quality of the food however was uneven. To be fair, the appetizers and most of the seafood tasted passably fresh. The tamago sponge was also wonderfully silky and bouncy. However, I had a piece of extremely unfresh, half-defrosted, spongey crab that bordered on tasting like crabsticks. Unimpressive for what I had anticipated was a high calibre restaurant.The sushi chef at the bar (he was Japanese so this made it doubly disappointing) was also very lackadaisical with his sashimi slicing. Actually I believe alot of the fish for the sashimi and sushi were pre-sliced as I would see them all laid out on a paper-lined metal tray. The fish pieces were raggedy-edged. And although I suppose he was practicing good hygiene but I felt his constant handwashing and wipe-down and rinsing really diluted the flavor of the sushi and sashimi - his hands were always dripping with water from his constant washing... I've seen other high calibre Japanese sashimi chefs work and this is the first time I'm seeing one with hands constantly dripping water all over the food. Really not what I would expect from a restaurant commanding such high prices.Overall, I was really disappointed, particularly with the food. I have no desire to return and would definitely not recommend anyone to try this place

Sushi Kaishin is a Sushi restaurant tucked up a little side alley in Robertson Quay, away from the crowds. I'd stumbed across a recommendation for Sushi Kaishin in a travel blog so decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did. I think locals here are trying to keep this place a secret as I couldn't find hardly any reviews online and that's a shame as this is the real deal. It really is good. We went on a Saturday evening. Sushi Kaishin only seats 12 people at the bar looking over the craftsmanship of Ichiyam-san. There is only him, a guy in the kitchen and a waitress. It's a small and simply decorated but a perfectly formed operation. We opted for the Umi menu around $100 each. It was so delightful to watch Ichiyam-san skillfully craft each piece of fish. The fish was so divinely tender. Everything was blissfully enjoyed by my husband and I. We also tasted a few sakes, which will take your bill up a tad, but again he has many options. I loved the attention to detail whereby you could chose what ceramic or glass Sake holder you would like to drink from. Really nice touch. Ichiyam-san seemed a very approachable man and you could see that he loves what he does with his heart. I wish that more people knew of this gem as it was quiet for a Saturday night.We left with a bill around $340 for 2. I think that the lunch menu's are cheaper. It's the best sushi so far in my life although it's not cheap, but you pay for quality fish. The ambience depends on who is in the restaurant. For us it was perfect as date night, there were only 3 girls enjoying a birthday and a solo businessman. All looked very satisfied. You won't find a website so for reservations call. I loved this place
