When in Changi Airport Terminal 3, don't miss this small noodle bar in Basement 2. I always order the Signature Beef Boat Noodle, Mango Sticky Rice with Sea Coconut and the Thai Milk Tea. Just awesome. Keep me going back.

Walked by and happened to see this outlet. Got interested but pretty full and ordered the mango glutinous rice and Thai milk tea. Overall, good enough but price on the steeper side. All in all around $8.80:(

The beef portion is quite good. Price is ok. It's more comfortable to have noodle soup rather than fried chicken before landing. The interior design is not bad. Have big round table. The taste is fast food style.

Food court price, food court quality. I had the chicken porridge which was pretty normal. The bandung was a bit odd and the lime tea a tad too sweet. Considering the options in the airport, I suppose it's an ok place to grab a meal.

This little Thai bar is located at Terminal 3, basement 2. I always go there when I am staying at a Singapore airport hotel. It’s excellent value for money. I both like the Thai seafood soup (Tom Yam) and the ‘porridge’. Don’t be misled by the name, it is also a soup. These dishes are inexpensive (about 6 Singapore dollars) and very good. Also, you can make it as spicy as you like (big bowl where spoons and chopsticks are)

All the meals looked so similar on the menu but tried dry noodles and also a pork dish (which was really spicy). This is a fast food type restaurant so for value for money, it is very reasonable. Did like the soda water type drink - - bit like raspberry lemonade but even better. Service was good and even though it is not to my taste, it was very popular with locals. Worth a try

Brought Mum out to Ikea shopping and cod it was raining cats and dogs, we decided to head over to Changi airport for some dinner as we will not have trouble getting parking lots and the car park is within the building. As it was close to 8pm, we went for an outlet that did not have a queue waiting to get in. That was how we decided on Aoy's for dinner. After ordering however, we had to wait for our food but it was worth it! Love the food!We ordered the beef noodle as well as the Tom yam seafood noodle. Mmmmmm... lovely. Even the sticky glutinous rice with mango was yummy. Will definitely return.

They accept Visa/MC which of course is helpful when traveling through Singapore and not wanting to exchange money.We had one order of chicken and noodles dry and the same as soup. Our expectations were met an the price was quite good. Cost for two meals is similar to one lunch in US at a food court. For us, serving size would be good for lunch but was a bit small for dinner. We stopped at another place in the basement for something else.A great option for those spending some time outside security at Changi. I was really surprised how many people were in the mall that didn't appear to be travelers (no luggage in tow) so many of the people eating at Aoy's must be local

Being to Changi T3 basement many times but have not patronize this outlet before. There is always a queue at the cashier placing orders.Today we decided to try it. Ordered beef noodle soup, chicken noodle soup, mango tango and peanut-honey toast. The noodles are just average, the mango tango is just normal and toast comparing to toast-box is below par.Overall the food is just average and the pricing is on the high side

We ordered two sets for $20.70, which we thought was reasonable at the airport. Previously, I had eaten at the nearby Champion Ramen, spending over $55 for two portions.We went with the Wanton noodles, as well as the Beef boat noodles. One set came with the mango tango drink, while the other came with a coke. The wonton noodles were good. The beef noodles were not bad - the beef slices were rather tough, but the broth was not bad.We also ordered the mango with glutinous rice. It was okay, though there could have been more mango slices for the price
