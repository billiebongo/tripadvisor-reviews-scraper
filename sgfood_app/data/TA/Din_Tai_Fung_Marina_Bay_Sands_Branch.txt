DTF is always good, always consistent, always efficient. I like the ordering system and I like the fact that the place is really clean. But to me, the staff at the MBS branch seemed to be somewhat sullen or unresponsive.
5
The service is not quite as good as the one in causeway Bay in Hong Kong, but the food is just as good and the green vegetables and prawn dumplings which I had were faultless.
5
Lunchtime visit
Loved the food the service was good
Polite and helpful staff ,food arrived promptly and with a smile

Din Tai Fung is our favorite restaurant for dumplings and more Chinese food. We have been to many branches of DTF in Australia and China and the quality of the food is consistently excellent. For newbies, the ordering system might be a bit weird but once you know what you want to eat it is easy. You probably have to wait in line anyway so you have time to study the menu and make your choices. some of our favorites: xiao long bao (try the crab/pork they are the best), fried rice, pork buns, wonton soup with shrimp/pork dumpling
5
Normally the idea of standing outside a restaurant, filling in my order on a form before sitting down and being in a queue for 20mins would send me scuttling for the next establishment.Not a chance her, it is all part of the experience, and the food is worth every minute of the wait.Priced really well against most others in Marina Bay, great experience all round, will be back, do not miss this on

I tried this restaurant and another located in Chinatown. The service of the two places was different. This one was better, faster - however the place itself was much busier. I found it nice to have a menu with pictures and also the way you placed your order: ticking your choice on a pre-printed sheet means less misunderstandings. The waiters checked the status of my order (level of completion) on the bill, also ticking what served. It is really nice that you can see how the cooks are preparing dumplings and wontons. You even get your steamed dumplings served in the bamboo steamer. (Note: the photo was taken at the restaurant located in Chinatown.
5
We love the food at Din Tai Fung and go back regularly. Never had a bad experience and enjoy the several branches around Singapore. Our go-to dishes are the duck entree, vegetable and pork dumplings, beef noodle soup, egg fried rice and the peanut dumplings for dessert
5
Visited last with week with partner and friend.The ordering method seems a bit daunting at first; you get a clipboard, pen and sheet, with all the food items and an accompanying booklet with pictures. Soon becomes self explanatory that you write the quantity on the sheet of whatever you like; was glad my friend (who is now a local) was there to explain!! Restaurant was heaving, and I think it’s testament to the fact that their food is soooo good! You can watch the chefs making the dim sum in the window - really fascinating to see. Food comes out as and when it’s ready, so you know it’s going to be hot and fresh. Would highly recommend as a place to try really really really top notch dim sum

I came here on the recommendation of a few people, and it lived up to the hype. The dumplings were awesome.We got the pork and truffle, pork and crab meat xiao long bau's, the shrimp and pork Sui mau, drunken chicken, crispy duck parcels and some greens with the kailan. It was all delicious. The dumplings were among the best I've had, bags of flavour. The shrimp and pork Sui mau in particular were my favourite. The crispy duck parcels wonderfully moorish, the kailan was awesome too. A veg I've not had before, crispy storks with soft leaves.Will definitely be coming back before I leave Singapore
5
I have been there a couple of times and I always liked it. Food is so awesome good. I like the sweets and the soups, and actually the whole menu. The Ambiente is a little cold and it is always busy there, you can be sure that you have to wait for a seat. But every tasty bit is worth the wait
4
First time in Singapore and first time in a Din Tai Fung. Loved it! There was a 20 min wait but much worth it. We returned twice during our stay in Singapore and weren't disappointed. Would love to come back!
3
Took my wife and kids here (6 & 7 year olds). Food was alright, but the service was terrible. Had to get up and get someone to help out twice.
4
One of the most difficult things to achieve in a restaurant is consistency, particularly a chain. DTF exceeds all consistency standards I have seen. Whilst not as extensive a menu here in Singapore as in Shanghai or Hong Kong, what was on it was excellent.
4
We had a very good experience. We had made reservations (recommended). We did not have to wait or order from a board outside as another reviewer wrote. It was very busy, so the wait for the food was a bit long, but not terrible. Everyone had good food. Travel lesson learned: As in many other Singaporean restaurants, there were NO NAPKINS. We saw locals pull their own wipes out of their purses
5
We had lunch here earlier while browsing the shops at Marina Bay Sands and I have to say, WOW! We ordered all sorts of dumplings and pork buns which were amazing. But the shrimp and pork wonton soup was incredible! Best wontons I've ever tasted. You can watch the chefs roll the dumplings as you walk in. Really an excellent experience
5
My favourite food experience in Singapore. Cannot get enough of those delicious xiao long bao. Also order the red bean paste dumplings every time. The beans are mashed and warm. Even though you often have to line up to get in, the wait is not usually too long and so worth it.
1
We had heard that this place good so planned a visit on the way to Gardens by the Bay. You ask for a table, get given a ticket, and have to pick your meal off a board out the front of the restaurant. We didn't expect this for a fairly pricey place. There was only one menu to look at and it was very crowded. We ordered free flow water and pork and prawn dumplings, chicken dumplings, pork steamed buns, green vegetables, egg fried rice, and pork and mushroom noodles. We didn't get any water when we sat down. The noodles came out quickly and came out first, which was odd. The following are in Singapore dollars. They were pretty bland and small and cost $10.80. The prawn and pork dumplings were 6pcs for $9 and were flavourless. The chicken dumplings were very small and cost $11.80 for 10pcs, they were ok but had a weird aftertaste. We still had no water after eating this all. It was very hard to catch staff members attention. We then got the greens, which were terrible and so bland. I love Asian greens, but these were $14 and were sour with tasteless sauce and were a small portion. The egg fried rice was small and cost $8.80 - also flavourless and was just egg, peas and rice. We didn't receive refills of our supposed free flowing water that we had paid for. We left unhappy to have spent $70 and were not only hungry, but had a bad taste in our mouths. We love dumplings and eat them weekly back home. We expected so much more.
4
It's crowded during lunch that we had to wait for 15 minutes for the food to start flowing but it wasn't so bad. Truffle dumplings were something to endulge, cucumber salad and tofu salad good light complement and finished with DTF fried rice. There were few other things we ordered but just right enough for lunch
5
Din Tai Fung never disappoints. very good steamed dumplingsThe queueing system varies depending on how busy it is. Often you will get a table straight away, but if not, you are given a number and an order ‘chit’ and you can peruse a large visual menu board as you wait for your number to be called for your table
4
Stopped here on the recommendation of a friend. We were not disappointed. We had an order of chicken dumplings and shrimp and pork dumplings. Also, drunken chicken and prawn pancake. All of it tasty.The above listed and 2 waters came to a little less than $50
4
Very good steamed dumplings being serviced by waiters that look like operating room nurses with masks and white hats. Especially enjoy the shrimp and pork dumplings. The sweet ice tea was better than the beer.
5
Great choice for a business dinner. Food and service were excellent. Very nice location. Large tables available for large groups.
5
this is the right place for the best dumpling ever. this restaurant is so popular in Asia and they must have a good way to control the standard
5
Wauw the best dumplings ever! So much great food that's a most visit in Singapore! Highly recommended.
2
after waiting for 20 minute and share table. Service is below average.. food is not as good as other locations such as Taiwan and Los Angeles.
1
Very disappointed ordered pork mince and rice dumplings was basically just rice when I asked the manager he said if I wanted pork I should have just ordered pork????Staff had no grasp of what contained gluten and didnâ€™t seem to understand the importance of a coeliac not consuming gluten.$82 later dissatisfied and still hungry
5
The restaurant We stayed at the Marina Bay Sand Hotel for a week. I was at this Din Tai Fung Restaurant (Marina Bay Sands Branch) three times.... Twice for lunch and once for dinner. It was perfect with efficient and friendly staffs. You can view how the staffs fold the dumplings. The restaurant was very busy but worth the wait. The restaurant is well organized and clean. The food quality is excellent!!
4
Din Tai Fung is amazing - let's just cut to the chase here. Food is great. Service is a little slow at this location and I felt rushed when I was here. I came with my partner on a Friday around 1PM but still. Overall, would come back since this location is on the way to the gardens
5
One of the cheapest options in the mall. Dumplings are amazing and a must try (they are famous because of those). Expect to queue for an entrance to the restaurant, you get a number then you wait until its called, in the meantime complete your order. Expect to pay about 50SGD for a meal for two. You can see how they make the dumplings and the hard work behind it. Must try, there are also other Dai Fung across Singapore like Sentosa for example.
5
What can I say, lunch 3 times at this famous restaurant. Food is great, xiao long bao is what you need to eat, and be careful with your chopsticks as if you break them, the soup will be all over you.Usually queues, but less than at other branches downtown, worth the wait, but again, go for what they r famous for xiao long bao
3
One of the more affordable dinner options in the marina mall. Food was good, service was only ok. If you have an shellfish allergy there are a few options.
4
Din tai fung never disappoints. Lovely food. Quite expensive but same as Hong kong. Lively and easy to find. Good to watch the chefs prepare the food.
5
Wow, amazing choice, great service, clean, traditional and an experience you have to try if in Singapore!
5
One of the best chinese restaurant ive ever been, the food quality is Amazing, especially for me that loved so much Chinese cuisine.
4
As usual , this restaurant will never let you down. Any outlet will have q. So be early to get tables
1
I started to write a very long winded piece. Then thought who will read this? So, I just want to say I have lived in Singapore for 10 years and never ever experienced service as bad, anywhere in Singapore, as I received at this outlet last night. Never again!
5
This is a must-visit in Singapore. There are a few of these restaurants around town so any of them will do. Traditional Dim Sum which you order by filling out a little form and then they start bringing everything to you as it is available. You must try the soup dumplings which you eat by placing on in your spoon, stabbing it with a chopstick to let the broth out into the spoon, then you drink the broth and eat up the delicious dumpling. Excellent
5
We were recommended this chain by a friend who lived in Singapore for several years and we ended up eating there twice at different locations. Great value for money for Singapore standards, efficient service and amazing variety of dim sum and other specialties. Do not miss the truffle and the vegetarian ones!!
3
My husband, myself and our 2 teenage sons had lunch here and my overall impression was a very busy and noisy restaurant. The service was impersonal and unfriendly and I wasn't impressed with the dumplings we ate. It wasn't a relaxing meal and I was glad to leave
4
This outlet is very crowded. Lunch or dinner, the queue is always there. Having dinner here as past few visits saw the outlet was always with crowd.Reached there about 6pm, and was about 10 groups infront of us and already booked for a queue number. A group was lead in by the waitress and when she came back and asked us for how many person. We told her for two and immediately she lead us in for the table, so happen there was a table for two.Ordered the famous Xiao long bao, white meat reap cucumber, toa miao fried with garlic, pork rib fried rice with egg and peanut dumplings with coconut. The price is not much different from other outlets. The quality is good except the Xiao long bao.
5
Very good restaurant for lunch or dinner or even a snack. Beef is very good and the dumplings are outstanding. Highly recommend it for friends and family.
5
Gorgeously fresh and tasty dim sum. Highly recommend the steamed pork dumplings, steamed angle guord and prawns and prawn/vegetable noodle soup. It's a little expensive but worth the price for the flavour.
4
This is a must go place for dimsums and dumplings in Singapore!!
The service is super slow..but the food is good..!! and the menu has a lot of variety !!
4
quite a queue for dinner here, but the food is always good. The must try xiao long bao is good here. they also have a chili crab meat bao here that pays tribute to singapore famous chili crab. The chicken soup is also good.
5
I came here on a Sunday around 8pm and the wait was around 20 minutes. I ended up ordering takeaway and my order came in 20 minutes. They package the food nicely and have lots of vegetarian options. Tip: if you're ordering takeaway, you can walk straight to the counter
4
So tonight I had more time and didn't mind the 25 minute wait (which was actually 30 minutes). You get a number and an order sheet when you check in. Have it filled out before your table is ready! When they call your number you give the host your order sheet and go to your table. It is a unique system designed for efficiency. This is not a place to relax. It's loud, crowded, and you constantly hear doorbell sounds from numbers being called. I'm trying the sweet and sour pork for the first time. Also ordered the dumplings and buns I tried last night. The S&S pork was pretty good. Don't expect a lot of service. If you want to relax and be waited on, this isn't your place. If you want good dumplings and buns then it's great.
5
Food is so nice that it becomes my ritual everytime I visit Singapore. Din Tai Fung serves chinese food, they are mainly known for their Xiao Long Bao. But, I was there for their fried-rice with fried pork chop. If you love Xiao Long Bao, you should give their Truffle Xiao Long Bao a try! It cost more than the regular one, but it is a different experience where they mix the flavor of western and very simple Chinese steam food
5
Food is valued at great price and service is great! good came as soon as they were ready so eat up before they get cold.During Lunch and Dinner time, there was a wait time for hungry costumers but they had it all under control and everyone get seated quickly
5
Wow!! We had a 6 hour layover in Singapore and went to Din Tai Fung for our lunch. Having been to other branches in KL and Bangkok we knew it would be good, but it exceeded out expectations. Busy but well organised, with great staff. Highly recommend.
5
It may seem crowded at diner but they are very well organized and call you quickly. The place is well-arranged so even though there's lots of clients you don't feel it's noisy. The dumplings are delicious and the xiao long bao superb. I also recommend the wantan noodle soup for those who don't appreciate normal dumplings
5
Wonderful dim sum. Wide variety and plenty of selections. Prompt courteous service. Fun to watch the cooks prepare the dim sum.
5
This place served us she amazing food. The service is rushed, the whole thing is very impersonal and has the feel of fast food but the quality of the food is sublime. Very tasty, Def recommend.
5
I tried lots of different din tai fung and surely this is one of the best . Staff is professional and fast and everything is really clean . Food is fantastic and menu is various as usual .
To be tried !!!!!
5
I Always make time to visit when in town, great quality food all cooked to perfection, wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to fellow travellers, and very reasonably priced
4
I was recommended to come here by a friend and I was not disappointed. Although we couldn't eat in, we ordered take away and sat in the food court to eat so can't comment on the service. The food itself was amazing. The dumplings were fresh and melts in your mouth. I would definitely recommend eating here as you would not regret it
1
I was keen to eat here because we had been to this chain before and enjoyed the experience however the staff were obviously just too busy. It took ages to take our food and drinks order and then we were still waiting 30 mins for anything (including the drinks) to arrived.
1
This was the second time visiting this restaurant. We had a small wait as usual as it's always busy. We ordered 2 main plates and several plates to try. The tasting plates and 1 main came out. I asked incase my main soup had been forgotten the staff member stated it would be out in 5 minutes. After half an hour and other people who came after us had come and gone I asked again please can I have my soup they stated they'd forgotten and it would take a further 4 minutes. We continued to wait and eventually my soup arrived. Obviously rushed as the broth was the most tasteless disappointing soup. On paying for my meal I explained this and asked for a discount. They stated it was not possible. Overpriced and uncaring. We do not recommend this place
4
We did go back but this time to another venue (Marina Bay Sands) and it was equally as good as the first venue (Chinatown Point). We took some friends with us and they were as impressed as we had been. We ordered some similar things but also added some other items off the menu and we loved them all. The only slight negative was that not all things ordered came at the same time and we had a green vegetable dish served to us after we had finished everything else! Have found that that happens often in Singapore restaurants...not sure why? But great food, spacious seating and competent staff although I was a little surprised that some spoke no English at all. Would definitely recommend
5
we didnt make any reservations. we Qed for 20 minutes ( not too bad ) for dinner. but all worth it as the food satisfied our taste buds. staff-wise everyone seems to be rushing . but nevermind the not so friendly staff. we came for the food.
5
Same great tasting food here as it is in California USA. Very fine and delicious.Delicately made XLB (xiao long bao). Long lines but categorized by guest count.Tip: 1. order xia long bao. "a must"2. Tiger beer bottle is great but a little expensive at S$11.80 3. Ask for a "bag basket" for your belongings to put while dinin
5
Very good dim sum. It is run like a well oiled machine but isn't as "friendly" as other places; probably due to the high volume of people. The service is quick and efficient.
3
dumpling are pretty good. staff need to respect customers a little better.
They need to learn to focus on the food rather than getting your bill to your table in less than 20s after you order.
5
The waiting period only made us salivate more but was worth it. Fast & efficient service from very friendly staff made our lunch enjoyable.
4
it is a resto we can eat a simple.
Not too man choice of menu.
good food, not too much and nice taste.
very good resto
5
We had Dinner there at a Friday evening, so it was clear that we had to wait in line before we could be seated. We waited only about 20 min, the Staff was very attentive and apologized for the inconvenience. The Dumplings are some of the best we have ever eaten.Sure we will eat again at Din Tai Fung
5
We had a late lunch around 1:30pm and this place looked popular so we decided to try. We got seated and served rather quickly, so I recommend going later after the lunch rush. The chicken dumplings and pork buns were out of this world. Fried rice was pretty spectacular too! We looked later and realized the buzz, so we were happy to experience it on our own, without recommendation or expectation. The food tasted very clean to me. It is simple, yet with pure ingredients! I loved it. Best dumplings I've ever had
5
We frequent several DTF outlets.. and have never been disappointed. Our order is pretty standard since the options for vegetarians are limited. However what amazes us every single time is the consistency of flavours. If you are vegetarian, do please order the spinach and mushroom dumplings, not to be missed
5
We have eaten Yum Cha lunch all over the world,however this would have to be in the best 2 or 3 ever we arrived for lunch about 1 pm and was about 2 dozen people out front so we got ticket and menu where you can pre fill for your lunch as they don't run trolley service as in a lot of Chinese Yum Cha restaurants do, All the food was cooked fresh once we were seated,It was divine we had a great variety of dishes and they were all divine, Too hard to call out a special dish as they were all that goo
5
I am not in the habit of lining up for food, but was encouraged by friends to visit one of these Dumpling restaurants in Singapore. One word, amazing, and we only waited about 20 minutes before we were seated. While you are waiting you can watch how the dumplings are made. Make time and visit one of these great restaurants, you won't regret it
4
Got there just before close time after some shopping. People were still waiting for tables. We had to order our food before being taken to our tables. The food started to roll in immediately .Pork in garlic, duck rolls,bao,dimsums and fried rice all were fantastic. Missed one of our order but didn't get charged for the wrong one. Food eaten bill paid and out in 40 min flat,as the open kitchens were cleaning up. "Express road to dimsum heaven.
3
Had the opportunity to have dinner at MBS branch. It is quite crowded for a mid week night. Service was a little slow due to the crowd, but the staff were efficient and attentive. The fried rice was ok, noodles and dumplings were ok.
4
We ate here after an afternoon exploring Gardens By The Bay. The food we ordered we good, however, most of our first choices were 'unavailable'. The sweet & sour pork was good, as well as the Dim Sum.
4
Nothing to complain abt their food but yes this place is packed anytime, you need to get the order sheet and get the queue number at the door and wait for your turn to call.My favorite drink is lemongrass and iced earl grey tea. Its a must to order their Xiao long bao
5
When I mentioned this place from TA to the girl at the information desk at the cruise terminal, she responded that it is her favorite restaurant. Easily reached by the subway; then, get directions within the Marina Bay Sands mall with map.The cooks prepare the dim sum freshly after you order - you can watch them working from the walkway in the mall. Everything was quite delicious! Both various dumplings and noodle soup. Seating was pleasant and service was prompt and courteous.A bit more pricey and the places in the food court, but we are glad we tried it. A nice experience in a great town
4
We've been before, we will be back again!Although you have to wait you can wander round the shops and keep popping back to check your number.The dumplings are freshly made, you can watch the chefs work madly away through the viewing room out front.The hot and sour soup was disappointing, I think they forgot to add the hot & sour elements! We loved the dumplings we chose and the service once seated was quick
5
We had diner here yesterday and I have to say it is a must!! We didn't like this type of food when we tried it before, but this was wow! Especially the buns and wantons :) the food is real cheap for a Michelin star restaurant. We paid 50â‚¬ and our tummies were really full
4
Always great food and fast service. Never been disappointed with the dumplings or rice/noodle dishes. Only deduction of one point is done because of sometimes very long waiting. Online booking system would help but instead you need to take a number at the restaurant and wait for your turn.
5
Went for brunch and a combination of the speedy service and pristine food make this place reliably satisfying. Had the duck fried in crispy wrap and xialong bau (soup dumplings) and walked away a satisfied customer. No lines and no fuss in the Marina Bay sands restaurant
4
We visited this branch as it was close to hand when in the mall, as with all DTF the menu is fairly consistent and the quality was good.I almost always go for the Steamed Pork Dumplings, Pork Bun, Spicy Vegetable and Pork Wonton with a couple of other random picks each time that is more than enough. The menu differs slightly from country to country so nice to try something different.The food is quick, service efficient if lacking in warmth and the price decent.Enjoyed the visit, as did my wife and daughter so worth a trip in Singapore and will be back
4
Very good for dinner after Gardens by the bay light show.Good food selection and quite authentic Dim Sum and the style is just as usual.The location makes it somhow special as it is underneath the Marina Bay Sands and very close to the Gardens by the Bay
4
More than 10 years and counting, I patronizes DTF every other month for the delicious Xiao Long Bao.
5
This international noodle and dumpling chain from Taiwan provides consistently excellent food regardless of which location one chooses. This location is no exception. If you are a fan of Chinese cooking this is well worth a visit.
3
Whenever we see a Din Tai Fung we will go out of our way as we love it. However the service here was extremely poor. The only good thing was the food.
5
Great inexpensive restaurant with nearly perfect dumplings. The only problem is very long line, but it is definitely worth waiting.
4
Dumplings in all varieties and other Chinese food is really good here. Being full already at 5pm in the afternoon is also a good sign in this regard.The service, though, is apparently suffering a bit from huge crowds. I had to ask 2 times for a cup and it would not come. Overall you should come here for the food and accept lack of ambiance and service
5
First of all, seeing the wait time/que for this restaurant meant how good the place is. Second, their menu boasts a large selection of delicious dimsum, rice dishes, soup, and more. We ordered XLBs, Porkchop with rice, Stir fried veggies, and Shrimp dumplings. The portions are good for sharing and everything tasted great! The place is big and good for any occasion.
4
We had never been to one of these before but it was quite full so always a good sign so we went in. We were served by a very pleasant waitress with a beautiful smile & she helped us through their process of ordering. It was different but efficient by filling in the form provided with what you want to order. We had dumplings all around, they are a favourite & were melt in the mouth delicious. We also had them in the broth for main course & weren't disappointed. IT WAS $33.50 all up with bottomless tea for 2 of us. Will probably go ther again if we get time this trip. Marina Bay Sands complex is certainly worth a look
5
Visited this place during my trip to Singapore in Feb. This is the best place to have dumplings, I became fond of dumplings after visiting this place. I made sure I visited the chain again during my stay and did so at another outlet.A must visit
3
Din Tai Fung has about 20 branches spread across every corner of Singapore but I guess the branch at MBS is one of the more popular ones. It is situated in the restaurant quarter of MBS. A bit hard to find as MBS is a huge complex.We had to wait for about 20 minutes despite the fact that we had secured a booking number earlier. We spent the time browsing the menu so we were ready to order as soon as we sat down.Each of us had a bowl of various types of noodle dishes and shared two baskets of dial long bau. The latter was delicious! They were tiny dumplings, piping hot and filled with meat and a little soup of its own. You have to pop the little rascals into your mouth and enjoy them. Whatever you do, don't take small bites! Service was brisk and efficient but nothing outstanding.A quick and tasty lunch
5
I was there in February-2017, it was a rainy day, me & my wife decided to try this restaurant (First timers in Singapore), initially we ordered only dumplings (just to try), result was mind blowing, I have never tasted such good dumplings, staff was very helpful in making food selections, later we Xiao Long bao, it has some sort of soup inside, strongly recommends this, its a must try, beef soup was also good.Overall it's an awesome restaurant, will be visiting surely next time when I will be back in Singapore
4
Really superb freshly made steamed dumplings, in a busy 'canteen' environment. Spotlessly clean and good service.
4
Excellent service and food. Helpful staff and even an instruction card on the best way to eat their dumplings. Enjoyed the experience.
5
There is no slap dash here, the dim sum is all prepared with care and precision. The specialty of the house is a dumpling Xiao Long Bao which also contains a bit of soup inside. It is a must try but be sure you eat it in one bite. The menu board outside is helpful in making menu selections which you must do before entering and sitting down. Service is brisk and efficient, bring your own ambiance and focus on the food which is absolutely delicious. Pay at the front desk as you leave. I am now waiting for them to open a restaurant in London..
5
Whilst this is a chain, a friend living in Singapore told us about DTF. It's absolutely delicious and a fun experience. Very busy at peak meal times but they move people through pretty quickly. Amazing variety and something for everyone- good portion sizes. Drinks are expensive ($4.10 or so for a can of Coke and $4.00 for a small Evian) but that's Singapore.  My husband and I went twice (2 different locations) during our 3 day Singapore visit and both times it was great
5
My son loved Din Tai Fung very much and we used to take 3 to 4 meals in this restaurant during our holiday in Singapore. The dumpling was delicious and the noodle was good. The vegetable was fresh but there was no variety. You will get the same feeling if you visited this restaurant again and again. It was a good choice for new comer but I was looking for something better. I suggested that the management team should change part of the menu periodically to give some surprise to customer
5
One of the most long queue restaurant in MBS, anytime!Have been here for couple times, despite being busy, always giving the best service in terms of : cleanliness, quick service & excellent customer service.The most recommended menu: chilli crab xiao long bao(only in singapore
5
We had looked at going here a few times. There was always lineups. We decided to go earlier, around 5:30pm and we got in right away. You order off a list they give you that you check off what you want. It was an amazing . Clean organized system to get your food. Only recommendation is to bring your own napkins , as none were offered or at our setting. Other recommendation is the locals can handle a lot more spice than we normally can, so be careful about this. Highly recommend going here for the experience like a local
2
As a lover of Ding Tai Fung I was disappointed with the standard of food and service at this particular venue. Tables remained dirty and the food took forever to come...when it did the famous dumplings were void of flavour and appeared to be undercooked. In addition many items listed on the menu were no longer available and, as the line of people wanting a table increased, the dirty tables inside the venue increased. I would not recommend this particular outlet unless you read that it has improved. For me its a thumbs down and NOT up to the normal standard
2
On the 20/02, hubby and myself went to MBS and decided to have dinner at Ding Tai Fung. The waiting time was not very long,(due to the timing I guess) only waited for about 15 mins.We have noticed that this branch have to order and pay for the tea(SGD1) while the other branches, like Tampines branch, which we patrolled the most will automatically serve you the tea upon seated without any charges...After ordered our food, about 15 mins later, a server served me a bowl of plain rice (which we have ordered to eat with the other dishes) without the rest of the dishes... after 15 mins later, hubby asked another server to keep back the plain rice as the other dishes have not being served and the rice is getting cold, hubby told the server to serve the rice together with the dishes instead. The first dish finally being served after 45 mins of waiting.... Some other customers who were seated/came in after us have been served much earlier than us... We had only ordered a bowl of beef noodle soup, a plate of kai lan vegetable, a plate of prawn fritters and a bowl of white rice... After the dishes has been served, the forgot my plain rice, hence hubby asked the server for it and he replied that according to the order form, the rice have been served... We explained to him that the rice was took back earlier while waiting for the dishes to be served. The server walked away without coming back to serve me my rice... he was seen doing other stuff like serving, clearing plates and etc instead.. After 5 mins, we ordered my rice again from a supervisor, without any questions ask, he immediately ordered his staff to serve me my rice. We have noticed that not only the tea is chargeable(different from other branches), there were some dishes also not featured at other branches, hence out of curiosity, hubby asked the cashier are all the branches have different dishes/menu? She replied that all are the same..... except here has additional teas selection and 2 additional dishes. Hubby and I looked at each other and walked away... How can "all are the same, but except...." If there are slight differences than it's not the same already isn't? Even the tea chargeable at this branch also different already isn't it? Anyway it took us so long to dine there, we don't bother to debate with the cashier but walked away instead... -Not only the service was slow (45 mins to be served with our first dish), -The attentiveness and awareness were lacking(1) how can my rice being served when the dishes took about 30 later to be served? (2) how can the server forgot(I presumed that he had forgot) to serve me my rice after ordered?-Most of the Ding Tai Fung branches staff are very friendly and helpful but not this one.

Once we figured out how the system worked we had a nice dinner. When you arrive, they give you a number and a clipboard with a menu. Numbers are called by being shown on an electronic bulletin board and the clipboard is so you can fill our your order in advance and be ready when you are seated. Maybe if they are not crowded, you go right in, but in the evenings, we always saw a line waiting.A bonus is watching the young chefs making the dumplings. I just which I knew which ones they were making so we could've ordered them. Dumplings are served in bathes of 6 or 10.We were not very hungry and looking for a light meal, so we had wontons, vegetarian dumplings and fried rice with egg. The rice dish was really excellent. the meal was tasty and the experience interesting. Note: They quit seating around 9 PM (weekdays). It was not inexpensive
5
Absolutely delicious (the selections I chose). The sesame bun here was the best one I have ever tasted, would highly recommend anyone who liked chinese buns.
4
Can't help but have at least one trip for dumplings on every trip to Singapore. Din Tai Fung never disappoints. The juicy crab and pork dumplings were on point.
Efficient service and enjoy seeing the dumplings being created in the front window.
5
This serves some really good Taiwanese fair. Their dim sums are amazing. While waiting for a table - as usually there is a queue - one can see they make the dim sums. Very interesting to watch.
5
I would eat here every week once or twice if I lived in Singapore.
One of the best Dim Sum restaurants I've ever had and its a chain!
Much better than T Ping Pong in UK.
5
Popped in here a few times now. It's a branch of the famous chain of Taiwanese steamed dumpling restaurants. We sampled quite a few of the dishes now and have some firm favourites. The Xaiolongbao dumplings are delicious and the truffle and pork dumplings are superb. They also serve super chicken wings and the vegetable dishes are divine. All served as they come and piping hot. Drinks are available with refills on the Jasmin tea. It's very busy at the obvious weekend and evening meal slots but they have an excellent system that means you don't have to wait longer than 10/15 minutes and you can order as you wait. Excellent.

I have been to many Din Tai Fung restaurants outlets in Singapore; Paragon Branch, Chinatown Point, JEM in Jurong East MRT Station, Bedok Mall, Parkway Parade, City Square Mall, Waterway Point in Punggol, Wisma Atrai in Orchard Road, Marina Bay Sands, BreadTalk IHQ in Tai Seng, Raflles City Shopping Centre and Resorts World Sentosa.The best restaurant outlet in my opinion would be in Marina Bay Sands at Basement 2 because of these reasons as follows:-1. This is one of the biggest restaurant Din Tai Fung outlet in Singapore. The seatings are very spacious.2. The dish 'Xiao Long Bao' is simply awesome, delicious and juicy and the 'hot soup' that oozed out from the small, little cute 'Xiao Long Bao' is simply absolute to your taste bud and made you want to try for more.3. The shrimps and eggs fried rice is one of the best dish that the restaurant outlet can offer. The portion is absolutely enough for 2 to 4 persons depending on quantities of the customers' consumption. The rice are soft and the shrimps are very fresh. 4. Alternatively, the noodle with spicy sauce is as good as you can locate anywhere in Singapore (whether restaurants or hotels)5. The 'Double-boiled' steam chicken soup is simply too good to resist the order. the chicken is so tender because of the numbers of hours it takes and spends to cook and boil. Even the chicken bones are crunchy and edible if you like to chew it into pieces even your teeth are sensitive.6. For those who like plain...simply plain enough...the restaurant serves plain noodle with soup or dry.7. the Cod Fillet with Superior sauce is one the best dish as the cod fillet is so fresh and tender that it simply 'melts' after you put into your mouth.8. The desserts; Mango Pudding and Double-boiled Papaya and Snow Fungus with Rock Sugar are just some of the desserts that you can't leave the restaurant without consume them. You can even smell the freshness of the fruits; mango and papaya

This place is great. You can try many different dishes, ranging from vegetables, buns, dumplings, the famous "soup dumplings" aka "Xiao long bao" and a variety of appetizers! The food tastes excellent and I love dipping the food in the ginger / vinegar dip, which you can customize the spiciness yourself! You'll be lucky if you go there and there isn't a long line for a table, which is a testament to the good food! The staff is friendly enough but very focused on running a smooth and quick operation. I have been to this chain in a variety of places in Singapore and always keen to go back and take visitors! Even recommended by locals
5
I have dined at Din Tai Fung in other countries (including the original restaurant in Taiwan) and the experience is consistent with quick efficient service and delicious food. I love the dumplings and the free flow jasmine tea. Definitely worth the short wait if there is a queue outside during peak dining times.
4
This place is definitely a must try when in singapore though waiting time can put you off on the weekends. Soup and dumplings are must try. We also like oriental wantons and egg fried rice. As much as we love the food here we appreciate the way in which these dumplings are prepared,almost surgically. Cleanliness it paramount and the entire kitchen is open for customers to look at. There is one thing that can be further improved is a genuine smile from the serving staff.....it will definitely go a long wa
4
This place was great! be ready for a bit of a wait... However, they give you a menu/order form ahead of time. So when you get seated, you give them the order form and the food starts coming shortly after. We enjoyed everything we ordered but the soup dumplings were out of the park!
5
simply great. We tried several other restaurants in Singapore and Din Tai Fung simply was the best.
꼭 드세요. 싱가폴에서 여기만한 곳이 없어요.
3
Din Tai Fung is generally ok, good dim sum. Not much of service oriented yet always full. They hurry you from the beginning...order fast, eat fast and go concept...
5
Visited here for lunch one day and we liked it.
If you love Dim Sum then you can't go wrong at Din Tai Fung. Every dish was a winner.
5
I love the fact that they give you the waiting time. This is super effective managment. The food is excellent. but you feel that the staff is eager to make you leave as soon as you are done.
5
The best fresh dim sums from an open kitchen. Soft & succulent. A long choice
Chinese greens. Priced reasonably. Good for families
5
We came here for lunch and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. The restaurant staff were friendly and helpful and the food was delicious.
4
Their prawn fried rice should also be tried as they r tasty as well... Great food and a low price...
5
This place offers the most delicious soup dumplings ever. Structurally impeccable, light & with the jasmine tea that they served along, we could work our way through 3 steamerfuls. Din Tai Fung's dumplings were assembled in full view of their consumers in a live kitchen. The way it's done is a work of art indeed ! P.S. Take reservations before visiting, this place is always packed !
5
Great choice of food which arrives as it is made! Fresh dumplings....try the pork and vegetable. The place is clean. You can watch the dumpling being made. Price is decent. For 4 people, the cost was SGD 80 with no drinks. The menu is quite extensive
5
The queue is long and i patiently waited for my turn. I was actually waiting for a friend but she was late. I was not accommodated when my turn came as my friend is not yet around..when we are finally ready, the seats are still available for us. Maybe they just want the dining not to be so busy if i am not yet ready to order. The food is great as usual. This is my 2nd time to dine here. I dont usually dine in din tai fung cos of the long queue. The food is great so its worth the wait!!!
5
Din Tai Fung at Marina Bay Sands Shoppes is our first port of call when passing through Singapore. The meal was excellent as usual. Do not miss the Xiao Long Bao!
5
This is a franchise but one with a standard in providing authentic Taiwanese Dim Sum. Go in a group so you can experience everything you'd like and more. Be a little adventurous and you'll be handsomely rewarded.
5
At first, I came for dinner at about 7 pm on New Year's eve and the wait was 80 minutes!!! Bad bad idea coming here on a holiday, so we decided to give up.Having learned our lesson, we visit on another day a few hours earlier than dinner time and we immediately get a seat. The order and the dishes also came smoothly without any wait at all. Around 7pm the wait was around 20 minutes, so I get what the other reviews were talking about. If you hate waiting, you can come earlier than lunch/dinner time like us and you'll enjoy a great service and great food without any wait.What we ordered2 of the dim sum menus: delicious as we had expectedChicken broth soup: the broth was fantastic!A wonton side dish: I'll definitely order another one next time!!Water: Yes, you have to pay for cold water, but the refill is free. Staff will come offering water refill often.Definitely want to eat there again next time
3
After waiting 25 mins to get in (which always adds to the hype) we then sat down and waited another 20 mins for water and tea to turn up. There were no condiments on the table (thank you to the solo lady diner next to us). I waited another 5-10 mins for a top up. Tap water cost money and a beer was $11. The dumplings were good but not "incredible"!Maybe I missed something, maybe we just had a bad experience. I'm not sure but I do know I'm not rushing back
5
We always order the pork dumplings, spinach and garlic and the seaweed and bean curd salad. The raw ginger that is served is the perfect flavoring for the soy sauce mix that is provided. Don't be afraid that you won't know how to eat them. Just watch your neighbor. We eat at this chain every time we are in Asia
5
I have visited Din Tai Fun regularly over the last few years, both in Singapore and in Sydney where I live. We waited for a table for about 30 minutes, but it was very busy on a Sunday so the turn around was relatively quick considering. Despite being so busy we had a lovely man refill our tea every 5-10 minutes, which was great! The food was of a high standard and it had all our Din Tai Fun favourites. Definitely recommended
3
We stayed for some days in Singapore and twice we tried to go to Din Tai Fung in Marina Bay. We have tried several branches in Asia and so this is an easy choice to bring the kids.We waited for more than an hour (although we expected 40 minutes according to the board) and I was very disappointed when we finally got a table to see how disorganised the operation was. The free tables took forever to clear and so it wouldn't be surprising to find so long queue.The food is similar to other branches - as expected, I particularly like the pork steamed dumplings which are famous with all the family.Staff, probably because the operation is not so well organised, come across as less polite since they are always running around.If you intend to go I suggest you get a number in the queue and visit the mall or even the museum and come back in an hour to have your meal without waiting. With kids it might be challenging.I believe this chain is good value for money but in this particular case the waiting and lack of proper operations is a throw off..
5
Best xiao long bao we ever tasted. Even if there is quite long Q to eat there, but somehow it is worth it. We love their noodle too, the texture is very soft and the soup is very tasty. Price is quite expensive but since the restaurant have quality, i rated five star for the taste and service
4
We've been here for so many times and the food is always consistently great.All of the steamed dumpling varieties are very delicious with hot soup oozing into your mouth in one bite.Be aware that usually there is a 20 - 40 minutes waiting time, so be there early
3
Came here for early dinner. This is a popular restaurant so need to take queue no.The Sweet n Sour Pork was average but the pan fried prawn pancake was nice.Service was average and what I didn't like was the way the senior server refilled my tea. He looked away half way while pouring the hot tea into my cup and some of the tea got splashed onto the table. He could have splashed it on me if I had placed my hand on the table them. They got to be careful! Moreover, he is a senior server not some trainee.
4
Fun place to eat great dumplings. Lots to choose from in bustling restaurant.
The mix of patrons and the queues to get in show how popular this place is. It is well worth it.
Try the chocolate dumplings!
4
I was recommended this by a restaurateur who was on the plane to Singapore. It was a great recommendation. Be careful the dumplings are very hot. Make sure you try the pork and truffle ones – they are amazing.
5
Tried these delicious dishes and it's all worth it. I went here with my cousins and everything is all worth it. It's one of the most queued food store in Marina Bay Sands.
4
A very busy metropolitan restaurant serving authentic well cooked food at 2 Bayfront Avenue.
I was there with my son, his fiancée and my four year old granddaughter, we all ate extremely well for 161 Singapore dollars and the service was exemplary.
5
It doesn't look like much but it's truly epic flavor makes any wait worth while. Try as many dishes and dumplings as you can! I was adventurous and it paid off! The exploding dumplings were the best by far!
3
This place is a must if you are in the area. You get what you go there for. Great Chinese food, and especially Xiao long bao. But poor service and long waiting time to be expected. Last, bill can go up quite fast.
5
There are several branches of Din Tai Fung. I usually visit the Paragon or Marina Bay Sands. No matter which one you choose, if you come at peak time you are likely to wait 20 min or more for a table. They don't take reservations. Every minute of the wait is worth it. Get ready to eat the best dim sum. They are even in the Guide Michelin. Besides all the dumplings, the dry noodle with spicy sauce is fantastic. This is the favorite place of my family any day of the week.
5
There are so many great dishes to choose from at DTF. The spicy original wontons were excellent, as were the dumplings and all the different types of vegetables.Service here was good, although for Singapore standards they close early at 10pm and take last orders at 9.30pm.Surprised they charged for water and for the towels but the food is worth it 
5
In 2014 I was walking by and saw the line for this place and knew it had to be good. We tried it and eat here every time we are in Singapore. Its fun to watch the cooks make the dim sum. They are so fast and make thousands everyday. Everything on the menu is great. Be prepared to wait because they are always busy. But do keep in mind it is worth waiting. Put your name down and stand by they do not take reservations
5
Have eaten at Din Tai Fung in many countries and this is the first time for the one here at Marina Bay Sands, Singapore. A favourite dumpling - Black Truffle Xiao Long Bao - is served here (not available in all countries).Taste and price consistent with other Din Tai Fung around the world.
4
This is good local food, although slightly more expensive than expected.
We ordered a number of dishes - the best of which was soup dumplings.
Would recommend stopping in for lunch.
5
It's my second time here in Singapore and as always, I can't go here without eating at Din Tai Fung. Xiao long bao is the bomb. It's my favorite.
5
30 SGD for ä lemongrass drink (way to sweet for my taste), oriental salad, spicy noodles, and obviously pork dumplings. The latter was terrific!!!
5
This is very popular lunch place with good food.Reasonable price. Very good dim sum and prawns pancakes.
2
Went to this din Tai Fung restaurant in marina bay for a Sunday lunch. Was told 15min to wait - actually waited 40 min. Once seated the service was poor with even the pre-prepared dishes taking significant time to come out. Will not be visiting this branch again.
4
If you're into dumplings, don't miss DTF. I discovered this late, after going to a different resto many times over. Recommended dumpling is their specialty: xiao long bao - vegetarian, shrimp & pork, and chicken varieties. Better eat it within 5 minutes of serving, as it is best to experience the explosion of hot soup in your mouth as you enjoy every piece in the steamer. Other notable items are fried vegetarian dumplings, fried rice with egg and hot & sour soup. End your meal with mango pudding and hot tea. This is a guaranteed highlight
3
This Din Tai Fung was not as good as the two I visited in Shanghai / Pudong, but was better than the one in LA. You are most likely going to wait in line but they are good at moving things along. The food is fresh but not as delicate as the food in their Shanghai branches. Not especially cheap but compared what you are going to pay in the rest of the Marina Bay Sands complex, it's probably one of the more reasonably priced places
5
Terrific dumplings and dim sum. Ordering is simple. Just check the box on the order form and the waitress returns with the food. Convenient, easy and takes the mystery out of ordering if one is unfamiliar with the food. Nice description on the menu of what the food might be
5
Having scoffed the buns and dumplings at a DTF in Hong Kong, we had to go in Singapore too. We weren't disappointed - simply delicious with a great selection of side dishes, the pork-mince-stuffed chili peppers were a particular delight.Be prepared to wait though, there is always a queue for a seat. Grab a ticket to secure your place in line, then wander round the mall for half an hour to kill the time.Top tip - beer's a bit pricey (as it it most places in Singapore) but the bottomless Jasmine tea is only a dollar or two per person.Turns there are 21 DTF locations in Singapore - we've got a lot more scoffing to do
4
This was a great place to eat. Very clinical and clean. The food was so fresh. All the dumplings was home made. You received top ups of green tea. We had the spicy noodles which were freshly made noodles. The best I have had in Singapore and then the pork and crab dumplings. The pork buns are great. Not too sweet. While you wait they hand you menus that you can commence your order. I personally would rather wait to be seated and enjoy to select at leisure the choice of the menu but the staff are keen to push the people through. The food is excellent. The staff are great. Just a little rushed.
5
I have had a amazing lunch by myself but was worthy of every month full
Yum and yum
I will visit them in every city I will find them
Highly recommended
The truffle dumpling along .......!!!!
5
When you finished to queue (we had to wait around 30 min), you will enjoy maybe the best Dim Sum and dumplings you ever had ! I also have been on the same restaurant in Hong Kong and you're never disappointed !
4
It is good fast food Chinese style. It is quite reasonable with prices and tastes very good, but don't forget is is "fast food" so do not expect too much.
4
Din Tai Fung are a taiwanese chain thta has expanded throughout SE Asia. Several of their eateries have won michellin stars and eating there, it isnt hard to see why.There are 4-5 brances in Singapore and the Marina Bay sands outlet is probably the most popular. When we arrived there was an average wait time of 45 minutes... They operate a system of allocating waiting diners a number and then you wait.Turns out the wait was worth it. Their Xiao Long Bao (steamed soup dumplings) are exquisite as were the other dishes ordered.If the food is great, The service is middling. Annoying habits such as placing the bill on the table before we'd even started eating, not ensuring that the right condiments were on the table etc all niggled.The other grip is their prices - given the chain like nature of Din Tai Fung, the meal prices seemed a tad steep. Charging for drinking water is also not a good look.That said, Din Tai Fung should be on the list of anyone visiting SE Asia, their food is too good too miss out on
4
Din Tai Fung in Bangkok was an awesome experience and hence when we passed by the restaurant at the Marina Bay Sands we immediately knew we wanted dinner here.There was a waiting for an hour . Once our turn came we got our food quickly . The order was for egg fried rice, chicken dumplings some greens . The food as usual was good and consistent in taste . There is not much to speak about the service as you don't expect much service in places like this.Good experience overall,will go back when the craving is for dim sums
4
This is a famous and very popular dumpling and handmade noodle chain across Asia that's originated from Taiwan. The food is consistently good in every branch. The Marina Bay Sands branch is new and incredibly busy. Best make a reservation if you're set on coming here for dinner, especially on a weekend
5
We had to wait for 50 minutes because the cue was quite long. But everything we ordered was delicious. We ended up ordering too many dishes and had to pack some for home. We ordered xiaolongbao, siu mais, spicy hot and sour soups, spicy noodle, etc. and there were all very tasty. Did not eat dinner afterwards that day because we were so stuffed! (we started eating around 2.30 and finished around 3.30pm
5
Dumplings do not get any better than this, I can promise you. The food here is delectable and the delicious dumplings are unlike any I have ever tasted. The appetisers are also just as good, and the various mouthwatering rice and noodle dishes are just as tasty as the picture looks. The atmosphere is very light, and the staff are good-natured and polite. Promising a 40-minute wait at times, with the long queue and many patrons, the food comes in 20 minutes, which is amazing! Sure, the price may be a little steep, but for food like this, it is worth every cent a thousand times over
5
The restaurant is making at the moment the dumplings you are choosing . You can see it from the large glass windows showing brilliant cookers making dumplings and then cooking them.It is a spectacle only to see them preparing. And the taste is also great .. Worth to try ..
5
I very much enjoyed my experience at Din Tai Fung. The service was good, the prices were reasonable and the food was amazing. Although I was warned by the hostess that it takes ~40 mins for dumplings to arrive, I got my dish only after ~15 mins (quicker than most standard restaurants). The place wasn't that crowded as well as I came at ~15:00. All in all, a great place with great food at a reasonable price. Don't forget to ask for the black sesame filled dumplings as they are out of this world - reminds me of HALVA that I so enjoy eating..
5
Very popular but worth queuing for a very good selection of dumplings and noodles. All freshly made. Very efficient service !
Tip; if there is a queue, fill in your choice and by the time you'll be seated, food is coming
4
The restaurant has huge variety of food I took dim sum yummy food and noodles the food is nice at good price would recommend to the average person it's popular with long queue
4
Din Tai Fung is a famous brand in dining industry in Singapore. Its Siao Long Bao is the famous dish there not to be missed and the food quality is assured.
You can find this branded outlets in most big shopping complexes.
5
What's there to say? Dumplings do not get any better than this. For those that are not convinced of the premium value of Din Tai Fung over "regular" dumplings, do the test and check out the dumplings in the Food Court 100 meters further in the shopping mall. I promise: once you go Din Tai Fung, you will not go back
1
This was without a doubt my worst DTF experience ever. First I had to wait for a table for 15 minutes, but I get that, if its good its busy. I ordered the braised beef soup and pork dumplings. The soup was awfull, disgusting fatty tough meat and watter with not much taste. Its one of my favorite dished and I always have it wherever I go. This was so dissappointing. I returned it and asked for more dumplings instead. It took them 20 mintes and when I asked, they said it will take 10 more. That was the icing! I payed for my lousy 6 pork dumlings (they did't even bother to offer them for free!) that cost me 1,5 hour of my one day in Singapore and was out of there. Im never coming back
4
I love Din Tai Fung! It's a really good Chinese restaurant. Usually the line could get long but if you are not in a hurry I would say it's worth the wait. They are pretty organized too. As you are seated, you are given a form and you put in your order. It's like a menu and you just write how many orders per dish. After eating, you bring the paper and you pay at the entrance.
4
During stay at nearby Marina Bay Sands Hotel, observed this place several times before dining here. Observation was that the wait to be seated often exceeded 45 minutes. As a result, tried dining in late morning - no wait! Food was delicious, particular the dumplings and steamed buns. Soup was also very good. Tried several of the chef's recommendations listed on the menu - all satisfied. Explains why this restaurant is successful all over Asia. Prices quite reasonable for this neighborhood. Service could be faster. Window into part of kitchen enables observation of dumpling production
5
Din Tai Fung in MSB is great place to go for lunch or dinner and experience typical Asian food in its perfection. No doubt chain has Michelin start. Very nice, good selection meat or veg, freshly prepared for guests. During peak hours some waiting prior entering place is possible
4
There are many Din Tai Fung and the standard is quite consistent. The thing to always order is their Xiao Long Bao or meat dumpling. It must be handled carefully so that the skin does not break and the juice inside is lost. It should be eaten with a bit of ginger with black sauce. yummy
3
Having eaten at a few of these restaurants around Asia I find the variety of Xiao long bao here very good but that’s about it. The service is really slack, the young man delivering the dumplings was very attentive and polite but the girls from the wait staff were useless, we had to ask 3 times for a glass of water, the first time we asked for ice water and that was a mission so we just asked for water and it’s like they are talking into the microphones and delegating to someone else but not following up to see if it’s being done. I thought that as it was very hot and we were told that it would take about 20 minutes for the food to start coming out the young girls would have seized the opportunity to sell drinks but nobody bothered, I suppose they’re not familiar with add on sales. Why worry about it we’re busy enough? How sad. The food was very tasty and delicious but I don’t think I’ll bother with this place again
4
A meal for all the family. The range of dumplings is great and the speed of service is great if you don't want to hang around
Can feel a bit impersonal and like a production line but food very good
5
I love the DTF restaurants. Have been in Hong Kong, Shanghai and now in Singapore and everytime the food is so delicious. I definitely come back. One point to improve: it was quite cold in the restaurant because of the aircon.
5
This is a lovely Taiwanese restaurant. I remember we went there about 5 times during our first trip to Singapore back in 2013 and we loved their delicious dumplings and not only I read on the first page of the menu Din Tai Fung has been ranked as one of the world's top 10 best restaurants by the New York Timesâœ…
4
Definitely one of the best Xiao Long Baos in Singapore! Do go for the original ones because the rest are not that good.Another good dish is all their mini appetisers like the Xiao Cai, Drunken Chicken and all. Really tasty.Their egg fried rice with pork is magnificent too! A must try when you are there.
5
This is a delicious place to eat and the queues are very long during peak hours. So, best to avoid 12noon - 2pm and 6pm-8pm. My kids love the dumplings, veggies, and the surprisingly good mango pudding. The fried rice, spicy noodle dishes and chicken soup is also very nice. I've eaten at many of the Din Tai Fung restaurants around Singapore and each have been of excellent quality food
5
Din Tai Fung is definitely expensive because the prices for most foods are around $45-60Definitely a lot of tasty foods to eat.They mostly are famous for the dumplings that they make.I would definitely come back here again and eat the same food again and again because all the foods are filling and you don't want to end up spending too much money on itTIP:Buy lessIf you like it come back again and buy don't buy it the second time or you will end up spending more then $10
5
We were luck enough to get a table straight away, by the time we left there was a huge line outside. It wasn't long before we were eating fantastic food, the dumplings were delicious and I usually don't like dumplings. The fact that you can watch them make the food was amazing. This is a must try restaurant if you have the chance, you won't be disappointed.
4
We have been waiting for 30 minutes to be seated. After hearing a lot of good things about Din Tai Fung we tried. Their dumplings the best and the chicken soup too... will definitely be back to try the rest of their items on the menu
5
I had read very positive reviews and some friends said we should go to Din Tai Fung. This is an award winning restaurant and we fell in love with the food. We stayed 2 nights in Singapore and had dinner at Din Tai Fung the 2 nights.The restaurant is a bit busy and you are likely to have to wait a few minutes before getting a table (it is still worth to wait!).While you wait you can select the food you want (paper with menu choices to fill) and once you get the table the service is 5*. Excellent!We thought the food was the best asian/ dim sum we have ever eaten. A must try
2
It was a 50 minute wait to be seated then 30 minute wait for food at 2pm at Marina Bay Sands. I inquired about take away and was told the same wait time by a worker that was rude and it was like I was interrupting her life by speaking to her- Terrible customer service.Disappointing as I wanted to try the dumplings but didn't wait around to find out
4
Tasty dumpling, especially pork dumpling. Little bit expensive but worth to try. Make sure you come early because it always crowded at dinner time.
4
Altough i must wait one hour for got the table but i really satisfy for the taste,services n quality n the price also good. But we must check for the order because the situation very crowded
4
Great food. Steamed dumplings and buns stood out (try pork!). Hot & Sour soup was good but could have done with more spicy. Limited vegetarian options.
4
I didn't like much dim sum until I tried in this restaurant. Popular, very crowded, but good service and great food in general.
4
A lokal friend met us at this restaurant. The dumplings with soup were very good. Especially when dipped in vinegar and ginger. Price was ok.
5
Our friends recommended this place ... we went to 1 in orchid road and then we went to marina bay sand as well. Usually this is the only restaurant u will find que but don't worry u will get table in 15 mins . they have 100's type of dim sums in there menu . No words can describe the Food .....was Delicious !!

I went to Din Tai Fung in Shanghai back in 2010- and it was a phenomenal experience. I was excited to see they had a Din Tai Fung in Singapore so I was hoping to recapture some of that experience from 2010.It couldn't have been more opposite. It appears that DTF has taken cues from the fast food chain industry. DTF is now just a quick-eat joint with a couple of xiao long bao on the menu- not the extensive, interesting, rotating options that were available in Shanghai.Food was just ok- again, more like a quick-eat chain than something to seek out. I hope the original location has retained it's magic, and if it has, it is worth the trip there. For the "outlets"... I'd skip them

Good Food = Busy Restaurant, but not necessarily great experience! We did not have to wait for a table as we arrived before the lunch rush has started. The restaurant was already quite busy. We ordered our food and waited for a while. Dumplings arrived first followed by noodles with spicy sauce and pork chop. They were all very tasty. We thought that they forgot about the drunken chicken we have ordered as well, and were going to leave when it suddenly arrived. It was not worth waiting for, especially eating it on its own. I must admit that the noodles and the pork chop were amazing! For 4 dishes, tea and water we paid S$54.61, rather expensive for the amount of food we got
4
The selection of food is impressive! The waiting time for a table was quite long but once seated the service was fast and efficient. All different food we tased was good and tasty from not spicy to very hot. The ambiance is a little like a mass cantine but the service was friendly. I went back a second time the same week as I liked the restauran

You can tell just how popular a place is by how long the lines are at lunch & dinner times and here the lines snake out the door and wind their way outside the adjoining shops.Even if you have to wait, you're handed a menu from which you can pre-order to speed up the process, once seated, and once you are the food starts to arrive at a brisk pace.I've eaten at a number of branches in Australia, but they pale in comparison to the Singapore versions where the menus are larger and more varied.Try the prawn paste chicken wings, simply delicious and a must have are the prawn pancakes.Choose whatever dumplings take your fancy, they're all excellent and we've never been let down on our numerous visits.The prices aren't unreasonable and you're sure to leave full.For reliable, tasty food with fast, no frills service, you can't go wrong with Din Tai Fung
5
Very authentic Asian Dim Sum...loved everything we ordered and went back 3 times in the 5 days we stayed in Singapore. Highly recommend for some yummy Asian food.
5
Love dumplings and you'll love this like the Singaporeans. Very busy and can even be a waiting period to get a seat - but worth the wait. As they make the dumplings near the front of the restaurant, wait and watch them getting made.
4
No matter which outlets you visit, there is always a queue.
However the food was nice and worth to try it.
5
The food here is brilliant and the best food I ever had ! My favourites were the dim sums and soup although all items were awesome. There was a long waiting time but totally worth it.
5
Seriously the best dim sums I've ever had! We had to wait about 20 minutes for s table but were def not disappointed. The staff were excellent, so helpful and attentive. If you have the time I'd recommend stopping here.
5
Din Tai Fung is one of my favourite fast casual places; the food is great, the service is fast and easy, the price is reasonable. Hard to think of a reason not to go more often.
2
The food is the usual (I've eaten at Din Tai Fung in many of their branches throughout Asia) but with the understandable crowds, the branch at MBS goes down to a level of service that thankfully you won't experience in other branches. No standard hot tea with the food as in other branches, rude mainland Chinese staff, as noisy as a henhouse.... Better stay away, I know I shall.
5
My wife and I ate here in June whilst visiting Singapore. There is always a queue as the food is so good, we ordered the fried rice and deep fried pork chop which was absolutely fantastic.If you're looking for fine dinning and top end service this is not for you, but if you want quality good local food, you this place can't beat. I would go again and again
4
I wanted to eat a good Dim Sam and following reviews I read on TripAdvisor I decided to checkout Din Tai Fung.The place is at the lower level of the Marina Bay Sands mall.They offer a very nice selection of Dim Sam and other dishes, the prices is also good and I was able to taste different dishes for only $35.It is not a place for a romantic dinner or anything like that but a great stop away from the hot humid weather in Singapore. Enjo
5
When I think about it, I would have never imagined eating only dim sums for dinner. But, honestly, all the dim sums at Din Tai Fung are good and there is so much choice that one does not need anything else.They even offer dim sum for dessert! The service is fast and the price is fair, especially when you compare it to the prices of the other places in the mall.Just one bad thing: you'll need to wait to go in... quite a lot, actually, and that's annoying..
5
My favourite place in Singapore - visit every time I can get there. Excellent, fresh food. Amazing dim sum all made fresh. You can watch the chefs making the food. Large menu selection and great pricing. Staff were really friendly and quick service.
4
You can't go wrong, it's standard, Chinese fast food, super consistent across the world. 101, 201 and 401 are musts.
5
I was recently in Singapore for work and was on the lookout for an easy place to eat after work. Din Tai Fung hit the spot, and they even have great options for vegetarians! I went back night after night. Particularly loved the vegetarian dumplings!
4
Delicious dim sum. No-frills restaurant in a shopping mall. Dim sum is excellent. Large selection and everything we tried was delicious. Would definitely go back, though more for lunch than for dinner.
5
If you like dumplings this is your place! Pork, pork and crab, truffle and pork. Eat them all. Its best to go with a group as well to maximize your variety. Also what I found surprisingly good was their hot and sour soup.
5
Excellent choice for dimsum. Oh yeah this place has a Michelin star. There is always a line but it moves pretty quick.
4
Very efficient staff, good food and a pretty busy and noisy atmosphere, however, not bad for a weekend lunch at the mall. Hot and sour soup was delicious too.
3
The title says it all really. This restaurant has a good name and a good reputation, that wasn't marred by this particular outlet.The xiao long bao was as tasty and soupy as ever, and the pork chop fried rice was as to be expected. Expensive for the price, you don't come into this place expecting cheap eats in the first place
5
What a secret gem. I had been hunting for good dim sum, especially xiao long bao. Well not only does this place have a Michelin Star, but they are well priced, super fast & hit the spot.Everything here is good, make sure to get a nice selection.Good for small groups as you then can try more items
4
We ended up wanting to go into this restaurant because the place always had a massive queue outside every night - and the best advert for it was that the vast majority of the people queuing were oriental - always a good sign for a Chinese restaurant.We therefore got our ticket and managed to get seated about 20 minutes later.Because it was busy you were encouraged to select your meal before actually being seated which was a great idea plus it let you have a bit of time to look closely at the menu. Food was very good and completely different from Chinese restaurant food back in the UK. The atmosphere was lively and service quite swift considering the numbers of people in there. Top tip - have the Jasmine tea with your meal as it is cheap and refills are free. Price wise I thought it was ok considering the restaurant is in a shopping mall - cost us 80 Singapore dollars but we had a lot of food. I would definitely recommend and would return if I retuned to Singapore and found myself in the Marina Bay Sands shopping mall
5
Consistently a fabulous place for lunch or dinner.
Staff are efficient, thoughtful, and deliver the food as it is ready.
Love the egg rice, chicken dumplings, garlic spinach, and pork buns.
5
I have been to many Chinese restaurants to try their Xiao Long Bao but not many has what Ding Tai Feng offers. It is juicy, succulent and the skin thickness is just nice. This restaurant never fail to satisfy my cravings.
4
I definitely recommend this place. Food is good, in my opinion any dumplings will make you happy! The service was good.
5
We visited after trying the Taipei branch and were pleased that we did.
The food was delicious, the service quick and efficient and the overall experience was enjoyable.
We would go back again.
4
Most of the Din Tai Fung outlets require some queuing. The turnaround is rather fast. Getting there during off peak might work better especially at this outlet where crowd descends at 1130am to 2pm, and again from 6pm to 8pm.
5
We arrived around 5:45/6 and were seated right away. That they had highchairs, which a lot of restaurants in Singapore do not. They also had plastic plate, cups, and forks for the kids. We had a sampling of primarily vegetarian and buns, dumplings, fried rice, and vegetables. Everything tastes really fresh and clean. The dumplings were particularly great, the wrapping was super thin and absolutely beautiful. Highly recommend vegetarian steamed buns, dumplings, and the sautÃ©ed pea shoots. only downside was my husband thought the menu choice was somewhat limited. Also you need to get there early otherwise there is a line
2
Food is really good and I especially like the pork chop rice and dumplings of courseBut the staff from reception to waiters are really rude and do not speak in English. Considering they are located in a touristy area they should at least acknowledge the customer and speak in english.Our order have not arrived yet but we were asked to settle our bill as they will close soon. In a rude way of askin
5
I have never been a fan of Chinese food until Din Tai Fung showed me what it can be when done masterfully. Their Xiao Long Bao (steamed pork buns) are delicate bite-sized masterpieces. (All other "dim sum" pales in comparison to the magic that happens at Din Tai Fung.) Stuffed with meat so tender, a wrapper so thin and a pocket of delicate broth so perfectly balanced, it simply melts in your mouth. My kids (also not normally fans of Chinese food) fight over these steamed dumplings counting "how many have you had?" to make sure the distribution is fair. Try one of the many fresh drinks with the frozen ice ball made of the same ingredients as your drink so it doesn't get diluted as the ice melts (a nice touch). They even have options for vegetarians. The steamed vegetarian bun and dumplings have a very flavorful mix. And don't forget to buy their famous pineapple cakes (actually pies) before leaving. Their kitchen is enclosed in glass so you will find yourself riveted by the action, speed, precision of making the dumplings by hand. And they do not accept reservations. Because they are just that good, there is usually a line to get in, but they move it quickly and give you a paper menu to decide on your selections at the giant menus by the entrance so you are ready to provide your order as soon as you sit down. Get ready for fast service, Michelin star (they've really got one!) quality food and an experience that will leave you dreaming about these flavors and disappointed if you ever how Xiao Long Bao somewhere else
5
I have been to Din Tai Fung at MBS so many times with my family. Their food comes up to the same standard every time we have eaten there. It's amazing how they manage to deliver the same taste day after day. I believe Din Tai Fung should be a model for restaurants
4
My husband took me here to sample Chinese food (the only cuisine I don't like) and can say this is the best Chinese food I have ever had. Approachable for someone who doesn't like Chinese food and enjoyable for my husband who LOVES it. There were families, couples, fathers and daughters as well as business people all in the one place enjoying a great lunch or dinner with fast service.Well priced as well. I would return, and that's a big deal!
5
We have eaten here a few times and is Great value for money in a expensive food area if you dont drink.. Alcohol in Singapore is insane.
The chilli Dumplings are fantastic... must try
4
if you are hungry during shopping, this is one of my choice. Din Tai Fong is very good place for having meal they have rice, noodle also dim sum. The price is kind of high but if compare with quality is totally fine but one thing is there's so many queue you may have to wait for a whil
5
We arrived hungry at 10;30 am to avoid the long lines and were not disappointed. We were blown away by the flavors and textures! We had 2 kinds of their famous soup dumplings they were excellent as expected but it was the prawn cakes and pineapple cakes that surprised us. We are now planning another trip to SG that includes a visit to Din Tai Fung to buy boxes and boxes of the pineapple cakes.tips:- the vegetables are good but save space in your tummy for the dumplings and noodles. save the vegetables for when you are in another restaurant or hawker center.- i cannot say this enough. we noticed people taking away boxes of the pineapple cake so we brought 3 box of 10's. We thought that would be enough.Turns out you can never get enough of the buttery pineapple filled cakes. YUM!
5
We judged this restaurant by how busy it was, and it was a good choice. We had sticky buns with chili crab filling, fried rice and shrimp and pork dumpling soup. The sticky buns were the best ever - nice and fluffy with a tasty, spicy filing. My husband loved the fried rice. It's busy, so there was a wait, but it was worth it. Besides, we weren't bored waiting in such a lively restaurant. I'd return.
5
The taste of Xiao Long Bao is always a delight & revelation and my palate always welcomes it as an enticing treat.The ambiance in MBS does not differ in any other branch because they don't charge extra for it nor does the branch beg to differ from the usual dining set up
3
I don't think you would need to look at forum pages to know that din tai fung goes to great length to make sure that their food is consistent. You would notie by the way they measure each and every steam bun before wrapping it up and serving it to customers. Similar with my most favourite fried rice with fried pork chop. I once ate at i12 and managed to see them cook on the 2nd level (though they are no longer there) precision is key in din tai fung. BUT, one common flaw is that all you need is good food. Being a chain store, its store lacks personality and does not enrapture the whole 'dining experience' that most of us wish to seek. (especially so at the MBS branch
4
We visited this branch after watching the 7.45 pm light and sound show at Gardens By The Bay. We were told the waiting time for a table was 30 minutes, however we were seated in about 20 minutes, which was great because my feet were killing me! Your number will be shown lit up on a screen over the doorway when it's your turn.There were two of us and we chose 6 Xia Long Bao dumplings, a pork cutlet and fried rice dish, one pork bun, a plate of spinach with garlic, a glass of table water and a watermelon juice. We loved the pork cutlet and fried rice, however didn't really enjoy the dumplings. In saying that though, I don't think you can take it as a reflection of the quality, but instead the fact that perhaps we're not used to that type of food, having not tried dumplings before. It may be an acquired taste.Don't go there expecting hawker centre prices. I knew it wouldn't be cheap, however I was shocked to see that my glass of watermelon juice cost $8 and they charged us $0.50 for a small glass of tap water. Next time I'll pay closer attention to the price of juice when ordering, however I don't think I can really complain at a total cost of just over $50 for two people, particularly as the surroundings are nice and comfortable.The service was efficient and they did come around and ask if there was anything else we wanted to order as they were closing the kitchen. They then presented us with our bill at the table and said that it was very close to closing time. I have no problem with this as they must be keen to get home after a long working day.All in all, a new and enjoyable experience and I'll definitely go again when next in Singapore
5
Our first Din Tai Fung and the steamed pork dumplings were everything I'd been lead to believe that they would be. I loved everything about the place, how busy it was, the food, the endless tea, the organisation and sheer hard work on display. Excellent customer service here.
5
This was quite an eating experience and well worth the 30 minute wait.  You must chose your dishes from the incredible menu while you wait in the queue.  Not cheap but not bad for Singapores prime location.We spent $25 per person and were full . You can watch the kitchens from outside and in. Everything we ate was delicious and don't think you could go wrong. Staff and venue were perfect in every way
3
We're regulars here, across a variety of locations. Food is truly fantastic, but with the expansion, a certain similarity could be seen across the 3 x Singapore locations we ate at recently (yes, we like it that much)...Not much to say that others haven't, or that we haven't said previously, but we have noticed the price for 4 pax is what we used to pay for 5, so can only assume a reboot on the prices has occurred. It's still great, but no longer the bargain it was.
4
The service was good but the food was stunning! Had the beef stew, dumpling thing and spicy soup. Great flavour, great spot and really friendly staff. Can't wait to go back.
5
Tried it back in taiwan and was merely satisfied. this branch in singapore is much tastier. there was a short line during lunch but we were shown to our seats within the next 15 mins. the service level is high. will be back.
4
Loved this dim sum. Even though it was a saturday, we only waited five minutes for a table of three. Fast service and cheap (for Swiss standard). Nice touch by adding in childrens cutlery and bowls. Very child friendly.
5
After coming from the Americas, I can assure you this is amazing compared to ANYTHING there is in USA. Service was amazing and food quality was superb.
4
The only place where I could find some vegetarian dim sum / momos in the city. I ordered a portion consisting of 10 dimsums all for myself and thoroughly enjoyed my lunch.
Simple and delicious food.
4
Din Tai Fung is very famous chinese restaurant in singapore..My parents is very love their foods. The dishes is very delicious like Fried Rice with Pork Chops and Steam Shrimp and Pork Dumplings. The service is good, price is just right considering the excellent quality of the food
4
Cheap and delicious food served fresh off the steamer. The dumplings here are yummy, (the pork ones specially) and will keep you coming back for more. During lunch time it does tend to get a bit crowded and queueing up is necessary however the line moves pretty fast and you don't have to wait for too long. I like it for it's location and convenience. A good spot to grab a meal if you get hungry mid shopping
5
First be patient: there is some waiting, as the food is really excellent. So expect 20-30 min waiting, but worth it.Second, very few foreigners in here, mostly Asian customers who appreciate the genuine dumplings and Dim sum.Very tasty, super clean, cooked in front of you, nice place to eat and chat with friends: I'll definitely come again
5
The food here is fabo, fresh and so tasty and quick, it's worth waiting in line to visit this restaurant, it's always busy, it's family friendly but I often go there on my own and feel perfectly comfortable, the staff are very nice, they keep this restaurant spotlessly clean, I rate it as one of my must do's when I visit Singapore- I do love the dumplings, inparticular prawn and pork but I also love the simple chicken soup and the steamed spinach. Highly recommend a visit to any of the Din Tai Fung restaurants but this one is very nice, has a simple but quality fit out and it's not unusual to spot a few design celebs eating there
4
Be very careful when choosing the time to visit. It can potentially be a very Long wait. We were very lucky to grab an early dinner there. We just had light bites of pork dumplings executed to perfection. It is very intense so if you are not into pork don't bother. Very tourist friendly and reasonably good service despite the crowds. Solid Chinese dumplings also great to try for foreigners
4
Wow ! What an enjoyable food experience. Had dinner here, the four of us shared crab dumplings, shrimp dumpling and fried won tons with pork and shrimp, green vegetables and the best prawn fried rice every. Beers and juice great fast service fresh amazing food.
2
I love DIN TAI FUNG Im a big fan I go every week. But I havd to say, I was really disappointed about the service in MBS they are slow and not friendly at all... Really sad about this experience
5
Favourite xiao long bao. Timeless taste of real Chinese cuisine. Come here at non-peak times to enjoy less waiting time for your table. My favourite is the century egg and steamed yam bun.
4
Always enjoy the food here and similar experience to the other outlets.
My usual fave dishes are the salad with vinegar, xiao long bao, dumplings in vinegar and chilli, fried rice with pork, garlic spinach and pork rib soup.
5
This place is a low key cafeteria style dumpling restaurant and the food is delicious. My personal favorites were the chicken dumplings and the spicy wontons. A must if you find yourself in Asia.
5
I love eating at Din Tai Fung whenever I'm visiting a city that has one. I'm obsessed with the locations in Asia because they all add their local twist and ingredients so no location is exactly the same. I'm vegan so I love that there are so many vegetarian options and I ordered way too much because I wanted to enjoy everything. My favorite items are the garlic pea shoots, the vegetarian dumplings and the red bean and the purple yam steamed buns. I also bought their SG50 anniversary magnets to remember my trip
5
Went to Din Tai Fung during my stay in Marina Bay Sands. All I have to say is, WOW! So delicious! Even though it was busy, it only took them 15 minutes to get me a table and the service was efficient. Food is AMAZING! definitely will be returning
5
The waiting time was around 30 mintues on a saturday evening but it was worth the wait.The food was really out of this world and the ambience and the staff made it that much more memorable.Recommended for all who love Momos/ Dimsums/ Dumplings !!! and then you will realise what's the real ones like ..
5
Stopped into Din Tai Fung whilst out shopping for a late lunch...the restaurant was pretty busy but the staff were very prompt in seating us & taking our order. The food was very yummy...especially the fried rice!A casual style restaurant with quality, tasty food. Try the chilli crab & pork steamed bun...delicious!
4
I have had the dishes in Taiwan but how many times I eat, I never get tired of them. There was a long line and we waited for 30mins. We registered first then the number given has been called in Chinese. We couldn't understand so we needed to ask the staff many times. Anyways the dishes were amazing and I recommend everyone to try.
5
really love this place..they served chinese food..the taste of the food was really good..especially xiao long bao and pork chop.. must try restaurant if you come to marina bay..
5
Service was really average and place very crowded and noisy.
It is a must try place if you wish to taste the local culture.
Food is really good tho and not too expensive.
5
I love eating dumplings at this restaurant, either in Singapore or Sydney are simply the best! Lovely the staff also!
5
Always one of the best place to eat in Singapore.All the dishes are amazing but the best of the best are the truffle "ravioli"!I go there every time we visit Singapore and we never had a bad experience since 10 years of eating there.Simply amazing
3
Went to eat at DTF after years but this time it wast as good as I felt it was during my first visit. The food was not bad but the service wasn't very attentive. We have to call and waited for quite a while before we were served
5
We dined here when we stayed at Marina Bay Sands. The places is very busy at weekends, and operates a ticketed queuing system. However we went on a Monday and it was nice and quiet. The food was delicious and service was great. We loved it so much we made sure we visited their restaurant in Sydney too.
5
Fantastic dumplings with speedy service here. Don't be put off by the queue - it moved quickly. Just go for a walk around and then come back and keep your eye on the counter. The quality and variety of the dumplings - Sui mai, crab roe dumplings, fried rice, kung pao chicken, sweet & sour crispy pork, prawn & scallop dumplings - All YUM. Highly recommende
5
Have loved this chain since trying them in Taipei 5 years ago. Searched them out in Singapore and wasn't disappointed! The dumplings are as good as ever! Watching the employees make the dumpling by hand in the glass-walled room by the entrance, which is a feature of all Din Tai Fung restaurants, was also interesting. Prices are moderate and service reasonably good. Enjoy!
4
We visited Singapore pre and post cruise...Ate at the Marina bay restaurant first and loved it...After the cruise we stayed on Orchard street and ate again at Din Tai Fung in the Wisma Atria Food court ( 4th. floor)The Dumplings are fabulous...The Pork fried rice was very yummy as well..In fact everything ordered was excellent!...The service is efficient and attentive and the prices are so very reasonable ..They have so many branches in Singapore..You get to watch them make the dough .A must for any traveler....Fun place the best dumplings to boot
5
My husband and I were only in Singapore for 4 days but we visited Din Tai Fung a few times as the dumplings are so delicious!I also highly recommend the pork buns.The jasmine tea is very nice, different to what we get at home.It's so awesome being able to see the dumplings being made, the Marina bay sands branch has a really good view of this.
4
Easy-going restaurant, tasty food and nice serving! Maybe hard to find in the big mall. We really enjoyed our dinner.
5
You can't visit Singapore without trying that restaurant . You will have to wait quite a bit to have a table but it worth it ! During that time , watch behind the window , how they cock the dumplings at the moment !!!
5
Those truffle xiao long bao's are just heavenly and that peanut free dish they have now is a must try too. I never fail to order their chicken soup as well.
5
This place is fantastic. We had the pork and chicken dumplings and the stuffed green chilis. The pork dumplings and stuffed chilis are out of this world! This is a must go.
4
If you love dumplings that's your place!
We went for dinner and we love the place, they have a huge chinese food menu including a lot of homemade dumplings.
It really worths to go!
5
We loved the dumpling so much we had them two days in a row. Very popular with locals and tourists and usually have to wait 10 to 15 mins for a table but well worth it. The truffle dumplings were the highlight .
3
There are a lot of Din Tai Fung around in Singapore but taste might be vary. I like their spicy & sour soup, almost everytime to Din Tai Fung i will get that. However, the one I had at MBS is not nice, I have not been to other branch lately, so I am not sure if the standard is drop or only this outlet have the special one. Of course we ordered the famous xiao long bao, I feel it is average but my Russian friend like it a lot
4
I highly recommend eating here despite the rudeness of the staff. The restaurant runs like a machine pumping out orders and delivering systematically to tables. You select what your going to eat on a menu card before sitting down. So I recommend reading some more reviews to get an idea of what you want before you go. Also be prepared for a rude experience with the hostess, just putting down your name in the queue is effort.Despite my negative review of the staff, I highly recommend eating the food. I suggest the pork dumplings and the braised beef noodle soup with brisket.
5
We were taken here by a Singaporean friend and loved the place and the food.Once again, it shows the value of getting a local recommendation.Every dish was delicious and freshly made.The food was mainly gluten free also - an advantage with one celiac in the party.Get there early, as it is popular with the locals
5
Love the food at Din Tai Fung - this branch and others :) my son loves the fried rice, my daughter the xiao long bao and me the dunplings in chili sauce! Always a treat when we are in Singapore. Prices are ok for Singapore standard.
5
Same quality as other Singapore branches but the queue will get very long in few minutes which is mostly tourist.
4
I have eaten in the restaurant chain before and have always found the food to be good, service good and reasonably priced and this place didn't disappoint, highly recommended
5
Awesome place- a must when at Marina Sands! I had the hot and sour soup, shrimp and pork dumplings and yum dumplings and they were delicious!
5
A busy bustling environment, serves to prove its worth. Good fresh authentic food, made to order. Most pleasant. Highly recommended for Dim Sum.
4
This is a chain restaurant . It is good to sit with family . I would like to recommend Pork Dumpling with truffles and pork and vegetable dumplings. Beef soups with or without noodles. Stags are efficient . I don't recommend fried rice . It is very mild taste and very blend. The best dumpling restaurant in the world
3
We have our dinner at Paragons Mall, orchard road. We like the atmosphere & environment there, which same as Taiwan 101 Tower. The food is nice. The service is okay. However, the manager after cleaning the table & pushed away the trolley, it almost pushed away our table. He didn't notice that the bag stand is on the side. It gives us a very bad experience! He apologised to us that he didn't notice.
4
The food in Din Tai Fung is just great! We love the dumplings here. We found the dan dan noodles a bit plain, but pork and vegetable wantons were as tasty as the dumplings. We drank tea with free refills and our cups got filled regularly. The restaurant was quite crowded and the tables are close to each other, so it's not very calm environment to eat in
4
We were immediately drawn to this famous chain once we saw it in The Shoppes close to the Marina Bay Sands casino given we have had outstanding food and service in the Causeway Bay branch in Hong Kong. We had a short wait for a table - around five minutes. That was the opportunity to select our food. In fact we were still selecting dishes when our table was called. Service was very prompt. The food didn't fail to delight us. Their steamed pork dumplings are amazing and must be considered a 'must have' with any meal there. Prawn dumplings were pretty good too. Fresh green vegetables with oyster sauce was another favourite. My only gripe would be that we felt unnecessarily rushed. The restaurant closes at 10.30pm mid week. We arrived around 9.15pm and were told we had to place our last order immediately. We were presented with the bill before we had completely finished our meal with wait staff cleaning tables all around us. It was still only 10.15 'ish. They must have been in a rush to get home! One other observation, the prices reflect the location I think. Not outrageous but certainly not comparable with HK
4
This Restaurant allows you to order while in line, when you seat you can have your michelin starred soup dim sum. Honestly the food is good but the decor and service once inside are not that luxurious. Think you can find better dim sum in Hong Kong or shanghai, but this is very decent specially given that it is within a shopping mall. The regular bao is also good to tr
5
We had our lunch here, the queue might be long but it is worth the wait. It is a Chinese restaurant. The service is fast. All the foods taste good. Their specialty is the Xiao Long Bao which is freshly being made, you can watch how it it made. The proper way to eat it is to savor the soup inside
5
Dinning with family is always a good choice. we appreciated the food so much. we had a great time together.
5
The wonton spicy soup is the best.
We had steamed dumplings and wonton spicy soup. The fried rice is also very good.
4
I visited twice just to get the Prawn/Pork gyoza. They were delicious. Fast efficient service - much faster than the other branches in Orchard Rd at Paragon.
4
Having been to various Din Tai Fung restaurants, this chain consistently delivers delicious dim sum. The Marina Bay Sands branch is a busy spot, and it feels like you are being processed (while you wait for your number to be called to sit down, you can start filling out your ordering sheet, so you can hand it over by the time you are seated), all very efficient. They are known for their soup dumplings (broth inside the dumplings), so make sure you order enough of those!
5
If your looking for delicious food , quick service and good ambiance then this is the place . Huge variety to choose from and once dish beats the other . A must try . Price for a meal are around 35 $ for 1 person ( 1 soup , 1 dim sum plate , I small appetizer & a juice 
5
Any Din Tai Fung restaurant you can find is always great! There are plenty in Singapore, in fact most of the shopping centres have one. Whether you are in Sydney or Singapore, the soup dumplings are always magnificent. The only question you need to ask yourself is how many to order!Service is quick, Asian style, no fuss.For $1 SGD you get endless Jasmine tea which is nice to wash down your dumplings. Of course, you can always find a local beer if you feel it's beer o'clock..

Had a lovely dim sum lunch. Menu is extensive and quality is good. Range of dim sums and buns. Jasmine tea with the dim sum really work well. Place is busy and popular which is always a good sign, but means you may have to wait for a table
5
Best fresh huge range of food for all tastes. Service great. Had to wait 3 or 4 minutes for a table but very well managed. Food ordered and delivered well within expectations. Quality was exceptional and taste perfect. One of our party of 3 was vegetarian and there was a good choice and clearly labelled on the menu. Best Asian meal in Singapore since arriving 2 weeks ago. Highly recommended
5
This is the home of the best fim sum, and I came back on a further visit to Singapore. Careful with the crowds... sometimes you have to wait in line for a while. But you can entertain yourself by watching the cooks prepare dim sum through the glass wall that separates the kitchen from the mall. Also, you'll have to wait some 20 minutes or so because all dim sum are prepared on order. But it's worth the wait...Not cheap for dim sum, count on some SGD 50 per person for a full meal excluding alcohol.Staff is efficient, would be great if they smiled a bit more to clients

Visited on my birthday during National Day Weekend and it was busy. Took at least 30m to wait for table. They flash your number on screen and you need to be there to flash number. It remained busy and had to turn people away at closing time.Seems all DTF have varying menu items though core are their dumplings and the fried pork piece. The food definitely did not disappoint, though I wish I had ordered the 12pc pork and shrimp dumplings rather than the 6pc. My only complaint was trying to flag busser to wipe seat next to me as it had soup broth on it. But busser did not notice. The lead attendant bussed tabled amazingly fast to get people in and out. The other servers made regular rounds to ensure those had plenty of cold or hot water, particularly those who ordered hot tea. While there are plenty of food options available in Singapore, for a bit of a splurge, you definitely cannot go wrong with this place, especially if you have others joining you
5
Top choice. Authentic tasty dumplings. Can be very busy and crowded but definitely worth it. The freshest dumplings i have ever tasted. Service was quick and efficient. Waited in a queue to be seated but didn't take very long.
5
Fabulous. Great value. A bit complicated, and always a queue, but well worth the wait. Try it out. The pictures are a great help to the ignorant westerner!
5
The lines tells you that you are about to eat something good! Dam right you will! Dom sum was awesome, highlights to spice crab fillings and pork shop. Service was fast and efficient. Enjoyable experience.
5
I just love their Xiao long bao and steamed yam dessert. Though it's a bit pricy, the taste and ambience make up for it.
3
Seemed very popular with queues outside with 20min wait. You queue up get a number with a menu selection sheet and wait to be called. Interestingly once inside there seemed to be quite a few spare tables available. Food and service good. Xiao Long Bao were excellent as were the steamed buns with chilli crab filling- my favourite. Tip : if you think you might want an extra beer order this up front- makes life easier
4
Ate here twice over the weekend; the food is great. Hits the spot each time. Comes piping hot to the table, and a delicious dumplings await you. Even the most fussiest of eaters, would find something delightful on the menu. Only bug bear - no sparkling water on the menu
5
Insanely good food! Always packed and busy, but the waiting line moves quickly. Too many delicious items to name...the fried crispy shrimp with lychee is too die for. The pineapple juice is fresh squeezed/pressed. All of the servers and food prep staff wear face masks and gloves. Everything is spotless. Loved it so much we ate here again!
5
Din Tai Fung is the best chain for xiaolongbao. We've been to locations in HK, Singapore and Sydney, and the xiaolongbao is consistently good. The dough is thin yet durable. There is a mouthful of savoury (but not oily) broth in each xiaolongbao, and the filling is delicous. Our favourite is the crab meat and pork filling.What sets the Singaporean Din Tai Fung apart from the other locations is the steam bun with chilli crab filling. It is hands-down the best tasting steam bun! There is so much flavour. It was so good we had to order a second one.Also, this location is insanely hygienic. All the servers are wearing hair caps, face masks and long gloves
5
We came here after visiting Gardens by the Bay to explore the Marina Sands shopping mall and to also grab dinner. Its best to go Marina Bay and Gardens by the Bay during the week as the weekends get so busy. Although it was only a Monday evening, Din Tai Fung was packed. Luckily the queues weren't bad as we only waited 15 mins for a table for 2. The waiting staff were very friendly and polite. Drinks arrived within 5 mins and we ordered 2 rounds of the 'Shiu Luong Bao' (pork dumplings) and also 2 bowls of their soupy dumpling noodles. And boy was it worth the wait! Delicious mouthwatering mouthfuls of little delights! It was also great to be able to see the chefs at work making the dumplings in the kitche
5
Monthly visit once, addicted in their xiao long bao and fries rice with pork chop. The queue always very long, but service is fast. First time had this at MBS, the taste not the best that I had in Singapore Ding Tai Feng, the rice too sticky. And the price increased! However cannot help, will still go again next month, love their xiao long bao ♡♡
4
Nice Din Tai Fung shop situated by a canal in the Marina Sand mall. Clean modern functional interior. Dumplings were nice and tasty as usual. Good place for a break in the shopping.
5
Dim sum anyone? This is the place to get your fill! This one of the best places you will ever visit and sets the bar for all others.
4
I just tried the restaurant to see what the long cue is about. I was amazed to see how they prepare the dumplings and got so excited to try a few. Although there's a long wait for the food I was happy with my choices - pork dumplings with truffle, crispy duck and braised beef noodle (best noodle I've ever eaten).Will visit this restaurants again in the future.
5
We were there on a weekend, probably one of the busiest day and have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated. The goo thing is that you get a number and menu and before seated already decided. Lucky for us we were guided by a friend who knew the place and was easy to choose. The shrimp dumplings and coconut covered desert dumplings were absolutely memorable. Place is busy and not exactly "fine dine", but great place to taste dumplings. Best is to order as many as you can then share:). Price not so bad for Singapore standards. Do not be afraid of the cue and dive in
5
My personal favorite, their Xiao Long Bao and Fried rice. Whenever i have craving for these two, i will think of Din Tai Fung. And their Dan Dan Mien is one of my wife favourite. Its worth the wait but i rather drive down earlier to beat the crowd as seeing other enjoying their food is some kind of a torture...
5
Din Tai Fung is THE Place is you want to have dumplings. Try the crab and shrimp dumplings which are a speciality. The restaurant isn't that expensive, but not a good idea to pay it a visit if you're on a tight budget. Nevertheless, a lovely gourmet experience.
5
If you visit Singapore you have to eat here. Fresh made dumplings in a variety of flavors. Their specialty is the pork. It's a busy restaurant and you may have to wait but it's worth it. Great fresh made food in a casual atmosphere. Price is also not too bad either
5
Once again we loved this place. I have no idea how people dont like food this good. We only ever eat the Xiao Long Bao's and they are always wonderful. Make sure you are patient as you may have to wait to get in, but its worth it.
4
My experience at the restaurant was as I had expected:A 20 minute wait before being seated, during which we decided what we wanted to order, our order form given to the waiting staff when we were shown to our table and the food arriving quite promptly. We finished our meal in under 45 minutes - our pace being driven by the bustle of the restaurant. We had a good selection of noodles and dim sum dishes to choose from. Each serving was still large enough to share between 2 persons. Maybe I had to manage my expectation but I felt that house's special, the xiao long bao, was starting to lose its magic for me
4
Went there for dinner after a workshop with my fiancÃ©e, it's in MBS so you need to expect a queue to get in. You can read the menu while waiting.Waited for 10-15mins, and finally out turn, pass our order to the reception then head to our table.Another 10mins our food started to serve. It's very crowded but good service still provided
5
One of the best food experiences I've had in my life! I got to taste my first Dumplings here and boy did i love it. All the food were amazingly flavourful!
5
I'm here one more time. What to say... it is just amazing. Dumplings are fine and delicious, so is the rice, and the est of the menu pretty much. You don't come for the service, get ready to queue but it's definitely worth a try.
5
DTF world wide is very consistent. Not one if there larger properties, so you have to wait for a table, they take a little longer, but eait is worth it.
3
Din Tai Fung whether it is in Jakarta or Singapore or KL is always good solid Chinese Fare. They have great Dim Sum and other dishes to chose from
4
We will never know what is the secret of Din Tai Fung. They say it is the 18 folds they apply to every single xiaolongbao (dare you to count them) but even their veggies taste awesome. Choose any branch, they all have the same menu!
4
I thought Din Tai Fung would be the same everywhere so when a friend suggested we should eat there, my expectation was a bit low. But the food was really good. Xiaolongbao was really juicy. The service was really prompt and the staffs were really attentive
4
Din Tai Fung, a brilliant international restaurant which I admire for the brilliant system they have on ordering and delivering brilliant food fast, efficiently and effectively.This one in particular though has a very large dining room which is not so modern as the other ones i've been in worldwide. There was a long wait and no where to stand-by except by standing around the door.Food itself once we were in took a long time to arrive and we were ordering their famous dumplings so they should be pumping those things out! Anyway, if you haven't been to a Din Tai Fung better give it a try :
5
Given that there are several Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore, i consider to be this one the best among them in terms of service and atmosphere. The quality of the dishes, especially the dumplings is great and and as good as in any other Din Tai Fung restaurant spread around Southeast Asia. If you really want to go for something special you should try one of the small Dim Sum restaurants in Singapore, but besides you can never go wrong at Din Tai Fung
5
We were staying in Marina Bay Sands and was looking for a restaurant to have dinner. When you see a lot of people queuing a restaurant it must be good. We eventually tried it, went into the que and found it to be worth the wait. The waiting time was not that long because they were kinda quick in calling the numbers. While waiting we were given a menu sheet so we can look and choose in advance. We ordered cucumber salad, 3 kinds of dimsums, 2 noodles and hot teas. Price was reasonable and dumplings were freshly made and delicious. You can actually see them preparing the dimsums from a window. We were full and happy as we left the place
5
We visited the restaurant at 415 pm on a Saturday afternoon; it was a fifty minute wait to get a table. The food was worth the wait! But don't lament the delay because glass windows surrounding the dumpling prep area makes the wait time fly by. It was absolutely fascinating to watch the various chefs create their world famous xiao long bao (dumplings)
4
The dumplings are some of the best around as the Michelin star testifies. Have a side of Stir-fried Kailan (a kale broccoli hybrid). Brilliant for a quick bit and surprising inexpensive.
5
Had a great meal with good service. Very very busy so be sure to get there early if you plan to have lunch. Lots to choose from so we went back a few time. Seriously don't miss this!
4
We started with the soup dumplings which is their specialty. My husband had fish curry soup while I had beef brisket noodle soup. The curry soup was delicious. Mine was just alright. The meal was good enough that we wanted to return.
4
Seriously amazing food. The dumplings are the best I've ever had. Do come early if you want to have dinner though. The place is very crowded. We came at 7 PM and had to wait 30 minutes before there was a table available for us. The food was totally worth waiting for though. Don't take the iced tea; it is way too sweet!
5
Din Tai Fung may be a chain that originated in Taiwan but the focus is on quality and really good, fresh food. The popularity of the place is demonstrated by the fact that there are usually queues but we had no more than 10 minutes on each of the two occasions we went - which may give you an idea about how we liked it - and the time can be profitably spent deciding what to have and marking the dishes off on the ordering slip.The food is freshly made - they have the cooks preparing dumplings in the window - and delicious. If there is one nearby we always try to visit
2
We had to wait in queue long after we were ready to order on the sheet - about 10 minutes. The restaurant was too busy for me but not a lot of other reasonable priced Asian food in the complex so tried this one out. The person on desk was very busy and almost couldn't understand what she was saying as she was on her own. Anyway apart from poor service, dumplings were just okay nothing too good for me though as it was a bit too oily and bland for me. I must say though that your variety of dumplings are a little poor eg. Could include only prawns, duck etc. did not enjoy steamed buns. Didn't get any proper serviettes for those running their noses down from lots of wonderful chillies! Price was a bit overcharged honestly what it was. Should be around $50 for four people ordering quite a number of food. I won't come back here again.
3
We came acrosst his after checking into the Marina Bay Sands hotel. There was a big queue, so we thought we'd give it a go. We were told the waiting time was 10 mins, but this took longer. Walking in, there were many empty tables that weren't yet cleaned. It seems that on average a table takes about 5-10 minutes to get cleaned.Our food arrived hot and was ok. Service is just that, service that is rushed to meet the demands of the high numbers of customers. This is a no thrills restaurant
4
We came here because we loved the Din Tai Fung at the Marina Bay Link Mall. At both locations we had to wait for a table, but only 10-25 minutes and you can already order your food during the waiting time. The service at the Marina Bay Sands is not as nice (not unfriendly though). You have to pay for tea which was free at the Link Mall. The food is really good. We recommend to try the Red Bean Dumplings or Buns (sweet and sooo good!). The Oriental Salad as starter is also recommendable. We ordered different Dumplings and Buns for two and had two tea (which they refill in request and costa just 1$). It was approx 55$ in total and we were more than full! I loved the food at Din Tai Fung and recommend going there.
2
i love din tai fung restaurants in singapore and hong kong.here in marina bay sands was my worst experince so far out of 100 visits in other outlets.food was forgotten and then double charged.also in this special location you need to pay extra for the tea, unlike any other restaurant
5
We visited here in May 2015 for Wifes birthday. Haven eaten at the HK Branch I had the same expectations and was not let down. OK - The queues can build up so whenever you want to eat reach 30 minute before, but remember this is MBS in downtown Singapore. Secondly, haven visited Singapore for last 5 years annually the price for this type of restaurant is accurate. I paid around SG$150 for 4 people, and we had lots of food and to be honest I just kept ordering. Chinese tea is free flowing if you like this. Their Spicy noodles are great and all their Dim Sum is spot on. Go there hungry and spend your cash and you wont think twice. Point to note would be; Singapore being an English speaking country, a few of the staff didn't speak that well. Although not a big issue but this needs to be rectified
5
We ordered the dim sum specifically, the shrim dumpling was great!
Watch out for the hot soup;)
Tasted the pineapple treats but did not like the pasty ness;( in its taste...
Typical din tai Fung place, w/ no line...which is great,
Cheers!
5
Amazing meal! Had the pork dumplings and shrimp empanadas as appetizers. Fried rice and sweet pork as the main course. Absolutely delicious. Good and fast service. Decent price. Highly recommended.
4
Make sure you are happy to line up. lots of choices, great dumplings, great pork options and soups..
3
Chinese Restaurant mainly for the hainanese people, only thing good is they're cooking stlye in the vegetables, they're cooking was up to my standed as for the meat was just so so only.
1
Rude staff! They will rate you by things that u wear or buy.. So when I came In with my hubby n baby son.. They treat us bad! Because they think we just going to spent small money since we are not dress up n not holding any shopping bag from luxurious shop..it Started by always ignorance us everytime we call them and when I want to order fish steam the servant try to warn me that the menu come with expensive price! Omg... But things are turn way around when my teen son n niece come with their Gucci,Bally,Burberry and Hermes shopping bag. They suddenly become nice and always smile at us.. Not recomended
4
My husband and I ate a small dim sum lunch here twice during our stay at Marina Bay Sands. The food was really tasty and was served promptly. Its not a cheap option for dim sum, nor is it fine and polished service (but what do you expect when you have this type of meal?) The food speaks for itself, and I would happily recommend the restaurant to family and friends (and go back myself!). This is a chain restaurant - so keep an eye out for other locations
4
Excellent food, been dying to eat here as it has been over a year since I have been in hong kong. I ordered the dan dan noodles, xiao long baos and the snow pea shoots. Everything was identical to what I was served in Hong Kong. Thanks for a great meal
5
Stayed in Singapore for 4 days and ended up eating here almost everyday. The Dim Sum is super tasty and super fresh and everything we tried was delicious. Often you will have to queue for a table but trust me, it is well worth the wait
4
Children and adults can enjoy the show and watch the cook prepare the dumplings,etc... There was just a bit of wait (victim of their success), service not outstanding but wasn't expecting anything much different.The food is REALLY good, so a good address to go to
5
We eat at one of their branches almost once a week.The dumplings, the vegetables, the starters, the fruit juices, all are consistently great.Starting with century eggs, cucumbers in chilli, grilled pork, tofu and mushrooms and then onto dumplings, bowls and bowls of fresh (not soggy) dumplings. The vegetables are also always perfectly cooked and the fried rice always light and fluffy.I cant fault the restaurant, when they are busy you order in advance while waiting the queue, so when you sit down the food arrives
4
Great tasting Chinese food. Do not go here if you're super hungry because wait period to get seated can be quite long. The restaurant is big and can be understaff so service can be slow at times when requesting for utensils, water, etc.
5
I've eaten at several Din Tai Fungs around the world, yum! Love this place. In addition to the famous soup dumplings, the fried rice and water spinach are also favorites.
4
Located on basement 2, you might have to queue as this restaurant is very popular but serves truly excellent food. The only issue in fact is the service which is truly impersonal but hopefully very efficient. Highly recommended.
4
Din tai fung is a reliable place to go for Chinese food. They always maintain their excellent quality.
Love their prawn and pork xiao long bao.
Don't be surprised by their small portions.
3
It's not better/worse than the other outlets, though it is more expensive (I think everything at Marina Bay Sands is always more expensive, even the food in the Food Court). You're much better off eating somewhere else, to be honest.
5
Best dumplings I can remember plus the steamed pork buns were spectacular. The stuffed green chillis were a big hit as well. The food is very reasonably priced considering you are in MBS. But $11.80 for a small Tiger is just taking the p*ss.
4
After the reviews I read in here I was heading somewhere else for my dinner. However, we just passed by and there was no queue, so we decided to change our plans last minute and try it.Service is quite impersonal, but really efficient. We had an excellent dinner, everything was delicious and would certainly repeat in our next visit to Singapore.I recommend it
5
Was not pleased to wait 25 minutes late on Sunday night but glad I did. Busy dumpling workers in the window pump out the freshest lightest dumplings I have eaten. Whilst waiting you pre order food so once seated the meal arrives quite quickly. Dumplings were the highlight , spinach and roasted garlic, fluffy light rice with egg and slightly disappointing veggie buns. Bottomless cups of Jasmine tea but 50 cents for a glass of water a bit annoying but happened a lot in Singapore. Bill was $54 for 3 all vegetarians which given its position was very good value.Staff efficient but not super friendly
5
I really fell in love with this restaurant. I love dumpling and they serve very good ones. I tried their oriental salad so good and fresh and almost all steamed dumplings. I found that the best were: meat and broth, shrimps, chicken, veggies.I hope that they will start to run business in Europe too. Please we need Din Tai Fun in Italy.They serve delicious Jasmine tea
5
I really loved this place. The food is so good and not expensive. I enjoyed the oriental salad very fresh and several dumplings. I will suggest those with meat and broth , those with shrimp and also the veggie ones are so good.. The location is very nice as the staff and the service is very fast. I drink their wonderful jasmine tea. I hope that Din Tai Fun will open in Europe too
4
Food is always good here. Not many Asian cuisine options inside MBS complex besides food court. Dumplings are always good here and especially enjoy the mango prawns. The xiao long bao and spicy wontons, noodles are delicious also,
5
worth the wait,, the food is good and affordable. however be prepare to wait at least half an hour. simple chinese food.
4
Just by going there you get the firs taste of China. A variety of food to chose from and everything comes at the same time. A great place for a dinner and lunch.
5
This is Taiwanese Resto chain serving excellent Dimsums,popularly known as Momos in India.Excellent Soups & chinese dishes.Its moderately priced.Must visit when in Singapore.
4
My wife could not wait to try their bean buns. We had to place our order and then come back in 20 minutes or so due to it be very busy and the buns are made fresh when you order.
5
This restaurant is located in the mall. Doesn't look like anything spectacular, and you usually have to wait 5 to 20 minutes to be seated. Their soup dumplings are fabulous! Black truffle ones are the best!!!
4
Must book in the front desk first. Handmade dimsum was great but other dishes were average. A bit pricey tho
5
Don't be put off by having to wait. They give you a menu and an order sheet to fill in while you are waiting and the tables turn over quickly. This is the best chinese food you will ever have. We visit everytime we fly to Singpapore and have a stopover. There is nothing "flash" about the way they serve you, it's all very quick, but the food comes out in their individual bamboo baskets and is amazizng. Not too expensive and you NEVER leave hungry
5
This particular restaurant was a bit different from the few other DTF's we've been to, they had an additional menu on the table. But, there are only 2 reasons I visit any din tai fung in singapore - the Xiaolongbao (steamed pork dumplings) and the lemongrass juice. The steamed pork dumplings are the traditional Xiaolongbao or soupy dumplings, they literally melt in your mouth and are bursting with flavour. The lemongrass juice is a crisp, refreshing and flavourful drink that tastes subtly divine and really refreshes your senses and quenches. Service at this branch was prompt
5
Best dumpling dim sum meal of my life. Don't forget to order some greens - they were fresh, hot and tasty but everyone is here for the dumplings - pork, prawn, scallops the best - go for chilli pork. The Shiraz from South Australia is worth pushing the budget for - it was perfect balance for all the flavour explosions going on in my mouth. Supreme Masters of flavour - DO NOT MIS
4
The dumplings are their specials. It taste great and service is good. Will recommend clients to have dinner or lunch there.
5
Light, tasty and delicious dumplings. Din Tai Fung offer an incredible selection of the most amazing dumplings I have ever tasted.
4
A great meal. As always. Whether in Sydney or Singapore, Din tai Fung consistently delivers quality food.
4
two days in a row.yeah, correct, we had it here two days in a row.the food was great.love the service.the staffs keep themselves busy, very polite, work professionally.the queue was the only bad thing, but the food and the service was really worth the wait
5
The Din Tai Fung restaurants are incredible popular in Singapore and that is for a very good reason. They serve the best Chinese food one can imagine and at reasonable prices. In Din Tai Fung something as simple as dumblings suddenly taste like bites of heaven and the beef noodle soup is probably the best soup I have ever tasted. In addition both hygene and speed is second to none. The only negative point one might add is that the Din Tai Fung restaurants generally lack a bit of atmosphere: Don't expect candle light dinners
4
Xiao Long Bao was good as expected.But what made it more awesome was the none dimsum food we ordered.The pork chop was tender and juicy while the fried rice was smooth and had the right amount of salt that it complemented well with the pork chopPrawn cakes were also surprisingly good; Don't let its plain look fool you. its a pretty tasty
4
Din tai feng in mbs probably had one of the best xiao long Bao among the same franchise of din tai feng. I've tried the one at resort world and paragon and I found the one in mbs and paragon to be better.When you want to eat at the mbs branch either be early or you got to be prepared to wait for a long line up. It's almost surely that they have a long queue every day for lunch or dinner.Other food I liked in here is the Garlic fries dou miao and the egg fried rice. Their pork bone soup is delicious too
4
Always come back to this restaurant for their xiao long bao. As I see, the dumpling seems freshly made, steamed and served hot right from the steamer. What so special about dumpling in this restaurant is the soup inside dumpling, very tasty. I remember a about few years back been taught by the waiter of the restaurant (not this branch, in other country) to place the dumpling in the spoon 1st, pin the dumpling, enjoy the soup then just eat the dumpling. perfect !!Other than xiao long bao, their dumpling noodle also not bad. We also try chili crab bun that rarely found in other similar restaurantService good but tend to be crowded and need to queueOver the years and countries this restaurant always maintain its quality for their signature dishes xiao long ba
4
Loved the Food and that you could watch them how they prepare the dumbling from A-Z.The variations are endless and all of them were good to very good.All fresh to order and delicious ingredients.Service is quick, friendly and efficient.The only down side we saw was that its quite loud and more like a university cafeteria, which I understand at some places in the city center but I would have expected a bit more classy environment for a restaurant in the Sands Complex.Food perfect and a recommendation to try but also don't forget to go to the Streetfood places around the hotel and in the city as you will also find there good food
4
Din Tai Fung (Paragon) was the first place I ever had XLB (Xia Long Bao) and I've been in love ever since. Some say it's not the best, but damn -- it's pretty darn good! I ALWAYS get at least 6 of these bad boys for myself -- sometimes more! I also like the Kai Lan, and Hot and Sour soup. This time I also tried a nice salad that had jelly fish (tasty if simple) as well as some "fried shrimp with walnut sauce" (or something close) and that was good too! Too much food! The service was decent -- did have to flag down a waiter to place the order but everything went fine after that. Of course, they were very busy (what gold mines!)So this location seems every bit as good as Paragon or Raffles .. solid consistency
5
Went to this chain restaurant with a local. She picked steamed bun dishes. Wow! Really fresh, amazing combination of flavors. And not that expensive. Great place for a quick business lunch if you beat the crowd.
5
here comprises all you want taste here, nice chinese and singapoan foods, the taste was strange but reall delicious. Nice place for dinner with your lovers
5
Excellent food despite the wait. We were in line twice for 45 minutes and did not regret it once. A tip is to get your number in line and then go shopping for a while.
We will certainly go back if we get the opportunity.
5
Great fresh food, served quickly and efficiently. This is not a restaurant for a long lunch, but great for a quick bite when you are in a hurry. A wide selection, we particularly loved the pork dumplings. You can find these restaurants all over Singapore.
4
There are many branches in Singpore, the one in Marina Bay Sands is probably one of the best in terms of taste and service
5
This was a really unusual experience to find such a queue outside a restaurant and the unique number system. we stood back and watched for a few minutes to understand people were collecting their order forms, writing their own orders down and then waiting for their number to be called. once seated, you hand over your order form and things arrive as they are cooked. the xiao long bao dumplings are the best I have ever eaten, even trying them at the same chain in sentosa and Sydney, they all taste the same. The black vinegar, chilli oil and ginger top these little bundles of joy off. beware, the steamed soup dumplings are the temperature of the sun. once you have that soup burn, you never forget. These are cheap for the area! $10 a tray, and are served quickly, well recommended in this expensive area
3
Went there for lunch yesterday and was rather disappointed with the Xiao Long Bao. Normally the broth in the dumpling is piping hot but the ones that we were served was at best luke warm. Looks like it has been sitting away from the steamer for some time before it was brought to our table. Another disappointment was the Bak Chang (Steam Rice Pork dumpling) The rice was rather bland and the pork a touch to "porky" for me.The rest of the dishes was just OK. Service wise, although we were there during the peak lunch hour, we were seated rather quickly and our food order was brought to our table very quickly.Ambiance wise, the place was a tad too noisy for good business related conversation.In summary, have had better quality in other Din Tai Fung outlets
4
One of the busiest Din Tai Fung branch in Singapore. Always packed and long queue to get a table. Despite the packed crowd, the service is fast & attentive. Even though it's a long wait, you can go off to the shops while you wait your turn, you're also given an order form to choose your foods & drinks, the menu board also displayed in front of the restaurant. Delicious food as always, but have to say the variety of the menu in Din Tai Fung Singapore is much fewer than the Din Tai Fung menu in Jakarta, Indonesia that has a wider selection
5
We tried here before a show at the marina bay theatre. We were lucky to only have a 20 minute wait & got a table for 4. We chose lots of different dishes to share which were all delicious. The prices were resonable too. The servers weren't the best, but didn't do anything bad either. Would recommend & will return
4
Michelin star awarded and ranked as one of the world’s Top Ten Best Restaurants by The New York Times, Din Tai Fung started in Taiwan 40 years ago. I heard about it thru word-of-mouth from friends who have tasted its famous signature xiao long baos or steamed pork dumplings. So we checked it out at the Marina Bay Sands and ordered their famous xiao long baos or steamed pork dumplings traditionally contain minced pork wrapped in a delicate dough skin, which is then pleated, twisted at the top and steamed. Din Tai Fung’s signature rendition consists of juicy meat filling wrapped in a melt-in-your-mouth skin with a minimum of 18 exquisite folds according to their site. True to their word, it is fresh and simply steamed, it's not too rich or heavy. We also ordered their noodle soup, pork buns and chili crab and pork buns which I enjoyed more than the xiao long baos. I guess it really is a matter of taste. Btw, they also have an open kitchen where you can see how your dumplings are made

I like tasting the various culinary delights for anywhere I travel. It was one of the best experience.
5
Love this place. Food is always spot on and service is fast. Highly recommended if you are in Singapore.
5
Dumplings are just a delicious food, and at this restaurant it was a great experience, because you can see all the preparation, it is a fast service... and everything in the menu is super good... is a must try...
5
Just yum. There's not a bad dish on the menu. Everything is great. We tried it first in Sydney and that was the best so had to visit in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. The meat in peppers is a must and the dumplings of course
3
When DTF 1st opened, I loved its dumplings and fried rice. The dumplings skin now is rather thick and has hardened(especially top part) when served. We did not order the dumplings this round and ordered the fried rice. The eggs were not mixed into the rice evenly.The service standards has also dropped. 1st, they did not offer my son(3 yrs old) a kids cutlery set. And even with quite a no of waiters and waitresses, they do not seemed to be looking out for customers signals. Sigh, may have to slowly boycott this restaurant soon
5
Walking through the Marina Bay Sands complex was a treat in its own right. Visiting the Din Tai Fung was the climax for that evening. It was 8pm and a long queue. The front window displayed part of the kitchen and personnel working hard on the dumplings. It was fascinating to watch them at work. Prior to queuing, we had to decide what we were going to order and the menu was displayed next to the window. We were given a number and our turn arrived 45 minutes later. Sufficient time to stroll through this enormous shopping centre. We were shown to our places and then the feast commenced. Dumpling of all sizes and tastes. Steaming hot with tastes out of this world. Pork Soup was great. Strongly recommended. Din Tai Fung has branches all over Singapore
4
Long wait, even at 9 pm. At least you can order before entering. Once inside they try to make you buy more than what is on your list. They were a bit pushy. But our meal was really good. We tried one of the Shrimp and Pork wonton noodles soup. Would eat this soup again
2
I don't know why there are so many good reviews of this restaurant. The food was so bland and there was hardly any service to speak of. I ate here at the tail end of a 2 month trip through Asia (3 weeks were spent in China) so I have several other restaurants to compare to this one. Don't expect much of you choose to eat here.
4
DTF is always a great choice, especially if you have children.In this outlet, they also serve their black truffle dim sums - exceptional.They also have wine (truffles with tea or beer... no way!), but you have to ask for it, as it doesn't appear on the order sheet.The only negative point is that it's too crowded. Being located really close to the MBS Theater, it's the obvious choice for people going to, or getting out of, a show. Depending on the time you go there, you can be asked to wait more than 30 - 40 minutes just to get a table, and another 20 before you get served. So you might want to check the theater's show times before you decide at what time you want to show up at the restaurant
5
I love the yum cha foods and was told about this place that does the soup dumplings. We started with a salad, not too bad, then had duck spring rolls and rice. Ordered the Rose drink that was strong so ordered a water to level it out. Then the dumplings came, these are awesome, pork soup dumplings are the bomb. They just explode. The best i have ever had.The restaurant is super clean with staff with hair nets and face masks. Well worth the wait. I also went to the same restaurant chain in Sentosa and the quality was the same
5
This was the best dim sum (and I have eaten a lot of dim sum!). Every dish was awesome and delicious. I will go back again.
4
I opted to have my lunch here since I was waiting for the check-in time at MBS. There's only a short queue and we were assisted immediately. I really enjoyed their noodles and Xiao long bao! Can't get over! I'm still craving until today!
4
Cant go wrong here. Simple Taiwan style food with amazing quality and very affordable price.. Be prepare to Q during meal times.
4
You have to try as many dishes as you can there. You will not regret it. Even though the person who accompanied me was vegeterian, she could select a few items there.
4
I tried the famous xiao lung bao at Din Tai Fung and it did not disappoint. Although Din Tai Fung is part of a chain, the quality of the food served is good and is excellent value.
4
Not sure if it was the queue outside or being able to watch the action in the kitchen through the glass window that made us decide to try this restaurant for a Sunday lunch. A team of chefs was busy rolling folding and steaming tiny, beautifully formed dumplings with intricate folds of pastry that we just had to try.After being given a number we waited approx 20 minutes for a table, during the wait time we filled out our lunch order from a printed list. As we were shown to the table the waitress suggested we try a ready made salad as the food would be another 20 minutes. No problem, we enjoyed the salad, ordered a beer and watched the action. This is a very busy and bustling cafe style restaurant with many families enjoying a shared lunch and good times. It didn't take long for the steamer baskets to be delivered, filled with the tiny dumplings. With accompaniments of chilli, soy and vinegar we tucked into a truly delicious meal. The pork buns were so light and fluffy, not like the often stodgy variety served in many dim sum restaurants. A serve of Kai Lan was very fresh and still crispy, not doused in garlic as is so often served. The steamed dumplings fresh, light and beautifully formed, filled with delicious morsels of pork, prawn and vegetables. Amazing that chefs are still making these all by hand as you order.The price is very reasonable and certainly worth a visit to see the traditional delicacies still being made to order
5
This is one of the busiest places to have quick lunch... and it shows why.. the food is amazing.. it was a 20 min wait to get seated... and then another 15-20 mins before the food arrived.. but it was worth the wait.. Dim sums were just amazing.
5
So I read all the reviews for this chain and was determined to try it before we left Singapore. I didn't know what on earth I was ordering and I was prepared for the hour wait. Even though it's a long wait you're given a ticket and you can go off to the shops while you wait your turn, so it really isn't that bad, you are also given an order form to preselect your meal from the menu outside the restaurant. My husband and I were stupidly ordering everything apart from the dumplings and a Singaporean lady overheard us talking about what to order. She said "please if you do nothing else order the Xiao long Bao. Every time my nephew comes over from Australia he asks to come here and he says it tastes better than hamburgers!" With that recommendation we swiftly ordered the pork Xiao long Bao, neither of us are keen on pork or dumplings but we had to give it a go. Boy oh boy are we glad we did. We ordered ten and were virtually fighting over them! The pastry is paper thin and the filling is a tasty soup, it explodes with flavour in your mouth, then melts... Best thing I ate all trip! We also ordered the steamed buns with crab, sweet, delicious and light, I could have had more. Because we were clueless, we ordered fried rice, pork sweet and sour, spinach, etc etc. do yourselves a favour and fill up on the dumplings and buns. The other stuff is nice but really you should try what the restaurant is famous for. It is worth every penny and the long wait.Loved it
4
We joined the queue as we have always been happy with the food at other branches. When called the Table Allocator yelled us into our seats, harshly scribbled out our selections that had sold out and told us all food would be 30 minutes. In fact the food came quite quickly. There was a mix of hits and misses. Highlights were the oriental salad, stuffed chillies, duck in crispy parcels and the chicken soup. Not so impressed with the hot and sour soup and the dumplings but overall left feeli g very happy with the experience!
4
Just turn up, tell them how many of you dining and get given a number and you'll be eating tasty and great value dim sum in less than 20mins even when really busy. You make yourself known when your number comes up and the sit, choose and write your options you want on the little pre printed paper. The menu is extensive enough without being overwhelming. Be careful, though we ordered almost twice as much as we needed as got carried away. My tip would be order some, eat, then order more and repeat. The stuff comes quickly so it won't disrupt the flow of the night. Even after ordering far too much it still only worked out like Â£30 a head with drinks. What's also nice here is you can see into the kitchen and prep away to watch the busy make the dim sumOverall a nice casual buzzy dinner, good for visiting with relaxed clients or friends. Oh but last order is 21:30 so leave enough time
4
Love all the shanghainese side dishes. We ate xiao long bao, drunken chicken, dumplings etc. while still piping hot.
3
There are other branches, not as crowded and rushed. Food is above average, so if you really want some "xiao long bao", go to other outlets.
5
Signature Din Tai Fung dishes, meaning excellent dumplings!
We liked the fact that when it got busy this location asked guests to fill out the order form while waiting for a seat, which sped up the service.
4
The food here is the same good standard as the other brands. However the location is good as it is less crowded compared to the others. I will always go to this one if I want to have a nice lunch.
5
I like the yum cha and noodles. I dislike the curry as it is a bit too spicy. In general the food is tasty and recommended for the average traveller and tourist including the locals
5
We were happy to find din tai fung at MBS. As usual, food quality is top notch with good service. Go early in the day to avoid crowds
5
Superb dumplings, period
Love to watch them make them in the window.
Good price, great value.
It has long lines for a reason...
5
Wow! What fabulous food, and great staff. This restaurant chain has put it all together in a nice package and been able to replicate the great taste and service across its many outlets.The choice of food is extensive and the price is most reasonable.Beware, there may be a wait for a table at lunchtime, but it is worthwhile
4
A long day we had after a convention at MBS and we decided to stop at the restaurant enroute to the food court (which seems to be miles away).But we were given a number and a order chit as we were told there is a waiting list. The number on the sign says 327, our tag says 342, the face on my lady says "I don't wanna walk anymore..."and so we waited. about 30 minutes later we got a table.We took an hour to finish our food and walked to pay our bill.But the food was worth mentioning:1) Fried rice with eggs (蛋炒饭) - extraordinary taste in an ordinary dish.2) Soup Dumpling (小笼包) - could have beaten many in China and Hong Kong. Nice of them to use a piece of farbic at the base of the steamer bamboo tray and the dumpling skin was thicker than many so that it could actually hold the soup within and not break easily.Some in China and HK actually used paper base and a much thinner wrapping due to cost.3) Spicy Oil Dumpling (红油抄手) - Very very good. The dish is suppose to be oily but this one is not too oily. Everything was just right and the fillings were cooked to perfection.I may be wrong with the English names of the dishes cos all items were listed in Chinese on the receipt, and I apologise.The only bad thing about this place is the wait, but it is all worth it. I was thinking if the restaurant could be a little bit more thoughtful to have arrange more seats outside for those queuing in line, and it would be perfect.But I guess they can afford customers getting tired of waiting and walk away. Ah well..
5
come dine to see what all the hype is about - you won't be disappointed! but seats fill up fast so come early (they open at 1100) so you don't have to wait so long. the drink portions are tiny and you'll have to flag down staff for even a water refill. no napkins are given (as in most restaurants in singapore) so come prepared. everything was yummy. read the menu beforehand so you can get your order in quick and eat soon
5
This was our first ever meal in a dim sim place & we ended up eating there every day! Amazing won tons, pork chops. It's always busy but worth the wait
4
Everything was good. But portions are not so big. House water is not free. Service was fast. This restaurant is quite popular so reservation is a must.
5
never had these "melt in your mouth" dumplings--------the flavors just burst in your mouth when you pop them in.....magical and not too expensive!
3
Good food. Efficient operations. Steamed Pork Dumplings manufactured and served in assembly style operations taste still a notch higher than most counterparts. Love the yangchow rice. But to be really honest, food wise we liked their Beijing branch far better.
5
I have been to a couple of others branches - but Singapore is still nicest. A little wait followed by great, fresh food that get's out fast.
5
The food at Din Tai Fung is some of the best Asian food I have ever had. The restaurant is run in an efficient way with helpful staff.

We're staying in MBS overnight and arriving Singapore early in the morning, we're lucky to check-in early for a quick nap before heading to the food courts for a quick bite early afternoon.Being a Saturday morning, we're pleasantly surprised that the queue in front of this particular Din Tai Fung was not long -- we ate at the Din Tai Fung at Suntec early this year and it was hectic I tell you -- so we quickly put our names down and happily moved on to look around the shops.Little more than 20 minutes later, we got our table setup and we ordered 2 steamed dim sims, including a Citibank special (half price paid by Citi card), a noodle dish and 2 small side dishes.The steamed dishes arrived in no time and they're delicious! Not long before the drunken chicken & the noodles delivered -- they're not bad but not exciting. We didn't order tea but they arrived any time, and we're charged accordingly. Not expensive by any means but that's interesting?All in all, not a bad Din Tai Fung experience compared to our Taipei endeavour, but I must say quality wise it can be improved
4
Was staying at MBS so decided to swing here for an early lunch. Early enough so that you can avoid the hordes of people waiting after 1215pm. When inside, it seems they kept half the restaurant empty! And made the queue worse! Did they do that because they lack manpower? It did seem that way Ordered the usual good stuff - dumplings, wanton in chilli, noodles in beef broth. All good, in the consistent DTF way. But at $30 per pax, it's getting a little expensive for a simple lunch. I think it's the expensive quality of living in Singapore and inflatio
5
Beijing Dumplings in the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Mall were the best dumplings I had in Singapore. Probably the best I ever had in my life. The service is a fast and efficient. The place is a little bit clinical looking with simple decor but the food... Fantastic! The selection of the food was big and also I enjoyed the chicken noodle soup. You can see the kitchen and witness how fresh the food is. The food is made on the spot for you. Great prices. It is not a place for a romantic first date but definitely fantastic for the food with family or friends. I wish to go back there now
5
This chain of restaurants was recommended by some friends who used to live in Singapore & we happened to be at this branch at dinner time. It is very busy & the choice of dishes can be daunting as the staff like things to be quick. The steamed dumplings with crab are a must as are the stuffed chillis (not spicy). The shanghai chicken was delicious but was cold which we were not expecting. Good fun although not a relaxing dining experience
4
This is one of the standard din tai fung as you can find in Singapore. Decent food. If you are looking for ath special within mbs, there are more choices there. But if you want Din Tai Fung, you wont be disappointed.
5
My favourite Chines restaurant, xiao long pao is perfect, never get bored of their food, service is perfect
4
as the brunches of din tai fund in the world, there is nothing less to expect. Queue is always there so be prepared to wait for 30 mins before getting a seat in the restaurant. food is great! nothing much to complain about.
5
Very. Authentic. Chinese. Everything is a must try and don't forget to get there a bit early coz in a minute, it starts a very long queue. Also, you may notice the sanitation of every crew. Recommended!
4
If you don't know this place, don't tell anyone! This is the best unkept secret for xiao long bao, little dumplings filled with pork and soup that burst open when you bite into them.The trick is to get the number right. 4-6 is about right for me but I've seen some down 10.Also good is the fried rice with egg and pork, the won ton in a delicious chicken soup.I haven't been disappointed at any of their outlets.
3
After watching "Le Noir", we decided to have dinner at Din Tai Fung. As it was dinner time, we had to wait for nearly an hour before we got a table. Having eaten at the Din Tai Fung in Taipei previously, we thought the quality of the food can be further improved
3
Not sure why, but this branch always has a huge throng of people queuing in front of the restaurant. The food is okay, but for that queue, perhaps it would be better to go to other branches? I always go for the original xiao long bao and the xiao cai, perennial pleasers
5
The "Shoppes" at Marina Bay Sands are exhausting for the accompanying male, so it is a relief that an excellent lunch can be got quickly at this restaurant. Dumpling specialists. These are made by a horde of while suited masked chefs in view of the diners. The Pork Dumplings have a delightful explosion of delicious stock. They should be eaten in one mouthful, unless you want to spill it all down your shirt
3
I got hooked on this restaurant after seeing its advertisement on the plane. I guess ads does work..sigh.Unfortunately, my impression on this is just an OK. The portion is quite small for the price you pay. But the signature xiaolongbao is quite good. Still, the portion could be bigger. Not to mention the wait in the queue
4
Great food! I've went to different outlets of Din Tai Fung and they had never failed the expectation I've been giving! The fried rice and xiaolongbao (xlb) is a must to try! I suggest that the original is good enough. I would also recommend their prawn pancake, i could not remember its exact name. But it is somewhere along that line. Great food, love it :) Not absolute dim sum, so do not expect complete menu of dim sum! More to a mixture of food. Do try fried rice!!! I strongly recommend, go early and be prepared for queues
4
As per any trip to Din Tai Fung, we of course had a decent order of their reowned and simply perfect Xiao Long Bao.
Quality is consistent as what you expect from any Din Tai Fung chain globally.
5
I am addicted to this restaurant's food. From the time you select your choices, until the time it arrives, you are salivating with expectation. Just absolutely yum.
1
Forced to eat here courtesy of a business meeting. Just appalling.
Take the trouble to go elsewhere for real dim sum. This is not it.
5
Been to this chain many times and always happy to walk out with belly full of yummy handmade dim sum.
4
Delicious, varied, reasonable, quick and clean! The green apple juice is terrific, as is the fried rice and raviolis. The vegetable dishes are excellent too.
4
Great food, great atmosphere, lots of local (must be good), and very very friendly service, will revisit on next stay at Marina Bay Sands Hotel
5
This is awesome, great pork dumplings, great side dishes- spicy cucumber+++, turned me from a non dumpling person to a dumpling lover. Many stores all over Singapore this is a must do.
5
Nothing beats the Xiao Long Bao in Din Tai Fung! the best! addictive! and very fast paced restaurant, waiters should be fast to let others sit in your table because of the long line.
5
Had dumplings here a couple of times post conference. Despite shopping mall surrounds and modest decor, the food is fantastic.All the dumplings are hand made in front of you and delicious. The signature pork soup dumplings are awesome, as are the pork and chilli crab steamed buns. There are several outlets around town. Great foo
5
Din Tai Fung restaurants are all well known for fresh and delicious food. This branch of the franchise did not disappoint! We had to line up for 1 hours even outside of lunch hour. It was worth the wait and food was quick to arrive and service prompt.Definitely visit if in the area, otherwise there are other branches that are just as impressive.YUM YUM YU
5
Nice Chinese food especially the fried dumplings , good service by staff very creative to have a trolley just for our bags, The Dim sum tasted nice , loved the Xiao Long Bao especially
5
Long queue and waiting time notwithstanding, this is the best dimsum place in Singapore! Don't forget their signature Xiao Long Bao as well as the pork chop fried rice...yummy!
1
We were pleased after 2 weeks bali for a few days shopping in singapore, instead we were with a gastric-intestinal poisoning the whole stay in bed. recommended in no case!!!!!!!
5
Fabulous, fast & Fresh.
I ate here twice for lunch over a 3 day stay in Singapore! Slightly pricey, but everything is in Singapore.
Shrimp dumplings & pork buns were favourites.
A big restaurant, can get noisy at times.
5
If you first time in Singapore you must visit this restaurant excellent food and quality value the number of people eating here tells you the visible kitchen is doing a great job , will be back and you should visit
5
Went here in a bad mood as the Marina Bay Sands Hotel where we were staying was such a let down but this place was excellent. Tasty well priced food and we didn't get a dish which wasn't excellent. Not for a special occasion but yes for special food
5
Yes, their signature dumplings are very good and they do amazing deep fried triangles with prawns and pork, also crispy duck wontons. Price is reasonable but avoid during lunch time huge crowds, we went around 11 am and still had to wait for pork dumplings 30 minutes. Second time we went just as they open and it was ok. Must try if you like dim sum
5
Yes, we could not stay away from ding tai fung dumplings no matter which city we are ! Our hotel told us that there is a Ding Tai Fung within walking distance and here we are ! Came here for a late lunch after shopping at the shoppes at Marina Bay. Its a great and very conveneint location. Just like in taipei, we needed to queue here but it was very fast and we were quickly shown to our seats. The drunken shanghai chicken is a great starter to the delicious crabmeat dumplings to follow. The xiaolongbao is a defnite must try. We also had the shrimp fried rice, braised noodle soup. Every dish was delicious and consistent with the high standard of this restaurant chain. The service is as usual and expected - fast and effieicent. Ding Tai Fung will always be a reaturant that I will recommend for fabulous dumplings, fast service and reasonable price
5
Just fabulous! The restaurant just a bit noisy and at the peak time you might stay in line to go there however this place is a must!The kitchen is visible and looks like nuclear reactor :) everyone is in the deep fog. We tried many dishes from the menu but the pork and chicken dumplings are our favourites. Simply deliciou
5
Went for late breakfast one day just to find out i have to come back for lunch next day:) Tasty dim sums, all food really fresh and well priced. I would go back and back if I stayed longer in Singapore. Quick service having in mind all prepped on site right there with a nice touch to be able to see how they make dim sums over the glass window. Pop in and will not regret 100
5
Best Dim Sum you can imagine......., good location in the middle of a shopping centre....., open until 11 p.m., try the truffles Dim Sum..
5
Everything in MBS has high price tag except Din Tai Fung. The pricing is similar to other outlets in city.
5
We had lunch here after a morning site seeing. We had been to a similar one in Hong Kong and were ready to be disappointed - we were not and had an excellent meal with discreet and attentive service
5
I loved the xiao long bao and the noodles...... what i don't like though is the long queuing which makes you starve while waiting, but it's all worth it........
4
I was there with my asian friend, actually she recomended this place. She made a chose for both of us and it was really good. I'm not sure that I could cope without her help, because asian food was new to me.
3
Been to many of their outlets and food was to be expected. I often encountered that service in Chinese restaurants and Western restaurant are a world apart. Why are "smiles so expensive in Chinese restaurants"? I continue to wonder....
4
I have found the quality of food quite consistent throughout all Din Tai Fung, and like the Taiwanese cuisine. What stops me from going more often is the fact that there is always a queue, This branch is packed during the day with people working in MBFC, but it is very easy to get a table in the evening.There is only one thing that irritates me a bit about the restaurant. The people bringing the food often don't speak a word of English, and can't tell you what they just put in front of you
5
What a great place!Visiting the eye wateringly expensive Marina Bay Sands we were looking for somewhere for lunch. Our attention was caught by the very efficient and energetic human production line making dumplings in the window of the restaurant. We asked for a table and were given a number and a menu / order card. We were told there was a few minutes wait for a table. Within seconds our number came up on the electronic display above the door and we were led briskly to a table inside. The ordering process is efficient - you fill in your order including drinks on the card - and it is quickly whisked away. Shortly after steaming baskets of dumplings and bowls of delicious noodle soup arrived; served with equally efficiency. For this is no place to linger over a romantic meal with your loved one. On the contrary, this is a well organized, efficient machine for serving very good food to large numbers of people and it delivers on every aspect. Brilliantly. From those guys making dumplings in the window to the chefs in the steam wrapped open kitchen this place is designed, no engineered, to delivering satisfying tasty food on an almost industrial scale. I believe there are several of these restaurants on Singapore. Give one a try - I doubt you will be disappointed! Oh, and it's bloody good value for money!
5
I am addicted to din Tai Fung. I admit it. Ever since we visited shanghai a couple of years ago, I have been addicted to this chain because it is so close to the real thing. You only have to see the 10-20 people hand making dumplings continuously in any store to know how fresh this is. Chilli and soy with ginger and a dumpling is my version of heaven. Salivating now just thinking about it.
4
You can see the dim sun being made went there last night very lucky no waiting great food shame that the minimum order for each dim sum is six means that if you are a couple you can't really try a lot of different types or you waste a lot of good.
4
Great mall in Marina Bay and great restaurant also.we wait abut ten minutes to get seated.The menus it not too much but we ordered the specialty from that restaurant,the dumpling.The taste is so yummy and the so perfect
5
super clean,great value and just the best hand made steam dumplings. Something for everyone on the menu
5
If you want to try din tai fung prefer this one rather than the one in paragon mall nice atmosphere less noise try crab dumplings and noodles worth for a quick clean and nice food
5
I visited after seeing reviews on trip advisor. Was absolutely amazing. Treated myself to the truffle dumpling, which i honestly recommend to all. Went solo but as they allow takeaway, i ordered a few things to try. No complaints! Only praise! Will be returning!
5
We had a great lunch at Din Tai Fung. When we arrived, there was a queue for seating due to the popularity of this restaurant. To expidiate this, you're handed a piece a paper for menu selection and the menu is posted outside the restaurant. This process saves time since once seated, you hand your menu selection which they will prepare. The pastry on the dumplings are quite thin and delicate. There was no disappointment. If you like dim sum, you must eat here
5
We walked past this place several times and loved watching them make the dumplings, so we decided to give this a try. While there was a little wait (20 minutes), it wasn't as long as first expected. The wait also gave us the time to really exam the colourful menu out the front to make heads or tails of what we wanted to eat. We chose a variety of dishes ( my family is so fussy, it takes a few different dishes to satisfy everyone!). We were definitely not disappointed. The food was so fresh tasting and the dumplings and wontons had such thin surrounds that the fillings really shone. We added to our order twice. We added pork buns ( and needed to wait a bit of time as these are made fresh) and the mango pudding ( this has such a Devine fresh taste and was such a great end to the meal).So worth the wait and visit
5
The stuffed peppers were awesome!I went three times in three days. Had the hot and sour soup, dumplings the fried pork and many other things. I loved everything I had and would highly recommend going. There will likely be a wait but what good restaurant does not have a wait.When you check I they give you an order form and to the right of the hostess there is a large board with pictures of all the food and a corresponding number. Get out of your comfort zone and order something you have not had. The the left is the open kitchen where you can watch them make the dumplings with exacting precision. Adding or subtracting ingredients with tweezers so portions are consistent, each dumpling has 12 folds and exactly 12. If I had one of these at home I would go twice a week
5
loved the food here. agree in part with other TA comments, however calling it multi-michelin star is really a push. Food is great, fresh and quite fast. Didnt like the limited vegetarian options, nor did i like the limited pork-free options. The food we did order was great. Would definitely go back when next in singapor
5
Since we were staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel, we decided to visit Din tai Fung famous for its delicious dumplings. Always a constant high standard, we were very happy again in this branch of Din Tai Fiung enjoying our favorite crab meat dumplings, braised beef noodles and drunken chicken. Every dish was good and up to the din Tai Fung Standard. The service was attentive and fast despite a full house. A good stop for food and some rest after an afternoon of shopping at Marina Bay Sands
5
I love this place. Over the years, it is good to know that the quality and procedure has not changed. We love all the dumplings, and always order together with the soup with pork wontons in superior chicken broth and prawn & egg rice. I could eat at this establishment in any of its locations every day
4
Always packs are crowd but we were lucky to get seats. Anything on the menu is great tasting although the servings are miniscule.
order from the paper menu and enjoy.
5
Best dumplings my husband and I have ever eaten. Great service and great selection. Reasonably priced too.
Enough said.
5
We had passed this restaurant and few times and watched the kitchen hand making the dumplings. We eventually tried it when meeting a friend who stays in Singapore. Our initial reservations were quickly dispelled. It is always busy and has a nice canteen type atmosphere, a bit like a 5* fast food restaurant, so don't expect a fine dining experience for ambience and atmosphere but you definitely get a 5* dining experience. You order on a clipboard choosing all your choices including drinks from a "menu". The food you ordered arrives in short order and usually all altogether (a bit dis-jointed if you are used to starters then mains), or a few minutes between delivery. What makes this is the quality of the food and the prices. Absolutely first rate. We returned to another of their branches a couple of nights later. Can't wait to return

I ate at this place once during my stay in Singapore and can only recommend it.The food is extremely good and has a nice home made taste.They actually make the dumplings on demand and you can even see them while they prepare them. It's kind of an experience itself.The place is crowded and fast paced so it kind of feels like being at a 5 star Mc Donald's, maybe not the best for a romantic dinner.The prices are ok, actually quite cheap compared to the quality you get.Highly recommended

After an average stay at the Marina Bay Sands hotel adjoining, this restaurant was a saving grace of the trip. I ate there on 3 of the 4 days of my trip. Expect northern Chinese food and especially if you like dumplings, noodles and side dishes served freshly made, piping hot and at their best. The dumplings are "made to order" and don't come out of a frozen supply - see the glass walled room where they are made by the restaurant's chefs. The chain hails from Taiwan, and so the menu is a type of PanChinese fusion food- the ingredients for the dumplings for instance combine northern Chinese and Taiwan touches. Tried the following: Shanghai Dumplings - xiao long baoCrab and pork dumplings Shrimp and pork dumplings Spicy dumplings Pork chop atop egg fried riceBean sprouts with fresh shrimp on topCucumbers with garlic chiliBasically it's all good food; awarded Michelin stars (certainly for the Hong Kong branches of the chain) and of an equivalent standard in Singapore. Last order is at about 9.45 pm at night. Expect queues from 7 to 8.30 pm. However the meal is an experience and you will be glad that you walked the 50 metres from the Marina Bay Sands hotel and skipped on the crappy room service ... Expect to pay about SG$30 per person - which is actually cheaper than 1 dish ordered from the hotel's room service menu. Go figure.

Xiao Long Bao clearly defines Din Tai Fung. Although I'm not well-travelled, I doubt anyone else does it better. The crab variant for the main course and then the red bean variant for dessert would bring one to Xiao Long Bao heaven. It may just be a difference in taste but having eaten in various branches in Singapore and in China, I seem to find the one in China about 2-3 notches better - in all aspects actually, food, service and cleanliness. Have yet to try the original one in Taiwan so I'm looking forward to that
4
Tried Din Tai Fung after previously favouring the Food Court - was a great decision. Lovely fresh ingredients, you can really taste the difference. Good prices - can get much cheaper in food halls and inner city - however you pay the premium for still being in the hotel
4
A fast-food type place with an open kitchen (where they make the dumplings) and cook them. Service efficient. Dumplings excellent (but nothing fancy) -- we tried with pork, with pork and shrimp, port and crab meat, and couple of varieties of wantons. Wine list very limited.Good place to go to if you are shopping and want a break, or if you fancy simple dumplings (which are indeed excellent). Not a place if you want something upscale or romantic
5
We had just visited the marina bay sky deck and was wondering around the mall and found this place by accident. Can't recall the exact name of the dumpling we shared it was crab meat and something (I think the chef's special for the month), the sliced duck in crispy spring onion pastry, and the apple juice (fresh, fresh, fresh). Was delicious. As we were sharing our food the line out the door grew and grew and grew. There must have been 50-70 people waiting to get in the joint. Admit-tingly it was lunch time. Guess we just got in at the right time
4
Last night we dined at Din Tai Fung in the Marina Bay Sands and I'd have to say "it was a futuristic expience". Set in the Marina Bay Sands "shopping suburb" which feels like we've settled the moon and this is the world we created. We were promptly given a menu and a number and told there was was a 20 min wait. We sat in the mall and pondered. The number display pinged along and before we knew it, we were being lead to our table, with another group. Efficient. The food was good, most arrived at a temperate heat (not good), served by masked storm troopers, at steady intervals. I recommend Din Tai Fung, as it is a good example of how dining can progress. This is not fine dining, far from it. It was never meant to be. It's canteen, great canteen. Enjoy.

Nothing outstanding. Ordinary food. But it's cheap and nice.
5
If ou like xiao lung pao thismis the place to get it.
Was priviledged to try the one with truffle oil. Defintely
Recommended..
Getbthe crab xiao lung pao its bliss!
3
The quality of food for Din Tai Fung has been pretty standard regardless of which branch you visit. So don't expect anything too exciting. But I would say the food is still good.
5
A last minute decision was a good idea. The service and the food were A1. Highly recommended. The dumplings and pork buns are awesome.
4
I found Din tai fung in Singapore! WOW
Not so many people were in line, so I ate Pork Xiao Long Bao without waiting so long. Same tasts as Taiwang and Tokyo!
3
Same food as at other Din Tai Fung establishments in Singapore, but this one tends to be much quieter for weekday lunches as compared to the nearby outlet in the MBFC.The dumplings are very good but the rest of the offerings are nothing particularly special
4
I don't recommend going here during peak time & if you are really hungry, as more people are lining -up to be seated. But if you're patient enough, its really worth a wait!The food is great and taste good, some of my favorites are of course their best selling xiao lung pao (steamed ground pork in a wrap), siomai w/ shrimp, fried rice with porkchop (serving is good enough for 2 pax), their seaweed salad, and their service tea ^_^This is just my observation, the service tea (this its jasmine tea) is being filled repeatedly by the time you get there until the food is served . But when they see that you don't have much food in the table, the service tea filling becomes seldom. hahaha!But definitely, its one of the best Chinese resto I've been with
4
The menu is huge, with so many things to choose from, so bring your friends to get a little bit of everything. Everything we ordered was delicious, but not everything we ordered arrived. They never put down our request for 'the special' which would have been free since we ate more than $xx of food, and it was one of the items that got us in the door! So we were disappointed with their forgetfulness (or was it purposely left off since it would have been free?) but thoroughly enjoyed everything else
5
I've tried 3 kinds of dumplings and they were all delicious. Too bad I found out this place the last day of my stay in Singapore. I would go back only to eat here again!!!A bit busy for lunchtime but a must to try!!!Service not really nice... as in all Singapore!
5
If you are in Singapore you must go to Din Tai Fung. The pork soup dumplings, vegetable dumplings as well as the shrimp and pork gyoza are must have dishes. We eat here on every trip to Singapore and are amazed at the quality (the dumplings are made fresh in front of the restaurant) as well as the value of the meal. We order a lot if food and the bill is usually around $35 USD. Do not hesitate, just go !
5
While,you sit back and enjoy your favourite dumpling you can not fail to be impressed I'm the boys and girls in the front of house making the dumplings by hand. Yum yum :-)
5
Wow. Wow. Wow I have had din tai fung numerous times but it still does not disappoint. The dumplings be them seafood, be it pork, be it vegetables or combined are just simply put awesome. The noodle dishes are also golden.
4
I am usually not fond of dumplings, but I like those made at this place.
It's a popular venue, be prepared for 30+ minutes waiting time.
I went on a Thursday night, they did not accept news clients after 9PM so go early!
5
This does have fantastic dumplings...no other place beats it!! The menu is quite extensive and have great noodles too. Came back 3 days in a row!! YUMMY..
2
The dim sum were average. The pork ribs in the bitter gourd soup were not fresh. Not worth the price as you can get tastier one at kopitiam or hawker centre. Quite a disappointment.
5
Busy place...but they have a number system and they give u the menu while you are waiting...so take a pen. very tasty...great for light lunch...would be expensive if you were starving.
4
Had to wait short time, but they give you a menu and a pen while you wait and you can order from the queue. Food arrived promptly and tea refilled constantly. Seemed to be small servings but tasty and enjoyed it.
5
Crunchy cucumbers in spicy sauce and oriental salad refreshing. New noodle dish with spicy sauce....quite spicy...but great. Surprisingly hot and spicy thai soup, hot in temperature but not in spice. Dumplings great and enjoyed by one and all. Expect to queue for 20-30 minutes. Whilst waiting enjoy watching the dumplings being prepared and prepare your order sheet. 56 sgd for family of four with two lots dumplings,large soup, two salads, rice, noodles and glasses water. Beer is about 9 sgd per glass
5
I bring all international guests there because I know they'll love it, and most importantly, I'll actually have something good to eat too. I've never left disappointed.Some dishes I recommend: dumplings in chilli oil and vinegar their famous pork (or pork with vege) dumplingschilli crab dumplingsoriental saladcentury egg with gingerPlus the drinks are all of high quality too.The restaurant is always very busy but they work really fast and you get fed in no time at all. Always recommend
5
I love love love Din Tai Fung. When Im in Europe at least once a week Im thinking that I would love to go there for a lunch. The best one is in Kuala Lumpur in the Pavilion but the ones in Singapore are also pretty good
5
Loved it. Had to wait for our number to be called, but about 15 minutes of deciding what to order was useful! So fresh, so delicious, so hard to choose. Good value. Busy.
4
We enjoyed DinTai Fung so much we came back the next day to try other dishes. Loved the dumplings, the rice cakes, and the prawns with peaches & leeches. We will be back next time in Singapore or other locations.
5
Visited here when staying at Marina Bay Sands for a night and enjoyed a lovely meal here, including trying the dim sum. The sweet and sour pork was very nice and the atmosphere was pleasant.
4
Especially loved the chicken soup with noodles. Almost close to home cooked!! The fried sprouts with garlic is simply charming, not over cooked.
3
I am a Din Tai Fung fan, having been to this chain in Taiwan, Australia, and Hong Kong. This one lacked the style and menu range of the others, and was twice the price.
4
Ate here twice in May 2013. Yes there is always a queue - we waited 15 minutes. But it is well worth the wait. You can watch the dumplings being made while you wait! The dumplings and wontons are fabulous. Service is quick.
3
Like its branches all over the world, this one serves fresh dumplings. We were there in late weekday evening and it's still very crowded. Got to wait for the number to be called. Service from the kitchen was very efficient and the food order could be served in 10 - 15 minutes. Recommedations would be (a) the dumplings with minced meat and juice (beware, the juice could be quite hot), (b) the beef noodle in a very rich beef broth that you would like to finish to the last drop, and (c) pork served with minced garlic. Price is reasonable though a bit higher than its branches in Hong Kong.One thing to note: Stay close to the receptionist because when getting near to the shop's closing time, she may not entertain your reservation unless you keep a close watch. That happened to us and I had to raise my voice to get in. What's frustrating is that once got in, we found quite a number of empty tables just sitting there!
4
Fresh ( you can watch everything being made) dumplings and steamed buns. Really lovely- great quality ingredients. Kids loved their chicken noodle soup and the drunken chicken was melt in the mouth delicious. The vegetarian steamed buns were amazing.A large frenetic dining space- you wait until your number is called to be seated then mark off your food choices on a menu list. Don't worry if you under order you can always add more on later.Kids high chairs and plastic plates etc available
4
Now, I wasnt able to compare the dim sum and other chinese food here with other restaurants in the Singapore. But for the Shoppes at Marina Bay, this place was worth the wait. I had the truffle dim sum, the stuffed peppers, the pea shoots, the pork and chili crab steamed bun and the pork dim sum. Everything was fresh and handmade. Great choice for lunch or dinner while shopping
1
I got to DTF branches all over the island, and I've usually had pretty good luck. The food is always excellent--no complaints there. But this was the worst service I've had in any restaurant in Singapore during my 2 years of living here. We arrived at 6pm, left at 7:30. Early enough for dinner so that there shouldn't have been a problem. 1. We asked for 6 papers to expedite checkout and make things easier. She brought us 1. We asked again for 6. She brought us one more. We asked for 6. She brought us 1 more. So at the end, with a group of six people, we only had 3 order forms. This does not work with bigger groups--you have to pay when you leave, so you can't settle the bill at the table so easily. Why would she not just bring us 6, as we asked 3 times? 2. No water refills. Ridiculous. 3. We wanted to order more food and it was a FIASCO. They were rude about it. They would not bring us another paper, so we marked on our previous papers. Then when we tried to turn in the order, our server huffed away and came back and threw at paper at us. Then, someone else came by and told us it would be an extra 20minutes for dumplings. We had theater at 8, so that was a deal breaker. Seemed like they were really understaffed and under motivated. Bad bad experience. I honestly don't know when I'm going to feel up to going back to any DTF for a while. I left there frazzled and annoyed. Not the way you want to feel before theater
4
Serving food was a little late but food was tasteful!
But server kept speaking Chinese because they thought we were Chinese...Also they led us to very small table even though we were just two.
5
Great service out of all the DTF's and the food was divine as per usual. Only thing,,,long wait times. It is so worth it!
4
For about same price as the food courts there, just go DTF.
Long queue but efficient enough. Food of usual standard as other branches. Service prompt but not awe inspiring.
4
Great easy quick delicious food which leaves you wanting more without the horrible full feeling. You can see right into the clean kitchen watching the chefs cook up a storm.
5
I love their dumplings, and their steamed truffle dumplings are just fantastic. Always use their menu with the pictures to make sure you get the right meal...
5
I ate there twice on a five day trip. Both times were delicious, service was great and food was quick.
5
The consistency of quality among the Din Tai Fung outlets is just great. This particular outlet is a breathe of fresh air in Marina Bay Sands offering down to earth food, compared to the pretentious stuff that abound in this mall
5
We had heard that the food was good at these chains, so we tried the dumplings on night as a take awya order. Needless to say they were awesome. Get there early though as they may run out of your favorite!
5
Great restaurant in every location around the world it maintains high quality standards and the menu represents adequately the dumplings experience you can have in the best Chinese restaurants.Unfortunately at the MBS location there are always many customers and you might end up queuing for 1h
2
Ding Tai Fung, a good restauarnt in Taiwan, famed for its Xiao Long pau. But it has become so commercialised that the food just tastes good, but without soul. Service is still prompt (not good, just friendly and prompt). But the food is although good, is still lacking. For Xiao Long Pao lovers, there is a good Xiao Long Pau shop at Tiong Bahru in Redhill hawker centre across the road from Redhill MRT. The Xiao long pau there is 1/3 of the price of DTF and taste as good if not better, with lotsa of soupy fillings. DTF, a chinese fast food chain....
5
Good food, erratic service but all done to a successful formula.
Be prepared to use chopsticks - knives and forks were not on offer.
5
Great food and variety. Their dimsums are a treat. Even have vegetarian option in dim sums. Very hygienic and you can even watch dim sums being prepared in their open kitchen.
4
It is really best place to have dumpling in Singapore. I will recommend to everyone visiting Singapore, have one visit to this place, you will love it. They have several branch in Singapore
5
The BEST Dumplings ever!! Go with a group and try everything! Chicken soup... AWESOME!!! Dumplings in Black Vinegar and Chilli... AWESOME!! Can't go wrong!
5
The best dumplings ever, to a very affordable price.
Great service, great choice, great place.
Just make sure that you have enough time, as you might have to wait between 15 - 30 min before getting a table. But it is definitly worth
5
This famous dim sum chain is as good as they rave about. Really delicious. Quite pricey but the food is so good.
3
Went here as saw all the rave reviews, very popular had 20 min wait for table, had to order before you even got inside to speed things up. In and out in before you can blink, except they forgot one of our dishes! Would not go again
4
We love Din Tai Fung, so were very happy to (unexpectedly) find one while we were walking through Marina Bay mall.The wait was 60 minutes. So what. We went shopping and came back.Unfortunately - when we sat down, we found out that they have run out of our favourite dumplings. There were no more chicken dumplings. No more vegetarian dumplings. No more fragrant peanut dumplings. Boo.The food that we ordered was delicious (esp. shrimp dumplings) and the prices very good (20-25 SGD pp). But we were slighly disappointed in limited choice of their signature dishes
3
DTF is famous for its dumplings (xiaolongbao), and the quality is consistent among its branches. It's authenticity is second to none in a multi chain restaurant. The biggest disappointment at this branch is the constant error made by its staff. Our order was taken on the order pad and qty circled and read back to us, however we were sent an extra dish, when we queried and rectified it, we were then sent one less dish. During this time, the dishes handed to tables next to ours were not theirs and the staff serving looked lost to which table had which dishes. Please improve communication and attentiveness of your staff!!
5
the restaurant is located at Marina Bay Sands carousel and if you go there after 8PM you'll see a long line outside. but waiting is worth it.. usually in 15 minutes you'll have your seat. While you are waiting, you can already check the menu and write what you want to eat. The service is great, hot green tea is for free, and the waitress are realy nice. And most important.. the food is amazing! I've ever tried a so delicious dumplings before. Also, rice and noodels are good
3
I've always liked DTF, but Nanxiang Steamed Bun is just better, and there is one in Singapore (granted not terrible close to Marina Bay Sands, but still everything is relatively close in S'pore!).
5
They have this new chicken soup that is a must try. It uses the truffle mushroom and the soup is so smooth and gives you the energy.
5
Good spot for a reasonably priced business lunch: mall location means less formal than other options. Dim sum was top notch!
5
It's a food chain restaurant serving dim sum, fried rice, noodles, desserts n stuff. There's one in the Gardens KL too. It offers a wide variety of food n all tasted great. I like the cute little steamed dumplings best that I wouldn't want to go without..so's the hot papaya white fungus dessert! It's worth a try n you'd find yourself end up addicted! But don't let the queue deter you
4
great value. family of 4 can eat up to the limit for less than 100SGD. everything we tried (signature dishes) was very tasty. the ambience and service could be better. they have huge turnover and probably this is way they do not care that much anymore
5
I have been to Din Tai Fung in Taipei, Tokyo, Beijing and now Singapore and I'm amazed how consistent they are in delivering quality. The restaurants are always busy and no place for romantic dinners, but the service is friendly and efficient and the food is delicious. For those foreigners who are a little scared of Chinese food (I know surprisingly many), Din Tai Fung is a safe bet as there is rarely anything on the menu a Western palate would not like. Give it a try and become a fan
4
Food is amazing but the MBS restaurant is so busy that it is frenetic. And the service matches the craziness ie you have to order outside as waiting. There are many other locations and recommend you go there. For example in Marina Link just 10 mins walk away and they give you a menu at your table and you can relax without any pressure to make way for queuing people out the front. And your tea gets topped up regularly and they ask if you want more rather than having to use a buzzer for service. The food is very consistent across all locations. Very yummy
5
My husband and I had eyed this place off a few nights and it was always so busy. We decided togive it a try and were not disappointed. YOu order while waiting to be called for your table so this saves time when you get in. Everythign was so good and a local old guy was laughing at the way I was eating my Xiao Long Bao. I could wait to get the first one in and forgot to suck the soup out first, he took greta delight in telling his table how stupid I was. Wish Din Tai Fung was here in Melbourne
4
This restaurant expects to be packed and have a queue waiting to get in. You book a table and order you food while waiting for you table. We had a 20 minutes wait and the food was well worth it. The meat soup noodles was delicious, the meat was really tender and melts in your mouth, the soup was lovely and not too rich, while the noodles were just the right texture. The Dumplings matched what I had in Shanghai. Worth the wait
5
We knew we were in for a great food experience because of the crowds outside. But the line moved very.quickly. There are big windows so you can watch the food being prepared. We were given an order form/menu while in line so had made all of our decisions by the time we sat down. We are vegetarians and ordered every vegetarian item on the menu. Everything was delicious and it was a great Chinese experience in a city where it seems that western food is what is most prolific
3
But I like the taste of original restaurant in Taipei better. Everything is a little bit on the bland side
5
We always found ourselves coming back to this restaurant in our recent short stay in Singapore. They always found us a table despite being obviously busy and us having a small baby with us. Very impressive. The dumplings were amazing
3
If you are looking for authentic chinese food and amazing dumplings - this is the place to go . The food is really good and the ambience adds to the whole experience. However the meal can work out to be pricy .
4
I really enjoy the place. The dumplings are so good, fresh, juicy and the service so well organinsed that for sure I will come back again. Cost around SGD35 per person.
5
Crowds hang around outside, people take photos of the chefs rolling out the dough and making dumplings, a lady stands there yelling table numbers out - totally worth it! So yummy. Just realised Din Tai is a chain and 1 michelin starred! AND TOTALLY affordable food, you have to complete your own order form, and you're left thinking, what is going on... totally worth it
3
Fabulous menu, good ambience, pleasant staff,,,etc etc everything that you would expect from a very popular restaurant you will get here, except for one minor glitch....you may not get what you want from their menu. In our short stay in Singapore we tried twice but met the same fate....we did not get what we wanted both times. Either they step up their kitchen to try and dish out more of their popular dishes or have some early warning system to let diners know of the impending disaster before they settle down for a meal. Anyways, i think their product is good, they have a good name for the quality stuff they dole out, so hoping that as soon as they can step up their 'kitchen capability' one can move them to a 5
3
I'm a big fan of Din Tai Fung but for some reason, this one in MBS is not at par with the ones in Paragon and Raffles. The food came cold and not as delicious. I tolerate the rude service and the fact that none of the servers can understand English because of the quality of the food is really good but the one in MBS did not overcome these nuances. So I'll stick to the ones in Paragon and Raffles..
5
I'm a huge fan of dumplings and when I heard this restaurant was voted the best in the world I had to check it out. We dined here twice (both times for lunch) and the dumplings were excellent. Everything tasted light and fresh. The ordering system can be confusing, as you fill out a order form before you are given a table. this ensures that the service is efficient.
5
Dumpling legends. Stumbled across this place in the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre, turns out it is a hugely successful international dumpling restaurant chain.Xiao long bao is there thing, and they do them well.Had the truffle xiao long bao on special while we were there. Fantastic.Awesome value. Paid about $100 SGD for huge feed with glass of wine and a beer.If you want dumplings I couldn't recommend this place more highly.They do a few other chinese favourites too
5
Healthy, Value for money, Great Ambience. They have many outlets in Singapore but quality is consistent. They can be addictive and I can go everyday to eat there if they reduce the prices a bit. But they are very reasonable in price for occassional eating out
5
Been to Din Tai Fung in Hongkong and always amazes me everytime! The food is always good! I tried here in Singapore at the Shoppes and yes, Din Tai Fung always meet my expectations. I must say, wherever the branch is, they are consistent! Kudos!
5
Fantastic food! We enjoyed it so much we went back again! Very fresh food, very clean restaurant, attentive and friendly staff . The prices were very reasonable. Would most definitely recommend people to eat here!
4
Just like the ones in Sydney. Always packed,Great yum cha ish, fast paced vibe, delicious dumplings and good value. Lots of noisy chattering and eating. Love it.
5
Their xiao long pao was divine! I really loved it. Although it was a bit pricy it was worth it. I loved every bite of it!
3
We ordered various dumplings and also a chicken noodle soup here.The crab dumplings were not bad, the skin was very thin but the taste felt quite average.We also ordered some glutinous rice dumplings which looked beautiful but lacked a little salt and seasoning.The chicken noodle soup was nice however the chicken meat was dry and tough.Overall the experience felt quite average
5
I have made it a point to eat here every time I am in Singapore. Every thing I have ever tried has been delicious. They are world famous for the pork dumplings and they never disappoint. I have also tried the dumpling with truffle inside and it was nice as well. The fried rice is so light and tasteful. My wife and I have tried different noodle and rice dishes and salads and we haven't found one that we didn't like. The prices are really low compared to everything else around at Marina Bay Sands. The service is quick, even if the restaurant is usually very full
5
On a trip to SG last February, and while waiting to be checked in our room at Marina Bay Sands, lunch was of course at Din Tai Fung. What else but good food with great service to calm down a family of travelers' nerves :)Am on an unofficial quest for the best xiao long baos, and I have to say, this takes the top spot.Service was great! With our then 1 and a half and a four year old, our utensils kept falling on the floor, and the staff always went over and replaced them even without us calling their attention.Hope DTF opens soon here in Manila
4
We tried the popular starter Oriental Salad in Special Vinegar Dressing, then the signature dish xiao long bao, Fried Rice with Shrimps & Eggs and Noodle soup with beef.Efficient service and the price are reasonable for a Michelin star awarded restaurant at Marina Bay Sands Mall
5
Amazing dim sum, great service. Went to this restaurant twice in a week and wasn't disappointed either time. Try the Shrimp pancake, Dan Dan Noodles, Steamed shrimp & pork dumplings and the Dumplings in the vinegar and chili sauce. You won't be disappointed. I might even go so far to say that iDin Tai Fung was better (in what they do) than Jumbo Seafood out on the East Coast Parkway... ;-
4
Din Tai Fung originated in Taiwan and I had the pleasure of trying this in Taiwan and Singapore (Paragon branch 5-6 years ago).So was pleasantly surprised to see this at MBS. They are famous for their Xiao Long Bao, and rightly so. I cannot have enough of it! Also tried their Century Egg with Garlic, and was very delighted in how it tasted, as they sort of put it in some kind of sweet sesame oil that matched the tastes perfectly.As with Taiwan food, they are famous for their fried pork chop, so ordered the Fried Rice with Porkchop and was not disappointed!If you are a fan of Xiao Long Bao, you should never miss this while in Singapore. They have branches all over the island.As I was getting ready to leave, I also saw they had on offer Xiao Long Bao infused with Truffle Oil. They said this is the Xiao Long Bao variant that they use to serve foreign dignitaries and important people in Taiwa
1
Words cannot describe the bliss of eating dumplings at this place we ate there 3 times..........highly recommended
5
It's a Michelinstar awarded restaurant and they serve the best xiaolongbao, the famous steamed buns. It's known to be a dumpling icon in Asia Pacific. The other menus are good as well. The only thing I hated is the long waiting time
4
My family love the dragon dumplings. But be prepared to wait during weekends. We waited for more than 45 minutes for a table. Service staff is friendly and efficient
5
very nice food, especially dim sums) often you need to stay in line to be seated, since it's popular place) in general, not expensive for such a class. worth visitting!
5
Fast, fresh, reliable and tasty. You will want to go back again and again.
5
This is a successful chain of restaurants that unlike most chains keeps quality high! In fact it even got a well deserved Michelin star. You can watch the cooks prepare dim sum through a glass window, half a dozen guys working feverishly to roll, fill and steam the stuff. We were lucky to get seated fast but be ready to wait especially on a weekend night. Drunken chicken was good, but crab cake was excellent. So was everything else really. Service was fast and efficient. At some 40 $S per person with beer this was money well spent
4
I have no long queue because i arrived at 11 am. It is good value restaurant and xiao long pao is very delicious and two thumbs up. Prawns Salad with lychee is delicious. Lastly, I was surprised with the toothpicks in this restaurant , it is so special design and different from others
4
What I would have expected from a Din Tai Fung restaurant...good food, long queue. But luckily for us, we didn't have to queue, straight to the table within five seconds! The food was exceptionally good, love the xiao long bao and deep fried marinated pork chop. Definitely come here again whenever I am in the city
5
I understand that this chain of restaurants has been awarded a Michelin Star. This gives some confidence that the food on offer will be good, and we were not disappointed. The range of dumplings and other items on the menu is extensive, the quality is excellent, and the service is very attentive. What a refreshing change to eat somewhere in Singapore where the customer is actually valued, and is appreciated. This is something severely lacking in many restaurants in the city now.A great place to eat, reasonably priced, and such wonderful food, top marks!
4
We dined here twice. In and out in 20 minutes. Dumplings are fresh (you can see them being made in the window) are good especially the chicken ones that have soup inside them.One word of warning, check with the hostess at the front to see if there are any items not available. We left once because our favorite chicken dumplings and the prawn and goude dumplings were off
