A little gem hidden in an eclectic boutique hotel serving impressive modern French cuisine at reasonable prices.

This is an amazing little French resturant in Little India. The food is outstanding and it’s very reasonably priced. It’s easily accessible at Little India MRT. Will be back!!

Service was great and I love the ambience too! Connect their decoration with the Little India style which makes the French restaurant really special especially I’ve to take out the menu from the basket which I’ve never had such dining experience in my life!

With no lack of excellent restaurants in Singapore, it's a delight to find one with such exceptional food. The service was very attentive, the ambience a bit quirky but the food blew us away. We had Kohlrabi Salad and Smoked Sea Bream for appetizers and they had us salivating with anticipation for the main course. When it arrived the French Sea Bass and the Sauteed Squid with Garlic did not disappoint..au contraire..they were prepared to perfection, made from the freshest ingredients, presented artistically...and seriously appreciated. The Macaron dessert was scrumptious. The kitchen is justifiably proud of this signature dessert. Overall, a relaxed, delicious and memorable dining experience. We noted that there are vegan options for those who require them

It was an interesting experience. The restaurant is set within the Wander Lust hotel, and has an eclectic collection of furniture, including a barber’s chair, a small pool table and a bar setup. Service was warm and friendly, and the dishes came out at a good pace, and were beautifully plated.We began with the raw smoked foie gras and braised octopus salad. The foie gras was an interesting texture, but we found the octopus to be a little on the tough/chewy side. Our mains were chicken breast and smoked Australian strip loin. The chicken was nicely seared but parts of it were on the dry side. With the beef dish, many diners were a little perplexed when their plates arrived at the table, as there was no sign of the meat. The staff then bring a Dutch oven and then present the meat with a flourish. Smoked with hay - yes, hay - the strip loin had lots of flavour and was my wife’s fave dish of the evening.For desserts, we went with the recommended chocolate biscuit and the macaroon. The chocolate biscuit was very good, with a nice balance of sweetness and tart, and was light. We really enjoyed the vanilla ice cream too. My wife, who is a chocolate fan, liked the macaroon, but I found the cocoa ice cream to be a tad heavy.Overall, it was an excellent experience

I went for the 3rd edition of the jazz concert to find out that the price of the tocken went up in 2 months from 6sgd to 10sgd. So in the end, we paid 2 tockens = 20sgd for a glass of wine, half empty, the same price for a mojito and 1 tocken=10 sgd for a lousy coconut icecream. who do they take people for????

A very unassuming place, cozy and serve one of the best food... Chef Jeremy despite an Executive Chef in Michelin 1 even 2 restaurants, is so friendly and his food is the best I’ve had this Christmas season! Brought a group of friends and they all echo the same!

Four of us recently went to Audace for dinner thinking we were going for just a regular french meal, but were pleasantly surprised. The menu may look a little underwhelming but like another reviewer said, it does cover the bases. My dinner companions were raving about the bread even before we made it to the appetisers! Ingredients were fresh and the cooking/presentation was creative. We really enjoyed the oysters and the foie gras (loved it, the eel added a twist!) from the appetisers section. For mains, we went for the beef (sea urchin+shitake mushrooms=yum) and duck (excellent with the pumpkin and roasted pumpkin seeds). If you like cheese, you have to try the Saint Felicien cheese which my companions promptly cleaned out. For desserts, we had the Macaron and the Praline Powder with Matcha Tea but I wasnt as blown away compared to the appetisers/mains. Overall, prices were reasonable for the quality of food, atmosphere is more casual. We will definitely be back to try the omakase menu next time... given the chef does regularly update the menu according to the season/ingredients

Hi everyone,Originally French, It’s been now 7 years that I am in Asia. Audace is one of the most delightful gastro i have done around. Moreover it is super affordable actually cheaper that most of the average restaurant in Singapore. Cherry on the cake the chief, Jeremy (one star Michelin btw), it is super accessible.Go for it, it is a no brainer

Limited menu, but covers enough bases to satisfy most. Preparation, innovation, and presentation all push on first tier French standards. No, its not cheap, but it is not obviously expensive for the quality, sophistication, and good portion sizes. I can think of quite a few restaurants that have charged me a good bit more for less food that was much less enjoyable. The smoked raw foie gras and eel was a really interesting combination of flavors and a welcome new take on foie. The strip loin exceeded my expectations. The partnering sauces were interesting and well executed, the steak was very well cooked (I would have given it another hour sous vide, but I that reveals a preference for very tender beef that some might describe as insufficiently textured), and the quantity was such that i was actually full after these two courses, particularly after finishing the accompanying black polenta.My main complaint is that service, although very friendly, is a bit amateur. Not strictly bad or such that it would spoil the meal, just a bit below the quality of the food in terms of attentiveness.I'm going back soon

Great food and service, discovery menu was good value (decent sized plates) but overall bill but quite high!
5
Audace's food is great and not too expensive for a French restaurant.
I had for the 4-course discovery menu. Perhaps my favourite item of the evening was the fish with broccoli, broccoli puree, and lemon sauce - lots of flavours, textures, and nutritionally balanced.
5
Fantastic place yet completely empty - maybe as it’s off the beaten path. Pork belly was really great because it had been marinated with a lot of herbs so it was very fragrant. Will come again

Ambience was fantastic, service was awesome, and the food was so delicious. So glad I chose this place to celebrate a birthday, would definitely go back!

I attended a wine dinner held here a few days ago. The food was simply delicious and the wine carefully curated. The service was also very attentive. Its french fusion and quite delicious. Would highly recommend.

Amazing food, cool vibe, great service.
Great for romantic dinner or evening with friends. My favourites: beef striploin and black polenta side dish.

Went to celebrate mum's birthday. This is our first time here though I used to go Cocotte (which Audace has replaced). The menu is rather limited but they switched the items quite frequently. We tried 3 of their appetizers - braised octopus, tempura prawns and foie gras. All 3 were great. For mains, we had the striploin beef, salmon and pork belly. The salmon and pork belly was alright but we strongly recommend the striploin beef, which was super yummy. The desserts were ok but servings were beautifully plated but small portions which I guess is typical French food? Would definitely come back again.

Chef Jeremy of Audace cooks authentic French food that taste like what you will get in France. His food brings me back to my stay in Europe. His use of herbs and other ingredients is so well balanced that each dish is delicious. I will definitely be eating here again
