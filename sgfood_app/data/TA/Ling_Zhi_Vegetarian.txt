Food is very tasty and there are a variety of vegetarian dishes. However, the service was slow as there were very few waitresses .

We went to Lingzhi Novena for the vegetarian buffet steamboat lunch but ended up with ala carte dishes because they looked so pretty.Most of the dishes were delicious and well presented. Of special mention is the asparagus which were done just right, jade green and crunchy. Tofu cubes were my dad's favourite, crusted with spices and soft on the inside. Of special mention is the horn which was smoky but not too oily. The double boiled coconut soup with guns was a big disappointment because the fig lends a slight sourish taste to the soup. I would avoid spending money on that next time.Friendly service and good explanation of the dishes. We were glad we didn't opt for the DIY steamboat which we can do ourselves anyway.Not cheap but the pretty dishes meant it is a nice place to bring overseas friends who are vegetarian and want something over than raw salads.Will visit again

You might have caught the snaking long queues over lunch as Lingzhi offers lunch bento (takeaway only) for just $5! With brown rice or beehoon, you can choose 3 other dishes to go with it (there are only 4 options though but usually quite yummy!). Curry vegetables available as a dish everyday

This restaurant is under Tong Le. $24.80++ vegetarian dinner buffet is definitely not worth it considering the type of food it serves. Refer to photos.Services are very slow and need to request them then they will do it. E.g. Clearing the table, refilling of soup. The good point is that they have a "template" to present the birthday cake.We will never go for their buffet anymore.However, we may try their Ala cart menu.

i guess there are the guys who do not want to eat meat and some who somehow do not eat meat for whatever reason and yet do not want to forget it.and then they go to such places where the cooking is not something driving the good of the vegetables, but spends efforts on mimicking meat dishes with... mostly mushrooms (satay, gong bao, la zi ji...)i am not going to say food was bad. just get mushrooms dishes prepared like chicken at the price of chicken. being in Singapore, there is no good offer of tofu. and vegi dishes are a bit limited.of course ,there is the hot pot which made the choice of all other tables except ours

This vegetarian restaurant is meant to be famous and was certainly recommended to us by Singaporeans. However, I have to say I was not overly impressed, but perhaps that is because I come from Vietnam which has spectacular vegetarian food. When in Singapore I would much rather be in a Din Tai Fung

This restaurant is a Chinese style vegetarian eatery located at level 3 next to the escalator of Velocity@Novena, which can be reached by red line Novena MRT station. It is in operation since 1991 & they have other outlet at Liat towers also & the chain is part of famous TungLok group. We went to this place because our guest who prefers veg stayed at Ibis Novena hotel at Balestier road, which is less than ten-minute walk, & the hotel provides complimentary shuttle for guests up to Novena square. They have two main dining options. Buffet from food kept at the entrance including steamboat choices & order from menu card. We opted for later version & settled for soup (spinach & hot & sour), fried brown rice with mixed vegetables, Hong Kong style fried noodles with Soya sauce, curry vegetable which is served with fried buns & Jasmine tea. We were given braised peanuts to munch on before the food. Between three of us this quantity turned out to be too much. The place was not very crowded as there are too many food options nearby. The restaurant sidewall is decorated with artificial radish tomato, green pepper & potato tubs, which look quite real from distance. Service staff is attentive, experienced & accommodative. They did not rush us out even after we were done with our dinner
