Repeated visits. They have 1 for 1 for their selected pasta and pizza on weekday lunch. Love all their pasta. Pizza serving size is huge and is good for sharing. The lava cake is simply irresistible!

Between the 4 of us we had 2 pastas, a pizza, and the steak special. Everyone was happy! Service was amazing - friendly and helpful, and always available at all the right times. Would definitely return to try their other pastas.

Hidden away in the northern hills of Seletar, there is pizza to warm the heart. A far remove from the over-laden monstrosities commercial fare, it's thin crust goodness, served with friendly and uncomplicated service. No pressure to over-order, and a simply homely decor to boot. We rounded off with tiramisu, which was pretty good, if not spectacular. HDB parking just outside the front door makes it convenient for the drivers. Bravo

It's easy to find out the reasons for raving reviews for this restaurant. Good food, checked. Warm and attentive service, checked. Cleanliness and ambience, checked. There was also live music when we were there for dinner on Friday evening. Seeing our child who's busy drawing, one of the waitresses kindly offered coloring paper and pencils without being asked. Our unfinished food (we over ordered) was packaged nicely too for take away.Thumbs up

We've been coming here since the day Peter set up shop and it's always a pleasure dining. Lunch offers fantastic one-for-one deals on appetizers (calamari, pumpkin soup), pastas and pizzas that draws estate residents, office types and military men in droves. In this economy, most other F&B outlets will have a jealous fit if they saw the crowds Pietro attracts! That said, the Vongole here is first class - delicious umami white wine broth and delectable clam morsels - and we always go for the pistachio and chocolate lava cakes. Peter, may your business long thrive here in Seletar Hills Estate! We love your being here

A nice little restaurant located in a private estate near a Catholic church. We were very surprised that they had live music and our 23 month old daughter enjoyed it totally! The food was really yummy. We ordered a pasta, a pizza and risotto. My hubby loved the risotto. I love the pasta. We also ordered the chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cake. I think it's a nice place for lunch as they do 1 for 1. Price is a little on the high side but we really enjoyed the live music on a Saturday evening..

The lunch deal is very worth: one for one for their main dishes from 1130-230 weekdays. Excellent portions and tastes fantastic. Service is great too. I am definitely coming back again. Try coming for lunch when it is not crowded and there is ample parkIng. Weekends can be too crowded.

Every once in a while, you find a restaurant where you feel like it's home. This place, for me, would be the equivalent of Cheers. So take my review with a pinch of salt cos it might be slightly coloured by my favouritism! ServiceThe service is attentive and friendly. The service crew like Wahab and Kate are always smiling, friendly, and ready to accommodate requests for special arrangements of food or drink. For guests with young children, the girls are always ready to entertain them, and I don't know how but still remain on top of things to perform their jobs well for all the guests. FoodWe've been going there since they opened, and since then they've changed their head chef, but while the menu food seems to have been refined for the better. Some dishes I've had and recommend:The chicken wings. The skin is crispy and the inside juicy and well-seasoned. You can ask for the sauce on the side if you prefer the chicken crispy. It's really quite delish!The calamari- yummy and al dente, and that tomato sauce dip... divine. They also have a grilled squid that is very, very nice.Pizzas are really good, thin crust, crispy, oven baked and made to order (you can watch the chef make your pizza at the pizza station). My favourite is the Parma ham pizza which also comes with a heathy generous serving of rocket. I've had the mushroom pizza before... it's nice too, but a bit on the tomatoey side for me (but that's up to your persona taste).My go-to pastas are the squid ink pasta, the prawn aglio olio and the vongole. The vongole was slightly on the oily side but still very tasty. Pasta is al dente, all the clams were cooked, and tastes even better with extra chilli padi!For those who drink, the wine portions are ridiculously huge, compared to some wine places I've been to in the CBD. They even have a live acoustic duo on weekends who are pretty darn good (though the set up is a bit weird cos they're facing one table and the wall, when it would be better to face the majority of the diners (in front of the kitchen). And very importantly for any f & b establishment, the toilets are very very clean! Do tip if you enjoyed the experience and appreciated the service :) I will definitely keep going back to Pietro's

Pietro is located in a mature estate as well as near a church. It is well patronised as the food is fairly good and the staff friendly. It is especially convenient as I love close by in an estate that has only a few limited dining options. Prices as pretty much standard though veering a little towards the higher side. Wines are also good with a wide selection

My hubby wanted a different celebration for our wedding anniversary. He came here before for his lunch and said that this was nice. He booked the dinner for us. The food are all nice and when they know that we are celebrating our 18th wedding anniversary, they gave us a complimentary cake. The cake is really nice too! We really enjoyed the great food, great service and great ambience with live band somemore. Thanks for the team that serve us well. You have the best smile on your face. We give all of you a thumb up! This place need to reserve as fully crowded during weekends

Went here for the first time after being to Singapore for many year. I was not disappointed. The pizza was really good. The restaurant is in a small location. nothing fancy, but the food is good

Pietro Ristorante is an Italian Restaurant outside the City. Nice setting and good tasty food. Service is Ok and price on the medium range

Other than spaghetti, they have an oven for pizza as well. Recommend to go during lunch on weekdays as there are some meals 1 for 1 deal. Nice taste and presentation. Recommend starter of ham and cantaloupe

Worth the price at 1-for-1 on weekdays, but I'm sorry to say the pasta was honestly quite disappointing. Maybe I'll try the pizzas next time. They looked better.

Great tasting food! Good 1 for 1 lunch options too. Prices are slightly on the higher side but if the budget is OK, the food will meet your standards too

Depends what you are looking for in Italian food... There is a live band here of you fancy ...This is in a small residential area in Yio Chu Kang, Singapore.Chefs seem to be locals, no Italians , but super friendly Philippines service staff! -thanks v much . Ambience : unsure..... Old teak looking tables and chAirs with live bank singing on a small stage ( tonight is Saturday) .Food: salty Ravioli for my husband's , my Gnocchislla Bava was over cooked ,, too soft . We sent back for redoing the Ravioli ...Chefs seemed unhappy as we could see the kitchen from the divider glass window...Staff : attentive and friendly -Philippinos of course ! Value of money : 2adults, 2 pre teen kids, 4 pasta dishes , 1 soup , 2 glasses red wine = $157 . I would rate 3/ 10 for this

I have tasted my pizzas in Singapore and I think it is by far the best I have eaten. This thin crust pizza is authentic. The service was good. Too bad there was no freshly made fettuccine available today.would definitely come back again. There is also 1 for 1 meals for lunches.

Extensive menu spanning antipasto, pasta, pizza, mains and dessert. Many 1 for 1 options which bodes well for the wallet. Quality and portioning adequate. Choice of indoor or Al Fresca dining. Warm hospitable service staff. Summing up, if you have a craving for good Italian food and you're in this part of the island, this is the place to be at

Lots of 1for 1 offer on the menu which is easy to decide. But the pasta I order with cheese has little ingredients only 2 prawn and 2 mussels. Dessert is expensive but taste good.Order 3 type of pizza it was very goodWorth a visit for Italian food. The chef is local Peter neo

With my wife and my two sons, we've been there last Friday and had a good moment there, outside on the terrace.The service is really fast, incredibly friendly and efficient for Singapore, probably the best we have ever seen in 3 years and probably the main reason why we spent a so good moment there.We took 2 pizza, 1 rizzoto in squid ink, 2 Tiger, 2 coke and profiteroles. The food was good, and nearly all the plates came together which is not common in SG and really appreciable. When came the bill, there was a mistake of 50$ in it, and after correction the total price was still around 140$ which is expensive for such restaurant, that's why we did not give the highest note
