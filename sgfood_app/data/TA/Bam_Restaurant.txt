Great ambience and well maintained. Food exquisite and lovely sakes to match. Fresh and seasonal produce and ingredients are used to awe your senses
5
Excellent fine dine food with good service. Price is a bit steep for the portion served. Lunch menu is more value for money.
5
Great meal prepared by chef Pepe and his staff. Every dish is a pleasure for the eyes, the nose and finally for the palate. Superb food in a very nice location. The place to be for a high class tapas.

Wandered in for a pre-dinner drink by chance and what a pleasant surprise. Wife and I had the jamon with tomatoes and the padron peppers washed down with a wine glass full of medium sake. What a way to kick start a lovely evening. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we went back a few weeks later and had the tasting menu. Highly recommended
3
Went there as my brother highly recommended. Maybe the expectation was a bit high, it was alright. Japanese tapas, food is unusial. Price is reasonable, service is ok. Location is interesting. I would say try it if you have been to Singapore many times already and want to try something different . The most try is the charcoal pasta or sea urchin pasta
5
I ate here a month ago with a close friend. It turned out to be the best dinner i've had in Singapore. World class food. The head chef was extremely friendly, stopped by the table to chat about what the food. Service was on point. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants to have a special dinner
5
We had a wonderful meal there. In addition to the omakase set dinner, we ordered 2 tapas dishes. Portions are not large but we were full enough. Prices are steep. That's very good sake too. The only criticism by my wife was the dessert which she get didn't quite match the standard of the rest of the meal.
5
I really can’t believe how this place don’t get a star Michelin The lady chef lizi and her team really blow my mind one more time .Service team , elegant and eficience as always.I would describe all dishes I try , but they have so many ingredients that I don’t think I have enough text here I won’t stop coming back Thank you
5
The tasting menu was lovely, and we were content with the smallest (4-course) version. The sake pairings were great. Many of the dishes had recognizable ingredients or concepts from Spanish or Japanese cuisine, but it would be a mistake to call it Spanish-Japanese cuisine. It's creative cuisine
5
We have visited Bam on many occasions and our experience there has always been fantastic. Chef Pepe's cooking is creative and simply delicious and he creates new dishes all the time. On this occasion we had the 8 course degustation and every dish was beyond our expectation. I was especially impressed by his tuna Nouten dish which is the tuna meat found at the tip of the fish head - very precious and so tender. Service was attentive and tables were spread out and very comfortable. This was the first time we sat at the restaurant area as we were a big group. We normally sit by the counter area and watch the cooking action and chat with the chefs.
4
Interesting flavours from bold trials. Not all dishes were to my liking but executed well. Portions were small though, we needed to supplement our set lunches with additional tapas order. Chef was personable and greeted us cheerfully upon entrance. Service staff could learn from Chef.
5
lunch set at $40, top up with tofu and iberico appetizers to try other dishes . Love the light meals!
5
Awesome food. A culinary experience. And amazing service. Yes pricey but worth it for a treat! It's like watching a cooking show if you sit at the bar.
5
My husband and i are not experts on Japanese cuisine, so the chef's menu was perfect for us. we dis 4 courses, and each one was truly incredible. The interaction of the flavors amazing. We loved our experience at BAM and recommend it highly.
5
From the welcome to the end of your dinner the Food is out of this World. Great conbination of flavors. This is one of my meal this year ... Can wait to go back. Thank you Chef.
5
Excellent evening, high quality food and interesting fusion of Japanese and Spanish!! The service was really good, next time I would do the set menu with the sake matching! Would certainly go back!
5
What a great place this is! Owner Pepe (Born in Spain) cooks together with his very professionnel team the most delicious food.Sit at the bar and enjoy looking the professionel team preparing the dishes.Very nice to see that a very young but very accurate girl is leading the team!Drink a wonderful white wine from Spain or enjoy sipping from special sake.Pepe, we are already looking forward to coming back
5
Dinner at BAM! is an eclectic and delicious affair, and is an enigmatic combination of Japanese and European ingredients.Service is very good and the ambiance is great. The omakase-style degustation menu is one of the best dinners I have had in Singapore in all the years we've lived here -the combination of ingredients, textures and flavours is truly outstanding.And be sure to go for the sake pairing experience. A memorable dinner indeed.Very highly recommended. Not exactly cheap, but for the quality of the food and service, is about course on par
5
Yet another of Singapore's quality restaurants.In the CBD on Tras Street it has several excellent competitors nearby and so has to stay on top of its game.The theme is Spanish/Japanese and whether you have the tapas or the Omikase menu (or mix them) , you will find it a real treat.The atmosphere is calm with a good, not too loud soundtrack in the background - for a more real experience book a seat the bar in front of the open kitchen - the staff work with a steely professionalism producing their fare.My two favourites at the moment are the duck and water chestnuts dumpling (tasted like Christmas), and the ama ebi with green beans, creme freche and ponzu jelly.You can pair with sake if you like or there is an extensive wine list - of course in local style, this adds heavily to the bill.This isn't a cheap restaurant but is good value for the food it serves and well worth a visit.Book well in advance since it is popular
5
Had a great experience. Read somewhere that its a good option for vegetarians and I contacted the restaurant beforehand to confirm it indeed was. They sent me a menu 2 days before our reservation (they shop in local markets to get freshest produce, so menu changes) and it looked so good even I opted for it (I'm not vegetarian but my friend is). Service at restaurant was friendly and attentive. nice ambience. I enjoyed every dish we had. Very nice evening
5
Had set lunch which was excellent food at very reasonable price. Had the fish as main course which was well grilled and tasteful. The dessert was Michelin Star quality. The service attention was great!!
4
We came here for dinner celebrating birthday for one of our gang. We had the eight course Omakase meal, and had both sake and Pinot for the dinner. Service is great and we had good dining experience.
4
Was deciding between the tapas and the set lunch. Tapas sounded quite interesting. The oysters were huge and recommended as was the pineapple gazpacho- very unusual and refreshing. Cheese board a bit disappointing.
Service was efficient and friendly.
5
We had a great night at Bam! The food was exquisite and we definitely recommend the sake pairing - it was really great value. Our evening was made extra special by the fabulous waitstaff. 5 stars all round.
5
BAM! delivers the full fine dining experience without the stuffiness of white table cloth. The atmosphere and decor is casual chic, well train servers and meticulously prepared and yummy food. Our 6 course degustation expanded to 10+ courses with the amuse bouche and surprise anniversary dessert. Executive Chef even came by to talk to us.
5
Have always enjoyed the food at BAM and after a long overdue return, was welcomed to a newer, more sophisticated version. The cramped seating space is now morphed into a classy dinning space that welcomes couples and groups easily. Service was extremely attentive and friendly and the staff knowledgable of the menu and sake. The food also exhibited a depth of skill in the combination of ingredients and flavours. We had the 8 course -Portions are generous and each serving unique and different, and while originally the pricing seemed a bit expensive- the generous and quality of ingredients justified it. While i am not one for desserts, they were wonderful. There is an Omakase dessert menu that should be on the radar of everyone with a sweet tooth. Looking forward to going back with family and friends..soon!
5
Love this chic place with excellent food & service. Food is creative with a modern twist of fusion. The staff are well brief with the serving of the food & they are very jovial; makes one feel their service pairing is better than the sake pairing
5
Went there with colleagues as was early for meeting. Great service. Attentive and informative (they helped described every dish). Each dish was an interesting fusion of Japanese and let's say European as there were various styles used. Food came out at a nice pace. Star for me was the poached egg on top of the chorizo risotto. Definitely will be back when in the area.
4
great place for ambience, service and of course the food. wide selection of sake here.. and instead of pairing with japanese food.. chef takes a more spanish slant.they only have omakase menus available.... but a good deal is the mon nights' sake and tapas wine pairing course, for $48++ you get five tapas and five sakes..
5
So refreshing to have genuinely friendly smiling service staff to ensure a pleasant dining experience from start to finish. Many thanks to talented Chef Pepe for accommodating my temporary preggy belly food requirements. The food was artfully served and every bite was delicious! This was definitely one of my most memorable foodie experiences in Singapore! Thank you!
5
Madrid and Tokyo interwoven with the most wonderful tastebud stimulators. Hokkaido scallops (with CO2 frozen orange peel), suckling pig, pigeon - wonderful food; wonderful bill!
4
Very classy interior and very friendly attentive hosts. Portions are slightly small, feel free to order more than usual. Ambience is good. Enjoyed the dinner.
4
We were given a lovely table, we all loved the signature dish, kampong egg with the baby squid and the sake was simply delicious!! Will definitely repeat our visit!
5
Possible best roast pig ever. Best Spanish food outside Spain.
With a good mix of imported and local produce. Good value for set lunch.
4
Bam was great. Not only the food but the service was excellent as well which is not something you can always say in Singapore.The black squid ink rice was phenomenal. Some other reviewers comment on the prices - which is fair enough as it was a bit pricey but I think it was better than many of the more expensive places in town. Would I go back. Yes I think I would.

I had high hopes of BAM! Let me start with the bill and work backward for you. I should also tell you that we came as a party of 8 to review the establishment for a dining club. They did not make the grade.8 course - $170 withOUT drink. BAM! You have been taken for a ride. Meat dish - two slices of meetPea soup - two spoons of soup and a pod of peas.We were seriously going to phone for a McDonald's delivery to the restaurant the portion size was such an insult.Reviewers say this is authentic Japanese - it is not. It is absolutely not - service style, cooking technique, etc, is all not Japanese. I would say too, that it is nowhere near Spanish. I don't know what it was trying to be and that's the problem.Several of the dishes had issues with acidity and mixing of ingredients. As Gordon Ramsay would say "Damn - I really wanted that to be good".For example, the Japanese egg and chorizo. The sausage totally overtook the dish. The egg itself was flavorless. Apparently, Japan is meant to be the godsend country when it comes to eggs. Having lived there I would try to avoid products like this due to animal husbandry issues, however, in this case, the product added nothing.The internal ambiance is clearly a designer formula, now dated and no longer edgy. The Formica tables; service attempts to not change out cutlery between courses; the gimmick of serving low-to-mid range sake (don't be fooled by the price) in wine glasses... You can find far better establishments
5
Came here with family and their friends. We had a tasting menu. There were some gorgeous dishes here - especially the mushroom soup: its a mix of Asian and Spanish ideas served as tapas. It is interesting and delicious. Tricky to suggest a dish as their menu changes often but I'm reliably informed it is consistently splendid. Lovely venue, great vibe, friendly and attentive staff. If you're in Singapore - come here, eat, and have a lovely time
5
Bam! has become one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore. First visited as part of the EatSingapore book, but have been back a few times since. The food is very interesting and always delicious, and the wine is fairly reasonably priced (for Singapore!). The kitchen and waitstaff are very friendly and helpful, and the restaurant has a great lively vibe
4
Lovely ambience and some really explosive flavours. I found some of the dishes were slightly odd and didn't sit well on my pallet but others were stunning.The octopus was great... And the lobster I felt was strange and the bisque really not pleasant. Happy I cam
4
Had a farewell dinner for a colleague and we were one of the first customers. Manager took the time to explain menu. We over ordered as we didn't really understand the "2.5 portion" concept that he explained. Luckily we were able to cancel one of the dish. The dishes were good but just find that the flavours (citrus) were almost similar after a while. One of the guys server that brought us the bill made small talk with us. It made the atmosphere very home-like, as if we were long time customer. When they said "hope to see you again" and in my mind, I thought "yes I will".The only complaint will be the lightings. I thought it is a wee bit too bright for a dinner
5
Service, omniscience, food, drink... fantastic! More of an experience than a meal, staff so friendly! Highly recommend, expensive but worth it !!!
5
Bam is the best place to dine in Singapore. Food is amazing, Spanish wine great. Special big up for the mushroom soup!
4
Good variety of food, sake pairing was fantastic - though a tad bit too much. :)
Service was good, food delivery was at some point slow...
A very good overall experience!
5
Cannot recommend this place enough, we went on a night out as a two couple group and the level and quality of service, first off, is a high watermark for Singapore. Next up was the exemplary level of skill and finesse on display in every course consumed (we went for the tasting option) accompanied by some truly excellent top shelf sake. Bolt on the knowledgeable waiters/waitresses, the glorious banter being seated kitchen-side and the generous free tasters thrown our way and you have a culinary space worthy of a michelin star and then some.
5
This is a Michelin star restaurant- it is worth every penny!!!Exquisite food - sublime wine - intimate decor.Service - polite, informative and not pushy at all.Pepe - the executive chef is awesome. Location in Sing-City: perfect. Charming neighborhood. I will come again.Ps: they have wifi:-)
4
Been to Bam twice and both occasions it was very good food and service. Its a tapas type food with a Japanese twist to it and pairing with Sake makes it really interesting. The sakura prawns and the duck dumplings are divine so give it a try. Not cheap but worth it. The service is very attentive and can help with recommendations. Open kitchen concept makes it even more fun and some seats in the kitchen counter can keep you entertained if alone.
4
Tras St is actually an amazing street for foodies. The locale is filled with heritage and history and there’s plenty of restaurants and hidden gem. One of them is this like Sake Bar that is pretty awesome.At BAM, almost everything in their menu goes well with sake, and their certified resident sake sommeliers will not only pair your dishes with ample pours, but will show you how to make the most of it as well! There’s a huge sake collection sitting in the cellar and your head will spin from the choices on offer (and perhaps from all that sake
3
We went here for a date night on a Friday and really liked the ambiance, it felt like we were in Soho in Hong Kong, good vibe and energy. The menu was underwhelming as a "tapas" selection and the main dishes were not main dish sized so we ended up ordering quite a but (mind you we're not big eaters). I get the attempt at fusing Japanese and Spanish but They could have done a lot more with that theme than they did, it's really more continental with some Japanese names. Michelin star prices did not live up to my expectation for quality of food. We had quail ($66) and taberner ($98) which is already way up there in price but the portions were tapas sized even though supposed to be mains. The wines were priced at the high range compared to same bottles in other restaurants in Singapore, but great selection for sake and maybe it's better as a happy hour afterwork drinks with sake than sit down dinner. For the amount we spent per person we could have had a better, more satisfying meal at another top restaurant in Singapore. I don't regret going but won't go back
4
didnt expect much / think of much going into this restaurant. tried the rabbit and steak. not bad at all ! wine selection mediocre. service was friendly and attentive. Dishes themselves were good, but nothing extraordinary. I find the price for the food here high for what they were serving / quality of food but overall not a bad experience. If they lower the price would return
3
Came at the recommendation of a Friend who's a foodie. We ordered a couple of dishes at my friend's recommendation but the flavors are pretty normal to me though well presented and thought through. But I find the food lacking finesse. Perhaps it wasn't a great night for the kitchen cos my Friend who frequented the place said the same that it's not their usual standard. Sake was one of our favourites. We had a hanagaki and dassai 23..would have more if the food was more spectacular.
5
Deliciously well executed .
Service was attentive but not overbearing.
Abit on the pricey side. But worth the trip for special occasions.
4
Been going here once a month this last one year. Great food and service and every month there is something new on the menu.
5
Loved the food here at Bam! Dishes were nicely plated, great taste and good size for sharing. Always looking forward to bring friends and family here.
5
Nice food, friend staff, and nice n relaxing ambience. Highly recommended for couple and friends. The dinner set is value for money too.
5
For a lunch tête-à-tête it was the perfect venue. Food was great and they allowed sharing which was a big plus for us so that we could have a little more choice. Best of all they allowed us to stay on to finish off our wine. Had a great time and will return for sure
5
Been here several times, but it had been a while since the last time. They have expanded to occupy the adjacent shophouse, connected by a doorway. Existing counter still a bustling place to watch the chefs cook and plate the visually exciting dishes. The new area has a large bar, and quieter tables. Food - Spanish x Japanese - is still as inventive as ever; pair it with sake or the new extensive Spanish wine list. Superb food; will go back anytime
5
They have an option of a several courses meal - the Omakase menu and it's a great experience! Chef Pepe creates dishes based on your preference and ingredients available. And an a la carte. We tried different things and every time chefs managed to surprise us with the taste and a mix of ingredients used. To me, the ingredients are mainly from Japanese cuisine, but the dishes created - you cannot name it Spanish or European - it's unique! They have a stew of 21 veggies (not sure about the name, but you'll recognise it on the menu) - sounds very simple, but the way it's cooked it's just awesome - you can feel the taste of each and every ingredient!!!When you arrive - there is an open kitchen and the Chef and team are greeting you! The atmosphere is easy and friendly. You can sit at the bar and watch them cooking, talk to Chef Pepe, or choose a table where the team will also take care of you! It was the first place where waiters work as an invisible team, no mistakes, high class...Our best compliments and appreciation to Chef Pepe and the team
3
Went there for lunch with a friend and we were not planning on spending a dinner average check over lunch but more so getting a good value for money set lunch (as we eat out everyday in the area). The associates approached us and were very nice and friendly, however, they only gave us the a la carte menu and explained the favorites etc.. When they came back to take the order we asked how many dishes (sharing style) we should order for the two of us. The team replied 5-6 to start with. Looking at the pricing per plate we thought that would become a rather pricey lunch and we were both not in the mood to for that kind of experience. We were wondering if we should excuse ourselves for making a wrong choice of venue for our catch-up lunch but since the napkins and glasses were now used, we felt that it would be inappropriate to stand up and walk out of the restaurant. We decided to get back to our selection of 5 plates and the team suddenly presented us a separate set lunch, 3 courses, S$40 and very attractive. To cut the story short, we had the set, it was very good and the chef added an additional warm appetizer which was delicious, just that I really felt tricked as they tried to make us spend the full a la carte prices without even suggesting there was a great value for money alternative. Very sad that the team reacted that way as the food is very good but there are so many alternatives for lunch in this area with value for money propositions that I will skip Bam! for lunch moving forward
5
Being recommended by a friend this stylish restaurant turned out to be a true experience! The spanish chef was preparing us a degustation menu, which was delicious!! Service was a bit chaotic, but friendly and polite.The chef was talking to each table after finishing orders, so we had the chance to have an interesting talk with him.Prices were - as usual for Singaporian restaurants - very pricey for us Europeans, but we very enjoyed our evening at Bam
5
Bam is a tapas restaurant with a Japanese twist.Chef Pepe produces traditional high standard tapas but both the Japanese twist such as sake foam or tempura makes for a superb mix of textures and flavours whether meat or fish.The suckling pig is a must but order early since it takes a while but definitely worth it.The gazpacho has the most intense flavour I have ever experienced.Another part of the Japanese side here is the sake pairings. Let the staff guide you and you will not be disappointed.There is a fine list of Spanish wines as well , but start with a house sake and then move on ......A first rate experience
4
Perfect for business dinner, will recommend to my colleagues and friends. I will definitely book this place again.
5
Had dinner here last night and is was awesome! Favorsome and nicely plate! Good selections of Spanish wine and service are friendly! Must try is their cold cappelini!! And suckling pig!!
4
Great food, great service but a tad too pricey. Be prepared to spend if you want a full meal at BAM.
5
Awesome place to go.... Japanese ingredients with Spanish manner.... stylish restaurant with modern sake and vintage French High-End R/Wines.....
5
Bam! Is the best address in Singapore. We have been there probably around 10 times (couple, or with friends) and the experience is consistently amazing. It starts with great service. The second time we went, our favorite waiter remembered not only us, but also remembered which wine we took ! His advice have always been good. The wine list is good, and well priced. Good selection of Spanish wines. We tried the sake pairing menu once but we are not fans of sake so hard to judge. The food is really good. Great products, presented with style and menu changes very often. Some highlights are the duck gyoza or burrata pastas. The restaurant is definitely better than a lot of 1 or 2 Michelin stars restaurant and has kept quality standards at the highest and has converted into our favorite restaurant in Singapore
5
Best food, best service, best atmosphereDefinitely my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Food is awesome, creative and TASTY ! No BS here, high quality products cooked in the best way with attentive and friendly service. Wine list is great and affordable with always good advice from the sommelier. Just go and enjoy the ride. Of course all that has a price but you will be happy to pay it after those kind of great night. Thanks BAM 
5
Brilliant dinner last night . Pepe is a masterful chef and his first star will surely come soon. The expanded space is a good addition though I prefer to sit at the counter and watch the team in action. Good service , decent wine list . a tad pricey but a great place for a special occasion or not as they case may be. one small complaint : is about the noise level in restaurant it was quite high due to some boorish types with broker laughs who made our evening slightly less enjoyable than it should have been. maybe some acoustic dampening would help. :
4
Fusion food at its best, with thoughtful blending of the finest ingredients. Chef Pepe has a knack of making a simple dish into an art form - the ocean trout with miso hollandaise and trumpet mushrooms was pretty on the plate, a delight on the taste bud. The ambience was convivial and service impeccable
5
Love it. Was not sure what to expect... Spanish chef, jap Izakaya style cuisine, sake pairing. Refreshing experience. Everything I ate was good to excellent. Every pairing sake was interesting. I had the omakase menu (which means up to the chef) while my dining partner had a 3 course menu. The difference is that the a la carte portion was normal, whereas each dish under the omakase menu was a lot smalller but no compromise in terms of taste, quality and presentation. We will def go back again and next time with more friends! Thank you for a wonderfully delicioso dinner
4
Well plated and tasty tapas, modern take, more of a scene bar rather than a foodie place, pricey but a worthwhile experienceThe annoying part is that half the wine menu was not available or they were on the 'last bottle' which seemed to have left only wines from SGD500 upwards, not what I expect from a 'tapas' bar, regardless of its interpretation. Friendly service and buzzing atmosphere, its about enjoying the flavours and combinations not about eating. All in all a fun evening.
4
Our "Go-To" place for good food and wonderful service or just to watch the chefs at work over the counter. Chef Pepe and his team really work hard!
5
Why write 100 words to describe a Chef, food and Restaurant when you can use just one word. Orgasm! Do I need to say more?
1
Worse dining experience for the price we have paid. Poor space allocation and service. The guests were standing next to our table talking and laughing loudly and the waiter did not bother even when we feedback to them. Food wise was a average rating.

Well executed
Tasty
Fresh
Good ingredients
Friendly service
Impressed with consistency
Not too foamy

We were there at the end of August and I meant to write a review earlier but kept procrastinating. I was at a nearby restaurant this evening and passed by Bam! And that jolted and reminded me to finally get the review done!We were there on a Sat night in late Aug and were ushered to be seated bar counter. After being seated, no one took any notice of us for at least a good 10 minutes. We had to locate the menu on our own from somewhere around the counter. The place was busy but I didn't think it was that busy that someone could not at least have shown us the menu.We eventually got someone's attention and opted for the alacarte menu. We ordered the following: octopus, scallops, carabinero prawns, cold cappellini soup, celeriac & lobster soup, bouchot muscles and the 21 vegetables. The food was prettily decorated and served to us. The dishes were mostly alright but we were let down by the carabinero prawns. We thought they would be special but alas, tasted very ordinary despite the hefty price tag for a tiny little thing. The octopus was by far the best of the dishes as they were tender and delicious. We had sake to go along with the meal. Portions of food are smaller than what one would expect for the price charged.We then ordered two desserts - the steamed lemon cake and the gula Melaka ice cream. They were alright but not memorable. If you were to ask me whether I would jump at the chance to visit again, I would say no as the food was generally ok (except the prawns) but for the portions served, they were a tad too pricey in my opinion
4
A very cool chill place with the most amazing food ! very tasty , innovatively put together with great presentation. Chef a great guy and happy to hear feedback. service very crisp and pleasent . pricing wise not cheap but worrh it , watch out foe the wine as rhats where the price sting will come in.must book can get busy. have fun you wint regret 
5
The combination of fusion tapas prepared by expert Spanish chefs and a superb team served with cleverly paired Japanese sake is astonishingly good. The sake servings are more generous than the food servings, but it is all delicious. The lunch is great and superb value, the dinner is a bit more of an investment, but fantastic for a special occasion. I prefer to sit at the counter and watch the chefs in action preparing the dishes. Highly recommended
4
While the restaurant is compact, it's still conducive for our biz meeting cos the staff place us away from the other guests. The staff were attentive and top up our drinks and clear our plates swiftly. Dishes were interesting. Set lunch at $40++.They have a good selection of sake. On the pricey side though
5
My second time here and this place never fails to impress. This time I tried their omakase. One of my most favourite dish is their roasted suckling pig that has this layer of fat that was so pleasurable to eat as it melts in your mouth paired with the crunchy skin which was to die for. Their perfectly spiced octopus, hands down one of the best I've ever eaten because it is cooked so well, not a single bite was close to being chewy. There is nothing in their menu that I don't love. Each dish is so well thought of and well executed to perfection. Their waiters are so meticulous which made the whole dining experience just amazing. Definitely a place that I will visit again and again.
5
The service and the food was excellent. Delicate preparation to the pefection. This is the only restaurant that I ate every food that served in the plate. You get to see your food prepared in front of you. Thanks for Chef Pepe who let me have a taste of his favorite dish. Superb!!!This is my favorite restaurant in Singapore. Highly recommended! I would surely come back.
5
A fabulous evening from start to finish. We ordered set menu $128 along with a bottle of Malabrigo-all of it was divine. Will definitely be returning!
5
It was an 11 course dinner including 2 desserts! Top quality ingredients were used but the most memorable part was on the precision of cooking.
5
My 1st visit to bam tapas. Strongly recommended to try the Omakase.
Simply divine. Would love to try out other dishes as well. Interesting to see
Chef prepare the dishes in front of our eyes. Thumb up
5
A nice place for after work dinner n chill out. The food is fresh where chef specially prepare n cook. Need to make reservation as it is always full house.
5
We enjoyed the OMAKASE set menu (8 courses). Bravo Chef Pepe!:). We will definitely come back and recommend this cute restaurant to our friends!
5
This was a last min drop in just in the back of my mind near one of my offices. Counter top ring side seat. The food is off the graph and I do not say that lightly. The special of soft boiled egg chorizo and baby squid was to die for. The chefs favorite 21 vegetables in fois gras broth was sublime. Service is top flight the pricing is actually excellent and not lumpy at all. Absolutely fabulous.
5
We went for the Tapas menu paired with Sake - sounds odd but is wonderful and both myself and friend are Sake crazy so this was a new experience.The Sake choices actually weren't always to our liking but they were interesting and well chosen for the food which was spectacular. We learned a lot and our taste spuds had a ball! Every dish including the amuse bouche was incredible in presentation and flavour.Atmosphere is local, vibrant, noisy and crowded in this small interior which all combined to make a very enjoyable evening. Yes it is expensive but I can't wait to go back
5
Being able to see what is cooking in front of you and all the REAL quality ingredients turning into beautiful creation that allows your palate sensitivity to emerge. They deserve a 5 star.Each dish comes in food tasting size when you opt for omakese menu.

Came here with my family at the back of an excellent personal recommendation for a birthday celebration. Booked through Chope and highlight it is a birthday celebration. No birthday greetings, and as soon as we consumed our last order, waiter came to tell us second sitting has arrived and presented us with the bill. We didn't even finish our bottle of sake and had to adjourn to another restaurant for desserts
1
Chosen by a friend and I would never go back. Ate as a group of 8 people which should suit a Tapas place perfectly but we all left hungry and ended up a second meal - Korean hotpot afterwards on Tras Street!Cost was c.SGD 250 per person with some of their cheaper wine. Just 2 bottles between the group. The portions were tiny, so small that it was tough to cut up the meat / fish into bits that can be shared. We actually laughed when one dish came out due to just how small the portion was! Felt bad as it's not the waiter's fault.Food objectively is good quality but given the astronomical price, tiny portions and how we left necessitating a second dinner, I can only give this place one star
4
Nice set-up and good location with great food but quite pricey for what you get. All dishes were very tasteful and nicely plated. Service was good and attentive at all times.
4
Great wine and beef short ribs for dinner. Prompt service but unsmiling maybe because the place was too noisy
5
Had a great surprise when the chefs and staff sang Happy birthday and they were very attentive that they knew who the birthday girl was without asking.
Great service & great food!

I am a teetotaller. And I hate noise. What am I doing in this bar? For the excellent food. At lunch. The ingredients are super fresh and the cooking is par excellent. It is not a place for bringing high end clients but it is a place where you satisfy your gastronomical desires. It was recommended to me by a pal who is good at sniffing places which are diamonds in the rough. This is undoubtedly one of them. The lunch is excellent. It is worth every dime. The food, the service, the ambience. This restaurant would fly in a better location.

We stopped over in Singapore for about 5hrs and spent the majority of it here having what I'd rate as some of the best tapas I've ever tasted. Some family members living here advised this was their favourite and if did not disappoint. The food was delicious and creative in design. The staff were friendly and quick with no loss in service quality. I'd highly recommend visiting here if you have a chance

Having been here twice before without ever trying the food, it was time for another visit with the specific purpose of sampling the tapas menu. We ordered a selection of items from the menu, almost all of which were really very good. It's just that the servings were quite small in size, so we felt a little hungry at the end of the meal. Washed down with sake and some beers

I arrived early for my reservation and waiters were friendly and showed me my seat. I've read many reviews about the place and can't wait to experience it myself. I was impressed by the wide selection of sake and the waiter was helpful and helped me picked out a sake to my preference. I've ordered cold cepellil and was disappointed and both me and my friend thought it tasted blend. The stuff squid was cooked well and the squid was easy to bite in. The scallop was very average as there wasn't much of a truffle taste but the dish was overwhelmed by the cheese. I would have given feedback if a waiter were to ask about my food that night. Overall it was disappointing and definitely not worth the price. I would think twice about returning.

I've been meaning to try out this place for a while and was happy to book 2 seats on a Saturday night for my hubs' birthday celebration. We got the counter seats which was what we wanted so we could see the chefs in action. We went for the ala carte menu as our appetites did not warrant for the 7-course omakase menu. We ordered 6 dishes to share and that filled us up well. The shiso and ikura tempura was so innovative and delicious and I could not get enough of the "secret" brown sauce drizzled artfully on the plate of grilled pork. I found out from the skillful and chatty chef who helms the kitchen, he changes the items on their menu regularly as most ingredients are seasonal, so I should expect to see a whole new menu at our next visit. I was really happy to hear that since I'll be planning another visit with my friends real soon

I have been here 3 times, so I make this review based on multiple visits (not my choice to visit the 3rd time) The food here is ok - it's nothing special, but the reason I have to make the rating so poor is that this place is very expensive for what you get, $500 for 2 people with a cheap bottle of sake and we left still hungry is my biggest bugbear for this place. Will not be returning for a 4th time

Brilliant, just brilliant. Chef-owner Pepe has found the holy grail combining Spanish and Japanese gastronomy. You can see him and his team working hard right in front of you. Don't be afraid to go for the Omakase, your tastebuds will never forget it. I want to go back again soon.The restaurant is tiny so you need to book unless you want to eat at the bar

This place is overrated..food was not good..chef has no character in his cooking..rip off for the price they r charging..will never return..we ordered the best omakase too..

A nice restaurant with an interesting concept, Spanish and Japanese fusion. Go for lunch to give a try, but reserve a place for dinner if you really want to enjoy the experience.

A very interesting izakaya concept with very good food... other than sakes, they also have a great choice of wines if you prefer..
5
Great atmosphere, fantastic friendly informed serviced combined with some of the best plates I have had in Singapore. Always a favourite but getting even better with age!

Came back here for a 2nd visit recently, and again to try the sake - this time after dinner nearby. There's a good selection of sake and being served in a carafe doesn't seem to be a problem. We had 2 carafes of sake (2 different types) at a price of around $95 which, although not cheap, is fair value for Singapore. Need to come back and try the food some time
5
Just returned here about year after opening - the food still is superb taster plates grounded in European with Asian twists, and owner very present. Very friendly staff and the place humming (but not too noisy) on a Wednesday night. Less expensive, more comfortable and dishes degrees better than Atherton's Esquina
5
When we first looked at the menu we were a little bit stunned because tapas ranged from $6 - $38 so it kinda looked expensive but when the dishes started to arrive, we realized the prices were reasonable A lot of the dishes were out of the world amazing. Everyone does uni capellini - they did not stinge on the uni but more than that, there was the smoothness of the uni, the crunchiness of small prawns and the freshness from the citrus juice of lemon. For the duck gyoza , there was the normal meat but with a twist from the sun-dried tomato - again a dish with multi-dimensional flavors. Scallops and hummus - again an unusual combination. The atmosphere of the place and lively and upbeat - very nice on a working evening. Would highly recommend this place to everyone'.

The first impression was that this restaurant was cramped and the walkway were tight. However, after we were seated and the saki started flowing, the packed restaurant actually became festive. The food was no doubt good and prepared with lots of heart. Service staff were friendly which added up to the whole lively ambient. It was a very enjoyable evening. I recommend BAM

We had a company function there yesterday. 21 of us turn up and was blown away by the quality of the food at BAM. What many didn't know is that the Chef is actually 3 Star Michellin Chef. With the price that you are paying. It's absolutely value worth of money. I have been to other places where I think the Stars goes lesser to the food. It's my second time time and I decided to do a corp event obviously for a good reason. I am glad everyone enjoyed the food, ambiance and services. Many said they are gg to bring more friends and family there. Thanks BAM for a wonderful night

It is a Sake restaurant, but this was overkill. We went for the tasting menu which is served with different sake for every course. The food was ok, but nothing fantastic and each meal was served with a glass of sake which was at the size of a normal wine glass. You can argue that it is nice to get a lot of sake, but I do not think that I will drink sake for the next year after this visit. I did not drink half of what was served and was still tasting sake 2 days after. The bill was 2 times more than it was worth and I have no interest in going back

We sat at the counter and were mesmerized by the chefs, all careful, consistent and talented. The menu is smallish but very well executed.
5
This chef is talented and when we asked him about how he prepared his food, he was very open in sharing.

small restaurant with few tables
food - average
Overall: wouldnt recommend if you want to catch up with friends over here for dinner or on a date as it is very noisy, tables were very close to each other .. not worth the monies

I have been eating here while visiting Singapore for few days. It has been recommended by a friend. It was a great surprise! Cosy intimate place, amazing food, professional service and fairly priced. Portions are quite small so make sure you order enough dishes... :)
5
Tapas and sake aren't two things you really would associate together but BAM nailed it. The tapas are so delicious and fusion combination, every dish is a delight for the eyes and your mouth. Highlight was the desert...it is not a place to linger as they have two seatings in the evening or if you like to stay you need to come at the second seating at 8.30pm. Prices are also high but worth the mone
5
I love the tapas concept of this place . However If you look for something typical Spanish , I don't recommend you .If you are looking for a place to enjoy food , definitive is one of the top in Singapore .Fine dinning food at more affordable price, with a personal touch of the chef

I went to Bam when it first opened and again several months later. All the dishes (favorite were capellini & foie gras) were good, as was the sake selection. They have a good banana cake dessert. Modern & hip, minimalist theme. Bar seating good for dates
5
The dining room is intimately small and spotless. Service was brisk, un-fussed and completely professional. The food was innovative and delicious. My kid also enjoyed the foods and i definitely give a thumbs up to the chefs and wonderful staff.i love watching them cook your food just infront of your seat. SARAP

This tiny restaurant / izakaya serves Spanish tapas with a Japanese twist.We sat at the counter with a wide view over the kitchen and how the sous-chefs were preparing our food. Everything done with high level of detail.We had fresh oysters, trout tartar, capellini with sakura ebi, garlic leaves and brillat savarin to finish. The flavours were surprising and yet balanced.They have a curated choice of saké, wine and cava. The chef is from Barcelona and talks to the clients individually making the experience more personal.The portions are good to share and the prices follow the high standard.The saké is served by glass or small bottle (300 ml).The enormous glass chiller at the entrance is quite impressive.The staff is attentive and competent

BAM Tapas Sake Bar in Tras Street Singapore is one of the best restaurants I have ever eaten at. It's a Spanish restaurant that serves Sake. It doesn't compromise on the quality of it's ingredients, and it's taste combinations are amazingly good. The food is fresh and cooked in front of you, if you are sitting at the counter, and it's not a problem if you do not like chilli - the chef is very flexible. Apart from the wonderful food, the Tapas bar is medium priced, with mains coming in at below or around S$30. I had the gastronomie menu to try, and was not disappointed with any of the dishes! I've listed a few below:Japanese Squid, Celery and Celeriac, Vadouvan. Charcoal grilled Spanish Pork, 'Trinxat', Myoga. Seafood of the day, Spicy Espelette Pepper Pasta.Japanese Sole Fish, Spinach Catalan style, Sambal. Burrata, Pasta 'a la plancha', Black Truffle. Charcoal grilled Quail, Eggplant and Roasted Garlic. Wagyu Beef Onglet, Onion, Red Wine sauce.If you want to eat well, and are in Singapore try BAM

Affordable set lunch menu and super good quality service! Its worth every penny, the cold capellini pasta with sakura ebi and uni was SO good! Definitely coming back for more. :)

The food was so good, and we loved all the dishes we ordered. And 1 plus point of the Bam was that service charge was excluded in the total bill, so you only tip if you like the service. Definately back for more.

I had dinner with a friend at BAM! yesterday evening. I was blown away. It is about a whole atmosphere, with fantastic sake and.... excellent food. Be sited at the bar ! You will enjoy Chef Pepe and Chef Selim preparing their dishes while helping you discover unique tastes and top ingredients. Very friendly and professional service, nice setting, perfect environment for a memorable moment. Will come back

This was my second visit to BAM and it was superb!Since a while my husband and I planned to go back, so last night we finally made it…Having a good memory from our first visit, we arrived with even higher expectations which have been exceeded by far!We love the vibe of the place with its rustic design, the metal placemats on the counter, beautiful glass ware and cutlery. I personally love to sit on high chairs, watching the chefs working in an open kitchen.The staff is very professional and attentive. Orders are taken fast and always on time.Everything goes so smooth and you feel like you want more and more food and drinks.The idea of having the choice between wine or Sake to go with your tapas is just amazing!Usually Im not a fan of fusion restaurants at all, but BAM puts it very well together. The blend of japanese cuisine with spanish cooking methods and products is very nicely done.We had the following tapas: Jamon with tomato bread, foie gras terrine, prawns with avocado puree, cold capellini with sea urchin, japanese sting ray, wagyu beef onglet and Mont d'or cheese to finish our meal!And Im telling you - I wanted MORE!! Not because I was still hungry, but because its sooo good and you don't want to stop trying the tapas.All in all, from beginning till the end, service & food - all amazing!A must try place in Singapore!!!Unfortunately we are moving out of Singapore, so probably we can only go back to BAM while visiting… :-(Keep it up guys!Thank you chef Pepe and team :-

Came here for some sake after lunch at a nearby restaurant in June 2014. I recall being impressed by the design and the choices of alcohol available. Being lunchtime we of course had to be responsible and limit ourselves to a small sake bottle but I do hope to come back for another visit in the near future, hopefully to also try the food
5
My boyfriend and I stumbled across Bam by pure chance last Friday evening, we no idea what to expect we but were blown away. Great service and fabulous food!! We were having a bit of a celebration so treated ourselves to the chefs surprise menu with sake pairing. Every dish was beautifully put together and tasted equally as delicious. I would highly recommend giving the place a try but worth booking at the weekend, we were lucky to get a seat
5
It was a really late dinner for my boyfriend and I, so we tried our luck at Bam! as I had always wanted to try it, as he sang praises about it since the last time he was there. They were extremely accommodating despite it was almost 10pm. The food, from the start till the end, was a burst of flavours in our mouths with a lot of different textures in each dish! The freshness and quality of the ingredients used were just astonishing. Chef Pepe's friendliness humble personality took me by a sweep. Definitely a place to go if you would like to have great Spanish Tapas. Not extremely cheap, but definitely worth the price
5
It's my 2nd time in Bam, and I was very happy to be back,I have Met the chef a few times, so i asked him to do what he want for us, and the result was stunning,great use of ingredients, amazing combination of flavours, texture...We had about 7 to 8 different dishes and all of them were impressive.i will be back for sure
5
We had the Omakase set and it just send us back to Spain!!! The Gambas prawn freshness is still in my mouth (& so I hope)! The octopuses are done to perfection!Abalone mushroom soup is heavenly, caviar scallop pasta you won't wana miss, & so many more dishes that just brings back the good memories of all the real good food in Spain. Totally worth it

Visited with a friend and tried a range of tapas and the sake. Sake and wine by the glass very limited choices and poor quality. The gyoza were good but everything was poor to average and at premium prices. Bill came without asking as a second seating was due. Won't be going back
