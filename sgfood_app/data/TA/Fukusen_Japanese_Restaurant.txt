Such a hiden gem inside of a boutique hotel. Me and wife dine for lunch this day. We had the Sashimi Set and also the soft shell crab sushi. The time waiting for the dishes to arrive took a good 10 minutes. Presentation was well. The staffs at the restaurant are so friendly and they are eye for attention to the patrons even though the light setting was quite dim. Food was tasty enough to decide to return in future. Love them!

We recently move our office near this restaurant and decided to try it for dinner. It was a very pleasant discovery. Great food, excellent service and reasonable prices. The scallops are delicious and so the sashimi and all the food we tried. Sake is reasonably priced too.We will go back for more

Went there with my hubby on a friday night as we were intending to have some sashimi and this restaurant happens to be on the entertainer app.Made a reservations with CHOPE and was there at 6pm. We were the 2nd diner to arrive and was pretty amazed with the size of the restaurant vs the no of service staffs (cozy place with closed to 4 servers, pretty great ratio).We were immediately seated by a sweet lady who explained to us that there is a happy hour deal for beers etc and we quickly explained that we will be using the entartainer to redeem a bottle of sake. She went on recommend what are the available sakes which i thought was a good pro-activeness.We decided to have a slow dinner since we are so early, taking one dish at a time. We started with the chef's recommendation of Hotate capaccio with truffle oil n spinach sauce which was so delicious! I tot that all truffle infused food wld lack creativity but the spinach sauce worked really well with the oil n the scallops. Our 2nd dish was the ordinary salmon belly, which to our surprise has a really nice bite to it and tasted really really fresh (Im not a fan of salmon sashimi) but kinda liked this so much we ordered another serving. Hubby ordered a mekajiki which I didnt touched cos dont like the colour of the fish...He said it was also very fresh.We moved on to the cooked dishes or Tori karaage which is almost a staple of most japanese joint but most times, falls flat in terms of flavour cos the oiliness wld have overwhelmed the chicken pieces but not his joint! The chicken actally tasted like chicken n the skin was crispy n not oily. The grilled Saba was ordinary and the cold somen with roasted sesame and lemon zest was a refreshing end to a really good meal.To top it off, the owner came to thank us for offering our table for 4 pax to a group of diners who came by after we have finished our meal. He gave us ice cream which we were very thankful of but he came back with a plate of grilled puffer fish to further show his appreciationw which we politely turned down as we didnt think it was really necessary since we already finished our meal n its a Friday night, we can move to a smaller table to enjoy our last cup of sake!!We will def be back because of the 3 reasons:1) super fresh sashimi2) great attentive service3) extremely customer oriented owner!!!Well done! Looking forward to coming to your establishment again!!!

I came here for the first time last week for lunch with a friend and opted for one of the bento boxes. All quite tasty and reasonably priced (at about $24 for mine). Service was a bit random with my meal arriving about 15 mins before my friend's, but apart from that all was ok. Worth considering for another visit

I went to Fukusen with a friend a few days ago. We were kindly greeted and offered to choose our table. As the first impression is the most important, I can say that I felt warmly welcome upon my arrival.In this place they provide lateral service, the owner of the restaurant as well as the chef or the barista can be taking your order. We didn't know what meal to choose and the recommendation we got were honnest and personnallzed. When I asked for the wifi, Liow Wei Kim typed the code and after a while (when we had stopped using our phones) came back and offered us to charge them as he had noticed that our battery is low. That's how to impress the guest!The food is excellent. We chose 2 platter of sushis and a rice meal with minced tuna. -- LIttle letdown : the portion could be slighty bigger.++ DBS account holder get 15% off on the total bill. When we left the restaurant Liow Wei Kim passed us his business card and also denied the tip we offered explaining that this service is part of his restaurant. We really felt been taken care of and will definitely come again. Thank you to the staff for their care and for being attentive to our needs

found the restaurant by chance walking by and went following WE. what fist attracted us is that the menu is somehow more diverse than the usual Japanese restaurant I have been to. they have a particular liking to foie gras. so do i.ordered foie gras and mushroom for curiosity. felt a tiny regret that this is not a foie gras dish in the sense that it is bits of foie gras that get overcooked, but it give the buttered mushroom a very interesting tone. was not disappointed.the sashimi were just outstanding (particular notice to tuna, salmon, swordfish).tuna and avocado roll was also a melting pleasure.associated to the happy hour one beer for two till 8pm, which lasted for the whole dinner, we had a very satisfying evening.ambiance is cozy. dark wooden tone, not noisy although the restaurant was full. good attentive service
