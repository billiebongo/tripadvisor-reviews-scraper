Food was good and the price was acceptable. The variety of menu is really awesome that we ordered 5 mains and 1 side for 4 adults. The truffle fries was superb however the portion is a little small for the price we pay.
3
Boring, ok, not too bad, not too good food. Service is just ok. It's fine overall. Not comfortable, not cozy, just meh.
2
Wasn’t a pleasant experience at all. The staff wasn’t helpful nor friendly. We asked a question to clarify if our order was right and was replied to in a condescending tone. Rude. Will not visit again.
4
Food is okay but can be inconsistent at times. Service is strange and we were all wondering what to think
5
Our order was taken the moment we were ready, with hardly any lag time. Food came quite fast and was good.
4
Their mushroom pasta with truffle is DELICIOUS! The prices are slightly on the expensive side for cafes. Could do with a bit more garnishing to enhance the overall presentation.
4
Nice CBD cafe that's away from the main raffles place crowd. Good soups and bread, a little pricey though
4
We ended up eating breakfast here every morning during our stay in Singapore. The breakfast set is nice also everything from the list was nice. Especially I recommend the juice made from green apples!Service was nice too, we were 8 persons all together so it's understandable that things don't happen in seconds.I recommend this place to everyone in the hoods
4
I came to know of this restaurant after being interested in the exhibition Fasciation: A Ruthless Fetish that they currently had there... My boyfriend and I decided to have a meal there and he ordered Eggs Benedict while I had Carbonara. It was delicious though I believe through nobody's fault, I came across something unwanted in the Carbonara. However, the server was polite and offered to replace the dish as well drinks on the house.
3
Their truffle fries is very nice, it has the smell and taste of truffle oil drizzle onto it. Taste good even when it turns cold.. Tried the eggs royale but it does not match my expectation as I had better ones. For those who like to try special drinks should try their orange berry.
5
We had to make a last-minute reservation for a 16 pax dinner. We were able to do so on Chope and Aaron and team were excellent hosts for our evening. Prices are reasonable too. Great value and an awesome spot by the CBD!
5
Had breakfast with some friends and my baby in tow. The food was very nice, a bit pricey, but overall no complaints and the service was spot on. I would certainly go back. They accommodated our party of 4 plus stroller.
4
i went there alone for the brunch.
but i suggest don't choose almond milk with latte..
for me .. i feel the taste a little weird...
3
Not exactly a supermarket but a decent place for lunch or quick meal in the central business district with no service charge. Give their refreshing juices a try.
4
loved their pasta and mushroom soup. their chicken in wine sauce failed to meet the mark thou. truffles fries came with real truffles but portion was too big. good if they can have a half size
5
Food was pleasant, service is good. Definitely recommended to head there. Always loved the truffle kelp fries there.
3
Food is not too bad but is rather on a pricey side. Serving was small as well. The brioche needs a little bit of improvement to taste more like a brioche than just a normal white bread.
5
All dishes ordered were delicious. Truffle fries was filled with truffle taste...not just truffle oil fragrance. The mushroom truffle pasta was refreshing with the addition of corn. Was a nice quiet place in the evening for girls gathering!
3
The ambiance and food is average, nothing I cannot get in any other restaurant. The service was below par, though. The feeling the whole group got from the server was like he was not happy to be there or he's not happy we're there for him to serve. Either way, it was very uncomfortable and awkward.
4
SPRMRKT is a cosy cafe that is tucked away in between the quiet rows of shophouses along the fringe of CBD, making it a nice change from the busy cafe brunch scene in town that usually leaves me exasperated just from trying to get a server's attention. My order of salmon and spinach omelette was well presented, and there was a morsel of smoked salmon in every mouthful that I had. The side of curly fries was just what I needed for a rainy Sunday; comforting fast food! My mocha was delightfully well executed, not a hint of acidity nor overly roasted beans was detected. It was a pleasant meal to start the end of my weekend.FYI, the menu is different from the one that is uploaded online
5
Great food, I had eggs benedikt on spinach and porotbello 'shrums... omg! Relaxed and friendly stuff. I also liked they serve cold cucumber water the moment you sit...
3
Food is okay. Service was good by the staff. Always had the same thing. Overpriced though. It's more expensive than others
5
as usual, favourite hideout (: self service is gone, they now take orders and serve you directly. Great place (:
4
The one and only service crew available could be more attentive instead of using his phone, and outgoing as he speaks. The beef was good tho!
4
Attention from staff was good and food varieties and taste were average.
I would recommend the Truffle Fries though.
Good atmosphere kind of cafe to chill out on weekends.
4
Sprmrkt served great Truffle Fries! My Friends and I enjoyed the meal. Service was not too bad, could be improved
5
Group of 5 Aussies looking for an Aussie Brekky, we found it. Loved the service, food and ambience. Real coffee and value for money. Hard to find in Singapore.
3
Sprmrkt is both a casual restaurant and a shop that sells produce and novelty items. Their servings are huge and can be shared between two people. The beef lasagna and pork ribs taste just fine. Not spectacular but not bad either. Their menu is different between lunch and dinner and I find the dinner selection to be slightly on the pricey side
4
Ambience and decoration within the restaurant. Restaurant was quite easily accessible from Tanjong Pagar MRT. Ordered the Royale Breakfast and my girls ordered the pancake all day breakfast. Both breakfast was served shortly and the food was fresh and delicious. Definitely worth visiting but recommended to place reservation prior to patronizing to avoid disappointment in not getting seats
4
Ordered a salad and a truffle fries, friend had the egg florentine - all very good. There was a good selection for meat/greens/dressing for the salad, and drinks were wholesome and clean too :) Just hard to remember the restaurant's name as it's a play with the word "Supermarket"? :)
3
Food (fish & chips, steak, catch of the day-salmon..) was below/near average; truffle fries was good. Waited an hour for steak to be served :( Ambience and service were relatively good.
5
Staff was friendly and food was great! Nice comfortable environment to catch up with friends and chill.
3
Sprmrkt is a nice place for brunch, however, food quality & quantity could have some improvements. However, service was quite good.
2
It was my second visit but the food quality was so much lower than my first experience! I had the carbonara, which tasted really bland. Completely opposite from my first experience. I would probably not visit the second time.
3
Just average ever since it has changed. A pity that only the brunch menu is available now. Skip this one and visit the other branch.
5
SPRMRKT serves really good brunch food. Ordered their weekend roast and it was really good - best pork chop and ribeye combination. Would be great if there were more sides to accompany
4
I enjoyed the eggs ben but the coffee was a little weak. Would be good if it could be stronger. Nonetheless, nice cafe.
3
Selection is quite limited. My friend and I had salmon sandwiches and the soup of the day. The bread were slightly hard and not warm. Soup was not hot. Our overall rating for the food was average.
5
From the moment we entered the cafe, we were greeted with excellent client service. From helping us to change our seats to food recommendation and explaining in detail the different fruits and herbs which they are also selling in the cafe, we were very pleased with the service. As we have 2 separate Chope vouchers which were supposed to be used on 2 different receipts, the staff was kind to help arrange such that we could use both in a single receipt.Personally, I enjoyed the smoked duck quiche with the staff strongly recommended. The overall service was great but the food portion could be improved for the price that is being charged
1
Overall experience is awful. I booked the place beforehand and put a special requirement that a window table is preferred. But finally I got a corner table, though there were a plenty of window tables available. I ordered the Royale eggs Benedict-the source is so thing and tasteless and egges were two raw. The yolk was running on my plate, which literally made a mess. The toast was good but was soaked in those fluidly hotch potch for so long. The whole dish was a disaster I have to say.And they put on the music too loud and my friend and I basically couldn't talk to each other:(I will not go to there again.
4
A great place to catching up with friends - waiters were friendly and helpful with menus and our orders. Recommended for good food with a decent price in CBD area :)
5
The food is so tasty and well cooked, can tell that chef has placed in much effort in planning and executing the meals. One of the best carbonara I have tasted. Even their salad is awesome. Well done!!!
5
This is my fourth time meeting my clients up here in SPRMRKT for a quick meeting. We usually get ourselves boost wine and fries.
2
The standard of the food at this outlet is way far below what the branch serves. Was told that we need to wait 15-20mins for meat dish. End up the fries was served even later then the meat. Took about 30mins for the fries.
4
The food was generally good, especially the truffle fries! The service was great too, and even though we stayed till the closing hour, the staff were still very helpful in ensuring that we were having a good time! Definitely going back again :)
5
If only there were wallplugs. I think people will never leave this place. Definitely be coming back again.
4
Food was good! Sadly their tofu tempe salad was sold out at lunch time though. Tried their rice bowl and pancake in the end. Both were good! And portions were substantial for the price. The aircon was not working though, which made the place very stuffy. Staff was not attentive enough to ask us to shift to another table even though there was no crowds.
2
Ordered the salad - with a price tag of $16 i could have got better food elsewhere of same value like Shinkansen @ OFC. Sauteed beef was hard and dry. Variety wasnt fantastic. Server gave us the wrong order and insisted it was ours until we told her repeatedly it wasnt ours. Overall it was a letdown and will not return
4
Went to SPRMKT with a group of friends for dinner. Like how it wasn't too crowded on a weekday evening. Had their grain bowl and apart from a slightly small portion, quality of the food was there. Their cakes were great too but we felt overpriced ($9 for a small slice!
4
I went there for lunch with my friend and we were surprised by the quality of food. There are so many places now in the CBD and the quality is not always good.We tried the vegetarian lasagna and “design-your-own-salad” plate with wild rice, egg and a mix of cooked veggies and green leaves.Portions were big and ingredients fresh and tasty.The place is quiet (or maybe because we went there around 1.30pm). All in all we really enjoyed our lunch break.Daily menu options or regular menu (including all-day breakfast) so you will always find something you like
4
quality food at a fraction of the price. always my favourite all day breakfast resto.. however the chicken sandwich was a disappointment. slightly cramp and noisy.
3
Google Map led me to a blocked road and in the end turned a big round to reach there late. The staff thought that I cancelled my reservation. Rosti was only in half piece, might not be enough for a guy. Taste ok.
4
Not as much variety as some other places but the food is great. Slightly expensive but very satisfying.
4
Great little place in a vibrant neighborhood! Yummy truffle fries and creamy pasta. Busy weekday lunch, but still felt comfortable to enjoy amid the hustle and bustle
3
Overall taste of food is ok. The place needs to improve on ventilation, rather hot when I am expecting an air-conditioned space.
3
Reasonable pricing for a big group dining. Good for all who like to have breakfast all day. But the place can be a little hot.
5
Usually not a fan of fries but the truffle fries here had us finishing the lot in no time and have been back there several times. Pasta and brunch dishes were excellent. The usual cafe fare but overall great food quality, service and ambience.
5
Both my clients are fan of SPRMRKT and we've been meeting up here over drinks/dinner for the 4th time already.
4
Tried the Diners' Choice tasting menu and it was really good value! However, the cafe was a little hot.
4
The cafe was located within walking distance from the MRT station. Till the end of this month, it is having Chope Diners' Choice Tasting Menu at $25, consists of Truffle Fries with Parmesan & Kelp, Eggs Benedict/Eggs Florentine (V)/Eggs Royale/Pasta of the Day, Bread & Butter Pudding with Housemade Vanilla Sauce, and Coffee or Tea.Truffle Fries with Parmesan & Kelp ($13)For a half serving, the amount was quite a lot which I could not finish it.I selected the Pasta of the Day which was Seafood Laksa Pasta ($23)prawn, squid, crispy fried tofu & poached egg in rich laksa sauceFor a cold and wet night, it was the right thing to warm me up. The laksa sauce was rich and creamy, without being too spicy. The poached egg made the sauce even more richer.The cafe ran out of Bread & Butter Pudding with Housemade Vanilla Sauce, and it was replaced with a slice of pound cake. The cake was buttery and lemony.I had the meal with English Breakfast Tea which was served in a French Press. The tea was hot and flavourful.Overall the food was great and very filling. The place was packed. Best make a reservation before coming down
2
food is just so so. we ordered English breakfast tea. apparently it was served with Earl Grey.... need to wait long for milk to be served.
5
Good variety of food. The truffle fries is definitely worth a try. Need to do reservation during lunch hour as its a busy restaurant with limited seatings.
5
Good selection of food - your traditional breakfast foods, but also interesting options for the more curious tastebuds.
A little on the steep side though!
Eggs florentine + half an avocado ($14+3)
4
Slightly pricy, but very good soup and quality salad, especially the generous helping of salmon and mushrooms! Love their crab soup of the day
4
Right smack in business district, this cafe has a nice quiet, yet classy atmosphere for business discussions.
5
there's 2 sprmrkt both are good! service excellent and ambiance cosy! weekends we go to the one in MCcallum st for easy parking n much quieter than weekdays! the newer branch by the river has great pasta and gd coffee plus good view, when the weather is cooler you can sit outside too. yum is great to talk too and recommends good food! enjoy ! has been our fave cafes to chill out for quite awhile now
3
Heard about the place from a friend of mine and decided to make a visit down. We had Chicken on toast with caramelised onions, braised beef cheek and truffle mash and truffles fries with kelp and parmesan. The chicken was disappointing with the meat on the dry side. The beef cheek and truffle mash was pretty good but would have expected a better quality given the price. Have heard a lot about their truffle fries and while it was pretty good, did not feel that they were to be that raved about
4
Felt like brunch for dinner and landed in SPRMRKT. It's a cozy and quaint cafe with a very homely ambiance - be sure to check out the various bottled goods they sell, there's an interesting variety of jams, sauces, and dressings.For two of us, we had an Eggs Florentine each, Sweet Potato Fries, a slice of Coconut Rum Tres Leches cake, and a bottle each of beer and cider. The Fries with the Curry Mayo was delicious! The eggs were light and fluffy and the Hollandaise sauce, just perfect. The cake could've been a little more moist, but still hit the right notes. I'll definitely go back to try some of their mains
4
Menu uploaded on Chope was not updated, so was quite disappointed when the food we wanted to try for that day was not available. That being said, the Pulled Pork Burger with Paprika Fries was delicious. Pulled pork was not dry and the fries were to die for. The lemon and tumeric duck breast on the other hand was very dry and lacked oomph. Will not recommend this dish to others. Dining experience was good, staff were attentive and friendly
4
Went over at a chope promotion. Had the buffalo wings, salad, chocolate beernut shake and chiffon cake. They serve true buffalo wings, not the fake ones that use bbq sauce. I loved the cake, will certainly go back for more.Sat in a cosy corner, perfect for catching up on news or emails
5
Pricy for a cafe but it's nice and hip. Also air condition slightly defective so it's a bit hot. But they sell a lot of other cool stuff that can be bought, so it's quite cool
5
Nice cosy location. Friendly staff and great food. One of the best truffle fries in town. Freshly baked cakes.
4
A little pricy like everything in Singapore but very good, I took the wage burger and my husband the fish and chip quite surprising as tainted with black ink! Tasteful!
4
Loved the food and coffee was amazing! Bonus that they're open on weekends and the counter is hidden at the back :)
4
Back here for the nice shop decor and ambience. I had their truffle fries a year ago, and it was much better then. Couldn't taste the truffle oil :( nevertheless, I'm sure their mains are as good as before!
5
Love the cosiness of the restaurant. Staff were pleasant and very friendly. The food was delish and worth every penny.
3
I went to Sprmrkt with friends for a quick lunch. Mixed reviews. It really depends on what you order. I tried the avocado toast. It was quite bland. The pickled onions were tasty but more was needed. Generous serving of avocado though. Bread was hard. My friend shared her sausage and it was delicious!!! I tried the coconut rum tres leches cake. It was not what I expected of Tres Leches cake. Only the rum taste was discernible. The sweet potato fries with curry dip was also so-so. They were nothing special
1
The only place where we went and had to actually leave without eating! We chanced upon this place last night and asked them specifically if they make omelettes without ham and flat, well done, etc.- and both the men said 'of course - we can do anything for you', we are very flexible. We asked if they are open on saturday morning (today) and they said 7 am - and again assured us they can do things for us. we felt good and specially decided to come today.Today we reached at 10 am after exercising- hungry and tired. And we received bad service. The waitress was not fully listening to us and totally inflexible. Right out she said there is nothing vegetarian till after 11 am, even though we were to ask for omelette without ham. She then said she can get the omelette without ham, but anything else is 'special orders' and they don't do special orders on weekends! The 'anything else' being - adding onions instead of ham and making a flat omelette instead of folded -is that a special order?! We specifically told her that we asked about this yesterday and especially came for this reason here today- she stuck to her position and said sorry, our policy on weekends is clear- no special orders, she cannot help. We actually got up and walked out! She was least concerned. You lost a potential regular customer- we stay close by - we are never going there to try anything
4
Went here with my friends for breakfast, it's a nice little restaurant with a little shop in it. I had yoghurt berries which was really heavy though it doesn't seem as a lot, but tasted great! My friend had the English breakfast and a smoothie, also very tasty. The smoothie was very big! Friendly staff and good pricing. I spent about less than $20 on coffee and yoghurt. Will visit again
4
Family brunch with my 2 kids. Cafe has 2 baby seats. So please take note. Service was quite good as well. Ordered Pulled Pork Burger and the taste was fantabulous. Generous serving of fries to come with the burger as well. Just note that the cafe us smallish and a little squeezy. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our simple brunch there.
3
disappointed with the egg benedict as the eggs are like yakun's half boiled eggs. Truffles fies are good thou.
4
Staff was super pleasant. Prompt in delivering ordered food. Food was interesting and good. Overall great dining experience.
4
The staff were friendly and eager to make recommendations. I had their carbonara and am surprised to find that it came with a poached egg! It's an unexpected find and I would say it's worth a try.
2
Really like the concept but waiting for 30 minutes plus for an omelette is just not up to scratch
Feels like chaos in even ordering a coffee but in fairness food is very good quality
2
Good healthy food but the worst customer service in Singapore. I have yet to come here where my order is not confused or mixed up or I have to repeat myself five times at the till. Is it really that hard to train staff?!
5
Love the eggs benedict and truffle fries with kelp here. The pulled pork burger with beetroot is good too. The cafe is dotted with art pieces on its walls, and retails cool stuff you may love having in your kitchen. I love coming here, but it can be a problem getting a table during weekday lunchtime as it is near many office buildings
4
This place seems to have developed a healthy customer base over the short period that it's been open, it's always encouraging to overhear customers being asked if they would like their "usual". It has a comfortable, informal feel about it, an air of a family run place, but not in a bad way.A modest menu, serviceable western coffee, booze if you need it, healthy wifi, seating inside and covered seating outside if the weather is being a bit Singaporean, and competent and polite staff. Not personally a fan of brioche, they're happy enough to substitute multi-grain with my smoked salmon and eggs, and delivered within 10 mins, despite being fairly busy
4
It was a late Sat noon and eateries around Telok Ayer and Tg Pagar are mostly closed for the day. Imagine my surprise when we chanced upon Sprmrkt and they were taking in the last orders for the day! Decided to go for their cold soba noodle salad and it had to be the most appetizing soba salad I had! We didn't stay too long in the restaurant but would definitely be back again as there are so many items I would like to try! Oh, I ordered a pandan and honey drink and it was just perfect for the hot sweltering weather
5
Sprmkt is a hidden gem, which in my opinion, serves the best truffle fries in Singapore. Try it once and you're sold. They have the perfect combination of parmesan, fries and kelp. The kelp is the extra something that makes it different from elsewhere. I'm not sure about you, but I have tried truffle fries elsewhere that either have too little truffle oil it tastes like ordinary fries or too much that it taste like gasoline. This one is just right. The fries are crispy golden brown and not oily, garnished with generous amounts of parmesan and kelp. It costs $12 a basket and best to be savored with friends
4
We came here today for a coffee after lunch, a cappuccino and a long black. Perhaps not quite as hot as I would like, the cappuccino was nevertheless quite good with a pretty little design in the froth. Easy to get a seat and to be served at about 1.30pm
4
A hidden gem that should deserve more attention.
Chef is there to chat with you after your lunch, and he is cute! Cosy place, good coffee, good menu, excellent food, just a little lack of humph
4
One of the best cafes which I have visited so far. Located in CBD area. The eggs bene was good! The prices were reasonable. I have been there twice, probably more in future. Definitely worth checking out!
3
Good taste, newly renovated I think, this cafe has got great food. The retail side of the cafe is a bit cheesy, with plastic fruits and veggies, a bit strange as it doesn't give you the feel of authenticity. But the ingredients were excellent, just that the place is not somewhere I would go back often
4
Had originally intended to go to the Danish bakery around the corner, but was closed due to 'power surges'.Sprmrkt had good atmosphere, quite busy, nice eggs (a bit undercooked, but I like them like that). My friend's vegetarian Potato stack was much smaller than it could have been. Coffee was nic
4
We visited the Sprmrkt today for lunch. Its a great little venue, and its like being in London or at a Farmer's Market as all the produce is piled up around the restaurant. Its very clean and the menu was interesting. I ate Eggs Benedict as there wasn't much choice on the salads. However, the food was good quality. However, the service was so slow. It was over 30 minutes from ordering til our food arrived at the table and this is quite stressful during the weekday lunchtime. The restaurant was busy and the atmosphere was good. I would suggest if they speed up the service this would be even better.Worth going back and trying again though
5
Over here, you've got to pour your own water, which is located at one corner where there are glasses stacked nicely. This is definitely much better than having to call for someone just to fill up your water. Service staff's friendly, kind and definitely exceeds expectations.Order the truffle fries, and if you see there is a salmon in puff pastry on the menu, order it
5
I'm always looking for simple, easy going and pure food concepts. This place is one I definitely add to my list excellent examples!When I'm dreaming of my own shop in which I would like to combine good food, a nice interior and nice, funky, artistic stuff to sell, it should look and feel like this place.We enjoyed our food (Tuesday's special grilled chicken ceasar salad, the omelette and bread pudding as dessert) and the ambiance. We regretted that we didn't order the truffle fries as a side dish. It seems to be a house specialty and it smelled and looked delicious.We liked the staff for their service and attention. Even the chef/owner came by to ask if we enjoyed the food. Sure we did!Worth to go here if you're visiting Singapore
4
This little cafe has a few items that rotate through the menu, so it's different every day, while also having their breakfast items available all day. Have been there about a dozen times over the course of six months or so. Staff is friendly, prices are reasonable, food is consistently very good.
5
I can't sing the praises of this place enough.- great coffee - check- fantastic cakes - check. The cheesecake on a Tuesday is to die for. The bread and butter pudding heavenly. The brownie is yummy. The list goes on and on. You have to come regularly to try them all. - the white chocolate and raspberry breakfast ... OMG!- the menu changes daily but the food always great. Their cured beef sandwich and lasagne two of my favorites.- and they serve alcohol so a cheeky cider or wine!You need to add this to you places to 'must go' list
4
I have to admit: I am a regular. When in Singapore I live across the street and en up having breakfast, lunch or dinner here perhaps to often. The food is very good. Different menu every day (with some fixed items) and the chef takes great pride in his work. He, more often than not, comes out to ask how the food was, if the portion was right or if there was something in particulate I/we liked/disliked about the dish. The service of the staff is excellent. On our second visit they asked my name and since then they address me by name when I come in - even if I have been away for a couple of months. Interior is trendy but pleasant and they often feature photo exhibitions local artist. Great place for a quick tasty meal
