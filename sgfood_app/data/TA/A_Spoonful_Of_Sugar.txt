What a lovely place. Small, but with the most amazing waffles. We had the waffle with coconut ice cream. Delicious.

One of our favourite cafes in Changi Village. Located just along the main road behind the bus stop. Love their thick and fluffy waffle with icecream as its delicious and reasonably priced. Another attraction is their pretty wall and ceiling deco.

I love the cosyness of the space and the menu provided comes with quite interesting flavours for selection. Such as earl grey, thai tea etc

Just what you need in the sultry heat of Changi! Raspberry sorbet so refreshing. Although we didn't want anything else, the neighbouring table were eating waffles! So we are going back tomorrow!

I always enjoy coming here with friends to try their waffles and ice cream. While their ice cream flavours may not be as fancy as the gelaterias in town or abroad, they serve excellent waffles and the ice cream flavours go well with the waffles. The thin and crispy waffle is round in shape and very thin (about 1.5cm Max). This will stay crunchy for longer but the subtle flavour of the waffle will be masked entirely by the ice cream. On the other hand, the thick and fluffy waffle is rectangular in shape and almost like thick toast, and it has a pleasant pancake taste that complements the ice cream. I like their honey Matcha ice cream as it resembles Jasmine green tea and not as strong as traditional Matcha green tea in hokkaido milk ice cream. The salty caramel is full of chunky roasted almonds which I love. In terms of flavour combinations (for an ice cream waffle with 2 scoops or more) I would recommend taking the milk-based ice cream flavours separately from the fruity sorbet flavours. Gula Melaka (palm sugar) flavour goes well with Salty Caramel and Vanilla. Chocolate and mint goes well with cookie and cream or sea salt malt. Raspberry, tropical and honey Matcha would make a good combination as well. The oreo cheesecake and Earl Grey cake that I tried are acceptable but not great (I think they are not made in the shop).

Always walked past this cafe without going in but because of Pokemon Go, I have been to this cafe thrice in one week. Tried quite a few items on their menus and went away impressed with their Earl Grey Ice Cream and Smore waffle. Haha my son was so satisfied with the Smore waffle that we tried to recreate it at home the next day. Their earl grey ice cream was good too! Taste of earl grey was prominent and ice cream was rich and creamy. Perfect end to one long day!

The ice cream creation tasted good, but it took a loooonnnngggg time and 2 reminders for the 5 of us to get our ice cream. 3 staff members; not too busy, and staff even had time to clean up the empty tables; but we had to flag down the staff to get our food 20 minutes later

Our 1st visit with the children. Right after our dinner a Jacob's. The decor was nice which I tink children love the place. Not much of the ice cream variety. We ordered 3 scoops: Nutella (taste like hazelnut), Coconut & Salty Caramel (recommended for sweet tooth lover).The hub ordered apple pie fry signature (Can't rem the name).Overall verdict: Average

Seating is limited with in doors and outdoor tables.Had the thin waffles. Chocolate and lavender. Lavender was unique and interesting. Waffles was crispy and good. Service not very fast. Be prepared to wait for the freshly prepared waffles. Easy to park with the mechanical car lift. No parking problems in that area.

Decided to walk around to source for alternative dessert locations after dinner at Chockful. My partner and I were waiting for another cafe to be ready but we figured that it was talking too long and we ate at a spoonful of sugar instead. We had a double scoop of ice cream and it was really average. May drop by to try the waffles next time
