Obviously not a breakfast place, since most of the stall are only getting ready to open, mostly for the office lunch crowd. The coffee was weak and egg over cooked.

Thanks to all the staff :)

Super long queues, $4 to $5 bowls of noodles, crowded tables, but rather yummy and affordable. would come back again if I have time to queue.

What a wonderful, location, and ambience, and array of foods, and service. So Singapore. Great 10 star's ****************

This is the best place for after-party supper, especially if you're in the area around clarke quay or boat quay! Prata is an option but the Bah Chor Mee is a must-try! :D

Cheap and local, it's not fancy but it's perfect!
$2.5 for a set breakfast of toast, coffee and 2 boiled eggs!
I went here each morning, the coffee isn't amazing but you get what you pay for and i loved it!

Just passed this place while near Clark Quay. Very busy during lunch hour but not without a reason. Food is cheap but good.

One of the not many places with authentic Singaporean food. Very cheap but still extremely delicious.

Came here for lunch this week with a friend, and specifically to try the specialty dry mee sua. This required a certain level of patience as it took nearly 30 mins to arrive. But it was quite helpful to be able to order and pay, take a seat and have a drink whilst waiting for the noodles to be sent to our table. And it was really quite tasty. I probably should have paid extra for a bigger serve though as the base $4 serving was too small for me

BK is a stall of about 10 vendors so you have a selection of noodles/soup to Indian to BBQ, etc. I opted for chicken/noodles/soup for 4.20 SG$, grabbed a Heineken and enjoyed a solo dinner looking out over South Bridge Road. They were cranking mostly American rock/eclectic at the time I visited. Check out the pic of dinner..

The noodles we ordered were very good. It was fast, cheap and good - what more do you need! Perfect place for a quick dinner after a long day of sightseeing.

Tried the speciality mee sua and the mushroom and minced meat dry noodles. Super tasty! We also had the fish balls in soup - great bounce. Can't wait to be back.
5
Very cheap, many different offerings, also good for just only breakfast or coffee, or a cold drink, not crowded daytime, busy in the evening.

This place offers the true combination of good meal for a very reasonable price. At least for Singapur. Great local feeling with the white collar crowd during lunch time on a week day.

A fun spot to visit. Staff very friendly and helpful. Great cold beer at an excellent price.
Good spot to watch and observe locals and travellers.

BCM typically is served with yellow noodles - flat or skinny. I love my noodles without colouring, specifically white and only a few joints in Singapore do Mee Sua "dry" well. This is one of them. Order up a classic bowl of ba Chor Mee Sua, fishball only, with an added topping of ikan bilis. Best combat to any drunken state you're in. Also a good bet if you're not drunk, just hungry.

Cheapest, tastiest food in what is globally a very expensive sector of Singapore. As a family of 3, we ended up with 2 dry mee sua and one nasi goreng for under $15 and I hear they have great deals on beer too!The nasi goreng was simple and efficient but the star of the food court is Yan Kee's dry mee sua (spicy version). The delicious noodles were starchy without being gluey and had a tasty vinegar/chili sauce that brings the dish to the next level.The food was ready in just a few minutes, great if you're in a hurry.Highly recommended

Support local street stores! It's a 4/5 for me just for how cheap it is!!This place very close to Boat Quay and a short walk from Clarke Quay but you're not paying the inflated prices!! 3 X large bottles of Tiger for $13!!!The food is very cheap (hit & miss) but worth a try as dishes are between $3-$6.00! It's mental how cheap it is!! I hope it's still there when I return! Went there for the cheap beer, sitting with locals & playing some cards!When you get your 3 beers, they leave in the table and open one at a time but will exchange for a colder one (if not opened) incase they sit on table too long & get warm :-
