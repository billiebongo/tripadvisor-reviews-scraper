Great range of classic French dishes as well as some more modern blends. Very attentive staff and lovely ambience. They also have a great 3 course lunch menu on offer. The snails are a must try as they were cooked perfectly.

Had a nice time in this restaurant. We’ve been there for diner and we were pretty surprised to see that the menu is mandatory - option à la carte no possible apparently - 4 courses menu might be too heavy especially for diner... Anyway the good thing is that they also have a vegetarian menu. So the 4 courses menu is at 88$ which is very reasonable however careful because it can get very pricy with some cocktails or wine on top. Special highlight for the vegetarian pasta and the passion fruit creme brûlée!!

@TheKuoKnowsProbably one of the best French restaurants in Singapore.There was a time when I would have ordered the Foie Gras without hesitation. But I opted for the Duck Rillettes instead. Same animal. But at least I don’t feel as guilty.It was then a toss-up between the Bavette and the Beef Cheek. I figured that the latter tends to be a little harder to come by. So that was my choice. I was glad I did. It was richness on a plate.Au Petit Salut delivered from start to finish. The waiting staff were attentive, courteous and knowledgeable. The food was magnificent. And the setting was salubrious.Very enjoyable

Went for dinner on a Friday night. Best accessed by driving; there is ample free parking. The waiter was attentive yet discreet, and service was flawless. Food was great; we had a set dinner (you save quite a bit compared to ordering a la carte) as well as an a la carte main dish and dessert. There might not be a huge variety on the menu, but everything we had was expertly prepared. We would definitely come back
4
We have eaten at Au Petit Salut many times. Recently we went for lunch and had their 3-course set lunch. We particularly liked, Half dozen baked Escargots, Duck Rillettes, Oven baked snapper, Trofie pasta & baby artichokes. The French duck leg confit was also good, however, the extra charge of $ 14 is too much. Of the desserts the Sea salt caramel and macadamia chocolate tarte was irrisistable and so was the Passion fruit Crème Brûlée. Service was, as always, good and competent. Highly Recommended
4
The 3 course set lunch is priced at S$39++ exclude coffee/tea. Starter, main and desserts each have a wide choice of 7 dishes. The final bill including a pre-meal drink, and coffee/tea with dessert is >S$60 per head. The ambience is cosy with lush green, and dishes are tasty and not overly focus on display and artistic display. A good place to show that you are a practical business partner

We went there for our christmas dinner.A good menu with 5 plates, all well cooked and nicely presented but:- we started with a glass of champagne : no single aperitive cake coming with it! We were obliged To ask for some bread. - as we spent 15 minutes outside for the aperitive time, we were then in a constant hurry To finish our meals (with the waiter turning around our table to check if we had finished )- Toilets were not very clean (i would not provide any unnacessary details...) which is hardly acceptable for a decent restaurant.To make a long story short, it's a pity that the chef is not helped by an "as nice environment" as the cooking provided. In particular, the soufflé was just fabulous.Wine list reasonnably furnished and price acceptable.
1
I tried to book an event. Called ahead if I can come to view location at a certain time (not during business hours). This was confirmed. I arrived and a cleaner told me all waiters are busy - he checked with them twice but no one attended to me (I waited 25 min). Certainly NOT a place to organise an event if you want professional and reliable service.
5
It’s a great restaurant with authentic food. The service is excellent too! I went here for a few times and all their dishes are excellent. There was once I felt the coffee was not so fresh so the servant changed 2 cups for me. Overall it’s a really wonderful and enjoyable experience

Au Petit Salut is in the Dempsey Hill area of Singapore and although secluded, being located among attractive trees and shrubs below street level, it is worth the effort to seek it out. Our taxi driver knew the place well. There is both inside and outside seating in lovely natural surroundings. There are options for choosing a set menu or al la carte; we chose a 3 course set menu which was very adequate in quantity and excellent in quality. The meat dishes and cheese platter were a highlight. Additional dishes can be added for a small cost and we paid a reasonable corkage for two great bottles of wine we brought in. The wait service for both the food and the wine, which needed special attention, was unobtrusive and very helpful. Prices are reasonable

Duck confit is nice.. Very flavorful.. The white cream sauce on it make is mouth watering.. First time trying duck foie gras, taste very similar to goose..
Cod fish taste normal..
Can consider mash potato as a sides, buttery and salty..
4
3 course Set lunch from 39++ with additional charges for tea or coffee. Loved to gaze at the birds amidst the lush greenery through the glass panels. Nice food and attentive staff too.
5
This is a great French Restaurant serving authentic French food. We shared the beef tartare for entree. thoroughly enjoyed this dish. For the main we had the beef and lamb. Getting blue beef is hard in Singapore, but this was just right. This was a superb meal and one we will remember for some time
2
Dinner with 2 others I have not seen in years. Each of us ordered a main which took a long time to prepare. This we disregarded because we had a lot of catching up to do. After 30mins, Waiter abruptly comes to our table with 3 scoops of lemon sorbet informing us that our food was overcooked. I asked whose order was affected as I would have accepted overcooked lamb so as not to disrupt the evening. Unfortunately, it was my guestâ€™s ordered that were messed up. Waiter then proceeded to place the bowl of sorbet on my table asking us to eat these first. This was not want we wanted to we sent him away.Next the floor manager came over with the sorbet again and informed us that these sorbets were on the house. That riled me and I repeated that point that we had not had any food apart from be bread and sour sorbet was not appropriate. If they were sincere about making up for the delays, at least provide us some savoury starters. We did not cause the food to be overcooked nor did we press the staff to speed things up. I found them pressing us to accept the sorbet as unacceptable for this establishment and provided the feedback.He apologised and backed away. In the end, they never made up for the blunder with free desserts of a discount off the meal.
5
This venerable venue has been around at the same location for at least 15 years if I remember correctly. I have not visited them for more than five years but oh boy the food is still as excellent as I tried for the first time. This is a must stop if you enjoy European style cuisine
4
This is my first time here - we went on a Saturday afternoon and had the set lunch menu. Food was spectacular. Quality food. Everything was great. Waiters were polite and accommodating and the ambience was just right. Although we said indoors, the outdoor area is gorgeous and perfect for a meal. I would definitely come back here again
4
Had lunch at Au Petit Salut.Excellent food - good presentation, decor, ambience and service.Ample car park space.Refreshing to have such good quality of service with staff speaking good English.The set lunch prices are reasonable considering the quality of the experience.Place to go to celebrate a special occasion
4
It was my sister's Jubilee birthday lunch and we had a party of ten that day. The food and ambience was pretty good. In fact, I enjoyed the appetizer which was escagots, the main which was duck confeit and dessert which was apple tart with raspberry ice cream very much. My mum did not like the chicken soup as her appetizer, so the restaurant kindly arrange for her to have a different appetizer which was scallops instead
4
Had lunch 3 times in the month. Food was very good accompanied by good service. Escargots were excellent. Bread was nicely done but a little disappointing as there was just ONE type of bread which gives u no choice or variety. Helpings a little bit too small for locals. All in a good experience.
4
I have no hesitation in recommending the set price menu here. Not only are the choices excellent, the food is well prepared and presented and represents excellent value.Just off Holland Road, near Tanglin Mall, this is a good quality French restaurant with well trained/attentive staff and skilled chefs.They were happy to provide gluten free bread rolls for us, which not everyone does.Wine is not cheap, but then again, this is Singapore where quality wine is never cheap.There is no view from the restaurant, so their food certainly needs to excel and they do not disappoint.I appreciate quality and dedication across various styles and restaurant price brackets.When visiting Singapore, this is one of a handful of restaurants that will always be on my list
5
Modern and casual restaurant with outstanding food ,must try lunch time amasing selection with very good value price ,very good service ,

I knew about the restaurant for many years but never went since I am actually not a big fan of French food. The venue is in a nice tropical location near the old botanical gardens and also walking distance to Dempsey Hill. The building is a bit different from the rest of Dempsey and lacks character. Interior is nice but aircon was very cold. The service was very attentive. Food was good but not spectacular. I ordered fish for my mains and it was fairly dry. All in all it was below my expectations. Will not return.
4
Lazy weekend lunch in a cozy environment with attentive service staffFor starters, the lobster ravioli in lobster bisque was good as was the pan seared scallops. The mains were great , we had the duck confit and braised beef cheeks with the house Pinot Noir We switch mains amongst ourselves and the service staff immediately provided fresh cutlery! Talk about attention to details.
5
Great atmosphere , excellent food, fantastic service. From the moment we arrived, the staff was very attentive and made sure everything went well. The dishes were succulent, from the foie gras to the duck leg to the mash potatoes. Desert was delicious too. We'll Be back

Dropped by for Friday lunch and ordered based on the waiter's recommendation from the set menu: smoked salmon for starters, duck leg confit for mains, and the chocolate gateau for dessert.The smoked salmon was good, the duck leg (despite strong recommendations from the waiter) was mediocre, the gateau was, put mildly, forgettable.Pros:Great ambience, especially at noon, when the outdoor seating seemed more alluring than indoor. The breeze blows pleasantly, and the surroundings are quiet, while still a stone's throw away from busier Orchard.The place is also well designed, with clean, classic finishes and high, airy ceilings.Cons:Aside from the forgettable food, the staff was over attentive (and a little too over assertive). Would imagine a more pleasant time if I were left alone every once in a while to enjoy a laid back lunch. But the constant checking in on how the food was, and asking whether I was done with my dish (and I was asked when I still wasn't done with it– an embarrassment for a restaurant that tried to do fine dining), turned what could have been a pleasant lunch into an uptight one.I also headed straight from the airport, where I grabbed takeaway coffee that I was still finishing up when I arrived at the restaurant. Didn't quite appreciate how the waiter had to remind me that outdoor drinks were not allowed. A takeaway cup of coffee that was just about to be finished? Really? A little pretentious, no?Overall: Not worth a visit for food alone. If you're after a respite, the place and ambience do justice. The service needs improvement– they must learn to let people enjoy their (average) food

This restaurant has been around for years. We haven't been here for awhile so we thought we'd try again. Food was nice enough. The dishes were more the classic type. They also have decent enough wine list. Ambience was okay - maybe better at lunch when you can see the outdoor.Service was also okay albeit it felt very amateur. Unfortunately this aspect is important to get right. Even though there was no bad incident (i.e., no spillage, no incorrect order, staff were friendly), having amateur waiting staff for what is a fine dining restaurant really weighs down on the overall experience
2
Went to Au Petit Salut (Salut) on a Saturday for the 3 course lunch. It was a sunny day in Dempsey and the ambient surroundings of Salut were at nice and cool.Unfortunately for my friends and I, the lunch did not live up to expectations.My friend's review is already logged here but I would only add that my first course was called a fattoush salad on the menu, which is traditionally a bread salad with a lemon garlic dressing. What I received was iceberg lettuce and capsicum in a vinegrette. The salad was so far from what I was expecting that I wasn't sure if the chef used the wrong recipe or if they were trying to make the dish sound more impressive by hoping the guests would not know the difference between a garden and a fattoush salad.I do not think that is a very good strategy in cosmopolitan Singapore especially given the fierce competition
1
Each time we waited for 30 to 45 mins for each order to come thro both appetizer as well as main course. We took friends out and it was embarrassing. Staff response to our feedback on the delays was nil. Service recovery was bad. Their excuse was that they had a large private party to attend. Then should not have charged everyone else service fee no? Will not go back again.
3
There were 4 of us for lunch and 2 of us had the set menu which for 3 courses is a very decent price until you find out that your choices don't even match the price. First the good: the Taglionili, Caprese Salad and the bread rolls were excellent. OK it stops there. The bad: the roasted snapper was nothing to speak of - hard, dry, overcooked and so-so. The Tartar de beouf had a darkish colour and was not quality meat. For a restaurant claiming to be francais, it's not something you could call OK even. And for sweet endings, oh dear, the cheese platter at an additional $10 was stunning expensive for the 3 finger sized pieces of very ordinary cheese. Of course it's international quality since we have to import them. The iced chestnut parfait was not a success - the 2 pieces of 'diluted' chestnut mousse with and a strange yellow bitter condiment do not a dessert make, Sadly the food was a great disappointment compared to the attentive service of the staff. They were very professional although one time, collected the dinnerware from the wrong side of the table. It has a lovely setting and the furniture was comfortable but the food which is what one comes for is far from the standards of the hey day. Unless you know what you are ordering, I would not return to find out that my choice missed the mark again

Wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner after work on a Friday and know of Au Petit Salut from online search (the restaurant we wanted to go to only has table available to us for one and half hour). The ambience of the restaurant was nice. We were placed to sit outside near the entrance (we were ok as it is nice to sit outside yesterday) - reason being my Friend was wearing slip in sandles as his feet hurts from a bump (they have dress code requirement to sit indoor which I find it kind of discriminating - food at Dempsey is generally not the cheapest - we paid $440 for two of us with a bottle of wine. We did not spend less because we wear slippers and Friday is dress-down day so why segregate people in that way). Food is good (we had Maine lobster tail, cod fillet, foie gras tart, 400 day grain fed Wagyu beef and cheese platter) and they have a list of good wine to select from. Service of staff is prompt too. Not sure if i will go back again but overall quite a nice place to relax; if you do not want to sit outside, make sure you dress up according to their requirement

Dropped by for dinner with my significant other and was greeted by great service and fantastic food.
The beef was well prepared and just melted in our mouths. Thanks for the lovely experience.
4
Really nice, fancy ... Very good for a business meeting, spent a fortune on wine ... If you want to take someone for a business meeting this is the place :)
4
classic french comfort food prepared the classic way. nothing molecular or fussy. service was thoroughly professional: attentive but not overbearing. excellent wine list with something good for every budget. recommend highly.
5
We came here on Singapore National Day and the mood was festive. Set three courses and selection was wide. High quality food, beautifully presented. Wine selection good but, as with all restaurants in Singapore, very expensive. A delightful lunch to celebrate.
3
Over the last few years, while competition has heaten up, the cuisine here has deteriorated, both in terms of quality and innovation; it's still not bad, but really nothing to write home about. The same goes for service - acceptable but lacking class. At this price level, why bother? The main asset is the countryside feeling in the middle of urban Singapore
5
Au Petit Salut is a delightful destination restaurant in a verdant setting of lush foliage. The welcome when you arrive is warm and hospitable, which sets the tone for a relaxed and high quality experience. Every dish is wonderful, but particularly memorable are the lobster bisque and homemade sausages. The former was rich and flavorful with satisfying lobster ravioli floating in the velouté broth reduction. The brunch menu is also excellent with well- executed staple egg dishes, as well as more exotic brunch creations. The ambiance is exceedingly pleasant and the service attentive and polished. Overall, aside from the excellent food, it's the gracious ambiance that makes this restaurant a cut above so many others where the atmosphere feels rushed and frantic. Highly recommend Au Petit Salut as a reliable standout that you want to go back to again and again
5
A restaurant that offers a pleasant and classical dining experience, Au Petit Salut delivers just that and so well. Not especially "in", or the latest place of the fashionistas, the restaurant delivers a classic dining experience with a great cuisine, competent service, a sound level that affords a conversational opportunity, and table spacing that avoids cheek to cheek contact and protects a degree of privacy. Surrounded by a country ambiance, and with outdoor dining on a comfortable terrace, the restaurant seems to be proudly traditional old school that is comfortable for the generations of yesterday, today, and tomorrow. That level of ambiance and outstanding food quality, presentation and service is costly so think $S100 per head for dinner, or more depending on wine selection. The clientele sees that as value, given the quality of the food ingredients, preparation and service. Parking is easy in a large lot. Most importantly, the staff seem pleased to have the opportunity of service to its clientele. That is such a rarity in today's world and that is how we came to respect Au Petit Salut
4
This restaurant has been around for a while. Its been a staple for most looking for decent French fine dining. However in that time, things haven't significantly changed. Food is good but not spectacular. Service is efficient but not memorable. It's not that cheap and there are many alternatives.

We ate dinner here, after having made a booking for a table via their web site in the late morning. The booking process was a breeze, and confirmation was received by email quite soon after.Au Petite Salute has been around since 1998. The cuisine is French, and the restaurant has many followers. Very popular at lunch time as many, including myself, have been there to eat their 3 course set lunch which is good value for the buck. But tonight it was for a special dinner. The service was attentive, polite and cordial. When my wife mentioned feeling a strong draft, the waiter immediately adjusted the blower of the air conditioner to lower this. The ambiance is quite plain, with floor to ceiling glass panels on both sides of the dining room, and the room ends decorated with red brick tiles. Warm lighting made the place very cosy and comfortable. A well stock bar occupies one end of the room. There was piped jazz music, not my favorite. I thought the atmosphere could be more romantic with a better selection of music. The single white tulip flower on each vase on every table looked pathetic! No WiFi. Not wheel chair friendly. Toilets in-house next to stairs.We had the 3 course set dinner menu instead of the 4 course as we both cannot eat much, ordering, for our starters, the Smoked salmon, with fresh vegetables, sour cream & dill, capers, micro herbs, with balsamic reduction; the Lobster Bisque with lobster ravioli, and fresh tarragon. The main course was a Crispy French duck leg confit, with roasted potato, caramelized onions, orange & Piment d’Espelette, and brown jus. My wife had the Red wine braised beef cheeks, with carrots, button mushroom, and Pommes Mousseline.For deserts, I had the Choux buns and vanilla ice cream, with warm chocolate sauce and sliced almonds; and my wife had the Creme Brulee with fresh Madagascar vanilla beans and chocolate pearls. This was finished with a coffee and a tea.The duck was pretty delicious and well seasoned. The skin was crispy, and the flesh tender enough to fall off the bone. I like the orange flavor, but found the Brussel sprouts a little undercooked. The Beef cheeks were tender, but I found the smell of beef too overpowering for my liking and would have struggled to eat this dish. My wife however, didn’t think this was so, but then she has problems with smelling due to medication affecting her smell senses. The deserts were very good. I enjoyed the crunchy almond bits and the vanilla ice cream with the chocolate sauce. My glass of red wine was obviously poured from the last drops of the bottle. There was so much residue that it was unpleasant to drink the bottom third of the glass, but at $18/- a glass, one tries not to waste too much!In all a pleasant evening which could have been better. A place which I would return for special occasions, and hopefully, find fewer negative points than tonight. Four stars for the moment

Had dinner here last night. It was lovely. We arrived early (thought it was further up the Hill and intended to have a pre-dinner drink there. But they have a bar and outside drinks area and we were well catered for at the restaurant.Range of set menus and a la carte.It was a mild night for Singapore and we ate outside. It is so nice to be out of the airconditioning.for a while. Strongly recommended for a special meal. My medium rare steak was a little over done, that ws the only criticism
2
Seem to be a well know address and you would expect some pretty impressive food looking at the menu prices but this is not the case.
Singapore has now plenty more options in the same price range but with actually good food and creative menu.
4
Both food and service were excellent. The service was quiet and unobtrusive. The food was very good and the restaurant had a good atmosphere.
4
Attentive service. Value for money set lunch. Need booking as it is usually crowded. I love the food from appetizer, main course and dessert.
4
Love the food of this restaurant. Service was good and prompt. Parking on the premises was no problem and free. The dessert also outstanding.
5
Went with my family for Sunday brunch. Food is excellent and value for money. Service is good and ambience is fantastic. We will certainly be back again in the future!
5
A group of friends got together for. Bastille Day celebration at Au Petit Salut. The food was outstanding. A wide ranging menu with something to appeal for everyone in our group of 10. The set course menu was well priced and covered an array of options which were all appropriately sized. The wines were well matched although a little pricey. The decor was fine. The service was a little on the slow and inattentive side, which I now understand is always a bit hit and miss in SG. The food was outstanding and enough to get me back there
5
Visited Au Petit Salut for dinner for the first time. Best multigrain bread, best roasted chestnut and mushroom soup, and the best "melt in your mouth" wagyu A4 steak done to perfection, crispy on the outside and pink on the inside. With an additional appetiser and coffee and desert for the 3 of us, the bill came to S$489. Worth it? Yes! Service and ambience was immaculate. Thank you Au Petit for a memorable evening. Will visit again? Yes

My wife and I celebrated our wedding anniversary by having a quiet dinner at this restaurant. This would make it my 3rd time dining here. The first was also with my wife for her birthday. The other time was a business dinner.Consistent quality of the food and attentive service makes this a place a true classic to come back over and over again for fine French cuisine. The restaurant is set in a location at Dempsey that gives one the impression that you are in the European countryside. The interior lighting is soft and romantic, but sufficiently bright to let you see what you are eating. The service is of high quality. Within minutes from my online reservation, I received a call from the restaurant to ask if I wanted a table indoors or outdoors. I chose indoors as the weather has been pretty hot lately.Upon arrival, the staff looked like they have been waiting for us all day and gave us a warm welcome. Amy, our service staff, was very friendly and gave us good recommendations. He was chatty and quite entertaining really...he made the dinner that more interesting.Food-wise, the lobster bisque and the duck confit were excellent. Special mention goes to the beef tenderloin which was made to perfection. The crab mouse was also wonderful. The only dish which was a little bit of disappointment this time was the duck foie gras. Don't get me wrong; it was good but somehow it did not give us the "wow" factor as compared to the foie gras at another restaurant down the road (which we recently dined at).Overall, I rate this restaurant highly and would recommend it to anyone looking for good clean classic French cuisine
4
This French restaurant in a standalone bungalow in Dempsey is a good place to go to if you want good service, decent food and nice ambience.There is outdoor seating as well as indoor air conditioned comfort. They have a function room too.My favourite safe lobster tagliatelle and ravioli with mushrooms. Yes I was wondering if French serves pasta:). Decent wine lists too
5
By far the nicest setup for all French restaurants in Singapore : nice black and White House, some nice and quiet outdoor seats which thanks to the fans are never too hot and a luxurious garden. Too choice if not on a budget for diners, great value for business lunches
4
very pleasant setting!Dempsey hill(Singapore)unique site! good service and nice garden like environment felt like an oasis with cascading waters! food "nouvelle cuisine" par excelence! tasty and to the point! "bravo! c'était bon"!j'y reviendrai!!!!will come back on my next trip.
4
Fresh, tasty food, and friendly, warm wait staff. The Seafood Platter was an explosion of umami and taste; the beef tenderloin was juicy, well-seared.
3
It's been sometime since I've visited the Harding Road branch. Highly recommended it to friends but after tonight's dinner, those who've been here were disappointed with the service and those who haven't been here were not impressed with either.
4
Good food, good staff but I can not describe it as great or exceptional.. In Singapore, you are bored, so you need to try different places.
5
A nice location with both indoor and outdoor tables. We opted for the outdoor.A great selection of food from the a la carte menu or the 4 course set menu. Considering it was a Tuesday evening we were just in the mood for a starter and a main - so we chose different starters, but the same main (the black Cod).All the dishes we had were nicely decorated, well sized, but most importantly great taste all around. The Cod is one of the best I have had. The artichoke that went with it - did't work for me, but that was minor.A good selection of wines as well.The staff were very service minded and attentive. Well done! We will be back
5
First Brunch at Petit Salut! Service as fantastic as ever. Food as great as ever. New menu with French delights. The Croque Monsieur was the best in Singapore so far and the wine selection always a good standard happy to come back and glad they now open on a Sunday.
4
I've eaten here twice, once on a regular Saturday night and once for our company end of year party in the private room. Enjoyed both occasions - the food is good, with the odd dish being absolutely superb - and the service is friendly. Nice ambience, and a decent wine list. Worth a visit if you're in the area
5
We are often going to "Au petit salut" with my wife and my 2 children (4,5 and 2 yo.), not only the food is fantastic and very affordable, but the ambiance, the place and the service is great! We always are welcome like being a part of the family and the waiting staff are friendly and attentive (especially Amy and Fid!). We highly recommand this restaurant
4
I have been to this place quite a few times. I think that it has one of the best quality French food at affordable prices (less than $80 a pax for a set with a glass of wine is what I consider affordable in Singapore for fine cuisine). They have a set lunch menu at $38++ but the bill goes up quite fast as most interesting items require a top-up. Nevertheless, all are really quite fine and good - though small - but I wouldn't recommend the poached egg, that was more of a common egg Benedict to me.You can't fault the place for the quality of the food, you could close an eye on the small portions, it is after all fine dining but I really think the service is lacking behind. Although it is the first time in a while that my red wine came filtered and without a huge amount of sediment - I had pointed out to the waiter on a previous visit that a place that charges $20 a glass shouldn't serve wine unfiltered - the service was good but not excellent as it should be in a 5-star hotel, assuming that is what this restaurant aim to achieve. We arrived at 1.30pm, past the peak hour and we had to wait for a busy waiter to tell one of his 3 unoccupied colleagues in another corner to welcome us, were attended to by a bossy waitress who rushed the order and swiftly moved away from the table without giving the time to ask for wine and after serving us coffee instead of tea as ordered, someone came back with the right beverage without even giving a choice of flavours. I am sure I may sound like a picky patron but even at $80 a pax, one ought to get the Royal treatment. A restaurant is not just about the food, it's about the experience as wel
4
Perfect, elegant restaurant set in a bungalow. meant for the discerning, quiet dinner person who wants something quite the reverse of Clarke Quay ! Choose to sit outside (where few sit) instead of the stuffy indoors...and bring out your best Barolo from home (they allow BYOB with a $50 corkage).Food is beautifully French 
3
Though the food and service is so so, this place has good embiance. Hopefully it will be better after the renovation.
1
tried to get in there for dinner but was turned away though they had a lot of empty tables. I suspect we were dressed casually.
5
This is undoubtedly one of the best places you can find in Singapore. The food is fabolous and if you get an outdoor seating, next to the waterfall on a good day, it is a very pleasant setting for a formal dinner. I have been here a few times and have never been disappointed. Their steaks are particularly nice and well prepared. Service lead time can be a bit long but with good starters and friends you shouldnt be bothered
3
I've been to this restaurant a few times. The outdoor table setting and atmosphere is excellent. The food is consistently good but, frustratingly, not great. For example, the "Seafood Platter" was good, particularly the delicious scallop, but the cod (small and over cooked) and squid ink couscous (too dry and lacking flavour) reduced the dish from great to good. However, the real issue with this restaurant is the service. The staff need training on basic customer service which was poor to the point of irritating even before the slow delivery of our food. I would go back to this restaurant in the hope that there is a little more attention to detail with the food and the management has got a grip on the service issues because this restaurant could and should be excellent.
4
We expected to be wowed by this fancy restaurant, unfortunately that did not happen.There were many positives though. The ambiance was elegant. as the restaurant was undergoing construction / renovation, there was no outdoor seating and we felt a bit boxed-in (The restaurant did call earlier to warn us about it).Service was attentive at times but patchy. Food was good (The French quail was excellent), my duck confit was tad too salty. worth another visit to see, if I have better experience next time
4
The food was fantastic. It is reasonably portioned and will take upwards of 30 minutes to receive once ordered. We ordered the cheese and fruit plate as well as the lobster ravioli bisque (note, the bisque is tasty but there is only one ravioli with lobster inside, so do not expect a lot of lobster throughout the bisque).There are set menus which we will likely try next time.Be sure to dress casual plus. Most ladies wear dresses and men wear slacks. The outside is very relaxing with small water falls and a quiet outdoor area.The service was not bad. It is that we had to wait sometimes to find a waiter to ask questions or get a drink refill. They were very polite however.Make this a place for a relaxing date night and plan on spending 90 minutes and perhaps a bit of money if you buy a good wine
5
Been here on 4 separate occasions and every visit gives me a reason to return. High quality food, service, and ambience every time! Any questions about the wine? Ask for recommendations from Fid, after explaining your preference and she gets it right every time! While the menu changes every quarter, the favourites are always on the menu. If you have a more robust palate - for starters, try the ravioli and the lobster bisque. For the mains, try the oven roasted quail stuffed with mushrooms and foie gras, or the tenderloin with red wine jus. Will be back again soon (

This is one of the places I went to when I want French food.The quality is probably one of the better ones but the pricing is still manageable and not in the range of the Michelin French restaurants in Singapore.Last went for lunch on a Monday and was surprised to see it nearly filled and only outdoor seats for walk in. If you want indoor seats and even on a Monday lunch, please take note to reserve. Was lucky to get an indoor seat after some waiting but that was probably due to us reaching in the later part of lunchtime rather than them having available table.The set lunch was good value and the quality no less inferior to their dinner

Hidden away in Harding Road (near Holland Road), best accessed by private car or taxies. They serve decent French food, and carry a good assortment of wines too. Service was good, and be prepared to spurge a little for dinner. Tried the snapper, pork shoulder and duck leg confit which were quite decent and well-prepared. Good and quiet ambience for a special occasion.

Au Petit Salut is the kind of place you go to for a classic, delectable French meal. If you're overdosed with truffle overflowing from menus all over Singapore, this is the place you go to. If you're looking for a lovely, peaceful evening with good food and wine, this is the kind of place you go to. Everything we ordered - from the Classic French Onion Soup and Foie Gras appetisers, to the steak and sea food platter which was then finished off with the Souffle - was perfect in it's preparation and taste. The service is friendly and welcoming, offering wine recommendations where needed.I'd definitely go back as much as possible

I do not recommend this restaurant. Even though the food is ok, just ok, all dishes are over priced. It's too expensive for the kind of food they serve.
You have plenty of other french restaurant to test before going to au petit salut !!!!

Beautifully located restaurant offering very nice French food in a quiet atmosphere. Overall quite pricey but recommendable for a special occasion. Portions are good size. Has both inside and outside seating options.

For French fine dining, the quality was very inconsistent. We had 6 dishes and only 2 of them were actually good, 1 avg, and 3 fairly poor. For the price, I expected better.Avoid the yellowfin tuna appetiser and the black cod (which tastes like regular fish at this restaurant).Foie gras appetiser was good though
4
A great venue for a mid week business lunch, great setting, exceptional service and delightful tasty food. The menu has a good variety and suits all tastes. Unfortunately it was a business lunch and I good not indulge in the wine selection but a great place for lunch or dinner and a place for a great meal
2
My wife and I had the set dinner. i'm not going to waste much time writing this review but just to say that three out of the 4 dishes were not good. My steak was dry, the fish didn't taste fresh and combinations of ingredients just didn't go. Think the emphasis is trying to impress with "show' rather than quality. I sent back my main meal.When I complained I was told it was one of the best selling items I guess to suggest that I may be wrong. Will never go back
4
Au Petit Salut is a nice discovery I was invited by a friend for dinner. Good setting.Well priced menu at 88+ with a nice range of options: foie gras, lobster, beef...There's a nice terrasse close to the entrance. Peaceful place with efficient service!Will go bac
5
This is a lovely little restaurant with an excellent a la carte and a very good value business menu. Having visited twice now for a business meal with a big party I can vouch that the service remains as good as when you are on your own and the food standard is also maintained. I will be bac

We came here with our family who have been here before using their entertainment App. During the ordering process, we specifically asked if an item was covered by the 2 for 1 offer and upon having that confirmed ordered 2 of the item. The waitress then read us back our order and asked if we would like to order anymore mains? Which we did and not once did she then say that by ordering a lower priced main we would negate the initial order that we clarified was covered by the App. When the bill came we pointed this out to the management who agreed that we were should have been informed but pointed out repeatedly to us that according to the conditions of the App the lower priced mains would be deducted. There was no apology and not even an offer to come to make things better by the management eg. Remove the cost of one of the deserts (which is still considerably less than the $150 that we thought was covered by the deal) All in all the situation was Badly and poorly handled, we even told them that as tourists we would be writing a poor review and that their choice to 'stick to the fine print' was a bad choice. Our entire dining experience has been completely soured by the experience and we can honestly say that we can't even say that despite all of this the food was good. It was definitely an experience that has left a bad taste and in a country where there is plenty of choice for fine dining this is one place that I would definitely NOT recommend. Like the previous terrible review I agree entirely that this restaurant is more concerned about money than customer service
5
Went to this restaurant located in a green area of Singapore. It was one of the best meals we have had in long time. We were seated outside and it felt as if you were eating fine dining in the jungle. Service was very good and we will come back next time in Singapore
5
Had the Le Menu (2 starters, 1 main and 1 desserts) dinner recently and it was a wonderful meal. From the first starter till the dessert, I was very pleased as each course really delighted my palette for French food. My first start was the Maine Lobster with green asparagus and cucumber - absolutely refreshing and delicious that whet my appetite for next course. It was followed by the second starter of seared duck foie gras with caramelised apple and spinach - very generous portion that is very smooth and melt in the mouth.I have selected seared fillet of black cod with shimeji mushroom and was very pleased with the tender and juicy fillet.Ended with home made date & fig pudding with vanilla ice cream for dessert and it was absolutely heavenly to end the wonderful dinner.As it was a Monday evening, the restaurant was not very packed and able to enjoy the nice ambience totally with great privacy. Will definitely be back to try the other choices on the menu
5
The restaurant is relatively expensive to dine but the dishes offered is cooked very well and there is a wide variety. We always have a wonderful evening at Au Petit Salut, and the wines recommended were always well paired with our entrees. Reservations definitely required.
4
Ambience is nice. The food is just as great. If you are wanting to have a nice first date, this restaurant would be nice. Relatively quiet environment but not cricket chirping silent. Definitely call to book a table.
5
Perfecly done duck, good wine, attending waiters. Indoor and outdoor dining, whatever you prefer. Going back later.

Au Petit Salut has become our favorite French restaurant in Singapore.We've been there several times over the years, and our experience has been consistently good.Our last visit was two days before Valentine's Day, again a very good experience. Most importantly, all dishes tasted great. The ambiance is not jaw-dropping as some other places, but still very pleasant, with a nice covered patio area.Our only negative surprise was that they had already racked up the menu prices two days ahead of the actual date (despite some items on the menu being unavailable)..
1
The reservation was poorly handled. A mistake was made on the date. I was not proposed any other alternative as it was full for wanted day. Food is overpriced, service is slow, restaurant is noisy. Careful for Valentin's day special: super overpriced menu, payment required in advance (never seen this before), "first come first served" even if you book online before. All they want is confirmed bank transfer. Very very poor service. What a shame for a "French" restaurant
5
I was apprehensive at first because there were some bad reviews. However, I probably was fortunate enough to taste the food of their better chefs I assume. The lamb was such a memorable piece, coated with mint. Even the potatos were remarkable. The steak my lunch partner had was so skilfully done. The mashed potato so tasty. Escargots were yummy. Dessert was again very fulfilling. Coffee was strong but again an applause. I will return for sure
4
This place has really attentive waiters. We are here for our wedding anniversary dinner, make reservations before coming, they seems to have limited seats and by 8pm it's all packed. Must try: seared foie gras / cod fish / nectar peach juice for those who aren't keen in ordering alcoholic drink it's like as if I'm eating a peach. Would love to come again.One of the things they can improve would be warming up the bread before serving
4
The lunch set menu is more reasonable compared to ala carte menu. Went there for team lunch and had a fabulous time. Reserve before going as it could get crowded even during weekday lunch time.Nice ambiance both inside and outside. Service is attentive (only complaint is they do not give bread unless you ask nor refill the empty plates).The fois gras, steak, Lobster soup, creme brulee were decent. The cocktail and mock-tail selection was good too. The price comes around 50-60 per pax after all add-ons. Bit pricey for the quantity they serve
5
This is very much a "sit back and relax" dinning experience. If you are in a hurry, expect fast food and fast food then this is not the place. But, for a quiet, relaxed evening, intimate even, with good wine, an excellent menu beautifully executed and pleasant conversation then this restaurant must be on your favourites list - in a city of great restaurants it is now on yours and we will be back. We thoroughly (perhaps an understatement) enjoyed escargot and bone marrow and beef tartare starters and mains of duck confit (perhaps a tad dry but with an excellent jus) and the outstanding seafood platter (scallop, prawn and incredibly succulent cod) before indulging in the delectable degustation of deserts (a platter of Creme brûlée, orange sorbet, chocolate fondant, berry cheesecake and profiteroles) which we shared and rounder off one of our best dinning experiences. A recommended wine is the super smooth and deep Haut Medoc. Price for 2: S$280Time: 2 1/2 hoursLeave your mobile phones at home, enjoy your meal, company and conversation. You won't be disappointed
3
Went there in April for the first time and was very pleased with both food and service.Last night we went back with friends from London for a birthday celebration.It was like visiting a completely different restaurant... the place was busy with corporate diners and we were attended by staff who seemed to be on their first training day with little or no grasp of English. The food was mediocre and attention to detail was entirely lacking.Definitely will not go back
4
I have been there many times and has always been absolutely perfect ! Good value for money, specially if you choose from the set menu.
4
Food was great and the staff made it a good experience. It looked like the food came in slowly-we where 15 pax- giving them benefit of being crowded:) I would return there for another dinner for sure.
4
This charming restaurant offers high quality French cuisine and an outstanding customer service.
My only complaint goes for the indoor dining as most of the times, temperature is really low. Luckily there is outdoor seating area!
5
I was there for lunch and I like the food. The fois gras is excellent. The ambience and service is also good.
5
This was indeed one of the best meals (and dining experiences) I've had in many years. The venue is delightful. There is an outside seating area which is quite intimate with nice landscaping around it. Inside is pleasant also and is understated in its decoration.Where it really excels is the food and extensive wine list. I had escargots served in bone marrow (very tasty) followed by duck with Brussels sprout and pomegranate in a light juice. The main course was truly exquisite and was sheer joy. Between the 3 of us, we had two wonderful bottles of red wine, topping off a wonderful evening.It would be unfair if I did not mention the service which was equally superb.This wasn't a cheap night out - it cost S$850, but it was worth every cent
5
My sister celebrated her birthday dinner at this restaurant and I would highly recommend it as a fantastic place to celebrate a special event. The tables looked absolutely beautiful and the attention to detail with vases of roses, printed gold menus and gold name tags made it look even more elegant. The staff were very professional and the service was excellent. They paid attention to detail but they were also very welcoming, addressed each guest by name and made everyone feel very relaxed. The food was excellent and the range of choice meant there was something to suit everyone's taste. The venue was beautiful with the surrounding gardens and we all felt we were in a very exotic location. I would like to thank Dee Dee and her wonderful staff for making my sister's birthday such a memorable occasion
4
Celebrated wife's birthday with a French dinner at this restaurant. It has been 2 years since I last had dinner here. Glad the food is still fine and the ambience is as usual great for a romantic dinner. We took the set dinner at $88++. Great appetizer of smoke duck and delicious foie gras. Main course of beef tenderloin is nicely done. We had a glass of Pinot and sparkling rose to go along to celebrate the occasion. Very nice experience overall . Will definitely be back again soon

When i first came to Singapore in 2007 ww started going to Au petit Salut. Its secluded location in the much sort after dining hub of Dempsey made it a very desirable place to have a quiet meal. Its lush greenery set in a period black and white and pristine french appeal was very alluring. However,the chef changed a few years ago and we found the new menu and the cuisine only average. For SGD 65 a steak it was not value for money. We had been going there twice a month for nearly three years. We found that after being patrons of that place for that period we were thoroughly disappointed with the inconsistencies that we had found. I would say it has the makings of a great place but they have lost their USP which was the food.To sum it up in short, would not go there again, unless they paid heed to all of the above mentioned points.
5
We visited for my wife's birthday. Beautiful environment with both outside and inside areas. The outside area has gentle waterfalls, creating a beautifully relaxed environment.We ate inside which, although a tad chilly, was beautifully decorated and extremely inviting.The food was truly excellent, with an emphasis on duck the night that we were there.Two of us went for the set dinner - a tasting menu - with the other two opting for a la carte. I can honestly say that there was not one dish that disappointed us - in fact, all were outstanding. The menu was coupled with an excellent wine list - though understandably not catering for my daughter's desire for a NZ Sauvignon Blan. However, the French wines on offer were well priced and good quality. They had a special on "Bin Ends" that really did offer value. Unfortunately we could not agree on any of these!I would thoroughly recommend this restaurant for a special dinner. Seemingly a bit formal but far from it. Service was prompt and courteous
3
Had a business/bday lunch here in a group of 10. We mostly ordered the set lunch, and most of them ordered the supplements (+$6 for this, +$14 for that, which is all the rage now in western restaurants)1 of the guests wanted a group photo taken and asked the waiter. The waiter brusquely said "hold on" as he was laying out the cutlery , and then walked away. 10 minutes later , still nothing and we had to ask another waiter and this time, did not take no for an answer. i think the restaurant must take such happy moments seriously, and not just look at the small picturethe starters started coming and moments later, the servers realised it was for another table. huh?a few minutes later, our real starters arrived, and my guest's starter was served to me. mistake #3 and i haven't even started eatingMy starter of smoked chicken salad was ok. My main of risotto was good, and my chocolate profiteroles with ice cream also goodOverall the food was good, though not mind blowing.But the patchy service was pretty mind-blowin
4
Good french food. The lunch sets (at least SGD 38pp) are consistent pleasers. Service is always prompt. Recommend you book a table. PErfect place to meet friends.
5
There was a time when Au Petit Salut was one of the only decent French restaurants in Singapore. Then along came an endless list of new places and it became easy to forget about the place. However, I recently hosted a small private dinner in the upstairs dining room and everything was perfect. The service was extraordinary and the food was excellent. I will be going back more often. And the set lunch is some of the best value in town
3
I went on a business lunch and we had the $38++ lunch that included a starter, main course, dessert and a coffee/tea. I enjoyed the flexibility that i was able to change the hot drink to an iced tea. There are many restaurants who are no longer as flexible. Service can still be better as staff were not friendly or smiling. I ordered a pork starter, the lamb main course & yoghurt sauce with the lychee sorbet in fruit soup. I must really commend the chefs for the very enjoyable food. It was simply delicious! The food was so good that we spent 50% of our business lunch raving about it.The down side of the visit was the terrible bites from the mozzies who feasted on us while we were feasting on the food! We sat outside as the staff said they had a full reservation for indoors. The management needs to look into this serious problem as i had more than 10 bites and the same happened to the 2 other guests who were with me. I will be back but only indoors for me
4
spare of the moment thurs night - we thought we might get a table and we did. the staff were very good here, attentive, knowledgeable and good eye contact. The menu was typically french and the chef is a bit arty by the looks of the presentation.this is a very comfortable restaurant (we were inside) and the right layout (space between tables, orientation etc), to promote a good atmosphere whilst being as private as possible - its not long line of tables like school halls.The wine list (important)! is a good selection of good well priced wines i think the fume was 80 or so, not bad. The food was very tasty, well prepare and the waiters knew where it came from, how it was treated etc. it certainly give confidence before the dinner arrives. We shared the chicken dish which is enough for two and it was excellent. we almost went for dessert, but the starter was very tasty and rich - so appetite well and truly satisfied. I liked this place, haven't been for 3 years at least and don't know why.... will be going again. I hear the lunch menu is great value

It was my birthday and what better than French for the one who loves anything French - culture, music, books, movies, history and yes, food!I loved the secluded setting of this classy, elegant French restaurant - the indoors exude old-world charm while the outdoors lends serenity from nature, with its gently flowing waterfalls and rocky walls. The ambience was totally tranquil, marvelously enchanting and romantic.My main course - Black Cod came next - another buttery smooth delicacy but with the light, fishy succulence instead of the heavy richness of the appetiser. The lobster bisque that graced the fish was awesome - it was the icing on the cake! The Venison Loin was also served - another tender chunks of savoury delicacy that sprang to life in the mouth. The venison loin was chewy and boosted of the richness of beef, but came with a slightly gamey hint - subtle, easily masked with the lovely sauce and cream it was served with.For more detailed information and photos, do grace the following:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/dinner-at-au-petit-salut.htm

We had the escargot served in bone marrow, mackarel and mayo for appetizer. These were indeed appetizing despite the portion is truly petits. Lamb and Confit au canard for a the mains were ok, we had wine and cheese, too. Selections of wine and cheese were great. There is a sommelier to help us to choose the wine, and cheese selection was served with a trolley was nicely presented. If you're looking forward to have a feast, here's where you'll be disappointed because you'll be served with high quality gourmet food where attention to detail is given to its quality. Despite the pricing and presentations, this is a casual dining restaurant and not a fine dining where you can experience a real taste of french foods as that in France (not the ambience though). Ambience is very friendly for all kinds of occasions and crowds. Overall must try
4
We were considering to visit either Boathouse or Au Petit for our valentine dinner this year and I am so glad that we made the wise choice!Au Petit has always been one of our most favorite French restaurants in town and it has never disappointed us. We celebrated this special occasion there 2 weeks ago and once again, we were impressed by the quality of food, friendly staff and great service of the Chefs and manager.Our five course dinner were prepared very well, the starter, follow by the soup, then Hokkaido scallop, then the main course... The food were heavenly. However, the desert was so-so. Nonetheless, we had a wonderful time there that evening
4
Have been here couple of times and it never fails to impress me. The outdoor area is so relaxing, you can hear crickets while dining. I find that charming in this lovely concrete jungle. :) They do have an awesome value for money set lunch. The last time i dined there, they had this lovely soya cake with popping candy! It was soooooooo good and it brought me back to my childhood
3
Celebrated a special occasion and decided to have lunch at Au Petit Salut as had dined there before but was totally disappointed as the food quality and flavors wasn't as good as my previous visit two years ago? Anyway, the make up of the food disappointment, at least the ambience was nice .Perhaps might give this place a miss as its over rated and pricey
4
Visited to try the set lunch menu at $38++ for 3 courses. I had the soup of the day (cauliflower), the lamb, and the coconut crÃ¨me brulee. Washed it down with a glass of the house white wine ($8++ each) and 2 glasses each of the house red (also $8++ per glass), and then finished with a glass of dessert wine at $17++. Total bill for 2 came to around $185 all in. Overall very good value for money and I would certainly consider visiting again
4
The ambience is good, the food delicious and service attentive.
Location is central and parking convenient.
5
Service and atmosphere is very good. There is inside and outside sitting. Food is exceptional. It is a bit pricey.
4
Everything about this place is fine dining. From the service, food, wine and ambience this is one the nicest places to dine in Singapore.If you want a special night out with friends, family or romantically this is one to recommend and you won't be disappointed
4
I went there witnessed a friend for lunch. We ordered the set lunch. She had the fois gras (lovely, she said), braised beef in red wine (also lovely) and a profiterole-like dessert (not bad). I had a mushroom truffle soup (great), a polenta main (also great with its cream cheese in peppers, chopped up olives and all) and the same dessert. Besides the food, liked the surroundings - away from the concrete that is this island
5
I was there last wednesday with my partner for dinner at harding rd, and this place is magical at night. We were enticed with the warm lightings and the garden setting. We had a little corner at the alfresco area and we were treated to a symphony of crickets chirping and suburban frogs croaking sans mozzies!We ordered the burgandy snails wonderfully presented on a bone marrow and their famously sinful pan seared foie gras. The plating was very beautiful for each dish. For mains, we had an amazing baked black cod and a breast of duck. The cod was simply prepared, allowing us to really taste the freshness and flavor. The duck breast was so lovingly prepared that it breaks apart with a fork! Both were beautifully-created and amazingly delicious, all thanks to the talented Chef Paul Longworth!We were wonderfully surprised by the creme caramel. I know, you must be asking, what so special about creme caramel? I tell you, you have to try this version by Chef Paul to believe it
5
This place reminds me of one of those cottages in countryside Europe, especially if you are seated outside. I have been coming to Au Petit Salut for many years, and though they have evolved and changed thru the years, they have managed to maintain a lot of integrity in the food
4
We had just returned from a visit to Paris, and when our friends took us to Au Petit Salut, we were not disappointed.This is a very nice place in an area called Dempsey, which used to house military barracks and offices some time ago.Service was excellent, all food was explained clearly, even the origins of some of the produce.On ordering our entree we were told it was not available, we placed an alternate order, which we were then told was also not available ! However amends were made with a beautiful, Alaskan crab salad, delicious, plus a complimentary prawn Bisque which was delicious.Confit Duck leg for main was outstanding, crispy skin with meat that fell off the bone.An exstensive list of french wines were also available.I would reccomend this place to anyone who enjoys good french food, prepared with care and detail.As good as anything we had recently in Paris.Atmosphere was relaxed but with class
5
My colleague came from France for a holiday in Singapore. Her friends had proposed this restaurant because the Indonesian restaurant next to Singapore civilization museum was full. You will have to take a cab or private transport in order to get access to the restaurant. It is not some restaurants located by the main road or near shopping center. Having said that, it was a pleasant surprise for me. We had booked 6 outdoor seats and it was quite cozy and windy with the greenery surrounding. I had ordered piña conada for my drink, a dinner set comprised of duck foie gras with balsamic vinegar as entree, duck leg confit as main course and a dessert (I couldn't remember the name but it was a 3 layer cake with vanilla ice cream). I must say everything was perfect and the price (78++ excluding my piña conada) I think it was quite okay for the food quality and ambience I got. It was nice to have gathering there. It was a relaxing meal. I would recommend my friends to go there for friend gathering
5
Given the plethora of high profile French chefs with eponymous restaurants in Singapore, Au Petit Salut stands out as a quality fine dining experience in a beautifully landscaped setting on Dempsey Hill. Around S$150.00 per head will reward you with foie gras and wagyu beef, served on slate plates upon an imaginatively lit outdoor terrace where water trails across pebbles - perfect for the cooler evenings of steamy Singapore. Service is attentive and the cellar contains many bottles of superior French reds. The staff were happy to substitute desert with a selection of superb French cheeses. A charming and worthwhile experience for the sophisticated traveller
3
They used to be a very good restaurant doing french cuisine at a reasonable price. Now, the food is bland and the portions small. The restaurant is indistinguishable from the myriads of restaurants that concentrate on plating and charging high prices for morsels of food, all in the name of healthy eating and quality produce regardless of the truth
4
Cosy and inviting, Au Petit Salut is a gem in Dempsey. The food is wonderful and ambiance also gets full marks. Must visit.
5
Every time, the food is excellent. Always pleasantly surprised by how the dishes turn out. The taste and flavour are discernible. Will always look forward to the next time.
5
Had dinner there last night after having not been there for about 2 years. The food was simply divine and the service almost perfect. Because of the haze, not many people were out and about but the indoor seating area was almost completely full. We used to go there fairly often since about 2 years ago as we felt their standards were dropping but they seem to have come back strong! Definitely a venue to consider when planning a special meal for a small group
4
My wife and I had eaten here once before and we wanted to go back because she loved the Duck Confit. We took two friends with us and we had an excellent dinner. We ate off the set dinner menu which of course featured the star attraction! The service and oval ambience were very good and we even slipped in a cheese selection before dessert. Great value and a notch up from most of the Dempsey area restaurants
1
Quite expensive. Avoid the fois gras in the menu, it is terribly fat (I am from South West Part of France, btw). The meat I ordered was a bit cold, the potato mousseline COMPLETELY cold. The birthday cake was a joke. The service was quite slow. The cheese is terribly expensive. Avoid the chocolate creme brulee, it is not well cooked. Service quite friendly, though, it is the only good point I can possibly think of. I am nothing like a gourmet, I never write in any review website, I dont think I am demanding, I am not working in any of the competition but I was just very and honestly disappointed, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. I sign my review: Pierre Gidet. I was there last saturday night
4
These were what we tasted:1. Half dozen baked Burgundy snails, $15 2. Baked black cod, $40 3. Rack of lamb, $46  4. Quail, $60 5. Degustation plate of desserts (consists of Warm chocolate cake, a scoop of vanilla icecream, mini Crème Brulée, mango passion sorbet and a dessert made of tofu), $26A truly authentic French fare. For those who have stayed in France long enough to taste its authentic cuisines (from different regions) and missed it after coming back from France, this is the place for you to get back the nostalgic feeling (with a high price for our standard :P). We appreciate it quite a lot. The ingredients used are fresh. For each dish, the sauce compliments the meat so well. The quail and lamb are cooked medium rare which retained its juice in the meat and still tender. The snails are not very special though. The desserts, hot and cold was a hit (except the tofu dessert, not to our liking).(The restaurant changes its menu every half yearly.
5
The food was the best I have ever tasted. I had the set meal. For starters, I had parsnip soup which was creamy and had an amazing taste; even if you don't like parsnip, the soup would still have your taste buds dancing. For main course, I had snapper with prawn emulsion (which goes very well with the soft light snapper) and seaweed tartare, which was amazing. For dessert I had a chocolate mousse cake slice with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream. The service was extraordinary and efficient. The waiters/waitresses were polite and patient.
5
We come here every 2-3 months because of the great food, solid service and very good value (especially for Singapore where everything is over priced!). Foie gras is very good and usually part of the fixed price menu - yum! Beef and fish are well done also...and don't miss the desserts
4
Went there of CNY eve with my partner - celebrating the event at a non-Chinese restaurant for the first time. We were warmly greeted by the waiters when we arrived and were quickly shown to a nice little corner.Food selection was great and the alcohol variety was adequate. Prices were reasonable at SGD88++ per person for a set of 4 dishes. We had the foie gras, crab, duck and cheese and the food was lovely. The drinks were good and the atmosphere was equally astounding. We will return
2
I did not find anything special about the food in this restaurant. The menu is really expensive, specially because the food portions are extremely small. I think that people go there just so they can show off. As for me, I'd prefer to pay for good quality food and I would not mind paying a high price as long as I do not leave nearly as hungry as when I went in
4
Good French food. Go for the set lunch which is more worthwhile.
Service can be improved as waiters never look around to see if guests need attention.
4
Lovely for a quiet lunch or dinner. Food fresh and delicious. Ambience pleasant. Hard to get to if your taxi driver doesn't know how to get to it.
3
The food is really great and very tasty, the ambience is very quite and beautiful. this is one of my favorite restaurant here so far.
5
Food delicious. Service perfect (which is a first in Singapore the land of poor service). All food arrived at the table within minutes. Great place for a special night out - looking forward to going again.
5
The price was good for a French set lunch included appetizer, main course, and dessert. Just that you need to make a reservation because it is always full.
4
Nesteled away in lush green in the Dempsy area is this little French restaurant. Food at lunch was very delicious and light, atmosphere very nice combined w good service. Perfect place for a quiet business lunch, with easy access and free parking.
5
Perfect for special occasion dinner (wedding anniversary!) or lunch with the ladies. Food impeccable, service to match. Nice prix fixe for lunch, but recommend reservations.
5
A good French restaurant with good service and a nice setting!
Get an al fresco table!
Lunch and dinner, both are good options!
If you'd add L'Angelus sense of traditional restaurants, you'd have a perfect shot!
4
Ok the place is precious. The service was excellent. The meals are tiny as if the French don't like to eat. The food was good but I have a hard time with high prices and moderate servings.
3
Au Petit Salut is a fine dining french restaurant in Singapore. The decor and layout of this place is brilliant as well as the service and food presentation. However, the food itself is not that great, the portions are too small and very costly. Do I recommend? Hmmm....its good for a one time try/experience
5
Wonderful starters to main course to choose from, but remember to leave room for desserts and share among your friends so that you can try everything! Love their profiteroles & creme brulee specially!
4
Excellent quality food, prepared with great products.
3
Went there for dinner. ordered the 3 course set dinner and wine.
I think the menu is quite classic, not much surprises.
Food quality was good but not "wow".
It's a great place for quiet weeknight dinner for 2 or for business dinner.

My work colleagues treated me to dinner at Au Petit Salut, a fine dining French restaurant occupying a 3-storey building at Harding Road. I drove but had difficulty in locating the place at night. The place was nicely decorated, great atmosphere and offered both indoor and alfresco dining. The 6 of us sat outdoor which was nice, but unfortunately I did not really enjoy the food much which was not the fault of Au Petit Salut. The food quality and its presentation were ok, but I felt the nature of French cuisine must be consumed in a cooler environment. The hot/humid weather that night might have spoilt my enjoyment of the food. Given the opportunity, I would return (but to be seated indoor) and give this place another try

Having recently moved to Singapore my husband booked this as a surprise for our wedding anniversary and we weren't disappointed. We choose the set menu for 78 dollars as we liked all of the options on the 3 courses. The food was outstanding as was the discreet and professional service. Would highly recommend

It's been almost 2 years since I last dined at Au Petit Salut. The food is still great ; service was a comdey of errors.Things started well as the waiter did a good job of selling as he persuaded us to have a couple of appetisers although we intially said 'no'.Pre -dinner drinks did not arrive even after 2 reminders, it came after the appetiser was served and they got my friend's order wrong.(serving a red instead of white wine) I had ordered a champagne and was hoping to have it before the meal and something else with the meal. Although both the soup and escargots were good, I did not enjoy the champagne with the soup. When the mains arrived they got my friend's order wrong. They also completely missed out on the extra order of sides.. by then which we were quite wary as what else could go wrong so did not remind them.Because it took another 10 -15 min to cook I had finished my mains when hers arrived.To top it all, when they presented the bill they informed me that they had accidentally used my credit card for another table's ....!Throughout all this, neither the waiters, bartender or cashier knew of the other's errors.Unfortunate...

Au Petit Salut has been around for a long while. It has a reputation of serving good value traditional French. For some reasons I've not visited earlier though I was aware of it for a really long time. So recently I decided to drop by for lunch to find out for myself if it's that great.Well, I was a little disappointed. The set lunch was reasonably priced ($36 before taxes). But I was not bowled over by the food.I love to order duck for French but on this occasion I skipped the duck salad in favour of the escargots. Good choice as my friend's order of the duck which I stole a piece of was bad. Tender but still bad. Another friend ordered the same appetiser as me and we both agree that the escargots would be better without the tomato puree which overpowered the garlic. It was fine but we longed for a stronger garlic taste. The stuffed tomato with Raclette cheese was not bad.My main of braised lamb shoulder served with pearl barley was a tad big in portion for me and was just a bit much for lunch. It was tender but not memorable. However, I do like the barley. Friend's beef order looked unappetizing. Another's chicken turned out slightly better than expected.My best course was the dessert. My order of creme brulee was simple but good. Friends' orders of choux bun with ice-cream came a little melted.No service was apparent for my friends who were in the restaurant before I arrived. Even after I was seated for awhile no water was offered for any of us nor did any waiters came forward to have our order. However further into the meal one of the waiters came by and provided very friendly service from then on.I was let down probably by expectations. Doubt I'll return unless in the vicinity

We've been coming here for years and we've never had a bad meal. The 3-course lunch set is great value and it's available on Saturdays too. Just remember to book in advance. Best French food I've had outside France. Coffee's good too. Wish I could come here more often. But, maybe that's a good thing cos I'd gain too much weight!The menu changes occasionally but everything I've tried was always good. Good standbys are the hanger steak and the duck confit. I just wish they still served that with green lentils. The escargots are always good too. Bon appetit

I went here for lunch with friends. The place is really nice to sit in and we were warmly greeted and sat in a lovely spot, it was fresh and clean with glass and lots of plants. We went for the set lunch at $36++ though the price of wine bumped this up.I had the duck cured breast and salad, it was the only course I was slightly disappointed in as it was lacking something and was rather bland. I then had lamb stew with barley which was just beautiful, it was filling and very french.The waiter did come round and ask if I would like ground pepper and I said to him 'I would like to taste it first please', and it would have been nice if he had come back or if we had had salt and pepper on the table.Pudding was lovely, puffs with ice cream and nuts, coffee was good and strong. I'm giving a four for this restaurant as I also don't think we should have to pay extra for a mint tea bag, that is a bit silly.All in all I will go back, it was very good and the staff were lovely, all food was served together which we did comment was so nice being in Singapore

After a less than wonderful experience at 57 this was perfect. I wish the chef at 57 could perhaps attend training classes. I had lunch, the soup, chestnut and mushroom veloute was very very good, and the desert a simple fruit salad was tinged with some slight flavor and was superb

Great set lunch and location for Ladies who Lunch; lovely ambience for both lunch and dinner.

I can suggest Au Petit Salut for a romantic dinner, or just if you want to eat really good French dishes. Tartarre is delicoius...and the desserts as well: I tried the creme brulée and it was fantastic!
4
The atmosphere, the service and the burgundy snails with garlic butter and tomatoes. the Casoulet of Duck Confit and pork sausage, French bacon, lamb meatball in white beans and tomato sauce, beautiful.
4
A little pricey, but if you go for the set lunch menu, it is worth it. SOme yummy items on the menu, try the Burgundy Snails.

The taxi driver had to use his GPS to find the restaurant, which was a little awkward, but once we arrived at Au Petit Salut we felt totally relaxed as the exterior of the restaurant has a quaint charm about it. Choosing to sit outside made a refreshing change, as it was not too hot a night by Singapore standards and different from being in air conditioning which is usually the case when dining out in Singapore. The service was good and the food was fantastic (we went to Au Petit Salut on a recommendation). The cuisine is well plated and flavors were outstanding. Highly recommend the duck foir gras and the confit of duck. We both had the set menu with different mains and desserts and shared it between ourselves. Price wise was a little steep, with the bill at S$375 (including wine), but worth it
4
The food was delicious, as per usual, and the service was good. A must try is the duck confit. Suggest that you go for the business/executive lunch, which retails for around S&38, as dinner could be expensive, particularly if you include wines. There have several restaurants, though we prefer to go to the Dempsey Road branch (previously home of the Junior Flying Club). Good for business lunches or romantic dinners

My husband and I had dinner here to celebrate our anniversary, on holiday and in transit and just in Singapore for a few days. We didn't want to go overboard with price, but we wanted somewhere nice and romantic. Au Petit Salut was a good choice - found after researching on the internet. It was easy to reserve a table through their website. The food was very good, classic French with the occasional twist. The lobster I had with a citrus foam as an appetiser was excellent - I still drool at the thought of the combination of flavours. Duck of course for main course, which was good, but the sides weren't really up to the quality we expected (though the straw potatoes - despite being difficult to eat - were very more-ish). An abundance of rich desserts to choose from, including enough to indulge the chocoholics we are, and they were delicious. There was also a huge wine list. Of course being a French restaurant it was full of French wines - and the wine we chose was nothing special. It seems to be a misguided status thing, but I can't understand why restaurants in Asia don't branch out and serve some of the excellent New World wines that are much better value and quite frankly better quality than many of the European wines they serve. Disappointing wine aside, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal, the service was excellent but understated, and the restaurant has nice contemporary but understated decor. It would have been too hot for us to sit on the terrace, but if you were acclimatised to Singapore weather, that would have been a pleasant option.All in all, we were pleased with our meal, and would have no hesitation in recommending it

Went with friend for $35++ lunch set menu. Half dozen baked Burgundy snails with tomato and garlic butter is good as a starter, on the rich side but not overpowering. My main is risotto and it is slightly too cheesy and filling (esp. for hot climate like Singapore). The presentation and taste of dessert are very good. Overall, it's a nice place for lunch. Decent choice with no surprises. Outdoor seating is kind of in the shade, so it's ok for Feb

Went for lunch with some friends, after being recommended to go. We all had the set menu, which for lunch is quite reasonable and there are selections on there to suit most people. It should not be necessary to resort to a la carte. Food quality was very good for all of us. We ate outdoors on the deck, which is surrounded with greenery. It rained hard when we were eating, which actually added to the tropical atmosphere. In the evening, this it probably quite a romantic spot, although for lunch I would describe the atmosphere as more "subdued". It is quite a good place to have a business discussion, because the background noise level is low, although you do end up eavesdropping on the next table. The restaurant is in a house with nothing immediately surrounding it. There is off-road parking for those who arrive by car.The wine list is quite good, although I had to send the first bottle back, as it was badly oxydised; the first time I have had to do this in a couple of years. The manager was quite good about it and accepted it back, although it was the only bottle of that type he had, so I was forced to choose a different one.The service was ok, but a little slow, which was disappointing because it was not full when we went. I would probably come back here if offered the chance, although now with so many good French restaurants closer to town, I may go to one of those first

Was here for lunch today with my beloved wife. Made a reservation before I arrived as I understand that this place is always packed for lunch.Reached at 12pm and the restaurant is still pretty empty, with a few tables occupied. The restaurant is located along Harding road and i believe the restaurant is actually an old house, if I am correct. Parking space available outside the restaurant.We had the set lunch priced at $35++. Number of dishes to choose from the starters to the mains to the desserts. Both of us ordered the escargots for starters and they were great. Love the sauce that comes with the escargots. Dipped my bread in this sauce and literally cleaned up the plate with my bread.I had the pork belly and my wife had the beef. Like the presentations of the mains. However I find my sauce for the pork belly overpowering. As such I can't really taste the pork belly. My wife's beef tasted pretty good. Loved the freshly fried fries on my wife's plate. Both of us ordered the Creme brûlée for desserts. I enjoyed it but my wife finds it too sweet and too much. Good problem as I can help to finish it.Ended the lunch with a cup of hot coffee that comes with the set lunch. Ambience was pretty relax and conducive for conversation. We had the tables outside and it was not too warm, though it's afternoon in Singapore. Service was good with the servers refulling our glasses constantly. Value for money French food for lunch

This is a great spot near to Tanglin, which offers set lunch menus with some high quality food for a reasonable price. It is busy at lunchtimes so you need to book ahead of time.

One of the best French fine dining in Singapore. Price is ok and service is very good. A memorable place.

Nice friendly atmosphere, good menu choice, all the food was delicious.
Only complaint would be they were quite slow bringing out the main courses.

The restaurant is located in Dempsey and it is quite expensive to dine casually, much of the food is cooked very well and there is a wide range to choose from, but beware, if you are heading to the restaurant on weekends, when there is typically a big lunch crowd, or dinner time on Saturdays or Fridays, it is best to make a reservation before you arrive and then be prepared to wait for the food to reach the table. The wait may sometimes be worth it depending on what you order, the escargot, snails, are a treat, and even though expensive they are soft and the butter sauce is at the perfect tenparature when they arrive at the table

Went to this restaurant for lunch after reading other reviews and was not disappointed. It's a little out of town in the embassy district but worth the effort. On booking we were told there were no inside tables available but this turned out to be a bonus as it has a delightful alfresco area surrounded by lush gardens and water features. It was even raining heavily this day but only added to the atmosphere. The menu for lunch is a choice of 2 set menus but with plenty of options. The food was superbly cooked and presented. Service attentive but not intrusive. Not purest French food but a great adaptation

I used to visit Bistrot Petit Salut and this was the first time to visit. I was always enjoted at Bistrot so I had a high expectation. It was my wife birthday and I ask to order (not asking free. I mentioned to pay for it) a cake on my booking (few days ago). The staff said "we don't have cake but we can arrange birthday plate for dessert" Can't day bake a cake as special request? I said I pay for it. Looks thier is no kitchen staff who can bake birthday cake.On actual day. The service was really terrible. I mentioned it is a birthday occasion and put us in squeesy and tiniy corner and there is no ambience. I saw two guys are sitting on comfortable table at the window side.I order the food and order the wine later. by the way they didn't ask any apperitif and only asked for water to upsell thier revenue. No concern about special occasion.The galss of Chapagne came very late and my wife starter came first and mines came after more than 5mins. It is only two guest. how come they can not serve on same time? At that moment, my wine was not served yet. I asked to the staff and it was obviously forgot my order. All along the service staff looks not trained and don't know even basic procedure. My glass was always empty. no refill of bread. and every time, our each dish came in a very different time and always asking who's dish.After finish the main course we were choosing the dessert and the staff suddenly bring thier chocolate cake for my wife which my was don't like. The servie was totally a disaster and ruined my wife's birthday. It was a casual dining service with high end restaurant price. Seriously no worth to repeat. I still prefer to go Bistro because the price is worth for food and servic

APS is my go to French restaurant for Saturday lunches. I find their food of extremely good quality and taste and very reasonably priced for 3 courses. The restaurant has alfresco and inside seating and is usually booked on Saturdays and hence it's recommended that you reserve a table in advance and ensure that you are there on time as they don't hold tables for more than 15 minutes. Also, do check on children policy as I have a faint recollection that they don't allow children inside (but I could be wrong). They have two lunch menus, the higher end one has better dishes but fewer choices. They do serve foie gras and rib eye steaks in the higher category menu, but are charges an additional $15 for both items. The regular menu has about 5 appetizers usually including escargots, a soup, a couple of salads and one option for vegetarians. The main course has one dish of each beef, chicken, fish and pork and a couple of vegetarian options as well. The desserts are superb too, the choices usually are creme brulee, fresh fruits, profiteroles, some fruit based dessert such as pear tart and I think ice creams. I love the beef cheeks, never eaten beef this tender, almost melts in your mouth. The escargots are tasty too. Their salad portions are quite filling and have good quantity of fish to go along. My wife usually goes for the soup and finds it quite tasty. For desserts we usually order profiteroles and some fruit based tart or pudding. Their drinks menu has a page full of 1-for-1 promotions during lunches including cocktails, soda based non-alcoholics and mocktails. The awesome meal is rounded up with a nice cup of tea or coffee. For those wanted to spend a lazy Saturday afternoon eating great food, I'd strongly recommend APS.In case you've never been before, tell the taxi to take the Minden Road left from Holland Road and then a right onto Harding Road. APS is barely 50 meters down Harding

Whilst this restaurant's food is pricey yet commendable, I would like to add another dimension to the reviews for Au Petit Salut. I was dining at the restaurant with a friend of mine and had paid for the bill via my credit card. For some odd reason, I forgot to take back my credit card and accidentally left it behind. It was only a few days later that I realised that my credit card was missing. A quick call to my bank revealed that the restaurant had on their own accord, informed my bank of my lost credit card and asked for it to be locked down for security purposes.I would like to thank the staff of Au Petit Salut for their honesty and going the extra mile in taking care of their customers even after they had left the restaurant.

My husband and I made reservations late in the day on Saturday for Saturday evening dining so we didn't get the best seat on the patio so I would advise reserving early. The restaurant was full with a large group event but service was very good. There was a quite a wait between courses but they did offer more bread. We enjoyed the meal- my husband said that it was the best beef that he's had here in Singapore and I enjoyed the cod. We shared a great dessert and decided that this was restaurant where we will return

Went there on New Year's day for lunch. The lunch set is SGD30++. Reasonably priced. Started with es cargot. Taste fantastic. Main course for me was the onglet beef. Taste was alright but a tad too chewy. I guess you cannot expect a tenderloin for that price. Dessert creme brulee or orange de marnier (something like that) were fantastic. Service was ok as we were not in a hurry. We sat at the patio area, surrounded by the greeneries. Weather in Dec/jan is nice and cool. Overall, we had a great time

Enjoyed their set 3 course set lunch at an affordable price. Great way to laze your afternoon away from the hectic city.

I made a reservation over the phone and told the waiter that i wanted a side table for more privacy as it was my friend's birthday. Without hesitation the waiter asked for the name of the Birthday Gal. On the day itself, we were greeted with smiling faces and had a waiter that was assigned to wait on our table. Service was prompt and he was very obliging. We ordered cocktails but the wrong drinks were served. He came back with the right drinks and apologise profusely.Food: Starters. Scallops and Escargot were good.Mains: Duck confit-Excellent..not too saltish and the skin was really crispy. Pan Roasted Tenderlion..cooked to perfection as requested. The Pepper sauce which it was served on was too saltish. The mash potatoes was smooth and creamy.Desserts: We ordered Mont Blanc ..a must try for chestnut lovers..Creme Brulee--medicoreThey gave a us a complimentary Warm Fondant and had a candle and my friend's name written on the plate..How thoughtful and sweet. The fondant was divine.Overall, we had a pleasant and lovely evening at Au Petit Salut.

Service and food was so so. Could have been better for such a fine dinning restaurant.

Hearty traditional cooking and a much nicer atmosphere than their previous location at Jalan Merah Saga.

Nice ambience, great food and selection of wines.

Good service, great ambience!

Authentic French cuisine. Not fusion at all. Very refreshing if you are tired of commercialised western cuisine. Ambience is excellent too and free parking! Nice place to chill after a satisfying meal too.

Excellent food that's well executed and presented. Definitely going back!

Delicious Food coupled with Excellent Service

Great value during lunch! Prefer sitting inside cause it's too hot in the alfresco area. My girlfriends love the duck confit but the fish suits me fine :) Choux buns with choc fudge is yumssss....But I'd prefer the bread to be served with duck pate that is served at the bistro in Holland V..

Pity about the service

Excellent food. The set lunch is real value for money at SGD30++. Grab an outdoor seat on a cool day and enjoy :)

Fantastic!

Tried the exec lunch, value for money and good food, However, the baguette spoiled it, its not hand make, not acceptable for a fine french bistro, otherwise it will get four stars!

The food here is inconsistent. On occasion, all the courses served have been of an extremely high standard and other times the food has been oversalted, especially their accompanying lentils and the occasional duck confit. Their set lunch at $30++ is such good value for money though
