This is the best Indian Chinese have had in Singapore. The food was excellent, matched by their fantastic service. The Chinese Bhel was exceptional, as was the Rasgulla. We will be back!

Average food... not worth of time to invest on review.
For sure, not going again...
Better to avoid.. as nearby lot of options available..

Superb food! The momos are truly delicious. Across the board, soups, mains, noodles/rice and desserts, the food quality is great. If you like spicy they can do spicy!! Service is prompt and friendly- although I'm not a fan of ordering via an iPad.

We were up for an adventure and Fifth Season certainly delivered, what a different style of cooking Indian-Chinese (with a touch of Tibet) is! The Mongolian potato and Coriander Paneer were amazing but frankly it all was. Service was a bit strange at first when the waiter couldn't understand the concept of tap water, but the head waiter found us eventually and he was good.

I have never heard of or tried Indian Chinese food before till I went to Fifth Season with a friend. Indian Chinese cuisine is actually a particular style of cooking.Fifth season offers a descent range of vegetarian choices which is nice. The cooking style is indeed quite special and I do find it very refreshing. It uses a lot of South Asian herbs and spices.One vegetarian set lunch is priced between 15-20 SGD which is a bit on the high side

Do not order food from this place via Uber Eats or any other delivery .They will conveniently forget your order. When you call them up for the missing item they tell you that they will 'attempt' to send it. No promises. And guess what? They have already charge your credit card for it. And our missing order never came. So in short, this is one untrustworthy restaurant in Singapore. Order at own risk if you fancy feeling cheated!

I took a friend from China to try Indian Chinese food. We ordered a chilli chicken and prawns with hot garlic sauce. The food was tasteless. We're had to send the chicken back as it was not cooked well. Both the dishes didn't seem to have much flavour to it. I am still trying to figure out what was served. The food was much better 6 month ago. I don't think it was worth the money I spent on this meal.
3
Finally decided to give this Indian-Chinese-Tibetan restaurant a try. Had their lunch special. While the momos (we had the pan-fried version) were good, the rest of the food was average. Expected better taste in Chicken Manchurian, e.g. The curry in the chicken dish was so-so, as was the vegetarian fried rice.Finally, the lunch was promoted as half-price ($16.50 after discount). I would be really surprised if anyone would pay full price ($33) for this lunch, for the location and the food served. So basically the half-price promotion is a sham
4
If you have ever tasted Chinese food in Kolkata you would definitely love these food here, provided you need to have TASTE buds. Surprising taste of Kolkata-like Chinese food in Singapore.
5
This place gives you a great fusion of Indian and Chinese food so one can enjoy many recipes having right taste and enjoy the with family and friends

Good Indianised Chinese food for Indian palette. Each dish ranges from 13-17 SGD, with well sized portions. Service with a smile!
3
The 2 main dishes we ordered arrived 10 minutes apart. Very ordinary Chinese-Indian. I would not eat here again.
1
Came here taking my family thinking a good Chinese food will be served. But this place is hopeless. We were made to wait for 15 mins without anyone attending. We had to make ourselves visible and walk to all the staff requesting a table but no one bothered to attend. Finally, after making some noise one of the waiter walked towards us and said he needs to find us a place and it will take 10 mins. With elderly people in our group this resto made us wait 20 mins to get a table even when it wasn't crowded. I am amazed this kind of service given by the restaurant in Singapore. Not recommended if you are traveling with elderly people.

We went to Fifth season this week for lunch.We had Chinese Bhel, Gobi Manchurian with Gravy, Sch. Fried Rice and Malpua in dessert.Chinese Bhel was good. Fried rice was up to the mark - must mention portion size was good for two people. Gravy of Gobi Manchurian was good but the balls were not so good. They lacked flavors and it wasn't that good. Spring Onion play a big part in Gobi Manchurian gravy and it was missing. Malpua was also disappointing.Portion side - Good for two people.Service - very quick. Found it a bit pricey.There are other options available were you get better Indian-Chinese

First of all, I would like everyone to know that I've travelled to over 20 countries. My father says that you should eat to live, but tells me that I live to eat. I'm British but I've lived in Beijing & I currently live in Taiwan. Therefore, I am familiar with dumplings of all kinds as I have traveled a lot through Asia. I read a review on this restaurant and after dining here it exceeded my expectations. I ended up going here for my last two nights in Singapore.The mixed chicken momos are some of the best dumplings I've had. The steamed momos are fresh, while the pan fried are packed full of flavour. The pan fried momos are the better choice though. It just depends if you want freshness or flavour.The Tibetan Thukpa Vegetable soup is a little spicy and an excellent choice too. The other three dishes I tried were the Red Chill Prawns, Prawn Kasundi (pickled mustard) and the Coriander Chilli Chicken. All were excellent, but the coriander chilli chicken is the pick of the bunch. For desert, I tried Mishti Doi (steamed yoghurt pudding) and Rossomalai. Both were excellent choices. Some Indian deserts are too sweet for my palate, but these were both perfectly balanced. I tried the Mishti Doi both visits, and I had the same result both times, perfection. The staff were very friendly and on the second visit we talked about food and provinces in India after our meal. One of the waiters recommended places to visit based on the fondness of our favourite Indian cuisine, and educated us on Indian deserts. I couldn't speak more highly of my overall experience.The price is great, as I feel that it is real value for money. I've paid more for food in other countries that doesn't even compare to the quality of this restaurant. My partner and I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that visits Singapore

There are limited number of places that offer Indian Chinese in Singapore ( Chinese dishes adapted to Indian taste and uniquely Indian in nature) and Fifth season happens to be one of them, We went there because we were really craving for this type of cuisine. Sad to say, the food was of such poor quality that it ensured we don't have any such craving for the next few months ! The noodles were not soft, the fried dishes had too much oil and the chicken was surely a few days old. Plus we had to cancel one rice dish as they hadn't served it till the time we left the restaurant

Stumbled onto this restaurant at the end of the visit in Little India. What a hidden treasure. The entire menu is on an iPad. You simple find what you want to eat and drink add to your shopping cart, confirm the order, and wait for a fresh and totally delicious meal to be brought to your table. THE FOOD IS AMAZING! The waitstaff was customer friendly and extremely nice. The place was pretty packed and there were a lot of to go orders being picked up. Will certainly go back
4
Located at 2 mins walk from the Little India MRT station, this place offers nice Indo Chinese options.We Indians love the fusion of Chinese food and this place serves those usual delicacies that we relish back home.Right from hot Manchow soup to Hakka noddles, they serve it all.My favourites============Momos (Steamed/ Pan Fried Chili Garlic)Chicken Lollipop Chicken CorianderChow Chow RiceNote# Lot of options for vegetarians as well. Paneer, Mushrooms, Baby Corns, Stir fried vegetables, Mock meat etcI've seen local Singaporeans enjoying the food as well along with the usual suspects (Indians)So if you want to enjoy Chinese food with a twist, do visit this place
2
The food quality is quite bad. We ordered the set lunch and all the dishes apart from the momos were tasteless and not cooked upto the mark.
Amongst the worst Indian Chinese i have had in Singapore.
5
The food is great, the best in Singapore as far as indian Chinese is concerned. The prices are moderate and the service is 5 star. The food they serve is super tasty and worth trying.
5
Love love love the food here ! It's delicious with all the right flavors . One of the best places in Singapore for Indian- Chinese cuisine . Loved the momos!
4
If you like Indo-Chinese food,this is the place to be. A bit on the expensive side but the food is totally worth it. Do try chicken chilli and hakka noodles.
4
We had been this restaurant a number of times. Had dinner with parents and children. Ordered vegetarian food. 1. Starter: Ordered pan fried veg momos. There were just excellent. Highly recommended. 2. Tried Chow Chow Rice. It was good. 3. Veg Machurian: It was decent and bit salty. 4. Ambience: Quite good. 5. Price: A bit pricey though. Food is excellent and recommend who wants try something new and different.
3
Looking to relive the good momos we had in. Nepalese restaurant in HongKong. All review points to this restaurant and we're not disappointed. It was full on a Saturday night but the staff quickly got us a table. Due to poor acoustics, it was very noisy. We could hardly hear ourselves and the rest were trying to out do each other. The iPad ordering system was very effective. The rest of the food taste more like American Chinese takeout, if you're looking for chow fan or main (fried rice or noodles).

Fifth Season's co-owner Joy and I have been colleagues and friends for almost two decades. We loved trying out different cuisines and restaurants, and used to joke that we would start our own someday. Well, Joy went ahead and did it and opened Fifth Season around 10 years back.The cuisine here is unique - it is authentic to Joy's hometown in the province of West Bengal in India, where a resident population of Chinese immigrants customized their cuisine to the local tastes. It is a centuries old fusion of Indian and Chinese foods, honed to perfection over time - extraordinarily flavorful, bright and at times even intoxicating!Fifth Season has only become better over time, contrary to most other restaurants I have been going to over the years. The reason for this is that Joy and his partner are perfectionists in every sense of the word. They continue to tinker with, fine tune and add to their sauces - the heart and soul of the flavor in their dishes. The noodles have evolved over time - they are now prepared fresh daily locally, customized for the right consistency, thickness and fast specifically for the dishes here. (Most restaurants get dry packaged noodles that they cook.) The deserts (including the complex ones) are prepared from scratch in the restaurant instead of sourcing pre-made from a specialty vendor. You must try the Rasamalai - I had it just last week it is the best I have ever had, period.My favorite dishes are the Chinese Bhel, the taipei cauliflower, and the chili coriander potatoes. The potatoes in the latter are brilliant - crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, almost like a gnocchi! The momos are a must - I prefer the steamed version, but they have plenty of customizations to try out.No trip to Singapore for me is complete without at least a couple of trips to Fifth Season. We just came back from one, and we really enjoyed all the different vegetarian cuisines the island had to offer - japanese, korean, taiwanese, indonesian, local. And my son put it simply on our last night before we left - "Dad, Fifth Season is my favorite. Can we please order from them tonight?
5
Tangra Chinese originates from the only China town in India - Kolkata. The taste is atypical and a heady mix of Hakka Chinese cuisine and Indian spices/ingredients. The food at Fifth Season does not disappoint and we have gone back countless number of times to enjoy it. Our favourites are the pan fried momos, the fried rice, chilli chicken and manchurian chicken. Hope the restaurant maintains this quality in the times to come
4
"Indian Chinese" flavour in place like Singapore is uniqueness of this restaurant. For those with taste buds of indian chinese don't really relish perfect chinese dishes..and this place offers perfect solution to linger their taste buds in a very authentic and unique India taste way. Must recommended for those craving of Indian chinese in Singapor
3
Though a meal would set you back by SGD 100 to SGD 150 it's generally tasty. The ambience is strictly okay. There is an option to sit down or climb upstairs. It's worth sampling the chicken momos, chilly chicken dry and also the chicken fried rice. The spicy prawns are also succulent.There is an option for takeaway and there is also home delivery through third party delivery providers. It helps to call ahead for reservations especially on weekends.
2
The food tasted amazing but there was one problem, 1 of my food was under cooking and another one had to much of salt. Otherwise every was good. Second problem was it was a little to expensive.
4
The restaurant isnt so big, so would suggest making reservations in advance.
The food is nice, given that I havent found any good Indo-chinese places in Singapore.
4
Went with my friends and had one of the best Indian Chinese food in Singapore. Highly recommend this place. We tried a variety of dishes and all were very tasty.
5
Our taste buds were missing the Chinese food that we grew up eating in Tangra, Kolkata, therefore, when we came across this place, we had to try it. We were not disappointed. The food was mouth-watering and took us back to the City of Joy... the service was good and so was the ambiance. We were satisfied customers and would visit again..
4
interesting mix of flavor between Indian and Chinese. Spicy momos were excellent. chili paneer also a mix of Indian paneer with chili\onion sauce (one chicken dish Kai Lai or something was OK). reasonable price, prompt service.a good experience
1
Absolute crap food, the momos are stale not even warm. They are the first restaurant on the entire Race Course Road to not serve tap water and charge exorbitant for bottled wate
5
If you are a Bengali in Singapore missing the "Chinese" tastes and dishes that you grew up with or a food explorer who wants to taste how Indians "indianize" anything and everything ... Fifth Season Tangra Chinese is a must-visit place. What I loved most is the authenticity that they retained in their dishes. With the broad range and different spice levels of food, you are sure to find get to the dishes that will make you want to come back
3
I liked the hakka noodles served here. My wife loved the prawn appetizer. The soups were just ok. Dont think would visit the place any time soon
4
One evening we developed a craving for momo's. Found this place on search, I ll admit the momo's are good and worth the visit. The noddles were very average or may be it was the last order when we did at 10.30 pm ... I would recommend to try .
5
Love this place for Momo's, American Chopsuey, Gobi Manchurian, Hakka Noodles. Very happy that we have such a place in Singapore.It is very rare to find a place serving American Chopsuey as its one of my favourites dishes from childhood. Great place to try the service is excellent and food is relatively cheap compared to other outlets in Race course roadIf you like Indian Chinese this is the place to g
4
Decent indian chinese food. The pan-fried momos esp are very good and I frequent the restaurant just for this dish
5
Lovely food here with quick delivery. Being vegetarian, had gobi manchurian gravy with fried rice and hakka noodles. Too good.....
5
Wow! Delightful FOOD! Indian Chinese Speciality. The Momos are amazing, the pan fried chicken one especially.
4
Very good food, clean place and worth coming for Tangra cuisine/ Indian chinese cuisine definitely recommend for trying!! Enjoy
3
Chinese Bhel, Pan Fried Momos and a host of other unique dishes make Fifth Season stand out from your typical restaurant serving Indo-Chinese food. Few things to note at the outset - Fifth Season only serves Indo-Chinese and its variants like Tibetan cuisine. The taste may not conform to the typical Indo-Chinese served back in India. but hey, what is authentic Indo-Chinese cuisine? I am debating between giving an Average and Very Good for Fifth Season and will probably settle for a 3.5. I've had some very good meals there, but some have been disappointing. I especially like their pan fried momos which is pretty unique and highly recommended. It is also very accessible from the Little India MRT. I've found the price to be on the higher side, compared to other restaurants in the Little India area and frankly the place does not command a premium in my opinion.If you are looking for Indo-Chinese cuisine with a twist and a place with decent ambiance, Fifth Season is a good option
4
My partner and I ate in fifth season and were pleasantly surprised. It's fairly cheap by Singapore standards and there are a large variety of Chinese, Mongolian, Indian and Tibetan foods available. We had the momos, chilli paneer and mongolian potatoes. You order via an ipad and the food comes fairly quickly so it's slightly impersonal and has a fast-food approach but I thoroughly enjoyed the food and would eat here again
2
It was super crowded due to the Durga Puja celebrations... But no excuse for the poor quality of food. The momos and the prawns tasted of flour; food tasted like too much of baking powder was added to thicken the gravy... gave me a stomach burn the nexst day. Good service by the waiters though managing a large crowd
5
This is the best restaurant in Singapore to serve Indian style Chinese food which means noodles and rice cooked in sauces but with Indian spices. This is a very yummy combination and right from Chinese Bhel to Pan fried Chicken momos to schezwan fried rice and all time favorite hakka noodles.. you feel like devouring them all. Those who have never tried this combination but enjoy Indian food, this is a must go place
3
One of the few restaurants serving indian Chinese food. Food is good, especially the Chinese bhel and manchurian, though a tad oily. The restaurant is pricey for Little India location, expect to pay at least 20 dollars per person. The hotel staff are polite. The order taking is through iPad device, however, the staff did not explain how the order is to be confirmed. So we ended waiting for the food for an extra 30 minutes
4
I came here for the first time and it was absolutely great. The place was clean and cool. The food here is served in great quantity as well as good quality. The food arrived in less than 20 mins and it was an excellent way to fill my stomach
5
Me and my bong friend wanted to have some Kolkata chinese and here were at Tangra! Wonder food and ambiance!
Would be going back time and again!
Must visit place in Singapore!
4
i have been here just once but the experience was amazing as i enjoyed a lot and the food is amazing with new varieties and a lot of fun with friends and family.
4
If one is looking for Indo-chinese food in Singapore, this is the place to be! Quite good variety, but might burn a hole in your pocket. Loved the chilli chicken here, must recommended!
5
I went to this restaurant on 1st week of September. This is my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I love food. the tastes is really gud. my favorite dish is momos. And Chinese bhel. Its awesome.
3
First experience with momo's (simular to dumplings). And it was quiet good! The filling is more rich in flavor and they come in baked and steamed version. We had mixed platter veggie and a chicken momo as starters (3 friends, 5/6 momo's pp) and each a main course with rice after that... Way too much, just share everything or order less. The veggie platter came 10 min after the chicken which was annoying but that seems to be normal here in Singapore.Momo's and the main courses are Indian/Chinees/Tibet mixture of flavours, so hard to describe and new to me. Definitely happy I tried it. This seemed a good place to go because they have a lot of choice (veg and non-veg).Situated in Little India, the place looks clean (in terms of hygiene and interior). Not the most cosy place ever. Menu = ipad, which was a nice touch. You have to send your orders via an application (one 1/table but you can easily ask more ipads to look into the menu).We paid $100 for 3 people, we shared 2 starters, each had main course, shared the rice and shared 2 bottles of water. So I thought that was way too much, even for Singapore (especially given the type of food and it is not in a fancy area)!! But who knows these are normal prices for eating momo's...Conclusion: happy that I tried momo's, good food but too expensive for me..
3
We were just wandering looking for somewhere to eat & the guy out front attracted us to try this place. Orders are placed on an ipad - a quirky touch. Food was good, but pricey for what we had. There was a small bottle of water on each table - at room temperature and the seal on the cap was broken. (Obviously just refilled from the tap.) We chose not to use the water and had a couple of beers instead. So we were surprised when we received our bill to pay not only tax & a service charge imposed - but $1 for the water! Charge was removed from our bill when we commented. Nice food, efficient service, a nice change of cuisine for Little India - but pricey for what we had
4
Kolkata has a special flavor to its Chinese cuisine which is very different from the original Chinese food. Though there are over thousands of restaurants and hotels and fine dinings all over Singapore but its a rare place where you can get Kolkata Chinese... and indeed this is the place where you can satisfy your gastronomic desires.The owner of the restaurant really feed you with the care as if you are her private guest.The rest of the staff are also very cordial and helpful.People who are not tech that savy might get a shock as you are encouraged to order by an IPad, but if you cant make it,, they indeed help you.We(2 person) paid a bill of about S$42 for a soup and 2 main course food but sat there for almost 2hrs.. no one came to give us any hint!! you know what I mean!
2
Visited this place after many years, but disappointed is a very small word when I am thinking of my experience here. Won a 30$ voucher for this restaurant after winning in some radio show. The moment we entered this place we could feel the lack of hospitality. A bottle of water on the table, a guy randomly came and put an iPad on the table ,leaving us clueless what to do with it. On asking he said,we can only redeem 20$ and need to come again for another 10. Found it very strange; why did u even sponsor 30,if u won't redeem all. anyway, we went ahead with the order. Gobbled the food -manchurian (with very little gravy) noodles and soup. Asked for water and was told that need to pay for it. Indian restaurant and no water being served..later the waiter said that they are doing all that to save manpower. Singapore govt is insisting on having iPads for menu card and bottled water . I was shocked to hear that because all the Singapore restaurant we go to, still serve water . May be they still believe in " atithi devo bhava ( guest is like god) well after paying $42.00 for a bowl of soup, a plate of noodles and manchurian we walked out...disappointed, angry and shocked !
4
Real Indian Chinese food. Tastes just like we had in india. Thumbs up to everything we had so far... Hot and sour soup, sweet corn soup, momos, chili chicken, hot garlic fish, american chopsuey...and more... No complaints for food. Only thing.. its bit pricey. I would definitely recommend fifth season for all those craving for indo chinese food
4
Went here for lunch. You must try the spicy chicken momos. Give the red chilly prawns a miss. The chilly fish is a different taste but the hakka noodles were nice. Enjoyed the tibetean spicy mince meat soup with noodles. Ordered the deep fried ice cream but the batter was a bit too thick for my liking. Very freindly and knowledgable staff. Worth a visit, ambiance nothing to write home about
4
This is the place if you had a lot of craving for Indian kind of chinese food...it will satisfy your soul.This places provides the best fusion of Indian, chinese and tibetian flavour...Average cost of dining will be around 20 S $ per person
4
More seating space required !!
Small, cosy & nice.
Nice Indian Chinese ; portion of food also ok.
Service should improve.
More-or-less ok on value for money.
5
Great chilly chicken, Manchurian and fried rice. Best are its momos but a but expensive. Good food and attentive staff.
We visit this place once in a month or so and love the food there.
2
We have been regulars at fifth season for a few years - mainly for their momos and Gobi Manchurian. The price has crept up steadily over the years without a noticeable change in the service/ambience/overall offering. For a vegetarian meal without alcohol, we typically end up spending SGD 40 per person.One aspect which forces me to give them two stars instead of three is their policy of not serving two water even on request. Singapore tap water is perfectly drinkable. But I was told management had decided only bottled water could be had - due to hygiene reasons. (I assume the wait staff was mapping the last part up)If you love Indian Chinese food ( Eg. Chinese Mirch in Manhattan till recently) , you will like this place
3
I'd heard a lot about Fifth Season and finally decided to try it. They state right upfront on their board that their brand of Indian Chinese cuisine is Tangda (more from the Eastern part of India).The restaurant is located on Racecourse Road and at times you can be lucky enough to get parking right outside.Its a small restaurant and the decor is very basic. The service though is very attentive and knowledgeable.We tried the Chinese bhel for starters and it was unusual but very tasty. We also tried the Chicken Lollypop and found it to be average if a bit spicy.For the main course we tried the Kung Pao chicken, Chicken Hakka noodles and an Egg Fried Rice. While all the dishes were palatable, none of them really hit the spot.For dessert, we went non traditional and had the fried icecream. We ended up leaving most of it.Indian Chinese is a unique and very personal taste. While many swear by Fifth Season, I personally found it lacking
4
I took my Swedish friend along to make her try Indian Chinese and the food and service turned out to be really good. She loves spicy and I had told her that Indian chinese is like no other cuisine and she got that when we received our order. I asked for extra spicy and we both love spicy food and we were not disappointed. They use iPads to take orders now and the service is very swift. Only downside they have increased the prices quite a bit. I hope they work on that. The portions are fairly large and filling. I would love to go back and take some of my international friends. They have a good scheme where if you give feedback and become a member you get 10% off on the next visit. Jolly good!
3
The food tasted like Indian Chinese, the way I expected it to. Portions were a decent size too. But I found it a tad expensive for what you get. Just two plates of rice, one meat dish, one veg side, soft drinks and dessert cost 100 bucks. The gulab jamun (dessert) I ordered was unfortunately made from a pre mix powder. That was a big disappointment.
5
5th Season is a great restaurant – its small but has more seating in an upstairs area. It can get noisy but not unbearable. The service is good but can get slow when the restaurant gets busy. However any inadequacy gets balanced by the yummilicious food! Top on my list is the spicy pan-fried chicken momos – they are delicious and the sauce served with it adds to the burst of flavours. My other favourites are crispy baby corn and salt and pepper prawn. The restaurant has raised prices over the years and you can expect to spend around $30-40 person without alcohol
4
Ambience wise not great but its good.. Good service and also lot of options for veggies:).. We ordered something called chinese bhel its a crisp noodles with bhel masala..it was good. We also ordered pan fried veg momos, even tat was tasty. I suggest that one must try this restaurant:).
4
we used to pass this small fine dine restaurant just next to little India mrt at 28 race course roada nicely done indian chinese Tangra Restaurant ,never knew Tangra until this week we saw a multi course family & group dining offer for just 15.50$..this was something that pulled us in.well the restaurant is small and little noisy at downstairs..the guy suggested us to take seat upstairs which is quiter. Indeed its nicely done cozy restaurantwe started with soupCourse 1 : In Soup we choose1. Spicy Chicken Thukpa Soup was really nice and it really kept our expectations very high for our next dishCourse 2 : in Starter ,we choose 1. Pan Fried Tibetan Chicken Momos2. Chinese Bhelby this time we realised we have discovered a great place probably the most unique indian chinese food in Singapore. Momo's or Dumplings were a wow and the sauce made it tasted really good.little spicy and tangyChinese bhel was something very very unique never even imagined a dish like this can be made out of noodles and sauces.we were almost full by now and asked them to reduce the quantity of main course :)now it was main course we selected 1. Chow Chow Rice Veg2. Veg Manchurian Gravy3. Chili Chicken Gravychow chow rice was a first for us its a mix of noodles and rice very unique ..veg manchurian was very soft and rich in vege ..kids really enjoyed them a lot as it was medium spiced and very tastyChilli Chicken was really hot with lots of green chillis and spicy sauce was really nice and went on very well with my whisky.finally it was desert time we selected 1. House Special Darsaan with Ice Creamagain a different Indian sweet dish with ice cream and kids enjoyed this the most after spicy treatall in all it was a wow experience and the deal was worth exploring and an evening well spendexcept for the little nose and if they improve the service time i think every thing was just perfect
