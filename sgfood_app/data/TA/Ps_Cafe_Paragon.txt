Food was great, service was good too. If I would choose a thing to pick on, is maybe the restaurant is pretty small and easily pack with customers.

Had lunch here with the family... we ordered the caesar salad ü•ó, roast chicken and PS steak sandwiches ü•™ and king prawn aglo olio üç§. The food was great and we enjoyed lunch, but with a few drinks, it put us back nearly $200! üôÑ
5
Love this place and have been coming here for a few years running when I visit Singapore. My favourite is the roast chicken sandwich which truffle fries, highly recommended!
5
The food is always great at PS Cafe Paragon (the best branch by far) and the ambience is also very good! Toni is such an efficient member of the team and is extremely friendly :) Thank you!
4
We came before the lunch crowd for a meeting. Had a fresh juice and a Lynchee soda, and they we kind enough to also offer a glass of warm water. Overall a friendly crew and good ambience for a quite discussion.
4
Whenever we have a little time to spare we will get to Orchard Road and enjoy a break at PS Caf√©. Selection of drinks and food is good. Particularly love the cakes and PS Caf√© Signature Sandwich with Turkey Breast, Cheese and Cranberry jam.Service its very good, Tony and it's crew always swirling around to make customer feel homey and feel welcome. Great job guys, not often you can find it.Sometimes you have to wait though as its very popular among locals and tourists

I do not usually walk out of a restaurant before dining. This time the experience was so bad that ee walked out even before I started ordering our food. We know the outlet is busy and there is a queue but customers should be treated decently. We were given a tiny table for 2 and I had to sit so vlise to the menu board. after I sat down nobody would be able to see whats the daily special as I was blocking the view. We asked for a table change and this young obviously in experienced staff gestured us reluctantly to another equally bad seating. We decided to walk out as we know our dinner will not be a pleasant one. Hate to say this but if the managers/owners do not do something about their service staff's attitude, they wont have many repeat customer
3
You would expect the price to be higher than it rightly should be.You would expect the coffee to be average, but served in a huge cup.You would expect the clientele to be white, even when Asian.You would expect the atmosphere to be generic.You would expect the service to be decent.And you know, your expectations will be met. No exceeded, but met.Would you expect a coffee and juice to cost over $20 (after taxes)? I wouldn't. So P.S. Cafe can go bankrupt for all I care. The world does not need places like this

On Thursday October 26, after a very pleasant lunch, we headed specially to PS cafe at Paragon for dessert.When we got there, there was no queue and upon looking into the modest-sized cafe, we noticed there were a few empty tables and a few more which were being prepped for the next wave of people.We stood and waited at the entrance of the cafe for quite a few minutes but even though there seemed to be a good ratio of staff in relation to the size of the cafe and the fact that it was past lunch and it was a "lull period", we were simply left standing there.The surprising thing was that not one single staff member looked in the direction of the entrance where a sign with "Please wait to be seated" was placed.After a bit, my Friend and I stepped away from the entrance to see if we could perhaps catch the eye of at least one staff member. But no.Then we dutifully went back towards where the Sign was placed. After a couple more minutes, one of the staff decided to come towards us.There was no greeting, no smile.We casually and politely mentioned that we had been standing there for a while and that we were Glad to get a table as we were tired.The retort was shockingly rude and caught us off-guard."You think we are not tired?"I decided to let that remark go because I didn't want to mar our outing.I have been to this particular branch of PS countless number of times over the years because Paragon is where I shop, eat and generally "hang out".PS is not, and never has been, a Favourite of mine because it's cramped with too many tables in too close quarters, with uncomfortable seats and rather over-priced food.Thursday, 26 October, was our "lucky day"First the disgruntled staff member, then our dry chocolate cake, which even that scoop of ice cream couldn't "revive

My daughter was the one who brought me to ps cafe at Palais renaissance few years ago , another time to the outlet at Dempsey and recently to the outlet at Paragon together with my Husband. This time she recommended the pesto Laksa spaghetti and the fish and chips . She also ordered our favourite truffle mushroom soup and the chocolate blackout cake which is my favourite . We loved both items she recommended . I particularly love the chocolate blackout cake and immediately send via WhatsApp to my colleague and wow she went to try on the very day itself whilst my sister in law went with her Sister to try on another day too . I also recommended friends to try the pesto laksa spaghetti and the fish and chips . Food portion was huge and yummy . Buying take away was also a Breeze and much faster . Will definitely patronise the cafe again and recommend to friends and relatives for the good food and friendly service
5
My local friends took me here for lunch, they are regulars. I loved the ambience, and the food.
Overall it was very good and worth it.
4
We are having truffle fries, crispy skin red snapper, chick Salad, and patay salad.
Best one is the patay salad with additional dressing...bit sour n fresh.
One more great thing is the drinking water is provided complimentary.
3
The place looks amazing. Very good decorating are in there but unfortunately that's not reflected in the food. We didn't enjoy our meal which was from different selection from their menu which reflects that their chef is not as strong as the place looks like!
4
Very good atmosphere and selection of food. One of the few places I came across that serves salads. Fresh ingredients.
4
Friendly service, chill out environment with well spaced out tables and wholesome food. Always a pleasant experience dining here.
4
Went for a work related catch up at lunch hour. Good neat place. Had the veggie Moroccan stack. Good. Will visit again
3
Best fish and chips, but really need to work out with their service. Peak hour from7pm and if you had a chance to talk to a waiter please all ask what you need coz maybe this is the last time you will talk to a waiter, next is the bill.
5
When looking for a great lunch option while shopping at Orchard, a visit to PS Cafe in Paragon Mall is a must. Only caveat is that you must have adequate time on hand as the service is slow and at times there can be waiting time for a table at this very popular cafe.For vegetarians they have an option in soup, salad, pasta and burger in addition to drinks, desserts and sides so I'd say the menu is decent enough. We ordered their pasta and burger and the portions were generous. Also recommend their smoothie and desserts (if you have any room left to eat!).Only downside is service (and probably the cooking) can be somewhat slow so this one's for those looking for a leisurely meal in no hurry
4
Reservations is definitely required during weekends, we couldn't get a table for dinner so came back for the deserts instead. Sticky date pudding - portion was just nice, a large dollop of vanilla ice cream (perhaps too much) over the warm comforting pudding. Pudding tasted soft and moist, really sweet with the generous toffee caramel sauce. Sundaes - both were specials for the day, each sundae was served with 3 large scoop of ice-cream. The lychee flavor taste really refreshing and light, rocky road flavor however does not taste very special.Key lime pie - tangy and sourness was just nice with the kick but not overpowering. Crust however was too thick at the side edges, hard to even break it. Whipped cream was smooth and freshly whipped. Double chocolate cake - really too huge! Frosting was rather thick and hard, we ordered for the ice cream to be served separately. Cake was rich and very chocolatey, yummy however definitely a must share.5 desserts with 2 drink (matcha latte and cappuccino), bill sums up to a shocking $100+! Extremely pricey for just desserts, large portion for sure and delicious but really a extravagant treat
4
We popped in for desserts after having dinner at Imperial Treasure. They have lovely cakes, which are of a generous portion. We ordered the double chocolate and the carrot cake. The chocolate cake was very good, and I liked it even though I am not a huge chocolate fan. The carrot cake was dry, though, and I still prefer the one by Cedele.Their drinks me u was quite interesting too, with cute names. I had something that was lychee based and while refreshing, it was ordinary.We were a group of six and they tried to seat us at a table for four, even though there was a large kind of enclosed library area jut off the front door. In the end, after some persuasion, we managed to get seats at the communal table there
1
I ordered their pad thai salad and it had peanuts that were rock hard, noodles that had the consistency of plastic, and not enough sauce in it.
5
If you are a 'lady what lunches' or just a tourist come to this stylish and delicious cafe/bar/gin palace for a slice of old colonial charm. Centrally located dining here feels like being transported in time. With lovely black and white colonial decor, Western European and local cafe favourites and a calm and lovely feel this place is fantastic. Let the friendly staff pamper you and make suggestions and don't forget the gin!!
4
Hidden amongst luxury shops of the paragon mall, Ps. Cafe is a perfect place for a lunch or dinner break. Such a laid back and cozy ambience, featuring walls full of wine bottles and dim lighting. We came in quite late almost 30 minutes before closing. There were much less people than usual, which is also added some romantic vibe to it. Their superfood salad featured quinoa, sunflower seeds, spinach and light dressing was simply amazing, while japanese fusion salad was extraordinary! The truffle fries were delicious and the portion was very generous. Loved their healthy juice mixes too. Since we came in quite late, the waiters were focusing more on shutting down the restaurant than serving their customers. We wish they were a bit more attentive to this. But this minor thing didn't disappoint us too much and we would still come back for more truffle fries.
5
It's my first time here but I totally fall in love with this cafe!!! Super nice coffee and dessert!!!! They have a variety of menus for you to choose both proper meal and dessert. And they all are so nice. Services are very good and price is reasonable. Go there and you will know why it's my fav!
5
Entrance is wow, classic, contemporary & sophisticated and all the magazines are waiting for you to read! From Monocle to ... you will not get bored! Interior simply classy & cosy at the same time. For a moment you are completely lost and have to remind yourself that you are in beautiful Singapore - and not in NY or London. Food amazing! Atmosphere speechless and staff, well this is Asia, maybe a little bit too serious and too focused? Definitely must to eat place and make sure to bring all your girls, will be more fun!
3
We had the Big Breakfast and truffle fries, both did not live much of an impression. The toast of the Big Breakfast was hard and cold and the sausage was slightly below average. The meal didn't deserve the 30 min or so waiting in the queue.It might be that we had visited the place on a Sat, during lunch hour, so the place was packed and not conducive for conversations. Service however was quite good with friendly staff
4
My favorite dish is their Fish and Chips, only not much greetings and farewell from the staff , Its better if they say thank you to all the customer leaving the cafe. Nice place and good food. We wanted to ask for more ice water but yeah all the staff were busy too and all behind.Its good when someone looking after the guest need in the main area.But overall all good! We will come back for sure
4
I'd read a newspaper article that recommended a stop here for the key lime pie. We had a table outside and as it was Good Friday this was perfect for people watching. They seemed very busy taking reservations and calling people when their table was ready.  Coffee was pronounced very good, and the key lime pie lived up to the recommendation. Very tart but balanced out by the biscuit base and generous serving of fresh cream. Great place for afternoon tea though next time must try the truffle chips whose smell wafted up to use from a neighbouring table
4
Excellent location, comfortable and convivial ambience, excellent service and cooking and presenting truly great hamburgers....that for me is fine dining, not fast food. A very tasty patty, flavoured in a way that you get to taste the meat, toppings with caramelised onions to the fire and a bun that does not fall apart and tastes like freshly baked whole wheat bread......with potato frys to kill for....and all with just a touch of salt and very little oil! Overall a winner of a meal. Looking for a hearty, tasty meal.....head for Paragon on Orchard and to Ps. Cafe. Highly recommended
5
Eight of us went to dinner on a Thursday evening. The truffle fries were delicious. Beef pie was OK. I was a bit disappointed I ordered it once I saw the Moroccan Stack my friend had. He said it was delicious. Service was attentive, atmosphere was upscale casual and the wine and dessert menus were decent
4
We love going to this branch of PS cafe. The staff are very friendly and accommodating and the food is delicious. The salads are great, but beware the desserts are enormous!
5
Firstly, i don't normally like truffle oil.. like the ones they put on the creamy soup as the smell is too strong. So, when my friends ordered truffle fries, I was unsure. After trying one bite, i'm sold! It was soooooo good. It really really really is a must have. The mains we ordered weren't that special - fish and chips and pasta. However, for dessert, we ordered the profiteroles which was filled with ice cream - that was a nice ending to a great meal. With two appetisers, two mains and one dessert with drinks for three person, the bill was SGD 65 per pax.Service was honestly ok - I had no issue, though I noticed some people had
1
I went to PS Cafe last weekend for a meal on my own. After being seated and given a menu no one returned to take my order. They weren't full and staff didn't seem run off their feet. Infant they were joking around near the kitchen area. After I waited for 20 minutes, I got up and went to the front counter and told the guy I had been waiting for a long time. There was NO apology but he quite rudely told me that he would send someone to me. The server was also quite rude and offered no apology after I also told her that I had been waiting for a long time. The food was just ok, quite expensive for the small portion. I won't be going back and there are plenty of far better options in Singapore and at the Paragon/Orchard area. I encourage you to go elsewhere
4
PS Caf√© at the Paragon was a place my wife and I came across by chance; however it was the right decision to eat there. Well positioned within the Paragon shopping complex, the food quality and quantity is excellent and the menu has a good cross-section of dishes as you would find in most international standard menus, complimented with a very good wine and spirits selection. Simply a great place to eat, drink and socialize, the service is first class and the food of a very high standard. All made even the better by Toni, who could not do enough for us
4
We had dinner at Martin Rd outlet, it's quite a huge restaurant , the ambience and vibe is more relaxed. We had the burger and prawn pasta , which were great and came in good portions.This place is located just outside the CBD area , lots of families and they offer a local menu featuring nasi goreng , lobster laksa which makes up an interesting menu
3
The place is good to hang out with friends or with your beloved one. My first impression was the staffs were friendly and nice, but the service is just decent, I need to ask 3 times for my bill. The portion is just enough for me, though my friend said it was quite big
4
If you want a place with an easy cafe food to hang out with friends or easy business lunch with affordable price, this is the place. Service is very casual. You might have to waive your hand a few time before your water is refilled, but it's in a mall. So don't expect super fine service:
4
Yes We looking for PS cafe, my friend said food is good.We arrive there, first impression is nice greetings I Love it...Do not to wait long to get a table for 4 of Us, food also come with the right time.I'm so impressed to see all the staff work and fast moving, quick response, friendly also, good ambience there.We have YUMMY burger, pasta, but I forgot the name. Coffee also fine. The portion of the food quite big, if you kind of person not to eat many better to share hahaha...On that time actually i'm interest to order the french fries with grated cheese on top, I saw in other table but sorry my tummy can't accept other food
5
This is my go to cafe in Singapore when I don't want to do Asian food. Even though it was some Asian dishes, the Ps chain really understands the western taste buds. Lots of fresh crispy salads, burgers, pasta plus specials on a blackboard really caters for all tastebuds. Ice teas, juices and alcohol beverages plus gorgeous homemade cakes. Carrot and lemon drizzle my favorites!
3
Loved the place!! Cozy, modern and well designed. Great place for brunch or a lazy afternoon.I loved their Bolognese pasta and truffle fries (tho lacked in truffle taste so we requested for more oil). Tried their Wagyu burger, but sad to say it was tasteless and dry. Asked for Medium well but got it well done.Will definitely be back at PS Cafe but will have to go with their tried and tested best sellers next time.
5
We wanted a chic cafe with good food for dinner and we found PS cafe at Paragon in Orchard Road. The ambience was nice and staffs were great! The truffle fries was so good our kids ordered twice. The main dishes were excellent too.
4
Pasta, salad and cakes are plenty to choose form. We ate the cakes and coffee. Beer is available as well.
5
I want to commend the staff of PS Cafe Paragon, especially TONI. They all did an excellent service throughout our stay in the restaurant. Toni assisted us and made sure that we were having a great time.
5
Thanks for good service especially JAJA and TONI... food is nice"luxury food in affordable price"
Wow
4
They have excellent sandwiches and the one I tried was the salmon sandwich. The tiger prawn aglio olio is excellent too.
We had coffee and a piece of the chocolate cheese cake and it was absolutely yummy
5
Service was great, especially Toni. He's energetic and outstanding. Great ambience.We had soup of the day - French onion soup. ‚ÄúSuperfood‚Äù with chicken skewer and non-traditional laksa with prawn. Both tasted delicious with extraordinary cooking method. Dessert was double chocolate dark cake with ice cream.Simply Fantastic
4
Food was pleasant. Reasonable variety. Chalk board specials too. Pricy but nice desserts. Service was so so. They can get quite busy. So had to really reach out for ordering extra items. But what's nice is that any person helps with a smile.This place just feels worth a visit. The atmosphere and buzz is quite appealing for those who want to enjoy a venue with some character.
4
Dropped by for coffee. The place was packed but we managed to get a table for 2. My advice would be to reserve a table as that's what most people had done. We opted for 2 slices of cakes and 2 drinks. Go on an empty stomach as the cakes are huge. I am a huge dessert fan and I could not finish either my milkshake or my cake, aptly named doorstop as it was huge. We sat at the alfresco area which is small but still packs a good crowd. I preferred it to the actual cafe as it was airier and brighter and not as noisy. Great place to chill and relax, if you don't mind the constant movement of people
3
Portions are big here which is quite value for money considering its price. There is a good selection of pastas and mains to choose from but desserts are mostly chocolate based. Only 3 sides to choose from but all are best for sharing. Service is pretty average as our waitress had issues carrying the 4 drinks we ordered with 1 hand and asked us to pass them along. Which was fine as we would rather she not spill the drinks on us.
4
...good food ...generous serving...friendly staffwhat more can we ask for...plus first truffle fries that I likedthank you also for Toni and Jaja two of their friendly staff ... plus those we didn't get the chance to get their names.definitely will be going bac
4
The restaurant is a perfect place to meet up with your girlfriends and/or a place for some alone time with a good book. The food is good and tasty and it's a place you will want to go back to.
4
Huge portions, grand location (away from the "hoi polloi").
Service is slow, sometimes unfriendly..
East-west fusion pasta is palatable, flavors married harmoniously.
Beef stew is first rate too
4
I do not how to put this but the beef burger was amazing. Well done on the medium rare steak meat. Amazing dipping sauce for the fries. The beef stew was great too. Service were not exactly very attentive but I can see the crowd is loving the vibes the cafe can offer
1
Was served by a waiter (Vincent) who showed absolutely no interest in helping out a customer when asked for simple suggestions. Typical passive aggressive behaviour which one has grown to expect in singapore service. If you expect people to pay such premium prices, learn how to give even an ounce of premium leave service..
4
Sunday lunch prior to catching our flight. This is another reliable joint in the Paragon mall with a number of other branches around the city. Great menu with something for everyone. My wife had the roast chicken and I had the Portobello stack for lunch. The juices were also equally amazing - refreshing and filling. Great food, done well - service was unobtrusive but attentive. We both gazed longingly at the desserts which are quite fabulous from memory but alas with our diets were not on the menu for us this time.Reliable, comfort food - be prepared to wait if you dont get there early on the weeken
4
Ps. Cafe Paragon was busy and packed but the staff maintained their friendly and attentive manner. So this is a plus factor compared to other busy cafes in Singapore. The usual cafe favourites are in the menu, such as burgers; eggs benedict etc. The wine list is reasonably varied and at least 3 wine options by the glass for whites or reds. I enjoyed the fresh eggs benedict though the bacon rashers could be a bit more generous. The salad was freshly grizzled with light oil. The wine was ok. The price range is what you would expect in Singapore
1
Asked for no greens (salad / vegatable sticks) and have it changed to mash potato. When the food came, fries was alot & I asked the service staff! He then replied the Chef upsized my fries instead... For a $32 bucks Fish & Chips before 10% service charge & 7% taxes! Why the hell would I want more fries when I already knew there is fries in there!Such service standard is worst than any restaurants or food stalls that I have ever dined at! I just told the supplier off that brought me here
4
Food portions are generous and the service staff make an honest effort to be attentive to your requests. The Portobello Mushroom soup was smooth and tasty. The Caesar Salad was refreshing and the main, BBQ ribs was a tad bland but tender enough.A good place for a casual relaxed dining experience
5
Staying close by in Orchard Road, decided to have dinner here. Was really impressed, I had the hamburger, which was really, really good. My partner had the prawn linguine which was also excellent. They also have a selection of wines for takeaway sale which are really pretty good. Definitely would return
5
We had a lovely breakfast here. Getting out of downtown Singapore ad retreating into the hills was perfect for a Sunday.PS. Caf√É¬© is relaxing form the moment you arrive. The delightful food and drinks on offer (awesome coffee) and array of sweet delights in conjunction with the ambiance made this perfect.We will be back
5
Several times we have already eaten there and again this time it was up to expectations. Nice pastas, nice burgers, nice desserts, and so forth. Nice ambience too and the choice to eat indoors or outdoors. Will go back there again, it never fails.
4
A creative and lay back ambiance matched the menu well. The pad thai salad with poached prawns was amazingly good: abundance of balanced flavors , fresh and generous serving. Hope its on the menu next time
3
I had the Big Breakfast and coffee . The bill came up to be about $35 . The food and coffee were above average.
It was not crowded . There was nothing special to the setting . The ambience was average .
5
Been to PS Cafe a number of times and food is always tasty. It is however a little on the expense side. They don't take any reservations so be prepared to queue especially on weekends. The PS Cafe in Dempsey it set in lush tropical surrounds.
4
A good place for brunch. Unfortunately it is not staffed sufficiently, resulting in long waits. If you are not in a hurry it is relaxing to sit and chat. However the food is good when it arrives and is plentiful. Indoor and out door seating, over looking the Thai embassy. A pleasant, relaxed and attractively decorated restaurant. Very busy on the Saturday morning when we went. Only down side was that I ordered my eggs well cooked and the first ones were not, so I returned them, a second plate arrived and was cold, so told the waiter who said I had been given the wrong plate and mine was still cooking! When it came it was perfect and they did not charge for my meal after the mix up. A satisfactory way for a business to ensure return business by acknowledging their mistake. Will certainly go again when in Singapore
4
Was invited to dine here last week and enjoyed the casual vibe of the place on the 3rd level of Paragon along Orchard Road. I enjoyed the portobello mushroom burger served in a soft bun with fries and a small side salad. The staff are most attentive and friendly - always making sure we are at our most comfortable. They have a good selection of wine (with cute bags, to boot).The place caters to the young office crowd - different from their branch at Dempsey's. Looking forward to come back here
3
The cafe seemed short-handed when we were there. We tried the rib eye steak. It was ok, not very impressive. For the price, I think I could get a better steak elsewhere. We also ordered the Caesar Salad and topped it with chicken.The chicken was very hard. We didn't finish the meat
2
First visit to the Paragon branch of PS. Cafe. Had enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere of the original PS. Cafe at Dempsey Road. Was disappointed to find a totally different standard at the Orchard branch. Firstly the service was sub-standard. Had to ask for our drinks 3 times before getting served. And it's not like the staff were busy, considering it was 3pm in the afternoon. Secondly food was so-so, and they got my sandwich order wrong. Not returning for sure.
3
The service was hit and miss with us having to ask for someone to take our order, clear the plates, take a second coffee order and ask for water, whilst the staff wandered aimlessly and never gave eye contact to get their attention. The truffle fries were Ok. The meals were all generous sizes and priced as per expensive Singapore. We loved the ambience and vibe of the cafe but the staff need a lesson in service
5
We had breakfast at PS Cafe because it had interesting dishes on the menu. We shared a brioche and Portobello stack with turkey loaf, poached egg, avocado, rockets, Brie cheese. It was tasty and filling. I had a large slice of M's carrot cake, made with lots of walnuts. The location in the Paragon is very convenient. The servers all are busy but usually friendly, happy, and helpful. One of the staff remembered us from the day before and welcomed us back. My wife tried the coffee, and she said it was very good. We feel PS Cafe is an excellent value in a great location
4
Love the pasta here. Portion is large for Asians. They have daily specials that are not in the menu. The cake is good too.
A little noisy, nonetheless the quality of food helps.
4
Our go-to place whenever we crave for truffle fries. Food in general is good. I find it overpriced, especially the salad. Service is good. Nothing extraordinary but also not disappointing.
5
I have been to the branch at Dempsy a couple of years ago and enjoyed it ,so a friend said she would take me to this one . We had a lovely lunch . I had a mushroom wellington type thing which was really tasty . I thought the service was excellent and the surroundings really nice and relaxing . If you are a lady you must go and see the flower arrangement in the ladies toilet , impressive . We had a thoroughly enjoyable lunch . It was only on the way out I saw the cakes which looked delicious , unfortunately I was going back to the UK the next day so unable to try them 
5
Great bistro-style restaurant at level 3 in the Paragon Mall, located in the heart of the Orchard Road shopping area of Singapore.Wonderful menu with lots of fresh culinary ideas at reasonable prices. Warning: the portions are huge, so look to share any dish. The salads are particularly good, with some original ideas included among traditional salads such as the Caesar. We didn't drink but there is a lot of different wines available, both to drink in house and to buy a bottle from their attached store.One piece of advice - they have another seating section opposite the main restaurant that is wrapped around a pillar. Looks cozy but service very slow in this section as they have to go back into the main restaurant for everything so don't sit there if you are in any kind of hurry
2
This PS Cafe used to be a family favourite a couple of years back when we had to travel to Singapore a few times a month. Haven't been back until yesterday and was so disappointed by the reception that we turned away.After standing around the entrance for a while with no one approaching, we called a waitress for a table for four. She literally rolled her eyes as if our visit was such a burden to her day! Not wanting to give up on our favourite sticky date pudding, we tried to ask another staff for a table, she decided to just walk past without even a nod. We will not be back.PS Cafe, good food but sadly service turned really really bad
4
The menu was excellent. Great choices and prices. Servings are big. The wine menu was extensive but we chose a Pinot Noir and Pinot Gris for the group.The setting was tropical and modern but the air conditioning was too cold and they wouldn't adjust it appropriately. It is a fav restaurant of the group.
4
One of my favourites cafes in Singapore hands down. If you are looking for delicious lunches, WITH big portions. This place is my go-to. It kinda fills up during lunch so best head down a bit early so you wont have to wait.My favourites are the Caeser salad, truffle fries and bread & dips (which is a starter).Btw, on your own, finishing a plate of truffle fries is next to impossible. It's MASSIVE and sprinkled with parmesan, extremely 'truffle-y'. Ask to swap the regular fries that comes with your dish (for the burgers and sandwiches) to truffle fries. They are SOOO good! P.S- they have a huge selection cakes n things for desserts too
4
I have eaten here on multiple occasions and once again ate here about 3-4 times. Its food is always excellent, generous portions, quick and friendly service. Can't go wrong with this place. The Dempsey hill joint has a better ambiance but if you're in the area no reason to not eat here
4
Tired of brunchs , normal coffee shops , then this is the place . Eggs Benedict , in all variations ...stacks of pancakes ...large wedges of cakes A conservatory and open air is also available , makeing it a pleasant place to unwind.My only bug is that the large wedges of cakes were served with ice cream , only 2 types were without . The staff stated that if accompanied by ice cream a cake must come with ice cream and cannot be sold singly .
3
My wife and I had heard about PS Cafe but had never tried it out in the 6 years we have been living in Singapore. I ran into an old friend who mentioned that he was close to the owners and suggested we give it a go. So we did and were pleasantly surprised. We went to the one on Orchard Road in Paragon. My wife ordered the Original Laksa Pesto Spaghettini and I had the Bangers & Cauliflower Pea Mash. The dishes were really tasty and we enjoyed the meal. One drawback was that I expected a bit more from the "Pea Mash", which turned out to be a few peas in mashed potatoes. Still a recommendation for casual lunches or brunces
5
A friend who used to live in Singapore brought me here for Sunday brunch. I had the Waygu burger & it was excellent. Charming little place, hidden in the woods.
5
Love the truffle fries and mushroom soup! Yummy and a generous portion. Laksa pasta is soooo local taste and is tasty. I like the creativity of this dish. A quiet cafe with good ambience. I will definitely come back!
5
the best mushroom soup i can tell you about, and also truffle cheese frites are the best
you also need to try the burger which can share for 2
1
This was our first time here and we were extremely dissapointed by the service and the food. Staff are not attentive, and are unfriendly. Their body language gives us the impression that they are not approachable. Both my fianc√© and I are service staff and we really did not enjoy our time here. We were not approached when we waited for seats and we were not told about the soup of the day. staff product knowledge was bad? I ordered for a pint of beer but came a bottle of beer instead. The staff did not tell us that the beer is served in the bottle. the mushroom soup that we ordered was like creamy water and was tasteless. When we told the staff, she went to the kitchen to ask and came back and told us that the mushroom soup has always been like this and they had received compliments for the soup today. And added on that maybe different people's tastebuds are different. So we don't know whether is the problem the soup? or our tastebuds.. So is she blaming us for our tastebuds? No service recovery was made... Only the soup to be removed from the bill. We decided to come here for dinner as we have read good feedbacks about this place and recommendations from our friends.. We are therefore extremely dissapointed with the food and the experience and the staff

Ate here during our 2 night stopover, and we were really impressed by both service & fayre on offer, you can dine in two adjoining areas, one street side & one air-conditioned, we chose inside! The menu is interesting, with a selection of "Special" Boards as well, however, my good lady and I both chose the "PS. CRISPY ONION BURGER" with chargrilled Wagyu & US chuck patty topped with melted gruyere & mozzarella cheese, tomato, mesclun greens, saut√©ed mushrooms & spiced crispy onions on a toasted sesame bun with shoestring fries.Having never had "Wagyu" Beef before, we were both curious to try it - and the Burger was Simply Superb! Service was attentive without being intrusive, and the ambience was buzzing, this is THE place to dine when in Singapore. Continued Success

We have visited P.S. Cafe many times. It has never disappointed us, even once.Impeccable service, well thought through menu, perfectly cooked, great ambience and romantic setting. Keep a lookout for the dish of the day, the specials which are written out on the blackboard, in addition to the regular menu
4
We have sticky dates pudding with toffee sauce, this is da bomb! Gooey cake with sweet delicious sauce and vanilla ice cream on top. Hot, cold, sweet, perfect. The other one, banana cheese cake and dark chocolate is also good although compared to the pudding, it has lost it's charm. The taste of banana is obvious with the hint of cheese. If the dark chocolate is less sweet it'll be great
4
Read the reviews and thought I'd give this place a go. I visited mid-afternoon and so there was no queue- the waiting staff weren't very friendly but the cashier had ready smiles and was hospitable.The prices are steep specially when dining alone but okay for a treat. I had the truffle fries and banana butterscotch cake. Both were to die for! Delicious and the servings were big. Will definitely come back for either of the dishes I ordered.

When you leave potential customers standing waiting to be seated,when you walk past customers as if they were invisiblenot acknowledging or even saying helloand your outlet is barely 50% occupiedand several staff are milling around insideCOMPLETELY BLIND tothe potential customer who is standing facing your "Wait To Be Seated" Signeventually this customer will walk offThis has happened at this outlet SO MANY TIMES !!Is there any Management to this outlet ?Perhaps staff are learning from this Blind Management

PS Cafe has at least 3 outlets in Singapore, and I may have already reviewed Dempsey Hill previously. This is the Paragon Shopping Mall outlet, and is very convenient, just outside M&S, on the 2nd floor. It is not particularly romantic - it is just great food, very conveniently located. Start with the PS salad, which is ridiculously healthy, then check out their specials. I had seared halibut on wilted greens - delightful, and cooked to perfection. Moist and falling apart. They have 3 nice red wines by the glass - I like the Pinot Noir from NZ, or the Shiraz from Oz. this place will brighten up any shopping trip, I tell you
4
Inside the Paragon mall, this cafe is a good option for a stop and to eat one of the tasty and well prepared sandwiches. I really suggest to try the steak sandwich served with tasty chips.
3
Very noisy - v poor service so why a 10% service charge ?
The MSG got to me about three am !
Wow , there must have been a lot of it in the pie !
Not exactly a bargain price
4
Probably the best coffee option in Paragon. Plenty of sitting, so a good option for meetings over a coffee.
4
We had lunch in this place, good Burger.
The service was fine, OK, no complain at all.
the architecture is nice, different, has some colonial touch on it.
Will I come back, sure....
4
I came here twice during a 1 week trip! The ambiance is really nice and the food is great :) The burger and salads are to die for!
1
The restaurant is very open and has a nice feel to it, which is what attracted us to it, unfortunately, thats where the good vibes ended. Firstly they have not grasped the idea of the piccolo latte (a latte serviced in a small glass). Many cafes worth their reputation sell these in Singapore now...so this was not a good start. The waiters were polite but you could tell they were inexperienced. The meal took ages to come out and when it did, my Big Breakfast was stone cold. Obviously the chef got the timing wrong so it was left waiting for the other meal to be made. I will generally be able to eat pretty much anything served up to me and can't remember the last time I sent food back but I could not eat more than a few mouthfuls. Ever tried eating cold poached eggs that are watery? - puke!! so i sent it back and they were apologetic in a really awkward 'we don't know how to deal with these situations' kind of way. So my partner ate her hot breakfast while I waited for my second attempt. She finished her meal then shortly after, mine came out, this time, it was just warm enough to eat but the eggs were again watery - cooking eggs perfectly (ok not even perfectly...so they are edible) should be a basic skill that any chef serving breakfast is hired to be able to do, but not here. I think they cooked a big batch of bacon when prepping the kitchen prior to service because although it was warm, it was rubbery like eating jerky. I managed to eat half of what was on my plate feeling very dissatisfied and they knew it. To their credit, they did not charge me for my meal. If you are going to serve up a western breakfast, you really need to know what you're doing. I'll never go back and I'll never recommend PS Cafe on Orchard. I believe there is another one at Dempsey...can't see myself eating there either
4
Ps cafe's desserts are mostly to die for. I'd also recommend their truffle fries. As for the main course - some good, some average. They have several locations. My favourite is the one in Dempsey, though it's not really public transportation friendly. The one in palais renaissance (with outdoor seating and some greenery) is nice too, and definitely easier to reach.
4
My wife and I popped in the other day. My wife is a regular but it was my first time to this branch. Enjoyed the food a lot. Good and varied western menu and excellent portions. All food freshly cooked. If you are a fan of truffle fries then I am told they are great - I am not a fan of truffle oil, so cannot vouch for them but my wife is and said they were very good. Variety of artisan breads. Really enjoyed the coffee and the cakes on offer are lovely although best shared as the portions and price are large!Service was quite friendly although a little curt at times
4
Loved the place. Loved the interior and lighting. It was perfect for valentines for a good and reasonable budget.I just wanna commend the staff who was in charge of showing guests to their table. A lady, forgot her name. She did an excellent job. Great customer service. We requested to switch tables and despite the tight schedule that night, considering it was Valentines, she made our request with a genuine smile on her face. Also the guy who waitered for us. I regret not getting their names. We had several requests that night and he was just a delight to have helped us in every single one. We could see him working so hard that night as well as he was sweating a lot. Poor guy but kudos to him. And to the lady in the frontdesk. I hope their management can read this. I rarely do reviews on restaurants. Best,Car

Had a evening meal nearby. Decided to have a coffee and cake with a friend. I must say its one of the best cakes on Orchard. Atmosphere is really nice and not crowded. Look forward to my next time in.
5
One of the best burger and truffle fries joint in Singapore. Must try the deserts and the days specials...
4
Had brunch here with my family. The food is great especially the burger... Massive servings that will quench your hunger... Highly recommended....
4
It's the same guys from Dempsey. Great food, good for quiet sit down to read. Salads and sandwiches are really good in flavor and portion. You won't leave unhappy.
Quality of staff can be greatly improved. Standard at Dempsey is so much better.
3
There a few PS Cafes and this one at Paragon is always crowded. They now have an electronic queue system and they will sms to acknowledge that you are in the queue and there is a link to find out how many people are ahead of you in the queue. It is interesting to see there were many empty tables and registration on the electronic queue system is still required. I received an automated phone call that our table was ready. We waited for almost 5 minutes before somebody noticed us and came to bring us to our table. There were flowers at each table but the water had turned brown and the flowers had wilted - not a happy sight to greet diners. Little details do matter
4
Had dinner here recently and was glad to see the laksa pesto spaghettini and roast chicken sandwich still on the menu. Two of my favorites from the time the cafe was located in a different part of the mall overlooking the paragon driveway. These two dishes were as delicious and satisfying as I remembered. Thank you PS Cafe for keeping these classics on the menu! The service was brisk and efficient as ever. Great pit stop for a coffee or a meal when shopping along Orchard Road
4
Being an western restaurant the portions are huge, I've tried chicken wings, bread platter, burgers and few other items. The main course is good but deserts were to die for. I returned to have ginger cr√®me brul√© and ginger pudding. I'm going back again to have deserts
3
Cool cool ambiance but do go before lunch...its swamped and my order was delayed for 1 hour.Each time I queried I was told it was 10 minutes away.So, if you have time to spare then try the onion burger.The fries are perfect and the Thai Salad...divine.The wine selection is unpretentious and pairs well with the food.Just have to get the service on par though
5
so far had breakfasts at the PS Paragon, decided to try dinnerordered the pork ribs with string-shoe friesgo figure.....of all the place I have ordered ribs (and I have been around!)one of the best rack of ribs I have ever had!!!fries were very goodslaw was a bit too fresh for me (as a result not soft enough to chew comfortably)but this rack of ribs....WOW,, the amount of meat on the bone was probably to most I have ever had.perfectly smoked to prefectionthe sauce was good too.....but the real zinger was the meat quality, EXCEPTIONAL
3
On the positive side : good decor , well designed. Good coffee and good selection of juices and fruit cocktails. However this has become a very expensive venue for what it is really. The fruit cocktails are at 10 Sing , the cappuccino at 9 Sing. Salads for 26 Sing Dollars.. And they should really stop putting Truffle Oil everywhere ( fries, omelette ..!) as well as seaweed on fries ?! The food now has become really strange .
3
There is no doubt that PS serves some of the best and most innovative food in the neighbourhood. We had the mushroom soup, chicken cacciatore, veggie pasta and scallop risotto and all were superb. It's just a shame that the service is so mediocre. Alas, when everyone gets 10% regardless of how they perform and management is at a spa somewhere, this is what you get..
4
Decent portion. Nice brunch and cakes. we ordered pasta as well. it is quite ok.Good for family or friends gathering.
4
100 likes the sweet nice munchy cake , We tried Carrot cake one that so good with lemon ginger drink just ok , I had lemon lime juice and love it refreshing and ready to shopping around
3
Like many places in Singapore when you add 10% service charge and 7% Gst cost go up.
30 minute wait so the place is popular.
5
Very recommended. Large selection of dishes. Breakfast, Lunch, Afternoon Tea/Coffee, Dinner and just casual drinks. Very good pastries and cakes as well. Try the one at Dempsey Hill as well.
3
This is my first time trying truffles fries and I must say that it is unbelievably great portion and most importantly very tasty! It wasn't oily or too salty. Strongly recommend as a starter!
4
This is the third PS Caf√© we've been to. We've already been to several many times. I had the crispy onion burger with fries which was OK, nothing special but not bad either. Fair. My partner had the spaghetti bolognaise and she said it was one of the best she's had so far in Singapore. Cherry tiramisu was definitely better than expected although the drinks (sangria and lemon/lime soda) could' ve been better. The staff was very helpful, nothing to complain there. The location is a bit strange and gives it a bit of a strange feel as well, being in the middle of a shopping center
5
This was our last meal in Singapore and where better than PS Cafe! We were at Orchard and specifically chose PS. We order the Spare Ribs, I had the Beef Stew, Sausage with apple sauce, and a Pasta for my wife. ALL the dishes were spectacular! Then after being stffed, still managed to order the heavenly chocolate pie, with heavenly chocolate sauce, and heavenly ice-cream!! WHAT can go wrong? other than many many calories!!! (This was our second PS Cafe meal, will review other one separately) and we will KEEP GOING BAC
5
As an out of towner I'm not sure if the PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance - 390 Orchard Road - is this one, but if it is, it's excellent. A lovely touch at the bar on entering is the selection of international newspapers. Their (Gin) Dry Martini is New York quality - and size! We chose a table on the terrace overlooking the embassy gardens next door - Thai? High ceilings, tiled terrace feel, potted plants. The service was smooth, skilled, elegant. Fascinating, imaginative menu. We had a glass of their white house wine with miso cod, and crab tart, both with lively fresh salad with lemon and sesame dressing. We then shared a humungous slice of their double chocolate blackout cake, which was absurd. It tasted of sensuous dark chocolate but could, if thrown hard enough, have sunk a battleship. Presentation of all dishes, was excellent. We had wanted something a little bit special for lunch while touring the Orchard Road shops. This came highly recommended by locals, who know these things. We were not disappointed. Not cheap - but things a little special rarely are! We loved it
5
This is one of my favourite cafes in Singapore to get my coffee fix. I like its system for queuing ...very efficient.My family and I never come here for full meal, but for resting after shopping or just simply to enjoy its latte, cappuccino and cakes.My children and my mom love its double chocolate blackout cake, truffle shoestring fries, and chocolate fudge cake. My husband and I love its key lime pie.P.S Caf√© serves one of the best latte and cappuccino in Singapore and its staffs make the time to serve pretty cappuccino
4
Strategically situated in one of the upper levels of Paragon Shopping Centre, this cafe is a great place to enjoy a coffee and a lovely detection of light meals and cakes. You could go there after a shopping spree or to catch up with friends and have a lovely afternoon.anything you select off the menu will leave you very satisfied. Make sure you are sharing your slice of cake with someone because it's not a slice it's a huge chunk.Sit back, relax and enjoy your afternoon cuppa
3
I was told Ps.cafe is one of the most fancy cafe in Singapore. It was true, I think. But it was too close to next group. The volume of the dishes were small. Anyway you can eat fancy Italian food at the fancy cafe.
5
Beautiful atmosphere. The place is very nice. The desserts are wonderful. Recommended for dinner and after dinner
3
The main course ("THE ORIGINAL LAKSA PESTO SPAGHETTINI" ) was not anything special or particularly good and rather dry. The fries were a bit too oily. The service was average without attempts to deliver good service; rather it was just the service of delivering the food. Moreover the staff at the restaurant do not seem to listen and automatically assume customers do not understand the procedure of getting a SMS as a wait list number --> When i went up to ask for the wait time before even finishing the sentence I was impolitely asked to just go over on their computer to give them my phone number as if I was clueless to not have realised to get the number beforehand. The ambience of the restaurant was not to my liking as it achieved neither the ambience of a cafe or a restaurant.
5
The Chef hear has got it perfectly right.I am at PS Cafe Paragon as I write this review and my mouth is watering from just viewing every dish derparting the kitchen on its one to another glorious patron. The food is not only looks great....it even tastes better. The amazing thing is that the menu is so simple; no fireworks and over-ambitious extravaganza, and yet everything hear just tastes MUCH better than anywhere else.Its obvious that the chef of PS not only has a passion for food, he has a rare gift at keeping simply excellent
4
PS Cafe is the perfect place to take a break after long hours of shopping. The cafe has a casual, cozy, and young feel.We ordered the double chocolate black out cake to share. It's one of the best I've ever tasted! The chocolate icing has the perfect degree of sweetness and the texture of the cake was has a perfect balance of being crumbly and moist. We had the milkshake and kiwi-cucumber juice with it. Both were also good.The wait staff was friendly, but they can be more alert. It took a bit of time before a server saw us and approached our table to take our food order.Although I personally find the price somewhat on the high side for a casual dining restaurant (SGD16 for a slice of cake), I'd say that it's still worth it because the cake was excellent and the serving was good enough for two persons.Tip: It might be easier to get a table on a weekday. We went there on a Friday afternoon and didn't have to wait for a table. We returned on Saturday during lunch and there was queue so we decided to go elsewhere
4
Not my favourite PS Cafe but still good. The location is convenient but not very attractive to someone like me who doesn't like shopping malls. The decor is good and it's nice to have the separate cafe area with a bit more light. Good food and ok value
2
Overpriced below average food with poor rude service - just like the rest of the reviews mention here. I honestly don't know why staff are employed in this restaurant if they cant speak English, it just adds extra pressure and workload to the other staff who can and are trying to cover their own tables
3
PS Cafe at Paragon has a very chill-out ambience, good place for a date. The food, however, is quite average. We tried the Laksa Pesto pasta and the Beef Ragout. The Laksa Pesto was a bit too dry for my liking, and most of the tastiness was absorbed by the taupok (fried bean skin). The Beef Ragout was OK, nothing special
5
Had our Valentine dinner here. No more online or on-site reservations allowed during that day so we just went there and luckily, in less than a minute we got our seats. Prices are on the higher scale but it's all worth it. Huge servings and service is great
1
The staff were not at all enthusiastic about serving you. The cafe has a nice ambience and is well , The food might even be good. Alas, the silly policies would deter one from trying it. I sat down with my helper and my 7 month old baby. I ordered a coffee and my helper just wanted water. It was a weekday and the cafe was empty except for one table. After I ordered I was told that there is a one drink and one paid food item policy at the cafe. This was told to me after I sat down and after I ordered. Why was this policy not listed at the door. Why was is not displayed clearly such that the patrons know what the cafe requires as a minimum order. This made my helper understandably uncomfortable. My helper should not be made to feel uncomfortable by the cafe staff. My helper said that she might order something later on. That's not bad enough. My baby was sick and no staff came to help. Poor service and poor policy. There are so many other cafes on the orchard area. You shouldn't go to this one. And this is not the first time that PS CAFE has behaved badly. Their Duxton branch also created a brouhaha over nothing the last time we were there. I am sorry. Your food might be good. Too bad your service is not and you policies are not welcoming.
3
Is always crowded. Well, is not a cheap cafe but their serving is big. I nornally go for their coffee and apple galette.
Quite a grear place for Desert lover , not a bad place.
5
We had an excellent brunch. The big PS cafe breakfast and the cheese and caramelized onion quiche. In one word superb.
The location is a real little gem in the forest on Dempsey Hill.
Worth a visit for just a coffee, brunch or lunch.
4
Nice atmosphere, with a buzz. Food is very good, but some may see it pricey a bit. Better to make a reservation as it quickly fills up on meals time.
4
I have to say the food quality is good. the burger I had was a bit dry. The coffee was nice. The orange cake is highly recommended. It's pricy. It does come with a price tag
3
Great Ambience, a little pricey Id say! Chilled out a little! Had a iced mocha and some toffee pudding................
3
While the food quality is good, I found the prices very expensive for what you got and the service very slow. I met someone there for a business lunch and it took us 2 hours from the time we sat to the time we left.
4
We came here for lunch - sometimes my partner needs a Western food break. He ordered Big Breakfast: eggs, toast, bacon, sausage, beans and tomatoes while I had the truffle fries. We also had the Alright Orange and Mellow Yellow juices. The Alright Orange was a little too "carroty" for me but Mellow Yellow was good. The truffle fries were huge shoestring fries with good truffle scent but not enough parmesan shavings for my liking. The shavings were on top and centre of the mound of fries so by the time you ate the top layer, there was no cheese left. It was tasty and if I crave truffle fries, would come back. My partner enjoyed his breakfast. It did seem like a somewhat small portion but he was satisfied. The place is pricy as this is an foreigner's hangout. Everyone in the restaurant was Caucasian so I knew it was going to be expensive. Overall, if you like what's on the menu and are willing it pay, it's a nice break. Service was alright, not super attentive but not negligent either. They have seating outside in the hallway of the mall and they also have a selection of wines
3
We booked well in advance for our party of seven ladies who lunch. The food was good but the service was disappointing. We had to ask waitresses several times to refill our drinks when they should have been attentive so they can make more on beverages. At one point I was irritated that the waiter preferred to sweep the restaurant rather than serve guests who were trying to get the attention of any servers. Its not that they are short of staff but they were concerned with manning the reception table and cleaning the place to fit in more customers instead of attending to the needs of the existing customers. (and walking about to ensure this) I have been to other PS Cafes in Dempsey were the staff are better organised and even Palais Renaissance - where the staff tell you the place is fully booked if you forgot to reserve in advance. Better to serve guests well than cramp everyone in and don't serve them properly is what I say and hope the management can take note. We were there in early part of January 2015.Food prices were fair at 25 a head but separately 5 coffee and 2 delicious cakes came up to 87 - you judge for yourself
2
While the food was barely artisanal considering all the other cafes I've been to all over the world, the service is pale. With over 10 people on shift and more than 5 empty tables, there was still room to make customer wait in line. The queue got longer and longer as service staff pretended customers didn't exist. Had a fish and chips, milkshake and chocolate cake. Nothing fantastic and I have no idea what the hype is about.

Visiting SG and my friends took me here because I saw one of them post a photo of their truffle fries in IG and was curious. When it came to our table, we couldn't stop munching on them until out orders arrived. Their servings are huge! We were all so stuffed after.Now, we had a table outside when we arrived just before lunch because all tables inside were occupied. That was fine, but proved to be a challenge because they seemed to be low on waitstaff and we sometimes had to resort to calling their attention while someone is in the cash register which was very close to our table outside. I was a bit disappointed with the lack of warmth in their service, no smiles, and we also got scolded (a bit) for asking for an extra table because some of our friends confirmed too late that they are coming. Aren't they supposed to be happier for the extra money their orders would bring? Oh, and if it was a challenge to get their attention for the service we need, when I asked for the bill they produced it in no time. Food-wise, the truffle fries are overwhelming, it's good, but too much in a plate. I also ordered their burger which had fries too on the side so I saw way too many fries that morning. We also noted that my side fries were not as crunchy as the truffle fries which must have been served right after they fried it. The burger wasn't really anything special, I found the patty to be too bland. One of us ordered the aglio olio pasta which he said was good. Another ordered the eggs benedict dish which she seemed to have enjoyed. Another also had the big breakfast plate, she didn't really rave about anything in her dish. I did note though that when she was ordering that and was asked if she'd like the eggs scrambled or sunny side up, when my friend asked back if she can have one of each since there are two eggs, she was told only one type. Really, how much of a challenge would it be for their kitchen staff to prepare eggs two ways? I enjoyed my time with friends but not the place. I don't think I'd ever come back here next time I am in SG
5
everthing is just excellent!! of the various locations, the one at harding road is absolutly beautiful! very upsacle, not too expensive, definate must
3
Had the fish and chips and it was the best I have ever had .... The food here has been amazing and we came back a second time on our last day here because it was so good ! Highly recommended
5
Great atmosphere a pity you cannot make a reservation. Great for a coffee or just a desert. Drinks at the outdoor terrace with a view on the beautiful garden, romantic!

I had dinner with my friend at PS CAFE Paragon and we both reached around 8.30pm last night. Personally, that timing is not too late for dinner considering they are closing at 10.30pm. Please also note that they weren't running full house as the empty tables suggested.Issue #1:While being brought to our seats, the waitstaff escorted us to our table, placed the menu on the table and left us without saying a word or smile. And we weren't even seated yet as she left us alone. Is this a norm for PS Cafe waitstaff to do so?Issue #2:I ordered Beer Battered Fish and Chips + Truffles Fries among others. To my disappointment, the fish was served in such a small portion (2 small fillets), it did not do any justice to the price that I had paid for ($32). And just when I thought I could brush it aside, the fish tasted so bland and there was no seasoning whatsoever. The fries that came with it has no seasoning or taste. To top it all off, the Truffles Fries which was the highlight and main reason of dining at PS Cafe Paragon, turned out to be a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The Truffles Fries was served with no significant smell of ANY Truffle Oil nor has it and seasoning (it tasted just like regular unseasoned fries like the one that came with the fish and chips). This is a huge difference between the one we have had at Dempsey outlet. It may be my first time trying the fish and chips (and trust me, I wouldn't want to order that again), but Truffles Fries, that's my countless time getting from PS Cafe, but my first at Paragon outlet and to be very honest, the cook (not chef) is humiliating the PS Cafe branding. Is PS Cafe that desperate to compromise on the service quality of their food? Were they running low on Truffle Oil? Is this some cost cutting measure? Whatever it is, it is unacceptable.Needless to say, we asked for the bill, and we did not finish the mountain of fries to show our displeasure. However, waitstaff June, did not even bother to ask if everything was okay or how was the food or to as why we didn't finish our food. Again, no smiles, no thank yous. And I have had it with everything and everyone there and we left.As a consolation, the only thing which was commendable and tasty was the Roast Chicken Sandwich. But after having to pay $92, I expected mind blowing food that I know PS Cafe can produce, even if the service staff is lacking in basic manners...Paragon outlet really need to buck up!!!!!!!!!!!!
4
We are fan of PS cafe and visited many PS cafe, this branch is live up to its name for nice atmosphere, nicely decorated, nice selection in menu and the most important, delicious food. Service was ok for this type of concept. We will be back again and again
3
I am guessing that here the prices reflect the location in Palais Renaissance (an ironic building name for a place right by Orchard Towers non?). The surroundings are very pleasant with an art deco style outdoor seating area which I prefer or an inside area which is all dark tiles and knee to knee seating.Obviously a place for the 'ladies who lunch' with designer labels wafting past in clouds of expensive and sometimes very seductive perfumes. But I digress. The menu here is actually 'solid' ie all the standards e.g .burgers,spaghetti etc often with a PS twist but overall uninspiring and when oh when will they change it up and show some imagination? Even the daily specials are are best stolid. The quality is consistently reasonably average to good and I have never had a 'bad' meal there but I do find myself tiring of its mundane predictability.The staff are unfailingly attentive and pleasant and probably overall the best facet of this particular PS outlet. But the prices,the prices!! For what is a cafe albeit a self elected 'upmarket' one,these are ridiculous for what you get. Singapore now has many much better options than PS so its time they wake up and smell their own coffee before they really do become a postscript themselves on the Singapore dining scene
1
visited their recently opened Martin Road outlet for breakfast. 6.50 for a latte (served lukewarm instead of hot), an undercooked egg benedict covered with heaps of tin sauce, service is slow and staff is inattentive. Just in case you fancy a glass of Chateau Neuf Du Pape, it is SGD 29....would I come back: N
3
I love this place but after my last visit I think its no more. The salad portion size was all wrong. The croutons were way to big and somehow or other it did not just hand together. My partners salad which is one he always order when we go there was flat and just lacked something.Maybe its been to good for too long and now coasting along. I cant suggest any alternatives that are better so if you are in the area call by but dont make a special tri

Three of us went to this outlet just before lunch at 1130.We were swiftly shown to a table by a friendly waitress, who cleaned the table and chairs for us and brought us menus.We then waited ... and waited. Given the restaurant was only half full, pre lunch, we were surprised. The waitresses seemed to be rushing around a lot. After some time, we called a waitress over to take our order and she took the order efficiently and was friendly.We then waited ... and waited again. After we waited 20 minutes had watched a few tables that came after us get served their food, we still did not even have our drinks. We asked the waitress after our food and, amazingly, everything (burger, french fries, banana crumble, bruschetta, shake, 'goody green' and cappuccino) all arrived within 3 minutes.Disappointingly, most of it was cold. Even the crumble, you would expect to be piping hot in the middle, to melt the ice cream served with it, was cold on the outside and luke-warm in the middle.However, all the food WAS delicious.Conclusion being the chef was doing a consistent and great job, providing food PS Cafe is famous for but the front-of-house was letting him down for reasons that escape us
3
PS Cafe is always good with their food. Service is alright too at Paragon and perhaps also at Palais. Not sure about Dempsey outlet cos it is always overcrowded so the service there always sucks. Prices are relatively high too but at least the food is good. Paragon outlet has the worse ambience. Love the other PS Cafe's ambience though
1
Nothing appealing in the menu
Service is so long
We only ordered fries.. Still hasnt come, 30 minutes!!!
The water tastes like edamame
Im so hungry
1
Waited 10 minutes to be served, and only because we asked.
Wanted a milkshake for my children. No ice cream. No milkshake. No apology.
No next time, which is a pity because they usually make decent coffee.
2
Coffee wasn't very nice although my friend really enjoyed the hot chocolate. Only 4 breakfast choices. Both of us didn't enjoy our choices and left disappointed. Very expensive for nothing much. The lady who served us was very attentive. Will not be returning.

Wow!! Amazingly delicious cake I cannot put into works the taste of the cake.. Big portion and nice taste. A lil bit pricy but it's very nice to seat down and chit chat and a good atmosphere.

We had a great party for 30 people at the bar on the highest floor of the PS Cafe closed to Club Street. Great atmosphere and nice service.

First time to PS at this branch in paragon. Was unplanned as the other restaurant was full but we were glad to visit!Both me and my friend ordered a burger and we were wowed by it. My friend said her vegetarian burger is still one of her best she ever tasted. I like my chicken burger. Quite costly though, total bill was about $80 for 2 burgers and 2 non alcoholic drinks

A really place to relaxe chat over a Coffee & Cake... Food looked really nice will be back to give it a try.. However my choice for a coffee/cake/NoInternet... Think I will find a nice coffee a a free wifi just down the road.... Somehow shop owners in Singaopre think they can get away with not griving free wifi... That I must say I am not happy.

I am a frequent visitor to PS cafe Paragon..Malaysian Chilli Chicken is a feat for the senses..a delicious marinaded chicken leg served with quinoa with cashew nuts...topped with pineapple, chilli, red onion, mint leaves, coriander....it is literally an explosion of taste. I am also a huge fan of their Green Veggie pasta....again a healthy combination of broccoli, peas, green beans topped with shavings of fresh Parmesan....great wine selection...great deserts....one of my favourite places in Singapore

Made a reservation for three but only two of us turned up, so we decided to proceed with dinner - a lovely girls' night out and HTHT at PS Cafe, Paragon. Yes, there are five (5) outlets of PS Cafe, but we chose Paragon's because it was the most convenient branch for us at the point in time. Hence, the address for this cafe rebuilt of glass, steel and brick is located at 290 Orchard Road, level 3, Paragon Shopping Centre, Singapore 235589 and the number to dial is 6735 6765.The unique point about PS Cafe - besides serving good food and mouth-watering desserts, is that every individual outlet has a different vibe and theme. Therefore, one could try all five outlets and not get bored of the menu selectionsMicaela* and I started with the Triple Cheese Penne - a delicious, cheesy mornay accompanied by a refreshing valencia orange and garden green salad. The piping hot Triple Cheese Penne was similar to baked macaroni and cheese dish, with a top layer of thick, sticky and chewy, slightly-crispy cheese piled atop soft al-dente oven-baked penne. The overall taste was a rich, cheesey delight.Next, it was time for desserts. Micaela* had been eyeing the Chocolate Fudge Brownie with Pecans - a very generous portion of thick, rich and rough brownie with tasty pecan nuts and large chunks of soft marshmallows. The brownie was a tad dry though, but we loved it paired with the smooth, sweet vanilla ice-cream.For more detailed information and photos, do check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/02/dinner-at-ps-cafe.htm

Went along for a quick bite but the standards of food and service were just hopeless. First time we've visited this outlet - the one at Ann Siang Hill is always lovely but it's liek the two cafe's are unrelated.i beef burger, one chicken burger, one salad and one fries were over $125 - the food was only average but the most disappointing thing was the staff attitude. Barely a word spoken to us, no greeting, menus dropped on the table as they walked past, had to ask for water and for our order to be taken - waiter seemed to deliberately misunderstand (we wanted to have fries instead of potato - we got both and were charged accordingly), then they just retreated to the back room and I had to get up to find someone to ask for the (very expensive!) bill!It's obvious the staff don;t want to be there, don't want to serve and do the very bare minimum (they get topped anyway as it's added to the bill).Very lacklustre - we couldn't wait to finish and leave and will not be back to this outlet ever again.Appalling

The atmosphere was ok, a bit crowded on lunch time, highly recommended truffle shoestring fries, ps caesar salad, if you dont like bitter spinach, dont order salad. The beverages are standard. You should order more than 1 portion of food otherwise you wont be served.

You have to try their Creme of Portobello Mushroom w Truffle
Magazine stand inside gives it a nice touch
Very relaxing to be there.
Service was average, nothing out of the ordinary.
But the food is really GREAT!

Another gem from the PS Cafe group.. Do something about the Dempsey one..

A restaurant with decent food, a good location and with attractive decor should be a more pleasant experience. The staff and service let this place down. Waiting a while, our friend we were meeting being shown to another table even after describing us, and lack of attention, combine to give a 'we don't care' atmosphere.Which is a shame, as the truffle fries are excellent
1
We arrived and waited around 15 minutes for a table at the entrance, the waiter told us that he will give us another table in the main dining room and in the meantime we can order, we did (a soup, a salad and a club sandwich) and we waited. 30mn later, we asked to the waiter for the table and the food, and he said that we need to wait for another 15mn for the food and there is no table (but we saw a lot of people arriving and having a table in the main room) so we left....

Went for a solo dinner and ordered Truffled fries (very hard consistency, poor oil taste), Christmas Turkey with sides (horrible tasting dish altogether, had also been kept warm too long) and apple cake with butterscotch (tasted burnt).The red wine was mediocre, just served to wash down the bad taste of the dishes.Overpriced and bad service on top of that.Not recommended

Have been a fan of PS Cafe for many years. Coffee is conistently good, service is efficient and the selection of magazines when travelling on your own makes for an overall pleasant experience.Whilst I will continue to return to PS Cafe on future trips, I hope they improve their salad selection. Chicken salad with only a couple of pieces of chicken for about $28 is pretty steep by anyone's standards. If there was a decent portion of chicken it would be ok. I had a similar experience with the kofte salad at PS Cafe in Palais the following night for dinner.Soups were wonderful. Had the sweet chowder and was a treat! Staff were friendle as always.Will be back - but please beef up the salads

We decided to try out this cafe / restaurant. Looks a little unique as it was a restaurant / boutique selling of bags and accessories. Decided to have a sit and try it out. All day sandwich and a burger, it was okay. Nothing to shout about. Nothing extra ordinary and I certaintly dislike the presentations of the food. Makes it really hard and inconvenient to bite. However, my ice chocolate shake was brilliant and would definitely love another one. Other than that, I find that this restaurant hasn't satisfy me and would costs quite a bit for two person on breakfast. Costs Sgd 90 with just moderate food. Waiters were friendly however didn't pay too much attention to us as we were asking for the bill and waited for about five minutes. Not too sure if one was a trainee, but cleared cutleries on the trays were fallen off for multiple times during my session here.Would need lots of improvements or it would definitely go down.

I am one of Singapore's biggest fans of PS cafe - Ann Siang Hill, Dempsey, the other one on Orchard - they all rock, so its seriously disappointing to see the PS Cafe in Paragon continue to nose dive due to bad service. The food's still good, although it took the two of us one hour to be served a basic salad, unheard of in the other high service locations. A shame because everywhere else gets it so right.I've been pretty consistently over the past year, and each time, I hate to say it, the service here gets worse. Overworked staff who you have to ask repeatedly for basic things like a glass of water or salt and pepper, let alone getting your order in which took forever. In return for being overworked the poor staff come across as non service oreinteted, tainted, and rude.Come on PS Cafe - get back to what you were good at...

Projectshop serves obscenely huge portions of cake. Three of us struggled with a gooey & most unsubtle chocolate cake which I found much too heavy. The service was decidedly lukewarm, with the waiters poncing around trying to look cool, & obviously desperate to shut up shop & go home
