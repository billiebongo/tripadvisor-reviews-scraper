So our friends from Singapore always take us to interesting places and this very small restaurant was no exception. It's known for the dishes mentioned above and they were special and very tasty. if you're going for lunch go early because it can get crowded!

My husband had wanted to eat this fishball noodles after hearing about it. Three of us went on a Saturday night at about 8pm. It was already quiet. They place was kept clean. My husband ordered the hock chew fishball in kway teow with meat dumplings and the fish paste in 'yan pi'. I had the hock chew fishball with wanton in kway teow. My daughter ordered the fish slice soup with rice. To me, it was a disappointing meal. The fishball was not tangy. It was starchy. And there was no taste of fish. The meat in the ball was of a reasonably size and not so fragrant. Not tasty, but salty enough. The meat dumpling was a bit of a saving grace, but the wanton was not tasty too, though it was salty enough. They were just not flavourful. The fish slice in soup was not too bad...a bit pricey for that few slices of Shen-Yu or snakehead fish, not enough vegetables in it - some bits of lettuce, no toufu no bitter gourd. Oh, we decided to order the fried chicken wings. Asked if it was prawn paste chicken, the lady said yes. What came was just small fried chicken drumsticks, 3 pieces and 3 small fried wings. All that that $6. Not cheap. No prawn paste either. I probably could get better hock chew fishballs and fish soup with rice elsewhere; I would not go back there to eat

This is a Fuzhou eatery out. Worth trying would be the dumpling made out of beaten fish paste to form the wrapping skin. The filling is minced meat. It is a relishing dish to sink your teeth into it. There are also other dishes worth try at a very resonable pric

I think my expectation on this restaurant is really high. I had been here 2 times, my first visit seems quite good but the 2nd one I am truly disappointed. We ordered quite a few to share.1. Foochow fish ball and dumpling - I tried at some other places which seems tastier, and the fish ball more Q. This is average.2. Red Wine Noodles - the Mee Sua is too soft, probably because we had it late. The soup more towards sweet taste. This is average.3. Foochow lor Mee - very sticky gravy but the staff did told me that it is sticky version. Taste quite ok. This is average4. Stir fried rice cake - a bit weird combination. The rice cake is too hard. This totally failed5. Deep fried rice cake - not too sweet but feel over fried so this is average.Therefore j gave an average for all the dishes that I tasted. Will I come back again? Probably if I really craving for Foochow food and I cannot find any other better else where

I have eaten countless noodles in my life, this is the One and Only noodle place that I have tasted such an amazing meat ball. I ordered the #4 dish Foo Chow Combination from the menu. Can't tell what type of sauce they used to marinate it. The taste still lingering in my mouth even after a day. The noodle sauce was flavorful as well. I have thanks the owner numerous times for the delicious handmade meat balls and noodle they have created. Totally worth the visit, will definitely try out once again and more of other dishes

Wife and I had dinner there. While we have had better food, it was very good, and the value for money would be very hard to beat.I had mixed dumplings in soup, wife had fried and steamed fish. Both came with noodles. Also provided were chillies and chilli sauce

The stall used to be located at a nearby corner shophouse along Beach Road, where we used to buy some Fuzhou fish balls home for use in steamboat during Chinese New Year reunion dinner. I have not been to the present location since they moved here until today.The traditional Fuzhou fish balls are handmade with minced pork stuffed inside, and the fish meat are not as crunchy or bouncy as the common fish balls. The other traditional Fuzhou specialty is the meat dumpling which are minced porks wrapped in "skins" made by mixing minced pork with sweat potato flours and hammering them into thin wrappers, ready for use once they are air dried. The skin or better known as "Yan Pi" (in Chinese literally means "Swallow Skin") are translucent when cooked.The Fuzhou fish balls and meat dumpling (Rou Yan) here still retained the traditional flavour, though the meats seems to have a little lesser seasonings than before. The noddles' texture was very good with just the right degree of crunchiness. But the soup was a bit of a disappointment as it tasted quite plain comparing to the older stall. Nevertheless it was still an enjoyable meal and glad to rediscover some of these traditional food stalls around.The stall opens from 10am to 10pm daily. During lunch hours the shop is packed with office workers in the area so to avoid the crowd go before 12pm or after 2pm
