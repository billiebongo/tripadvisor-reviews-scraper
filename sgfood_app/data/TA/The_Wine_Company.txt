The Wine Company maintained its service offerings. Its still a nice place to wind down with a Glass of Wine and a Snack. Nice is that this place offers some South African Wines, different from he usual Australian/New Zealand dominance in Singapore.

Only 3 (3!!!) different wines at glass to be chosen, moreover of poor quality. You're forced to buy a bottle if you want something else.
Ordered 2 bruschettas which I barely could see, given the tiny size!
I'll never repeat.

We were a big group and we decided to sit at the back section of the place (called the "Woods"). Everything was just great: the service, wine selection, appetizers (excellent Italian sausage, calamari and cheese platters. All in a nice quiet outdoors area, not an easy feat in Singapore

Met up with a couple of friends for some wine yesterday evening. Casual ambience and lots of outdoor seating. We chose to sit inside which was quite pleasant. Selection of wines was good but not extensive. The menu which consisted primarily of Singapore style starters did not provide for the best pairing with good wine. We managed to get a platter of cold cuts (which was average) and that particular item was was easy to find on the menu. We settled on a bottle of Rioja (rated 92 points by Robertson) which was not too overpriced. Service was only average.

Went for dinner and was looking for a good wine and some comfort food. Food was poor and so was service. The waiters did not know their wine .... at all. U did manage to find a good bottle if wine but over it was a disappointing experience. Inside the restaurant there is a funny smell of cooked food and bad ventilation. On the patio. It's pretty hot and the car traffic that's just in front makes for a bit so relaxing environment . I would not recommend

Last night, visited and dine at The Wine Company with an overseas friend. Wanted to share Dempsey Hill with him.!Was there at 8pm - 10pm, restaurant was 90% filled. Cleaned restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. A new revised menu. No longer serving lemongrass chicken rice and lemongrass jelly.Had fried rice with egg, rojak and grilled salmon with drinks. Nice ambience, tasty food at affordable price.Enjoyed

The Dempsey location of The Wine Company actually has two restaurants with the same menu at this location. The Woods is behind The Wine Company and you can sit both inside and out. The Woods offers a nice lush view which is fitting for its name. Menu is reasonably priced and offers something for everyone in your group. You can get anything from char kway teow and mushroom pesto risotto to pizza or a steak. Of course, they offer a good selection of wines and the menu has been thoughtfully prepared with a wine recommendation for each dish. Enjoy

The food was very good and venue ok but service seemed to be sub standard - not able to keep drinks flowing and meals all came out at different times. I would not be in a hurry to come back -even though I really enjoyed the main course salmon

On 2 November 2016, visited The Wine Company Changi Village Branch located at Level 1 of Village Hotel. Indoor and outdoor seating. Cosy clean restaurant but shortage of service staff.Pathetically the restaurant has 1 - 2 waiters who need to di everything imcluding taking order, serving meal, collecting payment. Food took about 25 minutes to be served.Food still tastefully good, similar with Dempsey outlet. Enjoyed the meal.

Great place to meet, chill out and get a conversation going over their selection of wine among lush greenery and open space. We were actually diverted to Woods, which is situated behind the Wine Company.Select a wine from their extensive menu and the staff is on hand to advise accordingly. We had 2 bottles of the lovely Terredavino Barolo Paesi Tuoi 2009.Then select some nibbles to pair with the wine. The menu can be very Asian but not to fret. There is prosciutto and melon, and a selection of cheeses platters to go with white wine, red wine and sweet wine. Or get the charcuterie platter (a selection of 30gm venison hunter ham, 30gm truffle salami, 30gm pancetta, 30gm pork lonzino and 30gm chicken liver pate with olives served with toasted baguettes
