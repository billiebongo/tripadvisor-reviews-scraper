Have be patronizing this restaurant for years. Food remains good and service remains barely there. But will still go back!

One of the best indonesian food ever taken. Price abit steep, but i’d pay for it. Dishes i’d recommend are tau hu , fried springroll
4
Delicious Indonesian fare at reasonable price in downtown financial district. Spicy sweet and absolutely delightful fare that touches the soul

Went to this place for dinner with my friends and all dishes are super delicious! Will definitely go back again!

It was good but not mind blowing. One of the best Indonesian food u can find in singapore. Will return

Was introduced by a friend few years back to visit for indonesian cuisine and ever since the first visit with my family this place has become our frequent choice. The food is delicious and there is a wide range of varieties. We love the tahu telor, ayam gulai, ayam bali, ikan otah & ikan assam pedas. The avacado juice with gula melaka is a must have for me. gotta visit this place for indonesian food. cheers

Well to be fair, to go for their ala carte, the food is delicious that will want to come back for more. Recently they offered buffet for weekdays dinner, decided to go ahead and try. The food is good, however, few of the items are not available, they told us fish were not available and every fish items are not available, another chicken item is also unavailable. They really could have been more professional to inform the customers upfront when they knew that these items are unavailable and let the customers decide if we will still pursuit with buffet or ala carte.To add on, the service were bad, item will always be left out in our order. Did not even ask any last order and send us the bill

Great Indonesian food. The belancan chili is spicy but nice. Fragrance rice wrap in banana leaf. Asam fish can be a soup dish too
4
Been here a few years ago, the standard is still the same. The presentation is good and good quality is just above average. Not as authentic in taste but good enough to enjoy. Otak fish 4 stars Bali chicken 4 stars Morning glory 4 stars Oxtail soup 3 stars Garlic Prawns 3 starsCendol 3 stars Overall not bad and probably one of the best in the area.
4
we came here cos we had an eatigo discount. the tahu telor was seriously good, though the service was rather slow. everything else was pretty average. i believe they have since renovated, so the ambience should be better now too. i'll be back for the tahu telor!
4
the sambal is lovely and it comes with Belinjo crackers. However, i need to portion of rice for the small portion. the rijstaffel concept makes it a great place to share the food.
4
Nice and comfortable restaurant, although seating is a little near between tables. But its nt a issue when there isn't much crowd. Food was served fast and I love the otah fish!
5
Food was good, the low-mild chilli food was just nice for me even though I can't really take spicy food.
Very convenient as well - it was just opposite Telok Ayer train station. Would come back here again.
5
Excellent food! Prawn sambal was delicious and I loved the rice wrapped in banana leaves. The sweet drink is highly recommended. All in all, a pleasant surprise for our first meal here in SG!
5
pagi sore never dissapoints. delicious food as usual. just a tad more expensive then other restaurants, but worth that indulgence once in a while.
5
Walked in for lunch. Love the chicken bali and fish otah. But the dessert avacado shake was way too sweet, think they put too much sugar, we did not manage to finish it. Sambal was too little and if ask for extra it will be chargeable but the price is reasonable. Good service experience, welcomed by an outstanding young lady staff upon arrival and she was very attentive although it was quite crowd busy lunch tim

We went for fri night dinner with 5 friends. Service was great. Atmosphere was pretty good. Food was very tasty. It seemed authentic and flavour was excellent. I should have researched more because they dont serve alcohol due to Halal I suppose. But this wasnt a deal breaker as food was very good.For $110 to feed 5 adults in a decent restaurant in Singapore is very good value so top marks there.A couple of down sides which are NOT showstoppers: Serving sizes were quite small, ie a main only allowed for a mouthful each for 4 people. Probably it is more reasonable to share 1 main between 2 people. However, after the tofu tower for entre, a grilled chicken and curry fish main all 5 of us were pretty full. It just looked very small when each item arrived.Also we ordered 3 rice between 5 people, however they still brought 5 rices out. One of which I sent back. No tap water being served, the annoying rip off trick being used far too much in Singapore. annoying but not a deal breaker. I was expecting this after reading other posts. Bring your own bottle water if you want + hip flask, for full BYO package ;)All in all it is recommended, just bring your hip flask

If you want to experience a busy, loud and authentic Indonesian restaurant then this is the place for you. I went there for lunch with some local colleagues and squeezed into a space towards the back of the restaurant which seemed to be packed with local office workers - mainly female. I left all the ordering to the local experts. Apparently we had exotically named dishes such as Tahu telor, Ayam Gulai, Udang Asam Pedas. To be honest I didn't really care for the chicken dish - I have never been one for fighting to extract the meat from bones, sinews and gristle. I did like the Chendal for dessert and the coconut milk served directly from the shell. Whether I would return is debatable. The place was too busy to allow for a relaxing lunch and environment to talk. And, although I love Indonesian food, I wasn't so convinced about the culinary delights on offer here

Pagi Sore is an old Favourite of mine although I have not been there a while - so many new restaurants to choose from. H/ever we went recently as requested by my family visiting from overseas. We had the set for 6 pax and it was more than enough for the 7 of us. The eggplant was the tastiest dish of the evening, the beef rendang and otah had always been a hit. The rest of the food I felt were not up to their usual standard.  The set included lime/lemon grass drink and dessert of avoid avocado/chendol. Avocado with Gula Melaka was too sweet n I didn't get the taste of the avocado. 2 of my guests requested for warm water and we were charged $1.50 per glass !!! Don't think I will go back there after all there are so many restaurants in Singapore I have not tried yet.

We had dinner on New Year's Day. The restaurant was full of early diners at 7pm and the staff were very busy. Since there were only three or four of them on the floor, they really tried to be attentive and efficient. We ordered the Set Menu for 3-4 pax, and enjoyed every dish we had. The Ayam Bali and Fish Otak-Otak were yummy, and the Tahu Telor was a hit. The staff were very apologetic as they had run out of Chendol and were about to run out of Apulkat. I think that was the only negative bit about the meal; we wish they had some Chendol for our table
4
Delicious food, sampled squid, beef rendang, chicken bbq. Very enjoyable, not too expensive. Only let down which wad a minor point was that the beef was not as tender as I expected.
5
All the dishes we ordered were good. Highly recommend this restaurant.
Service was prompt and friendly staff.
4
Great Indonesian food, ordered the signature Tahu Telor, Ayam Bali etc. Only problem was the crowded seating, a bit squeezy and too noisy.
4
Tasty genuine Indonesian food in a handy location at a good price. Polite wait staff and food delivered fast. Go there it's good!
5
A rainy night kept the crowds down when we visited Pagi Sore for dinner. The restaurant was not very full, but we were still seated at a table right next to other diners. This proved to not be a problem, was just different. We ordered the set meal for 6. Food arrived quickly. was nice and hot, and was delicious. The staff was adequately attentive and friendly
3
Been to this place on other occasion for dinner and food was good, especially the avocado drink and beef rendang. This time's lunch set was somewhat disappointing. The fish otak was totally not otak at all, its so mushy, though the chunk of fish is visible. The beef rending was not tender like previous visit. Potato in the chicken curry was not properly cooked in the middle. Only one that didn't disappoint was the tau hu goreng, standard maintained, same for the avocado drink

We were there for lunch on a weekday. No appointment. Walk in at 12:30 pm and there were still quite a lot of tables available.The waiter tried his best to get us to order their set menu for 3-4 persons. After seeing the price tag of S$100, we decided not to. We ordered a chicken, a vegetable, a tahu telor, and steamed banana leaf rice, plus a drink and 2 desserts. Total bill came up to be about S$20 per pax. Imagine the excess we would have wasted if we ordered the set.Food wise, the chicken was good, not very salty. The vegetable was good, looked very green and fresh but not spicy enough. The Tahu Telor which is fried eggs with beancurd was above average.My friend who wanted to have lunch at Pagi Sore, was aware that Pagi Sore has a charge for the sambal belachan. However, she was under the impression that those on the table are free and Pagi Sore only charged for the additional sambal belachan requested by patrons.Turns out, the charge of S$0.30 was also applied to sambal belachan already on the table. Why am I unhappy with the S$0.60 charge?1) sambal belachan is a staple for Indonesian cuisine. Imagine ordering satay and paying for peanut sauce, or ordering chicken rice and paying for ginger sauce. This is worst than those restaurants which charge you for wet tissues as you could take those wet tissue away with you if not used.2) The sambal belachan were already on the table before we were seated! I wonder what time did they set the tables for lunch.They also charged S$1.60 for free flow of the (banana leaf?) steam rice. But I don't find the rice tasty enough for a refill. The rice is over-steamed.My friend who had the Chendol commended our foresight for not ordering the Chendol
4
Enjoyed dinner here Friday night. The restaurant was quite busy already. We had Beef Rendang, Chilli Kangkong (?) greens and the signature rice steamed in a banana leaf. All were fresh and tasty and arrived quite quickly. They were described as hot but were safe for westerners. Would go back to try other dishes.
4
My wife and I had to attend a course over the weekend and we went to lunch on a Saturday. Unlike the weekdays where this place can get really crowded, the weekends are a lot quieter but the food still tastes as good (and this original place is definitely better than the outlet at 100AM). The rice in the banana leaf, the fried fish and the curry is excellent. Will look forward to this place again next Saturday

For an upscale exterior and bordering-on-snooty service, the interior looked like a weird cafetaria, no real private tables. This was lunch. In the heart of Singapore's financial district. There were special set menus but only for groups of 4 or larger. No set lunch for the solo office worker? Or for 2 people ? Strange indeed if you want to draw the office crowd for lunch. I do not mind paying top dollar for good value, this was not it. I ordered my test dish which is the signature dish for Indonesian cuisine, Beef rendang. And also the Kangkong greens with salted bean, I forget the Malay name. Both were a disappointment. For the high prices, the beef rendang should have been tender, slow cooked, good quality meat. Unfortunately it was tough, poor portions, not close to any of the truly great ones I have had. And the kangkong greens were not well cut into manageable length, someone goofing off in the kitchen seriously. The only food items that were up to par were the keropok and sambal paste. Very sorry to say this, I rarely am moved to write a negative review. But the tipping point came when a lady member of the staff interrupted my meal half way and asked me to pay the bill. Albeit she asked me politely. I was equally polite in responding that I certainly would do no such thing, told her she would have to wait until I finished my meal. It was $25 and for just one person, me, and this was lunch, not dinner. Very poor value. Would never go back, and would not recommend to anyone. Pity, there are many really fine Indonesian restaurants, all over the world. The one I frequent in San Francisco is less expensive and has way better food. Pagi Sore has this incredibly promising exterior appearance that beckons you in, if you are a fan of Indonesian food as I am. The true inside experience was a huge disappointment
1
Probably the SLOWEST halal restaurant I have ever experienced in my 20years travelling to Singapore! Had to wait over an hour for the food to be serve! Should be rename to Malam Sore.
4
Another lunch out in Singapore and Indonesian it was this time. Ordered the kambing(goat) terong(brinjal) and Bali chicken...all three were amazingly good. Only thing I didn't like was tat they put two bowls of krupuk with sambal on the table which I thought was complementary but they charge you for it whether you eat it or not. Lovely ambience and not too steep.
5
We visited this restaurant just after checking in to the AMOY hotel late in the evening. It was packed and so we came back next day at 6 p.m. to find it empty. Service of course was excellent at this time but so was the food. My wife had beef rendang while I ordered butter prawns (Udang Mentega) We shared a taste of each meal and they were absolutely superb. My prawns would rate as one of the best meals I have had on many visits to Singapore. It's a non alcoholic restaurant however the iced drinks were a great compliment We all dine here again
5
Haven't try their food, but smells nice alreadyI'd like to compliment their service thoughWhile I was still waiting for the take away food I ordered, the waiter gestured me to sit, then a while later served me iced water. They didn't even charge me service charge for this. HahaIf the food is awesome, I'll definitely be back!! Excellent service can't go wrong!
3
Came here for a business lunch. It was crowded. Ordered fried squid, tahu telur, kangkong belachan, mushroom, marinated chicken and wrapped steamed rice for 4. Not the best Indonesian restaurant that I personally had been to. Quick to go. Wished they remove the chinese new year decorations to give it an authentic Indonesian ambience
4
Havent been back to pagi sore for a few years. Ordered the tahu telur, rendang sapi, ayam gulai, ikan otah and ikan goreng balado. Food was above average but not as nice as i remembered. During chinese new year period, you can order yusheng in advance as well.
5
Love the ambiance, the service and the food!! Yumm!!! Had ayam bali, ikan otah kukus, tahu telor, rendang and kangkung belachan. They all tasted great! We also had fresh soursop which was sooo good!! Have to applaud them for removing all the seeds! Had an awesome experience and will definitely recommend this place to those who wanna try indo food

Standards have seriously dropped. The food was overpriced, and they even charged for their sambal. that was a shock...The food was nothing to shout about and portions were small - for that price we were expecting a lot more. fish was not fresh, grilled chicken came out cold, oxtail soup tasted like MSG.We used to have department meals there, but can see why we've stopped going
1
Cooks seem inexperience. Dishes weren't cooked properly. The crackers which they charged you for were stale and not crispy. Fish wasn't fresh and was too hard as if kept in the freezer for too long.Waiter also refused to serve guests tap water and couldn't offer a reason why they wanted to charge $1.50 for a glass of tap water? They even charge for sambal chilli. Greedy owner, bad food, poor service - a ridiculous place. There are much better Indonesia restaurants around e.g. Tambuah Ma
2
There are several good Indonesian restaurants in town, but this is one experience to forget. We last visited this restaurant several years ago and had good recollections, but sadly we could not relive any of them. When we arrived, the staff appeared to have no recollection of our table reservation and shuffled us to a remote corner. Service was mechanical and rushed - we felt like we were eating in a cafeteria. The food was completely unexceptional - the fish in the otak was undercooked and had to be sent back (no apology), the mutton gulai had more potatoes than meat, the oxtail soup lacked taste, the tahu telor was sweet and chewy ... the list goes on. Water and extra chilli were chargeable. There were an additional item in the bill which we did not order (again no apologies). Perhaps the restaurant was having a bad night but overall customers deserve much better
4
Excellent food ! I recommend
1. The crackers with sambal
2. Fish - ikan bakar
3. Prawns with cereal and chilli
4. BBQ chicken
5. Avocado dessert
4
Had a company event & made reservation with Mr Paul. We had set dinner. The food was delicious & good. All of us enjoyed the food very much.The staff are friendly. Thanks to Mr Paul & the team for the job well done!!
3
We ordered the set Taohu Telok , Otah and to our surprised the Otah is sour.The staff was reluctant to find out the problem but we ended up with a discount. The food is quite ok and the space is very cramp. Maybe a one time issue but will give it a try agai
4
Very nice Indonesian food in the CBD area of Singapore. A tad expensive, not for daily dining. But we loved whatever we tried- right from Steamed rice to Chicken, Lamb, Prawn curries (Gulai) and also the Tofu/ Egg starter. Must visit. Lunch for 3 excluding Alcohol cost us SGD 90 (all-in)
4
The restaurant has 2 branches, 1 at Telok Ayer and the other is at 100AM. We tend to go during the weekends so the crowd is manageable for the restaurant. When it gets too busy their service level gets low and they tend to make mistakes (applies for both restaurants). Best if you can call in for reservation. Pagi Sore is one of the two Indonesian restaurant we visit regularly. Pagi Sore has great steamed rice wrapped in banana leaves but their popular dishes were misses for us. We usually would order: Ikan Balado, petai sambal and sop buntut. These along with the desserts of chendol or avocado are usually filling for 2 adults 1 child. I do have to mention that the spice level is so so. We will keep coming back to this place as we usually would crave for the ikan balado.
3
If you're keen on oily Indonesian food, this is a good place with quite an extensive menu and OK execution. Even the spiciest dishes are not that spicy, so if you want more heat, you'll need to add sambal chili. Service can be quite haphazard - have to ask for things several times, (at a neighbouring table) chef (or waiter?) forgot and put shrimp paste in vegetarian dish, wrong bill at check out, etc
4
In a traditional shophouse, this is the original shop with a bigger menu and offers a better dining experience than their new branch in the 100AM shopping mall which is rather open and casual, more for the lunchtime crowd. Their dishes are all delicious and go very with their banana leaf rice, a must try. Best of all - their special chili paste which is my favourite in town
3
Their chili with lime taste perfect combined with either belinjo cracker or any other dishes.We like their rice steamed in banana leaves We order Udang Mentega (cereal butter prawn), Cumi Goreng Tepung (deep fried squid) and Ayam Bali (chickencooked in balinese style)We like the dishes. A bit expensive but value for money as taste nice and good servic
5
I am been visiting Pagi Sore for a very long time and have been having the same set of dishes and it has never fail to impress me. So what do i eat and recommend: Ayam Bali, Thau Telor (Tofu dish a must try never get like this anywhere else), Fried Fish with Chile paste, rice, greens, hot steaming rice and yes top it off with Avocado juice! Just love them and will visit again to try the same thing again. It's not that an expensive place for the kind of food it serve but the service during peak hours will be extremely slow so account for it
3
This place serves decent Indonesian food and is located very close to the main CBD area (short walk from raffles place). This places gets extremely busy over lunchtime so if you plan to come suggest you book ahead. My favorite food here is actually the keropak (chips) that they serve together with chilli before the meal. As it gets very busy here expect to wait for service for awhile. Suggest you order for the group and share - otah fish, ayam bali (bbq chicken) some vegetables and been curd. The downside is the lack of extra chilli (only the small portion they serve with the chips and that there is no alcohol here (not even beer)
4
Stopped in here for lunch while on a business trip. Really good! Had some curry of some kind, I believe, and the quality was great. Service was quick and attentive.
5
For those who want to have an Indonesian food, do come here. But i would recommend to go for dinner instead of lunch as it could get really busy during lunch hour. The food is tasty.
1
Was recommended by indonesian friend but was disappointed by the food. Waitress insist that their set for 3 was a great deal but it taste horrible . Not worth to pay $100 over for it.Will not go back
5
It's my favorite restaurant. My favorite dish is the otah fish and petai. You can order others like kangkong, Tahu telur, sotong chili etc. the rice are serve individually wrap in banana leafs which is really good and fragrant. My favorite desert with be the avocado with hula Melaka and cendol. Must go!!
5
I'm surprised I haven't been here before. The food is excellent, location is convenient, and it won't break your bank! We had beef rending, grilled chicken, friend tofu with eggs, vegetables, prawns and calamari. Every single dish was good, and everyone liked everything (we were a large group). We even ordered seconds for some. Will definitely return. 
4
Service with a smile. The food presentation was great. Taste of all our dishes was very good and good quality. Steamed fish was a favourite at our table. Chendol one of the best I've had. Had dinner and the restaurant was quite desserted, however it did not impact on the service quality. Very relaxed and definitely a place to take the family
5
This place is busy at lunch, a popular place for the young professional crowd. Make sure to try their herbed jasmine rice steamed in banana leaves! We had chicken tikka masala and beef curry. Both were delicious. Don't expect to have your server hang around you while you decide what you want. They are running back and forth to take care of all the customers. But the servers were nice in spite of it all
1
Went there for a team lunch celebration but totally ruined due to the very rude waiter they had. It started with bad avocado juice, I asked my female colleague to get the waiter behind her for some gula Melaka. He did not hear my colleague was calling him, so my colleague tapped his hand.The waiter turned around and scolded her " we can talk but you cant touch ". My colleague apologized and we thought it was over. Then, one of our orders never come, my other colleague spoke to the same waiter and told him that we're missing 1 dish, so if it's not cooked yet, we'd like to cancel. He immediately raised his voice and said "did you order from me ?" followed by his aggressive gesture, provoking my female colleague as well as my other colleague. He shouted at us" You have problem, is it ? If you're not happy, you could call a police". He also tried to approach my 2 colleagues violently, as if he wanted to punch people - that other waiters/waitresses had to hold him back. Other customers around our table witnessed the incident. It was a nightmare for us ! We paid an expensive price for an awfully tasted food and totally ruined by an aggressive and violent waiter. It's really a horror! Especially after we found out that he just came out from prison. No offense, we're yellow ribbon supporters. However, this experience really gave me a nightmare. We realized later on that the Service Charge was included in our bill, too ! Before you decided to visit this place, please ask yourself this question : " Is it worth to spend my money in exchange for a horrific service and an awful food experience ?"DISASTROUS !!
1
Had a terrible experience at this restaurant today during lunch. Its my first and last time there. I'm SHOCKED with the service there, especially from the so called 'Supervisor'. As he was facing his back towards us and we were calling him for service, but because he did not answer us, so I just tapped his arm and said, "Excuse me, can we have some more gula melaka, please". He turned to me and answered very rudely, "Next time can you don't touch me"! So I apologized and said I did not know he does not allow anyone to even tap his arm. And then we waited for another order and it was still not served, so we called him and asked him to check if the food was ready, and his raise his voice by saying, "You order from me". So we answered to him and informed him to just check the food if it was ready. Then again from a distance he shouted and threatened us by saying, "You not happy with me is it, call the police lah". I'm a Singapore and a Muslim"! So I asked him what's his problem and he walked up towards me, threatening me and practically asking for a fight! Can you imagine I'm a woman and he is provoking me to fight! Then the 'owner' came in and instead of helping to solve the problem, he just apologized and his explanations to us was he will need to check with his 'Supervisor' staff and see what really happen! I mean I as a customer with witnesses around and s telling him what has happened and that's all he can say! I highly recommend NOT to go there! Terrible service from such an expensive restaurant
2
Went there after office with my family. Not a busy time (2 other table) but service is slow. Food is expensive in a sense that for 15 dollars you get Sop Buntut with four minuscule pieces of bony meat that is not even tender, topped with krupuk. Soup was not even warm! Really small servings for other viands. I even raised this issue when I settled my bill and the cashier said it's a management standard. I have eaten in other Indonesian restaurants before and I had better meals. So much better. Not returning
4
I took a group of colleagues here for lunch, they really enjoyed it. Although it's a little expensive the set menu was a great way for everyone to try a number of different dishes and they all enjoyed it.
5
The food quality was Excellent for Indonesian Food in Singapore. all staff are Excellent service.if i'm visit agent Singapore. i visit PAGI SORE for Excellent food and Excellent Service. Love u all Team Pagi Sore mwuuuaahhh.....
3
Food quality was good for Indonesian food in Singapore, too bad its too overpriced and its service can be improved.
4
at pagi sore i had always a good Indonesian meal in Singapore. friendly staff, nice food and good value for money. try their Beef Rendang which is really nice and full of flavour!
3
Quite often come here for indonesian food..I like eating their melinjo crackers with sambal belacan while waiting our food to be served..Their rice steamed in banana leaves so quite special and very fragrant..We normally order Ayam Bali, Tahu telor and Udang Pedas. Sometimes order kangkong belacan also.Not really like order dessert since last time ever order chendol once and taste so so..Their juices is not nice like their green apple is yes fresh. but really sour.. asking for sugar they give us sachet sugar. Their staff less thoughtful, how can the sachet sugar diluted into cold apple juice.. So, we just think enough.. another visit just order bottled water.
2
Don't expect a glass of "normal" water here. They only serve mineral water. Really! I thought we could drink water from any tap in SingaporeThe sambal was awesome but an additional teaspoon with a lemon in a bowl came for 30c. The staff "kindly" let us know, you will "have" to pay extra 30c. Fortunately she didn't utter BEWARE- Ikan Otah was LESS than average. How did they manage to make the sauce so bland!- I shall not think about Okra for a long time while sitting in any restaurant lest I am served something similar.- The Tahu telok was nicely presented but it tastes better in the small store across our office - Personally I like chendol without red beans - Ayam Bali portions were very small. It was sweet and smoky but quite dry - The rice was good and fragrantSo go there for rice and Sambal
4
Nice food, good portions and good service. They meal was served quickly and the staff were very helpful with recommendations. Their chilie is excellent, and I loved the grilled chicken set meal. Good for sharing with a crowd as they have promotions / set meals for 4, 6, 8, 10 pax.Reasonable pricing considering location and quality - would gladly retur
2
Didn't live up to our expectations or its reputation. Rice wasn't served in banana leaf as described on menu, and just about passable. Ordered the signature fish dish. Not available. Fish stew we ordered as the alternative was tasty. Chicken bali OK, not special. Waiting staff slow and clearly wanted to be somewhere else. $4 for a bottle of water. Worse thing was the temperature in the restaurant. Wow, we were uncomfortably cold. And the food went cold very quickly. Altogether, very disappointing
3
I would have expected more from this restaurant perhaps due to some extra efforts in its Indonesian decoration; however, we visited on the Indonesian Independence Day on 17 August and not a single Indonesian flag was on display ! I should have known then, instead of switching to Bahasa Indonesia when our waitress seemed not comprehending the English words- no, she did not understand Indonesian. The Indonesian theme is only at the food and decorations with the batik uniforms, not even the instrumental back ground music was Indonesian.The first thing that we noted on the menu was lots of "Not available" stickers- then on the white board to the kitchen there are a long list of more not available for today- one of those were Ice lemon tea, Ayam Gulai, Petai etc.Gulai Kambing came first in a small dish- it was good for $12. Eggplant taochou was tasty, although Ayam Kalasan was rather bland, Ayam Bali average, and Kangkung Balacan was average. Avocado Ice seems the favourite and indeed it was good , so as the Es Chendol ( $5.50 ). Rice served wrapped in a banana leave was a plus.There are other Indonesian places serving better dishes ( although some perhaps missing the decorations bit). I will not return to this restaurant unless I am in a neighbourhood and hungry for Indonesian dishes
4
Pagi Sore was recommended to me by a colleague and I was very glad to have taken their advice to dine there. The restaurant is tucked away in a side street between Chinatown and the financial district. We ordered a wide selection of items from the menu to share as a group which included vegetarian, chicken, beef and seafood dishes. The Beef Rendang proved to be a favourite, but all the dishes were perfectly spiced and beautifully cooked. The service was a little slow and we found it hard to attract the attention of the waiters to refresh our drinks and bring us the bill. The restaurant has good atmosphere and I would be happy to bring friends visiting me in Singapore here again
