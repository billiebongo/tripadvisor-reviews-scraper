Ordered the $5 plate of Hokkien Mee. Served piping hot.
Ingredients are fresh, waiting time at average of 10 mins.
Considered the best Hokkien Prawn Mee I've had over Singapore (Around 15 stores)
Highly Recommended!

I have been eating this for almost 2 decades and the last visit was a shade off its best.
The noodle seemed not to have absorbed the stock and it tasted limpid.
Hopefully it's a one-off, otherwise a great dish.

Those that come Singapore but didn't come here.Oh well don't say u tried the local food.Ok put this simple, this is the only dishes u can't get in anywhere else of the world.Y? simple, chicken rice, laksa, pork ribs etc can be found in Malaysia, let alone some Singapore restaurant in even western countries. But no, for this dishes as it favours came from the combination of stir fried and braising method of Chinese cooking. Sadly it requirement are so stringent it is hard for any one to bring it oversea. So yea this is a must try

I have eating this stall for over 15 years and of recent years, I noticed the inconsistency of their hokkien mee. It seemed that they are frying in larger qty and much faster. Previously, you could taste the "wok-hei" but now it is just quick and plain. My confidence is deteriorating and would not patronize anytime soon.

They use to occupy only one stall, but now due to increase in business and faster service, with 2 large woks dishing out the yummy noddles, they also took in the vacant store next to it. By far they have the longest queue in the whole good centre. Eat the noodles while it is hot, with the chilli and a squeeze of lime.

There are many Hokkien mee stalls but this is the best, and they deserve their Makansutra and other certificates. They cook pretty fast, as there are long queues at peak periods. Eat with the chilli, which accentuates the texture. When less busy, u can even request to add an egg but it costs $1, so may not be worthwhil

Hokkien Char Mee is one Singaporean dish that I badly crave for... and it's usually the first thing I try to feast on after landing at Changi. Unfortunately my greed causes me to experience some pretty poor versions... and regret. For years, Soon Hock Hokkien Mee at Block 23 Sin Ming Road served as my benchmark. When I reminisce about Soon Hock, I can almost taste the perfectly stir-fried Hokkien noodles, bee hoon, bean sprouts, a handful of prawns and slivers of calamari in a super rich gravy made from pork and prawns. Fried with lard... that makes all the difference, in my opinion. Singapore Fried Hokkien Mee at Whampoa comes very close to the taste of Soon Hock, and is obviously very popular judging from the long queue. Super yummm

Most Singaporeans will know this place. For visitors they should definitely want to give this a try. Unlike Penang style Hokkien Mee which is available at many places in US & Canada, we could not find Singapore style Hokkien Mee anywhere in North American. The savory shrimp stock that they used to wet the noodle gives it the distinct flavor. The perfect proportional mixed of mee, bee hoon and bean sprout, gives its unique "texture". If you like it spicy, the home made red chilli paste is wonderful when mixed with freshly squeezed lime juice. I gave it less than perfect score because it is not as good as before. I remembered that it was better when the "old man" was doing the stir frying
