Lacking in varieties of food, salad bar miserably only 2 types of vege. most of the cooked dishes are very salty. Dessert are also very limited . Not worth the value.

The Lobster and Crab buffet is one of the best I have eaten, unlimited servings of the crustaceans. Crabs were done three different ways, downside is lobster were done in only one style grilled with cheese. After eating a few lobster the cheese get to you, they should have it done natural also. There are also local delicacy like oyster omeletter, Bak Kut Teh, Satay and many more

The service staff were attentive and manage to clear the table clean even in the peak hour. Unlike some places during the peak hour u can still see the plates or even pill up. The manger do a nice job on manning the team. Thumb up.

Went for lunch. No oysters n no sashimi. The crab n smoked salmon was quite nice tho. The restaurant was quite empty on a Thursday afternoon. There was quite a few selection of desserts. Nice coffee machine and Dilmah teabags were also available.Can try again

I had an enquiry regarding the food, generally PARKROYAL as well as the restaurant itself had staffs that were very helpful. Especially manager Zhieshen from the restaurant whom was polite and suggested a resolution towards my enquiry. Going the extra mile to satisfy customers, overall I compliment their good customer servic

The decor is average, nothing really fancy.The staff is friendly and helpful.The variety of foods is impressive. On the night I went, there was even lobster. The lobster was overcooked but flavorful. There were other seafood dishes and some international fare. There was also Peranakan-styled foods and a few Indian dishes. There was both Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab. The crabs were good and good-sized. Drinks were coffee and tea, self-served from a machine.Desserts were simple and the range limited but the ice cream was really good
