They served authentic Korean food! My second visit so far! Great chill out place. Not smelly. Nice marinated meat. They have 9 side dishes too!

I patronize this place at least once a week.
Friendly service, delicious food served steaming hot.
Recommended the Ginseng Chicken and fried dishes.
Worth visiting.

food isn't the most outstanding there is, but the service does make up for everything!! this was my second visit and i dined arlund 2.30 p.m., after peak hour. The waiter was very attentive to swiftly replenish our side dishes once it ran out. The imo is also very friendly :")
