Overall experience was perfect - the food, drinks, ambiance and the service. The place was immaculate, with extensive menu and interesting cocktails. Would definitely return to Lucha Loco again with my friends!
5
Had a nice supper here. A few dishes with jugs of cocktails.
The grilled stuffed peppers are excellent.
Gauc and pineapple salsa not so great.
Tacos are nice and the crab tostaditas are tasty. You will want more!

Came here for lunch today and tried a selection of the tacos. These were very tasty but a little on the small side. Nice location, good ambience and efficient service.

The staff was impatient with our seating arrangement and did'nt seem to care much about our comfort. I especially disliked how they disregarded our request to be seated / moved to a specific area of the restaurant. The staff seemed cold and disinterested. A couple of them angry too ! The nachos was average and the margaritas light ! Don't bother going to this place
4
A great place to be outside when the weather is cool. Tucked away at the corner, nice and quiet. Service is good and prompt. Food however is not something one would remember much. We had the vegetarian quesadilla and the grain bowl to share. They were okay, not to write about. The brownie we had was a bit dry and the flavour was average.I would come back for drinks but not for food.
5
My partner and I loved Lucia Loco! We shared a few entrees and each had a taco. The food was amazing and the drinks were excellent. We sat outside in the garden area which was very charming with good atmosphere and music. The waiters were also very friendly and ours was particularly funny so we enjoyed a few laughs. The surrounding neighbourhood is very cute and if you wanted you are only a short walk away from Chinatown.

Great place to go after cocktails for a ladies night out. They have so many different types of tacos - btw all freshly made! Would recommend the sweet potato and chicken. My friends ordered the tortillas - yum. Washed it down with sangria or red wine. Happy evening!
2
The area is a fun place to visit with plenty of bars and places to eat. Lucha Loco is a popular Mexican and the staff are lovely but the food....Umm! Basic is probably the best way to describe it. We had a number of different dishes between us and nothing stood out. In short - If the food was half as good as the team who serve it we would be regulars. Unfortunately itâ€™s not.
5
We had dinner in this restaurant and the food was amazing. The tacos are small in size but taste good. The frozen pineapple margaritas were gorgeous and went down very easily.The restaurant can be busy in the evening time for dinner so be prepared as you may need to wait at the bar
5
Selected this place to celebrate wife's birthday and was right in the choice.Made a reservation to play safe and was highly impressed with the ambiance which is so lively due to the right music being played.Good service and excellent food and drinks specially the Margaritas (AMAZING)Would rate it 9.5 out of 10 for overall experience......
3
Had pre-dinner drinks here. Nice outdoor seating area and good margaritas. Really like the wrestling themes. Only issue is the staff are a bit too attentive and kept pushing for more orders. Spoilt the evening a bit.
5
The restaurant itself is really really cute and the food is awesome. They also have good beer on their happy hours promotion in the evening too. The Guacamole is a little sour but so far the food is perfect and great service
5
Glad that we chose to sit outdoors instead which had lovely lights and ambience around. The service crew were excellent! Food was delicious, love their margaritas! Great place for a date and friends gathering!
5
This is our "go to" family restaurant in Singapore. The waiting staff are great, especially Aelfira, the outside seating is lovely and the food, especially the tostaditas, is delicious.
1
Food is just bad, meat was dry and without flavour..is really difficult find Mexican food as bad as lucha loco....and very expensive!!
4
Visited this lively restaurant with friends. Chose a table in the garden area but under the extendable canopy (just in case it rained which it did very briefly). Very attentive, friendly and enthusiastic staff. Took our drink order first - a fantastic range or margaritas- the blood orange and guava one was our favourite. Chipa salsa and delicious home made guacamole to start. Then onto some amazing tacos - ordered a couple each to try with the option to order more later depending on appetite. Baja Fish, Chorizo com Res Tea and Carnitas were our top favourites but others equally tasty. Nice Singapore spicy hear added to these Mexican dishes. No room for dessert.Not cheap but well priced considering we had alcoholic drinks
5
To carry off a Mexican theme so far from Mexico is a big achievement and Lucia Loco does it brilliantly. Not since Wahaca first opened in London have I tasted such fresh lively ingredients. The outdoor area with the fairy lights is magical and combined with a balmy Singapore evening and a few excellent cocktails (El Megroni) it makes for a very special night, congratulations
4
lively outdoor setting with wooden communal tables for larger groups and smaller ones for couples. We ordered margaritas - bloody orange & guava (7/10) and tamarind (8/10). Had a tuna tostada and mango ceviche for starters. Tostada was good, ceviche was overly tangy for my taste.Star of the day was the Baja Fish Taco, we liked it so much that we had a second helping. Its a much recommended taco. Saw people ordering corn cob which looked delicious as well.This is a solid mexican option in Singapore
4
My friend said we must go and take a look at Singapore Lan Kwai Fong (hong kong). Like everything else it was walking distance. Agree a bit uphill like in HK but comparison stops here. We came into the street and the guy fm Lucha Loco stood outside and described all places along the street for us. Fantastic, not to sell his own place but to help us to find our best choice for the evening. We looked for drinks only he suggested their outside garden, we have no reason to regret. Wonderful garden to sit on a hot evening. Staff where caring and attentive. We simple had a nice stay for our drinks. Place is actually a Mexican can't say anything about the food, but got her to hand out and chill down for some drinks.
5
We came here on a Saturday night and we left wanting more time to enjoy everything they offered. The group of us has the set menu of 5 different plates. Our waiter Reggie was amazing. He kept coming over and making sure that everything was fine and that we were enjoying our meals and drinks. Next time we are in Singapore, we will be coming here again for sure
5
Best mexican food I have had in a very long time. The vibe is really cool and the waiters are so sweet and welcoming. Really worth a visit!!!
5
The food here is amazing and would highly recommend it. We would recommend trying the corn appetizer. Please do not book here expecting cheap mexican food, this is Singapore it is expensive, but definitely worth it!
5
The best Mexican food in town. That salsa is the best i've had in Singapore hands down! If you are a lacto vegetarian looking for that perfect taco, this is the place for it.
5
Real mexican food is hard to find. Then I mean mais tortillas in stead of flour and not the texmex food. At lucha loco we took the 5 course chefs special and it was very good!!! My husband is mexican and even he thought it was lovely! One of the best restaurants in singapore. They also serve really good sangria's and cocktails. In the weekend you can stay after dinner for drinks and the music will be louder
4
With the hot humid weather in Singapore, it's hard to get a bunch of diners to want to sit in the open for their meals. But it's a refreshing sight at Lucha Loco on Duxton Hill, where one could enjoy a glass of wine while enjoying the view of the sunset. The food was good and in bite size portion, the savoury squid with deep fried pork was good, mushrooms and pollo quesadilla a must order. The chipotle chicken wings was roasted to perfection and so was the roasted sweet corn. By the time we finished the mains, our tummy was too full for deserts. Overall a good place for a great catch-up with friends.
2
I'm a international chef who lives in Australia at the moment, Originally from Mexico and after spend a few year in USA and now in OZ I always try to find some time in my trips to visit mexican "authentic" food places! Everything starts ok till the waiter took my order and 40 min later after everyone around was finishing their meals even when I arrived first I decided to leave! Waiters didn't help and hostess was nice but she didn't know how to handle the situation and I could even try the food! Be careful! nice atmosphere, bad service and high prices!
4
Have been to Lucha a number of times, both when I used to visit Singapore and now as a resident. Never fails to disappoint. Great outdoor areas, awesome margaritas and great Mexican fare.Really worth the effort if you are looking for a casual night out. In a good area surrounded by a number of other bars, in case you fancy a cleansing ale before bedtime
4
Best thing about the restaurant: the ambience. Great open air area, with some funky 90s tunes playing on a Friday night. Open till late (well, late for Singapore), and the drinks, though not cheap, were likewise not overpriced.Can be a good spot for a small group of friends, or for post-dinner dates.In a district with mostly tiny shophouse-sized restaurants, the wide, open layout of the place, combined with well thought interior designs, makes Lucha Loco a refreshing sight.Would go back
1
we love Mexican food and we are very pleased to enjoy a good restaurant while travelling around the world.we picked few appetizers: ceviche ( 20 SGD: tasting only of coriander and big slices of onions ); nachos con guacamole ( 5 SGD: ok ); brown rice with gualapenos ( 7 SGD: too too too too much spicy and too much onion slices; no way to feel all the other ingredients ); tacos with squid ( 8 SGD: simply disgusting, can't recognize the seafood inside ); mini tortillas with crab ( 10-15 SGD: ok but we ate them after all the rest, too late to be able to avoid the onion/coriander odors. )in total, adding an orange juice and a bottle of water we spent 86 SGD.Mexico is far away from Lucha Loco
4
A group of us went to Lucha Loco..it has a great atmosphere and the food is fresh and spicy. The drinks menu was varied with lots of choice. The ribs and the pork taco were good. The staff were pacy and overall we enjoyed the night. If you are a BIG eater, this may be a pricey night compared to others! The naco's are not the biggest
4
Located in a cozy neighbourhodd, Lucha Loco delivered good food and prompt service. The chicken wings were excellent as well the frozen margarita. Tacos were average, highs & lows.
5
My friend organised a surprise birthday meal for me. The food was excellent and I had a lovely birthday cake with candles and a sombrero.
4
Loved our overall experience at Lucha Loco, from the trendy outdoor seating area, to the helpful staff and, of course, really tasty menu with interesting flavour combinations. Only downside - quite expensive for what you get.
4
This place is in Tanjong Pagar area filled with the double storey pre-war shop houses. There are many good restaurant around the vicinity.We visited on Friday evening and the restaurant is super busy. Fortunately we have make the booking earlier and managed to get a good seat next to the bar. One of us is Mexican and according to him the food here are street food. However, the serving size is very small. The nacho I ordered is about the size of my iphone 7, and it costs S$7. The Grilled chicken is very good. Nevertheless, the ambience here resemble alley in Mexico with Mexican music playing at the background except in Singapore people do not dance with the music
5
Restaurant located in a very nice and relaxed neighbourhood. It is especially nice if you dine outside on the patio. You can come and have a drink and eat with a large group of friends. We were 10 of us. Excellent tapas and quesadillas, very good frozen Margaritas, and cocktails. Very nice and cool atmosphere
4
We love the atmosphere and the drinks. The service is good and its a great place to come and unwind and just enjoy. The food portions are a little small but order a little of everything. Make sure you book it does get busy over the weekends and if you love Tequila this is the place. Enjoy

A friend has raved about this restaurant for years, so when we were both in Singapore at the same time, I had to try it out. I don't think i've been so disappointed with a restaurant in years. First off, I'm hoping the interior is where the wonderful atmosphere/ambiance that people love is, because sitting outside on a small stool in the dark isn't really that great. It was so poorly lit that I had to use my iPhone flashlight to read the menu and see the food. When the food got there, it was equally as disappointing. We ordered an assortment of things to try. The first to arrive were the chips, salsa, beans and guacamole. They were kind of a sign of things to come. The chips were OK, the beans were good, and the salsa and guacamole were both devoid of flavor. When the "tostaditas" arrived, i laughed. Four tortilla rounds with a spoonful of topping. Then i tried them... The crab was insipid and had no real crab flavor (it was more like eating supermarket "crab" salad). But the chicken was worse. It tasted burnt and when I whipped out my trusty iPhone flashlight, my suspicion was confirmed, as it clearly had been (It didn't have char or grill marks, but had the acrid papery layer that food gets when burnt in the pan). The ceviche could have been good, but it was so unbalanced and acidic that I had to stop eating it. As for the tacos, we tried a few different kinds and the only one that I'd even consider having again was the Baja fish. The others weren't horrible, but they were rather uninspired and boring. For dessert we tried the "De Chocolate." The brownie was OK, the mescal cream was really good, but the sauce that it was served in was horribly grainy and ruined the dish.The biggest shock/disappointment of the evening was when the bill came. Now, I'm not the type to really care about what food costs; if this had been good food or even a better atmosphere or if we'd had drinks (i had one margarita), I'd never have thought twice about the bill. However, with tip, it was nearly $220. There is just no justification for $17 (combined price of the 4) for some chips and dips, $20+ for clumsy ceviche, $16 for 4 tortilla chips no matter the topping (especially when said topping was bad), or $10 for one taco when none of them are really spectacular, special, or even well made.The only aspect of the restaurant that i was really impressed by was the staff. They were friendly, attentive, and quick with their service
4
My friend and I went for dinner here. This is nice little gem located in a nice area. The service is very friendly and attentive.The corn on the cob is amazing. Would recommend this.The prawn taco was nice and had a nice kick along with the baja fish taco.Worth visiting if you fancy some great Mexican food
5
I've been here twice bringing my tourist friends (Australians & other Asians), and they all loved the drinks & unique ambience here. I always request for the armchairs in their delightful garden. Staff are very attentive, heck, we couldn't resist ordering more and more margaritas :)
4
Casual and relaxed but a tad loud with great margaritas and sangria. We took the Chef's Selection - Head Honcho - which was 7 well chosen dishes. We started off with crispy corn chips with salsa and guacamole then super grilled octopus and wild snapper ceviche. The meats - Chicken, beef and pork - were tender and in wonderful natural juices. They were nicely complemented with Mexican rice and ensalada salad. For desserts, we had a selection of pistachio brownie, sweet corn cake and coconut sorbet. Service was prompt and very attentive despite the crowd, even on a Thursday night.
4
Went there by mistake because of the sign they had outside. Menu of tequila is endless. For lovers of tequila make sure you visit it.
3
If you want stay between expat and fashionista, good location. Anyway the coktails are great, ok for the terrace, pricey as everywhere trendy in singapore
4
This restaurant is on top of Duxton Hill and is always busy. The food was very tasty and a nice fusion of Tex-Mex with a Spanish tapa flair. The margaritas were very nice and authentic. All in all, I would recommend, but do expect a crowded environment
3
Visiting Singapore, there are plenty of food options that selecting a place can be overwhelming. Having been a long time since I had Mexican food (good Mexican) I filtered on TripAdvisor and found a good selection. Chose this place as the pictures seemed to show good and somewhat authentic tacos. Was overall impressed by the tacos. I chose two (enough as they were quite full) accompanied by another great Mexican street food, elote. Ok, the tacos were great but the elote needed a lot of work as the corn wasn't fresh and lacked the mayonnaise/cream I had hoped for. Also, the Margaritas on the rocks were nicely done, albeit a little too sweet for my taste. Limited outdoor dining in the front with average size of indoor dining. I would definitely return to get another Mexican fix on this side of the planet, but so many other choices. If looking for tacos, look no further. Just don't expect Mexican street taco pricing ;-). Tacos average 8 sgd each with margaritas at 15. Quickly adds up, but worth the fix.
4
We were there on a Saturday and the place and athmosphere is very good if you are looking for a casual Saturday night with friends. Food is fast (almost too fast) Staff is friendly and the service is absolutely good enough for a place like this
3
Ambiance and setting indoors is OK, staff mixed experience, and food is simply average...there are better Mexican restaurants in Singapore, where the food is more rounded and to perfection.Had some tacos and the chocolate brownie dessert which was unconvincing. For the price would not return there as food was just so so
4
Dinner for 2.Main draw here is the ambience and their tacos. The outdoor area was great on a relatively cool breezy night. The place was packed. The food was good. The tacos were one of the more authentic ones I have tried in Singapore. Not like the usual Tex-mex stuff you find at many other Mexican restaurants. The ceviche was a little disappointing, not enough of the fish and a tad too acidic. I would recommend the Baja fish tacos. The drinks were okay, kinda lacked the punch I was hoping for. Overall a good experience. Only reason why I didn't give full marks for this place was the value for money. It's pretty pricey for tacos and the margaritas can use a little bit more kick.
3
This is a fairly decent restaurant with a few oddities and very average service (seemingly unavoidable these days in Singapore). Outdoors space is pleasant although the tables by the wall are too close to each others.The two most egregious aspects are linked with the no-reservation policy, utterly nonsensical and the little cards on the table (pictured) asking you to leave the table 2 hours after arrival...I frankly cannot understand why a standard reservation system cannot be implemented and the card puts a serious dent in any feeling of being welcomed to the place.Food is fine - not all dishes work, spice levels are very inconsistent and not always right and the coconut ice-cream if flavorless. Cocktails are equally uneven - a margarita tasted fine, the other entirely watered-down. Service is mixed - first drinks order was incorrect, a waiter kept coming asking whether we had already paid despite having paid 10 minutes earlier, etc...This is a decent attempt at a lively and interesting place with some limitations linked to service capabilities and the processes chosen to manage the restaurant
4
Great place to hangout on any day of the week and enjoy some sharing plates with your mates!! Margaritas, Tacos and the corn cobs are all great dishes on offer!! The place is based in Duxton Hill which is surrounded by small little cafes and restaurants
5
Fantastic Mexican food with very friendly staff and great vibe. Prices are a bit on the expensive end, but the environment is so great and food so authentic that it is ok to pay a bit extra for them. A little piece of Mexico in the middle of Singapore - great place
5
Love this place - great for after work drinks and food on a friday night.
The tasting menu is amazing - make sure you come hungry through as the food never stops!
5
We were celebrating our daughter's 18th birthday. This place has great food, great cocktails, ambience and service. A very fun night with the cool set.
5
I've been here with friends and for business and I absolutely love it. The drinks are Amazing and the food is delicious. Definitely get the ceviche. You will also want two tacos! The chorizo is perfect!
4
The perfect place for a Friday night for cocktails beer and great tacos.
There is a nice atmosphere with good music and good vibes for a cool evening.
4
Lucha loco has great margaritas and great food
Staff is helpful. Tacos portions could be a bit bigger but covers up in the taste.
5
Second review of Mexican in Singapore within a week! What what an e pertinence!
Real Mexican, serious stuff. Love it!
One comment (that did not take a star off...) is Huitlacoche. Don't call mushroom Huitlacoche. It's not. Good quesadilla, though.
4
My girlfriend and I spent a charming evening at Lucha Loco and will certainly be returning! We chose a menu option that offered a number of different dishes, each of which is decided for you - making things a little more fun! Overall the atmosphere, service, food, and drinks were all great. The only issue I came across was the choice of seating... I sat both outside and inside (due to the threat of rain) and both were notably uncomfortable. When outside, I couldn't even put my legs under the table! Not quite sure why they've chosen to do this, but I also wouldn't say it stole much from the evening as a whole. Enjoy!
4
This is a great place to go with friends and enjoy the good vibe, awesome food and just to enjoy. they have everything you need try something of everything. The drinks are also something to try in copious amounts. Enjoy the place and remember to book it gets quite full. This is real Mexican so Enjoy
5
Went here at around 6pm on a Tuesday and place was already almost full. Great atmosphere and views back over the city as the sunset.Excellent cocktail list with something for everyone. Food has a range of nibblies, individual tacos and quesadillas and larger things to share. Between 5 of us we had a mix of everything and everything we chose was delicious.Staff were really helpful and there was no feeling that you were being rushed, happy for you to eat and drink at your leisure.Great night out at a reasonable price
4
Went on a Friday night and arrived at 7pm- the place filled very quickly and there are bookings available only for groups. Sat inside and things got a bit loud but not overly so. The service was quick and efficient but we didn't feel we were being rushed out the door, though there is a 2 hour limit Fridays and Saturdays.The food was amazing. Fresh, bright and sooooo different from the horrendous texmex crap I'd had called 'mexican' in the past. The man and I love a 'nibble dinner' and this menu had it covered - lots of little plates for sharing and tasting.Margaritas were delicious but the only options were frozen or on the rocks - both were rapidly and sadly, diluted. The blood orange variation was yum.We stayed longer than our 2 hours and thoroughly enjoyed it. We'll be back - maybe for a looooooooong lunch :
5
Fab evening with friends, great cocktails, amazing food, decent service. The only slight bug bear would be the setting and the seating - not sure why they make it so uncomfortable! Pls note you can't book so you will have to wait at prime times.
4
Been there many times, the kind of place to chill on a friday night! It can easily be very crowded but it's a Nice place to have cocktails!
5
We went here midweek for a family dinner based on a friends recommendation. We were not disappointed. The menu is limited, but the food is excellent and freshly prepared. We had quesadillas, fish tacos, a lovely mango ceviche and an excellent cob of corn covered with a great cheese and chilli combination. Highly recommended.
4
It was an office get-together (almost 20 of us!) after a long day of meeting, and we occupied the long table outside. Lucky the weather was nice and dry. And highly recommended to sit outside.Ambiance was excellent! And yes, the staff were a chatty and energetic bunch.The drinks were spot on but i found the food slightly lacking. I prefer the food at the sister branch (i think) Super Loco though.Nonetheless, it was the company that mattered and i will return again just for the ambiance
5
atmosphere - outdoor was more loud/alfresco type, but me and my friend opted for indoors for a calmer environment.service was quick although we had difficulties choosing from all the little foods on the menu!starter was guacamole and tortilla chips - easy enough to make at home so not bad for the price.mains were the beef and fish tacos - beef; was very tender and grilled with a delicious sauce! fish was also very fresh in taste. having had authentic tacos in central america, these ones were not bad at all!we didn't order any drinks but they seemed pretty tasty too!conclusion - good spot for decent (not THE most authentic mexican maybe) but good for small bites with drinks and tacostacostaco
4
Let me just start by saying that my expectations for Mexican restaurants are probably really high. For Singapore this is a good Mexican restaurant, the quesadillas and tacos taste really well and I really enjoyed the frozen margaritas (not the Lucha margarita that one had no tequila in it). The service started slow,it was 5 de Mayo so they were really busy but later on the waitress paid a lot of attention to our table so she got a generous tip. I asked for sour cream for my quesadilla and they didn't have any. What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't have sour cream? Also my friends realized that we didn't really have any salsas or chilly sauce for our tacos. which is very common in Mexican food. Overall I liked it and I think that its a good restaurant especially in Singapore but is it a GREAT Mexican restaurant? No, there is room for improvement
4
Fun, long outdoor tables in the garden with energetic staff and great snacks. The quesilladas are by far the star of the show but there's a good fresh ceviche and excellent guac too. Cocktails aren't mind blowing but you're there for the Latino vibe and the atmosphere so don't let that stop you
4
Food was yummy! Ordered the Corn & cheese (elotes), braised beef & crab entrees, lamb & tiger prawns tacos, chicken & truffle mushroom quesadillas. Oh not forgetting the cinnamon nacho with white chocolate dessert. Yummy! We kinda over-ordered because we wanted to try everything and the waitress was surprised we ordered so many items for mere 2 pax. We spent $130 (no alcholic drinks, just 1 glass of watermelon & basil juice and Orange n ginger juice)The place is rather crowded, no reservations unless its above group of 6. The waitress mentioned a 2 hour sitting policy for weekends so you can't stay too long there
1
The atmosphere catch up the overall restaurant quality.Food is so so - too spicy.Drinks are overpriced. There is no happy hour.And even if you keep on ordering food and drinks, the staff ask you to leave the table after 2 hours regardless the amount you already spent to give place to next customers who may spend less. Weird business logic..
4
Love the vibe here on a Friday night! We sat outdoors and really enjoyed the food and the setting. Try the corn on the cob (it's delicious!) and the cornbread cake with ice cream for dessert (it's heavenly!). Their cocktails are nice, and I liked my roast cauliflower starter and chicken quesadilla. It's a bit pricey for Mexican food ($11 for a soft tortilla, and you'll need a few of those) but overall I enjoyed it and would go back
4
The octopus and prawn ceviche is a stand out. The beef quesidilla v good. All simple size good prices.
Service ok ambience lovely. Always enjoy.
5
Fabulous food, drinks and atmosphere. Ideal for a friends gathering for an afternoon or evening. Staff are helpful without being over intrusive. Try the cocktails out!
5
Delicious food - Mexican type tapas - and lovely dessert too - we had nachos with chocolate and toffee sauce with ice cream. Great location in happening area with lots of other restaurants and in a beautiful building which was nicely styled - modern and chic
5
This place rocks..inside or out..tequila or not Food is fast tasty and service is awesome.Caped Masked Tequila Bar man hilariousWe were looked after by Al - he was great attentive, good advice on what to order ( we basically had him order us a feast)One of those places you want to go back toNo disappointments here !!! only that I wish I could go back once a wee
3
Trendy place but expensive. The quality of the food is not great and the drinks are overpriced. Shame- as we were looking forward to go there
5
Been here 3 times in the last 3 weeks (not a lie!), love this place. Been twice for dinner and once just for late night drinks... the tacos are amaazzzing, and the steak dish with the cactus...OMG it's a must try. Also a great spot for late night drinks with some cool tunes and a great vibe. *hot tip - Passionfruit Smashito is a MUST!
3
An Singaporean evening with very old friends took me to this interesting place. The drinks are the best choices, very good for any alcohol level from zero. The food is tasty and the menu is is reasonable. The prices are also look reasonable by Singaporean standards, but my views changwhen the very small servings arrived
5
Excellent staff, delicious food and great atmosphere. I highly recommend. Top tip would be to book a table
5
I have visited this joint 3 times accompanied by different groups of people - my guests and I loved the experience on each visit.The place is very lively and we like the overall vibe. Food comes in small portions, reasonably priced, and allows you to sample different things. Soft shell tacos, chicken starters (can't recall the name of the dish) are particular favourite with my guests. On our last visit in Dec2015 (I hosted team dinner), we ordered at least one quantity of every dish (almost) and we were happy with each of them.Drink menu is equally good and we managed to sample each of their margaritas. If you do not fancy Mexican food, you can still visit this place just for the drinks - it is worth it.Staff and their service is fantastic. They seem to genuinely enjoy what they are doing. They were friendly without fawning or being intrusive.I have tried good Mexican food at other places too but this place has good service, food, drinks, ambience and location without being priced over the top. Hence, it deserves 5/5 rating. We will definitely visit again.Note: They do no take reservations for groups smaller than 8 people
4
awesome mexican food, very well presented. i love the cocktail menu! they have outdoor and indoor sittings, but the gardens tables are the best! portions are not too big, tacos are great
4
The place has a good atmosphere, efficient staff and looks to be popular with a younger ex-pat crowd. The cocktails (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) are excellent. The tacos, quesdillias and Mexican rice were good but not world beating. Portions on the small side but reasonably priced.
3
i think this is a great place to grab drinsk with your friends. Great portion sizes and the marghereitas are actually delicious. Not a huge fan of the food itself but as far as ambiance and vibes go, it is absolutely awesome
5
Skikkelig kul sjappe i Chinatown! Gir taco en helt ny mening.
Nice and cool people, very good food and you will order at least 4 drinks!
Nice o rama!
5
Good food, Great drinks and fantastic staff. Had such a good night I left my mobile behind. No problems - got a call soon after confirming they have my phone and returned it. Not many places would have such honesty nowadays.
4
Decent Mexican/Tex-mex. Awesome environment and chilled vibe. Must try the corn, is quite unique. Tacos are excellent and the ceviche was fresh and crisp.
3
We came for a birthday party and had a table of twelve, we felt underserviced and overcharged by the end of the night. The waitress originally offered to keep tabs different but then when it came time for bills we were delivered 3 bills and then it took over 20 minutes to get our cards back. Overall the food was excellent but the management either understaffed the night or we had a newbie who couldn't handle a table that size. I would go again (I wouldn't host another party there) to see if the service is better in a group of four or less
3
For starters, the place is a pure gem. Perched on top of Duxton Hill, it has an air-conditioned indoor seating, an outdoor space with bar stools as well as a larger alfresco garden area at the back, replete with low seats, benches and astro turf.The staff were friendly, though one can't help but wonder if a little more training would have benefited them.The greatest disappointment though is the reason why anyone would come to a restaurant - the grub. This is were it falls flatter than their quesadillas.The meal started off with 'crispy' corn chips. It was anything but. The corn chips were soft, bland and uninspiring. The dip served weren't of any help either.We ordered the Sparkling Sangaria. The menu stated it has cava, cimarron blanco, yuzu, apple, pear and mint. What was served was a heavily watered-down fruit punch devoid of any alcohol. Obviously, the bartender didn't get the memo for the recipe. Most disappointing indeed. To be fair, the Chorizo con Res Tacos were pretty good. The Elotes (Mexican street-style grilled corn) was arguably the highlight of the meal. The Res (braised beef) quesadillas were pretty decent too.Over all, some hits, some misses.If you are interested, do check out my other reviews

Top notch food in this place which was recommended to us by our guide book, the dishes are well priced and come out in small portions encouraging you to try more, which we did! The quesadilla was really good and they had a couple of new dishes on as well including a nice prawn burrito (never thought I'd try one of those!), and a nice touch was the free drink they brought us out as a honeymoon gift. The staff were very helpful and took plenty of pictures for us as well, despite how busy they were

We read an article about Singapore and the must visit area's for eating and drinking and Duxton Hill was up there as one of the top. From the photos this place looks really lively and colourful and I can assure you it is exactly how you would expect.We ate out in the garden and the place had great music, friendly staff and just a cool vibe about it. The drinks are great - about the same as you would expect to pay anywhere in Singapore and the food is really reasonable. You must try the tacos and the topped nachos, they are just amazing - such a surprise as I would have never put crab on a nacho but it really works!If you are in Singapore and fancy a fun filled evening with good food, drinks and music go here

In the middle of the sissling restaurant area of Duxton Hill you find Lucha Loco. It doesn't look of much when you first see it, but make no mistake. It is exellent! Go for at table on the green area out back (at the side of the restaurant) and start by ordning their Classic frossen Margarita before you dig into the menu.While enjoying a margarita pick out some of the food from the menu. We tried different tacos (lamb, been and chorizo) as well as their quasadillas (chicken, beef and vegetable). The portions are fair sized and the taste great. Prices are reasonable - not expensive! The service is present, quick and very serviceminded. You really feel at home and taken care of.It is hard not to be swept away by the good food, drink and awesome music in the background (not live). So don't try to avoid it! Just go with the flow

Mexican, fresh, quick, fantastic service. We loved walking up Duxton hill, loved the beautiful lights. And. The. Cocktails. Delicious. Blood orange mojito.
4
We had a couple of Tacos on a Wednesday evening and the place was quite crowded. You need 3-4 of them for a price around 11 SGD each. We tried the Ground Beef, Prawn and the Beef Cheek ones. All great taste! Service was swift
4
Love Mexican street food especially Lucha Loco's. It was amazingly good but portions were a bit too small for me.. But definitely will return. Just need to order more :) no complain with the services and love the ambience of this place!
5
Amazed to find such high quality tapas in Singapore. Grab some friends and share some wonderful and varied tapas. Quite stylish so lots of gorgeous people here, Exposed walls, busting atmosphere and mildly chaotic service. Right in Duxton Hills so bars galore to enjoy after

Everything we ordered was good. We had the corn chips, a salsa, the signature elotes, a fish taco, a beef brisket taco, a pork quesadilla and the blue corn cake with mezcal cream.However, the heat levels in the tacos took me completely by surprise. I expected the food here to be spicy but there was no indication in the menu that the tacos were going to be THAT spicy, especially the fish taco. My tolerance for spiciness is fairly modest; I can't go beyond laksa or jalapenos. The next time I come here, I'll make sure to check with the friendly servers on the heat level of the dishes I order. But if mala hot pots or habaneros are your kind of thing, then feel free to order from the menu with abandon.The blue corn cake with mezcal cream was an intriguing dessert. Because frankly, it sounded and even looked rather unappetising but ...... it was delicious. I've never had any dessert quite like it before
1
We were throughly enjoying everything and sitting at a round table with views of the window where the food comes out. The waiter came in from the outdoor seating area and sneezed into his hands. Then picked up a plate of food and took it to a table seconds later! He didn't wash his hands and I was absolutely disgusted. When you see the waiter with pink hair, you should ask him to wash his hands. If he doesn't wash his hands after sneezing into them, there is no telling when else he does not wash them. This restaurant and it's staff and management are clearly in violation of The Environmental Agency's Guidelines on Good Hygiene Practices By Service Staff At Food Establishments. This needs to be taken seriously. http://www.nea.gov.sg/docs/default-source/public-health/food-hygiene/Guidelines/guidelines-on-good-hygiene-practices-to-be-observed-by-service-staff-at-food-establishments-.pdf?sfvrsn=0 This was shocking, upsetting, unacceptable and throughly disgusting. It's also a form or arrogance and neglect on the part of the waiter in question
5
I loved the atmosphere here! We sat outdoors in the garden which is decorated with fairy lights and lanterns, creating a really lovely atmosphere. The food service was quick and tasted delicious. Some of the portions are more tapas like size which was perfect as you could order and share a few different things. There was a crab based taco which I would recommend. I would also recommend a jug of margarita which went down well in the warm Singapore climate :

How good can Mexican food in Asia be? Very good! Lucha Loco is on restaurant filled Duxton Hill. A neat and funky looking place with fast and friendly service. The taco's are small (the way taco's are) and for dinner at least two would make a meal. All have surprising flavour combinations and the meat used is of good quality. Prices are steep, as everywhere in Singapore, for us Europeans. Totally worth the visit
4
Pleasantly surprised by the food quality! Not cheap, but a good hang-out place with savoury treats and better-than-expected cocktails (they don't seem stingy with the tequila for margaritas). We spent ~SGD140 in total for 2 people, and we each had 2 drinks. Had the chips (they gave us a second helping of chips, complimentary, not sure if this is the norm) and the tostaditas to share, and we each had a taco. The taco is stuffed with toppings (wasn't just a scoop of meat on a sad tortilla as expected), and the chorizo/beef brisket taco packed a punch with the spice. This place fills up very quickly even on a weeknight, we went around 5.45pm and the tables right outside the front entrance were already full. By 7pm the place was packed. Seems great for couples and small groups (4 and below seems about right), as the portions are small
4
Visited this nice restaurants on a Friday night. It has a very nice vintage outdoor table where you can catch up with your a group of friends. Good range of Cocktails and finger goods. Staff was friendly. However, do expect to wait for a table during peak hour

Amazing, really enjoyed eating here. The corn is amazing, never had anything like it!! Tacos and buritos were great and the black beans spot on! Would definitely go back.
3
I'm a 5' 6" small eater, and we spent around $70/person for dinner and I still wasn't full. Most of the bill was for food, and each person had one alcoholic drink.We ordered the following:Corn chips with 2 sauces ($12) - the chips were getting stale and were losing their cruchCorn ($8 for half) - corn with cheese, mayo and chili powder. It was pretty nice, but I need to point out that it's $8 for half a corn cob.Ceviche ($22 for a small jar) - bits of fish with mostly vegetables served with some nachos. The sauce was refreshing with lime, herbs and spices. Beef taco ($11) - Probably my favourite part of the meal, this had a lot of tender beef. Chicken quesadillas ($16) - Mostly cheese, with bits of chicken.We also ordered what might have been tostadas ($16), but I am not sure, because we got 4 pieces of small crackers on a plate with a mess of shredded veggies and maybe some crab? (I can't tell because it was a little tiny bit). Maybe it may have been more filling had we ordered the mains ($24 and above), but Lucha Loco could consider increasing the sizes of their portions a little. Or not, since it was a Saturday night, and the entire place was full. It does have it's charm, if you see this as a bar and not a restaurant. The outside area has lots of little lights (incandescent and not very environmentally friendly, but it's charming) and you sit on little wooden stools around little wooden tables. It is marketed as street-side dining, and it does resemble a street side, just without the unpleasant aspects such as dust, cars, and litter. They also have gigantic fans to move the air around, so it's nice and cool.Service was lukewarm, as is common in most Singaporean establishments
4
OK you didn't come to Singapore for Mexican food. But if you need a break from all the fabulous Asian eateries, or have a craving for a good margarita, check out this place. The garden is very pleasant and cooled by fans, the service is very friendly, and the margaritas are very good - they come in pitchers too. Would have been great if the server had mentioned that - but YOU know, now. To the owners: with very little difficulty you could improve the frankly, not very good guacamole. Presently it has too many large chunks, and not enough flavor - there should be onion, the tomatoes should be chopped and not quartered, and it needs chile. But the salsa is excellent
4
Seeing as we couldn't book for 2, we arrived early & got a table outside. Had a few cocktails, starters & tacos. Compared to other Mexican restaurants in Singapore (and I've tried a few) - this wins hands down. It's more costly than others, but living in this town you learn to realise there's a price to pay for quality. Will be returning!!
4
Yummy tacos, refreshing mojitos, good music and friendly service.... Though the small wooden stools in outdoor seating are complete butt busters!! Please think of adding cushions and possible ways to better the ergonomics so that one can enjoy the food, drinks, ambience even more without having to shift weight constantly. Their last food orders are at 10:30 pm which for a Friday evening seemed a tad but too early and you don't get enough of the great food! Overall a must try, even if that means carrying your own cushion!!
4
More of a bar than a restaurant but good at both. The service was friendly and with funster type hipster dudes making it an enjoyable experience. Is popular with a mixed crowd of 20 to 30 somethings. There's a Mexican theme in the food and decor but it doesn't take it too seriously. Good place for an pleasant evening
1
'Authentically Mexican' Certainly is a slap in the face to Mexican cuisine.The food was uninspiring, insipid and consummately devoid of any flavour whatsoever. Coupled with abrupt and discourteous staff this is one abode to bypass assuredly..
1
Went to Lucha couple of times, but this was the absolute worst. Apparently no reservations accepted, however when you come there the tables are reserved, even those for 2 or 3. Staff never returned to inform me whether there were any other places outdoors available as we were cold inside. Despite us asking a couple of times, my request was simply ignored. When we asked for recommendations from the menu, no one knew to explain it to us. The food quality likewise deteriorated since my last visit 6 months prior, particularly the attention given to food plating
4
The food is awesome, a modern take on Mexican. The plates can be shared or eaten as stand alone courses, I would recommend making your way through all the different menu sections, from the tostaditas and the mini tacos to the ceviches and the meats, and end with the wonderful blue corncake. Great drinks, excellent service, relaxed and laid back atmosphere, ideal for both small and big groups. The only critical comment is that the rules for group reservations are so strict they are almost a stress factor
3
This place is famous for their tequila. we had a round of their traditional tequila shots. Their flavored margaritas were really good. I tried the pomegranate and passion fruit, my favourite of the two. I would definitely recommend this place for drinks. The food mainly consists of a variety of tacos. I recommend the fish tacos. I found it ideal that the food came in small proportions, almost tapas style. They were a perfect compliment for the drinks. We ended off the meal with their blue corn cake garnished with tortilla chips. I absolutely loved this dessert, it was so authentic and unique. It sounds different but the combination works well. I would recommend sitting outside in the back patio. The atmosphere is romantic with fairy lights and candles. They even have a tequila cart which I found to be a really cute additional feature
5
Great Atmosphere.
The food was awesome especially the red snapper taco with chipotle mayo. Very tasty,fresh and juicy.
I will definitely go back in my next visit
Try it
5
Best Mexican fusion in Singapore. Great location, great food and fantastic ambience. The fish and beef tacos are a must, and most definitely order the deserts (blue corn cake). Won't be disappointed! !!
5
Loved it, was here with a bunch of friends on a Friday evening where the weather was good, service was attentive and drinks were flowing.We were seated in the outdoor dining area which was great, loved the ambience of the place. Highly recommended for people looking to reminisce European summer in Singapore
4
We had a post work event at this restaurant and I was impressed at the excellent service. Must try the crab mini tacos, the chicken enchiladas and their single serve sized fajitas.They made some great sangria pitchers and mojito pitchers for our group and were extremely quick with service. I'm going back soon
4
All round this is a great place to eat or drink with a good location on Duxton. The staff are a great asset being knowledgeable and friendly as well as putting up with a lot of aggressive questions about the menu here from some embarrassingly loud expats who seemed to think they had priority over all other guests. Cocktails are spectacular too.We arrived for pre-dinner drinks and never left the place was that good and that much fun. Shout out to to our tiny Filipina waitress who was a real star
5
Great little place with loads of atmosphere at Duxton Hill. Staff are accommodating and the food is fast and tasty. Try to spicy corn on the cob, it's the house specialty and delicious. Best margarita I've ever had, try it with no ice. Great little outdoor area and a good spot for an after work drink.
4
Food was very tasty. We had the chips, salsa, guac, pork ribs, tacos and mexican rice. All dishes were very good. The frozen margarita was also delicious.On the expensive side (especially if alcohol is included), but this is singapore...Went at 7 pm on a friday. Not overly packed which was good for a change. Could chose between sitting inside and outside.All in all, definitely recommend it
5
I love to eat at Lucha Loco. The ambiance, food and staff are exceptional! It's such a cool place, and also the best mexican I've had in a long time; you need to try the ceviche. Perfect place to go to with friends, or for a relaxed romantic dinner.
3
I decided to try some Mexican food as the restaurant is introduced as a taqueria and the result was disappointing. When I saw the menu offering taco de carnitas (pork meat in chunks), I ordered immediately, but I was entirely upset when the dish just consisted on the tortilla with a big piece of pork. That's not the traditional way. It was also very small and expensive for that side. As I was still hungry, I tried some quesadillas and all I can say is that the flavor was more Tex-Mex than Mexican.The positive side of this place is the atmosphere, nicely located in Duxton Hill with lots of alfresco tables. The place has a good selection of drinks, including cocktails, spirits and beers. I was very surprised they offered besides Coronas, Sol beer. Sol is a very refreshing and tasty beer from Mexico and not as known as Corona. Getting a couple of those beers took a bit my disappointment away from the food.Would I come back to Lucha Loco? I would be tempted to do so just for the drinks and atmosphere. Maybe as a good place for happy hour after work, that's it
4
To get out the city centre and experience a little bit of Singapore that feels surprisingly like I imagine New Orleans to be head to Duxton Hill, Tanjong Pagar. This is a buzzing part of town frequented by the hip and cool but good for all comers. Great side street restaurants and bars, amazing for a balmy/hot night in Singapore. This area is not to be missed. Less than 15 mins from central Singapore and good for a walk around of an evening.
4
Nice bar and serves good tapas. Always busy, populated with a hip crowd and even if it is busy you can have a drink by the bar. Bar staff very knowledgeable.
5
Food and ambience in Lucha Loco is amazing! My personal favourite- try the Chiveche, you won't regret it!
5
Great food , cocktails and atmosphere. Pricey and service can be slow, but you have awesome cocktails to sip while you wait so it's not too bad!
5
we went w friends last night to Lucha Loco and we had one of the best culinary evenings out for a long time. This is a Mexican restaurant w a twist, not the ordinary mex tex food, this is a culinary journey you don't want to end. First we started w the drinks and had margaritas which were not bad but after trying the passion fruit Smashito is ticked w this for the night. Food wise we started w the delicious totopos salsa, a must, followed by mex street grilled corn. We tried all 3 types of tostaditas, all were good but the beef one was orgasmic we ordered a second round. Then we taxi de res and Baja fish taco, all delicious. We ended w the honey glazed pork ribs, they were good, but compared to the rest of the food, they didn't blow me away. Service is outstanding, we were served by Annie. We had a fantastic evening, a fun place, great vibe, best location (I love duxton hill) and outstanding food. We will be back
5
We were really impressed that you could get such good Mexican food in Singapore! It was so busy we ended up eating at the bar but all of the little dishes we ordered were amazing! The bar is really cool and DJ was great. Worth a visit but get there early...
5
Went to Lucha Loca with a group of local friends on a stopover back to Sydney and I was not disappointed!There is a nice vibe, more of a bar feel than a restaurant and If not too steamy I would sit outside, it's got better atmosphere.The food is authentic Mexican street food so portion sizes and tacos are small (about $10 taco) but really delicious - try the pork and lamb taco and you cannot leave without trying the corn cake, it's amazing!!!! Go on a Friday night when the DJ is playing for some fun and great tunes
3
You cannot fault the location of Lucha Loco and the cocktails are fantastic (trust me I have had many!) but if you are going here for Mexican food there is definitely better value for money in SIngapore! (and thats saying something!) The food just isn't excellent and for the price you pay for it it is not fantastic. We ordered an assortment of Tacos and the Quesadilla when we were there. I think we where expecting something a little larger to start with for the price but when they arrived the portions where small. I am not one to complain about spending money on food - but there was nothing to make me want to go back - except the ambience and the cocktails! I do love the outdoor area here for meeting with friends - I cannot fault it for that
2
We went there after reading some pretty good reviews, but for me I found the food dreadful, tomato salsa that was so bland I thought it was out of a jar, the guacamole had an oily aftertaste, there were none of the flavours you would expect either, the hint of lime, chillies and coriander they were all missing and that was just for the starter! this was followed by a crab starter which was okay but was served with far too much raw cabbage. We then chose a pork belly taco and a red snapper taco, which was served in a cardboard wrap/plate, yet again although the snapper was okay the belly pork was dry, and there is something missing from the overall taste in all the dishes. I have to say though the server we had was lovely and very good at her job. The ambience of the place left me wondering if this is really just a bar selling "snacks" that are really not that tast
5
The best restaurant on a cool street, with happy clientele spilling out on to the sidewalk. The fun starts from the pavement, to the back door. And when the sun goes down, there's a DJ with great tunes, so you can kick on when the plates are cleared.Delicious food which is not Tex Mex, but authentic and very tasty. Great flavours, and great for sharing so this place is perfect for a group of friends. We went with 15 of our closest and had a set menu, which was good value, and took the guesswork out of ordering.The tequila shots a must with a delicious chaser! Not cheap, but for Singapore prices, and a good night out, it is reasonable
4
Lucha Loco is a well run establishment. Portions are good and prices are reasonable. Wine list is OK, but cocktails are better. The menu is authentic and not overly complicated. Service is warm and friendly.Biggest issue is a/c in the restaurant. It was becoming hard to enjoy the food when it was too hot as a/c was clearly dysfunctional
3
Very small selection of so-so dishes with very patchy service.A lively and noisy atmosphere nearly makes up for the poor quality of the cooking.It is grotesquely overpriced for what it is and I suspect it is a passing fad.
5
Amazing food, drinks and atmosphere. Chorizo taco is to remember and the pescado is perfect as a main course ... Can't go more than a month without visiting Lucha Loco!
4
Ate here once. We were a party of 4 and ordered an array of dishes. Can't complain about the food. Everything we ordered was delicious but not enough of it. It is a pricey Mexican restaurant and left not feeling satisfied. Portion control tight.
5
This little gem has great atmosphere, incredible food and delicious drinks. One of my favourites in Singapore. A guaranteed great night outdoors on their deck. You must have the ceviche and the snapper taco. All staff know the food and are super helpful.
4
Great place to have drinks with friends. If you get a table outside its great atmosphere and a wonderful way to people watch. The margheritas are tasty but the other drinks are quite watered down. In hindsight one should ask for the vodka and soda water separately as the drink they served me was very watered down. The food is okay, nothing to write home about. This place is always buzzing and has a great feel to it. I have come here on many occasions and its always a fun night
5
Lucha Loco is a our go-to spot when out-of-towners visit Singapore.The ambience is one of the best in town for it's chilled setting (especially in the garden bar) and great sounds, it's a place for conversation - rowdy or intimate - and a bit of cheekiness especially when Lucha's delicious cocktails are involved!The Lucha team are always friendly and go above and beyond to anticipate our needs, which is somewhat unique in Singapore. It's obvious they are as passionate about the food and drink as the people who visit.The Food - The best saved for last - It is authentic and TASTY! The menu is creative and offers great variety. It's difficult not to keep ordering more. The Fish Bajo Taco is a favourite.Lucha Loco consistently makes my list of Singapore must-visits
4
After suffering through the plastic-fantastic Mexican joints in Singapore over the past several years, it's great to finally have a modern Mexican joint that delivers on what you expect from a south-of-the-border experience:- good mojitos;- excellent corn chips and guac;- proper gourmet soft tacos.And don't forget a busy, buzzy, and bubbly atmosphere. Surprisingly, our favourite dish is the mango and snapper ceviche, which is incredibly refreshing and tasty.To top it off, there isn't fajita in sight. Head to any one of the tacky taco joints like Iguana's if you're looking for that
4
I have mixed feelings about Lucha Loco. Yes, the chips, guacamole, and tacos are all delicious. Yes, the margaritas are excellent. Yes, the ambiance is very fun and lively. But when our 30 minute turned into well over an hour, and tacos were priced at $10+ each, my perception soured a bit. That being said, the tacos are fairly well sized, so two roughly equals a small entree
5
Been here a few times and have to say it is one of my favourite places in Singapore. Great food, buzzing ambience and excellent service. I am a big fan of their Passionfruit Smashito, love the Mexican street corn (and i am not usually a big fan of corn) as well as the beef tostaditas and chicken quesadilla. I always recommend this place to my friends and everyone loves it
5
This place was jammed when we visited. After a 45min wait drinking Margaritas we were seated. The food is great and the different tacos were tasty. It is different to the usual Tex Mex fare. Well worth a visit to a nice spot in Singapore among the shop houses
4
Great place to start your night out at.. Good food, drinks and nice people..The Ceviche and the tostaditas are great for sharing.. The buzz builds up during the evening and you will leave the place happy..
5
Every dish was amazing! A great mix from subtle to spicy and accompanied by some top shelf tequila. The owners are always around to make sure you're looked after. Could eat this food everyday.
5
GREAT LOCATION FOR SOME OUTDOOR DRINKS
Attentive host personal, friendly waiters, good drinks and food.....we will go back there!!
5
Whenever I've friends visiting Singapore, I bring them to Lucha Loco. It's one of my absolute favorite hang outs and all friends I've taken there loves it too.Reasonably priced authentic Mexican food, (the snapper ceviche to die for!) good drinks (passion smashito it's a must!) and just that cool and nice vibe that makes you wanna visit again.I do warmly recommend this place
3
We were a family of 5. seeing that there were very good reviews on this restaurant, we went to it last night. the front desk customer service was good. When we got to our table, the plates were not put out for each person which was not a good look for a restaurant. We were given water towards the end of our meal. Margaritas were decent. The mojito was average. The food was very average though.I think I expected more out of the food. We had the quesadillas which may be the nicest out of the whole meal. The flautas was rather bland for our taste buds. The mushroom dishes such as the taco tasted like the mushrooms had been barbequed therefore giving them a burnt taste. We also found the portions extremely small for the price we paid for it. it was good to check it out once especially for its ambience but I will not be going back again
4
One thing Singapore has seen recently is an influx of good, quality and authentic Mexican restaurants. Lucha Loco easily comes out tops in terms of Mexican food in Singapore in my book. My friend and I started off with the corn which was INCREDIBLY good; tons of flavor and cooked nicely. Quite delicious and authentic. We then moved on to some tacos (chorizo and fish). I had the Chorizo and it was tasty and a bit spicy. But the tacos were excellent. Definitely having the fish tacos next time as my friend said they were wonderful. We ended by splitting a plate of the ribs which were cooked well; not the best I've ever had but very flavorful and tender. Margaritas were also pretty good as well as the guacamole and chips. The service here was pretty good: food came at an insanely quick pace. We had the corn within a few minutes, the tacos a few minutes after that, and the ribs shortly thereafter. All food was on the table within about 10 minutes which I wasn't sure if I should be happy about or alarmed about. But it was tasty and that's what matters.The restaurant has a wonderful vibe to it and the decor is great. It is pricey though (the ribs were just under S$40 and it wasn't a lot of ribs to be honest, maybe a half slab at most) but it is totally worth it as the food is authentic and delicious
5
Having lived in the states I became a huge fan of good Mexican food and Lucha Loco never disappoints in serving the best Mexican food in Singapore! The snapper taco and Mexican street corn are not to be missed. Friday nights are their busiest, need to go early to land a table, if not there's a super cool later night vibe…beware the margaritas there addictive and strong
4
We were bar hopping around tanjong pagar area last Sat, 11 Jan 2014. And this is the first bar we went to. We were there around 1030pm until 1130pm. We ordered only drinks, beer, mojito and michelada(corona) which is really good. We were seated at the bar that night since they were full. When we were halfway through our drinks, we saw this bartender discussing something to the waiter. I think they were discussing about the drinks in front of them. Then the bartender suddenly took out the straw from the drink and tasted it by sucking it. Much to our surprise, he puts the straw back in the drink and the waiter didn't mind at all and brought the drinks to the customer. It all happened in front of us and they didn’t mind. That time, I wanted to tell the managers (not sure if the 2 caucasian ladies at the door were the managers) or the cashier lady about it but they were quite busy that night. The bartender is quite slim, speaks malay and is wearing a cap. There are 2 CCTV cameras at the bar and one near the cashier where it all happened. The management can review this. But that's not all, after maybe 5mins, my friend went to the restroom and she saw the same bartender, standing near the kitchen where they put the foods to be delivered to the customer, and he was munching on them, I think he grabbed some food twice.I’m not sure if I’ll be coming back here but if I do, I’ll definitely sit at the bar where you can see all the action

While somewhat pricey, Lucha Loco simply has the best Mexican food in Singapore. Sadly, they are a victim of their own success as by 9 pm the crowd is so big that it becomes difficult to get decent service. If you want a nice quiet dinner, some great food and good service, go early. If you want shots of tequila and can put up with bad service, go later. It would be nice if the management could figure out how to turn all the business into more revenue, but they seem to be ok with things as they are..
5
last night my son (who lives in singapore) took me to lucha loco for friday night dinner. the place was packed. they sat us at the bar and we had immediate service. the food was excellent and the margarita the best!!! the chiveche is absolutely wonderful. yes, it is pricy but great to get such a good meal for your $$$$ in singapore.thank you... i hope to return before heading to mexico next week!!
5
What a night! I was in town meeting some friends and we couldn't have chosen a better place! Fantastic food and deadly margaritas! The best mix if you ask me! cant wait to be back :)
4
I spent a few years in Texas so I've been missing Mex / Tex Mex (yes there is a difference but it's hard to find either in Singapore). I was thrilled to try this again, and again...
Not cheap but you get quality.

I've been to Lucha many times. The location is great and the vibe is good. The menu is a bit pricey but the food very tasty. Service (particularly getting drinks) is typically a problem but it's never been as bad as my last visit. I took a friend who was in town for a visit and spent most of the dinner apologising on behalf of the restaurant. Lucha is always busy and the staff just can't seem to cope. I will not be returning.We went on a Saturday night for dinner. We arrived before it was super busy. Our male server could have cared less about us. It took ages to get a drink - even after we ordered them. First we had to try and flag him down and then I had to remind him that we were still waiting on a drink. At this point he took my card to start a tab - in other words, he hadn't placed my order. The second drink order was more of the same. Trying to flag down our waiter. Following up because he seemed to have forgotten, etc. The drink didn't arrive until we were seated at a table outside - 15mins later. As we were seated, we asked him if we could have a plate of chips, salsa and guac. It did not come. I followed up. Apparently he'd forgot to put the order in. We apparently had a new server but she was so busy with the other tables to bother coming over to us. We sat there waiting for someone to come over to us but no one did.At this point, I went and told the hostesses what a terrible experience we were having.The hostess came over and got us water, followed up on a missing beer order + the chips and guac and then came back to take our order. The chips and guac arrived as I sat back down so although it had been forgotten, the server must have put it in when I reminded him. Although the hostess took our order and apologised for the experience, apparently she didn't enter our whole order into the system. So 2 of our 4 mexican tapas dishes didn't come. We followed up with our server. She went to check on the order and then explained the problem. We re-ordered our food with her. I ordered a glass of wine from a different water who stopped by our table to ask if we needed anything. It didn't arrive. So one of the servers had to track it down. Our female server came back and told us that they had run out of wine glasses (not sure how this happens at 9pm on a Saturday) and she asked me to change my order. I explained that I wanted a glass of wine and asked if they could put it in a tumbler. They did and it didn't take too long to get the drink after this but I'd been waiting for quite some time already.Then, another server come by and pours water in my wine!! So I waited all this time for a drink and then it's ruined. He apologises and I am told he will get me a replacement. At this stage, our missing dishes arrive. My replacement wine shows up (in a wine glass) just after this. We then order a beer. After over 10mins of waiting we decide we've had enough and we're going to leave. We cancel the order with another server and get the bill. We wait for 15mins for the bill. It comes and they have charged us for the beer. I go to sort the bill out. They want me to wait at the table but I explain that we've been waiting for quite some time already and that we would like to leave. Can they please just sort out the mistake? It's correct that we ordered 5 beers but given how long it took to get one of them, we cancelled it. So it shouldn't be on the bill. They re-do the bill - it seems to be a very complicated process because it wasn't a 5sec wait. I also had to stop the cashier from doing other things besides sorting out our incorrect bill. The cashier finally gives me the new credit card receipts. I'm so fed up by this point that I just check to make sure that there are only 4 beers on it. I didn't notice that she'd had the audacity to charge me for the replacement wine. This was supposed to be free because of the water incident. So we ended up paying for that wine when we shouldn't have.I've tried to rationalise the bad service in the past but this was just over the top. What a terrible experience. Never again.What a headache

So far as I have tried, the answer is yes. We started with chips and salsa, both excellent, made with care. And naturally we had to order cocktails. We had their margarita (frozen, because the rocks one isn't available in Jug format) and I went for the Mexico Mule (like Moscow Mule but with Tequila). I found both to be a bit too sweet but aside from that they were delicious. Naturally we had to order the tacos for dinner. I went for a trio including Barbacoa, Carnitas, and Pescado. Yum, yum, and yum. The meat was tender and savory, the veggies were fresh, the salsa savory and bright and the tortillas soft and fresh. Check it out

I've been there twice. The elotes were super, the tacos tasty, the service friendly and attentive. However, given the small size of the portions, without anything else on the plate as a side, and the fact that it is Mexican street food, not high cuisine, I would consider that it is surprisingly over priced. Also, be prepared to be told, upon sitting down, that you can only stay for two hours

Coming from the US, the land of taco twelve packs, I did a double-take upon seeing the price of the $12-15 tacos (for just one). However, my wife and I each had two different tacos, and each one was unique, delicious, and filling. If you're just looking for a plain beef and cheese taco, this is not the place to go. If you want high quality ingredients and creative food -but that isn't too weird to actually eat, this is a good place to go. We also had the guac and chips - which was good but a rather small size. Next time we will try the ceviche. Drinks were pretty good and priced similarly to other nearby restaurants. On the whole it was the best Mexican and the best place around Duxton Hill so far

I moved to Copenhagen and already craving for a Baja fish taco and a ceviche, always when visited feel like eating the whole food that offer in the menu. everything is absolutely rich and beautiful presentation, delicious, taste and specially worth the price a lot. Will keep craving myself till my next visit in Singapore... Recommend this place 100% also is a very nice place to hang out with your friends and after a pleasant dinner you all can be ready to rock the night with some Tequila and Margarita shots

We (6 of us) flew into Singapore on Friday night, went straight for dinner at Lucha Loco....Standing room only given such a late night hunger decision.Amazing vibe, loads of fun.Bar tenders were outstanding and a great laugh.One of the owners, Julian, treated us like local rockstars.The food, fit for Mexicans: Cervice was amazing, the ribs, the tacos...Sigh, my only request of the owners... please come and set up in Sydney!

Met a friend Lucha Losa last week - Great food and nice vibe ! This place really knows what it is doing and has clearly mastered it's offering. Really nice location which attracts those in the know - sufficiently off beaten track to be for locals and not tourists. Food great -- exceptional salsa and really wonderful Sweetcorn with spices and Mexican cheese.Good wines and all very well doneIf in town - well worth a visi

This was our second visit in six months. It was a Friday night and we were just lucky to get a table. The owner said as it is F1 practice night a lot is happening in town. Yet, it seemed every table inside and outside and every bar stool was occupied. It meant there weren't many people waiting outside to get a table! Otherwise, it is extremely busy on weekends.In a matter of less than 12 months the two brothers of Tanjong Beach Club have done amazing wonders at Lucha Loco. We just loved the Tacos - lamb, scallops, beef you name it they have it. The spice was just right. The after taste remained but not the fireworks. The blue cake and creme brulee to end were extraordinary. It is indeed a great place with family, friends or your partner. The service is superb. It is loud but you get the staff making continuous rounds and without being pushy they are extremely friendly. The secret could be there is no service charge. All tips go to the servers, so there is an incentive to delight the customer and I must say that works.We are sorry, we will miss its First Birthday party on the last weekend of Sep 2013. It is going to be a big bash

Singapore has a huge lack of decent Mexican food and this is so far the best in Singapore, however that doesnt say much as it was only OK. The place is good for groups and has a decent vibe both indoors and outdoors.

Located "top" of the hill offers the openness and spacious sensation. Like the interior design a bit raw and faded in the touch of Mexico. Food is delicious so as the drinks. I had Mojito so refreshing!
5
Hands down some of the best tacos I've had anywhere in Asia. The carnitas, the fish, the chorizo, and especially the scallop tacos were flawless. Everything down to the tortilla is authentic and the blackberry margarita was an excellent surprise. I'll be back next time I spend more than 24 hours in Singapore

A fun Mexican restaurant to go to. While the atmosphere is buzzing I did not find it noisy or oppressive. You cannot make a reservation so you just have to go there and wait for a table. You can have a drink at the bar while waiting. The food is authentic Mexican and is delicious as were the margaritas. The roasted corn with cheese starter was so good. Taco and salsa dips were scrumptious and the well filled burritos and enchiladas were to die for. The walls are adorned with photographs and posters of various bands and masked Mexican wrestlers. Friendly attentive staff helped make this very popular fun restaurant a regular on our nights out. Give it a try

i have been going back to lucha loco again and again. the tacos are to die for. i just can't get sick of them. my fave is the pork belly (carnitas) taco. oh! and the elotes, just delicious. the margaritas are a must-try. love the unpretentious, casual atmosphere of the restaurant

We went on a Saturday evening. They sat us at a table outside, as it was rather busy. We were seated by the waiter, who then stood awkwardly by our table waiting for our drinks order. We decided on our food, however it took ages for someone to take our order. We wanted some corn appetisers, and then were told they stop doing them after a certain time. We ordered nachos and dips to start, which never arrived. After numerous times of asking for them, they arrived, minus the guacomole, and after the starters!! One of the mains then arrived, however my taco never arrived. Once again, I had to chase my order up, via numerous members of staff. Eventually two tacos arrived, which I had only ordered one! The staff really are clueless. They should not be calling themselves a restaurant, this is a bar doing bar snacks. It was overpriced, pretentious, and the staff want sacking. When we come to pay, they verbally asked me for my pin number. I have never ever witnessed such terrible service in one evening. It's a shame as the food was quite nice. I would NOT recommend this to anyone

Friday night this is a great place to be. Be prepared to wait for a table, but its worth it. The ambience is great. They have a steady flow of margaritas thanks to the giant churner machines that practically put the margarita on tap. Quality wise, margaritas at Dempsey's Margaritas tops it, but the food is far superior here. The Corn cob with chili cheese is sensational. The tacos wre fresh and tangy. Great expat crowd. Lovely music. Ohhhhh and the margaritas are made with honey- healthy

The helpings of tapas are tiny and you pay through the nose... We have been to several restaurants around duxton hill and this was the worst value for money. Fine if you want a beer and sit outside, but inside the acoustics are so bad you can't hear what your friends say... Although I do hear there is another room so check where the table is before you sit! The battered fish was the size of a sardine... And there was only one! I may have got over the food part if it wasn't for the grumpy waitress that wasn't bothered about taking orders and we had to ask after our food

Great place to unwind with friends after work on a Friday. Despite wait for a table, staff are prompt in ensuring drinks/food (full menu is served at the bar too) gets to you swiftly. Fresh and tasty food with several vegetarian options; not just the token tofu taco. Guacamole is one of the best in Singapore. Generous pitcher of sangria. Easy to stuff yourself silly here; don't know how these girls in bandage dresses do it.Regarding the earlier comment on pricing, Mexican/Western food is generally not cheap in Singapore (it's like how in western countries, you'd pay S$15 for laksa when you'd be insane to pay more than S$3.50 for it here). Not to mention most ingredients are probably imported. So no it's not cheap, but its within the range of what I would expect to pay for for a restaurant in this area.Will definitely visit again. Great to see a Mexican addition to the Duxton strip

Located at 15 Duxton Hill, Singapore, Lucha Loco is a popular taqueria and garden bar serving Mexican food and quality tequilas. A great place to meet friends for a relaxing evening of cocktails, but if you are hungry and don't want to break the bank be sure to order main meals rather than their mexican tapas option. If you like juicy cobs of corn try the Elotes which bursts with flavour on ever bite and the delicious vegan dish, Chiles Relanos, a roasted poblano pepper stuffed with rice, herbs and wild mushrooms. If you love desserts try Pastel de Elote Azul, Moistened with agave nectar, this is a cake made with blue cornmeal topped with mezcal alcohol-spiked whipped cream

Lucha Loco is definitely the best Mexican restaurant in Singapore.
Food is very authentic and the staff are super nice.
Great atmosphere. Great for friends to hang out.
Awesome music and occasional cute DJ on the weekends.
I HEART this place! xxxxx

Great food, good resonably priced wine, and a fun atmosphere. Very busy so ensure you get there early to snag a fabulous outside table. Very fun.

Full Review with pics: http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/04/lucha-loco.htmlLucha Loco, a place that sells gourmet mexican street food, has been receiving rave reviews since it opened last year and we were glad that our experience with the food there turned out to be an amazing and memorable one.I did not regret ordering the Elotes($8) despite knowing that it was just a corn. No, I should correct myself and say that it was an extraordinary grilled corn smeared with chilli, mayonaise and cotija cheese that burst out sweet juices in each bite. I never knew a corn could have such a great allure.I imagined the Crab Tostaditas with habanero, avocado and cucumber ($16) to be crunchy and creamy but somehow the dish did not deliver the taste. They were on the light, bland side.Our favourite was this vegan dish, Chiles Relanos($24), an ugly-looking roasted poblano pepper stuffed with rice, herbs and wild mushrooms. Every spoonful of filling with the heavenly pumpkin sauce simply lifts up your mood. So delicious that I did not mind skipping other meaty mains.As a dessert lover, I was sad to see only two items but ended up extremely pleased with the Pastel de Elote Azul ($14), a crumbly cake made with blue cornmeal topped with mezcal alcohol-spiked whipped cream. (Though it was served after 20min and not 5min as informed by the waiter) Moistened with agave nectar, the cake had a unique coarse texture and a subtle sweetness. Who says good cakes must be light and fluffy? This one is divine--a MUST TRY....To conclude, this is definitely the place to go for some authentic Mexican street food. If you are coming here for a full meal, I recommend that you order the main meal that are larger in portions as prices adds up when you order those small-sized appetizers. Plus, the cocktails here are not to be missed for those who loves drinking. Do go early before the crowd streams in as there is no reservations! Go late for their DJ music and u might meet the man in the mask. Full reviews with pics : www.dairycream.blogspot.s

This place has some good tacos and quesadillas. However the other dishes are so-so. Most disappointing were the nachos and guacomole and salsa. Flavourless and not fresh-tasting.Beware, every time you order more chips, salsa or guac, you will be charged an additional 5-8 sgd .. A surprise when the bill arrived. Overall so-so food in a nice place but the prices and level of service (slow and not prompt) are not worth it. I would come here for drinks only, not for a full dinner. Do not try to split the bill with a large group; that is impossible due to the way they do the bill.Sorry I will give this place a miss next time, however cool it looks

Could not fault this restaurant for food and service and atmosphere. The food was delicious. We had the snapper taco and the corn and frijoles sides and the chicken quesadillas. Amazing. So fresh and full of flavour. The food came quickly and while it was annoying we couldn't book we got the last table inside. It was a bit noisy but fine. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting fine yummy fare but without any formality or fuss

Our second time in six months. Hardly come across a decent Mexican restaurant in Singapore. This one is by the famous Aussie brothers of Tanjong Beach Club fame. Another fabulous place and a chef that gets you to bite your fingers off.Not any different it was at this authentic Taqueria. We even got a table outdoors by almost full moon. Delightful evening with friends. Fantastic original dishes and both brothers are serving to make you feel Queen & King.Perfect place for a good evening for two or a dozen. We were eight and we could all converse and enjoy the great place

I love this place so much, i am no a big lover of spicy food, but i give it a try and my favourites are Beef taco and Elotes ''corn' with cheese, the frozen margaritas are very worth it, they are very strong and make your Night happy from the very beginning of your first drink. Love this place and the service is so sweet and good. sometimes can be very crowder so it might take long to get things. but be patience this place worth it totally. Me gusta mucho Lucha loco

Amazing food & drinks. Fabulous atmosphere with an indoor or alfresco dining to choose from. A place to chill after a hard day's work or simply to catch up with friends. A good mix of local & expat crowd can be seen here. The food are robustly flavourly & the ingredients used are very fresh. A good mix of drinks to choose from.The cocktails are absolutely yummy & the passionfruit caprioska is highly recommended. Not to be missed is also their wide selection of tequila offered which is ultra smooth & very addictive. On the weekends, there is a DJ spinning. The staff are superb, very attentive & quick to oblige. The service is impeccable

The food here is great and you can guarantee you'll have fun visiting this restaurant.I've been a couple of times now - once with work colleagues (sitting inside) and more recently with friends (sitting outside).It's a little frustrating that you can't book.The waiting staff are very pleasant but most are clueless - you can guarantee you'll see people walking up and down with plates of food, with no idea of where they are going and who has ordered them. Similarly you can wait for hours for a dish, only to be told it's not been made yet.The food is worth waiting for though - especially the beef starter.The cocktails are disappointing: too sweet and sugary and I really couldn't taste tequila in the margarita mixes at all. Just tastes like fruit juice, ice and lots of sugar. Same for the mojitos. The boys in our group were onto a winner ordering beers as you can guarantee what you're getting!All in all, good fun but not sure I'd go back again. Not a bad effort though and if you are a big group wanting a fun evening it's worthwhile

On our last trip to Asia I read in a magazine about Lucha Loco which recommended it as a Mexican place worth going to in Singapore so on our return from Jakarta, I was really looking forward to trying it on a Friday night before we left. We made the mistake of not making a reservation, which was our fault, but we turned up there at 7.30pm to find it already heaving, due to the fact that it is near the CBD in Duxton. We asked if there was any chance of getting a table and we were told that we could put our name down on the list and it would probably take around 45 minutes. They took our number and told us to make sure that we could hear it etc.We went somewhere else nearby for a drink, as it was standing room only outside, and waited, and waited...and waited. Around an hour and a half later my husband walked over and asked how much longer it was likely to be and was told that we could squeeze four of us around a table for two or wait a little longer for a bigger table to become available. We decided to opt for the latter as we had two big lads with us. At just before 10pm my husband looked at his phone and noticed he'd had a missed call and so went over to see if it was the restaurant. It was and they had already crossed us off the list and claimed to have called numerous times, when in fact they had only tried once eight minutes previously and decided that we weren't worth calling again! My husband was extremely angry having waited for the best part of two hours and I was very disappointed as I had been looking forward to eating here. The worst thing was that they left us in a situation when it was late and had to try to find somewhere else to eat. As it turned out we went to a very nice Italian place down the road, so the evening turned out ok in the end.While I appreciate that we should have made a reservation and not missed the one phone call they made in two hours, I do think that the way we were treated was very unfair
