Lovely little restaurant. Food is great and really low cost for quality cuts. Had the beef short rib and it was absolutely delicious. Friend had the beef sandwich which also looked very good. Just can't get over the price considering the quality and portion size.
4
When I come here I know the quality of my meal is going to be high and that value for money will happen. It has a great deli where really good quality food can be purchsed
5
Whilst the restaurant is family focused and quite basic the burger I had was supurb. Lots of flavour, so juicy, great roll. The only thing I can think of to improve it would have been sweet potato fries.
5
Good place to go for meat! It is really a no-fuss meat place, but the steaks are usually done properly according to taste.
4
Hubers offers still good quality European food for Lunch or a snack in between. Mostly the same staff for long time provides good services.
5
Huber’s Bistro is a lovely place to have your Meat! Freshest ever, spoil for choice for all cuts of beef steak. Decided to have the chicken schnitzer for a change and it’s so tasty. Love the apple spritzer as well. Restaurant setting a bit crowded during lunch.

Not cheap. Mostly western white folk, likely on expat terms with flexible expendable income. Quality of food is so-so. Nothing spectacular. But the space it fills is big and wide. Very comfortable, although the afternoon sun can get challengingly hot. Good place for families and big groups. Not really the romantic hangout for couples
2
Such as shame about the bistro as the butcher is fantastic - so how they manage to make such horrible burgers with all the best ingredients just upstairs is beyond me - but they do!They manage to transform great meat into miserable tasteless sludge - its a real insult to the cows that died for this beef.You'd be hard pressed to tell the difference if you got some frozen burgers made of Mechanically recovered meatWhats worse is that they're rated as the best in singapore but the corrupt food bloggers clogging up googles results pagesPlease pass this feedback on to the management/ the che

August 26 & 27th 2017 huber butchery celebrated their 10th years anniversary they invite their members and family and friends. The huber family also present, they were very generous with lots of foods, free beer, wine, ice cream, pop corn and water and many more.It was very well organize, there was queue but not too long you get your food fairly quick. Staff was polite, friendly and happily clearing tables refilling foods.It was a very enjoyable party, very satisfying .Thank you Huber we will continue to support and patronize your shop.Thank you for a great day shared

It was a hot day and waited for 30 mins for indoor table. There is reservation tablet when you arrive and the restaurant will call when your table is ready. It was okay to wait.. we headed to the store to shop and the ac cooled us down.Service was prompt and friendly . We ordered the currywurst and beef burger to share We are small eaters and found the portions sufficient for three of us . Food is well priced and there were lunch special items too. Both items were delicious . They don't serve tap water, so be prepared to pay for bottled water. Good selection of beverages, but we tend to drink water with our meals. Very kid friendly as there's a playground next to the restaurant .We enjoyed the food and will be back to try the other items.
1
We were told at the reservation machine to approach a member of staff for a table, which we did. Queue an extremely rude reception and lecture by said staff.
We took our business elsewhere.
5
Not just an A class butcher with pretty much all cuts that one needs, but also a place where you find that something special you are looking for, be it for a festive occasion or for a special dinner. The staff behind the meat counter is more than obliging an very helpful. Inexpensive it is not but it is difficult to reconcile high quality with low prices. Worth a visit, or two
5
Has the best selection of cold cuts and meats in Singapore, both fresh and frozen. Quality is really good and you get your meat cut anyway you like it. Also a great selection of bread, beer, wine, condiments etc. I always feel like I could buy the entire store when I am there. Friendly staff and reasonable price level!
5
I regret that I only started to go to Huber's a year ago, I really missed out on quality of life (and food) for a long time. A wide selection of best meat, sausages, cheese, bread, wine etc. at decent prices makes me return on a weekly basis. Homemade sausages are probably the best in Singapore, and the service is very professional and friendly.Always good to go there
5
This was recommended by a business partner and we had a sumptuous meal there. Took a fillet mid done and was soft & tender and surprising the price is much affordable. What we have taken easily cost us close to 2X in a place that I went for steak annually. Staff was also friendly and attentive to us. The only shortfall for this place is transportation, take a Uber there or bus and walk in if you do not drive. A great place to relax and chat that is away from disruption of urban places.

Was here with the family to celebrate Mother's Day. Located at the foot of Dempsey Hill means we had the luxury of avoiding the crowd and ample parking. Huber Butchery is made up of a mini market and Bistro. It also has an outdoor playground for the kids.Mini-market:Stocked with products from limited European & Australia brands, variety would not be its strongest suit. However, it is still a nice place to shop for meat and ingredients used in western cooking, which are not easily available at the local supermarketsBistro:Casual dinning set-up with both indoor (limited capacity) and outdoor area which is cool a breezy. As they attract a crowd and do not take reservation. Do factor in some waiting time (We waited for 25mins to get our table).Food:We had the Huber's Beef Burger, Kässpätzle, Australian Pasture Fed Lamb Chops & “Martelli” Pasta with Huber’s Meat Balls. Except for the burger, which was a bit dry, the rest were well prepared and of proper portion
4
I really enjoyed food here, I got the Australian Angus beef and it was delicious. I think price is according to the quality of what you get. Unfortunately, they don't have the most friendly staff, which made the experience not a 5 star. Focusing only on the food, I would totally repeat, but I won't because of the unfriendly staff

What a disaster. This was one of the worst lunch experiences I have ever had in Singapore. We arrived at 11.30am and were told it was a 15-30 minute wait. One and half hours later we were still waiting. We kept being told it was 10 minutes and that we were next. The fact that we had two very hungry kids who were getting hit by the sun in the uncovered playground and waiting area made it even worse. Why didn’t they have a simple reservation system.Finally we got a table. Quite why Hubers have no reservation system is beyond me, all the anger felt by me and everyone else waiting could have been removed had they just had a reservation system. They also didn’t have many tables yet had lots of space for them. Despite ordering while in the queue the assistants then kept coming to us to order. Then all the food came at the same time despite us clearly stating that we wanted starters before the main course. Then one main course came and one disappeared. They claimed we cancelled it when all we did was ask for it to come after our starter.The food wasn’t even very good. Even our kids didn’t like the sausages and chips, the pasta was inedible and the meatballs tasteless.The manager was so appalled by what happened that he took 10% off the bill without being asked which I was about to

We had lunch at the bistro on Labour Day, it was very busy with queue time of around 30 minutes. While waiting we just shop around in the European style grocery store. This place has a wide range of quality meat products, dairy products, etc.We got a call from the bistro automated queue system when our table was ready. We were glad to get a table under the air-con on this hot day, it will be uncomfortable to dine at the open area. Service staff were competent and attentive, we appreciate the initiative of staff (Vijay if not mistaken) who came over to assure us that our orders are on the way as there was a slight delay due to the lunch crowd. Food was worth the wait, our beef burger and beef short rib were excellent, we pretty much helped the dish washer to clean up these plates. I felt the portion was fitted to Asian diners probably, I wished my burger dish would be slightly bigger
5
I've always loved the wide range of meat available in Huber's! This time it's Argentine steak! On display were ribeye and sirloin cuts. You go to the bistro and let them know which cut and type of meat you want, they get the meat from the butchery. You can specify the size too. A 300+g ribeye costs $36, with mash and salad sides. It probably costs about $80 in another good restaurant.
5
I took my 4yo daughter here for brunch and we loved it. The food was amazing, but the inclusion of such a great playground was a brilliant idea. I think we ended up spending 2-3 hours here.
4
Butchery is amazing-- great selection of cuts and exclusive stuff. Expensive but very worthwhile....
5
A family favourite restaurant with good quality customer service and consistently good food quality. Lovely surroundings with landscaped gardens and premium own supermarket for you to get your meats etc.
3
Huber's is a good affordable option within the Dempsey compounds if one is looking for a decent substantial breakfast. The food is great, but not mind-blowing. For the price and location, it is definitely worth it.However, I do think the quality of food has decreased ever since they underwent expansion and renovated the place. The selection of food options remained the same, but somehow the quality seems to be a little off and not as great as in the past when it was a smaller eatery.That being said, come early if one wants to avoid queuing and before families arrive with their screaming children in tow

My Wife and I tried the Bistro for Sunday lunch. Mid-priced food compared to much of what you find on Dempsey road. Ingredients were quite fresh and nicely prepared. Taste, honestly, was nothing special. I had the premium burger while my Wife ordered sausage. Everything was fine.The beer was quite good. I would definitely return for a beer or two! Service was mixed. Vijay was super, thoughtful, and alert. Meanwhile one of the other staffers simply could not stand that I kept the beer bottle at my table. It was a beer I liked and wanted to take a photo to ask my German colleague about. She literally tried to take it four times. Like a game of cat and mouse.Small stuff, really. But odd. The butcher shop has always given great service. I buy all my special occasion meats at Huber. I will be back to the butcher shop, absolutely. The Bistro? Maybe.
2
Grocery is excellent with great choices, prices are on the higher side. Bistro is a canteen style place, not comfy/cose/warm at all. Curry sausage comes with curry tomato sauce/ketchup, doesn't taste home made. Filet steak comes with blue cheese sauce, tastes very much like an instant sauce as well. The sauce destroys the taste of the meat entirely. Mash potatoe ... freshly made or instant? Don't know but the experience wasn't a good one at all. Did expected it better.
4
You can easily spend an afternoon looking round the butchers and deli section, there is such a variety to take in. Quality and range of food is excellent, service is good and whilst some prices are high, others are very reasonable. Surprisingly so at times. So, once you've done that and made your wallet/purse a tad lighter(!) it's time for a well earned rest and nowhere better that Huber's Bistro
5
The best butchery in Singapur. They sell also wines, sauces, chokolades and many high end food from all around the world.Al fresco have some tables where you can be served with their most popular dishes like sausages, fried chickens, fabolous burghers, pastas and desserts.Prices are high but you are in one of the most expensive cities in the world
5
Amazing shop, we couldn't believe our luck having found Huber's. Fantastic and high quality selection, authentic produce and wonderful service. The meat and sausage selection is just wonderful. We haven't had a 'real' and authentic Fleischwurst for over 20 years, this one is the bomb! Enjoyed the Wiener too. We were surprised by the selection of the deli items and selection of condiments, spreads, and all other products. The lunch was perfect too, can recommend the Berliner curry wurst and Käsespätzle Looking forward to visit Huber's every time we come to Singapore
3
We shared a hot roast beef sandwich with fries and a couple of beers.It was a good sandwich.This is clearly a decent place for a snack but I have a couple of negatives-it is virtually impossible to eat whilst watching the kids in the playground.-they have a number of wifi routers transmitting yet they will not give you a passcode. Difficult to understand-one of the servers was brusque to the point of very unfriendly. The others were fine
5
Absolutely a bargain with fantastic food and kids playground. Great place for Sunday lunch with family and friends.
5
A must ! Love all their meal, the sausage. Highly recommended the beef burger for beef lover, must eat! Will pay a visit when I'm back in Singapore.
5
The butchery itself is fantastic. From an amazing array of sausages to cheese to meats there is everything a foodie could want - including barbecues, vegetables, marinades, sauces etc.,The butchers ( there are many of them) will help you pick your meat. The meat can be vacuum packed and kept in their freezers till you are ready to pick it up. They even sell ice and cooler bags and the meats can travel up to about 4 hours without defrosting (by air)There is also a really nice restaurant and play area on site. The food is swiss/German but well cooked using the produce from the butchery.
5
This is easily the best butcher in Singapore.They have a superb range including sensational sausages and amazing Norwegian smoked salmon smoked in Singapore.The unique feature is their dry aging cabinet.We dry aged a piece of Aussie rib for the full sixty days and it was the most tender and flavoursome beef I have had in years,certainly unsurpassed in Singapore! Go there and get your beef in that cabinet-it is worth the wait and cost
4
This is of the best place to go for groceries if you're an expatriate or want to look for some good stuff with wide selection of cheese, meat, wine, etc... they import their products and set a standard for it so be prepared to pay for quality stuff. Not overly expensive, I'd say it's an expected price to pay. Just browsing around is interesting. An occasional treat for the average Joe (or a norm for those earning well enough). Opening times are in the photo

I love huber butchery because they have a wide range of products, you can actually buy everything you need and prepare a nice home cook meal for dinner.The staff are helpful and knowledgeable, make choice and selection easy.The meat are fresh and price acceptable.When people said is expensive how much is expensive. They have lovely strawberry tomato a box for $10 really pretty appetizing, you cannot compare with normal tomato. They so fresh when u bit into it and you don't eat everyday so $10 for a family meal is okay.They have free cooking class with very generous sampling, 26/11 they have parma ham appreciate cooking class with chef domince & chef patrick.These chef introduce many useful ingredients for cooking and we learn more about parma ham and pasta. Was a great class and chef patrick was very kind to answer our question show us sample packing of the ingredients use in the class.Guess what? We end up spending $139 after the class buying the ham, meat, dressing to cook what we learn from the class while is still fresh in our mind. what we cannot find Chef Patrick was very kind to show us where they were display. I bought a lovely piece of wagyu ribeye MB 6/7 300gm for $48 for my son in law who love beef. It was very nice and melt in your mouth. He enjoy it very much.Huber butchery is the fresh meat people. Hope they can continued to maintain.Picture from the cooking class
5
The store is a wonderland of gourmet products. I always find myself buying more than I wanted because everything looks so good. Thankful it also taste so good. The meat selection is mind blowing and the quality is top notch. I'm glad they pay attention to the farms they get their meats and most of them and growth hormone free. The service from the butchers is very professional and they are always eager to give cooking advice. The bistro beside the store serves great food at very affordable prices. I hope this store continues its great work as it makes my everyday meals so delicious

Had the aged beef burger today and it was good. Altho I like my burgers a bit thinner and wider, it was a good quality meat that was used. The cheesecake was decent but the biscuit base was soggy. On the upside the beer was very reasonably priced and tasty.The butchers is awesome and contains way more than just meat and poultry. Deli and cheese sections are really good, good wine and beers and a big fruit and veg section are all a nice suprise in SGP.I'd go back but mainly for the shop and not necessarily the restaurant
4
The meat is outstanding and really reasonable. The butchers not only vacuum pack your meat but will also freeze it and have it ready to fly back home with you. They even sell freezer bags and ice at the store. The restaurant has a great family atmosphere especially on the weekend. It's good hearty food and the prices are reasonable. I love this place!!
5
We went once to buy some meat to take back home. The meat was fantastic. Selection was amazing. It is the best place to buy quality meat in Singapore (he place we know of).We also had a meal at the brasserie. The food was excellent. One of the best hamburgers in Singapore. Brilliant Pork Knuckle. Gravy to die for.This really is the meat lovers heaven.
4
Wonderful butchery attached to the restaurant which is a nice quaint quick bite excellent quality sausages. Really nice helpful staff to assist with my search for truffle cheese and great pork sausages.
4
Hubers has a great variety of great cuts and knowledgeable staff. It is our favourite haunt when we want to ensure that we get a good piece of steak.
4
Delicious lunch today at Hubers. Very attentive staff, large portions & reasonable prices (by Singapore standards). Had to wait 20 minutes to get a table but they had us sat under a fan waiting as soon as was possible. Altogether a good experience.
4
enjoyable food where you get fresh sausages and good meat. but service staff is poor and at times condescending.
4
If you are looking for authentic Swiss / European food, the bistro at Huber's Butchery is a good choice. Prices are ok and portions are generous. There is inside and outside seating available. However, the place is not big, be prepared to queue on weekends.

As a vegetarian, I understand that there are some restaurants I am unable to go to. However, I called this restaurant because my family was going there and I wanted to join them. They said they had a variety of options for me that they could make. Upon arriving, we were greeted by a very rude waitress who told me to "just eat the salad" (which by the way had 3 ingredients and was a starter). As well as this, once we finally worked our way around my order, they "forgot" to tell the chef and I never received it. In my opinion, a chef should be able to cater for all customers especially if they tell me they will on the phone. Highly do not recommend.
3
I'm doing the review of the shop rather than the restaurant. Hubers moved a few months ago to much bigger space and as such they have a wider selection of goods. The meat variety is good and there are plenty of groceries to choose from with an emphasis of European brands (good for those expats missing items from home. ).
5
I found Huber's online because I was having pork withdrawal. We are in Desaru, Malaysia so we're a short ferry ride to Singapore. We can't find pork or decent beef here. So I searched google for "bacon" in Singapore. Huber's was returned. The pictures looked like it was a nice place, so we went there on Wednesday, 8-31. We were quite impressed. It smells so clean when you walk in. And it is. The floors are clean, the packaged foods are arranged logically on clean and well-lit shelving. The meats are kept in cooled, brightly lit, clean cases so that the customer can see exactly what he/she is buying. The butchers were very accommodating and helpful. I'm not really familiar with grams as opposed to ounces yet, and the gentleman behind the counter was very kind and glad to help. We bought a chuck roast, 3 packages of bacon, some smoked ham sliced for lunch meat, some frankfurters and some ground beef, as well as a few other items from the well-stocked shelves. We felt the price at $63 SGD was reasonable. I cooked the roast today. OM GOSH! It is tender and delicious. As good as any chuck I could find back in Texas. We've also tried the ham and it is just as scrumptious and sliced exactly as I had requested. Oh, the man slicing the ham sliced a thin piece and asked if I'd like to taste it. You betcha! So he gave me that slice just to taste. Very nice. The store is two stories with two elevators, so no problem getting your basket up or down to the next floor. Huber's also offers frozen foods, dressings, pickles (which I've had a hard time finding in Malaysia too), fresh fruits and veggies. All in all I say again....this is the BEST we've found for fresh beef and pork as well as some cheeses such as Mozarella and sliced Swiss. We did not try the restaurant. This is just a very nice grocer with a very nice assortment, very nice folks working there and we will be back.....soon. Next time we'll try the restaurant! One thing I want to mention. We've had a difficult time finding Taxis in Singapore, and none of the the numbers we've called have ever worked for us. They're either busy or nobody answers. As we were leaving, we asked the cashier to call a cab for us. She called someone in their back office, who called the cab, and we waited about 3 minutes for it to arrive. It had just started to rain, but they have a nice big covered area for folks to wait outside. A great experience all the way around. Thank you, Hubers. You've thought of everything
4
A casual place to go when one needs one's beef without the fancy frills. We had the USDA prime beef. It was perfectly cooked. I alsp had the spatzle as a side, unfortunately it was not cheesy or salty enough
5
Tucked at the back of Huber's Butchery is a small bistro which sit at most 30 person (indoor) and maybe another 20 (outdoor). Maybe cos they they got the best meats (hey, they are the butchery!), the food is real, solid and of quality.I had the onion soup, really flavourful. The Bone in rib, Gigantic portion, soft broiled and only $17! They do not serve ice water but drinks are fairly reasonable (like $4 for a can soda or ice lemon tea). Breads are served when you order a soup. Sourdough was served today which is not my fav but not their fault.Because its not a huge place, staff are alert, friendly and knows the menu very well. Some part of the menu are in German, so I thought explanation in English on the menu would have been friendlier.Overall, great comfortable place! Once you are done eating, go to the Butchery next door, which has the widest cuts of meat you will see, plus a European Supermart and vegetable section as well
4
Good for well kept meat and vegetables - there are plenty of deli treats too that are difficult to find anywhere else in Singapore - so worth a visit
4
Simple and tasty food, with prices well below most restaurants in Dempsey, so clearly a good option.Add to this the playground for kids and the supermarket to do some shopping on the way home and you'll come back there on regular basis.There will often be a queue but the reputation is well deserved
4
The grocery store has a small bistro with a few reasonably priced snacks including a wide range of sausages. We had the dry aged burger and roast beef sandwich both quite good. You can also enjoy Swiss condiments and rivella here in case you enjoy the fermented milk drink.
4
From its common origin with Swiss Butchery, the Hubers have been selling premium meat (raw, cured, cooked) and other imported groceries in Singapore for over 20 years. The product range keeps expanding. Helpful and professional staff. The go-to place for quality food imports. Even vegetarians would be happy here
4
First time visit huber butchery one Saturday morning, very impress with the service, layout, staff attentiveness, products experience and friendliness.Prices wise is reasonable, product range is good love this outlet. Staff helpful, they even have station to sample food which we can try before purchase.Will go back again if need any grocery
4
We had already eaten here before and given the good experience before, we tried it again as we were going to the butchery anyway to buy our meat. Again a fine meal, nothing to complain about. Very good value for money, probably one of the best value for money when it comes to meat dishes in Singapore. You can easily pay 2x or 3x for the same steak in more fancy places. One we will visit again in the future.

We had dinner at the Bistro last Friday while it was raining. They recently moved to a new building and while its was raining, the water simply comes flowing onto the terrace and a bit into the restaurant. Three guys had to continuously fight to get the water out of the restaurant but they couldn't prevent it from flowing onto the terrace. The design of the new place is so poor and unprofessional it's just mindblowing. Simply un-be-lie-va-ble because they will have this each and every time it rains hard. And that tends to happen from time to time in Singapore... Still, we found ourselves a table inside and the food was good to very good. The speed at which we got our food was record setting, very quick, which is the way we liked it as we still had some shopping to do next door. The staff were very helpful and friendly as well. So with good food and friendly people, I still give them a 4/5, but the water issue is something they will have to deal with because you just can't keep running a place like that. The architect must have been dreaming while he made the plans for the new place
4
I made the poorly-timed decision to try Huber's Bistro for lunch this past Sunday. We arrived at 11:58 am and stood in a line that wasn't very long, but because the dining area is not very large, we waited 28 minutes to get a table in the outdoor seating area. The place where the queue is located has limited shade, although it looks like they're trying to grow some vines to provide more shade there. Bring a sun umbrella and fans to use while you wait. I never went inside the very small indoor, air conditioned dining room, but from peeking in the windows, I only saw 3 tables in there. Where we were sitting outdoors was shaded, but the fans didn't quite reach us. The heat was stifling and really impacted our ability to enjoy our meal. I had the "warm roast beef sandwich" although it wasn't very warm. It was good enough, but I would probably try something different next time. My husband had the honey baked ham with mashed potatoes. He enjoyed it. The most impressive thing to me was how reasonably priced their menu is. We were 2 adults and we each ordered a main, we each had 2 soft drinks due to the intense heat, and my husband ordered some soup which came with a bread roll and our bill came to just under $57.The store upstairs was really impressive; it actually has 2 levels. All sorts of things from meats, sausages, crab meat, frozen soups to wine, fresh produce, jellies, etc. They had jars of "Singapore Sling" flavored marmalade by Straits Preserves that I thought would be a nice "Singapore" gift for visitors

Excellent quality butchery with real value for money products .. You name it they have it!! From raw sausages, smoked meats, cold cuts, marinated ribs to organic meats ! What more could you want. And complimenting that they have great accompaniments and cheeses, and a wide selection of exotic beers and fine wines! A feast in the making each time you visit.The staff are extremely helpful and friendly and makes one want to shop and stay longer.I am yet to try their bistro .. But the surrounding play area and garden looks lovely for children! Huber's a must visit if you are in the neighbourhood!!

Love the new location of Hubers.Great food and price at the outdoor cafe , quality of meat in shop second to none in Singapore.The playground is new,in shade and a really nice space.The only thing that would be great is to put a few more chairs,benches up outside NEXT to playground. there is still lots of outdoor space and hopefully that gets put to use
4
Good variety of Swiss and / or German food, fast and friendly service, casual atmosphere. Portion size is okay.
5
Affordable with quality products..
All meat products are available here.
Happy with all the smiling staff and friendly approach with customer

Way to go if your looking for a good steak, tbone orange other cut u can imagine. They r very helpful and have a good selection of various meat.

Ordered a sandwich and a beer. And asked for a glass of plain tap water which the waitress denied me. Can we not be expected to have a glass of water with our meals? Are we obligated to buy overpriced bottled water that we know destroys the environment, and contributes to greenhouse warming through the unnecessary waste of energy involved in bottling water amongst its other environmenta

Huber’s Bistro @ Dempsey was officially reopened in late October 2015. They are now relocated at 22 Dempsey Road from 18A Dempsey Road.We went there in the evening for dinner and shared the following between three of us:Seafood Chowder. Good amount of chopped up seafood in a creamy soup, served warm and with slices of bread. Huber’s Beef Burger. The 100% pure Australian chilled beef was served with crispy bacon with Gruyere cheese and caramelized onions between a sesame seed bun. Generous amount of french fries. A more or less standard burger.Smoked Duck Breast Salad: Fresh greens with slices of juicy and tender duck breast meat.Tossed with freshly chopped onions giving a crunch, in a Baerg Marit Blueberry balsamic vinaigrette. The duck meat was lean. Would have liked some nuts in the salad.Braised Grain-fed Bone-in-Beef Short Rib: Well braised and marinated. The meat falls off the bone. Had an outer layer of slightly crispy smoky textured meat. Good amount of mashed potato with the caramelized onions and some horse radish.All the food came very quickly. Service was attentive, polite and friendly. Waiter alerted us that they ran out of the Eisbein boiled pork knuckle and the1/2 roasted chicken when we sat down. Noted the container for wet umbrellas and the magazine rack next to the door to the air-conditioned enclosure.Average cost per person before gst and service charge: $20.00Wine: 3 reds and 3 whites offered by the glass, and other selected wines served by the bottle. They stock and serve Weissbier beers and other Non-alcoholic beers. A range of coffee and tea drinks; ciders and ginger ales.Must return to try their sausages, pork knuckle and the 1/2 roasted chicken. Free ample parking.No WiFi.No ramp for wheel chair.But they can carry the wheel chair up/down if there’s one. Child friendly with lots of space for playing around.Toilets outside to the right of the Bistro.Small air-conditioned area and a slightly larger area outside for dining which has a snack-shop-like ambiance. Can be pretty warm during the day and afternoon in spite of the fans, but not bad in the evenings. Good place to chill out with friends and beer in the evenings.There’s a breakfast menu which is reasonably priced.Huber’s Bistro @ Dempsey.22 Dempsey RoadSingapore 249679Tel: +65 6737 1488.Opens at 9.30 am to 10 pm

Visited this place for the 2nd time today, but this time at their newly located space. Nice playground for kids! The restaurant is really quite small, and the air-conditioned space is really just too small.. the rest of the tables were situated outside, which is more like a tentage. The lunch time heat is really too hot to enjoy your meal comfortably (and the sun does get into the sides of the restaurant. Despite the blowing fans, get ready to perspire ("what about waiting for a table in the air-conditioned space" you say? Well, you'll have to wait quite a while especially on weekends. The food on the other hand was pretty decent. We had the Roast Beef sandwich and Curry Wurst. The food quality was good and came with generous portions. Afterwards, you can drop by the butchery where you can get some really good meat for cooking or bbq

We had a quick dinner here tonight. Ordered the Short ribs and the Dry Aged burger. Short ribs: tender and moist. Cooked to perfectionDry Aged Burger: beef was exceedingly flavorful and paired very well with the caramelised onions and grilled tomato. The Bistro is well laid out in relation to the Butchery and the whole shop is totally child friendly with an outdoor play area whilst parents sho

Really enjoyed going here for a quick meal with the family. The cafe is simply set up with ok service (newly opened so understand how the staff seem flustered). Food came out in a timely manner and was surprisingly on the larger side of portions, great to see!! The braised short ribs were excellent, hamburger nice (ask if you prefer it well done) and beef sandwich tasty.Kids really enjoyed the playground and nice to see the thought of young families when planning the layout. Would have been nice to have a changing space in the restroom but that is being picky.Shop is a step up from old location with both levels well layed out and full of great produce.We will be back for sure

I'm in Huber's Dempsey about every 10 days, or so, stocking up on lots of organic, grass-fed ribeye, tenderloin and ground beef. The people working behind the meat counter are friendly and always happy to cut and individually vacuum pack my meats. In fact, all the staff are smiling and have been consistently helpful month after month, year after year. I also like their in-house (Pandan loop factory) made sausages and bacon. While you're there check out their tasty, premium imported olive oils and unpasteurized cheeses. There's a few other things that I like to buy at Huber's but they are always in short supply so I'm not going to mention them to avoid them being sold out the next time I go;) My only complaint about Huber's is that while most items are reasonably priced their line caught wild caught Alaskan salmon steaks run >S$30/piece which, in my opinion, means they should really taste fantastic...but they don't. To be fair, I am comparing them to the line-caught, wild salmon I used to buy and grill when I lived in the U.S. They would melt in your mouth, versus these frozen steaks that seem tough and dried out no matter how you cook them. Considering that Huber's is first and foremost a butcher shop and not a fish market, this really isn't a big deal. If you want something that's melt in your good, talk to the butchers and get a great steak!

I ate Australian grass fed steak in lunch time at the patio garden.
That's so healthy and excellent taste.
You can choose meat from showcase in the store.
There is many kind of beef.
Wa-gyu also.

You probably don't think impeccable service is key to business growth and sustainability... Well - think again...

Was thrilled to discover this butcher. Very knowledgeable and helpful staff with an excellent selection of meats and cuts. I was prepared for astronomical prices but was pleasantly surprised. Hubers is my go-to place for meat and accompaniments. Would like to go back for brunch or just enjoy a beer outside on their patio

It was first time I brought mum and my relatives to Huber at Dempsey. It was known for its great food and beer. We ordered Schneider Wiesse beer and a chocolate cake. Beer was ice cold and refreshing. Chocolate cake was yummylicious. You can taste the fragrance of the dark chocolate. Generally it would taste very sweet but this is not. Service is excellent and I would recommend Huber for a great place to chill on a hot afternoon

There are a few good things about this place - the meat is pretty good quality and we did not have to wait long. However, it seems like it is under poor management. The service is lax, too many servers running around and yet no one notices that you need something, or asks to see if you have been put on the queue to be seated. There is no ice water. In singapore this is absurd, since you can drink straight from the tap - very different, say, from mainland China where you cannot. Not having ice water means they want to charge you for water. Which means they are trying to scrimp and save on little things and charge for things that should otherwise be free. And it shows. The fries are old and stale. The iced latte was big enough to have two shots of espresso but only had one - weak coffee is not worth drinking! Won't come back!

Consider this: at Hubers you can choose any non-marinated meat and get them to cook it for you at 40% extra cost. The meat is fresh and super prime cut. A typical rib eye would cost about $25 ($40 elsewhere), a proper veal shank $70 ($150 elsewhere). Serves with sides that you can customize, eg mash and salad, or only salads (it's a lot of meat). Then there's ice cold beer, wine, and other drinks. The setting is alfresco, no aircon, but it's breezy. They charge less premium price after all. Great for breakfast/brunch as well.

Hubers is a top class butchers and grocery store in dempsey hill. The selection of fresh and cured meats is one of the best in Singapore. Every time I go I always watch in envy at the people sitting at the handful of tables outside eating and drinking during a lazy lunch. This last visit we stopped to enjoy the food which, given the price ($90 for 3 adults and 2 kids) was excellent. They have octoberfest specials on right now and we enjoyed a plate of different Germany sausages, sauerkraut and potatoes salad. All the sausages were very tasty and all available in store also to take home. The kids shared a burger which was sooo tasty I almost ordered another one. They have a variety of blonde and weiss beers on tap which were really good. This is an excellent place for a laid back lunch before or after doing your groceries. The selection is authentic german and Swiss and cooked very well.

The beef mid ribs in the cafe menu is the star of all the selections. It was done just right, soft and tender and packing full of flavor. The rest of the menu is good too. Overall the quality and price ratio is good; no service charge too.

Been shopping and breakfasting/lunching at Hubers for last 3 years and went again on Sunday with family. Given the popularity of this place (we waited 30 mins for table) I am very surprised there are so few reviews in trip adviser. What you get here is a good reliable breakfast/lunch for a very good price. The specialities of course are meat oriented and there a few good beers to try if that is your thing. If super hungry the burger is a great bet and there are always a few specials on offer and salads. There are several sausage dishes with sauerkraut and as such you may frequently hear the occasional German accent or two. This is not fine dining but a great place for a casual outdoors lunches with no pretentions and very family friendly

Service staff charged $25 for a sausage and if you don't check your bills, you will be in for an expensive bite....This purchase went through a service staff and a cashier but both Huber's staff had let this error slip pass them....Have a go at calling back for error rectification with Huber and service recovery.... It only gets more frustrating ...
