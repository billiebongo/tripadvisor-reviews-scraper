The atmosphere was pleasant but most importantly the food is pretty darn good. Haleem with some roti is heavenly.
2
There are many more better options for indian food in Singapore. The food and service are subpar now in what was once an amazing indian restaurant.
5
The food was delicious, the atmosphere soothing and the service was impeccable. We didn‚Äôt opt for the buffet but went ala carte. Portion sizes are a little small and every dish left us feeling there were a little more...

We went for a Sunday buffet to this restaurant, even before we sat down, the waiter told us that the buffet closes at 2.45 pm. The buffet presentation desired a lot more to be done. Service was very poor and so was the quality of food. The staff was not replenishing the buffet, they had to be literally coaxed. The charge of 52 SGD per person plus taxes does not get justified at all.. it was an extremely poor experience
5
The restaurant was almost empty when we ate here but the food was really excellent - and service was great. We are not Indian food aficionados so needed help understanding some items on the menu. The staff was very kind and understanding and made it easy for us to choose what we thought we'd like.

At 52 SD a person, the lunch buffet is definitely overpriced, but the good thing is that they did not charge for the two small kids who were with us. The snacks such as Paani Puri aka Golgappas aka Puchkas were quite tasty with their presentation in a fibre plate; the Pav-Bhaji were better than the main fare. In the main dishes, the mutton biryani was outstanding but the channa were poorly cooked. The service for the serving of the Rotis was a tad slow, so had to content ourselves with more rice. The sweets consisited of only Gulabjamun and a vanilla/chocolate ice cream. It should have had more options

I had been to this restaurant for lunch on 18-01-2018 with my grandchildren. The vegetarian spread (I am a vegetarian) consisted of two starters and three curries and a dal. Vegetable pulao and white rice were available. The soup counter had small thimble sized cups to take the soup. The pleasure of having the soup was lost at the sight of these thimble sized cups. It would not be out of place to say that the soup was cold. The last few pieces of a starter were left in the bowl. It took a decent time to get refills. The other dishes were cold, despite being on a heater. The first set of roti and naan were served at the table. A request for the refill, two reminders and 15 minutes later, our group moved to the desserts without getting the roti on to the table.The desserts I must admit, were the only item one could really enjoy. Such a poor selection of spread combined with total absence of service is the theme of this restaurant. Would I venture to this place again NO. Would I recommend this place NO

I had high expectations of the meal from this restaurant as it is associated with one of the top names of a gentleman from Culinary brigade in India.The whole operation is not coordinated well enough. From the time you have to wait before someone attends to you on the table to no one paying heed to explain the concept are the concerns .It would be nice to explain the concept of thali and what the promotion is all about. I had an Italian Guest with me who was inquisitive about lot of things but unfortunately no explanation.Food is not bad. But the whole experience is missing. I am sure the Thali promotion can be much better executed

I've been here two times, the first time which was a working lunch, it was an open buffet and quality of food and price was very good so that's why I decided to bring my family and relatives to this place for a nice dinner....how ever they do not offer open buffet for dinner and the service we have received for a $600-dinner here was awful, food was cold and waiters/waitresses were so slow. You could have better Indian food even in local/ low-grade outlets. This place is a fancy place and the food portion is too small. The worst part is they being slow!...They served the plain rice first and after 20 minutes, the first main dish came in...it took them another 20 minutes to bring the 2nd main dish and so on...! Food portion was sooo small and we needed to order more and more. It was a very bad experience. I regret to bring my family to such a place. Finally, the damage was $600 for 8 pax (including 3 kids)

I visited Yantra second time. Both occasions with my Wife. When I visited first time we ordered ala carte through menu options and food was awesome especially dal makani and chat items.Second time I again visited with Wife but this time for new year eve and buffet was very good especially starters chat items. Deserts were also good but only disappointing was main course. Overall experience was good.I would suggest ala carte from menu options rather than buffet.Overall I would say this is one of the best and costliest Indian restaurant in Singapore

Nice quiet place to catch up with friends over the Indian buffet. Spread was not very fantastic but the food was good. Maybe could have more desserts or more varieties of salads.
5
Our first time at Yantra. Excellent food with fine ingredients and cooking techniques.
We love all the food we ordered and were surprised by the sharing portion.
Will be back again with our friends.
Thank you Yantra team for the wonderful evening.
5
This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore. How it does not have a Michelin star is beyond me. The food, the service, the ambience is all excellent. The food quality is also excellent. Definitely a place to visit.
5
Excellent food, great place to visit with family. The best Indian restaurant in Singapore. The dal and paneer was üëç

Food is respectable but place is too noisy. There is echo and u can‚Äôt hear each other. Tables too close to each other. Go for food only

Yantra has a good vibe, the decor is upscale, service good and food presentation superb. When it came to the food, I loved some, yet others were just...meh! Maybe it had something to do with the creamy base of several of the dishes! After the buffet lunch it feels like a brick in your stomach. But I must say that the lesser creamy dishes, the chhole daal, the appetizers like pani puri etc,, those were delicious! On the whole I loved the experience of the lunch, more than the lunch itself! Perhaps indian cuisine is heavy, and that's how it should be cooked --- but for a great chef, being innovative to keep up with the times of healthier yet slurpilicious creations, is not too much of a stretch goal, is it?
2
Went for a business dinner with customers and chose the set course mealFood was below average standards - paneer had an awkward taste - checked with the staff if it was a soy paneer but they advised it was a normal oneOnly dish saving the name was mango kulfi - rest of the meal was below averageAnd if you consider the price you feel cheated. Service was also patheticBetter food available at probably half the priceDo not recommen

I have been for a business lunch in this restaurant with an Indian friend and some partners living in Singapore .Today they only offered Buffet , so I cannot rate the complete Menu but I had the chance to taste a lot of different dishes both vegetarian and not . Everything was freshly cooked , full of exciting flavours , not too hot , even though I like spicy food .Environment is elegant and service was excellent . I have been only a few times to India, several times in Indian restaurants in Europe , but the Food I had was surely one of the best I got

Reservation is a must- restaurant is sometimes closed for private events. They offer buffet for lunch and a la carte/ set menu for dinner. Lunch buffet is great especially on weekends where they have a chat counter. Dinner food is average and is not recommended. Service at times is slow so order your bread basket for lunch buffet accordingly. Interiors are nice however the place can be noisy at times
5
We went for a Saturday buffet. The layout was nice, very comfortable seats and good friendly staff.The buffet itself was wonderful and plentiful. Each dish was cooked to perfection (I tried them all) and the balance of flavours was a masterclass.At $120 for 2 it was not cheap, but the quality of food made it very worthwhile.
4
Good food, some items were different. Nice ambience. Will visit again. There is a big collection of wines to complement the food.
3
Had a business dinner of 8 recently. Appetizers were good, but the main course chicken dish was disappointing as the meat looked like turkey. Bring used to great London Indian restaurants that was a let down. Good choice of wines. Good service. Will try again...

We booked on a Friday evening for the north east indian food menu. When we arrived, it was roughly half full but there was no maitre d to escort us to our table but he came shortly. Then we were made to wait till we were even handed our menus . The place was not understaffed ( there were about 10-12 waiters) but either they were not interested or not trained. Either way, didn't say much about the place. The same was the case with our bill . The place also eventually got so raucous and noisy thus almost making the fine dining ambience a joke.About the foodIt was really average and I think a 40 % premium over what it really was worth . We ordered the north east indian prawn starters ( for nearly 40 $) but all it tasted was of steamed prawns. The chicken tikka was soft but had no tandoor flavour at all making me suspect if it was indeed even cooked in a tandoor. The lamb biryani was OK but no where as flavourful to what a real dum biryani should be ( try the one at Punjab Grill). They tried to make it up by giving us a complimentary kulfi which made matters worse because it was completely tasteless and akin to sucking on cardboard ..my 10 year old did not want to finish it which should tell you something.In sum, the ambience was noisy, service was bad and the food was average and this place certainly does not deserve it's premium rating.I would not be visiting this place again for sure

We visited on a Sunday evening for the dinner buffet. The food was average. Previously street food starters were available. What was most disappointing was that we were charged a different price from their website. I only realised this once we arrived home. I called to query this and was informed that it was an old promotion. Apparently from last year! If that's the case their website is outdated by a year. This is false advertising. The waitress refused to serve us ice water. We insisted and eventually she did. If you only serve bottled water then state it. Consumers have a right to make an informed choice and on this visit we weren't given one. To make matters worse, we asked friends to join us and we told them they would pay advertised prices. Waited 20 minutes for the bill

Yantra was always a significant name of the Singapore Indian restaurants however, the restaurant has makes a marked difference after the new management takeover. Not only has the food quality has made a huge improvement; the restaurant has moved away from the curry / balti based dishes where all dishes taste same. Chef Pinaki has successfully created a niche by venturing into the lesser trodden path to bring the regional dishes and family recipes in the offing. Yantra is the only place that one can get the obscure Dokar Dalna from the kitchens of Bengal , authentic Hyderbadi Biriyani and temple good of the south. Chef Pinaki√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s diverse experience shows in the variety of traditional and fusion dishes on the offer...I was completely blown away by the gulab jamun tiramisu. At lunch they have a buffet which offers both popular Indian dishes and experimental ones. They occasionally have themed buffets which are something to look forward to. The dishes are well researched and well executed. Dinner is ala-carte and extensive.The service, decor and wine list makes the experience truly fine dining. Yantra is my go to place for Indian cuisine... they never fail to impres

We visited twice, once for the lunch buffet and once for dinner. The lunch buffet was pretty good and had a wide spread. However, having dinner at Yantra turned out to be a bad decision. The food itself was quite decent, and the menu had some interesting choices. It was the service which let us down completely. We had to wait a long time to even be able to order. Seemed like only one guy could take the order while the rest of the staff just cleared plates. After starters, took more than 15 mins for someone to clear our plates and take our order for mains. The same repeated while we waited for our desserts - 15 min of wait, and no dessert. In fact I am writing this as I wait for my dessert. This was when the restaurant wasn't even 100% full. Considering it was a Saturday night, the restaurant should have been better prepared. I will not be coming back
2
We booked for a special dinner on a Thursday night. They didn't tell us that there's a private party in a part of the restaurant so we dealt with 'hello hello mike check' most of the evening, waiters gave us hardly any attention. The owners walked around us making absolutely no attempt to acknowledge our misery. And the food was very average for the price
2
There is no doubt the food at Yantra is very good. We had a great meal that was totally ruined by a private party. They were put in a different section but there is no partition so you could hear all the noise. Every few minutes we heard 'testing testing' through the microphone, very annoying. Then some lady singing, which we just wrote off to background music. Finally the private party all come in for dinner and sit right beside us, a big long table of 20 or so. People walking all over the place, and a photographer that hovers back and forth looking for the perfect picture. Then the ultimate in selfishness: the restaurant turns up the lights to full so they can take pictures with enough light! Twice!! The part I love is the owner, who doesn't care and just makes sure his one big table is happy. As do all the waiters who had disappeared from our table.This was one of the strangest nights I have ever had going out to eat, thank you for ruining our night
5
Very artfully presented and very tasty. Lively ambiance. Attentive service. The menu has many choices, one for just about every palate. We have eaten there twice and intend to return. A bit on the pricey side but worth the extra money. All food is cooked from scratch
2
Well received at the reception lobby; excellent ambience. But lunch buffet was low in quantity and quality; which is not expected from such a fine dining restaurant. There were just 2 spartan veg starters (both had seen better days & wouldn't be surprised if they were carry overs from previous day); and 2 underwhelming non-veg starters. Just 1 veg curry, and 2 other disappointing veg dishes. 1 chicken & prawn curry with chicken undercooked. The 2-3 desserts were underwhelming. Service was slow. No one to assist at the buffet spread; and a few of the food containers stayed empty and the wait staff had to be reminded by several guests for top ups. We haven't tried their a la carte offerings; maybe these are better. But we definitely will not be returning for the buffet/ brunch
5
Always very well done...have been to the lunch buffet several times now and never leave disppponted. The manager and Chef check on us regularly, food consistently exceeds expectations. Will certainly return!
5
Yantra is a lovely place for fine dining and has some wonderfully crafted Indian dishes. They have a great spread of in their buffet and taste is very authentic. The service is good and the staff are attentive to the clients needs. If you are looking for a place to have Indian food for a special occasion I would definitely recommend Yantra
4
i've been to yantra a few times for lunch and dinner and the food is consistently good. the lunch buffet is a good deal. dinner is a la carte (they have a weekend buffet that i haven't tried) and prices are what you would expect of an upmarket indian restaurant in an upmarket mall (tanglin mall - very nice) OTHER than tandoori avocado (the very idea should have been enough of a deterrent to ordering but more fool i). bad enough that this is a silly little, incongruous creation but SGD32 for four little slivers of hot avocado with a paste (clearly intended by god for chicken) that slides right off the avocado leaving you with a $8 sliver of hot avocado? really chef hemant!! won't stop me from returning to yantra but i'll certainly stick with tried and trusted old favourites such as chicken biryani, palak paneer and such like. lovely servers and nice ambience although the night i went the restaurant was startlingly full of very loud men. tanglin mall is centrally located and posh. this is one of my more favourite indian restaurants in town slimy pear and loud men notwithstanding
5
Yantra is my favorite restaurant in Singapore. We visit it for all major occasions like anniversaries and birthdays. The best part about this restaurant is the nice ambience and great starters. I am a vegetarian, but still I find very good starters. And non-vegetarians can even enjoy better
3
The service is impeccable, attentive and on point. I had the entertainer app and even with get one entree and have the other free it was expensive. $10 for garlic nan and $12 for basmati rice? Come on, even for fine dining that is quite ridiculous. The butter chicken was ok. Three Crab pao on small pieces of toast for approximate $30 is also quite outrageous. I have been to Nuevo Indian restaurants which have been fabulous but not this one. I was actually quite disappointed with the food which was somewhat made up by the service.
5
Best place to fine dine some North Indian Delicacies in best of their presentations and tastes. Ambience is nice and modern, food presentation is nice, authentic taste. Staff is good and helpful. I have visited this place several times and has never been disappointed with food. The cost is bit on higher side, but yes fine dine experience is worth the taste of food.

Was looking forward to this a lot but ended up being an average experience.Restaurant itself is beautiful, spacious and i like how the food is off to the side in another room so youre not looking at lines of people clamouring for food while you eat.Starters - we tried some fried pakodas but they were hard , like they had been cooked too long ago. - Chicken tikka (my favourite) was tasty but it was cold in the warmer!! Now i really know food had been cooked long ago. Actually i went back later and there was warm/hot chicken tikka added on the top of the colder pieces below.Was hoping they had lamb shish kebab but they didnt they had some other type of lamb in a semi curry thingMains - Only 2 meat curries which was disappointing - a mild chicken one (quite average) and a lamb keema one (very nice). - There was a prawn curry which was excellent but i dont eat prawns, my partner told me it was good.- Dahl was good, the other veg curries were average.- Fresh naans and breads made to order and brought to your table. Took a little too long but they were a bit busyDessert - small selection but gulab jamun was good , just a touch too sweet for me as drenched in a lot of syrup. The ice cream station was popular but again the sweetness of the ice cream too much for meWarning buffet price (expensive over $60 per head) DOES NOT include drinks other than tap water, not even soft drink. So add onto the price whatever you want for drinks.Personally I would not go back for buffet, but maybe for a la carte I might give it another g

We had a great evening and absolutely loved the hospitality  The evening started with some aperitifs on the house Small tidbits that were quite tasty Each dish was excellentEsp the black dal The bhindi And the chicken malai kebabAnother must try is the chicken bharta The mutton preparation was soft and delectable Strongly recommended

went with my family to Yantra after 2 years and really have to say I was disappointed. It's not the same Yantra anymore what it was many years back. The service was poor. Grill avocado, peanut kebabs and chaat were ok. The internet wifi was not working. Buttermilk and cranberry juice were ok. In main course yellow dal and palak paneer were gud,but the mixed veg and the paneer were ok. Also I don't find the logic of paying 560 sgd for all these meals which excludes drinks and desserts. The decor is gud. Also the restaurant appeared to be empty which is unusual given today being a weekend. It's very expensive according to me and one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore. Also I think that the restaurant standards have fallen. Overall an unforgettable experienc
5
Nice place and great ambiance. I had lunch buffet for $33 and the buffet is great tasting food and served with elegance. Options are many and love pretty much every dish I ate. I went there was business but I say it's a great for any kind of meeting, date etc.If you are craving indian in Singapore this is a place to go
5
Fantastic experience. The Chef was most accommodating with our requests. Service staff were very very helpful and went out of their way to ensure the comfort of guests. Great food and fantastic service.
5
Amazing Ambiance and Great food, Innovative presentation and food choices from Chair Chat to Avacado. Great service oriented staff! We wanted food without Onion and Garlic and they promptly obliged! Great Taste and wonderful experience
5
While admittedly expensive, this stunningly tastefully decorated Indian restaurant in Singapore was the best Indian meal I have ever had! The decor was calming, soothing, the attentive staff were superb but the q u ality of the food was outstandingüòã
5
Worth a visit if you want to have quality Indian food in Singapore. It's a mix of tradition with modern menu items and has great vegetarian options: definitely try the eggplant dish. Two thumbs up.
4
This is a modern minimalist decor restaurant - very stylish with attentive staff. Four of us had the evening buffet for S$28 each with a glass of "free wine". the foos was delicious and 3 of us went back for seconds. Well worth a visit if you are in the Tanglin area.
3
As always the god was amazing, but we were here on a Wednesday night. The place was quite empty and then folks left, which meant we were the last there. We were in a deep conversation when it became apparent they wanted us out, indeed the bill was presented without our asking for it. Left feeling hassled, full, satisfied we had eaten well and a bit angry!
4
We went for the buffet option and we do not regret it. Conveniently located with a soothing ambiance, I instantly took a liking for this place. The buffet was sumptuous. I am a dessert freak and their pineapple sheera was outstanding. Friendly staff too...all in all had a pleasant experience
3
Held a lot of promise as it is a Hemant Oberoi restaurant, however, the food was underwhelming, to say the least. Order a bunch of starters, meat dishes and dessert and not one appetiser or main dish was "wow". The pricing is quite steep, so was expecting something great... very average!Desserts were the saving grace - Not too sweet and well presente
5
The food took 1.5h to be served - I think they forgot our order despite us reminding the wait staff twice to check. They tried to rectify our dining experience by providing us with free appetizers but we still ended up late for our show. Food was good but expensive, very frustrating dining experience.
4
This is a contemporary restaurant, presenting traditional Indian dishes in contemporary fashions. Imagine going to a French Restaurant, but the creations being presented the Indian way. For traditionalists they may find the traditional ways more palatable. The place is great for weight conscious patrons as portions are non Indian, petitely apportioned. It is great for the nouveau riche. It is not pure coincidence that the way to make Indian restaurants exclusive is to charge top end prices, the setting elegant and fashionable and an accompanying wine list.  It is certainly not a place for hearty Indian meals, the dinner in particular. The Restaurant serves Buffet for lunch which may well fit the concept of giving opportunity to do Indian food testing in petit portions
5
Being a vegetarian, i always have limited options in Singapore, specially in near Orchard Road. This place is simply awesome, with good quality and tasty food. I would recommend it highly for all. Enjoyed every bite !
5
Enjoyed everything! Food was prepared with high standard. Beautiful restaurant. Like an arts gallery!
5
Being a vegetarian i had limited options in Singapore but after visiting this restaurant, my view had changed. This place provided best Indian food in Singapore. The chair chat was something very unique that i liked.
5
Had a chance to sample their weekend buffet and the selection was quite good. The food wasn't oily and tasted quite good.
Definitely a redo

Being an old TATA hand who had seen up close in Mumbai what stamp Hemant Oberoi had left on the famous Taj Group of hotels, I was keen to try out how things had shaped up post retirement for him in Singapore! From the moment I stepped in to Yantra, with my wife, son & his family resident in Singapore, I sensed we were onto something 'special'! How very true the initial impression turned out at the weekend buffet we tried out. The spacious setting with ample room between tables, the courteous waiters, the dim classy lighting...everything promised just that- Special! We tried a variety of dishes- the Chaat Corner offerings of Dry Bhel, Paapdi Chat & Paani Poori served in boat-shaped dishes resembling leaves, lasooni palak with corn, roasted aloo, daal makhani, vegetable biryani etc etc. Naan, Roti etc were served at our table. Each dish was authentic in taste urging us to march back for multiple helpings! The dessert range was no less impressive with juicy gulab jamuns, kulfi on stick & chocolate ice cream. All told a sumptuous North Indian feast I would recommend for lovers of authentic Indian fare in Singaporea
5
sunday lunch buffet at Yantra is hands down the best on offer in Singapore. Beautifully presented shots for lassi, phirni and dahi bhalla.Their chat counter and pao bhaji was pretty good too. It's one thing to have variety and another to have taste, and Yantra shines in both departments. Kudos to the Chef and his team!
5
A very soberly decorated dining place in Tangling mall where you have buffet lunches and a la carte dinner.The lunch was a nice spread with choice of veg and non vegetarian dishes and a number of salads and desserts. Every item tasted good and the friendly staff really made the outing worth it. Would definitely recommend this place
1
Me and my husband went to this restaurant with decent expectations - not over the top expectations.When we entered, there was nobody to seat us at the tables. There was a lady at the reception, who saw us, didn't even pass a smile, just ignored us. We waited for sometime, so that somebody comes and guides us. Finally, a gentleman came up to us and asked us to be seated.Service - the waiters were just plain confused. They did not know which table what food was ordered. On our table, and the 2 tables next to us, they served the wrong orders. And the best part, when they finally served the right dishes, there was another waiter on the side, telling them the name of the dish so that they could tell us what it was.Food taste - to be honest, it felt like prepackaged food. It might not be, they might have made it fresh, but the taste was totally like that. There was nothing great about the paneer, the dal or the kulcha / naan. Honestly, Shivsagar in Singapore serves better food.All in all, a below avg experience.And my stomach didn't take the food well either
3
Went in as a group of 12 colleagues. Being the Indian in the group I had to order. Asked the staff as well as I didn't know the size of the helpings. Frankly, we ended up with large size of helpings and ended up wasting food.The Chicken tandoori was excellent, but the other starters like Galouti Kebab and Paneer starter were tasteless and nothing to write home about.The food came in and turned out to be extremely rich and didn't appear too healthy.I just hope Hemant Oberoi tests out what's being served here once in a while
3
We went to singapore and had pre booked a table for our 25th wedding anniversary dinner at Tantra.The restaurant had nice ambience. We ordered our starters. My husband's starter came way before mine. I just sat there waiting for my starter while my husband's starter went cold. The starter arrived and I must say grilled avocado's were nice. I ordered their signature daal "langgar wali daal" but got served daal tarka instead which was a dampner on The whole meal.Overall no complaints about flavours but at the price we paid for our meal (¬£¬£¬£¬£), the mix up of order and the waiting time was unacceptable considering the restaurant was nearly empty
5
The buffet was great with many different dishes. Relaxed atmosphere and really great place for lunches. Service was a little slow but I have been there before and it was better.
5
A lovely set up. We went for the Sunday Buffet. The Chats and Baji's were done fresh and the served the naans to the table when they observed is going for the mains. A really lovely touch was the mango kulfee as an ice popsicle.
5
I wasn't a fan of food that adds a lot of spice but the food here is surprisingly good.
It's a bit on the high end but definitely worth a try.
1
Worst experience in this restaurant on a Saturday evening. This is the first time I have experienced such a horrible service. Although the food was good but that's not enough to justify to what we paid. Was served appetizers and main course at the same time. While having mains the service staff keep bugging for desserts... no patience at all with the service staff ... I just want to bring into your notice, sir we can get good food outside too but what makes the difference is the service. This is for sure that we will never ever step in yantra anymore. My sincere feedback to look into your service practice
3
I used to be a big fan of Yantra. But the last time I went there with friends, i came away disappointed. The service was not as promt and friendly as it used to be. The buffet wasn't replenished fast enough. And when it was I found it lacking the usual taste
2
I have visited this restaurant just a couple times in my 5 years of expat living in Singapore.The new furnishing and interiors are similar to a fine dining place but the food or service doesn't really live up to standards.I went with my son, aged 24 who kept complaining about the food quality as he has tried some of the best indian restaurants around the globe. I kept justifying until I bit into the naan and found a long strand of hair. I showed the hair to the manager who just ignored and never showed up even for a mere apology. Not to mention, I ended up paying 110 dollars for a meal which we ended in 40 mins to rush home and promise each other we wouldn't return again.

Food - 4*Service - 5*Ambience - 4*My first visit to Yantra today was with family for the Saturday brunch buffet.. Having heard good reviews about the food (not so much about the service) we went there looking for good non-veg and vegetarian fare.... Making a reservation was easy and so was locating it at level 1... It wasn't buzzing with people but almost all tables were occupied at around 145.. The buffet was in a room separate from the seating which seems like a good idea.. Starters were not much.. The chart station had decent panipuri...The main buffet fare scored excellently well in the non-veg dept... Yakhni pulao, saal gosht, chicken tikka masala and the other kebabs were great!... The veg fare of matki daal, nizami handi, broccoli and moong daal kebabs, kadhi were an average fare (could be better).... The desserts scored high marks again... Jalebi, kulfi, lagani custard were super... Rasmalai was ok...The restaurant manager spent some with us arranging for the anniversary cake with a candle (thank you so much!) and gave a little history of the restaurant to us.. He was wonderful and wish him best of luck in his restauranting future... The service was really good... Especially the girls!... What we need as customers is to be noticed when we want attention and get serviced quick.. The girls were on their toes and caught our eye whenever we needed anything.. Really, their hard work and work with a smile is something most of singapore restaurants need desperately!!!!!!While wifey was not impressed with the ambience, I liked it very much!Welll done Yantra!!!

Had heard lots of great things about Yantra and we finally decided to go on my husband's birthday. Great ambience and service. The food itself looked fabulous and tasted good. We waited very long for the food for which the staff apologized and got us a complimentary starter. Was quite happy with their service. I wouldn't say the food is the best I have had but it's definitely a good place for a special occasion ( it is quite pricey

Dear Yantra, My family and I had dined on 27th of January. First thing first, I would like to say the food quality was at par with the high rating of the restaurant. Secondly, my whole family and I were very disappointed with our experience with the establishment. As an employee and a student of the hospitality industry, I understand that communication can make or break an experience for a guest. The communication, was very much lacking throughout the dining experience.I had made my reservation on 26th of January and stated that it would be my Mother‚Äôs birthday on 27th, and I would like something small to be arranged, if possible. The staff understood quickly and told me that a dessert such as a cake would be arranged. When we came to the restaurant, we were warmly greeted by the staff and sat down within a few minutes. When it came to ordering our starters, a fellow staff took our order and then another staff asked if we were ready to order, and we stated to him that the order had already been taken. A similar incident, like this also took place during the billing time. As we enjoyed the food and ambiance, we gradually reached the time to order desserts. I had expected a staff, to ask when would be the appropriate time to bring out the dessert meant for my Mother‚Äôs birthday, but nothing like that took place. They just took our order for desserts and continued with their work.Throughout our experience, I had realized many of the staff members, don‚Äôt make much eye contact with their guests, and this made me personally feel disappointed. I also felt that the communication between them is very much weak. There was no communication regarding the starter, billing and mainly the dessert meant for the birthday. As a respectable establishment, I had expected something simple as a service recovery. I had spoken to the head waitress on the phone after we left. She stated, that the cake was ready, but she didn‚Äôt know we had already left. Also, she stated that there might have been a discrepancy when it came to this matter. I expected her to say something like we could pack it and maybe you could come collect it if you haven't gone too far. But once again nothing like that happened. We all know that communication is the crux of a great experience, if there is no communication, matters like this tend to take place quite often. Overall I was quite disappointed, as I expected a lot more from a ‚ÄúChic Fine Dining Restaurant

We went today for the lunch buffet - SGD 49 ++ for basic and SGD 79++ for for food plus free flow beer and/or winethe service was amazingthe food was too... starting with pani puris and pav bhajithe wife and i are primarily veggie - the pulau left nothing to desire, the daal ( always a bellwether for us) was truly amazing - way better than the now over rated Bukhara stuffthe chicken tikka masala was toothsome as was the fishon the desserts, the ice cream and kulfi and Tras malai were great... the jalebi tasted a bit olda bit pricey but in my view easily the best indian food you are going to get in singapor
5
If you like good Indian food, this place is great. Slightly pricey but definitely worth it. Great service and fabulous food, not your usual Indian fare.
5
This is Indian style fine dining at its best the ambiance of the restaurant makes you feel special as soon as you enter, Service is slick and understated and the food is superb. Nice place for a special occasion.
5
A nice place to take office colleagues and family especially during weekdays .. they have good promotions.. food is great and innovatively presented.. a value for money.. from a very passionate person!!

I had heard so much about the buffet lunch at this restaurant, but sadly I was disappointed. The meats were so spicy that you could hardly taste anything. The spread did not have enough choices, dessert options were limited and very ordinary, nans took forever to come etc. Frankly if the food was tasty I could have overlooked all these, but sadly it was not. Drinks were ok. I spent about 400 dollars for 4 people with drinks, and frankly there are much better Indian options in Singapore which are way cheaper
4
In the buffet lunch, there are so many starters which are very tasty. I thought I would finish off my lunch with starters alone. In the main course there weren't many vegetarian dishes. It was just OK from Veg perspective. The ambience is very good and is in a great location
4
Having heard rave reviews about the place, I had always wanted to visit Yantra for their buffet offering. The Diwali special lunch buffet was an ideal opportunity to take my family and friends. Plus: Live Chaat corner serving authentic Pav BhajiGood spread of Indian vegetarian and non-vegetarian food along with free flow of Lassi (yogurt based drink)Excellent Jellibis to go along with Ras MalaiMinus: Most of the other chaats were a bit dry including the kebabsA bit highly priced for the offeringThe main course offering was averag
5
Business dinner with teammates and absolutely stellar food and service in a beautiful restaurant the dal soup and the tandoori chicken are to die for. Recommend you go here anytime you are in Singapor

had dinner last week with a group. Heard it had been revamped and that a new and famous consultant chef was heading up the revamp, culinarily speaking. Expected great things of course, silly me.the appetizers were forced and uneasy, felt like an attempt to wrest extra income from diners or maybe to emulate fine dining western restaurants where appetizers are de-rigeur. The lamb chop was deep fried with flour and served dry with no spices penetrating the meat. The crab was atrocious, a mash of spices which of course had thoroughly killed the crab, literally. Topped by a prawn which had probably been fried, refried, then left to dry for a week before gracing our plates. North Indian restaurants are generally not known for good seafood probably because the sea is so far away and the concept of fresh seafood is alien. In India, fresh usually means that it was delivered by bullock cart on large ice cubes with a sawdust topping. The paneer carpacio was laughable- small slices of cucumber (not telegraph, just cheapo) and local tomato (remember the off-orange ones) with ultra thin slices of paneer with a dusting of chaat masala over everything. Creativity thou art fled to brutish beasts... The main course did much better, the lamb dishes were tasty and well prepared, probably a bit overcooked (every chef assumes they are feeding the toothless) to be over-limp but with a nice adrak-tamater gravy. Nothing earth shattering, just good. The okra was served with onions and cut into small pcs., in a fine dining restaurant it is a no-no to cut them straight and not on a bias. Or do something to make them memorable, this preparation we can make at home in ten minutes. Naans were good but the tandoori roti was the star of the evening., Very good. Naans at 9dollars a pop (add gst and svc charge to it later) seems over the top. Overall, needs more work and more fine tuning. This is a restaurant which will appeal to the well heeled indian community in Singapore but has not make a mark as a fine dining restaurant in an international sense
5
My business partner and I visited the Yantra for dinner and were served some really great Indian tucker. This rstaurant is all class. We had a chicken dish and a lamb dish and assorted bread. It was not a complex meal but what was served was tasty and pretty. I would gladly take all our business colleagues to this restaurant. I also noted that the restaurant had a number of families eating there. Truly very pleasant experience
5
We booked a table for five of us for lunch.Its present in Tangeline Mall, Singapore. We got appreciation about its buffet lunch. Here lunchtime is upto 3.00pm so after 2.45pm no entry is permitted. Every item from soup, starter, main course and desserts were quite tasty. Every item was mild spicy. I having sweet tooth liked rasmalai and moong dal halwa. Its week day buffet lunch costs $ 30 per had exclusive of taxes. Its an Indian food restaurant
5
This place is awesome. I've eaten at other places the same chef created like Masala Art. This tops it by a long way.
The food is flawless, rich, and cooked perfectly. I love this place.
Must go!
5
A plate of appetizers that was to die for.Spicy, a bit hot but with flavors that were amazing.Main dish, different stews, lamb, fish, chicken, fish, tofu (or maybe Indian cheese).Three different deserts. Deep fried things with saffron sauce. Mmmmm. Two different sort of Tiramisu like creations. Also yummy.The whole problem is that I have no real clue what I had.We let the waiter decide what we should eat.Well.... when thinking about it, in a place like Yantra, that is the way to do it.No regrets!
3
Went for a lunch buffet. Priced at $35 nett. Nothing that fantastic. You will find what you normally find in any other north indian restaurant for lunch buffet. Some of the started and desserts were snapped up and there was no fast refill. Probably a normal person can go 2 or 3 rounds. Quite normal and average.
4
Comfortable and elegant ambience with excellent service and food but very pricey! The chicken tandoori, ganderi and galouti kebabs, chicken tikka with naan and kulcha were delectable. I would give the Bryiani and the dal a miss. Servings are quite generous so be judicious with the amount you order. It's all very expensive.
5
We went for dinner on Wednesday night at about 8.50 pm and even at that time on a weekday , the restaurant was full. I wondered how a restaurant situated in a mall can be so full. I got my answers within minutes.Impeccable service and awesome food . Most authentic Indian food I had here in my month long holiday .we Indians are little fussy about our food and must say that we were very well looked after .the menu is very innovative. Chef Hemant Oberoi who is a badshah of Indian food has put in great menu.A must visit for Indian food lovers
5
After hearing from a lot of people we finally planned to visit the place and made reservation for sunday lunch.we booked the table but after reaching there seems nobody was there ask if have booked or not..bad impression sets in my mind.ok we sat..went to see the buffet spread which was huge..specially for veggies..impression changed to hmm good.finally started with chats which included gol gappa "the water was super tasty".then had samosa chat and papdi chaat following with pav bhaji aloo chaat lentil salad fruit chat ,not go forget the capsicum shorba was outstanding and first time for me to taste.Each dish was tasty and commendable.the main course2 included achaari kadhi ,panchmel daal,matar mushroom,mix veg and,tatak aloo*finger licking*rice options were steam rice veg pulao and finally the dessert section..ice cream with gulab jamun*which was hard and not that great*kulfi stick,rice phirni and barley(jowar)kheer..After tasting or literally stuffing myself I was unable to get up2 from my seat.Wil definitely visit the place again on any special occasion.Sunday buffet lunch was $57 per pax with gst
2
I went here for dinner with my husband after hearing good things about the food. The service was ok but nothing special and the prices were very high. My main course was the prawn curry and while I asked for it to be less spicy I was still hoping for some yummy Indian flavours, unfortunately what I got was a tasteless bland dish and not at all what I was hoping for from a restaurant calling themselves the best North Indian restaurant in Singapore and charging $45 for the curry. We won't be going back
3
Fantastic ambience but for a buffet, it should have more varieties especially on the dessert section. Good service with plenty of naans bread
3
Food and service are good - however, it is very over-priced. We family of 2 adults and 2 children both aged 5 years old. Only order couple vegetarian dishes and starter and 1 desert. No alcohol, the bill over SGD 230.00. I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think so I can justify a repeat visit
5
I have always felt that Singapore could do better with authentic North Indian food. The revamped Yantra thankfully does that. We had a Sunday buffet lunch and were pleasantly surprised with the variety on offer. The kebabs were delicious and I enjoyed some relatively new dishes (for a buffet) like the Yakhni pulao, Chicken Khurchan, Rara Mutton among others. The mango kulfi in the dessert was a great ending. Overall very good value for a pricey-ish ($50++) buffet.
5
If you love food, this is a must go place. Being Indian, I am quite sure when I say that this would also be the best Indian restaurant around Singapore. We keep returning here.
3
Food above average, but price way off. The tandoori avocado for $32 with four pieces and masala on top was the spoiler. On the whole good atmosphere and service, but you can get better food choices for the price.
5
Once you are dead tired after shopping at Orchard street malls, do visit this place for great indian food which will relieve all your tiredness.
Do try baked gulab jamun
4
This is an excellent Indian restaurant in Singapore. The lunch buffet on Sundays is delicious, plenty of options and dessert included.
5
Awesome Indian Food at the totally renovated Yantra restaurant under the new Chef. Great presentation, Great service and lip smacking food. If you are in Singapore and like Indian food, this is a place you must visit.

I visited Yantra few days back with 3 other colleagues for the buffet lunch. I had read and heard good things about Yantra in the past. It is rated as one of the best Indian restaurant in the fine dining category. The hype surrounding the place is true to some extent. The menu is designed by renowned chef Hemant Oberoi who also happened to be maternal uncle of one of our colleague.The place is quite spacious and has a nice decor with a warm feeling to the overall environment. At the reception / entrance you can find photos of Mr. Oberoi with world leaders including Barac Obama. The arrangement of buffet and the seating area are nicely separated. I forgot to count the number of items, but there must have been atleast 40-50 items to choose from in different categories like appetizers, soups, salads, dry veggies and curries, Indian breads, rice, daals, pickles, desserts. Each category has atleast 2-3 choices to choose from. The spread is evenly balanced between veg & non veg options.I don't know if it is normal for fine dining restaurants to serve small portions. The starters and soups for example were served in very small servings. I liked the Aaloo tikki in starters. The good part of the buffet was also that the breads were freshly prepared and served on demand on the table.The taste of curries, daal and rice items was decent. I did not find any dish which can be termed extra ordinary. The variety of items and the overall presentation of them was quite good. The staff was also polite, helpful to address all our queries and service was excellent.Based on the overall experience, I would recommend the place for special occasions which demand special celebrations with the near and dear ones
5
It's the best Indian Restaurant for extra fine dining you can find in Singapore. Though it might be quite expensive, the buffet has quality and tasty food with a wide variety of dishes starting from starters to deserts. Ambience is peaceful and not very grand which makes it a venue for all foodies. The food could have been a bit hotter. There could have been more South Indian dishes as 80% of the food was North Indian. Overall had a great brunch and memorable experience
5
The place is really nice, somewhere you would go to for a quiet dinner in candlelight. The staff is courteous, and we were seated in a quiet corner. The overall feel of this restaurant is relaxing with the reception welcoming with a Buddha. Food was authentic Indian, however spices were on a milder side. The bill was not as likable as the food, but then again, it is a super fine dinning place
5
To get haute-cuisine Indian food you have to go to India. Right? Wrong! In my business travels to India I have visited my fair share of Indian food temples. But my meal at Yantra beats the best of India hands down. Presentation, combination and distinctiveness of flavors, authenticity and cultural inheritance are all reflected and blended together perfectly. South, North, East and West are represented, there were even a couple of Parsi dishes in the lineup of the tasting menu.The quality is reflected in the prices so if you are looking for a large bowl of Biryani then better look somewhere else. Yantra is like a culinary voyage through India and it's one for all senses. Absolutely brilliant
5
The restaurant has been renovated and the setting and ambiance are spectacular. Presentation and service were impeccable. This is not your standard curry house and the food was excellent. The grilled paneer and the chicken tandoori stood out for me. The a la carte menu is quite pricey and the Entertainer app was very helpful with the one for one main course discount.
5
Best place to have indian food in singapore .Good ambience , good food and best mocktales.
They serve the best veg kababs
4
During our visit to Singapore we tried Lunch Buffet at this restaurant.
It was very good and good ambiance. There were so many people other than Indian. We went there during weakdays also there was enough crowd.
2
Went today, very bland and offered no nan or anything.. Very disappointed. Maybe came on a bad day? The only thing with any real taste was the pickle as a side dish...
4
We were regulars at the original Yantra before it was refurbished and reopened. It had always been one of our favourite Indian spots in town, so our fingers were crossed that under the new chef, the restaurant would have maintained its standards.The menu has changed somewhat, especially in the starter section. Our beloved tandoori sharing platters were missing, and the chaats offered were just too funky for us. (Please bring back the basic chaats!)The lamb and chicken dum Briyani were awesome, and had all of us reaching for seconds. The Chicken Bhartha was better than the original Yantra's, the Martaaban lamb a crowd favourite, the Goan fish curry too mild (but still very good), and the Palak Paneer was good, but not great.The dessert items are quite exorbitantly priced, and I would be happy to skip and have sweets at Brunetti next door. They need to review their pricing, for sure.Service was friendly and attentive, especially since we met a few familiar faces who were from the original staff. And yes, we'll definitely be back
2
Totally destroyed. Yantra 'used' to be our all time favourite when it came to upmarket Indian cuisine. It checked all the boxes. Was there after the remodelling and long story short - missed out on the ambience, prices hiked, quantity reduced, menu deteriorated (even the physical menu), something wrong with acoustics and service was no better than your average third tier restaurants. Well the service part could be due to the new opening and will take some time to settle. Ordered something that never came except that it reflected on the bill. Being a foodie, just grieving the loss of an excellent restaurant.........
5
You can look at it as overpriced Indian food, or forget the fact you are paying $40 for a Chicken Tika which will probably be the most overpriced Chicken Tika you have ever forked out for, but is is every bit delicious and flavorful? Absolutely. My girlfriend and I had our own mains, rice to share and a chicken starter. It set us back about $80 per head. If you forget about how expensive it is, you will really enjoy every bite. I intend on returning to try what other dishes this place has to offer. I really enjoyed myself and found the food to be particularly delicious
4
Dinner with business colleagues. This is not Little India food, it is Indian with a contemporary twist. Very well cooked. Never had an Indian spiced edamame taco before, but it works very well. The meats are wonderfully cooked the flavours great and the spice level is right. Very good breads too
2
I used to be a great fan of this upscale Indian restaurant, but my visit last week changed my mind. Since my last visit the restaurant has been remodelled. Perhaps they haven't finished (in which case they shouldn't have opened) but the hard floor, walls and decorations result in an acoustic disaster. The background noise on our table for 5 was so loud that we couldn't have a conversation. At the prices they aspire to ($32 for a Dal Makhani, $10 for a single Naan, etc) the food and service needs to be impeccable. It isn't. It took 20 minutes for drinks to arrive, more than half an hour for the first morsel of food to arrive at the table, and when the main courses finally arrived, it was another 10-15 minutes before the "accompanying" rice and breads reached us, so the main courses were cold by that time. This might just about be OK in a food court (where service is generally better) but not in a restaurant which is charging absolute top-of-the-range prices. So dinner for 5, including a total of 2 beers, 3 lassis and tap water was well over $500. I left feeling frustrated at not having been able to converse and cheated by the overly ambitious pricing. The food was actually mostly good, but couldn't compensate for the failings of this redesigned restaurant. I filled in the customer feedback form in the restaurant, but received no response, so presumably, they don't care. Try the Indian Rangmahal in Pacific Place if you want upmarket Indian, it is better all round after the Yantra make-over
5
We loved this place as the flavours are authentic Indian .. We walked in without a reservation on a Wednesday and found a place easily ..however it was quite full by the time we ended our dinner .. It might look pricey but worth the money .. The service is very slow though
5
Chef Hemant Oberoi's Magic truly knows no boundaries... Today was the 2nd day of 'Yantra by Hemant Oberoi' (erstwhile Yantra) and the place looks transformed but has retained its air of familiarity that endeared us loyal customers. The carefully created menu - comprising some old favourites, some items found only in selected places in India and some fiercely Creative items makes Yantra by Hemant Oberoi a place where one needs to come again & again just to try & sample the many potential favourites. The delicious food & the same warm service complete what is perhaps one of Singapore's best Indian dining experiences. Can't wait to see what Hemant has done to the Sunday buffet lunch!
4
Such a beautiful Restaurant. Food was good and service part is ok.
Overall good experience
Staff friendly.
5
Yantra is perhaps the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. Do check out the buffet at lunch. Service is quick and staff is very courteous. Ideal place for taking friends and family to tickle those Indian taste buds
5
Best Indian Buffet ever ! Cost $25 week and $30 weekend. Do not try to get a better place for lunch !
4
My wife travelled to Singapore and was staying at Regent Hotel.
Yantra was one of the best Indian restaurants at walking distance from her hotel. The food was excellent but a bit on the costlier side.
5
We just seem to come back to this place for their buffet lunch. Normally we steer clear from buffet food but every dish served here is like an a la carte meal. When the place is full of Indian business people eating here you know it must be good
2
We went for 25 dishes for $25 Lunch Buffet on a thursday. We are pure vegetarian so didn't expect too much variety of food for us but expected good main course. There were 3 veg salads (Greek Salad, Mixed Salad and pickled type salad) and 2 snacks options (corn kabab and gobi pakoda). The Greek salad was finshed at 1pm (lunch time 12-3pm) and was empty till 2:30pm with excuses that they are making it and it is coming. In the main course, we had pulao rice, Raita (which was empty bowl all the time even after asking for 4-5 times) Yellow dal, Baigan gravy dish, Mix veg dry and paneer makhani. The only good main course was the yellow dal. Rest of the food was not good.We asked the waiter for Bread/Naan to be extra crispy and he made a sarcastic comment and argued with us which was very unpleasant and spoilt our lunch date. He realized it later and apologized to us. With this experience at yantra, I feel I should not give more than 2 or 2.5 rating for such a high class restaurant and it is not at all worth the $58 for 2 for vegetarians. The highlights were salads which were very good and Breads/Naans which were very crispy to our taste
3
Probably the best palak paneer in Singapore --- you can tell from the color and the texture that it is so fresh -- bright green and light texture and not at all oily... but the other dishes are so-so.Low lights were the garfa tikki which are patties of garbanzos (chick peas) and fava beans -- it was dry and was bordering flavorless. Also avoid the vegetable samosas --- which is surprising for an Indian restaurant to miss. The pastry of the samosas was too thick and dry so the ratio between the filling and pastry was off... too little filling. Then the filling also lacked flavor so it was like cardboard. The butter chicken was delicious but then so many other Indian restaurants can do butter chicken very well at half the price. The same goes with the mango kulfi -- it was good but I have had better.The prawns cooked in a tandoor was tender and cooked well but lacked the garlic and anise flavor as described in the menu. So if your guests are more on presentation and does not have such a discriminating palate, you can take them here since they make an effort on presentation. The prawns are flambeed table side, then the kulfi is served on dry ice. So some folks are easily impressed with those..
5
While there are far too many Indian restaurants in Singapore, there are very few which serve GOOD North Indian food. In fact, we couldn't shortlist even 1 which really stood out until we visited Yantra last Friday (thanks to our Friends!)Exceptionally delicious food with a lot of variety. Service is a bit on the slow side (possibly given its full at most times) but servers are professional - best that i have experienced in an Indian restaurant in Singapore. Prices are rather steep although definitely feels worth.We tried their non-veg Chef's Platter (awesome!), Broccoli Cheese Tikki and of course, daal makhani. Enjoyed every bit!Don't miss their phenomenal cocktails with a 'desi' twist.Try them if you haven't and i assure you will keep coming back! We are definitely going back to try their Raan
1
We had lunch in their buffet and reached with a good 45 mins until buffer close. Most counters were empty and the waitress promised us that they are being refilled and we can take our seats. After about 30 mins barely half the dishes were available with the rest still empty. Even after repeated inquiries most serving staff did not bother to even pacify the customers who were clearly frustrated. A pricy lunch which was not even remotely satisfying. It was supposed to be a fine dining restaurant but we couldn't taste most of their dishes so couldn't comment if the food was really fine..Definitely never going back to this place.
3
We just tried having the buffet lunch at Yantra on Friday and it was ok- for vegetarians, two main course items and dal and biryani, and 3 starters, out of which brocolli was really good. Paneer didn't have much of taste, and in the main course the korma looked like it was made out of previous day's leftovers. Rest of the food was ok. Nothing exceptional. At 30 plus plus it's just about ok
5
As a Service it's best place to go and Injoy.
Food was excellent not to very Havy. very light food good presentation
Atmosphere and ambiance was great.
On my last visit I was Disapointed.But this time management cover everything.
it was a great experienced.
5
Great restaurant for Indian food in Singapore. Good service and good presentation. The sunday buffet is good value with fares like chole bhature, chaat and jalebis. Highly recommended...

We were at the restaurant on 18 Jan. 2016, to celebrate the b'day of one of the members of our Indian-French family. A waiter took the orders for drinks/appetiser. After a few minutes, another waiter noted down the orders for the main course. Drinks were served. We were waiting for the appetisers. After 30 mts, one the waiters arrived to serve the main course. We were surprised. Then we came to know that our appetiser orders were messed up. After 45 minutes, the appetisers started arriving. We were already very upset. At this time, one of our guests found a fly in her wine glass. She could not control her laughter. She could never imagine such a thing happening in S'pore and that too in a restaurant like Yantra. Immediately, the glass was replaced. Wine was served again. Because of long waiting and the fly, we had pay for the second bottle of wine. Of course, we finished our dinner. I am not sure whether this is a lone incident or it happens often at this restaurant. But, I should admit that I have the greatest admiration for the the lady waiter who handled the whole situation with such grace and calmness. Moral of the story, let your all orders be handled by only one waiter. The restaurant offered us a 15% discount on the whole bill just to make us happy. As far as food is concerned, the Lamb, Paneer stuff were all sweet, Lady's finger was raw. May be Gujjus would have liked them.The location of the restaurant is good and so also the ambience. I am in two minds whether I should visit this restaurant agai
4
Very good interior . menu card is impressive and give clear idea about item , Starters were great .main course was also tasty . we tried Chhole , Dal Tadka , Palak Paneer , Bhindi etc . every thing was good . Rates are on higher side. Service is slow . Overall good experienc
5
Always liked Yantra's for the food, decor and service. Went with family recently and had the Tandoori Mushroom and Non-Veg Kabab platter, for the main course had the Rogan Gosht, Dal and Sabzi along with Nan and steamed rice. The food is exquisite but expensive. Be prepared to spend atleast $50 for dinner per paxReally enjoyed the food and this place is becoming better with time
4
Went for new year's buffer lunch. They had a good spread of starters, main course and dessert. Had mango lassi and shikanjivi as part of buffet too. The chaat counters, punjabhi chole-bhature and jalebi were great! Both the veg and non-veg options were plenty and delicious. We will visit again in the future
2
What makes Indian food so delicious ? Intoxicating spices, variety of dishes, and a cook that knows how to bring these wonderful ingredients together. Grant it, Indian cuisine is complicated joining spices to shape flavor, each dish offering a unique flavor. Sadly something went wrong in the shaping of spice combinations each dish remained at war with one another, over-spiced and over-priced. Yantra overshot good and went straight to bad. Been there many times before, highly doubtful we will return
3
Food and service are good and the decor is quite special - however, it is very over-priced for what it is (to the point where we probably wouldn't go again). I have no issue paying for top restaurants but when you charge exorbitant prices (and we only ordered vegetarian dishes) which are good but not spectacular or unique, I don't feel I can justify a repeat visit
5
I've only had dinner once at the Yantra. The food portions aren't overwhelming but the taste of each and every single dish is epic. I've been to hundreds of Indian restaurants worldwide but this one blew me away (taste-wise). Their Papdi chaat is really nice. Murgh Zafrani Tikka....outstanding...Murgh Makhni....very delicious....Saag Paneer...never had a better one before....I even enjoyed their lamb dishes although I usually don't like lamb that much. They know how to properly spice a dish. If I could afford it I would go there every other day...it's really good food
3
We went to the buffet Diwali lunch which was advertised as a special event but we were a litle bit disappointed with the whole experience.The street food chaat appetizers were different but too hot in taste to enjoy.There were only 5/6 dishes for starters and main courses for vegetarians considering that it wasexpensive.Again everything was smothered with chilli.I must have drunk at least 3 litres of water.There were no pappadoms to munch on and no salads either.  There was nothing that made it special for Diwali, it was just a buffet. Where were all the special dishes which are cooked for Diwali? A fruit salad for a dessert dish is not that special.The service was hit and miss.Our gin and tonics were served with a lot of going back and forth.First no ice then no lemon and so on.It is a popular place but I have eaten better food in Little India area of Singapore. It could be a good restaurant but in my view everything needs twicking a little.Lots of Chillies do not make good indian food
4
Very good value spread for lunch and with chicken, fish and prawns. They even had tiramisu cake and fresh fruits available for dessert. Come hungry, the food is heavy and very tasty
5
Authentic Indian food. The jalebis were really good and altogether, it was a satiating meal. I recommend the Sunday brunch.
4
5* prices match 5* food quality. Like many people we have been to hundreds of "Indian" restaurants the world over. This is like none of them. The food is entirely different in concept, taste and presentation. For example, more than half of the menu had no name match with other restaurants so the accurate descriptions were essential. The Peshwari naan came drizzled with honey. Food portions were very generous.The wine list was fabulous.If there were negatives they would be that:- the bread and rice was served (after we asked twice) about 30 minutes after the first dishes appeared.- Food was served onto our plates from the dishes in which they came rather than allowing us to serve as and when we were ready (to keep the food warm whilst the bread and rice arrived.
1
When I went to Yantra 5 years back, I could've sworn that they served the best Indian food in Singapore.All of that changed on a fateful Saturday afternoon. Leave alone the price which is a total scam (A jaw dropping 60$ for a buffet spread of less than 15 dishes!)The starters were semi decent and the waiters were well trained; the biryani though was the crown jewel. It seemed to have been doused in an unbelievable amount of spices. So much so, that you could hardly breathe. Needless to say, my date was completely ruined. -_-I am giving this place 1/5, because I can't give 0. Lackadaisical
3
Having decided on a last minute trip to visit some old friends in Singapore, Mr. Cousin insisted that a curry takeaway was a necessary part of the holiday. However staying in a part of Singapore we are not familiar with meant we had to take directions to the nearest Indian eatery in order to satisfy Mr. Cousin's cravings for spice. Yantra was the place and upon arriving I should have realised it was a place for a dining experience and not for a plastic bag and a few free poppadoms. Knowing what I wanted, I did not look at the menu and hence the prices. Luckily when the bill came I had dulled my senses with a couple of cheeky tiger beers at the overly plush bar. Yantra is hugely over priced for example a paneer masala was SGD34 (equivalent of 17 pounds) for a bit of cheese in a curry sauce. The food is fine, perhaps a bit sweet but the value is not there and there is much better Indian food at more affordable prices in Singapore.The manager is a really friendly guy and we had a good chat while I was awaiting food, however sorry mate Yantra gets a reverse terminator.

I'm not one to write restaurant reviews but today's meal seriously deserved the one coming!Date night with hubby at one of the finest Indian restaurants in Singapore (as we were told) cost us over 250 dollars.What we got in return were kababs that tasted just wrong. I'm sorry those were nothing like galauti kebabs - bright red mince with no flavor of any sort.The butter chicken came in a bowl of gravy that tasted like over sweetened ketchup. The naan was sweet and dripping in oil.The rest of the dishes were quite meh and I would not be recommending them either.Waste of money. I'm sure there's much better food to be had!

We arrived at the restaurant and the staff was so nice in recommending plates... I love butter chicken and the Tika Massala, ordered it and was fabulous!Don't forget to ask for nan with something like honey and pistachio it mingles great with the curry... Everything was perfect... Congrat

I was told that this is one of the finest Indian restaurant in Singapore. My business clients had organized a dinner there. The place is behind Regent Hotel and centrally located. We reached there early at around 7 PM. The place started filling up and was full in another hour or so. It was crowded and noisy like a north Indian eatery. There were both business and family eaters, which included Indians, Europeans and Singaporeans. The place was very friendly with pleasant staff. The food was excellent. I opted for a very standard veg fare like Dal -fry, Bhindi fry and palak ka sag (spinach). the vegetables were fresh and yummy which was surprising. there were indian dessert on offer, which I declined. Over all I rate it 5/5.I recommend everyone visiting Singapore, must go to this place once. It is costly than little India but worth every penny

As a tourist in Singapore, I have visited several Indian restaurants in Singapore. Yantra is without comparison the best. The setting was perfect - we could chose between a private room or a table where we could see the chefs preparing the food. For a starter we had a several dishes. The were all very good especially the lambchops and the Koliwada shrips was excellent. For mains we had different types chicken and lamb, Naan bread, rice etc. For a European this was quite spicy, but in a delicate way, which is rarely seen. The service was perfect and very attentive.The price level is higher than other Indian restaurants in Singapore, but not higher than in Europe and compared to the quality - it was good value for money
5
We had a lunch buffet here during the week and the food was absolutely superb. There were about 25 dishes or so to chose from and each dish had the quality of an a la carte meal. We have never tasted so good Indian food, since Dawat in NYC. There is a large array of vegetarian options also. There is more vegetarian dishes than meat dishes actually. And also the price was incredibly reasonable. We will definitely be back here next time.
5
I love going back again and again for the lunch buffets here. It is always a different menu and many times with experimental dessert dishes which I haven't eaten before like beetroot halwa, aam rasmalai.
4
Authentic North Indian food with a great wine rack. The tandoori and awadhi kebabs like the Gilauti kebab were very good considering we were in Singapore and not Lucknow. A good experince for non indians wanting to try good authentic North West Indian fare
5
Very nice place to eat food every thing very nice specialy staff very frenkly my favourite staff there his name john i treat us very well
5
I have chance to dine here twice. I was invited by an australian friend. The place is great for fine dining. You are treated as Maharaja. Their Gobi and Paneer are still engraved in my taste buds
5
Yantra has maintained its standard over the years and offers an excellent small buffet for weekday lunch. The location at Tanglin Mall is convenient, the ambience & decor are really relaxing yet with a hint of fine dining. It's value for money.
4
With 5 persons having dinner here. Food was really good. Chef was attentive to diet wishes. Nice looking restaurant with good distance between tables to great privacy.
5
If you're looking for North Indian food, Yantra is the place. A fantastic weekend lunch buffet (booking is advisable) where one is spoilt for choice or ordering a-la-carte during dinner.. every visit is great. Service is good too as the staff anticipate what you really want & oblige..

I went to Yantra for their weekday (Mon-Thurs) 12 noon to 3pm lunch buffet. Price was at $25++ per pax for 25 dishes. I found the spread to be adequate and there was always something for everyone. Prawns, chicken, fish, Mushrooms, Dhaal, vegetables etc.There was only the usual lunch crowd which was a handful so we enjoyed the peaceful ambience. A basket of naan was served at my table. Table next to me had to request for a basket so do take note if they don't serve you the naan.I liked the panner butter masala which was rich & creamy. I would have to say the food was tasty & ingredients were just the right amount.Desserts were Gulab jamun, mango rasmalai & carrot halwa. Ice cream were melting & were unslightly to look at so I didn't try them.Food was not piping hot but luke warm which I didn't really prefer. Waiters were attentive. Drinks are expensive. A sweet laasi cost us $10 each which is rather rather expensive. So you are better off with plain water if you are on a budget.Overall, an affordable hearty lunch buffet
3
Staff were friendly and the place looks great, but i didn't really enjoy this as much as i thought, i didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t think there was enough choice on the starters or the mains, the only bread that was available - plain Nan - just seemed to turn up at the table when we were off getting our food, it arrived all at once and was not refreshed. I am from the UK so apologise if this is the norm or considered good in Singapore, but from this experience if you want a good curry come to the UK. Maybe their normal menu would have been a better choice
5
We decided to celebrate our annual bash here, together with my colleagues we really like the food here. As for myself i really enjoyed the fine dinning experience. Prior to this i am not really into indian dishes but tasting the food served to us that time , i began my appreciation to indian cuisin
4
The food is really different to a lot of Indian cuisine. Creative combinations produce a delightful meal.
This is my 4th visit to Yantra and it continues to impress.
3
The food was okay , good dessert options , had a fair number of choices for both vegetarian and non-vegetarians. The setting was good , tables apart such that they are not crowded , good ambience. Appreciate their hygiene sense , great to have disposable good quality table napkins and high standard of cleanliness. Waiters and waitresses were very polite and efficient in attending to guests
1
took my friend who came from korea .. one of the worst Indian food I ever .. the expensive lamb chops were burn and meat was so hard we could not eat it.then came in the butter chicken .. the sause was ok ( sweet ) but the mean again was stale.icing on the cake the - toilets were overflowing and the waiter just didnt want to hear my complain just showed his back and walked away arrogantly. Sheer waste of time and money ...

This restaurant in Tanglin Mall, just at the tip of Orchard road, offers all your food needs like Appetizers, Kebabs, Main Course etc. Vegetarian, Jain, and Non-veg food is prepared with authentic flavors and taste. The atmosphere and ambiance is very good. Service is polite and quick.They have a nice bar offering hundreds of varieties. They can arrange parties, functions, receptions and corporate events for you. More than 100 guests can be accommodated. They even have private dining room with exclusive crockery, cutlery and glassware.A must try once
5
Brilliant overall dining experience..we went there as 2 familes (4 adults and 2 children) for their popular Sunday Brunch, and were wowed with the overall variety the Buffet offers;ChaatLive Dosa CounterKababsVeg & Non veg startersSaladsButter Milk, Jal Jeera, Lassi and much moreBiryaniA fantastic variety of Indian breadsMouth Watering dessertsFantastic ambience, great food...costs SGD 48++ per person for the Sunday Bruch, which translates into ~SGD 56 including a 10% service charge and 7% GST..An absolute must try for a great Indian Fine Dining Experience in Singapore. Would rate this right up there in terms of quality of food..probably one of the 2 best restaurants in Singapore for Indian dining experience
4
I had dinner at Yantra on Wednesday 22 April. I didn't know what to expect and was highly impressed by the decor. This set the standard for the rest of the meal.The food has a fusion twist, but isn't as spicy as I like. We had the Vindaloo,which was a little to tomato for me. The Rogan Josh on the other hand was to die for! I would place this restaurant in the same class as Song of India, but a step lower. This restaurant is well worth a visit
3
we felt service was way too slow, even though restaurant was not full. Food portion are relatively big as compare to Singapore standard. We found food is priced on higher side.We liked starters and Jalebi as desert. Overall value for money is really poor.There are other indian fine dinning options nearby which offer overall better experience than this
4
Yantra is my favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore - delicate North Indian flavours, especially love the Dhaal and Cottage cheese in spinach.lunch buffet - best value for money,around 30 SGD for a wide selection of dishes,comes with Naan bread. On weekends buffet slightly more expensive but less dishes. good for business lunches as well.- Dinner .as a few other reviewers mentioned on the expensive side. I stopped going in the evenings as I feel being ripped off.NOTE - aircondition quite strong, ladies : take a shawl or jacke
4
The food is nice and did not give a very heavy feeling.I asked for the Indian gravy to be made extra extra spicy and yes they delivered.The food was always served piping hot and flavors created unique and had style.The people serving always smiling and dinner place was quiet
4
A really great place for all Indians and others as well . The kabab platter (non veg) was awesome and was very filling The platter comes with a kabob, sea food , chicken and a mince per platter . We ordered 4 platters for 4 adults and were we stuffed !!!!!The biryani rice was very good and portions large .The mutton dian gosht was heavenly and the garlic naan good too .However stuffed you are don't miss the dessert . The mango kulfi and the brownie are really out of this world  Reservation is a must . Excellent if you want the classic rich north Indian fare !!
5
All I can say is that this is the best restaurant in the world! The food is completely astonishing............I love it!!!
5
My friend and I returned to this restaurant after eating there once before. It is a beautiful, upscale restaurant, and our experience with the waitstaff was very positive. It is quite expensive, particularly when compared to other Indian restaurants. We knew that going in, so we didn't suffer sticker shock. The food was delicious, and the servings are quite large. I wouldn't suggest an appetizer and an entree if you have a modest appetite. We shared Tandoori Aloo, Chicken Bharta, and Jhinga Goa curry. All were delicious
1
Where do I begin about how bad the food was?Every dish lacked flavour.There werent many dishes to begin with and for a vegetarian the options were even lesser. The Kurma was bad,all I could taste was sugar .The rice was cold and dry...There was no one to refill the rice when it was over. The starters which were very few was disappointing. the vegetables were burnt. The kheer was tooo sweet for my liking. The Naan was very average and you charge $30 per person.....
4
Dinner with friends on a Saturday night. Nice and cosy atmosphere, decent service (nothing outstanding).Food was indeed good, quite rich and heavy to my taste and very salty and very large portions. But the price ruins the whole experience, mains are 50SGD average and the concept of Indian cuisine is to share dishes, so we ended up spending in one night our monthly average...Will NOT go back. The good quality is clearly overpriced there
1
This restaurant is beyond ridiculous and is overcharging, especially for vegetables, for 6 small pieces of broccoli they charge 30 sgd which is about 15 GBP, the most expensive restaurants in London would only charge maximum 11 sgd for the same so Yantra is charging almost 300 % more than London 5 star restaurants side order of vegetables. A complete joke.For the main course which consisted of 2 small pieces of chicken breast they charge 37 sgd still ridiculous but compared to the broccoli it comes out as better value , the 42 sgd for a potion of biriany rice another joke.The place is not recommended service is also very poor
1
They charged 30 SGD for a side of broccoli. Which was served lukewarm.The wine was charged as 100 SGD on the bill, but the menu had it as 95 sgd.When we complained they said that the menu had not been updated. No discount was given on the bill in spite of our complaints. I would give zero for value if possible. It felt like a rip off
3
The prices of the food is mad. A mutton briyani is priced $40! All dishes cost between the range of $30 to $60. I had a voucher that allowed me to purchase 1 for 1 main course and yet I ended up paying $240. Food is good but nothing fantabulous or out of this world. If u wanna try this restaurant, rather go for their weekday lunch buffet priced at $25
3
Upper end Indian restaurant, next to Jen Hotel which is just off Orchard Road. You would not normally walk past so must get by on reputation.Food was very good, but menu appeared a bit limited. Staff slightly pretentious.Main downside was cost. Strange thing is that with tip i would have paid the $100 it eventually cost me, but the price without service just seemed too high, and set higher expectations than was delivere
2
Trying yantra after a year as our previous experience was disappointing. We went for their Christmas /NY buffet. The service was non existent and it was difficult to get any ones attention. The food quality was very poor given the price. The saag in the saag makai seemed to be off. The pani puri shell was soggy. One had to make multiple requests for the buffet to be replenished. The positives were the chicken bharta and the rabri (although that also finished and was not replenished) Unlikely to visit again.
4
We went on a Saturday noon ! Limited crowd . Highly recommended for small group of family/friends. Not too crowded like the other indian restaurants. Food was amazing , 5-6 starters . Prawns, chicken cooked to perfection . The chicken curry was delicious! I did not like the veg curry too much . Desserts we had jelebi and mango rasmalai . One suggestion would be to increase the items in deserts menu, maybe add few extra flavours of ice cream/cake
5
We were recommended to this restaurant and we not sorry. The food is divine. The curries and the biryani were delicious. Lots of different Indian food made differently but exceptional. We received great service even though it was Christmas Eve.
4
I only got take away and didn't dine at the restaurant. The lady taking my order was very good but I saw how the another waiter was dealing with other customers and it was off-putting. I ordered one Daal, one chick-pea curry, one saffron chicken, four naan and one peshwari naan and the bill was a whopping SG $150!!! Definitely the most expensive meal I've ever had. I've given a lower mark because the naan didn't warrant a $9 price tag. It wasn't really that good. The daal was average but the rest of the food was splendid. .
4
We had a farewell buffet lunch at Yantra restaurant located in the Tanglin Mall, Orchard. Since we went on Thursday, it cost 25++ SGD per person. On weekends, it cost 49++ SGD. The food was tasty, lots of choices, enjoyed the mutter methi curry with jeera rice. Good choice of non-veg too. The Goan curry was great
1
Good Food but really bad service and stupidly expensive for what you get.Changed my original dish at time of ordering which then turned with the new dish, was then made to feel like a criminal by 3 staff members for not wanting it!!Also a smile from anyone of the staff wouldn't go a miss.Give this place a wide berth if you have any sense.
4
Went there this evening with a couple of work colleagues. The d√É¬©cor is upmarket and modern. The restaurant was empty when we arrived but soon filled as many tables were reserved. The menu was extensive and well illustrated leaving a dilemma as to what to order as so many dishes looked good. We all ordered separate dishes but when they arrived, the waiter carefully served us all a little of each of the dishes. This wasn't our original intention but on reflection was a great idea as all three were amazing. Rich sauces, tender - melt in your mouth - meat and delicate spiced flavours. Not your everyday Indian, but fine dining. Food prices were a little more than expected but given the quality of the food it was still good value
4
A friend suggested going out on Saturday night for a curry after 2 weeks straight at work without a day off. I had in my mind a Chicken Jalfrezi, a Garlic Naan the size of an ironing board and about 6 pints of Kingfisher to wash it down. Well, what a turn up for the books. The food is truly excellent, fine dining with an delicate and complex Indian flavour, and not a rugby player in sight. We made our choices and then as the food arrived it was all shared out so we all got to try everything. As said in other reviews, the service was a bit lacklustre and they seemed to be ushering us out of the door (until we tried to pay, then we had to go and do the pestering). Maybe the trick is to go earlier, would definitely try it again as an early evening option. But then the only option is to go to bed after because the food is so good, you eat so much of it! Worth a visit
4
Yantra is upscale Indian food - elegant dining room with pricey food to match. However, the food was delicious, even though it took forever to come out (at 9pm and restaurant maybe 1/2 full). Service was otherwise typical Singaporean, had to flag someone down for more water. We had two veg dishes - black lentils and vegetable korma - and a couple different breads. It was very tasty and more than enough for two, enough perhaps even for 4 if you get rice, too
5
My Indian friend bring me to the restaurant. It's not only normal one as usual but serves delicate food. We order two sets of kebabs and dessert " Jalebi ". Even through the price is higher than normal restaurant, I still recommend to visit this restaurant in some important date. :
4
We have been to Yantra a number of times with friends and always loved the food. We tried both buffet as well as the al a carte and can tell you there is a vast difference. While buffet is good with a good spread etc it isn't great in terms of taste. Al a carte on the other hand is wonderful. We ordered al a carte a number of times and were never once disappointed.. Staff on the other hand are mostly disappointing. The al a carte prices are quite high but the food is worth the money

I had to think long and hard before writing this review and Dharmendra, the General Manager deserves credit for making me thinking again and not writing this establishment off.My wife and I had a simply appalling dining experience yet still came away with hope.The bad, we walked in, no one to greet us. Once they did, half way through walking us to our table we were left to mind our own business as the member of staff attended to something else. Zero apology made.On being seated we were offered nothing. We scrambled and were given one drinks list, we got a second later after prompting. You can spot the pattern.We then ordered a 400 dollar bottle of champagne (we should hopefully have their attention now) but no, it turned up warm and we were forced to continually pour top ups for ourselves.There were any number of things that went wrong afterwards leading to several chats with the manager. It would be boring to repeat them all.Things got slightly better and we have to say the food was very good, we calmed down and resolved to give Yantra at least one more try.Then at 10pm we started feeling hot (Singapore is 200kms from the equator) and were told that the building aircon turns off at 10pm - this in a restaurant where our total bill was over 800 dollars.We again spoke with the manager who is a wonderful and humble human being and we want to give this place another try but the owners simply need to change their attitude and staffing.I'm still a little muddled as to what to write but the food and genuine apologies make us want to persevere. It is however very expensive given the quality of service and the ludicrous aircon situation. We honestly can't recommend Yantra but we urge the owners to listen and improve a restaurant with wonderful potential
5
I visited first time today Yantra for dinner and I am fully satisfied with the food. Ambiance is excellent and the food is brilliant. I must say this is one of the best Indian food restaurant in Singapore. Highly recommended. Good value for money.
4
Family weekend outing for Indian Food in Sigapore was indeed good experience to have Indian Tandoori dishes.Food was tasty but on heavier side.Service was good.Looking for Indian food, must visit to enjoy.
2
Every dish was far too heavy and over sauced.The service was very nearly downright rude.It was a poor menu and a terrible ambience.They need a serious rethink here
2
Went to Yantra at the recommendation of the St. Regis Hotel nearby. The initial part of the service was ok, but when we took some time to decide on what to order, partly because we got into a conversation with other diners sitting near us about our hometowns, a waitress came over to sort of press us to decide. The food arrived with reasonable dispatch and was served for us by the waitress without her asking or saying a word. The food was good, but subsequent visits by the waitress revealed a diminished interest, and at times, what appeared to be unfriendliness toward us and borderline hostility, especially at one point where the waitress cleared the table (she seemed to be in a hurry to end our service)... The waitress took a display placard and moved it from the side of the table and set it directly between us in the middle of the table, as if to end our conversation and entice immediate payment and departure. I watched her with amusement, glaring back at her the way she'd been glaring at me, and without words it seemed obvious that some battle was ensuing, the reason for which was simply bewildering to us. We were not offered any dessert or coffee. Reading some of the previous reviews, I think it's clear there is some issue in the restaurant. The food was very good, but a curry and a vegetable dish plus rice for 109SD seems outrageous. I would normally pay about one third of that at MOST for such a meal, probably a lot less. I wouldn't go back nor could I recommend this place to others
4
One of the finest and affordable place to cherish Indian Buffet with amazing ambience. Even as a vegetarian i would highly recommend this place. Right from Starters to Deserts it was amazing. Just a couple of suggestions: Pls Provide soup in the buffet to make it a wholistic experience. The staff could be more friendly and energetic, they are good but could be better to invite people again

Yantra definitely has to be one of the finest restaurants in Singapore serving authentic north Indian food. The unique feature about their dishes is that they try to play around with different ingredients and flavours. Most of the times you would not expect to see such a combination but they manage to full through with such mouth watering taste.My first visit to Yantra was about 6 years ago when it was still new at that point of time. Today I would have probably been there more than thrice because of their ambience, food and service but as the saying goes the first impression is always the best impression. I can still vividly remember my first visit to the restaurant that is located at the peaceful corner of Tanglin Mall.I am not particularly fan of Indian food but I like to try different cuisines so when I heard of Yantra‚Äôs opening I wanted to give it a try so went to Yantra with few friends of mine, the exterior of the restaurant is really beautiful specially their Bar, it is actually very simple set-up just other side of restaurant but it gives you resort like feel because of the seats and their arrangements.When you walk into the restaurant, it might seem pretty dim but it adds on to the coziness of the place, the soft, melodious music adds on to the serenity in the restaurant. Yantra also serve lunch buffet priced just 25++per person which you notice on the table display card which is very affordable price considering the location of the restaurant.For starters I tried Lamb Chops which was remarkably tasty; it was nice and juicy but not too spicy. Alongside order for Yantra Lassi which was made of yogurt and hint of rose flavour which was excellent and I never knew that rose flavouring would actually go well with yogurt but it totally blew me off.I order lamb rogan josh for my main course which was mild spicy curry and they have some really nice flavour naans and I choose to order chilli cheese naan because it is not too spicy even with chilli added and cheese was really moist.Ended my meal with the all time famous Indian sweets Gulab Jamun which are milk dumpling soaked in rose flavour syrup, yes as sweet as sounds and it tasted extraordinary sweet too but it doesn‚Äôt hurt to indulge once in a while really.I think Yantra definitely has to be one of my favourite Indian restaurants because it is affordable and really worth of course once in a while, if you can afford to spend more definitely try having wider many spread ranging from the starters till their desserts. It will only make you want to go back there again
2
Went for a special evening dinner and was really looking forward to the meal as I had stumbled on this place a couple of years ago and was very much looking forward to re acquainting myself with the food again. I knew this place was towards the high end price wise for a Indian but I was more then prepared for that. Service was quite frankly lack lustre and the seating position against the wall was one where you actually sank down into the seat and ended up with your chin level to the table edge...ok ok, an exaggeration but you get what I mean :-) anyway I asked for another table and this request was accomodate in the nearly empty restaurant. The wait for the food was acceptable however the food itself was in my opinion not spiced correctly as it seemed heavily reliant on black pepper and believe me when I say I know my curry's. The nan belonged to the flat bread variety which was disappointing for such a high end restaurant, needless to say we did not stop for desert. Another thing that did stick in my mind and this is not food related was when I asked for the wi-fi password from the waiter, I was given it and when another diner behind me asked (a lone diner who sat behind me about 30 minutes into our meal) for it he was denied it by the waiter who stated that it was a wi-fi service only for the restaurant, that really made me feel uncomfortable. Anyway this place is not a restaurant that I will be going back to on my next visit to Singapore as I am sure there better out there food and atmosphere wise
5
My husband and I didn't book a table but they were able to get a table for us. The restaurant has a great atmosphere, decorated very nicely and the service was good. There is a lot to choose from. My husband and I would go back again. You have the option to sit inside or outside
1
I was at the Yantra with my colleague and when we entered there was nobody to attend. There was another family which came and they also started waiting for somebody to come and attend. After 10 minutes of waiting we went inside and then one waitress came and asked us to wait while she can check with the manager about availability (They need a manager approval for that). We waited again for 20 minutes when there was no response then we went inside and this waitress came again very rudely said "No we do not have any place" when we asked why she could not tell us in the first place she said "Sorry" in the rudest possible manner and went away.I know the food is good as I ate here last year and that time also I had felt the behavior was very bad
4
We tend to be a little more demanding with our native cuisine / restaurant, but even so I would rate Yantra's food highly. The kababs were done to perfection ( and well done as requested ) as was the raan. The black dal though very flavourful was a trifle rich. The papadums are served liberally. And when I asked for raw cut onions, they were readily served fresh with fresh green chillis, as we natives like it !! Yes their service is wanting, but the service is also not that bad to skip this restaurant just for this minor flaw. Being a fine dining restaurant makes us a little more demanding on the service aspect and rightly so, but honestly it is not that bad, if only they'd be a wee bit more conscious about it. In any case, whatever they lack in service they make up with their fabulous ambient music, it is outstanding !
4
Everything except the location. In fact we almost missed it. But once we sat on the table, we enjoyed the food and service.
4
Yantra is one of the very few restaurants in Singapore(located in Tanglin Mall) which offers authentic Indian food.It has some traditional and exotic options for non vegetarian dishes. The vegetarian dishes are good as well but one has limited options and some popular vegetarian dishes cannot be found in this restaurant.Positives:Great taste,Authentic Food Negatives:Very Expensive(A La Carte Food for 2 without drinks could be SGD 70++)Limited options for vegetarian tandoor starters and curriesService can be slow and is pretty inconsistentPls do try and make a reservation for a table especially on weekend
1
Had my Niece ROM. The waiter served waiter after half an hour after being told to do so. They were not sure how and what to do during an event. One or two waiter were good, rest were worse. At 3pm, party ending, only two female waiters around, rest of male waiters disappeared extremely fast.Faster then superman..Like did not care of bothered to walk around and see what was required by the guest..Disappointed Service level for s top notch restaurant
5
I stumbled upon this restaurant by accident - tucked away in a corner of the Tanglin Mall. They were advertising a Sunday champagne brunch so I booked on the spot. The restaurant decor is stunning and modern. The staff are polished and attentive. The food is absolutely stunning - a great selection of choices - all the normal favorites plus many modern takes on the traditional. They offer three price options - free flow soft drinks, free flow wine & beer or free flow champagne, wine and beer. Champagne goes very well with Indian food. It is the wine lover's equivalent of beer with this type of meal - cold and bubbly. I have been to the brunch twice now. The first time I chose the champagne option but I enjoyed the food so much that I didn't drink that much champagne. The second time I went I chose the wine and beer option. I think in terms of value that is the best option. Just love this place
3
Went for a business meeting with associates. Food was good but the waiting staff seems as if they are doing us a favor. Buffet spread was very good though having lot of masala in some dishes which could be avoided. Nice desserts Why do they make you wait when there are so many tables available ... Staff is ruining the whole experience ! Missed the 5 stars due to staff and masala !
2
We went to this restaurant as it was recommended by a friend. The service was extremely bad, we were left waiting in reception for a table even though we had booked. The service staff were very unfriendly, we had to ask several times for a drinks menu and when they finally took the order they brought my husbands drink but mine didn't arrive until after the food despite reminding them. We were made to feel like we were annoying them by being in their restaurant. There were certainly enough staff but they just weren't interested in actually doing anything. It's a real shame as the food was actually very good. I feel sorry for the kitchen staff as their hard work and attention to detail is being completely undermined by poor front of house. We definitely won't be back.

Yantra is about as good as any mid tier restaurant in the UK. It's not amazing. But then it's all relative to Singapore which is limited in its culinary offerings. Pros: buffet is reasonable in quality and price. Avoid eating here at other times unless you want to remortgage.Cons: who fries their tandoori chicken when, by definition, it should be cooked in a tandoor? Apparently, Yantra does.

Yantra has earned the dubious distinction of being my first restaurant review post for all the wrong reasons. I have been going there for many years but never have I seen such a diabolical slide in service standards, as has occured with Yantra over the 2-3 years. You will note from the other reviewers here, that the service in the restaurant is appallingly poor and I would only add that it is unacceptably poor for a restaurant that purports to be a fine dining experience. Each of my last 5-10 visits have been exasperating: noone will attend to you at the reception thereby forcing you to walk into the dining area to ask for a table and then being told they need time to set up your table, despite the restaurant being less than half full; even then, at times, the manager and his staff would simply forget that you are waiting for a table at his half empty restaurant - on a good day, after 15 mins of waiting and 3-4 reminders to the staff, you will be lucky to get a table at this half empty restaurant (once I was turned away at 9pm and told last orders were over) The most galling thing is that the service staff are clearly out of their depth and completely disinterested in serving their customers. The manager generally walks around like a deer in the headlights, exhibiting an incompetence rarely seen in Singapore. But the experience only gets worse from there - you might need to wrestle the staff to get a menu and place your order. The service staff have made an art form of faffing around, without attending to any of the tables; they appear completely disinterested in serving customers. I am a fan of the food - which is very good (albeit over-priced), but I am hoping the harsh words here would jolt the owners of the restaurant (and if we are lucky the manager) into taking the right steps to arrest the shambolic situation - I don't see any attempt by the restaurant in addressing some of the negative reviews here and perhaps that's representative of their service ethos in general. Its a real shame because, the dining experience in Yantra about 5 years ago, was excellent - with attentive, keen and professional service staff, making you feel that the overpriced meal you had was justified (if not, well worth it) - the Yantra 5 years ago would get top marks. The Yantra today, is losing more fans by the minute than Man Utd. And from the looks of it, it doesn't look like they care

I went for a business lunch to this place and found the food and interior to be good. Looks like an upscale restaurant and the buffet was great too with good options. We all enjoyed the food from chicken tikka to aloo chaat and the main course was good as well.The female waitress stands out from rest of the staff as she was very attentive in serving breads and cleaning plates, rest of the staff was either slow or not interested.I will definitely visit the place again as I found the ambiance and food living upto my expectations

Ate here with 2 work colleges from India for dinner. Ate a number of appetizers and mains (all veg) which were really great! They team commented on who nice it was to find good, authentic Indian food outside of India. However, the service was extremely poor. We had many staff pass our table without clearing plates after we had clearly finished, the same issue after mains finished. We then waiting for 15 minutes AFTER somebody had taken our credit card before we were able to pay and leave. We had to prompt them before we actually received the bill
3
The restaurant's ambience is good but it's not worth the cost.
Food is very expensive and quqlity is also not so good.
Also waiting time is too much.
4
Sunday brunches are really something here and excellent value for whats on offer. Generally kids friendly as well, with good wait staff.Dinner service can be a bit slow for the a la carte, and considerably higher priced, and deduct a star for value on that account
3
We went for weekend buffet.Almost everything was average or below average w.r.t taste.Some dishes like mutton had a strange oily after-taste.Jalebi was exceptionally good & ambience was ok. Decent atmosphere for a weekend meal - only if food was better or price lower.Not worth the price or hype
4
I visit Yantra whenever I come to Singapore. Its a place to have good cooked Indian food. This time I went for dinner around 9.20pm with my brother. A few tables were occupied. Delivery of food was very slow and getting the drinks taking 20 minutes is a lot for such a beautiful restaurant. The food is worth the wait. Remember this is a pricey place. Its not a budget restaurant. You must have deep pockets to go here
3
Ate at Yantra last night. No one there at the desk when we arrived, no apologies for keeping us waiting. Food wasn't bad but certainly wasn't great. No checking by the staff if everything was OK or if we enjoyed the meal (half of which was left) or not. Paid nearly $300 ($90 bottle of wine) for two people. And all this for a restaurant in a shopping mall! Won't be heading back anytime soon
5
Simply brilliant food. As an English guy Indian food is a staple. Yantra is fantastic! Open kitchen so you can see the quality. Service is great as they don't rush you. The mixed appetizer is unreal. And they will make dishes as spicy as you want to order. Wonderful place
5
Yantra is my go to place for north Indian food, their buffets on Saturdays and Sundays are the best VFM meals in S'pore for Indian food. The spread on Saturdays is limited, but the prices are adjusted so. Sundays is the full fare, chaats, kababs, biryanis, a couple of non-vegetarian main courses and to top it up a live jalebi counter. You can opt for free flow of wines by adding another $15 to the price. So when the time came for me to treat my Indian friends (with a few vegetarians in the group) the choice was pretty simple. Though I would like to highlight that the service qualities have dipped a bit (but I guess most restaurants are facing this problem). Do remember to order your breads/naans well in advance else you may have to wait a while before they are served at your table. This rating and review is for the several meals that I've eaten at Yantra but in particularly related to the most recent visit with 17 of us when we were served well. I have been for dinner only once and concur with the other reviewers that the prices are very high and not justified when the same quality food is served for lunches at a more reasonable price
5
While my wife and I have only tried their weekend brunch on Saturdays, I must say its been simply amazing each time we have been. A generous selection of food, and at am amazing price. Nan and soft drinks included ... and to tie things off at the end, incredible ice cream.You really must try this restaurant, specially on the weekday or weekend brunches
3
Unfortunately we came away from a dinner at Yantra feeling a little disappointed. We went on a Friday night to have dinner. The restaurant was busy but as far as we could tell there were only 3-4 waiters on service. It took a long time for us to be seated - and it was only when I pointed out that my wife is heavily pregnant did they start getting a table ready for us (even though there were quite a few tables free!). The frustrating did not stop there - we had to wait a long time for the order to be taken, we were not offered any popodams and had to ask, and we were sat down for almost an hour before our starter arrived and waited 30min at least between courses - which was too long. It's a shame because the food is excellent - truly some of the best North Indian cuisine I have had for a long time. Hoping next time I can come back and give a higher rating.
5
They have great North Indian Vegetarian and non veg food available here. We had the Aloo Tiki Channa chaat for starters and paneer makani for mains. Their selection of Naans has to be some of the best I have ever seen on a Menu, such as Blue Cheese Naan, Mushroom Naan, olive naan and sundried tomato naan. We had the mushroom naan and it was full of flavour that we felt we didnt need to accompany it with a gravy! Next time will definitely try the blue cheese naan. The service was very good and the waiter advised us on what to eat. There is a discount for AMEX car holders so pay with that if you dine here. I would highly recommend to book before going as you will be disappointed. There is also a lunch time buffet that I will be trying very soon
5
Went there for the Saturday brunch, we were seated and the food was delicious, all the dishes had their own distinctions. Service was good. Surroundings were nice.
4
Great North Indian food...had A la carte. Though bit heavy on pockets, the food was delicious. Excellent service, a great place for family dining. Decor and Ambience is great. Vegetarian friendly and variety of options available.
4
Food was quite delicious. The presentation was also nice. The quantity was perfect. Try out the hyderabadi biryani.
4
I have eaten here several times over the past year for lunch. The food has always remained very good quality & the selections at the lunch buffet are impressive for the price point. I have never left this place feeling unfulfilled or unsatisfied. Definitely call to book ahead as they can booked up. In addition, their special buffet pricing is Mon-Thu only. Lastly, I would not recommend this place for families with young children...just not a great setup for them
1
Have been a regular but they have really deteriorated after the new menu. Yes..the prices are stupidly high...food quality and quantity bad...second time went for dinner but no more...(lunch buffet is the only option if you want to go..they cream the diners to make up for lunch buffet)...hair in the food..aloo tikki was terrible...broccolli cheese ( $ 31)...was yucky....paneer makhani in a local south indian restaurant in Serangoon will be better.Sad to see another good restaurant go down the drain in quality and raise prices(Tandoor at Holiday inn went the same way but these guys are wrose). Time to close up guys. If you think an expensive and colourful menu will fool the regulars..it won'tsorry to be harsh...but this is from a regular customer who has been coming atleast once a month for years. BTW on a saturday evening most tables were empty compared to what used to be a very busy plac
3
Stopped by for a lunch on a weekend, took ala carte instead of the buffet, ordered three simple dishes with some nans and a soft drink, price SGD 148, pretty steep for such a place and lunch for two. The buffet was adequately priced. Suggest never order ala carte at the Yantra. The service was very good staff were courteous and responsive
4
After a disastrous visit to Dan Ryan close by we tried for the first time Yantra and do not regret it.We were a bit early and thus had a good choice of fresh food.We were positively surprised of the quality , the fresh food the taste and also good service.We are coming back
5
I have been living in Singapore for the past few years and been dining out regularly with family and friends, but somehow never dined at Yantra (was actually not aware of it, until a colleague gave a strong recommendation (he went there the previous weekend to celebrate his 10th Wedding Anniversary). What I liked is the location (inside the Tanglin Mall in Orchard), the serene ambience and indeed the spread of Indian Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian options. There were three to four sets of sweets/desserts that were offered during the course of 1 - 2 hours that we were present (something that I felt was very unique and sweet :)). Another important aspect is the personal hospitality offered by the Chief Chef! I am taking my family soon!

Based on raves on TA, I selected Yantra for a small meet up of 3 persons. Our mistake was we did not reserve & though we arrived at 12 noon, the only seats available were outside, near a construction crane. No issue with that as the work was not going on and it was quite breezy. And as it turned out, the seating was probably the best part of our meal. The waiter who attended us at the reception was disinterested (and I am being nice here). The lady who attended us at the table was worse. We were served water after half an hour and though we were told that we will get naans at our table, we had to ask after 45 minutes. The naans & chapati was tough & undercooked and we had to specifically ask for butter naan. The variety of dishes is extremely limited for a buffet and almost all gravies seem to have a similar base. Paneer was nice, but the chicken & mutton just average. Desserts were terrible. No idea what they served in name of ice-cream, but it had a very strong taste of artificial essence & was bitter. All in all a very disappointing meal. Glad I checked out the buffet before taking my family for an expensive dinner in this restaurant. I would really have to be desperate to visit again
4
Whenever I come to Singapore I would go to Yantra for really well cooked Indian food. The lunch which is a buffet is excellent. Its value for money and the food is fresh which is something I look for.
5
the food and the service was very good,the place is in orchard road .all the dishes,are good.we had the buffet
3
We went on a recommendation, but I was disappointed that Saturday lunch was limited to the buffet and no a la carte. I was not that hungry and always take too much at a buffet. Luckily for me the choice was, I felt, rather limited. Highlights of the starters were the tandoori prawns in a light sauce and the tandoori veg kebab. Actually I don't think there was much else! Maybe a mushroom dish and some salads...the choice of mains seemed to be chicken in many ways - biryani, a Murgh makhani, some veg curries - sweetcorn and paneer (run out) and dhal. Fish curry was rather flavorless and overlooked. But no other meat that I could find - surely we could have had some lamb? The price for the buffet was $25 and a glass of Sauvignon black $21. Yikes! Getting the bill took an age. A neighbour told us the Indian buffet at the Pan Pacific hotel is better. Will try that next time and perhaps stick to Little India for a la carte if these prices are anything to go by
2
Outstanding food though used to be better with the previous chef. Pricey - prices like a top end Indian restaurant in London but only because of the half baked service. Service - walk in visit with a colleague. Asked if we had a reservation and we were told here was no table and a 45 minute wait. Then within 5 minutes a table was available and no one had walked out!! 3 out of the 6 veg starters were not available - I mean are you serious this is an Indian restaurant and most folks would like some veg food. No quick refresh of plates between courses. Had to be asked to refresh plates. Cold cutlery with warm food - should I be teaching them front of house skills??Had to ask for a fork twice and then get it from another table. Starters arrived at different times with at least a 5 minute wait. Told by the waiters that service charge though charged was not given to staff. Shame but they really did not deserve any tip. Also did not understand my question when I asked whether service charge was optional. I asked the question to at least three staff and their question should have been "was there anything wrong with the service?" If the food was not as good as it is I would not bother going there.
3
The menu entices you with perfect presentations of traditional Indian dishes. But look at the prices and you will do a double take. This is by far the dearest Indian restaurant I have been to in Singapore. We had the mixed platter as a starter. It was good. Especially the sheema kebab. For main course I took the mutton rogan josh. It arrived in a bowl - enough for two people to be fair - but it was mostly sauce with a few pieces of tough meat. The rice was good as was the nan bread. All in all you can't fault the food or the service but why such high prices
3
No doubt its an expansive restaurant. But, if food and service is good i don't mind spending. My review is based on two visits to yantra. First time i had buffet on Saturday. Some dishes are good(like, grilled prawns, biryani) and some of them are just average. Second time, me and my husband went for a special menu. Its was by some chef from mumbai. Chaats, chana bhatura, stuffed prathans and all. It was expensive. We ordered 'paneer paratha', 'dahi vada' and 'mumbai ragda'.Pratha came.. And was really good but with VERY tiny portion of dal and raita (just about 2 spoons). Dahi wada came, again very small portion. But, was good. Then we waited and waited for mumbai ragda and it did not came. We asked them twice but, nothing came on our table. After 20 mins one of the waiter came and asked if we have ordered for bhatura chana (which we did not ordered). Again, we asked him to get us mumbai ragda(what we actually ordered). Waited for more 15 mins. By the time we were fed up waiting and asked them to cancel rest of the order. So, i would recommend yantra only for buffet but, absolutely not for al carte. All because of poor service
3
Had lunch there today with two children. A very good range of interesting food for adults, but very limited choice for children and no indication on dishes of heat level. Staff seem bit confused and it would have helped for someone to explain the detail of the buffet at the start. For example free flow of soft drink included (we had tap water). You can also pay extra for free flow of wine etc. I had to look up the web site afterwards to find that out. $49 for adults and $30 for kids, plus 10% service, plus GST is a bit much particularly for the kids. They would have been better off in the food court downstairs
4
Located in a upscale mall, this is one of the few Indian fine dining places in Singapore. Scores well in all aspects......ambience, taste, presentation. Another high selling point is the delicious lunch buffet, definitely one of the best Indian buffets in Singapore. Service was a little slow on one of the dinner nights but that could be attributed to a big party next table. Price is a little on the higher side however worth a visit
5
We have gone here a couple of times for special occasions as it is a bit pricey. At first I was worried thinking a restaurant at a mall would not be memorable but not Yantra. The decor was great, the service spot on and the food incredible (although I am not an expert on Indian cuisine). The nice thing to is that their menu includes pictures of all their dishes (done in a tasteful way). I would take friends here in a heartbeat
4
I come often to Singapore and I always visit or take a takeaway from Yantra. This place is not cheap, it's expensive but the food is excellent. You will find this place busy for dinner most if the time. Try the vegetarian platter which has the kebabs and the soft rich paneer. Ambience if the place is lovely. Location is great too which is in the tanglin mall. Would recommend this place if you do not have money issue
4
If money is not a concern than it is a good restaurent but stay away if u r looking for a $50 dinner with your girlfriend. For 2 person, it will easily cost you 100. Otherwise, food is good.
3
Yantra is located to the mall next to the Traders hotel. It is an upscale Thai restaurant with decent food but overpriced. The position themselves as a premium restaurant but over do it I feel and you can find better Thai food nearby at far better prices. This is not to say that this is a bad restaurant, I had a nice dinner there but feel that the prices do not reflect the quality
5
Yantra is in the Tanglin Mall and can be called as a fine dine Indian Restaurant where you can entertain clients or go for a formal dinner.. or just go to enjoy great Indian food. It is a tad bit expensive, but the food and service is great. Lunch Buffet though is very reasonably priced - Monday to Thursday. On friday / saturdays there is of course a different buffet at a different price.. Sunday brunch has a lavish spread and there are various packages that one can choose... Dinner is a la carte and definitley the best for a relaxed evening. While I enjoy my vegetarian meal and the extra sweet dessert of gulabjamuns, my colleagues like the Raan yantra and the Prawn dish with is flamed on your table and seemed to be their signature dish
5
Great indian restaurant, by all angles.Service is absolutely ok, good wines and outstanding food !Can't miss the lamb flambee... Delicious, tender and a nice show (will post pics)Price is on the high side (we paid 130 Sin$ per person, abt 100 US$), quite in line with Singapore standard and absolutely ok with what you ge
2
This time we tried for weekday lunch. Food still relatively good and reasonably priced (week day lunch). But the staff, normally slow, now even slower and not attentive. Between courses, for example, would remove plates and also yet untouched basket of naan breads without even asking (where they trying to upsell more later?). At the end of the meal the waiter brought a feedback form asking us to return it at the exit. It was pre-filled by the staff with all boxes marked "Excellent"...! Yeah, right....small details, but a pity that a place with nice ambiente, good location and good food is diluted by poorly trained staff with wrong attitude. The owner might want to take a look
4
We visited Yantra over the weekend for lunch. The restaurant is has beautiful ambience with a small extended outdoor seating. Before we could start to explore the buffet, we were presented with complimentary platter of indian snack delicacies, and those were really good at taste. The buffet, itself wasn't very extensive, but nice to eat. The chicken and lamb dishes were bit disappointing, but vegetarian dishes were surprisingly good. The best part of the meal were dessert offerings, with Gulab-Jamun and Jalebis prepared at the buffet counter itself and served hot. You won't find many restaurants in Singapore, which offer Jalebis, this hot and this crisp. The only negative factor for me was that staff wasn't too friendly and arrangement seemed a bit unorganized. But apart from that, we were happy to have visited this place
4
Food was very nice... type is buffet and for 2 persons approx cost will be 60But it is worth it... Sweets and dishes was very tasty .. worth visiting if you are in Singapore.. SuggestionShould have a board at the entrance updating customers to have a seat and some will come and and check.. as once we entered we did not weather we need to go or wait no one was at the reception...
5
I've been lucky enough to visit and eat in several Singapore restaurants, and far too many Indian restaurants around the world. This was just great, considering it was a lunchtime buffet in a shopping mall. The atmosphere was great, decor stylish, service attentive and food excellent - a winning combination IMO.
4
I didn't have the highest expectations of this place as it's a buffet inside a shopping mall, but it turned out to be excellent. The food was great - a huge variety of both and vegetarian dishes and all of it excellent. It's beautiful on the inside and service was great
5
This restaurant is in the Tanglin Mall - friends of ours live very close to it or we would not have know about it. We went in for the fixed price lunch and it was really fantastic. The food was delicious, great selection of dishes too. Good service. Would recommend it
4
Yantra is hard to find but well worth the visit. The north indian menu has something for everyone with or without the ¬®bite. Service is excellent and staff very helpfull, Good wine list:
4
Offers 25 dishes for S$25 buffet lunch....
Good variety of North Indian food in a well appointed setting with access from Tangling Mall.
Well worth a visit when at the top of Orchard Road, whether with family, friends or business colleagues ...

The buffet spread at Yantra never fails to please one's palate - especially if you are looking out for hot and spicy Indian food.We tried the buffet on Sunday (Mothers' Day Special?). It was priced at S$ 49++. There were 3 vegetarian appetizers and 3 non-vegetarian. In addition there was a separate counter that was preparing "chaat" and mini "chole bhature" that was brilliant. The bhature infact was almost similar to the Bengali "luchi" - the more enterprising bengalis could even have that and the rogan josh on the main course for the quintessential bengali "mangsho luchi" experience.Which bring us to the main course - there were 2 non-veg dishes, one dal, 2 vegetarian mains and 2 different rice varieties - one veg the other non-veg. The drigeur pickles and raitas were also there. Apart from the general problem of most of the dishes being a bit too "hot" - a teeny weeny bit mind you - just a tad lesser and things would have been perfect - the mutton rogan josh and the chicken biriyani could have been better. The mutton was a trifle hard and the curry was a bit lacklustre. The quality of the meat can also be improved upon. The chicken biriyani would warm the hearts of those who savour and drool on the Lucknow / Calcutta variety - the taste was however quite bland. This can certainly be worked upon. The dessert section I would say was literally the icing on the cake - the jalebis were mouth watering - they had just the right bit of tanginess in the sweet lumps / nodes where the circles meet - the right balance of sweet and a hint of "khatta" - to use the perfect hindi word. The buffet comes with soft drinks included - on this day the "aam panna" was very nice. The one other thing about the buffet is the variety - we went to Yantra twice over a 2 month period and about 80% of the menu was the same. The taste however, was overall quite good.The maitre'd was extremely helpful and courteous - he asked us twice if everything was ok. This is despite the restaurant being full. most of the staff were friendly. There was just this one Punjabi lady (waitress) who serves you with a bit of a glum face. She looks very severe and can actually put you off - this has happened to me earlier - her vibes appear to be extremely unwilling to serve you - almost a favour. The restaurant also seems to be a bit understaffed for the sort of crowd it attracts - can take a while to get served. We never bother with this as we always go for the buffet. The cracks in the service levels do appear however, when you ask for drinks or something extra. Maybe a bit more training can help?Decor and ambience wise we rather like the place - just the right bit if light coming in during the day. Very lively and loud (as in volume levels) as you would expect in a typical Indian restaurant with Indian clientele. A happy atmosphere. The bar and the alfresco area looks good although in Singapore weather, I really dont know when the latter would be a welcome option. Overall, very good value for money and would love to repeat
1
The decor was very classy and modern. The menu card very helpful with beautiful photos of the food. Dishes themselves were nothing to rave about, but highlight was the way we were treated by the staff when we made one comment on a drink. He rolled his eyes, snatched the bill off my hands and threw it to his cashier. We feel sorry for the owners of that restaurant, his staff is wasting his investment
4
So we heard this to be "the best Indian Restaurant as voted by the Indian community". It was very good, but the prices are excessive. Ambiance is sophisticated luxurious but the service is mediocre (been on weekend dinner, should be the best). Despite many waiters everywhere, they were not attentive, slow, one could not take the order, the other one forgot. At the end, after having asked for the check 4 four times, just stood up and paid at the exit (and there were other parties waiting to get a table). So go for the food (if ok to overpay, but dining is mainly about the food, right?), but not for the rest
2
Wanted to go to a good resturant for a special ocassion and chose this one on recommendation from a friend.+ve - Good abience, very nice menu with very tempting dishes, some dishes looked unique as well.-ve - Bad service. Long waits even though the resturant was not too busy. We had a 3 year old daughter and we had to ask 3 times seperately to get plate, glass, cutlery for her. You would think that they would have taken the hint after the first ask itself. We ordered Vegeterian dishes and food was average by our taste. I have had much better food in little india for 1/5th the price.Not even close to being value for money
5
It was my farewell party and we were a large group - 20 odd people. Frankly speaking I have never tasted vegetarian appetizers this good. I can't recall the last time(I think this was a first) when I went back to the vegetarian section of a restaurant to take second helpings. The deserts were also my favourites - Gajar ka halwa and mango rasmalai. Will definitely be back again
4
Deeply ensconced -practically hard to find- "Yantra" in SG's Tanglin Mall offers a seductive and sophisticated atmosphere for enjoying skillfully prepared high-end Indian specialties. The decor is elegant, dark and attractive and the service is attentive. But the bottom line is overpriced food and drink for a very contrived ambience
2
Food is good if you order ala carte. Lunch buffet is attractively priced but very average. What spoilt our experience was the poor service and rude staff. If budget is not an issue, Rang Mahal or Punjab grill would offer better service, food and ambience any day
4
Yantra has one of the best lamb galauti kebabs i have eaten anywhere in the world. Apart from that a very extensive menu at a decent price. Chef chintan is innovative and ready to cook things off menu which suite your pallette. Pleasant interiors. The only thing missing maybe a good view.
4
Great food, good service, great ambience.
Tried vegetarian food only. A bit too rich, for my taste, I felt
5
I aling with my family had been to the weekend buffet lunch.
Excellent Indian spread and the quality of each and every dish is beyond description.. have to really have the food to enjoy it.
Highly recommended if you love quality Indian food.
5
My wife and I were reccomended to eat at Yantra by the concierge at the 4 Seasons. We enjoyed the most delicious marinated fish tandoori and baked brinjal curry. Service was excellent. Expensive however.
5
We(myself, wife and my 1 year daughter), visited this place to have nice lunch on my daughter's first birthday, very are vegetarian and we had high hopes from this restaurant based on the positive reviews we have seen on Trip Advisor, As such, they have kept the service standard high and had a very good option for both Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian.Salad & FruitsStarters - 2/3 Veg, and 2 Non VegMain Course - 2 Veg & 3 Non VegRice - Both Veg and Non Veg BiryaniDessert - best of all, Gulab Jamum, Fruit Salad and KheerAll an all....everything for everyone... to suit all types of customer, even my kid likes the food.and all this pleasure for only S$19.90++ with friendly service.I would definitely recommend this restaurant for atleast 1 visit in a quarter...Simply worth It.To Restaurant Manager and Chief Chef, Please keep the Food Quality/Selection/Price as is.. Good Job:
4
Good variety of starters and mains and exceptionally good deserts particularly the Jalebi`s.Relaxed casual atmosphere and the place is usually buzzing with People of Indian origin, which is generally a good indication that the food is authentic.If anything their main section could be more imaginative.will be back soo
5
My family and I are very frequent visitors to Yantra.The decor is basic but elegant. It's great to have a 'nice looking' Indian restaurant to take guests to finally. We've had the chance to experience the buffets as well as the A La Carte menu.The buffets are great value for money and the Sunday buffet is absolutely the best option. A La Carte tends to be expensive but that is to be expected.The true speciality of Yantra is their stunning Kababs. In my view, the Gaulati Kabab I've had here is simply the best that I've tried anywhere. The variety of Chicken Kababs and the Sheeks are absolutely superb. My wife swears by their tandoor prawns.On Sundays, they also have an absolutely superb chaat service. I'd highly recommend the Aloo Tikki.The gravy dishes are a bit of a hit and miss. There's a Chicken Tikka Masala variant that they do infrequently at the buffet which is absolutely delicious. Its one dish that I always try to have if we are going A La Carte.The biryanis are great too. The mutton biryani is a bit better than the othersThe only average cusine is the desserts but these have been improving. The icing on the cake is the freshly made Jalebis. On occassions, the Gulab Jamuns are pretty nice. If you are going A La Carte, don't miss the Paan Kulfi.The service is a bit average though. If Chintan is around, he takes absolutely superb care of the guests, but the general wait staff could be a bit more responsive.This is the place to go to for a great mea

We arrived just after 6.30 with no reservation on a Saturday evening but were welcomed and given a choice of where to sit. The menu had plenty of choice and each dish is shown so you have some idea of what you are getting. We were given a choice of still or sparkling water - I chose still and we got mineral water from Italy- I noticed later that locals were given tap water. Our water cost 10SD. The starters were good and well presented. The mains were tasty but were just bowls of chicken or lamb in a thick sauce - no special presentation. The Naans were good. After we had kulfi which came in a bowl over a goblet of dry ice. With two beers and a tonic water the bill came to 270SD or √Ç¬£130. That is what dinner for two would cost us in a one star Michelin in France with wine. Other people have mentioned the buffet lunch and it seems really good value at 19SD so I would recommend going for lunch as it is worth a visit but not worth the price we paid in the evening
4
I have been twice to this place.once for a networking meetup ..and the follow up was my desire to try their biryani againhave tried few of their starters mushroom ,Prawns & Chicken kebabs are really awesome.biryani is something that stands out i liked the dum biryani very much just perfect.Price wise yes little on high side but taste wise its probably among the top 5 destinations in Singapore for north Indian foodoverall if you like north Indian food this is a place worth tryingCheer
4
We visited yantra today for the popular Sunday brunch for the first time. Have visited them for a la carte dinner earlier as well and food does taste great and is one of the best Indian fare in Singapore. For $50. The brunch is not cheap but the spread is decent and tastes excellent even from buffet food standards...good choice starters and indian desserts. However the inattentive service left a lot to be desired. Even though there were few guests due to Chinese New Year weekend, the staff was nowhere to be found for performing simple tasks like clearing plates and serving breads...for buffer settings, one doesn't expect much service apart from plates being regularly replaced and breads being served on time! Full marks to the chef though...just improve the service a little bit... Few smiles here and there would help guests a little bit more welcome

We went to this restaurant and had Aloo Tikki chat, Yantra Paneer Tikka for starters and they were just delicious and well presented too!! For the mains we had rumali roti and daal..the roti's were soft and nicely presented. Will surely go back again!!People at Yantra...surely know the success mantra!!

This a gem of a restaurant, great Indian food not too pretentious. Staff is very courteous always going the extra mile. Will go there whenever in s'pore

Good experience.. Weekday lunches are cheap and nice, but the week-end brunches are truly great.. Nice ambiance...

I can't speak for their dinner offerings, but my wife and I found the service at Yantra's to be good, the food to be excellent! The price sounded a little high for a buffet at $25, but that was only slightly more than we paid at Nando's on the other end of the mall the previous day, for food that wasn't anywhere near the quality of Yantra's. As we were leaving, they were putting up a new sign that put the lunch buffet at $19 each Monday through Thursday, so it's an even better deal now! I've eaten a lot of Indian food...much of it in India. This is some of the best I've had. I'm not sure how you could leave unhappy after spending some time here, at least from a quality-of-food standpoint. Delicious

Really good tasty Indian food, in a very nice setting, but you have to pay extra for all that. Therefore best for business or for a special treat. The food really is excellent and the breads hot and doughy. Highly recommended, but bring your boss to pay or your wife for a special day

Went to Yantra with a colleague of mine who wanted to try Indian, the food was average at best. the issue was more with the service. we had a female server, I don't quite remember her name and she was pointblank rude and absolutely inattentive.Worst is they gave us a really bad table even though most of the place was emptythe place is a little pricey, I would have tried it again as sometimes the choice of dishes is what makes or breaks a place's opinion, but wont try it again just because of the bad service
3
I went to Yantra with my colleagues for dinner. The food and ambiance was great, however, the service was lacking. The restaurant wasn't even fully occupied and the waiters were already struggling. Secondly, the aircon is switched off at around 9.30ish.. We realized the restaurant is in a mall and the central cooling system is shut down, however, it was quite uncomfortable to eat spicy indian food when it is soo hot. We enjoyed the food, especially their Dhuan Ghosht, but couldnt order their desserts because the kitchen closes at 9.30 which again was surprising to us since it is an indian restaurant. Overall, I will go bak to Yantra again but for Lunch this time
5
They have a very good buffet. Very high quality, not an extensive menu (weekends are bigger) but everything they have there is very good.I especially like their kebabs, biryani and desserts. The ambience is very good and like what I would expect to see at a five star hotel in India

I first ate the Sunday lunch buffet @ Yantra and I've gone back again and again for it. I've never eaten there on any other day or had anything a la carte. Now that the disclaimer is over...The chaat, the non-veg starters, the main course everything in excellent in Sunday lunch buffet terms of taste, variety and preparation, flavour and the tenderness of the meats. I have one stipulation when going for the lunch, they must have chola bhatura on the Sunday menu. Their chola bhatura is very very good esp. with the ginger and green chilly. The mini aalu tikkis are fried in butter and are melt in the mouth. The chat counter also has sev puri, papdi chaat, bhel and so on, all the usual chaat stuff. On and they also have ragda (with the aalu tikkis).Then there are some free drinks, last time I went was lovely aam panna and thandai - good stuff. In hot starters there are 3 veg and 3 non-veg starters, I am partial to non-veg and the chicken malai tikka was complete melt-in-the-mouth, I haven't tasted such tender chicken. One other time there was the most excellent tandoor lamb chops - again tender as heaven. Then there are tandoori prawns - huge sized prawns, not the small ones. Main course usually has equal number of veg and non veg curries - the black daal is excellent (I am overly fond of black dal), the fish curries are excellent, the gosht dum biryani is excellent. Chicken and mutton curries are okay.For desert, there is hot freshly made jelebis! I know people are crazy about this and I am sure its nice, but I don't eat sweets, so no comments from me on how good it is. I do know that there are always 5-6 deserts. And of course there are fruits.They also have a lovely tea collection, which we always get after the lunch to help digest the over-indulgence. There is a gold tea, which is subtle and excellent (to be had without milk)
2
Looked really nice and staff are friendly. Good looking menu full colour pics but it was or last day in Singapore and what spoiled the evening was the chicken on 1 of our starters was raw. And some where warm not piping hot just like the main courses. Which killed our appetite. Staff and manager apologised but it was to late. Would not eat here again. Which is a shame because it had potential to be very good
4
Yantra at the Tanglin Mall was a delightful surprise. Tucked away in a cul-de-sac on the first floor of the mall, the entrance is almost discrete. You actually see the entrance to the bar/lounge first. The ambience is a purple haze velvet lounge. The brushed steel tandoors stand in a neat row behind glass, holding court over the spacious main dining room. We had the enormous square table right next to these ornate giant ovens. The food was surprisingly robust and sometimes even rustic and certainly exceeded the expectations of what would be on offer in such fine surroundings. The appetizers of spiced flat-bread and mint-yogurt dip set the stage for hearty chunks of succulent tandoori chicken and juicy stuffed mushrooms. Palak Paneer, creamy spinach cradling chunky morsels of cheese followed by tandoori prawns with their shells and just lightly charred and accompanied by the de rigeur garlic and plain naans were all unashamedly bold and hearty. Noticeably absent was the big-plate-small-portion pretense of "con-Fusion" cuisine. A flavor-loaded big wet French kiss in this bed of crushed velvet and mood lighting...and I enjoyed every single sloppy wet moment.The service lagged a little as the evening wore on and they started to get busy, but wait staff were always eager to please if somewhat tardy. I'm tucking Yantra in my entertaining and casual business dining pocket
5
Great service, and fantastic food. My waiter even offered to have the chef make half portions so I could try a meat and vegetable dish (I was dining alone). I will happily return.
5
Turned out to be a great lunch ... They were having a food promo with Creme Centre... Well the food was better than the original marine drive restaurant
5
It's beautiful fine dine restaurant. Quite a range for starters and main course. The starters were great. We got so full just by having the starters that there was no space for the main course. They also have a good range of vegetarian food on the pallet. Chaat items were excellent. Both myself & hubby just have praises for this restaurant. Kudos Yantra
5
Beautiful restaraunt and a menu to match! Fantastic range of food, quite different to our normal Indian if you are used to dining in UK. I was in Delhi four times last year and Tantra 'knocks spots' off any Indian restaraunt I went to there. The only killer is the wine list-very expensive but hey, that goes for most decent food outlets in Singapore. The food was presented very well by waiters Anti and Mike, thank you:-) Their attention was attentative without being intrusive and their knowledge of the dishes on offer was second to none. I guess you could order anything on the menu and you would not be let down as the choices are very interesting
5
Chef Chintan Pandya and his team create a perfect evening with excellent cuisine and splendid ambiance at this super restaurant. Right from the first order to dessert, this is an excellent journey, which takes you through the culinary delights of Northern India. The palette is mouth watering and the open kitchen concept (albeit behind a glass panel) makes it a super experience. To top this up, the wine list is extensive and the cocktails at the bar are as good as what you will find at any top class bar or pub in Singapore.We have had parties, family gatherings and business dinners here and every occasion has been excellent and Chef Pandya and his team have always come up trumps

I would not come here again as the prices are out of my upper range. But I did visit with friends and their family. Loved the picture based menu. I was excited about the food by just the menu. And food looked somewhat close to what was shown in menu. STARTERS: were great and will always be great. Tandoor items were tasty. Veg options were modern creative. Shush kebab was average though. Was missing some items in mince mix to get it out of boring. Just having starters and sharing is enough for the visit. Mains were very creative and we spent lots of time trying to analyse the clever flavours. Some were smokey. Others had unique spices. It's not your normal Indian resturant. So it's worth a visit to enjoy or impress others. At next chance I'll go back. For the other starters. Cocktails or concoction drinks were for the brave. Be careful and be brave. Again creative and unique with the drinks also. This also sets them way apart and they can then demand the upper prices. SERVICE: was excellent. Prakash was pleasant and served us well. Didn't say too much but talked when spoken to. Felt like he was our personal server. Attended to all our needs. At the end of the night he had to leave as it was past closing time and his colleagues took over. We did not even know it was late and we did not have any pressure to leave. We rushed cos we didn't want to keep others waiting past their home time. Since it was my friend birthday so we ordered he smoking kulfi ice cream and sang happy birthday for her. And to our surprise a bit later, even in an empty resturant the new waiter brought us a block of tasty chocolate cake with a candle. What a pleasant surprise. Rounded the evening with a lovely highlight of the day. Try out Yantra and have your own experiences. By the, I think the kulfi ice cream is sugar free or used natural flavours.

I've been to this restaurant many times and the service has been horrible every time. I question myself as to why I continue to go back, but it the location is good and the restaurant does have a nice atmosphere. I most recently went in for lunch alone and waited at the front counter for a long time, before I had to get someone's attention, yep I had to ask for someone to help me. When I asked to be seated, this waiter then went and got someone else to help me whom them asked if I had a reservation... mind you there were only about 10 people in the restaurant!!! I proceeded to sit down, was actually served water very quickly. I waited, and waited, and waited.... nothing. I got up and walked out since no one came up to my table after I was served water. As I walked out someone came up to me and asked (well not really)... basically got my attention to turn around. I simply said no one waited on me. He along with a chef who had walked up at this point said to me "it's buffet." Well, as I said that I have been to this restaurant many times, never for lunch - so how is one suppose to know it's buffet????
4
Went there for dinner - a group of 8. We ordered 3 appetizers, 5 main courses with some bread and dumbriyani. Food was really really good, a little on the spicy side (but I love spicy food). Service, however, was a little too clinical. The restaurant itself is nice and elegant, tucked away in a corner of Tanglin Mall so you do not feel that you are inside a mall. The ambience, however, was not the most pleasant. Overall it felt a little 'cold' and our server, although polite and prompt, failed to connect at a 'human level'. Everything was done almost too promptly that made us feel like this table was booked for another party after us. Kulfi dessert was nicely presented, but tasted quite awful. Without drinks, we spent SGD50 per head. Not cheap. I heard the lunch buffet is really good. SGD 25 per head for 25 dishes. Maybe should try that next time
5
Lovely sanguine environment. Clean and well designed menus allow the novice to feel comfortable ordering unfamiliar dishes with confidence of satisfaction. Please do sample the buttermilk digestif and masala tea-both are stand outs. We ate until our bellies ached - every dish was a delight. Naan is tender, rice dish featured chunks of crunchy carrots and tender peas - rice was served steamed in a lid of tender bread! Certainly not hawker prices but worth every penny! Go, you will be surprised with the quality of service AND food
4
There's a pretty good selection of places for Indian in Singapore. Some of them are cheap & cheerful, while others, like Yantra, are perfect for a more special occasion. I've visited yantra often, usually with overseas guests, and always enjoyed the a la carte offerings. I've never had a bad lamb dish, the breads are delicious & the tandoori chicken is amazingly tender. And wonderfully for Indian food, everything has a distinct and unique flavor that isn't dominated just by chilli. Service is friendly, and soma bar out the back is lovely for a glass or few of bubbly at sunset.The lunch buffet is popular, but i think there are better value set lunch options out there
2
We have been long-time regular customers at Yantra and thought the food was excellent. However recently this all has changed. The food quality and variety has become quite mediocre.
4
Good very traditional Punjabi food. Like all Singapore it is bit on the expensive side but having said that we really enjoyed the restaurant and food. The staff were really good
3
Had an early reservation at 19:00.Only three other covers.Service at this point good although only what you'd expect from a restaurant charging these sort of prices.Ordered the mixed selection of kebabs, chicken, lamb, fish.Lamb was tasteless, chicken tasted as though it was re-constituted, fish was good.Mains ordered - prawn goan curry. This was a disaster....tasteless sauce, tiny overcooked prawns which bore no resemblance to the dish photo in the menu. Also ordered a chicken curry dish which was ok.Pilau rice with coriander ok.Told the waiter about the prawn dish. Well trained as he offered to bring us something else which we declined. Chef came over and said the prawn dish was one of the most popular !!After mains cleared the service disappeared completely. No menu for desserts,coffee etc.The mains average sgd 30-40 eachThey didn't charge us for the prawn dish.Basically a restaurant that is form over substance charging exorbitant prices for very average food
3
We went to Yantra on recommendation from the Hotel we were staying in. Although we did not book and the place was virtually empty, we were asked to wait - and an Indian couple walked in and also did not have a booking but were immediately seated! We were really looking forward to some traditional Indian but were dissapointed as the menu contained modern interpretations of Indian food. It was very tasty and fresh (the broccoli covered in yoghurt and cooked in the tandoor was to die for). We noticed a different table had a differnt menu - did we get the 'whitey' tourist menu? There was very llittle chilli to be had - if any. The service was 'OK'. We felt completly forgotten at times. The atmosphere was nice though. You pay top dollar but don't expect anything authentic. Other reviews seem to say it is authentic, which makes me even more certain that we got a special tourist menu
5
By far the best indian restaurant in singapore. They prepare their kababs and naans fresh which are fantastic. Ambience is really good and service staff very helpful. I only wish that the place was more conveniently located, perhaps closer to the cbd rather than in tanglin mall
4
Albeit a bit pricy for Indian food, it definitely would not put me off coming back. The service was great (unusual for Singapore), the quality of the food was spectacular. The problem is there are so many Indian restaurants in Singapore that are a 1/10th the price, so it is hard to justify on a regular basis
3
Each time I have been here, the restaurant has provided a poor initial impression. The 'welcome' is far from friendly, and on the last occasion they claimed not to have my reservation. They let me have a table, but only grudgingly, and without apology. The food is pretty average, and will disappoint those who have heard this described as one of Singapore's best Indian restaurants
4
I have been to the restaurant SEVERAL times... being an Indian, I crave a good North Indian meal very often, and Yantra is a favorite amongst me and my friends. The ambiance is quite nice... the service can sometimes be slow but always friendly and well meaning. I would highly recommend the Galawati Kebab (flavorful and melt in your mouth), Murgh Makhni, Bhuna Gosht, Dal Yantra and Jalebis for (dessert) The Yantra platter (starter) is worth trying if you have a group of 4 or more
3
Been there early this week for lunch buffet as the English guy whom we farewell is crazy about India food. Really not much selections, - 2 soup, 3 types of rice (Chicken Briyani, Veggie Briyani and white rice), fish, chickens and veggies, mixed-fruits and 2 desserts. We've completely samples all food in just 2 rounds. Food taste is mild, definitely nobody will hate it, but it does not leave much impression too. Service wise, the usual S'pore std - a mixed of good experienced staff and inexperienced ones. In short, there is really no factors that pull me back to this restaurant. Perhaps the restaurant shall really revamp the buffet concept
4
We went for my birthday dinner. Ambiance is great. But you can not make reservations there as their phone never is in order and they don't care either.Anyways. The Food was very delicious and servings very very large. We very almost full in starters only. The slow cooked black lentil was really amazing! The food service was a little lazy but staff was friendly and polite. The open view of tandoor thrills you as you can actually see how the person can handle red hot stick in hands. I found prices quite high. Over all I likes the place and would like to visit again
5
Lovely ambience; extremely polite staff; great food and reasonable price. Only drawback is that it is a bit tough to find the place.
2
Lovely ambiance but when starter arrived it was cold and undercooked, it was replaced but still not cooked properly. Our other orders were good and staff were keen to please but not sure if I would return as the prices charged seemed excessive.
4
My husband and I went to Yantra for our Anniversary dinner and it was a good experience. Food was delightful - The only downside was the slow service.
5
This is the best Indian food I've had outside of India. Most people think Indian food is mouth numbing hot.... good Indian food is is not overwhelmed with spiciness but remains flavorful to the palate. The food at Yantra fits this latter description.Yantra is located in an older shopping mall adjacent to the Traders Hotel
2
I've been coming here for the lunch buffet ($18) for about a year now with friends, always bringing along my daughter. The food is good, especially on weekends (and more expensive at $25). Our last visit ended up very unpleasant though. Won't be coming back. They charged my 4-year old daughter the same as a grown-up, telling us she'd be charged because she "definately consumed food." All she had was a few pieces of naan and bits of fruit!!! We complained as they didn't charge kids before, but they refused to listen. If you're eating with kids, just totally avoid this place, even if the food is good
1
Yantra (Indian restaurant) in Tanglin Mall, Singapore was a huge disappointment. The d√©cor and the menu lull you into a false sense that the total dining experience is going to be one to remember ‚Äì this however was not to be the case. The service was shoddy and the starter (Murgh Kalimirch) consisting of six chicken morsels (at $ 30.- excl tax and service) was raw inside. Raw chicken is a big No!When asked to re-do the dish there was no given apology and I was left with the feeling that the waiters were unhappy that I had sent the food back to be redone ‚Äì and Re-done it was ‚Ä¶ only this time my wife and I received four morsels rather than six on the same dish ‚Äì now I am no expert but I would say the food had been micro waved and it was now piping hot raw in the middle chicken.Time to leave ‚Ä¶ Having said that the food, atmosphere and experience had now become unpleasant and that I sought my bill for the food up to that point I was berated by both the waiter and the manager into giving them another chance to correct the dish not once but a total of eleven times before they finally conceded to my request. I most certainly do not recommend this restaurant ‚Äì there are so many other good ones which are far more reasonably priced in Singapore where the staff and kitchen make a real effort
5
We love to eat out and try different Indian food in the US and being in Singapore the pictures of the restaurant really caught my attention. Well it doesn't stop there - the food and service are amazing. We even met the manager who was very kind. We ordered so much food we have enough left overs for another night. The food melted in my mouth and the portions were great. It was a great mix of Adults out and families. It is a classy Indian restaurant and worth every penny. Go you will LOVE it! I can;t wait to go back
4
Had a good Indian meal here with friends. The restaurant has a great ambience and complemented by good food. The service was slightly slow but I think it was due to a private event happening at the bar area of the restaurant. They have some credit card promotions, so do check before paying the bill to get your due discount. The kebab platter was great, fresh meats and cooked to perfection. Try it
5
We had a couple of dinners here during our recent visit and loved the food. Service during the first visit was not so good, but during the second visit they redeemed themselves. Just loved their starters - in particular their chaat platter, its a must have. In dessert, go for the fresh Jalebi - its mouth watering
4
The ambience is the big selling poont of this place. It is very pretty and flashy. There are several dishes that I like, because they make them less spicy. Tandoori Chicken is very nice. They also have a cheese curry that they make vey mild. The prices are on the higher side though. The most fantastic dish for me on the menu is the mango rasmalai. THis might be the best desert I ever had in Singapore. Again, not cheap for Singapore standards though.If you are not going for a la carte you can get some great buffett offers at lunch time. That is really good value for money. But if you want certain dishes from a la carte menue, they might not be included. They also have great high tea offers (can't comment on food though, as I haven't been there yet) All in all, a very good place, that people should try.There is also a bar next door
1
Insists on a formal dress code!
5
Taken by indian friends who regularly visit. Freshly prepared in tndoor ovens, well presented, great flavours and tastes. good service. worth a visit.
4
This resteraunt has a comprehesive menu and the staff are willing to advise.Our meal was lovley but quite large so if I ate here again I would probably order something different. The resteraunt is clean and stylish and you can see the chefs at work as their kitchen is quite open.The only negative was the reteraunt was far too cold. They do have a supply of pashimas to borrow but that was not enough so I felt I could not linger over my meal as I was frozen. However the food was great and the price reasonable
4
When in Singapore and you can not overcome cravings for Indian food... head to Yantra, a fine dining Indian restaurant. Great location, superb staff and awesome food. You would often come across Indian restaurants in major cities in world; but you would rarely come across the one which serves you Indian food which can be compared to the best joints in India itself. e.g. we tried Dahi-wara, and it turned out to be best preparation that you could have. We tried variety of dishes there, and couldnt find any flaw in it. And yes, you go there couple of times; staff kind of recognises you and they are would even recollect whats your favourite
4
For a buffet lunch,Yantra surely deserve a thumb up. If the naans are less burnt,or rather not burnt,and are softer,less chewy,two thumbs up will be given for it for sure. Overall it surely is Value for money base on the quantity &.quality of food that are being served
5
Watching my food being cooked in the vast Tandoors was entertainment itself at Yantra! Though a little pricey the food is first class and reminds me of the Michelin starred restaurant in London...Amaya. The staff were excellent with high attention to detail and great recommendations. The location is away from the bustle of Clark Quay etc. but offers refined dining in a modern and clean restaurant, next to Tanglin mall and the Four Seasons/Trader hotels
5
I travel a great deal and have eaten in many fine Indian restaurants around the world, including in India, London, Hong Kong, Vancouver, etc. Every time I visit Singapore, I make a point of going to Yantra. It has a very cool, modern feel, good low lighting, and a beautiful aesthetic.The vegetarian dishes are excellent and in some cases very innovative, and the fish and chicken dishes spectacular. The staff range from sophisticated to somewhat inexperienced, but whenever I was served by the latter, a more senior person was hovering in the background
2
Yantra quality and services deteriorated from the last few visits, it has now poor service quality, average food quallity but bill is getting expensive, not sure, why but the owners suppose to have a good control of Yantra service and ambience, but during today visit, food quality so so, service bad- soggy bread, order Masala tea but did not arrive in time or worse at all, table not clear fast enough, Yantra team -time to buck up or if not, you do not deserved to get support from customers
5
My husband and I loved this meal! The restaurant is very cool...Has a Miami feeling too it and usually when you go to a restaurant like that the food is not great; however, the food here is very good! The naan bread and all the Indian dishes we got were very memorable. If you like Indian food, do not miss it! The Singapore Sling was also great here
5
Indian food has always been part of Singapore culture and culinary delights. Often people head down to Little India along Race Course Road to try out top quality cuisine emanating from all parts of the sub-continent. However, if you are looking for exquisite Northern India food head along Orchard Road to Tanglin Mall (not Tanglin Shopping Center) to a restaurant called Yantra. Opened since May this year you are in for a treat if you enjoy authentic dishes such as Bhindi Chatpata (spicy baby Okra salad), Murgh Lassoni (melt in your mouth pieces of char-grilled boneless chunks of chicken marinated in yogurt, spices and garam masala) and Aloo Chutneywala ( a delicious potato appertizer). The buffet lunch is well worth the visit. Now the idea of Indian buffet lunches would not normally make me salivate but trust me, this is no ordinary buffet. The main courses include a wonderfully fragrant Jeera Fried Rice, a thick pungent and sweet tasting Tawa Jhinge (stir fried Tiger prawns) and the unique taste of coriander laden Chicken Jalfrezi. If after all of that you can find space for dessert you will be treated to such delights as Gulab Jamun and a creamy Vermicelli Kheer. If all of this wonderful food wasn‚Äôt enough Yantra is in a space and has a vibe that would not be out of place in Manhattan. Long mahogany colored tables are accented with immaculate white china ware and high backed linen covered chairs whilst smaller tables line-up along the walls. Finally the wait staff is knowledgeable, engaging and go out of their way to help. When I managed to get a spot of sauce on my shirt (what can I say‚Ä¶) one of the staff magically appeared with a glass of soda water and a small napkin to aid my feeble attempts at removing the stain!As with many good things in Singapore, Yantra is not inexpensive but go ahead and treat yourself. You won‚Äôt regret it
