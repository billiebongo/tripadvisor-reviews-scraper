Great experience, atmosphere and service. Good entertainment too with noodle throwing waiters and a mandarin character so very different night out.
Food was excellent with a great range and fun cooking for yourselves.

Had dinner here with the local team when in SG recently.
In short, the place is a must.
Great food, great atmosphere and good service.

Food is fresh but abit pricey. Avoid to go there on Friday for dinner, need to wait very long. Overall excellent service and nice seaview.

The service is fantastic and almost every cooking action is done by the waitress. A lot of sauce varieties and the waitress also helped us come up with a potent combination! the choices of soups was also unique. Good selection of food as well. There was also entertainment of cultural Chinese face changing dance! Even the ramen preparation is a show. They even have an outlet to charge your phone. You can wear an apron or have a blanket to cover your bag and a bag for your phone so that it doesn't get dirty

Had ordered quite a variety of food and found them to be really tasty! We had four soup base all in one pot. Chicken, mushroom, tomato and laksa. Had particularly enjoyed the chicken and mushroom base. Light and tasty. The laksa is a surprise as well. Had found the meatball with mushroom very tasty. Food are very fresh. Fruits served are also sweet and fresh. Service is always prompt and delivered with a smile. Order the handmade noodles. For $4/portion, you will be treated to a “performance” of How noodles is made by the staff. Free flow of popcorns and ice cream are also available. This is a place where you are probably happy to pay at. Enjoyable

Visited the place with family members to celebrate birthday. Though the place was crowded but there were drinks and snacks to keep you occupied while the table is ready. Special noodle making and not forgetting the mask-changing performance were indeed fascinating. A place worth 2nd or more visits

Love the service and everything but take note it is very expensive. However, the price and the quality are equal so it is worth it. I did some vlog come and check it out: (enchannel)#14 SINGAPORE PART 2 HAI DI LAU & SALTED EGG PORK CHO

The first few times we tried this restaurant, we were put off by the long waiting time and never queued. But there was one time when the waiting time was acceptable and we finally ate at the restaurant. Since then, it had become our all time favorite. The food was fresh and tasty and the service was good

Great choices of steamboat soup bases, very fresh ingredients and even a performance if you order the noodles. I've never been to a restaurant with such attentive and considerate service. While waiting in queue, have your nails done, eat some popcorn and fruit. When you are seated, the staff brings you aprons, hair ties (for those with long hair), covers for your bag, a ziplock bag and a screen cleaner for your mobile phone. I heard if you've got a baby, there's even a baby cot!! They are well staffed so you get dedicated service. The staff constantly comes to top your drink, clear the plates, clear the scum off the soup.All these come at a price. I've been to HDL about 10 times, and paid about $50 per pax without seafood each time. If you've got room, there's ice-cream at the exit. It's service at its best, and worth paying for

There is a large variety of food items to choose from, as well as soup bases. They are all very fresh and really tasty!But what really stole the show was the service! The service staff are really attentive to you and go out of their way to make the dining experience an awesome one.If it is crowded and you need to wait a while for your booking, they will pamper you with lots of snacks and even a manicure or pedicure!

Food is very good. But waiting time is far too long. We waited 2.5 hours. Think time management for this place is very bad.
Food is also quite expensive. Drinks and chilly is extra charge.

We ate here not between lunch and dinner time so the restaurant were not too crowded. They have a great service, they gave us apron to wear, toys for the kids and plastic bag for the mobile phone so it save from the vapors. We ordered chicken broth, mushroom, mala and seafood broth. Love all of them but the mala were too spicy and oily.The meat, and vegetables were so fresh. I recommend everyone to try this place.And if you on the waiting line, they give you free manicure and ice cream also for free.

Have long heard about their queue over this hotpot restaurant. Finally manage to book a table for early lunch on a sunday morning. Could not believe this place is so popular and people already in the queue by 11am. We were given a table with 4 seater although there's only 2 of us. When seated we were given fresh warm towels to freshen up. Then came the ipad for ordering. Followed by a zip lock bag for your mobile phone and a small wet tissue for your mobile phone. And were told to zip lock our phone up incase it may get dirty while dining. We chose the tomato and chicken soup base based on friends recommendation. And we are very pleased with the 2 soup base. Especially the tomato soup base which is very light and appetizing. Thumbs up ! This is the best soup base compared to some others which I had tried.The service is excellent, we were served by Sarah who was taking care of our section seated. A very pleasant lady who is always smiling and topping up our drinks too. She volunteer to made the sauce since is our first time there. After our lunch, she told us to help ourselves with the dessert in the fridge near the sauce table and the ice cream near the entrance. There was no rush from any staff to make us leave asap though there was a long queue of at least 30 people waiting. This is the what we like best, no hurry to chase us off even though we had already finished up our meal.I will highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for good service with good food. I will be back soon with all my family and friends.Hai Di Lao is the best so far in my choice of hotpot restaurant

If you haven't experience the 'Hai Dee Lao' difference, then you're missing out. This franchised restaurant offers a unique dinning experience right from the moment you walk in. Usually subject to a wait, patient patrons are showered with complimentary nibbles and drinks until their table is ready (women can elect to have a manicure while they wait!). The Hot-pot base(s) are simply beautiful and rich in flavor and the selection of meats, veges and other items are also of similar caliber. Make sure you get the 'Noodle Dance' option - loads of fun. Originally from China and now throughout Asia I would highly recommended trying this restaurant

Hai Di Lao rocks! This place is amazing. The wait is long but worth it! We had a 4 soup combo of mushroom, laksa, chicken and tomato. Then we just kept adding meats, veggies, dumplings and noodles. The buffet has amazing DYI sauce facilities and salads and fruits.Eat here for an experience!

Yes, there's many places where one can get good steamboat but not many can give the same feel-good experience like Hai Di Lao.What really stands out from the rest is the service. From the time you call in or get your queue number until the time you pay. You are made to genuinely feel they are extremely grateful for your patronage. Every time, all the time. You are served unlimited drinks, snacks, fruits and to my kid's delights, ice cream and popcorn while you wait. Occasionally porridge too. Mind you, it's a NOT a buffet eatery, apart from the condiments and a few desserts at $4/head.My group of diners, whether family or friends are not big on meat or seafood. This place caters to all. There are 2 non-meat soup stock - the superb tomato and the mushroom. Just ask the friendly waiters. They will be able to suggest vegetarian-friendly stock. Even the mah lak (spicy soup) can be made using no-meat base.The only drawback with Vivo branch is the smaller waiting area. You might end up having to wait outdoors. Not that it is any worst apart from being non-air-conditioned. The wait can be as long as 5 hours on weekends during peak periods. Get a number, then go shop or catch a movie. Our wait was 2.5 hrs when we got there at 7.30pm on a weekday. The wait is shortest before 5pm and between 10pm-12am. The Orchard and Clark Quay branches get busier after 12am

Visited HDL on many occasions, over a couple of months with my family, friends and loved one. Superb service by their staff as always. Long queues are usually the case, unless you go during the non-peak period, or if you are recognised as a frequent diner, of which you will get to enter quickly. Entertaining noodles performance by your table, snack and sauce counters around the large restaurant, opens till late (5am?6am?) so perfect for supper

We have our New Year Eve's dinner and Chinese New Year Reunion dinner at Hai Di Lao in VivoCity at Harbourfront. We enjoyed ourselves very much. There are many varieties of food and excellent choice of condiments in this restaurant.The restaurant is big and the seats are spacious. For those who have their seats near the windows, the views are excellent and great, overlooking at Resorts World Sentosa.The restaurant is always very neat and very tidy

Went to the one in Beijing, and then in Singapore. The quality is the same and the staff is so helpful and attentive! The food is quick to arrive and the broths are tasty! Nothing to dislike about this place. Even the herbal tea comes in jugs!! Don't forget to 'Lao mein'. The chef will come out and dance while pulling the noodles. It is so good!
