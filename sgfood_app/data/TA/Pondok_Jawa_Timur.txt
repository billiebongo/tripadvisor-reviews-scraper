We had many small dishes and their reputation of having the best oxtail soup is definitely proven. Very very tasty soup, with soft meat that falls off the bone.
The other dishes were yummy too, just not the best.

I totally enjoyed all the dishes on the mini-sampler and should have gone for ordering some of the dishes separately as well as some others. This is a small place but the staff are friendly and helpful.

Food was freshly cooked and very tasty ,however,if you want great views and restaurant ambience then this is not for you. There were six of us and we had a mixture of starters and mains all served at the same time ! Be aware that NO alcohol is served at this venue but the soft drinks were cheap.Overall worth finding for good food and great value but not the surroundings

Took the MRT to this section of the city specifically looking for another restaurant that we had heard of, but came across this place as we were walking through the district. My interest was piqued by the fact that I had never been to a strictly Javanese restaurant before. We were certainly not disappointed. The beef Rendang Jawa Timur was luxurious and rich, so full of flavour! I wanted to keep eating forever... We also sampled the nasi kuning, and the nasi hijau, turmeric and pandan infused rices, and supplemented our meal with an order of chicken satay in a special peanut sauce. The owners were very friendly and helpful when explaining menu items, and seemed genuinely pleased that we were smitten by the food. And in keeping with the largely Muslim population in this neighbourhood, the menu is halal. Certainly worth a visit if you're in the area and want a treat for your palate

We stopped in for a light meal - satay chicken and beef rendang - and I'm so glad we did.The place is very unassuming, but the service was quick, friendly and precessional. Our food came out quickly and it was delicious.The meal was very tasty and affordable. Would definitely come back here again

Upon entering, nice hanging lights deco with some indon artwork on the side wall. Order their signature Fish head curry, ayamt penyet and rendang Beef... suprisiing all very tasty and service staffs were very attentive and friendly. we were reminded by the staff to try Ice Cendol and Ice Teler.............. both dessert were so YUMMY!!!Overall the Price is ok for authentic indo food experience ....and will be back soon

My family of 3 had dinner here on 16th October between 6.00-6.40pm. We ordered Ayam Penyet, Cumi Belado, Kangkung Belacan, Kacang Ikan Teri, 2 Nasi Putih and 1 Nasi Kuning. We found the portions small and the quality of the dishes quite mediocre. The service was tardy considering that there was only 1 other table (consisting of 2 diners) that was occupied during most of the duration of our meal. When our orders arrived about 10-15 minutes later, all the dishes except the Kacang Ikan Teri arrived. I only realised that the kitchen had forgotten the Kacang Ikan Teri when we were almost two-third's of the way through our meal. I had to remind our server that we hadn't received the Kacang Ikan Teri. In addition, the male server who waited on us was extremely unprofessional. We saw him repeatedly joking, bantering and playing the fool with the female server, in full view of the restaurant patrons. We were extremely disappointed with the dinner we had here. I was hoping to have an enjoyable Indonesian meal with my family here but I wish we had just gone to a nearby food court where the ambience would have been better and the food cheaper and tastier, and where I wouldn't have to pay for sub-standard service

I had the nasi ayam penyet and the waitress was surprised that I asked for rice. I thought that Nasi Ayam penyet comes with rice. The rice was just a bowl of plain rice and not the chicken rice that you get in most places. The bergedel was good though.I also had the chendol and it had a taste I can't really tell. I paid $15.30 for a plate of nasi ayam penyet and a glass of chendol. Not worth the money

If you happen to visit Kampong Glam, don't miss the Pondok Jawa Timur restaurant , food is tasty, personally i think it's authentic Javanese. Service very good. Try the Cendol :)

It is a good indonesian restaurant. The food taste is original. The price is affordable for Singapore standard price. The service is also good.

Has simple look but excellent taste! Food prepared reasonable timing since there was not many customer at that point of time. Food was superb and portion is reasonable. There are ala carte and sets to choose from.

We stumbled across this restaurant on a stormy night on way back to Hotel and what a pleasant oasis in the maelstrom. Classic Indonesian dishes abound. The servings were generous and the prices realistic. Authentic food at it's best. The owner served us in an efficient and friendly manner. The drinks were cool and refreshing. Highly recommend this restaurant for lovers of Indonesian food and looking for something different

Tucked away down the end of north bridge rd just off Beech road, Is this authentic Indonesian restaurant sparsely decorated and serving no alcohol (probably for religious reasons ) but the food made up for this it was excellent ! The staff was welcoming helpful and courteous . And I will be returning

We've tasted better. The rawon soup (beef black soup) were bland and watery. The beef in the soup tasted that like it was not thawed fully before it was cooked. The tilapia fried fish was over-fried and oily. We make better omelette at home. The mix vegetable was the only one normal. Tahu telor was also so-so. We had no choice as they were the only two opened at 9pm on the night before the Hari Raya Aidil Adha public holiday (2015). The other place opened nearly was super crowded

By pure coincidence we chanced upon this eatery and the first time we just bought a take-away to test the place and taste. Having passed it with flying colors we decided to return for a sit-in meal. As the place is rather small you either have to come early or do make a reservation but it is worth the effort.It started not too good for us as we were first 'forgotten' for the menu as a big group came in and then we were asked to move to a smaller table as there were people who came after us waiting for a table.But either it was an one off-thing or they were making up for the earlier mishaps, the staff after that were very attentive esp. the male server who came by and spoke to us in Indonesian.The food was simply great, real authentic Indonesian fare for a reasonable price esp. if you compare to those Indonesian restaurants in town area. We had the beef rendang which is different from the ones you used to in Singapore, the ayam kare was deliciously yummy and the tahu telor and gado2 had a real good Jawa Timur taste.We will definitely be back to savor the other dishes, for sure worth a recommendation

Maybe its because I came just 1 hour before closing time, the food we had were quite disappointing. Maybe the cook or chef were getting ready to pack up. People wanting to come in at 9.25pm were turned away at the door; they were told that it was almost closing time. To think that closing time was 10pm. We actually didn't finish the food we ordered but ended up ordering a packet of Fried Noodles from another eating place on our way back to our hotel. Maybe, if we had come not too close to closing time, the food would have been better. That's a big maybe though
