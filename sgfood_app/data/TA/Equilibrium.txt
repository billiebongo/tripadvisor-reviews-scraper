Really good italian food. The set dinner is value for money. The aglio olio pasta with wine is delicious! The price of the drinks are pretty reasonable.
3
Went for set lunch. Price was affordable but portion was little. Wide selection of mains. Beef hamburger patty was OK, mushroom chicken pizza was too dry.
2
Came here after the National Gallery. Had the set lunch with pizza. The non- entree elements of the sat lunch were better than the entree. Service was crazy slow and restaurant was not even close to full.
4
All of us (group of 4) had the good valued set lunch which is only available during weekdays. Service is good by the friendly staff. Will go back again to try other food items

This is a lovely setting with a old world feel. It’s in a charming black and white bungalow and the lighting is warm and intimate. The communion platter for 2 is very innovative and delightful. Highly recommended dining experience for a romantic date.
5
Love the place for its great ambience. Good place to visit on a PH as not too crowded. Food and service was great too!
5
I had a birthday celebration for my girlfriend here on a Saturday night (10th Feb 2018). Perhaps because of its location, it was not crowded on weekends. The interior of the restaurant was done nicely, and I had a wonderful dinner. The attentive waitress even assisted me with my birthday celebration by helping me surprise my girlfriend. The Carte Blanche dinner was fun to have and affordable, and the chocolate cake was huge and flavorful.

I love Supply and Demand. Surprised to find out there was Equilibrium by Supply and Demand near my office. You have lots of food choices for the set lunch. You can choose from SGD15.90 or SGD17.90 set which comes with an appetizer and a main course. Also, a nice place to have an enjoyable business lunch.
4
Equilibrium has a nice vibe. I like how they give every table water served in a wine bottle. The service is friendly and efficient, and the set lunches are lovely. Try the pan seared seabass. Very well executed, although can tone down on the salt level!
4
Nice restaurant with good vibes! The place was packed on a Friday evening, with people hanging out at the bar counter outside. Food-wise, spoilt for choices (with a variety of Asian-inspired cuisine as well). Although the carbonara was too bland for my taste, the hot bites and pizza were delicious (almost every table ordered a pizza, thatâ€™s how good it is).Service was quick, even with the crowd. Appreciate that the server refilled our water without us having to ask
4
Good and attentive service. But food portion is a bit small, and the spaghetti carbonara I ordered was so so.
5
Love their value for money lunch sets ranging from $15.90 to $17.90! The restaurant is nicely furnished and located in the new Capitol Piazza. Great place for girls to catch up with one another!
3
However they forgot my order for th lamb chops, waited for 45mins before asking th waiters about it.
4
enjoyed the food, from truffle fries, pasta, pizza, sausages, all are tasty... like the ambient... continued with drink and chit-chats till late :)
5
absolutely lovely place with great food, great service and nice ambience. had the pizza and it was perfecto
5
Ambience was awesome.
Might need a little more thought on the chicken breast meat as it was a little too tough. Pasta was awesome!
4
Went for the dinner on last weekend and ordered the set dinner for the price of $27.90++ which is quite worth it...it come with a main and appetiser...Overall, the food, the ambience, the service just in nice way.
4
nice cozy ambience with friendly helpful staff; we ordered pizza rustico. Shrimp spaghetti aglio olio and risotto with chicken and mushroom; they come with a starter of bread, cheese and salad; the food is tasty and the portion is just nice; at around $25 per person
3
Good ambienceNice food (salad and fried sweet potato) but terrible duck.It was so hard to cut and blood was visible.I and my friend asked the staffs twice regarding the duck whether it was properly cooked. What they said was it was properly cooked and the way they cook might leave blood visible to the leg bone joint area. Oh well, I wasn't able to complain properly as I don't eat duck confit often. But it was so obvious that there is something wrong with the cooking I guess?
4
This outlet is nestled between a row of food and bars. The atmosphere along the corridor is lively , for us , we took the seats inside. Very cosy, little less noisy. The design of the place was done up well and the menu was rather extensive. we ordered the parma harm 21 inch pizza , steak , scallops. All were good. The scallops were impressive. loved the garlic sauce they were cooked in
4
Good with awesome food, but drinks were underwhelming. Still very friendly staff, will recommend....
5
Ordered the tomato cream vodka pasta and steak and it was great! Will definitely be back again for more!
4
Though the environment was excellent, food was good, the particular waiter whom served our table got on our nerves for trying to clear food while we were still eating.
3
I would recommend heading here for a casual work set lunch. Their sets are $13.90++/$16.90++. The ambience is good. Pizzas and pastas are decent. However they are quite slow and disorganised with the service of the food.
2
Went there for lunch .Waiting time for food is too long(more than30 minutes).Beside, the duck confit is tasteless!
4
This place has set meals left to the chef to surprise you that are reasonably priced. The food is quite alright but their Cocktails are good and the Mocktails are refreshing. Love the ambience.
2
Ordered the lunch sets (Arrabiata Clam, Risotto Chicken & Mushroom), and found the taste wanting. Furthermore, service is slow and clumsy.
5
Went for lunch and order the set meal. Came with a good variety for appetizers and main course of pizza and risotto were delicious too.
3
We had the set lunch. It was very reasonably priced. My wife enjoyed the fish dish but my pasta chicken dish was so so. So depend on what you order, you may or may not find the food outstanding. Maybe the food from the ala carte menu might be better.
1
Had reserved a table for 6pm for two. Arrived ontime ay 6:00pm sharp, restaurant had taken in a corporate event at the same time and the table we were allocated was in the middle of a group of 40 people standing at the table. There wasn't even enough room to pull the chairs out from the table, let alone sit down. When explained this to the waiter, his response was "Umm, sorry, big group took over" Which would have been fine if the restaurant had not overbooked. Poor form. Was forced to eat elsewhere
4
Lovely experience..My friends and I ordered the executive lunch set. Definitely value for money. Service was professional and quick despite a full house on the day we've visited. Will definitely return again.
2
By poor service I mean it took 45 minutes for our cocktails to arrive. The waiter had no idea which beer they served in a pint. He also had no idea what sides accompanied the main dishes. I wonder why they charge 10% service charge??
4
Went there for birthday celebration. Ambience is good for gathering and food is good. The service is good.
4
I first came for lunch with friends some months ago. I liked it enough to return with family, then again with other friends. The food is consistently good and the service, while not impeccable, is on the whole friendly.
4
Perfect for a business lunch meeting. Very conducive environment. Love their appetizer consist of ripe brie, salami, a portion of greens, warm bread served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We tried the mushroom risotto, sausage risotto, and a carbonara.The service was quite slow.
4
One of my go-to places for casual and economical busines lunches. Lunch sets are of great value; nice atmosphere. But service can get a bit slow.
4
Overall the ambience at the restaurant is good, excellent food and the portion and service wise great.
4
Had the set lunch mushroom risotto. Quite impressive. Good ambience and good service too even though the restaurant was quite crowded. Will definitely go back.
5
We went on a weekday afternoon for the set lunch and I must say it's value for money! Service staff were attentive though busy mostly and quality of food was excellent! Will be back!

Two courses for $13.90 or $16.90 is a good deal for lunch in this Italian cafe located in the upscale Capitol Plaza. The starter course comprises 2 mini salads, cheese and bread. For my main course I got the pizza with mushrooms and egg - it had a reasonably good crust and plenty of cheese. The pasta and risotto ordered by my lunch mates were good sized portions. The food isn't going to wow you but is competently prepared
4
Called to check on my reservation. However I was in a 3 hr meeting and could not pick up the call. After the meeting I called back to confirm. They kept my reservation for me.
4
Ambience was great. Love the ID, lunch set and service. Been there twice so far. Highly recommended.
Would be perfect if they can throw in coffee/tea for the lunch set. The 2 course set meal feels incomplete without a drink.
4
A fairly good value set lunch. Equilibrium is one of the regular places I visit, in large part because it's near my workplace. Food is generally good for the price, but service is often harried.
4
Nice atmosphere with the ‘semi-outdoor’ condition with sunshine. Set lunch comes with variety of choices. Service was good too.
4
The food was really nice, but the service was inconsistent, as some of the tables were served promptly while others seemed to be often ignored (on accident?) Venue is not child-friendly, as the walkway between tables is rather narrow. Recommended for couples/ friends instead!
4
No doubt went back 3 times within 2 months due to the Chope vouchers purchased but still more drawn due to its food and ambience. However service wise need to be more polished.
4
This is my second time dining in this restaurant and must say, the experience is still good. Quality of ingredients and taste was up to expectations. I don't normally order fusion dishes but this time decided to try the Thai Curry Seafood Pasta which was surprisingly good to me. Maybe the only thing i feel working against them is that the overall pricing is a bit high in my opinion.
4
Overall, the restaurant is very cosy and I would be happy to get any seat. The service staff was very attentive and was very prompt to reach out to us. The food was not as good as expected for the price it is charging. We ordered pasta and risotto.i think the restaurant deserve to be tried out at least once
5
This is a surprise find in Capitol Piazza. Food is great, presentation is creative and attractive, prices are very affordable. Super value especially for the set lunch menu. The in-house beer, Peroni, is very nice.Meat dishes and pastas are simply delicious. So are the desserts - just make sure you are hungry enough as the dessert portions are huge - I recommend sharing!Give this restaurant a try, you will be back again for sure
3
I have visited this restaurant multiple times for lunch and dinner, they were generally good but a recent visit during Lunar New Year period was very disappointing, not sure if the head chef is away, for whatever reason, they are ruining their brand and I am not sure if I should visit them again?
3
Very standard fare and average food I have to say. Wasn't bad but not somewhere I'd think of coming back to given the many options around the area
5
Love the decor n attentive staff. However, the truffle fries was overpriced and didn't taste of truffle at all. Carbonara was way too bitter for kids' liking, adults neither. Pizza was delicious and so was the chicken breast. Nice presentation too.
4
Good classic Italian food in a great atmosphere. Staff was very attentive and helpful. Caesar salad was unique but delicious!
4
I love the décor of this restaurant, cozy and not noisy during weekday lunch hour.
Good value for set lunch. They served bread with olive oil and vinegar. Spaghetti and Grilled Sea Bass was good. Will be back again :)
5
We visited just ahead of a show and the waitress understood we were in a rush, recommended the "fast" dishes and we have a yummy and good value supper to keep our tummies happy through the show. Thank you, we will be back!
5
Went for cocktails, received very good service and good value. Dinner menu looked very good but we were booked for dinner at another place so didn't have the opportunity to try the food. Will denfitely return though

I've been to Equilibrium a couple of times before so I was eager to return to celebrate my birthday this past weekend. Unfortunately, the terrible experience I had with a member of staff means I will unlikely ever return again.We arrived at the restaurant early on a Sunday at 11.35 am. The sign mentioned that the kitchen opened at 12. However, on the very same sign it stated that lunch was from 11.30. Naturally this was a little confusing so I asked the man who seemed to be setting up the tables for some clarification. When I asked if they were open already for lunch he practically waived me away and pointed to the sign saying that the kitchen opened at 12. I politely pointed out that the sign also said that lunch was from 11.30. He looked very impatient with me and angrily pointed out again that the sign said kitchen opens at 12, implying that I didn't know how to read the sign! Once again I highlighted the conflicting information and my intention was to at least get him to acknowledge the sign could cause confusion. All he did was to abruptly blast "I'll Change the Sign!"There was no apology or slightly friendly tone and it was all too clear that he wasn't interested in my business at all. All he had to do was to say nicely that I should come back in 30 mins. However, why should I give business to people who really don't want it. This restaurant really was ok previously (food and other members of staff). However, having just one bad experience with one disastrous member of the team gives a VERY bad impression of the entire team
5
Great value for money set lunch - around Sp$17 per head. Wide choice of main dishes. Delicious appetizer of ripe brie, small green salad and delicious salami, warm bread. olive oil and balsamic vinegar dip followed by the main - I chose the sapghetti and my guest, roast chicken leg. We loved the wildberry ice cream (additional price) and latte
5
Lunch on Sunday. The two set lunch menus were available and they represent incredible value for money. The appetiser set is very cute - bread and oil, salad, cheese and a Tuna and pot 'pate'. The risotto was very well cooked and a good size portion - I had the pork sausage and rucola and it was delicious. Cocktails are fun and at 2 for 1 very good price for Singapore - approx $24 for two. Staff are very sweet and any inexperience is more than made up for with great attitude. Thanks for a lovely lunch - we will definitely be back.
5
I was in love with the decor & their COZZE ALLâ€™ACQUA PAZZAMUSSELS IN AQCUA PAZZA, it was super good. their CARBONARA CLASSICO was good too. just that it fills up fast so we have to call & reserve or go earlier.. they have a 1 for 1 before 6.30pm i think
3
Very little crowd
Pricey but worth it
Food was really good. Tea options was fantastic & well presented
Food served and plated like a fine dining restaurant (Y)
Fungi Cream Pasta abit "too gelat" after while.
Too much menu and abit confusing
4
Came here for some beers tonight: only $20 for 4 bottles of Orion! Remarkable value and friendly service. Might come back and try the food some time. Well worth a visit.
3
A modern place where you can get great and creative cocktails; the treat unfortunately comes at a high price. Cocktails start at S$24 and up. I must say the cocktails do taste excellent. I had the smokey water.
3
Nice atmosphere
Let's hope rest is due to being new:
Mixed up wine orders
Appetizer missed dressing
Rather small portions of the main course
Seafood pasta dish was good
5
This is a great italian restaurant and is always busy of an evening. The food is really good and the service is good.
3
Came here last week with some colleagues to try the set lunch. It was pretty good value: just $60 for the 4 of us for a pasta and starter each. But unfortunately we were still hungry at the end. Food was decent, just the serving sizes were small
4
Yes, the oysters that we ordered were very disappointing. First, because they put too much vinaigrette and second, we thought that they were no longer fresh. I think it was the first time that I felt really sad about oysters.:( Thankfully, they scored some cookie points with the main dish and dessert. I ordered chicken cooked with some herbs (sorry, i forgot the name of the dish!) and my husband ordered risotto (I think!) and they were both really nice. The foie gras wasn't that bad either. For dessert, I ordered the rainbow cake which was called Nocciolato and I remember really liking it because it wasn't too sickeningly sweet. But what we liked most of all was their buy one-take one free cocktail. I hit gold with their "Full Pension" cocktail which had hints of mango and other tropical flavours with just a little drop of alcohol. It was really delicious! I could have tons of it if only I wasn't so terrified of drowning in sugar syrup.:) The staff were pretty mindful and accommodating, considering it was almost closing time when we dined (which probably explains the sorry state of the oysters) at Equilibrium. Overall, I would still give the restaurant a thumb-up when it comes to food, service and location
1
Food is great, sequence of food is fine. But always remember the most important thing is the service you render to the guest. Make them feel comfortable and welcome. This bar staff is kind of rude on his approach and it changes my impression from coming again to this restaurant. By the way his name is amos. Try to be more approachable like belle.she's a sweet heart! And learn how to be humble. Thanks for pissing me out

We love the promotions like 1 for 1 cocktails!(The Sencha Apple cocktail is to die for!)We love the pizzas and you can even choose to Create your Own!The pastas were lovely too and the chefs have put in great effort to ensure that the quality of ingredients live up to the price that you are paying for. We were a little disappointed with the service though. For example, we were a party of 3 people, upon ordering, bread was served and only 2 slices came. Which doesn't make any sense, the server needs to be more alert and service orientated. The additional bread only came after asking for it twice, not acceptable. We were there at about 6.30pm and the restaurant was barely busy, the service was however slow and could be improved. This place has great potential and i would definitely revisit again
5
Cosy setting in the renovated Capitol Building. Very friendly service with a genuine smile.Really good choice of dishes, even for lunch. We walked in for lunch (try the 1-4-1 cocktails!) and returned a few days later for the mad cow night (Sun-Mon) to confirm our first impression. The "Crostini al Pegato e Proscuitto" is a must appetizer! Very decent house wine @11. Looking forward to our next visit. Recommended
