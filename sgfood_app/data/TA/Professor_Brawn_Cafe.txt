Every time I come here I will always come here and order Rosti with Spicy Italian Pork Sausage.
Always asked for butter to go with my Rosti and the potatoes they used for Rosti are very sweet and fragrant.

Came here for a drink with friends. But the drinks were a little expensive. The rosti and potato wedges were average. Not coming back.

Professor Brawn is one of the finest place for a cuppa of coffee with a gigantic slice of cake.
Wonderful ambience, friendly staff and certainly fine food with totally affordable price.

The Meal: I had a Italian Spicy Sausage with Rosti (a set meal including pumpkin soup and a drink of lemon cordial). I thought the portion size was satisfying and the food was hot, tasty and served quickly. My dining companion had the chicken in truffle sauce and she enjoyed it thoroughly as well. Our shared dessert of Oreo Cheesecake was also a hit!The Atmosphere: Fairly quiet, pleasant and good for a long chat between friends (which is what we did!)The Service: This cafe is actually a social enterprise offering work for people with special needs, but it doesn't impact the service standard at all. In fact I think the service here was probably friendlier and more prompt than I've had at many other places

And I thought this place deserves a shoutout on my wall!!I accidentally stumbled on this café on one of my walking sprees..Professor Brawn Cafe is a social enterprise that provides affordable good food by an inclusive quality workforce comprising people with different ablities, age and socio-economc backgrounds. Founded by a former Senior VP at ST Telemedia, Mr Roland Tay set up the café back in 2009 that would provide employment and integration opportunities for people with disabilities – what is now popularly known as a social enterprise.When the cafe first started, it has 3 Pathlight School graduates working. Today it has 20 young adults with special needs, working at both outlets in Novena Square and Boat Quay. Some of them have intellectual disability; others have visual or hearing impairment. Each shift sees a 50-50 ratio of special needs and regular staff. The special needs staff are being paid normal wages..Service is excellent....food is superb with huge portion! I had a struggle with my carrot cake (that is full of nuts and raisins in every bite!!)!The next time u crave for Starbucks or Coffee Bean....do try this place instead..u wont be disappointed with their gourmet coffee...plus ur helping in the reintegration of people with disabilities into the workforce!

Whilst having lunch by myself here thought I could pen a line or two.This restaurant is founded by parents for their Special child. They want to make a difference to the Special Needs Community.They have nice basic hot meals. Set lunches comes with a hot soup & a drink. Prices are resonance & these Special kids work harder & try to please us harder than the normal ones. Why don't we contribute back to the community by having our meals here instead.They have quite a good range of food. I used to love their Swiss Cheese Sausages. But decide that is not so healthy. Now onto others like fish & chips, there's special flown in cod fish marinated in black miso and mirin served with asparagus and savoury sweet potato mash. This is at $35.90++. One can have a set at $15.90++.If one is around Novena Sq just drop in on the 2nd floor to enjoy a simple satisfying hot meal

Lunch deals on weekdays cost $16.90++.
I took the squid ink spaghetti but it didn't come in fluidy squid ink. Nevertheless the taste of the pasta was still great. With UOB card payment, any ala carte order comes with a free scoop of ice cream.

Tried here for brunch and coffee.
Coffee is thumbs up.... Mushroom soup is of restaurant standard and the Rosti is still one of my favourites. PB Cafe will be one where I will definitely hang out if I need my dose of caffeine.

Had lunch here which was very pleasant with a good choice. Sausages were excellent with a great choice. It is a social enterprise which is heartening. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Would go again.

We ate here before a few years back. The foods were average at Best. So, we never got back. Lately, I have read about this place story that they supported autistic employees to be part of normal society again. It's kinda warmth at heart. I decided return to the restaurant again. We went for late lunch yesterday. We ordered ;# Vongole Pasta which using angel hair with perfectly cook to firm. The sauce was a bit light.# Bolognese Pasta which also using the same type of pasta vongole. The sauce was also the same way. Both pasta were average at Best. The portion was as same as Pastamania with 2$ more on price. # Mango Sherbet Ice Cream which natural ice cream from New Zealand. The Mango aroma was super refreshing. The sweet and sour taste just perfect. There was a box for donating money to autistic community at the cashier. We have done it. We will continue to support this place again in the future.

My first thought when I first went there is to support them, after all, they're a social enterprise that trains autistic people and provides them jobs in the cafe. I deliberately set lower expectations of service and food quality, and expected higher prices. But I was very pleasantly surprised. The service is great, the food above average, and the prices lower than the many coffee and tea chains. The ambience is great too. It makes me wonder... Why do I keep going to regular cafe chains where the fare is average, the service is average, seats are hard to find, prices are higher, and profits go to paying huge franchise fees? I'm going to change my eating and drinking habits and patronize places like Professor Brawn more.

We like the mushroom soup - they were generous with the mushrooms and the portion was huge, so we were worried about the main course. I think it could do with less sodium though. My friend found the tomato soup too sour (or was it not sour enough, oops). I ordered a cheese chicken sausage with mashed potato, but found the sausage too salty (which is always the case, no?) with skin that was a tad too stiff and rubbery. The sausage was much longer but thinner than expected. My friends were happy with the chicken.The wait staff were responsive and one of them told us the Desserts of Distinction would make us smarter, LOL. We were hopeful and ordered ice cream. She recommended us the macadamia and walnut variants, which I found a bit too sweet, but then I have always found everything to be too sweet. She also suggested that we order a triple scoop, instead of 3 single $coop$. Why didn't we think of that? The waiters are competent and confident, even if some of them have special needs. This serves as a reminder to me that being inclusive can make a world of difference and is well worth the effort.One friend liked the decor. But I found the tables a bit strange - some have two tables wedged together with an elevated platform in between. That does not facilitate face-to-face conversation and food sharing. We went on a Saturday night and it was not crowded, so we had a good conversation without screaming at one another. I like the fact that we are supporting a good cause even as we are doing something decadent like pigging out. This is one joint I have visited again and again, and so far none of my friends has any major quarrel with the food and staff :

We stumbled across this cafe/restaurant for lunch today, while trying hard to find a lunch different than all the standard chains in most Singapore shopping malls. Professor Brawn was certainly the diamond in the rough - a restaurant geared towards helping those with special needs and priced at a reasonable value considering this is Singapore. We both opted for $25 weekend set which began with soup of the day (which was fine), followed by a decent steak (cooked to perfection - even blue!) with a free warm cake and ice cream for desert. We also ordered a side or rosti which was delicious great and came with real sour cream! The service was also excellent (and it was lovely to see the camaraderie through the front and back of house), and we were thoroughly impressed with the whole experience - we'll be back soon (which makes this a 5 star experience in the most unlikely of places)

+ve:-The sausage & rÃ¶sti was great -Price was reasonable-there was imported cream soda -the cookies & cream ice cream was not too sweet-the space was a little small but it felt cozy-ve:-staff was chatting near our table-personally the special lemonade was a little too sour even though sugar syrup was adde

The restaurant serves the usual Western fare - fish and chips, pasta, sausages and rosti, etc. - but the value for a set meal on a weekday is not bad ($20 with GST and service charge) for its location. There are options for coffee, tea, and dessert as well. The restaurant has a second seating area opposite Tomi Sushi, but this is usually closed unless there's a crowd

Came here (to the outlet in Circular Rd) this week after lunch for some coffee and dessert. I ordered a cappuccino whilst my friend had an espresso, and we had 1 icecream and 1 piece of cake. Both the food and the coffee were very good, although the coffee was perhaps a little strong for my taste. Bill came to about $20. Worth a visit
