Scrambled eggs as good as I remember, sausage was surprisingly juicy and cappuccino was smooth. We also had mochas that were delicious! Excellent proportion of coffee and cocoa. SGC is unpretentious and reliable, and we're so sad that Gene's decided to close.

Went to Selfish Gene last Saturday :D the food did not disappoint! Had the waffle breakie and it was yummy <3
5
Came here for brunch with my husband. Nice and tranquil cafe for a morning brunch. We ordered american breakfast and waffle. Really nicely cooked! Loving them!
4
Food portion was just nice. Awesome brunch however a bit pricy. Location wise quite accessible from MRT.

But in the quest for a great brunch place.. not more than average choice. Atmosphere was nice, staff was super friendly, coffee was great.. but food was unfortunately just average.
5
Place was quiet and quite hidden. Food was of a good portion size. Waiters were friendly and welcoming. Overall good place for a simple fuss free brunch.

We have been going to Selfish Gene for many years now. There are many cafes in the vicinity but Gene, the owner, and his staff is what makes this cafe unique. They are always polite and friendly. They are apologetic when the service is slow or we cannot get a table. They go out of their way to help us with our children and high chairs etc. The food is consistently good. Try the Whole Lot or one of the delicious sandwiches. Coffee is great as well. Nice relaxed atmosphere. The cafe is not too packed like Populus or Lokal and has a slightly suburban feel to it.

Have been going to Selfish Gene for years and I will keep coming back. The food is great. The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is relaxed and unpretentious. Gene treats the customers like friends and goes out of his way to make us feel at home there. Love the Waffle Brekkie that comes with a hot crisp waffle with sausage and scrambled eggs. Killer breakfast at a great price. Love it.
5
It isn't my first time at SGC and once again, I thoroughly enjoyed the food. My husband ordered the 'Whole Lot' while I ordered 'Waffle Brekkie'. We shared the sweet potato fries. All were awesome. Love the scrambled eggs! I had an iced chai latte which was to my liking. This place never disappoints

Selfish Gene is a minimalist, clean and friendly cafe. You order at the counter and the order will be served at your table. The menu range was adequate and price was afforfable. I enjoyed my beef sandwich with a crispy foccacia bread with a slight hint of mustard. The banana cake was light with slices of banana lined with caramel and peanut butter, not too much of it so it was not too sweet. Service was prompt and polite. There were magazines and newspapers if you wish to read. A good place to hang out

This is another visit to enjoy their brunch again. Food portion is as satisfying as usual. Will return again.
5
I ordered the gene's toast which i thoroughly enjoyed. The food here were priced really reasonably too. Will be back to try other dishes.
5
There's everything to love about Selfish Gene. Great food. Reasonable prices. Mellow unpretentious vibe. I have been here many times, and will be back again often.
5
We ordered Whole lot and Gene's toast and both were really good! We will visit again in future to try the other dishes.
5
regularly visit to this place for their food and coffee
friendly service, good value, and great food
3
Coffee is decent, environment is great but no much in cake selection and the truffle doesn't worth for the price.
5
happy to visit the cafe again for its nice atmosphere and good service. recommended to all to visit this cafe!

Have been visiting Selfish Gene Cafe since it's early start up. Unlike other cafes which are inconsistent in their food standards and service, Selfish Gene has been consistent and even better with each visit. Selfish Gene definitely live up to it's slogan of serving only food Gene will eat. The cafe can be a tad noisy when it's crowded. Other than this, it's a cafe with food offerings which will leave you coming back for more.

As the title of my review implies, I may be looking at things from a pair of rose tinted glasses. It was my first official date with a girl who just became my girlfriend. If you can accept that fact that I may be biased, I can vouch that the food is great with generous portions. Atmosphere is simple yet chic at the same tim

Ordered eggs benedict (I forgot what's the actual name), waffles brekkie and the banana cake! Banana cake was SO GOOD especially with the peanut butter drizzled on top. Eggs benedict was not bad, although bread was abit hard and waffles were quite soggy but scrambled eggs and sausages were nice! Would visit again someday!
5
I had the banana cake and the cake of the day which was lavender lemon cake. Both were really good, especially the banana cake.
5
Trying for the first time. The young lady service was awesome . She is friendly and I love her smile. The breakfast set was great. Scrambled egg was done properly. The place is good for relaxing on a Saturday morning.
5
👍🏼 will definitely return again for brunch and gatherings! there's even free wifi. and it's kids-friendly. thanks!

Stumbled across this place as we looked for brunch, not far from Outram station. Ambience - great space with high ceilings, light and airy. All sorts here, couples, families and singles. Full at 1pm. Drinks - enjoyed Fresh orange juice, Latte and Chai Latte. Meals - yogurt with berry compote, "The Whole Lot" (TWL) all good. TWL is really big, with plenty on it all cooked well. We spotted it on another table and realised two could share, and we were full. Service - very friendly, reasonably efficient. The Bill - pretty reasonable given the servings. Would go again.

We passed by and saw this cafe that seemed to be a popular place for the locals living in the vicinity.Arriving just when their doors opened on a Sunday morning, we were the first customers to enter the cafe.This place charges nothing for service (no +10% - hurray!) - so you just have to walk up the counter to place your order when you've decided.We had a B&B Waffle ($14), a "Whole Lot" ($20), which consisted of scrambled eggs, one sausage, some bacon, sauteed mushrooms, a hashbrown, two slices of multigrain toast, and some salad on the side.The waffle was pretty nice - fluffy and soft, yet crunchy on the outside. The plating was decent too, with the bananas and the berries that were sprinkled around the waffle. The "whole lot" was really quite a "whole lot" - for $20 I guess the price was still OK for the portion as you probably would be quite filled up after having the whole lot. The toasted multigrain bread was really excellent and had an old-school bread smell to it.For beverages we had a Mocha ($6) and a Long Black ($4). Their coffee is pretty decent as a morning pick-me-up - just right with a balanced robustness vs. acidity.This is a nice place we would return to if we are ever in the vicinity next time looking for a meal

Good brunch spot in Tanjong Pagar. Good ambiance, friendly staff, easy ordering/quick service, pretty good food and coffee. Not sure why bread doesn't come with the smoke salmon and eggs -- I had to pay $2 extra for multigrain toast, which seemed silly. In any case, overall a positive experience for a relaxed Sunday brunch
4
We liked that the ordering was fuss free and the food was served promptly. The food was great, even though the weekend menu might be a little limited. We also liked the ambience within the cafe - relaxed and quite chill, unlike other cafes where there is sometimes too much noise from the crowds.
4
We had an enjoyable experience - Service was good and relatively quick, which is important during the lunch break.We had the beef sandwich and Gene's toast, both of which were tasty. The beef was good but could have used a few more pieces (though they would then have to raise the prices). The toasted brioche went well with ice cream and honey.All in all, it's a nice place to chill out over a meal

We just had lunch there today and enjoyed the experience. Service was friendly and warm, and we especially liked the area under the skylight, which provides tons of light.We had the beef sandwich. It was so tasty that my wife ate up half the sandwich. The meat and the mustard/wasabe aioli went well together. It might have been good to serve some fries with that, though they would probably prefer you order the truffled fries for $12 separately.We also had Gene's toast. The brioche was delightfully toasted and was delicious with the vanilla ice cream and honey. We were not sure if it was a dessert or a savory dish, as there were also fried shallots mixed in with the muesli-like bits. The overall taste was a little strange and could be offputting to those who do not like fried shallots. I liked the dish but found the portions to be small, so much so that I was still a little hungry after lunch.If you make a reservations, there is an automated telephone confirmation the same morning, which was quite neat. They do charge GST, but not sales tax, so do drop a tip into the tip jar near the cashier

Visit on 26 March 2016 12pm, it was almost full house!The cafe serve really good food, Ordered Gene's toast, chicken sandwich and truffles fries for lunch.The toast is very unique, it come with ice cream with fried shallot,Brussels sprout and toast. It look weird but taste actually not bad! The chicken sandwich is really good, the chicken was juicy and tender, I can tell they pan fried the fresh chicken after order.The truffle fries is very generous,there are topped with truffle oil, cheese and olive,two men cannot finish one bowl.The cafe is great but that time have a big family with noisy kid that parents did not control the kids crying and shouting. The staff are very friendly and fast,overall the experience was great

I you are walking around the Duxton Hill area and need some coffee tea or a fast meal, Selfish gene is an unassuming, cool but not over-cool and reliable and good alternative. Breakfast variants, soups, salads, pasta. All tasty and not expensive.

We went there for brunch over the weekend, was fairly busy. The food itself was nice but nothing special.
3
The cake was good, the coffee was pretty bad. burnt. Took a while too. The cafe seemed friendly enough, good decor. Nice staff.
5
Yummy food, great service & ambiance. Love the eggs royale, the best i have ever tasted ! Price is very reasonable too.
5
Cafe was bright and open, food was tasty and came out quickly. I enjoyed the Selfish Gene Cafe. Did not try a drink but they looked good!
4
Cosy and nice ambience. My frd a chai latte and mocha for me. Both was good.
Must try: Gene Toast ! :)
5
My friends who live in Singapore always take me there when I visited them. Great brunch and coffee. Cool decoration. Lovely atmosphere. Friendly staffs. Will definitely be back again!
4
Went there for brunch with friends on a Saturday. The vibe is good. The food selection is standard and the taste is good! Staff service is fabulous. One thing to improve will be the coffee. It's okie but as compared to a lot other brunch places, the coffee here is just very normal. Overall, still a good pick for weekend chillax

Stumbled on this cafe late on a Saturday morning. From the street it's almost impossible to notice, but it was pretty crowded, clearly well known amongst people who live in the area.A nice atmosphere inside, mixed crowd ranging from very young groups of friends, young families to older couples. Food was good quality and the homemade yoghurt in particular was really delicious, a good portion, excellent value.Salmon also good although a shame that they had drizzled with salad dressing, next time I'd ask them for dressing on the side.Banana cake looked good on the next table!
5
Really enjoy my experience at this cafe with my friends.. I was lost and gonna be late so I called up to postpone my reservation and asked for directions.. The staff who assisted me was most helpful and courteous.. The food's simply superb.. Will recommend this cafe to more friends :
4
I've not seen this place listed on many of the great places for breakfast in Singapore, but decided to give it a go because we are staying round the corner. Really glad we did. Both the breakfast and the coffee were lovely.
4
Great place for brunch. Delicious scrambled egg and toast. Must have its cakes too, which are soft and moist.
5
Great panini,nice people and will go back for more ! Try the chock cake and the beef panini,also the coffee are good and the price is right
4
This is my first visit for me and my friend.The menu is simple with most choices having eggs and salmon included.This same menu is available till 4pm during weekends - a plus for people who eat late lunches during the weekends or this helps to spread out the crowd I like that the prices are reasonable. Average of SGD15 per main course. I am not sure if it is due to the materials of the walls but the noise level sounded high. Other than this, it is great place for brunch 
3
I went with a group of friends and the place was not too hard to find. The environment in the cafe was really nice, it was casual, relaxing yet slightly formal. However, as a student, I found the prices slightly high, and the food was not exceptional except for the banana cake. :) Also, the service was really good. This is a place to visit if you like cafes and cakes. ^
4
I went there during weekend for lunch. it was quite packed and noisy as well. my gf ordered the egg royale and I ordered the ham and cheese sandwiches. we were very satisfied with the food! as for dessert, we ordered the banana cake and it was fantastic! worth visiting again

We heard a lot of good reviews for this place so we decided to go and try it out.I thought it was not *that* good. It wasn't bad, though. But for the price that we paid, I expected better.We both went for the biggest - the Breakfast Plate. It did not make a lasting impression. It was in fact pretty ordinary to me. It consist of scrambled eggs, pork sausage, honey baked ham, mushroom, tomato confit, toasted brioche, butter and jam. The best item was the toasted brioche!We couldn't help but compare with the breakfast we had at a London cafe which was cheaper, bigger and tastier.After that, we decided to try the Banana Cake - mini-loaf of banana cake served warm with caramel, banana, crumble and peanut butter sauce. It was nice but it was such a small serving!!

Love patronising Selfish GeneThe ambience is wonderful however I do admit that when it is packed, it can get pretty overwhelming because of all the chatter and the echo it does get to my head.Love the coffee there. Wouldn't say the same for the matcha latte, prefer The Muffinry for that. But still... the coffee is good. Had banana cake with peanut butter sauce drizzled over it on certain occasions. Absolutely loved it. Have yet to try the other food items and desserts.Staff are pretty friendly, still service is nothing to rave about.Pleasant place, will definitely visit again

We found this cafe following a poor experience ten doors up :) and were delighted That we did. The food and coffee are great plus the staff very friendly and welcoming...Will definitely return to #40 Craig Road.Sorry no details of opening hours as those reviews tend to be left by the owners..

Was here a few months ago and I remember the service being better. Maybe because the place was still new. The coffee was ok, cos I really prefer a good espresso with a good crema. What is lacking in the coffee is the intensity and depth, problems with coffees you get in Singapore. Luckily, it wasn't one of those over acidic coffees that seem to be sprouting out everywhere in Singapore. My lunch companion ordered a latte and found it ok too, so I guess that means average....The food is good. If you like sandwiches, they do make a good beef sandwich. I especially like the crusty bread they use. But the menu is limited. Both times, i ordered the roast beef sandwich because there wan't anything else I like in the menu. But I must stress, that it was a good roast beef sandwich.However, as an overall dining experience, I find the place abit noisy, even with the few patrons that were there. It's not as well insulated from noise as I would like it to be.Perhaps I shall revisit in a couple of weeks' time and if the place improves in service and ambience, I can re rate this cafe again
