Now located at central magazine road . Excellent n authentic Japanese food . We went on a Saturday dinner A very cosy n quiet place for chit chat . Not too pricey compared to other Jap place . Service staff very attentive . I was told by the staff , they are usually very quiet on Saturday as they are surrounded by offices . I will definitely return if I want a no-crowd place for relaxing and slow evening . Love their crepe dessert too

it has moved from kampong bahru to the central mall at 5 magazine road, do take note. this place serves authentic oden and definitely a place for drinking with small snacks. Get ambience - not too noisy for catching up. We had the oden, sashimi and some cooked dishes - not bad. Japanese chef dishing up the oden and the boss is a older japanese man who helps out in the kitchen inside. Service is great- especially Andreas (italian and singaporean mix). The uni sashimi we had unfortunately had a strange smell - we did not return it and continued to down it with our sake. Will definitely recommend this place for drinks and food.
