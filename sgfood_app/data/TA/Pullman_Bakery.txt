keep an eye out for the raisin french bread when it comes out of the oven, it never lasts long and is very tasty. For christmas the Stollen also was well made. Just a good spot that is convenient and relatively cost effective too.

Need a quick Meal then this is an ideal place. You can pick up a snack or more here and the food is delicious.

The advertisement outside the shop says that it comes from Hokkaido. Thus, went in to buy something to try. Guess it's not too bad but nothing to shout about as well. The serving staff were not very friendly as well.

This bakery has quite a wide range of selection of bread and they generally taste good. Especially love the loaf here.

A long overdue vote of confidence for this simply superb bakery located at Millenia Walk!
The sublime croissants are the main attraction here, deliciously crisp and perfectly prepared!

Something about this place which always brings me back. Their bread is just different from any other bakery. Fresh, hot, rich, fluffy,....words just can't describe it. Highly recommended. Try it once and you'll definitely be back for more!

Found this by chance when coming out of the metro. Great hot and cold snacks to take away at very reasonable prices. Recommend the melon buns, no melon in them but very light and tasty, the hokai curry buns great for those who love spice and meat all encased in a crispy fried doughnut! Loads of interesting choices. Well worth a tasting trip

I visited Millenia Walk and saw Pullman Bakery. As my wife is a fan of pastries, we decided to drop in and take a look. There was a wide range of breads to choose from and it is pretty pricey as compared to Breadtalk. In the end, we walked out without buying anything because the bread was also very cold and do not look fresh

Pullman originated in Hokkaido, Japan and that is reflected in the offerings. Their traditional croissant was quite good. My Japanese wife preferred it over some other bakeries with high ratings or strong local reputations feeling it had less butter and lighter flavour. I didn't notice that but enjoyed either way. The kougin amman was good though not in typical fashion feeling almost like a tart. The NamaChocopan was just average. The Japanese-ness comes out in other offerings such as Croquette-pan which has Japanese Croquette in the middle of the bun. They have other Japanese offers such as Kurumi pan with nuts in the bun.Overall if you really want specifically Japanese baked goods this may be the best stop for you (or until you discover another Japanese bakery in Singapore). If you just want a good croissant this will work if nearby though other shops with similar quality may be more convenient.
