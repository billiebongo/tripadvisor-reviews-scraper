The kway chap was warm and smooth to send down the delicious braised pork and tofu while a thunderstorm pounded the relatively quiet food court in Holland Village.

Used to frequent the stall regularly some years ago though less so these days, but whenever I am in the area this is one on my bucket list. The Kway is very smooth and thin and the soup is lighter and less saltish yet tasty enough for one to consume the whole bowl of it! Little has changed over the years and remains as consistent as before.

Visited a relative at west coast crescent and wanted nice kway chap nearby. Searched TA and found this shop. Its 15 min drive and the shop is in a hawker centre. Ordered a bowl of mixture of everything the shop has with 2 bowl of kway chap (SGD11). The soup taste good! Try finish the dishes when its hot cause it taste differently when its cold

Relocated from the now defunct Blanco Court hawker centre (with the site taken over by Raffles Hospital), this stall is still serving the best kway chap ever. With its current location in a neighbourhood away from the city, the queues are no longer as long which is good news for their regulars

This is probably one of the best kway chaps in Singapore. The top is To Ricos at Old Airport Road but the long queue is quite a deterrent. Blanco Court Kway Chap on the other hand offers an almost as good kway chap minus the queue. The kway is silky smooth and thin, and offals are braised expertly. While overall taste is not as good as To Ricos, its a good quick fix to that craving when it hits
