Good and cheap authentic Nepali food. Taste of Nepal and the environment inside the restaurant is similar to Nepal. Enjoyed.

Decent place to enjoy Nepali cuisine in Serangoon road area. Momos are soft and delicious. We ordered butter chicken with naan. Chicken dish was creamy and delicious. We also tried Nepali roast lamb meat with vegetables, didn’t like it as much. May be it needs an acquired taste. Overall an enjoyable lunch experience

Just a simple restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Little India, but don't let the décor fool you - this is where really good north Indian food is to be found. I tried it for dinner one evening, dining on Chicken Jazfredi, cheese naan and a cool, spicy yogurt dip....delicious. Total bill was S$13 and I left more than satisfied. This is a popular eatery in the neighborhood and generally packed with locals, very few tourists. Excellent service and a large menu selection. Beer available. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed

Good music, cozy nepalese setup and of course great North-Indian-ish food. Haven't been to Nepal so I can't say it's authentic but the Naans and curries have the great texture and taste. The fried lady's fingers are also DA BOMB! So flaky, crispy and so savoury with the masala spices. Something u can eat as a snack all day long.Service staff are Nepalese and have carried over that warm hospitality to Little India too!Can't wait to go back

To our surprise the food was up to our standard unlike typical Indian restaurant. Chicken momo is a must which was served with red spicy chutney. It was awesome. The chicken tika masala and hariyo saag with Pulau rice were delicious too. Definitely recommend this place to who like to try different type of cuisine and appreciate it.

We found this restaurant by accident when we were walking back to our hotel - and it was packed with people.We wondered into the restaurant a few days later and were not disapointed by the quality of the food on offer and the really interesting menu.I would recommend this place if you want to experience some Nepalease or North Indian cuisine

Went for dinner with my niece. We ordered mutton masala, garlic naan and Gobi Manchurian (cauliflower). Quiet and homely feel with a video playing people trekking and napalese music. Child-friendly with child seat available. There is also happy hour deals. Outdoor seating available. Not very huge so if you are bringing big groups, helpful to make reservation. It takes a while for food to come but it is tasty and home cooked feel. They serve papadam with mint and water while you wait.
4
We ate until we couldn't eat any more. Started with Tigers naturally. Papperdams, Gyosas with a great Mint sauce, samosas with another nice sauce, Nan Breads with Pickled Vegetables, Mutton Vinderloo, Briyani Chicken and a great sauce. More Tigers to wash down. All for $100. All fabulous. Will definitely be back.

I had the pleasure of dining with my family,at this restaurant which is located at a walking distance from little india mrt stn. Its located off the race course road (main road) but can be found easily.Best part of the restaurant is its interior and nice as well as cosy ambience. It has adequate space and quite a long list of dishes on the menu,..I would say it is a mid range restaurant where some dishes are quite cheap and some are a bit priced up. Nevertheless the food is great which includes the Nepalese recipes too... Not to forget about the service part, since it is a highlight of this restaurant. The restaurant is managed by its owner (Mr. Prince) himself who is ready to serve you with a smiling face, everytime you give him a call....Overall its a great place to dine with your family and friends,..Wont regret the visit

Despite not being full with people - one of my favourite places to eat in SG
Must try the naans, thaali set, veg pakora, chicken choila, paneer. Even the chutney that comes with the pappadam is awesome!
5
When in Little India we stumbled upon this place and ordered beer, onion bajis and chicken pakoras and what a treat was served up, absolutely fantastic, cannot think of any fault, we would recommend to anybody.also free wi-fi.

My wife and I dined here last night (28/7) and where pleasantly surprised. The host 'prince' was friendly and responsive. The restaurant got busier throughout our stay but we weren't in a rush and enjoyed a short break between the chicken momo and samosa for entree , both of which were ok. Prawn Marsala and mutton Rogan josh were great, as was the Marsala naan and raiti

I had been to this place on 23 June 7.45 pm. Specially to eat veg momo. Ordered one. The momo were very average. The others top covering was hard and chewy. Looks like they didn't steam momoproperly. i had to literally leave the pieces of the outer covering on the plate. the chutney was good. The inside filing was good and the orange chutney was also good. to recheck if steaming was the issue, i took take away one more plate from same place . later that night i tried to eat it and result is same and threw away the box and it was very very chewy. while leaving chander road just to try i also too on veg momo from place adjacent nepali restaurant. momo were much better.bad experience on momo

My Husband and I enjoyed our lunch here. There was no line to get a table but 3/4 of the tables were occupied when we got there. We decided the chance upon Nepalese cuisine because we never had one. The prices were reasonable, staff were attentive, crowd were a mixed of locals and Nepalese (maybe). We had tandoori roti (unleavened wholemeal flour), masala naan, Pudina Khasi (mutton with potatoes), chicken Manchurian, Gobi 65 (fried cauliflower) and hot Nepalese tea! Our bill came up to S$39 for two. Food was reasonable without MSG. Feels like a homecooked meal as the drawback is the waiting time for the food to be served. Worth a visit again, but not with an empty stomach

I've been here a few times and would recommend it to anyone who wants another take on the Indian food they normally enjoy. The service is good, prices of the food and beer are very reasonable and food is very enjoyable. I loved the crispy Ladys Fingers, in particular.Its only a few minutes walk from Little India MR

Been here twice, love the homey cozy setting. Pleasant and patient staff. Always greet with a smile and even if you take abit longer to decide what to eat, they are always happy to stand by and give you more time. If you are unsure of what to choose, the ladies will be happy to give some recommendations but you must be sure to tell them your likes / dislikes clearly. Food is served piping hot, generous portions, simple no frills dining. If there are large groups before you, be prepared to wait awhile. In true nepalese/north indian style, the kitchen works at the same pace whether there's 1 customer or 100 customers. Price is very decent compared to the other restaurants nearby serving similar food. Be about 10-15 per person. Other restaurants can be double the price

This was my third visit to this cosy restaurant tucked away in Little India. I had three starters, more than sufficient for a moderately hungry solo. This time I tried the steamed veg momos, the deep fried okra, and the spicy scrambled egg. All well cooked and tasty, and very decent portions. Washed down with two Tigers. Friendly staff and other customers. The bill was S$37. Pretty good value I thought.

Visited here recently due to the positive reviews on here. Unfortunately the curries were a bit of a letdown having been hyped up so much. The server guy seemed very nervous and uncomfortable, I imagine he must have been new. The ambience wasn't great as the place was very quiet. Would prefer the Banana Leaf around the corner. One positive I can say is that while looking for this place, it opened my eyes to the many packed alternative restaurants on the same street. Planning to try them at some point in the future to see why they're popular so wasn't a completely wasted journey.

I was here on a Monday and aside from a party of 6 who came in for after-dinner coffees, we were the only people in the restaurant.Not very promising isn't it?But, the food was not bad.The Vegetable Momo was okay. I found the skin a little thick. Since I've never been to Tibet, I can only say it was palatable. The chilli dipping sauce it came with (on the side) was fiery!The crispy ladies finger (okra) was nice, perhaps a little too burnt for my liking.I generally do not like Tandoori Chicken as I find it dry, but the breast meat was surprisingly moist. I also had the Paneer Makhani and a non-spicy fish dish - I forget the name - that was quite nice. A good antidote to the Momo chilli dip

Their momos and chowmein is really good. Other options not too good. Dont go too late on a weekend (their service sucks).
4
After a year in Singapore, we decided we wanted to eat our beloved momos which is so common in metro cities in India and a gift from the himalayan cuisine. The Everest kitchen did not disappoint us although the covering could have been thinner. The chutney with the momos was amazing and very authentic. We also ordered the Chowmein which was so so and had too much soya sauce and we also had some gulab jamun which was also a ho hum ! The biggest shock was asking for Chicken Sekuwa which is a typical Nepalese dish and my wife is Nepalese but what we got was pretty much a chicken tikka ! I dont think the real sekuwa is like that ! But again taste-wise it was flavorful and we enjoyed.The service was very professional although dont expect a fine dining experience as the ambiance is somewhat run down. and Overall from the price point it was a worthy deal to eat at the everest kitchen. But the extra point definitely goes to the delicious momos served
5
My partner and I were visiting from Australia and had lunch here on the recommendation of a friend who used to live in Singapore. The service, food and value at this place were all outstanding. The young Nepalese man who served us was friendly and charming and gave us great suggestions from the menu. I can't remember the name of the dumpling-like entree but it was amazing! So were the dishes that followed. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Little India district
5
Went there for lunch with 2 visitors from Taiwan, 3 of us ordered 5 dishes recommended by the restaurant manager, we finished up everything with our thumbs-up :) Shall come here for dinner soon, since wine, beer and other alcoholic drinks are available in the restaurant as well
5
We went there for having a late lunch. Nevertheless the wanted to close 15 mins later the stuff served us a delicious lunch. They were friendly and very fast in serving the food. The meals cost around 10-12 S$. We can fully recommend this place for authentic food.

Tucked away in a side street in Little India, this restaurant is not on the beaten track, but is worth finding. Their food is a cross between Nepalese, Tibetan and Indian. Every dish we bought was really good - the naan breads were done crispy to perfection. We had butter chicken and chicken tikka, both really good
4
Found the Everest while mooching around Little India & although it's not a 'pretty' looking restaurant we thought we'd take the chance. So glad we did. Our food choices were cooked to perfection & plenty of good quality chicken & mutton in our dishes (no nasty fatty or grissley bits). Garlic naan just how it should be (crispy not soggy). All went down very well with Tiger Beer. All in, a very good, generous sized meal for two with beers - $81.20

Amazing what a change in the Management can do. I had been there earlier and while the food was good the ambience and decor was not very inviting enough for a repeat. But had a chance to drop by again and was very pleasantly surprised. Absolutely refreshing, airy, bright with a touch of class! The food had become even better and the vegetable sheek Kababs and the Okra are absolutely divine!. And these items are vegetarian! This now will become one of my regulars and the best part when I am unable to go can order as they do catering too! I get a feeling this restaurant will be coming up with more surprises and should be watched closely it has the makings of being a gem at 55 Chander Roa

Wanted to try something new, and saw this passing by on prior taxi rides. It's a hole in the wall joint. Glad we tried and will go back. We started with Sukuti, dried meat & tossed with spice...really different flavor, perfect with beer. We ordered 4 other items: vindaloo, dark lentils, butter chicken, and okra. Okra (or lady's finger as it's known here) is perfectly done, still crunchy with the right spice-- my favorite. The butter chicken recommend was a standard and did not stood out for me. All four dishes were of different flavors. The rice quality is decent. Service was very good

Someone recommended us to everest for some good nepalese food. We avoid going to Little indian during weekends so headed to this place on a thursday night. Interiors were a-ok..but the food was fantastic! The yellow dal particularly had a distinct flavor to it..unlike any other I've had here. The complimenatry poppadums were a nice touch. loved it

Lovely, quiet restaurant in Little India. Nice, friendly service. Cheap!

just want to wRn you that the waiting times are just too long. i went there for lunch and it took 40 minutes until the food was served. the food was not bad but there is no excuse for such long wIting time
5
Very tasty and authentic dishes. Great naan too. Definitely worth a visit. Extremely reasonable prices.

Very authentic dishes and nice atmosphere ! Very good service too.

Pleasant lunch with food good and service rather slow (but that was not in issue for us on this occasion). My only concern is the reported location. Other reviews talk about Little India - and this is where I went and the photo looks correct..... But the address is not 518 Macpherson (although there could be an Everest restaurant there, too).... We went to Chander Road (Street?) which runs a parallel with Race Course Road... Which is consistent with other reviews
4
It is one of the place i found restaurant own by Nepalese, a family of ex-Gurkha. had Dalbhat set a Nepalese signature dish and my wife had Butter Naan. Food was very nice, far away from the place i born but the typical authentic tastebwas there. Nepali music at Background was okay but sometimes its loud which is disturbing for those who dont understand it. I been there couples of time and definitely not during the weekend. Some of my friends said its horrible to visit during weekend. Crowed and late service etc, I can't imagine if the food is late when I'm hungry and taste doesn't matter there.

You can head to Muthu's Curry or Banana Leaf Apollo on Racecourse Road. The Indian food is good at both. But, they're doing it in huge quantities so you'll get a one-taste-pleases-all experience.Or... Chandler Road is a small road running parallel to Racecourse Road. It's the next one back if you're walking towards Serangoon Road. There are a few restaurants along Chander, but I think Everest Kitchen, which serves Nepalese, Tibetan and North Indian dishes is the most charming.It's small... about 10 tables (plus a couple out on the footpath)... and you might have to wait a little while for your food to come after you order it. The menu is interesting though, with dishes you won't see in purely Indian restaurants. I think the food is good, the service is personal and it's very moderately priced. A good combination.TIP: They have wine glasses if you bring your own wine

Not going to reach the top of my list. Neither at the bottom. Just okay. Ate the Bindi (veg) dish with naan and coke light. Costed $11 in total. Naan was smaller than expected. But for that price it's worth the size. They could improve service. It's not your upper end place so don't expect too much. Food was okay tasty. Overall an okay place. Might, might think about going back again.

Little India is very interesting, after a walking a good place were eat good food!Staff kind, frindly and very attentive!The food very good and the prices are honest!Go there, you will be happy.Only one little problem...they close aroud 10, 10-30....but all the restaurant are closing so early there...Try all, all is really good!!

Been to this restaurant a few times in the past and used to enjoy the food and service at this simple restaurant. On 11 December 2010, I brought a group of 9 friends for dinner. At abt 8pm I ordered the food. Appetisers came after 20 minutes and main courses came close to 9.30 pm. It was a disaster! Apart from the small portions (which we did not fuss about) the naans were absolutely terrible. They were hard, compressed and had the appearance and taste of leather. Nothing like any naans in any other restaurants and certainly never before from this restaurant. We ordered butter , garlic and kashmiri naans. For the kashmiri naan, it was smeared with cherries as an after thought on a plain naan.I told the waitress that it was disappointing that we had to wait so long for the food (the other tables also had to wait that long) and the naans were terrible. The main courses were small so we had repeat orders for some dishes. However, the repeats tasted different from the first round. Told her that I have been a regular guest and this experience was embarrassing to me as I brought my friends and it would be difficult for me to come back next time. Instead of apologising for the slow service, bad food etc, she replied that it was my choice and we need not come back! She was defiant and said that (in a take it or leave it attitude) they no longer employ Nepalese chefs to cook and that it was the fault of Singapore Govt for that. She did not apologise for the long wait and was absolutely rude.This marginal restaurant depends on mouth to mouth recommendations. This recent experience has demonstrated that it has reached the "sell by date" simply because they think Singapore diners will tolerate bad rude service and terrible food quality. The other diners in the restaurant were also complaining but the waitress just ignored them and glared at them. Incidentally, I think the 'waitress" is related to the owner. This was a truly terrible experience
