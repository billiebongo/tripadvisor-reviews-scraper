For its price, it's actually not bad. I actually prefer this to Keisuke.
It's my first time dining at Chabuton and so far nothing negative.
Service size is good, taste is acceptable and service was efficient.
Won't mind visiting again.

Ordered the tonkotsu ramen, gyoza, kaki fry (oyster), and Chabuton salad. Everything was tasty and arrived within 5-10mins of ordering. Staff members were friendly and efficient. I also liked that they served Sapporo premium beer, which is hard to find where i'm from!

We patron their Star Bista branch and it was quite nice. I wouldn't say it's great but overall it's a nice ramen and nice ambience.

It’s poor practice when chefs who received a Michelin star in their home country advertise such fact, when their Singapore outlets are not awarded; this is the case of Kam’s (best known for roast goose in Hong Kong, but not available here), Tsuta ramen, or Chabuton. The Chabuton ramens are good, but it’s not top 10 in Singapore, maybe not even top 5 in the Orchard Road area! The main advantage is that it’s reasonably priced. They also serve small sizes, so you can taste side dishes, some of which, like Ika karaage (squid), are scrumptious

I actually never had to queue for chabuton ramen and often i wonder why. Coz they serve pretty decent ramen with a slightly more comfortable taste #flavorful but never overpowering and adding on the #ramen #egg that they always seem to get right and of course this lovely piece of buta kakuni (tastes like very good #lorbak) My go to for a quick ramen fix with no queue usually and satisfying food #japanese #sgfoodie #sgfood #food #pork #noodles #japanesefood #singapore #orchard #eats #instafoo

It was my first visit and I was surprised how the fragrance of the soup makes it so delicious and wonderful in every bite! The Ramen Noodles where great , The soup of the ramen was wonderfully made and the char siew meat was full of tender and It was so juicy! I highly recommend this ramen shop Chabuton to you

Irasaymase to its patrons and drinks are served immediately.I ordered the tonkatsu broth with a slice of char siu and bamboo shoots. The cost is S$8.80! Wanting another delicacy I ordered the deep fried squid which is soft and chewy. Mayonnaise with thinly sliced salad came with the squids. I added another flavour ...the vinegerate ginger .. yum.Service was attentive as they keep filling up my tea and together with the soothing Japanese music I was brought to the shores of Japan ....arigato gozaimas

This place serves Japanese ramen but I do not know where the origin is from. I visited the branch at star vista. Ordered the latest addition of hot ramen and they have a scale of 1-5 in terms of spiciness you want. Must warn you, they are really hot and spicy. I simply chose the level 2 and was sweating like nobody's business.Noodles was ok and the broth, maybe I have added too much chili and that blankets away the original taste of the broth

Having heard it was one of the top 3 ramen joints in Singapore, we had high expectations. The Yoruton ramen at level 5 was really spicy with fresh chopped chillis. The spiciness ends up over bearing the rest of the meal. The ramen noodles are cooked well and broth was tasty. Gyozas were oily and felt old. Overall it was a good meal but not outstanding

2 weeks ago I was at the Star Vista branch, the seating is limited and cannot accommodate group larger than 4 ppl. This time we 5 adults + 3 babies managed to be well seated at the Somerset 313 branch. The soup, noodles and the char siew are just at perfect taste and texture. Can also challenge their 5 levels of spiciness

We ordered a set, a bowl of ramen and a bowl of pork rice, plus a plate of gyoza. Noodle is good rice is even better with the burnt smell. Overall are good. Will try other food next time.

The portion is small for the price, soup is too like, not so flavorful. Wanted to get my ramen fixed but a bad choice choosing this restaurant. Probably just not the type of Ranen I like.

We found this delightful restaurant down one end of a row of high end high priced Japanese restaurants. As we were looking for a simple quick meal we were delighted to find the Chabuton.The food was excellent, service fast and courteous and we spend some time there enjoying the atmosphere and delicious food. Unfortunately it was our last night in Singapore so we could not return. Highly recommended.

The ramen is not bad here. I took the lunch set - jr size ramen, side dish, dessert and green tea for $13.50... not a bad intro to this ramen shop. I like the ramen - just nice and not over cook. However, I thought the broth is a little on the salty side... but what is ramen with rich salty soup!!! Worth a visit

Dinner meeting with a few friends here proved a great place to meet and dine. Enjoyed the lovely Japanese dinner. A few of us tried the Yoruton Ramen where you can select the level of spiciness that you would like. Being someone who love eating spicy food, I chose level 3 out of 5 and it was oooh! Really spicy. Basically the spicy chilli comes on top of your meal so you can actually decide how much you want to add. (Or subtract). But truly enjoyed Chabuton's signature tonkotsu soup. We also ordered the tonkotsu miso ramen as well as the Hitokuchi Gyoza. Yummy yum yum. Best of all, this place was not crowded and we ordered the free flow Green Tea which kept us hydrated throughout our meeting.

Came here for a quick dinner this week at the outlet in Somerset. It wasn't too busy and didn't take long to be served. I opted for the shoyu ramen which was perhaps a bit salty for my liking, with broth also not quite as thick. Overall it was ok but not great, or maybe I've just been having too much ramen lately
4
I have tasted many different ramen shops in Japan, Hong Kong, NY and Singapore. I like chabuton because of the following reasons:1) the pork soup is creamy and not too salty; 2) they provide fried shallots which I love to add to the ramen which is delicious.

Speedy and helpful service from the young staff. Prices are cheaper (I feel) than some surrounding outlets and the broth is tasty. Portions are a little small though, even for the "large" option. Had the tonkatsu ramen which I enjoyed, and a BBQ prawn side dish that was quite smoky and umai

Didn't know that was opened by a Michelin star chef, hence the long queue at Millennia Walk. However the business crowd was understanding - eat, chat a little and go. So the queue moves.I like it here as there are different choices of ramen - kids size, normal size. Even for normal size, there is just a bowl of ramen or set with side dishes and drinks. I took one set and one bowl - good for 2 to share the side dishes of gyoza and fried chicken pieces.Soup is not too salty; can taste the brewing of its broth.Noodles were well done; not too soggy.Will definitely return for another bowl!

Chose this place because some food blog wrote that it had one of the best tsukemen in Singapore. Not true. Beginning to think that tsukemen is just not a thing here either. The broth was extremely watery with just a hint of flavour (a bland shoyu aftertaste). The chopped bits of chasiu in the broth were dry. They overloaded the broth with bean sprouts. They charge SGD0.50 for ice water. I had the large portion (SGD12.50) and added an egg. Service is fine
