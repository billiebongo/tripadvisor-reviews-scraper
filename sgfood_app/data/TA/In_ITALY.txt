Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. It was a pleasure to be there and good service. Can recommend for couples dinner.

I had dinner at In Italy when I was had my trip in Singapore. I love the place, Wine taste so great, pizza and pasta are so so great and delicious! Travelers should try!
4
Authentic Italian , better try before closing by end May. Good for both lunch n dinner , value for money especially lunch
4
Love the 6 course degustation menu. Value for money at $150 for two persons. The wine pairing made the meal even more awesome! My fave dishes were the roasted beef and veal ravioli. Superb standards!
5
My Visit with my work colleagues at in ITALY was graced by the friendly staff and Chef Mario. Food was excellent and the service was incredible. I would definitely be making more reservations there and recommend this to all my business colleagues.
4
Very often had lunch there due to authentic Italian boss n value for money during lunch, march onwards they had wine pairing dinner for 2 at $150
5
Their Happy Hour deal for both food and wine is just so good value for money, and the food is really good quality with nice wines. 100% recommended!

Pasta was excellent but for a restaurant whose costs are on the high side was not up to standard. We were often unnoticed when we wanted to order as staff laughed and chatted to each other at the cashier. Also, we felt hurried to finish our mains as the service rushed to clear our plates. Overall a disappointing dining experience.
2
First of all, What are the serving staff doing. talk with eachother and pulling chairs around us like no guests where there? In Singapore the normal way is to automaticly include the service fee to the tab. This is why you as a guest should get a propper service with nothing to complain about. The food. I'm a european and Italien food are quite usual and I been to italy latest last summer. This where not a propper well done Italien dinner maybe at some ordinary lunch place but can not be compared to a real nice italien dinner place. My pasta where "al dente" but still it tasted like purchased pasta, not ok , second of all the other parts of the plate where good but to little compared to the size of the pasta. It all could be summerized to the choise of only two different types of red wines, this fells cheap and not the italien way where the wine lists often has alot of choises and has a high standard. (you can see hundereds of the same bottle around the place, did sorcing get an offer like get 1000 pay for 100?). Still you could see a fine wine room? Overall. Ok as a pricy lunch but dinner, no. Singapore offers to good restaurants where service and tastes are better.
2
Bought a risotto which among other things would include pumpkin and goat cheese. I couldn't find one of these in my dish and got a plain rice dish with no texture or a topping. Quite boring. When we were eating the staff began to close the restaurant. Pulled the chairs and tables over the floor which felt stressful even though they would stay open for one hour more
4
Went at lunch. There was no crowd. Food came quite fast, n was delicious. Generous portions too which we had to pack off as we could not finish
5
I walked into the 2 combined shop houses in Singapore and it's easy to decide to sit outdoor with summer fan to enjoy the lovely Singaporean el fresco dining. The pastas were fantastically cooked and ingredients are fresh. It has a sufficient selection of wine.
5
Went here to try their squid ink pasta. Nice ambience, the Chef will come out to chat with regulars too (not us).
5
We had dinner in this restaurant. It is beautiful and the dishes tasted really great. Clear recommendation if you like Italien food.
5
The opposite of your fake, tomato sauce drowned Italian food. The raw material is of perfect quality, be it tomatoes, burrata, meat, ham, down to the wild catch fish. The recipes are unpretentious, flavorful and perfectly executed. Service is one of the friendliest in the city. And the outdoors area a lovely treat in a place obsessed with aircon. Chris clearly doesn't know what he is talking about, a living proof that writing dozens of reviews by no means makes you a connaisseur
5
A meal out with friends is always a delightful experience. My friends had not been to In Italy previously, so I was extremely happy when they too thought the food to be great.We shared starters and mains of some of Mario's signature dishes. Each unique and absolutely delicious. The staff too friendly and attentive. Could not hsve been a better evening.Thank you Mario and team. You have won over some new friends
3
I wanted to really like this place but it screams tacky from the moment you walk in and it tries to look like fake Italian restaurant with all the things you would expect in an Italian restaurant in Italy not Singapore.It's been designed to look that way and clearly the name says that. However it doesn't follow through on the food. No pizza for example and the pasta wasn't great. Bolognaise too creamy for me and my partner had prawns/pasta that was too garlicly. Her tiramusu wasn't great she said and my chocolate/hazelnut fondant didn't taste of hazelnuts.Shame because I liked the chef who said hi and the staff tried but were not especially personal in their service. Not a place I'd return to when there are so many other Italians in Singapore
5
This is our second visit to in Italy restaurant, must say this was our best Italian meal since very long time! Mario the chef was not there but the quality and standards are high! We had great homemade pasta which was to die for and the meat superb. Great espresso
4
The restuarant consists of 2 pernakan houses with outdoor seating. It has a quaint decor but spacious too. The service was prompt but the meal was served at a good pace allowing us to enjoy conversation.The menu is diverse with a good selection of starters mains and desserts. It is a bit expensive for what you were paying so not 5 stars for value. However I enjoyed the ambience and good service
3
If you are still enjoying and possibly nibbling at the food at the table, be sure to tell the service crew. We thought they were only going to clear the empty plates when they asked if they could clear them. We were in a conversation and didn't notice they cleared the entire table including 2 other dishes which were clearly half finished
5
We were looking for an excellent pasta restauran and we had come to the right place. All three pasta that we ordered, were tasty and al dente. Restaurant is clean and cozy.
5
We were here for our wedding anniversary, also to take advantage of the 1-for-1 degustation menu. It was a 5-course yumminess all the way. Very chill environment on a weekday night. The house wine was also great, went really well with the dishes.
4
Food was very very good. We have asked our waiter to recommend a wine and it was delicious!
Great place for family or for friends dinner gatherings.
5
Good service, good food n good wine. Any chese dishes are recommended and I like pasta here. Good selection of wine. Hve gold choice of glass wine as well.
5
We have probably been here 10 times in the last year or so, and it has never disappointed. The staff are all excellent, and make you feel like you're not just a random face.The food menu may be slightly limited compared to some other places, but it's still more than adequate and having tried pretty much everything on the menu I can safely say that whoever is in the kitchen knows what they are doing.The lighting may be a shade on the bright side, but it's nothing off-putting, and the food is good enough to make you forget about taht anyway.I think the owner has his own family vineyard in Australia and imports some of the wine here - and that is also well worth the try.The Orechiette may be my favourite dish in all of Singapore
4
My wife and I stopped in after seeing the Italian restaurant that we had planned to go to closed until Jan. 3rd. We were keen on Italian and saw this place just up the road. The menu looked comprehensive but not overwhelming. The mains seemed a bit seafood heavy so we turned our attention to the pasta items. We ordered the ravioli and risotto (rice) dish. Both dishes were outstanding. We also had a glass of house Chianti each, mixed olive app and a dessert. The bill was nearly $150 SGD. The wine prices were pretty normal for Singapore but I thought the apps were expensive and some of the mains and pastas were as well. Not taking the price into the equation the food was tasty and service was quick. The whole crew were serving our table and never got in the way or had us waiting for something. We might go back at some point but there are 1000s of restaurants to try here in Singapore
4
We have been to this restaurant at least 4 time during the last 2 years. We were never disappointed. The service is very attentive (same staff for the last 2 years I think) and the quality of each meal is very good. Reasonable in term of pricing. Good value for money
4
Visited for the first time on a fairly quiet Saturday evening, with most of the crowd coming in after 8pm. The food by chef Mario was delicious, while the service from our waiter, also called Mario, couldn't have been warmer. The premises are large in area, chic, with a few outdoor tables for drinks. We enjoyed our starters of aglio olio pasta and lobster home-made spaghetti, and rucola salad. Our mains of steak fillet, quail with truffles, and red tuna steak were all good. We also liked the desserts - limoncello soufflÃ© and proseco panna cotta. All in all, an enjoyable meal and a place we would come back to.
5
food was great, ordered the soft shell crab squid ink risoni and it tasted great! The french spring chicken was not too bad. a safe choice by us, nothing much to shout about. But it was a nice place to dine in. They were nice to let us know that we were entitled to happy hour. They also reminded the other guests too. :)
4
Had an excellent Sunday lunch here - great service and the food is beyond your typical Italian fare in Singapore. Could probably do with a decorative refresh and a revamp of their weekend offering - why, with food this good were we only one of two tables is inexplicable. Note to owners/ management: get interested. Otherwise faultles
5
Restaurant should have been more full on a quiet Sunday evening, but a good few people in. All the pasta dishes were beautifully made. Quail stuffed with fois gras was spectacular with great sauce. Desserts were lovely. Attentive staff, nice to talk to the Chef.
5
At lunch on weekdays, the Italian lunch menu was 'perfect'. All selections were wonderful. We enjoyed ourselves with the cost atmosphere and great service too! Will definitely be back.
4
Attentive service with good food, make an effort to surprise my friend who was celebrating birthday.
4
This was a casual work lunch so we did not order the full device just appetisers and drinks.
Of note are the asparagus with egg and cheese very very good. Drinks are good size.
Very good.
4
This restaurant has been around for quite some time but I didn't have a chance to visit. So, i decided to give a try with my friend. I really enjoyed the food and ambience. Will definitely come back soon for sure!
2
Service was poor. Staff has no initiative they just gave yes/no reply to our query witbout any suggestions.
4
We have been visiting the place for past few years. It is good for a couple or a larger groups. Food has always been nice and enjoyable. However, it is not cheap. The selection of wine is so so. I will go for beer instead. It is a noisy place but more lively. If you don't mind to fork out 40-60 per head, it has nice food here.
5
My partner and I enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The service was attentive, but never intrusive. Food wise ... We started off the meal with their signature Italian 'sashimi' appetiser. I felt the portions were too small and frankly, nothing on the platter really wowed me. The two mains that we ordered were the home-made veal ravioli and roasted French quail. They were absolutely delicious and we enjoyed every morsel! The bottle of white wine recommended by our server was divine. I found out later that the vineyard is owned by the chef himself, hence the wine can only be purchased at the restaurant, and is not found anywhere else. I will not hesitate to order it again the next time I dine there. Overall, a great dining experience
5
Given the massive number of restaurants (even in the Duxton/ Craig Rd area) and in a city where one can find several types of cuisine , InItaly remains the place of choice for an above-causal Italian Italian restaurantThey seemed to be a little short staffed the evening we were there, so was a little apprehensive that my first-visit guests might not have a memorable experience.Some minutes into the visit we found that the Shiraz recommended was more than drinkable, and ended up chatting with the owner about his vineyard and walking out at the end of the evening with a few bottles (paid for of course) under our armsThe pesto-like dip served with the bread basket was not the usual fare...We had the burrata, squid ink pasta, ravioli and an array of desserts...Food was, as always, great ... and a good time was had by all : - 
5
This little place is heaven for food lovers! A rustic and charming restaurant with cool service and a great Chef. Yes, it's all about amazing food there. I actually can not describe it in words so WoW it was. The best dish actually a dessert with the base of pistachio, one of the best desserts I ever had.Well Done
5
Nice atmosphere, good service (which is not a given in Sg) and wonderful food. A little pricey, but very nice and authentic Italian food. We always enjoy the restaurant, good specials and nice wine selection.
4
great Italian food plus lovely wine from Chef Mario own vineyard.
Recommend squid-ink pasta and vogole pasta.
4
Very friendly welcome by Host Mario.
The cheese pre dinner exceptional with a glass of chardonnay.
Best quail I have ever eaten. Not lunch but a gastronomic experience.
thoroughly enjoyed the experience. will be back again.

Must must must make reservation in advance especially on Friday and Saturday night!I love the cheese flakes (recommended to share), you can eat it by it own, or add in on your pasta or with wine. The spaghetti al-dente (aglio-olio) no doubt the texture of the spaghetti is really al-dente, but the sauce is a little bit too wet. A very special dessert to recommend is "The Italian Vigra" - Zabaglione, very refreshing (contains alcohol - Moscato, sorbet and crumble.
4
A charming haven of taste in Craig road. Chef Mario uses the freshest ingredients to perform his miracles in the kitchen and produce some first class Italian food. Presentation is professional in a place that exudes laid back charm and class, and the food is heaven. Complemented by a wide range of fine wines -including the owners own form the Granite belt of Queensland. Dinner menu and great deal Lunch menus as well as seasonal promotions like truffle season. Prices for Singapore mean great value.

The good side is they are right on the dot with your reservation with Chope. They were already expecting me when I showed up at their door. The maitre'D made it a point to remember my name. Ambience was good. Nice decoration and good background music. My wife and I both ordered pasta. My wife claims that even though she was not someone that would order pasta found it very delicious. Myself on the order hand found that the tagliatelle not to what I know from Bologna, Emilia-Romagna. But 1 of the better ones I have tasted in Singapore.What went wrong though:1) The "free pasta" with a main ordered promotion stated on Chope. I'm not sure if there was a miscommunication somewhere because it was not stated that the offer was only valid if a single diner walks in. My wife and I were considered 2 diners and we were advised that the promo was only available to us if we have order 2 pasta dishes or 1 main and 1 pasta dish in order to get the free pasta. I'm thinking why would 2 diners order food for 3 guests. At any rate, I accepted this because of the clause stating that the restaurant's decision is final in the event of any misinformation. However, this is ambiguous and misleads people into going to the restaurant.2) Food ordered was not followed up. We ordered 2 pasta dishes and a side dish. The pastas came but the side was forgotten. I was somewhat looking forward to that to go with my pasta but in the end it was forgotten. They asked if I could wait 10 minutes for it to be prepared but my pasta was already cold.3) Double whammy and I'm already quite not happy. I told him the whole situation and I'm not happy. The maitre'd decided to make amends. He even informed us of it. But I'm not one of those people to look for freebies. I politely decline his reparations but he insisted. He placed a tiramisu for 2 on the table and informed that we need not take it if we don't want to. I'm not a Tiramisu lover. My wife is but she is not angry like I am for this whole evening that went wrong.My hats off to the Maitre'D for trying to salvage the evening. He snucked in a 10% discount on our pastas at the end of the day. However, like I said I'm not one looking for freebies.Ps to the Maitre'D: When someone has a bad day when nothing is going right for him, the last thing he/she needs is someone to improvise on the situation to make him feel better. He or she probably just needs that 1 thing to go right for him when everything else went wrong that day
4
We dined on a weekend and the restaurant wasn't full. It was easy to find and a proved to be a nice cosy place. Parking is available across the street which was great. Food was decent but the service was lacking. They seemed to be shorthanded. Our bread was served after the mains came and after i asked for it. Water was not topped out too. Overall a decent experience but nothing extraordinarily special.
5
In Italy on Craig road has become one of my Favourite Italian food restaurants where served quality food which I certainly don't mind to pay. Having variety of wine lists are plus points that can choose to order a bottle or half bottle. But better order for a bottle as price tags are not much difference. Not only having good food to offer, staffs are friendly and have good product knowledge with offering options when needed
4
Went there for dinner with another couple recently as the restaurant was recommended by a colleague. Overall, the food was delicious - almost everything we ordered hit the spot and we really enjoyed the bread basket too. Just a couple of things - the service was not up to par compared to other Italian restaurants in town like Etna, da Valentino's or Amarone. Took us at least 20 minutes to get someone to take our order and then the waiters forgot to refill our wine glasses as well as our mineral water.The other thing that I didn't quite enjoy so much was the home made pasta - it was a bit too chewy for my liking. Other than that, the rest of the food was very good
4
It is a good bet for reliable good hearty Italian. Nothing too fancy but nice and delicious.Pastas are really quite affordable. The lobster pasta is only $38.The aglio olio vongole, chittara (spaghetti with lobster) and spaghetti ala Singaporeana were all good. My friend did not like his risoni.Desserts were $14-18. All of them were good: tiramisu, lemon soufflÃ©, chocolate and hazelnut fondant and zabaglione (they called it the Italian viagra).The puffy bread was nice.We had to ask for refill of water
4
Good selection of authentic Italian food.
Love the steak too. Chef Mario is friendly and the wine selection is good too although rather expensive for Aussie wine.
5
Probably my 10th time to InItaly, and certainly not my last. The food and wine is fantastic, the staff are exceptional. We had a party of 18 and as always InItaly was very accommodating!
5
Not been back for a while so good to see this remains a sensational restaurant. Food is bursting with flavour, right portion size,generous measure of wine by the glass and good value for money. Highly recommended
5
the food is delicious, the staff is friendly and nice
good wine list .My partner ate the Squid ink spaghetti . I preferred the risotto.
Both were very good.
4
I reviewed this place a few months ago.But is was luch time then and I have been back another couple of times, just because it is a nice place, good service and the food is straight forward good. Very tasty.For dinner it was the same. Only one thing was a disappointment is the music. Seriously wrong choice, especially when you put the music so loud. There are so much nicer back-ground tunes, like Puro Beach lounge or similar. On soundcloud you can find anything in that style and it would be definitely better than the screaming pop music. Or turn it down in volume so everybody can still have a nice evening
5
In Italy is a great Italian where you find a menu without the “usual suspects“ like spaghetti carbonara or else.Yes you find some mainstream Italian dishes but where else do you find raspadura (traditional grana lodigiano shavings) or truffles at a reasonable price for example.On my visit I had an excellent dish of home made pappardelle with egg and scorzone (the summer truffle from Italy), followed by a very nice roasted deboned quail filled with foie gras and a tiramisu` for dessert. All food prepared properly and coming with complete flavors,nothing missing nothing too much in other words right to the point.I understand the oaner produces wine in his vineyard in qweensland which I personally found interesting.On this note we really enjoed the unwooded chardonnay followed then by a young shiraz.Mr. Mario the owner, is very passionate about what he does and is a welcoming host running a very good team in front and back of the house.All in all I`d visit in Italy in my future trips to Singapore and as an Italian I can say that you can have a great Italian fine dining experience in a confotable setting without having to break your piggy bank
4
Came across this place whilst walking around the area - The outside looks good so we decided to give it a go.The menu is pretty good and the food fulfilled its promise - wine list is adequate and reasonably priced (for Singapore) Staff were efficient and friendly - I would recommend this place and would probably go bac
5
I passed by this place so many times, but never went in. Now just for lunch this time and I was very positively surprised. Even if I wanted to be very critical, I cannot find any minus points. This place fits your budget as well as your taste buds. And very good service as well. I will be back for dinner
5
The best ravioli all'ossobuco, fantastic maialino al forno, autentic and excellent Tiramisu!! The great wines that we have tried are produced in the owner vineyard.It was amazing!!! A place that you cannot miss if you want taste authentic and fine dining Italian Cuisine in Singapore
5
My Husband and I visited for lunch last week and were not disappointed. We had the set lunch and it was great value. The food was excellent and the service was good. The burrata and Parma ham was delicious and it was lovely that the owner and Chef Marrio, came and chatted to us about his food and vineyard. Great to get that personal touch. Will definitely return
4
Good ambience, not too noisy/crowded, no mosquitoes even when we were seated outdoors. The tuna was excellent, as was the burrata. Will definitely return and recommend!
4
We went there for dinner on weekday without reservation.
We were lucky to have a table outside and we really enjoyed our dinner. I specially recommend the squid ink pasta - delicious
Prices are reasonable and staff very friendly
4
This was my second time there. Real Italian cuisine cooked by Italian chef. Ambiance and service was superb! Multistory car park available directly opposite the place. Will definitely return in the near future.
5
A small menu done exquisitely well.
Beautifully crafted, handmade pastas with rich flavoured sauces, great wine list and coffee you'd cross town for.
3
Went for lunch with girlfriend.Despite only two tables being occupied when we got there, service was quite slow and staff fairly aloof. Even the chef stepping out to take break few times had a grim expression.. In the appetiser, Focaccia was very good and recommended. In the mains, Chitarra was enjoyable, the home made egg spagetti was good Our dissatisfaction with the mains was for a few reasons. For such a recommended restaurant, the mains were cold by the time they arrived to the table. This is such a basic requirement to be mindful of at a good restaurant. The squid ink pasta was so average, and being served almost cold made it even more so. We didn't enjoy it one bit.The Chitarra would have been far more enjoyable had it been served hot.While we had a bottle of wine with the food, the lunch was really brightened up by the dessert and coffee we ordered at the end. The dessert was simply diving and tiramisu mark of a true italian restaurant! Their coffee were excellant
4
Just stopped by last night because I miss Italy so much and was delighted to find inITALY. The food was good, we had the appetizer Porceta (dont remember if thats the correct name though), Squid Ink ala Singaporean, Tagliatele Ragu and Suckling Pig. Beside the Ragu, all the rest was very good, with the Squid Ink being the highlight of the meal. The atmosphere is comfortable, the house wine was a Shiraz and was good. Too bad I couldn't go for more due to my training, or else I would have gone for a whole bottle!Definitely will come back and recommend to people.
4
In Italy is one of my favourite Italian restaurants - it was cozy, great atmosphere, delicious food, great service and reasonable prices. I had a dinner for 6 pax, and it was fantastic! I will always go back :-) They also started to have ladies nights on Wed with prosecco at $5 per glass!!
5
Found this place as i was looking for a nice place to celebrate early Valentine's day.Made a reservation after reading some good review and definitely worth the visit.Located in a nice cosy pre-war house, it has an old world charm to it. The service is excellent, waiting staff are attentive but not intrusive.The food is tastier than other italian restaurant we had visited and it is unique too.We thoroughly enjoy the evening there.
5
Our meals were excellent and the service was impeccable. First course--The Real Raspadura, Pomodori, and Asparagus alla Bismark--all scrumptious. The Main Dish: Parmigiana di Melanzane melted in your mouth--exquisite! I didn't want my meal to end. We also enjoyed Quaglia and Aqua Pazza. I felt as if I was transported back to Tuscany! The Chianti Classico was superb. A fun night for a reunion of friends! Chef Mario Caramella's creations are not to be missed. Now my number one Italian restaurant in Singapore; cannot wait to return soon
5
Most of the dishes I had were above average, the suckling pig, and the quail were wonderfully done. Would recommend it for people with deep pockets but demand quality. About $92 per person for 3 mains, 3 antipasti, 2 glasses of wine and 2 desserts, for 3 of us
4
Had a fabulous time celebrating my friend's birthday!Service was excellent!Would highly recommend this place.
4
Was disappointed that they ran out of the suckling pig which I had been wanting to try. Overall experience was good, though this visit had some hit and misses with the food. Tomato soup good as always but the mussels were not as fresh.
5
Nice Italian restaurant in Craig Road, chef and staff are very nice, warm and attentive. Food traditional, with excellent taste and touch from the northern Italian chef. Absolutely recommended.
5
Cosy restaurant with impressive dishes. The service was excellent and we were recommended a few dishes including the raspadura and fiorentina steak which is good for sharing between 4~5 persons. Very good dough-bread freshly baked out of the oven. I would visit again anytime.
4
This restaurant was recommended by our hotel concierge. The flavors were pretty good, and the quality of ingredients came through.
I find the place a little pricey but we did enjoy the dishes.
Lobster pasta
Quail stuffed with foie gras
Steak
5
in ITALY - the cuisine is authentic, delicious and full of flavour. Chef Mario is a true Italian chef that cooks with soul and heart.
Must try "Tagliatelle with Bolognese ragu"
Great ambience and very friendly service staff.
5
I was first time to go to here with my wife. As I had been expected, it was excellent! All meal great and their staff as well. Definitely I'll visit again. Mario chef, thank you very much for taking a photo together.
4
We ordered 2 risottos - squid ink with crabs and eel with berry and beetroot sauce. Preferred the squid ink one however if this is going to be your first few dates I would warn against this one as the ink gives you the mouth of a zombie. The lodigiano cheese flakes are amazing. Service is prompt and the waiters are knowledgable about the menu
4
The staff were attentive and very friendly. They made a mistake from over-cooking the Tuna but they promptly changed the dish without any questions asked.I would recommend this place to people who are looking to celebrate meaningful events with their loved ones and also people who are looking for a nice cozy place to enjoy Italian food.

restaurant in Italy is a portal that transcends space and time, through the door you have the impression of having been thrown in the 80s in a typical restaurant of the Po Valley in Italy. The restaurant has maybe two dozen tables. Book has been a wise decision. In the background, an unusual selection of music, not the usual sickly sweet Italian music, but rather Ramones and punk-rock that have definitely made the environment a bit more interesting, but still relaxed. In the air fragrances of home made bread and "gnocchifritti" served at the beginning of your meal with "salsa verde". The owner and Chef Mario Caramella is between tables, making available its volcanic sympathy and wisdom, recommending wines and dishes. The menu has an interesting selection and changes quite often, perhaps most notably a "gran bollito" and a squid ink tagliolini, a modest selection of pizzas and desserts. Forget to find American-horror-style dishes, like the cesar salad or spaghetti alfredo. you cross the threshold, you are in Italy. prices more than reasonable. I will be back again and againil ristorante in italy è un portale che trascende spazio e tempo, attraversata la porta si ha l'impressione di esser stati catapultati negli anni 80 in un tipico ristorante della pianura padana in italia. Il ristorante ha forse due ventina di tavoli. Prenotare é stata una saggia decisione. In sottofondo una insolita selezione musicale, non la solita smielata musica Italiana, bensí Ramones e altry gruppi punk-rock che hanno sicuramente reso l ambiente interessante ma comunque rilassato, freagranze di pane fatto in casa e gnocchi fritti nell aria. Il Proprietario e Chef Mario Caramella si aggira tra i tavoli, mettendo a disposizione la sua vulcanica simpatia e saggezza, consigliando vini e pietanze. Il menu, ha una selezione interessante e cambia abbastanza spesso, spicca tra tutti un gran bollito, squid ink tagliolini, una modesta selezione di pizze e desserts. scordatevi di trovare piatti stile horror americano, come la cesar salad o spaghetti alfredo. varcata la soglia, siamo in italy. prezzi piu che ragionevol
4
Quite authentic Italian eatery in Singapore offering a good selection of dishes. Taste is good, service attentive. If you want to break away from more traditional cuisines, this is a good option.
3
Tasty food, menu changes quite often. Service can be hit and miss, but above average for SGP.
Been with groups both times and they accommodated our (loud) group very nicely.
5
We had dinner there last night. Great Italian food, good wine list and service .Squid ink spaghetti was great as was the Vongoli spaghetti. Would recommend and will dine there again.
5
Great food !!! Love eating here !! Everything from the food to the ambiance was perfect !!! I would suggest this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore!!!
5
Came here last month for dinner and had a great authentic Italian dining experience. The food was honest, rustic and packed full of flavour - no messing around with playing and good simple food. One of the most tries is the raspadura which is the thinly grated grana padana cheese. This really melts in the mouth! Service was attentive and a good selections to please. Not a cheap dinner but certainly but good value for money in terms of the Singapore market
4
This restaurant offered us western style food without too much fuss which suited a couple of frazzled tourists.The menu is very interesting with some dishes that we had not come across before & all of the food was excellent. As was the service.With most dishes around $30 we were a bit stunned by a $180 bill for 3 dishes, 2 wines, 1 water ,1 coffee & a desert
5
We discovered this restaurant by accident a year ago and have visited several times since, last in October 2015.The menu is not too long, which means one is able to actually make an informed choice. There are some longstanding favorites, such as the quail, or the chilled spaghetti that never fail to please.On our last visit, we tried the roast piglet. Spiced with Italian/ Mediterranean herbs, this is crackling to perfection pork skin with succulent meat.Two things need special mention. One is the excellent deserts- zabaglione is not a common sight anymore these days, and here it is done to perfection. The modern take on the canoli is amazing.The other is- the patron- chef also owns a vineyard in Queensland. We tried his Shiraz, and while this is maybe not what one would call a sophisticated wine, we all liked it a lot, and the designated drivers regretted their lot.We will be back, for sure
4
The bomboloni is served free with a refreshing pesto dip-- perfect with the bottle of Riesling we brought along with us (and which was not charged corkage fee!). Unforgettably delectable suckling pig. Friendly and well-trained waitstaff. We tried three kinds of pasta-- all winners. The only sour point is the bathroom which smells like sewer. (But one can overlook this.)Will eat here again soon

This was probably the best italian restaurant I've tried in Singapore. I was there a couple of times . Everything was great , from the service to the food being served. It was a pleasant experience. Certainly . I'll be going back there again! I love the food! Indeed , it was money well-spen

The restaurant is filled with warm ambience and selective music. Chef Mario and the team are very attentive, heart-warming, and always trying to provide the best service they could. Burrata was an outstanding dish I had for starter. Along the burrata cheese and parma ham, the very juicy and sweet tomatoes harmonized the dish so perfectly; And for my main course, I ordered the gorgeous-tasty ravioli. The restaurant has various option for Italian wines, but the house wines are specially recommended. I'm looking forward to visit and dine in the restaurant again

HIGHLY Recommend!!!!

When I walked into this place the beautiful smells of Italy surrounded me. I was seated promptly but felt the tables were a bit too snug for comfort. I couldn't help but hear the gentleman next to us entire conversation. My friend and I shared a starter which was really nice. I ordered the risotto for my main. I was really looking forward to it but was extremely dissapointed. The flavours were just okay and the rice was still crunchy. It had taken quite a long time for our order to arrive so I wasn't keen to send it back and wait for another one to be made. My friend had the gnocchi which was nice but the sauce was a bit bland. The prices for pasta and risotto were quite high and again the service was very slow. The table next to us had to ask for their meal to be packed for takeaway because it took so long. Overall, I really wanted to love this place but I won't be going back
4
We ordered 5 starters, half suckling pig, a T-bone steak, 6 pasta to share among 9 of us. The tomato in the burata and salad are so sweet, it is imported from Italy. The crisp bread is fresh from oven... I like the pumpkin risotto and the vongole. Give a try to the suckling pig, it is different from the Chinese style suckling pig. Whereby their is with meat (not just skin) yet the skin is still crispy (crackling). The T-bone steak is Ok - abit too salty! In-fact the starter is more interesting than the main course. If you like pistachio, a must to order the pistachio ice-cream ($9/scoop). Yummy!The service is excellent, they are very friendly.You will get to meet the owner (Chef Mario), he will come out and ask for your feedback when almost done with you main course

in ITALY is famous for its fine food and fantastic Prosecco! We have just discovered that it is no only $5 a glass on Wednesdays. We checked it out last Wednesday and got to enjoy one of our favourite restaurants on the cheap! We love to sit outside on the high stools and sip chilled Prosecco while watching the world go by. No we can have a great night for under $50 all in! Mario says he will keep it going every Wednesday, Life just got better
5
Very nice experience in this authentic italy restaurant. Probably the best one i ever have in singapore. The service staff are very efficient and professional, very friendly and treat the customers like one of their family. Been e many times and left with a smiling face, didnt leave with a disappointment before
5
This is a really great restaurant! Cozy, comfort, the staff is so nice and the Chef Owner welcome us very friendly! Wonderful pasta, quails with beacon and foie gras is unbelievable tasty! The most fantastic dish is their famous suckling pig! Crackling crispy on the skin, tender, juicy on the meat! Can't resists to have another one! Fantastic
5
Having visited inITALY for lunch on a few occasions, I decided to host a friends birthday dinner at inITALY due to the level of service that Chef Mario and his team had shown me in the past. Without fail they delivered, serving outstanding Italian, homemade food for over 30 guests. We even got to taste Mario's own wine from his vineyard in Australia...tremendous!For me, inITALY is a real taste of Italy in Asia. As mentioned, one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore due to the real Italian feel, taste and service.Keep up the good work Mario! See you again very soon
5
A lovely place with outstanding service! The food is heavenly delicious. Absolutely recommended! I will be sure to come back for their tasty suckling pig next time i visit Singapore.

We had a good dinner at In Italy. Despite the place can be a bit noisy, the food was of very good quality and fresh. Service was efficient, although it could be a bit more personable. Overall, a good experience.
5
I was in transit through Singapore and had dinner at in Italy. From the second we walked in to the settling of the check, the service was very attentive and the restaurant had a wonderful vibe. The food was extremely authentic and very good value for money! Will definitely return on my next trip. JPGlobetrotter85, relax mate... take a deep breath and think about what you write... get a life
5
I am not sure what that guy JPGlobetrotters85 is on about.. I think it is a scam review and looks as though he is out to destroy!! We always make a habit of visiting this restaurant when I am in Singapore, and refer all our friends to it who are visiting Singapore. The staff are fabulous, food is exquisite and there is absolutely nothing to complain about.I thoroughly RECOMMEND in ITALY as rate it amongst the best I have dined at
4
This Italian restaurant offered the seasonal black truffle menu. I ordered the paradella pasta with black truffle, and it was awesome! The service was great and I enjoyed my dinning experience at In Italy! It was my birthday month, thanks to the Survival Chic which offered 2 glasses of complimentary wine plus the dining benefit of 30% discount. It was a great way to celebrate my birthday with my friends.

Singapore it's well known because of the very bad/basic service in restaurants. Especially when we're used to high quality standards. However there's nothing too much to say about this place. Food was ok/average but service was POOR/BAD/BASIC/DISGUSTING. Next time I'll be trying to sing a 6MM$ dial with clients I'll never be there again. Neither to my worst enemy I would suggest that. I've found better service at Lau Pa Sat and even Maxwell Hawker Center. So, never again

Chef Mario was previously the head chef at Grissini at the Grand Hyatt in HK, which translates well into the high quality Italian fare at his newest restaurant in SG. Great for group dinners or date night. Service is superb. Highly recommend the exclusive wines he gets from artisanal winemakers, burrata, suckling pig and steak. Pastas were decent but not as good as the proteins
5
In ITALY located near Duxton Hill, it is truly authentic Italian restaurant, Mario Caramella, owner and chef is defiantly different: he only cook the things that he love to cook, With its fascinating and exceptional food, elegant shop house setting and casual-fine-dining vibe, In ITALY is one of the original and best Italian restaurant in Singapore that I love it is a truly culinary experience. I was very impressed with the Great Incredible food, Great Wines, and impeccable service and an amazingly comfortable atmosphere. Definitely a must if you are in Singapore. Molto grazie
5
For the first time in our many visits to this great restaurant, we opted to do Sunday Lunch. We were tempted back because Black Truffles are in season, and there is a special Truffle menu, and because Mario has a ''special" of Suckling Pig. Something he has not done before, and notwithstanding how popular pork is here in Singapore in any form. Brave move indeed.As always an amazing greeting awaits you on arrival. What to have for lunch without food envy was decided by us both opting for Beef Carpaccio with Truffle , and Suckling Pig.We were not disappointed. The Carpaccio was delicious, especially with the addition of Truffle....fantastic. Followed by 1/4 of Suckling Pig carved into thick crispy, meaty slices accompanied by the most amazingly flavoured onions and peppers with a selection of add your own condiments...YUM.. Suckling Successful !!Our food was complemented by superb Caramella wines from Mario's own estate Eight Acres. What could be more perfect on a Sunday. We were hard pushed to think of a better lunch in all of our travels.Congratulations Mario another winner. It was also good to see you in daylight too. Haha...and it won't be long before we visit you again..there are still other dishes on your current menu we want to try before they change. Thanks to you and your team. Brilliant as always

I was looking for somewhere new to try. Dutton area has a huge offering of eateries. I found this through Chope, the menu choice was interesting enough for me to book a table.I was impressed that as well as the email confirmation from a hope, I also received one from the Chef/patron.The food was served promptly, large portions. I opted for the mussel/clam starter, my husband had the crostini, a delicious flat bread with cheese , olives and onions.Main course I had the veal ravioli, great pasta, a lovely saffron sauce and lemon gremolata made for a delicious dish.My husband chose a dish that was on the weekday menu, spaghetti carbonara. There was no problem with ordering it at the weekend.Staff attentive, courteous.We didn't have any room for desserts.Next time we will leave some roo
4
I've been here many times and the quality of food is still excellent. Homemade pasta. I like the vongole pasta and soufflé.
Service levels vary- when you sit outside they sometimes forget about you.
5
It is underrated, the food is extraordinary delicious, the staff are friendly and nice, the wine selection is really good, I will come definitely if I will be in Singapore in future
5
Chef Mario is a genius in the kitchen. He's also one of the most affable and charismatic hosts I've ever come across in Singapore. The ambience is cosy, the service is second to none and 'in Italy' serves up authentic, old school Italian cuisine, true to its culinary heritage in a casual fine dining setting which is neither pretentious nor laid back.The Green Asparagus, Fried Egg, Raspadura Cheese & Butter Sauce and the Orecchiette Pasta with Forest Mushrooms were both to die for.Grazie Grazie Grazie! Fantastico

We have been to In Italy before and the food was delightful then. This time I decided to give my wife a special night out on a special day.We reached at around 6.10pm and the restaurant was empty. However, because of a mega booking, we were forced to the outdoor seating area.Once we got seated, it started to pour heavily. The staff promptly open the sheltered mechanism and managed to keep the place dry and maintained a comfortable dining experience. Nonetheless, the fan wasn't on a strong speed so I was actually feeling rather warm at the outdoor seats. Our baby, too, was sweating buckets!We had some excellent parma ham (I will definitely get this again!), squid ink pasta which was good but not the best, and our favourite medium steak which was delightful.Toward the end of the meal, we tried the sheep milk pistachio dessert and my wife was treated to a chocolate lava cake FOC for our little celebration.All in all, a decent and authentic Italian experience which I would return for
4
When we went to eat at this casual Italian, we could really feel that the owner also owns vineyards in Italy! They have a nice variety of food from the traditional Pappardelle, Potato Gnocchi and Risotto to Caciucco, to the Fritto Misto and Acqua Pazza-- and the wine menu is excellent too (Montepulciano D’Abruzzo, Chianti, Valpolicella). The value is quite good and it’s centrally located. Overall, thumbs up
5
First time to inItaly and very impressed with the food particularly the appetizers - the Polipo (octopus with cannelloni beans) was delicious & especially enjoyed the crunchy burst of flavor from the pink peppercorns - the Burrata here I'd rate as one of the better ones in town with a nice touch of marinated peppers
5
inItaly is consistently fantastic, we have been coming here since they opened and it eveners fails to impress! We love the seasonal menu with white asparagus now in season, later in the year it is the truffles, all flown in from Italy weekly. The prosecco is cold and dry almost as dry as Mario's sense of humour. We just found out they are open for lunch, can't believe we have not known this for the last three years! Looking forward to some long lunches in teh not too distant future.Recommendations:Sit out on the TerraceDry Prosecco + RaspaduraStracciatellaAsk for the specialsSea Urchin cold spaghettiBisteca + BrunelloTiramisu + short macchiato/espresso or ristrett
5
I was in Singapore for the week end and I stumble in this Original Italian restaurant and I was very impressed with the amazing food that Chef Mario Caramella delivers to its guests. I had delicious White asparagus and exceptional lasagna alla Bolognese and a great tiramisu. Great Wines from the cellar available as well. Choice of outside seating. Highly recommended 
5
Heard about this restaurant from a friend who lives in Singapore. Made an effort to visit this restaurant when i was in Sg for short trip. This has to be one of the best restaurants in Sg that i have been to so far! Service was good, the chef is so friendly and enthusiatic - its so obvious he is so passionate about his food and work. There were 4 of us so we ordered to share. The tagliatelle and orecchiette was pasta perfection. I particularly really enjoyed the orecchiette, the pasta was perfectly al-dente; the porcini mushroom sauce fragrant n tasty blends so well with the parma ham. The tagliatelle was very good too. Very authentic bolognese sauce very fresh n definitely homemade feel. Me and my friends enjoyed the seafood casserole as well. The decor of the restaurant is very cosy n warm. I felt like i was eating in Italy and not in Singapore. Highly recommended restaurant!
4
This restaurant is very underrated. It isn't as well known as some of the other restaurants, but the quality of the food is much better. Burrata is fantastic, so is the lobster linguini that is off the menu. Sometimes I do takeout and they offer wine on the house while I wait. Excellent service and has outdoor seating which is dog-friendly. Highly recommend for a relaxed dinner with friends, family or date.
4
In Italy has managed to combine the people and food focus well enough to make you feel genuinely welcome in a spacious environment as well as to feed you really well all this with humility. Their wine list is generous and affordable.
4
Lovely atmosphere. Very attentive staff. Nice wines and quality food. Chef went out of his way to accommodate our request.
5
Unforgettable ossobuco ravioli pairing with chianti de la maison ...and unconventional expolsion of taste , tenderloin in demi glace with porcini paired with sudtiroler gewurztraminer.
Bravo master, you are the best ambassador of italian tastes in Singapore.
5
This is our nth time in this restaurant but it's our first time to try the Bistecca, which was simply delightful. A big chunk of soft, juicy, succulent Angus, roasted to perfection, melt-in-your mouth texture; paired with the smoothest polenta and the tastiest peperonata we've ever had -- heaven! The last time we had Bistecca this good was in Florence! The tagliatelle bolognese ragu is our favorite -- simple yet rich in flavor. The burrata with prosciutto was firm, creamy and delicious. Without doubt, this restaurant uses only the freshest and best ingredients. Service was prompt, efficient and not intrusive. Not an inexpensive place but it's worth every penny
5
my wife and have been here with our friends couple. 2 of us are italian and even if i'm very difficult to be satisfied when i eat italian food outside my country this place is a very pleasant exception.the food is so genuine and good. you can taste the touch of a very experienced chef with all his talent mixed with the tradition... perfect match!
5
It's always good to find a proper Italian restaurant that not only sports the name but actually deliver what is supposed to: original country food. This restaurant is a good discovery in Singapore. Few dishes rather than many means the chef can concentrate on what he cooks best.Not cheap but it's Singapore
4
I enjoyed my lunch here. I love it's squid ink risotto with soft shell crab, the highlight of my lunch. Must also mentioned the bread with green source to go with. I did not know what made up of the green source but it was a match
5
Have you been in Italy, or better to the Lombardia? Perhaps visited the old town of Bergamo and sampled the real Italian northern cuisine? This is Restaurant is reflecting the tastes perfectly. A bastion of impressive cuisine. This is a restaurant for people who understand Italian food and not acquired it by reading a smart book. It is intelligent food cooked to perfection. Basta. Chic, stylish, consistent service and staff and Chef owner Mario understands his profession. A Burrata straight imported from heaven (weekly :-)), a Minestrone with fresh ingredients and cooked come a la nonna, Prosecco Panna Cotta simply a pleasure. We don't count anymore how often we have been here. Its just time and again one of the best Italian Restaurant in Asia

I discovered this restaurant last night (Sat 11th Jan), it looked great from the outside so we decided we'd eat here. I'll preface this review by saying that the food was ok (4/5) but the real issue with this place is that it has the worst service I've received at a restaurant of this price range in Singapore.From the moment we walked in the front door the bad service began:1. The first waiter outside and I made eye contact and I gestured for a table for 2, he looked away and kept walking2. So I then proceeded towards a large Italian gentleman with a beard who I assume is the Manager/Host, again gesturing for a table for 2 and he worse than the first waiter looked me up and down and then walked off leaving us standing around table-less 3. Finally seated by a lovely and helpful lady the hunting game for a waiter began again 4. The Manager/Host looked over when we were ready to order and I gestured for someone to take our order, and he totally ignored me again and just walked offOverall what could have been a good night was ruined by the SINGLE WORST SERVICE experience in Singapore over the last few years of living here
5
Last night we had one of the most delicious Italian dinners yet in Singapore (and believe me as Italians living in Singapore we have looked). We are from Verona and my husband is a great cook in his own right, so it takes a lot to impress him. The gorgeous burrata did just that as did the acqua pazza fish dish as a main course (we shared the burrata as we ordered the special portion for two. Our good friends (who used to live in SG) were visiting from Sri Lanka so we were very pleased with our choice for them as well since they loved it! They had the fois gras which melted in your mouth and the acqua pazza. The complimentary prosecco and array of small desserts offered by Chef Mario were just icing on the cake. We will be back!
5
We shared the burrata to start and was impressed with the portion. I'm still dreaming about their white truffle risotto from their special truffle menu! My partner had the ossobuco ravioli and it was delicious.
3
We had wine, carpaccio, wagyu beef, spring chicken, dessert. Good menu selection and combination , so we reckon well experienced and knowledgeable Chef. Good portioning and size. If anything to change or better, would be service efficiency, otherwise all OK.
5
We were introduced to Mario through friends and he really looked after us. The service was matched by fantastic food - fresh of amazing provenance and great taste. Loved every minute of it.
4
Heard alot of rave reviews about their authentic Italian fare for quite a while now but only managed to try their food recently (a surprise dinner date from my partner!) as it's hard to get a seat if you walk in without a reservation.The dÃ©cor within the restaurant has a rustic feel with its rough walls and leather booth seats an option to the higher bar stool table top option. The menu boasts a wide choice of delicious, comforting dishes elevated by simple ingredients presented in an appetizing manner. We took a while to take our pick as there were just too many choices! Verdict:- Filleto - Medium well done steak was seasoned to perfection and was so soft that it almost melted in my mouth. Loved the sauce so much that I used my last bit of steak to mop up every drop of the sauce. Of course, Morton's Steakhouse wins hands down but the Fileto comes in at a close 2nd/3rd place, in my book. The dish comes with mashed risotto (or so I think) and that didn't quite suit my tastebuds; a little bland for me.- Minstrone Soup - Soup was home-cooked and the ingredients were finely chopped and were very fresh. Overall, the taste is bland for me but loved the fact that it is home-cooked.- Rocket Salad - Thinly shredded cheese were sprinkled all over the salad and tossed in light vinegrette. Provided an excellent balance to the meat dish I had. Love it.Expect simple Italian classics here but make sure you make a reservation in advance to avoid disappointment
5
Large table dinner with business guests. 13 seated, many appetizers. Everyone enjoyed their meals, the gnocchi with balsamic drizzle was spectacular. We struggled a bit with the wines, finding good Italian wine was a bit of an effort. Ask for help, because once the bottle is open, it's yours. Chef Mario really shines in interacting with the guests. We were the last table in the restaurant, and he came out and treated us to Stollen and grappa to mark the beginning of the holiday season, sharing toasts and stories with us. The Grappa is his own blend, and he stores it in an oak barrel which gives it a slight golden tone. Really tasty
5
Had dinner there last Tuesday. The food was excellent and what I consider to be pretty authentic Italian food. Only strange / odd thing about the place was the selection of music that they were playing. First off it was a little too loud and secondly it did not suit the ambiance of the venue. Will definitely be back there again
5
Normally I don't write review in TripAdvisor even if I follow.But this time it's different, I'm Italian and in inItaly restaurant I found the great combination of real Italian quality with unbelievable delicacy.Really thanks to Chef Mario Caramella to gift to me this high quality momen
5
A fabulous night. We decided to finish our visit to singapore by selecting an Italian restaurant recommended by the trip advisors reviews. It tooks us an hour to reach the restaurant by bus. When we arrived no tables available, asked if we would like to sit at the table bench. This proved to be a winning seating arrangement for us. When we order our drinks it came with free cheese. After we finished our meal Mario asked us how we enjoyed our meal and we told him it was delicious and the wine matched the meal. He told us it was his own wine and then poured us another glass on the house. We order a souffle and Mario was still talking to us and told the waiter to bring another dessert for us while we were waiting, this was also on the house. Talking to Mario he has bought a property in Queensland and if he opens a restaurant there we will certainly travel from Sydney to once again enjoy his fantastic food and hospitality. Thanks Mario for a wonderful last night in Singapore
5
Mario has kept the menu small but it really packs a punch. Have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed. Black squid pasta is rich and full of flavor, tuna is perfectly cooked, rocket salad fresh and light. Love the cosy atmosphere inside and prefer to sit at the high tables in the middle of the restaurant. We have introduced many friends to In Italy and none have been disappointed. Staff always friendly and Mario always engaged and looks after us well. Great selection of unusual Italian wines as well
5
Chef Mario and his team went over and above in all aspects of our dining. We loved it so much last time, we returned again on our recent visit to Singapore and loved it even more. We left the entire selection to Mario for our dinner for us and our guests.. Each dish was superb as was the wine labels we washed it down with... Cannot recommend it highly enough. If you only have one night in Singapore, treat yourself, you will be delighted, as we were
4
Had a great dinner, excellent starter of Stracciatella on eggplant caponata followed by pasta and delectable Tiramisu. The atmosphere was vibrant along with warm and attentive service. Overall a great evening!
3
Out of all the dishes the Singaporeana was good. All the tomato sauce were way too sweet.
They are not used to getting children.
Won't be coming back in a hurry.
4
One of the first Italian restaurants we tried in Singapore and this was my fourth time back.Good service. Al dente pasta and fantastic Burata with Parma ham.We brought our Italian friends here and they loved it. It's never been completely full when we've been an I don't know why. Perhaps. Hidden gem. We'll be back
4
We visited in Italy this weekend for an early Sunday dinner. The restaurant was empty but the place still had an ambiance about it. The staff continued to be very attentive as the restaurant filled and were quick and efficient with the orders/drinks.The menu is varied, from pastas to meats and the food well executed. Usual Spore prices for a decent Italian restaurant and was definitely worth the trip.Recommended
5
We came here in a group of eight, the table was set, so we could all see and talk to each other very cool indeed. We were recommended a Barolo from Chef Mario's personal collection, very smooth indeed. A variety of dishes we shared, from pastas to sea bass, and then we had to wait a while for the finale, the 1.2 steak, which was one of the best pieces of meat we have all agreed to have tasted!Another bottle of Barolo and we were set fro the shuttle home!Good service, and great food, makes this restaurant a gem. Will go again with girlfriend for special occasion
3
Reasonable value to visit at lunch for the 2 course limited choice menu. I opted for the soup and a pasta, both of which were good without being great. At the price I certainly can't complain. Service was enthusiastic but a little slow, which was perhaps our own fault for not requesting slightly faster than normal service upon arrival
4
I came here with my colleagues for our lunch. There weren't many people at the restaurant so the ambience was lovely. We ordered the two course lunch menu and were very impressed with the quality of the food. In particular, the clams and mussels (from different dishes ) was fresh. My minestrone soup was one of the best I've ever tried. Overall, I would say that the serving portions they give are very generous.we were pleased with the service too and we were rather delighted to be offered a piece of chocolate and tart each as a complimentary after-meal treat.
5
Time to write a second review about this Restaurant. Since our last entry, many visits from us have followed and we happily report consistency in food and quality. This is the type of food we drove down for from Switzerland to the Lombardia on a regular basis when living in Europe - just to enjoy good and authentic Italian cuisine. Last night we had yet another round of good food and wine, well prepared and reasonably priced. Portions are generous. We had Prosciutto con Melone, Burrata Cheese (to share - huge entrÃ©e portion) and probably the best tomatoes in town - perfect! Our three pasta dishes as a main were tasty, al dente as they should be and they even went out of their way to create a vegan version for me. Dessert - just great. Service can be a huge challenge for business owners in Singapore lately. We had a very competent Philippine lady as a waiter who acted "in charge" and very professional to the extend, that she "covered" other staff still in a "learning curve". We felt really well looked after and no problems like we recently experienced in other places. So all in all, a great place. The only thing we would enjoy is perhaps some good homemade Grissini in the nice bread basket for a change. But perhaps I am old fashioned or simply nostalgic
1
Visited the restaurant as a leaving dinner for someone in my team. We were greeted warmly and the restaurant interior looked nice. We ordered some beers and a shandy for one of our party. In error they brought shandys for the whole table. No problem I thought and raised it to the nearest member of staff who also appeared to be the restaurant manager who responded 'well I don't know what you ordered' 'but you do work here don't you' I responded 'yes I do but I have no idea what you ordered'. I have never experienced such a terrible attitude in a restaurant over a totally simple query around a wrong drink order. The correct drinks arrived but we were waiting for one final drink which was a juice. I told the same guy which juice it was and he replied 'I need to get someone who understands your English', I'm a native British English speaker. Rude and totally unnecessary. I was left feeling very uncomfortable in front of my team but did not want to make a scene. Finally I have a nut allergy and informed our server as we placed our order. She bought us one dish and informed us it had nuts in it, we asked couldn't you make one without nuts and she said yes we could, do you want another one? No! Why didn't you do it in the first place. Overall an awful dining experience, I would never go back and a shame really for the chef because the food was not that bad
5
Superb honest authentic Italian food which is some of the best I have had, great quality, perfectly prepared and seasoned, I cannot get enough of the food here and will continue to enjoy this restaurant hopefully for a long time to come, you must also enjoy the Caramella selection wines on offer which are fantastic value for money, keep it up Mario
5
great authentic Italian flavour!!! Menu updates regularly to entice my hunger for the best. 2 thumbs up!!!
5
I m from Europe, I tasted many italian restaurants... In singapore I already tasted 3 italian restaurants and this one is great. I love squid ink pasta, in this restaurant it is delicious (the squid ink pasta I had in other places were not that good). Compared to other italian restaurants the price is reasonable. The rose souffle is perfect.People working there are smiley and professional. The chef is italian 
2
I went there for lunch today, food was good although my husband pasta was way too salty, my was ok.The waitress was very kind and helpful the problem was an Italian man that is the manager or owner as he was not wearing uniforms like the others. Since the moment I enter to the restaurant the called my boy a "crying boy" he he told it to me 3 times and when my husband arrive he said "your wife and your crying boy are waiting for you". I think this is completely out of place especially when my boy was not crying!!! Even is he would it is just out of place.2 hours after our lunch we both have diarrhea....
5
We went to In Italy with a group of friends before christmas, we all enjoyed fantastic food, great wine and good company. The special truffle menu had some excellent options as did the main menu. Everyone enjoyed their meal and it is definitely a restaurant in Singapore which i would recommend to others, and one of the few which understand good customer servic
5
I had a fabulous Eel Risotto that was made with a beet and red berry sauce. It was truly yummy. My nephew had Sea Bass that was fresh and seasoned perfectly. They served ice water with the meal and kept the glasses full all the time. We had asparagus as a side dish which was excellent. It is great that they had side vegetables. I highly recommend this restaurant
3
Some friends chose this last week and as we had never heard of it, good or bad, we went along with the suggestion. We sat outside, lucky it has been quite (by SG standards) cool of late and perused the menus. I was struck by the limited range, although there were specials that the lass tried to explain, but it was clear she had not a clue what she was talking about. In the end we made our choices: I had the ravioli with oxtail ragu and saffron cream sauce as a starter and the roast spring chicken as a main. Some of my ravioli were a bit too chewy, perhaps they had stuck to the pan? But otherwise the dish was fine and a nice sauce. The chicken was good, properly seasoned and needed no extra salt from me so I was impressed with that - I guess the place must be quite new as it hasn't had the usual complaints that the food is too "saltish". The wine list was pretty reasonable with a range from affordable on my salary to eye-watering, and I went for a couple of bin-end choices which were both more than drinkable and under $100 so that was good. Overall though I was just not blown away by it, the service was a bit hit and miss and I wasn't taken by being stuck outside despite a reservation and when I went in for the loo realising the interior tables were empty - an earlier reviewer commented on this too and I think it may be right, they fill up the terrace first so it looks busy. There are many Italian restaurants here so to stand out they need to be really good, and I am just not sure about this place
4
Me and my fiance visited this place it was easy to find and a nice setout. It was odd we were asked if we had a booking (seeing there was 4 free tables inside) we said no and were made to sit out the front , which was fine it was a nice night. We did notice in the hour or so we were there they made most the people sit out the front and left 4 + tables inside free? Maybe to make it look busier from the st ? We ordered food and drinks the pickled vegetables were great nice and tasty, my partner ordered the prawn chilli garlic oil pasta that was really nice. I did find a hair in my meal and they took it serious and gave me a free beer and another meal which was good as sometimes those things happen. Overall a great experience and worth it great prices too

Dined here as group of 5 adults and 1 toddler for early Christmas gathering.Unusual and good assortment of breads before our orders (all for sharing) arrived.Couscous and raw tuna - refreshing passionfruit dressing and mix of texturesBolognese pasta - pasta tasted like they were freshly made. plain looking sauce was actually very good! we slurped everything upVeal ravioli - the filling's texture was similar to foie gras. meaty/ herby sauce went well with itCalamari - fresh squid cooked to crispy chewiness. we liked the tangy dip very muchRoasted chicken - meat was well seasoned and moist. we loved the roasted vegetables too!Passionfruit souffle - fluffy delight!Ambience - warm but not too dark lighting and setting. there were just as many groups of couples as there were of friends Price - almost S$40/pax after a credit card discount (no alcohol was ordered)Thanks to staff who not only gave good service but were also kind and patient to our toddler. We all had an awesome time in your restuarantI learnt that they dont open for Saturday lunch

I was over at InItaly in early December after a recommendation from a food-loving friend who swore on the establishment's quality food and reasonable pricing, a rarity in restaurant-saturated Singapore.Upon entering the restaurant, you can immediately sense that the warm, homely decor was carefully thought out by someone who is most definitely Italian (I later found out that Chef Mario runs the place), and the promise of freshly sliced parma ham highlighted by the bright-red meat slicer near the entrance. Of the many dishes we had that night, the ones that stood out were the Boston lobster salad, whose lobster possessed a uniquely succulent texture - the lobsters are apparently shucked whole with water pressure? - and cuttlefish ink risotto prepared al dente to retain a certain crumbly texture. All in all, a must-try for everyon

I had a last minute arrangement with a client and decided to take them to In Italy. I had been recommended this place by others for its food and service... I was not disappointed!Luckily I managed to get in without a reservation, as it was later in the evening when we arrived. When you walk in late to some places, you get the stare from the staff, like they are not interested... not here... we were greeted warmly and taken to a nice table. Got seated and instantly felt relaxed in the comfortable and vibrant surroundings. The place was fairly busy and had a mix of customers from business professional to casual groups, to intimate duos.The food was spectacular. I had a holiday in Italy early this year and the food served here was authentic Italian cuisine, prepared to perfection.Service was great, which is so often a let down in Singapore. Here service was efficient, without rushing, came with a smile and matched the awesome quality of the food presented to us.We enjoyed a bottle of great Italian wine that complimented the entrÃ©e and mains we had. Once we had finished, we settled the bill and were then offered a complimentary glass each of wine as a night cap by Mario, the owner and chef. It was already late, but it just shows the friendly atmosphere by the owner and staff, that they were not rushing us out the door.I am happy to recommend In Italy and will return for sure

Service and surroundings were perfect but food a bit borring and dissapointing. Although, it is a place I would take clients again as previous visits have been much better.
5
Great quality food, good ambience. Great service too - they gave me a nice birthday cake! Highly recommended. Try the foie gras risotto and the squid ink pasta.
5
Incredible food, impeccable service and an amazingly comfortable atmosphere. Chef Mario and his team made this so much more than just a dinner, they made it a culinary experience. Definitely a must if you are in Singapore. Bravo e grazie!
5
Very nice place with delicious foods, good service. We will surely come back to this restaurant again...;)))
5
I was invited to inItaly 2 weeks ago. They have good service, very delicious food. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends.
5
We ate for just over 200 dollars, three courseS, nice bottle of organic barbera, and coffee. It was fantastic. The meat was extraordinarily tender. The service was excellent. This is a brilliant restaurant and we'll be back again and again.
4
I was there with my wife sometimes, because we work nearby, but only for lunch. We always choose the set lunch, which is a very good choice. It changes every now and then and always has been good.
Very recommendable.
4
Yes, except for the calamari which tasted ordinary (dipping sauce is nice thou)...our squid ink pasta, aglio olio, roast chicken, chocolate fondant are all delicious treats. Service is somewhat patchy (hope it is an isolated case), we ordered one chicken but came two & one of our pasta dishes took quite a while to arrive.I would return to try its other courses.Price is approx. $50 without drinks
5
Mario and his team have created a very special place to eat and enjoy the pleasure of Italian food! On every occasion the staff go out of their way to make our dining experience an absolute pleasure! We return again and again bringing visitors to Singapore who compare this amazing restaurant to one of the best they have experienced. We totally agree! Thanks for the energy you all give to make this restaurant one of our favourites in Singapore! Love your work guys

Chef Mario's food is definitely worth splashing out for - his flavoursome, carefully sourced and well conceived dishes are genuinely reminiscent of a trattoria. Service is always top class too, even when they're busy, and it's good to see Chef Mario chatting to customers (though we're not sure why he avoided our table - perhaps a preference for monied regulars?) The outside area is lovely, but would really benefit from being fully non-smoking as smoke has a habit of billowing across on the balmy evening breeze and spoiling the delicious fare. The atmosphere inside would also benefit from the aircon being set somewhere above freezing; and subtler lighting. All in all though, highly recommended if you fancy treating yourself

Loved the simplicity of the food. Authentic and refreshing.
Must try is the white truffle cheese soufflé and also the squid ink pasta!
4
Sitting outdoors meant we were in a more cosy setting, without the echoing salon. The menu is original and stands out against all other Italian in Singapore. The neighbourhood is very nice too.
5
I come here with my friends for our annual “girls’ night”. It’s a cozy place to hang out. The Italian menu was great for us to enjoy our night breaking the daily diet. My friend told me that it would have been better if we can sit outdoor, but the haze didn't allow us to. Anyhow, the service was great, so we had a lot of fun that night
5
I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to indulge a full italian dining experience. Food was top class, completely stunning and great value for your money. Service was slightly slow due to peak dining hour, but the waiters are truly attentive and put personal touch on their service. I spent exactly 207 sing$ for 2 persons, complete apps to desserts.
5
Great Italian, low key but chic vibe and helpful staff - it's a total win. There are tons of Italian restaurants in Sing, but this is definitely one of the best. If you can handle the Singapore humidity, sit outside on the patio (they'll turn on the fans for you) and just relax with a glass of wine. About 5 minutes walk to Chinatown, so if you're visiting or have guests, can do the tourist thing then reward yourself with some delish food.Try the prosciutto apps - if you're into prosciutto you'll be in heaven
5
...but in a good way. You will not find your 'standard' Italian fare here, instead an interesting, varied and intriguing menu. The owner, Mario, was very generous, welcoming & interesting to talk to and very passionate about food and flavours. We very much enjoyed our first visit, but with family who live in Singapore this was, for them, another welcome return. When we return to Singapore we'll be booking another table.

2013/09/19I went to inItaly with my wife for anniversary.20 minutes after order, Appetizers came finally.20 minutes after appetizers finished, Pasta came finally.According to owner, kitchen is small. it takes time for keeping good quality.Orecchiette(pasta) was very hard and chewy.3 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 pasta, 1 dessert, costed about 160SGD.I would not go anymore
3
We came to this place because it had great reviews on this site. Unfortunately we were disappointed.The food is good but overpriced and the portions are small. 26$ for a small plate if pasta... I'm not a big eater but really I was still hungry when I left!To bad because the restaurant has a great potential
5
First visit there was on Valentine's day with my wife. We foolishly decided not to make dinner reservations and take a walk around the area for a restaurant after being turned away for the umpteenth time, came across in ITALY. Though the place was packed, and despite us not having any reservations, Chef Mario kindly arranged seating for us. We had just came back from a trip to Italy and was hoping to revisit the wonderful tastes we experienced during our stay there (having an Italian chef definitely raised our expectations). The food when served was exceptional and experienced wonderful service from the staff.Since then, we have been back quite frequently, seeing its just a 10 minute walk from home. We have also brought along family and friends on some of our visits and everyone has left impressed.In a nutshell, its beautifully honest food without any pretentiousness, as close as you can get to an Italian meal without leaving Singapore. I'm just grateful to be slightly more blessed that most to have in ITALY at my backyard.Enjoy and be in good health always

I'd been here once before and had an amazing meal, lovely rose, and a very attentive owner who recommended some brilliant dishes, so I decided to revisit in my birthday. A big disappointment. I had rung the week before to talk about the wine id serve, and he said he would provide birthday cake as well, so I didn't bring my own. I booked a table for 9.It was like we had never spoken. He sat outside talking to friends, his waiters knew nothing, my friends were kept waiingg, i didnt feel special at all, and the piece de resistance was the cake when brought out, was a tiny 4 cm slice of chocolate cake with a sparkler on it, ludicrous. Nine people drinking lots of wine, dropped a lot of cash that night, I never went back. Dangerous inconsistency considering the competition the restaurant faces in Singapore
4
I don’t like going abroad and eat Italian food, but sometimes you have to please your friends. I had lunch in this restaurant without great expectations but at the end I blamed myself for my bias. The food is really good, typical and well-finished. No fake Italian style menu. The ambience is cozy and informal. Of course importing food from Italy makes the bill a little pricey, but you won’t pay more than in any other good restaurant in Singapore
5
What a brilliant experience. Authentic and delicious. We tried the lobster gnocci (with more lobster than gnocci) and the seared tuna for lunch. Nice service, and as we were sat at the bar a fun conversation with the owner.A very different experience to the usual good-but-not-great Italian food in Singapore. May they keep up the good work
5
ok this is my third review of this restaurant , i am very surprised by some of the negative comments. My wife and I have only ever had great service from Chef Mario and his fantastic staff. We always feel like we are returning friends, such is the welcome.There are places in Singapore which sell Italian food for less but the point here, is the quality of the ingredients and the overall experience. You can go to Pastamania if you want but it will not compare in the slightest. For food of this quality I think In Italia is cheaper than the competition.My one problem is that the Tagliatelle is SO good I have never been able to go here and not order it. As a result I often "roll" barrell like out of the restaurant from over eating
4
We went to In Italy with my husband on Friday night because we heard so much of this place so we decided to try. The food was quite good and we could see the chef working which was very nice to see.For apetizer i had a ruccola salad (very very good) but my husband took a specialty of the day which was a seabass carpaccio. It came with quite a strange tomato sauce so he didn’t really like it. And for the main again my choice was by far better as I took Pollo Diavola. It was a generous portion of a very well cocked chicken with great flavor with roast potatoes, sweet shallots and tomatoes. Unfortunately I had share it with my husband as his Duck with pistachio sauce was not really good. It was quite chewy and the combination with pistachio didn’t work well. Overall I believe it’s a good restaurant but this time we as a couple have quite a mixed feelings that might not allow us to rush back
2
We made a reservation for inside table of 4, when we arrived we were told our table was outside (hot and humid) I reminded waiter that we had booked an inside table, he told me he would get the manager. The Grumpy Italian - told us they were busy and other wanted inside tables so we should sit outside, I protested again and he gave us an inside table mumbling irritably to himself as he walked off. Basically this encounter spoiled our dinner, everything seemed slow and uncoordinated from then on plus the menu hasn't changed in months. Don't think we will go bac
5
My Italian husband and I go to In Italy about twice a month. We have had great service, great food and been welcomed by everyone who works there. Owner & Chef Mario loves what he does and it shows in all aspects of the expereince. My favourite is the fresh tuna with gremolata - can't get enough of it. We have tried all the pastas - all excellent and the burrata is also a show stopper. The Duck confit and chicken are both excellent and the best I've had. They also offer an excellent complimentary bread basket with fresh pesto style dip to start - which adds to an already great eating experience.Chef Mario has kept the menu small and focuses on producing only the best food using the freshest produce. We have sent all of our friends there and they also haven't been disappointed
5
At best, some restaurants are just giving you what you pay for.In Italy is all about passion. Primarily from the Chef Mario but also from his Second and the whole team too.And when passion is sometime boring to the one who is not on the same page, sharing it around a true authentic and product oriented cuisine is just what makes life better.We went 4 times to In Italy and it was each time a perfect renewed discovery and good time shared with the team and our friends.I will not go to an exhaustive list of what we eat; the best is for you to go. But once I had the special main course of the day: just stunning! Stuffed quail topped with foie gras - an absolute.Excellent products, true and honest cuisine, engaging and passionated Chef and team.To me, the BEST ITALIAN RESTAURANT IN SINGAPORE.Congratulation and keep going
5
Chose this on recommendation of a friend who really knows the Singapore restaurant scene well (and against the preferences of my wife who usually finds Italian food to much the same). Suffice to say that from making the original reservation when I received a personal call to confirm my online reservation details, until we finally left past midnight, everything was excellent.We had an outside table for 4 in a discrete corner but service was consistently attentive and very friendly. We opted for the daily specials which were all superb,even the modest burrata was light,tasty and beautifully plated. The spaghetti with tuna and raisins was also a pleasant surprise being equally light and tasty without the cloying heavy buttery texture common to so many of Singapore's Italian 4/5 star restaurants. The house white was very good too,so much so that we stuck with it instead of ordering from the excellent wine list albeit consuming 3 bottles! Chef Mario Caramella spent a good 15 minutes chatting to us at the end of the meal and clearly imposes his tastes and preferences on in Italy and all the better for it. Even my wife was won over.Overall an excellent experience and we will certainly go back
1
i booked at table for 10 on Aug 11 specifically mentioned its to celebrate my mother's birthday. When we arrived, we were shown to a curved counter table with high bar stools. I have asked the waiter(who later confirmed with me he was the manager) why they gave a table which can seat no more than 6 person comfortably(its a birthday dinner celebration..not a happy hour light meal) and without telling us during reservation that its bar stools. My mother is almost 80 years old and there is no way she could sit comfortably. The answer was cold and clinical: the restaurant was full, without any further explanation( its the attitude!!). We had no choice but to leave...without even a word of apology from the manager. Prior to this bad experience, I have been to the restaurant twice in the past month and enjoyed the food so I thought would be a great experience to bring my mother and family there to spend a special evening. I would strongly recommend the owner/chef to look into this and do something about it, before more goodwill and customers are lost

Just happened to be in Singapore few days after the chef of this restaurant was classified in the second place in the Barilla's competition, which is an international competition organized by the biggest pasta producer (Barilla). As one of my friend here in HK was one of the judges there, he was telling me about this chef running this restaurant in Singapore.........so....deal !Me and my Singaporean GF went there fort dinner and have to confirm that the food was at the top level and , have also to say that it was not just a matter of food but of the Italian hospitality in the real term of the word . Restaurant is nice, the service was always there even if the placed was packed, and chef Mario was a real host, very gentle and always available for a chat or for a query about how to cook this or that...........His pasta dish , the one winning the silver medal , was sublime and we are still thinking at it from time to time. Definitely a place where to go again once back in Singapore! Grazie Mario 
3
We came with great expectations and left unsatisfied with the quality of food and service. Place is nice but bit costly for the not so great experience.....!!! :(
5
We celebrated my wife's birthday in the restauarant. We were a group of 16 but were looked after superbly.
The waiting staff were helpful and attentive and the food and wine delicious.
5
The white asparagus was simply awesome and I am so happy to see this restaurant going from strength to strength with superb consistency and authenticity in all areas, excellent Mario, keep it coming!!! My daughter loved bolognaise!!!
5
After hearing many good things about this place and the history of the Chef owner, we finally managed to make it for a nice family dinner (2 adults, 2 teenagers and 2 children.we were offered the high table in the middle between pillars.Service was friendly and accommodating...all with the perfect smile and genuine.We ordered some starters to share . Simple dishes but perfectly executed. from Calamaris to frog legs from burata to parma ham. The fried bread is a nice touch.the oxtail ravioli and corstini are great .Best is the owner Chef who can give you the insights with a personal touchfound finally a place I can come back to in Singapore cheers and thanks for a nice family night out
3
Was there for a team lunch from work. Nice, quaint part of the neighborhood off Tanjong Pagar. Service was rather good, more so from the chef-owner, who made some delightful recommendations including his special of the dayManager recommended a bottle of their house pouring wine which went down easily and great with the savory food.Affordable set lunches, great ambience, amicable chef with great food to warm the soul makes this place worth a visit for lunch
5
This was my third time at In Italy in as many months, and once again it didn't disappoint! Staff were attentive and friendly and the busy lunchtime crowd made for a buzzing atmosphere. I opted for the two course "Italian Lunch" set menu (three courses really if you include the complementary bread with salsa verde), excellent value at $24++. My meal was nothing short of delicious. The dish of the day for me was the excellent Farfalle with Robbiola di Roccaverano Cheese and Balsamic Syrup. The silky sauce paired with the sweet balsamic syrup was nothing short of amazing. Had I not been in a restaurant I would have licked my plate !! The desert trio that rounded off my meal was faultless, I would have been happy with any one of the desserts in the trio. In Italy is proving to be one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore and with many more dishes for me to try, I know I'll be back
5
On a recent visit to Singapore we visited this restaurant and what a very pleasant surprise it was.We lived in Singapore for fourteen years up to 2005 and good Italian style food then was always hard to find and very expensive. If only Mario Caramella had been there in those times as he has done a magnificent job of combining quality food with reasonable prices.On Mario’s recommendation we tried a variety of dishes and they were all extremely well prepared and presented and very tasty as well. The Florentine steak was excellent and I’m not a big steak lover. We thought the restaurant had been very tastefully decorated and the staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about the items on the menu. In short it was a totally enjoyable night out and we are looking forward to visiting again when we get to Singapore
4
Some of the best Italian food I've had, not only in Singapore but also in Melbourne, Aus.Delicious food and well designed space.Sadly, let down by the very ordinary coffee and poor sommelier suggestions
4
decided to drop by today after hearing about it on the radio... couldnt think of any other place to go and boy were we glad... we arrived a little after 7 and the place was starting to get packed...due to the haze, we decided to sit inside... well lit room, not too cold... only thing was the music.. doesn't really suit the restaurant.. (Top of the Pop??) LOL...nevertheless, we ordered the Fritto Misto (Fried Calamari, Shrimp and Softshell crab), give it about 7.5/10.. the balsamic and honey mustard sauce a special.. not bad overallWe then ordered the Pollo alla Diavola and Squid Ink Tonnarella for mains... basically the grilled spring chicken and Squid Ink Pasta.. the 2 dishes really made our day, and temporary made us forget about the awful haze clouding over Singapore. The Chicken was juicy, tender and so well marinated... while the Squid Ink was Al Dente, and the sauce went extremely well with the pasta...Overall was money well spent as the bill was just a little over $100.Would definitely come back to this restaurant... a great find
3
I passed by this restaurant en route to a Japanese restaurant which turned out to be closed on a Sunday, so came back because the menu looked interesting. The food was okay, though they turned out to be out of the main dish I wanted (chicken) and they told me that the acqua pazza I ordered would not have mussels and clams as advertised on the menu but prawns, which was fine, except that no prawns ended up appearing. The waiter seemed bewildered by everything I said and had no interest in taking a drink order
5
I went to this restaurant based on Tripadvisor review and friend's coincidental recommendation. The food were amazing. I ordered Soft Cheese and Parma Ham for my entree, and squid ink pasta for my main course. As the entree came with a big portion which could be shared with two to three persons, it would be wise not to over-order entree unless you have brought a number of friends to join you for this dinner feast. The entree was great with peeled and sliced fresh cherry tomatoes as topping for the soft cheese and Parma ham. It blended well with each other, refreshing and appetizing. The parma ham was served with great quality and it did not come with fishy smell. The squid ink pasta was said to be the famous dish in the restaurant according to the waitress and thus I ordered and tried. The pasta was stirred cooked with young asparagus shoots and prawns. It did not taste that tomatoish but rather it let you have a taste of greenery because of the asparagus shoot. Overall it was okay because the prawns they used were not fresh so it was a little disappointment I have.My friend ordered one entree and one main course as well. The bill we got in total is 185sgd. Honestly, I did not expect it to be that expensive. Having said that, given that the entree was really delicious and came with a big portion, and also the entree could be more or as expensive as the main course, I think it explains why the bill was so high. My advice for the visitors, bring more friends to join you for the dinner so that you can get to try different dishes and spread the cost

My husband and I went to InItaly a week ago. When we arrived it was really busy, unfortunately this meant that the service took a hit. When the waitress came over to take our order, she told us about the seafood appetiser which we chose. Unfortunately, as we were not offered any bread, it took us nearly an hour from sitting down until our starters arrived. Our starter arrived, and they were nice, but unfortunately all 3 fish/seafood which were included in the starter were smothered in the same sauce, which meant it was a bit difficult to distinguish any taste difference between the prawn, tuna and seabass. Our main arrived more quickly than the starter, so much so that my starter plate had not been cleared, and we had not been given any cutlery.My lobster tomato risotto was good, however, my husband's bolognese was pretty bland, and was a small portion. We had a coffee and a couple of scoops of ice-cream after our mains. On receiving the bill, we were pretty astounded to see that two starters and mains, bottle of (house) wine, one scoop of ice-cream and one coffee came to over S$320!!!!! Now, I admit that virtually EVERYTHING in Singapore is expensive, but this seemed ridiculous given that our main courses were $18 and S$38 each. It turns out that, although the waitress didn't tell us (and admittedly we didn't think to ask, because, it would seem reasonable that you should be able to establish how much a starter will be from the price of the other items in that course/menu), the starters were S$48 EACH. That's THREE TIMES the price of the bolognese MAIN on the menu. For a STARTER. the waiter, although admittedly it was not his fault, was less than receptive to our dissatisfaction. The owner, (chef patron Mario) who had previously been more than happy to swan around speaking to everyone, caught our eye and despite our asking the wait staff to ask him to speak to us about it, refused to come out to discuss it with us. Either the staff didn't pass it on, in which case there needs to be more training, or, Mario didn't care to deal with negative feedback. Either way, there are far more deserving restaurants in Singapore to spend over S$320, and we certainly won't be back
5
Fantastic little restaurant; very nice outdoor space and impressive bar. I did seat at the bar for dinner and I did immediately enjoyed watching the chef preparing the appetizers on the back of the bar.Got some parma ham with truffle honey and the bread with cheese, it was fantastically washed down with a glass of prosecco. The tuna cus cus salad was refreshing, the cold tomato "ice ream" was superb.As main we got a risotto with white asparagus and a bollito misto: AMAZING!Rice was cooked the correct way (al dente) like you get it in Italy, it was balanced' not too creamy, just perfect.The bollito misto is a must!! Difficult to find in Italy, I was shocked to find it in Singapore. Suprb quality, presentation and taste. The green sauce and the mostarda are fabulous. Overall a great dinner in a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere with a great Chef and nice and friendly service. I will definitely get back to this restaurant during my next visit to Singapore.

I managed to sneak a seat at the bar on a Saturday night when the place was booked solid. The staff were very friendly and I was presented with a dish of the most delicious cheese to enjoy with my wine before I ordered. Gorgeous squid ink pasta and great atmosphere, although a rather limited menu. Great wines
5
We were recommended by Trip Advisor as InITALY is rated the top 4 of 2359 restaurants in Singapore. For Italian inITALY is No.1. We started with the Parma ham burrata cheese and it was really nice.For the mains we had the Beef cheek, and Lobster spaghetti, and boy were they delicious. I really love my lobster spaghetti, it is the best I have tasted in Singapore.For dessert we shared a lovely Chocolate Fondant. Our food was paired well with the wine recommended, and only later did we learn that they were Chef Mario Caramella's private label wine "Caramella Selection".Chef Mario called on us to check on how we found his food even though this was our first visit to the restaurant.All in all, it was an excellent dinner in a lovely restaurant
3
The ambience was not bad but if you think to have personal talk, this is not the place. The table is too long and put us quite a distance when we were sitting face to face. Waiters were standing too close and I felt no privacy. We ordered squid ink tonnarelli for me which I quite like it although it was a bit too salty. My husband ordered gran bollito because he read good review but the portion was quite small. Because he was still hungry, so we ordered the thin pizza, Crostino. It's just so-so for me but it looked healthy with the black olives paste. Chef Mario came out to greet his guests which shows a good sign of a professional chef
3
I was recommended by the staff to order "the white asparagus risotto" which was supposed to be the special of the day. But honestly, it's nothing special.. It's just 2 sticks of white asparagus with risotto.. And it cost $32. Ad the risotto is too hard.. had to reheat it to soften the rice.. TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT. Order the mushroom sides too ($16) and its not worth the price too.. Taste normal. The starter bread (flat crispy bread) is good though. With the green colour dip. Service is great though. They smile, get you what you want in time. And its Enjoyable to see happy smiling staff serving. But it's just the recommendation (asparagus risotto) that didn't turn out well. Not gonna go back because of the risotto.
3
We went with high expectations and left slightly disappointed. The restaurant was busy but the service was slow and mixed with the feeling of being served by a trainee!! Staff were friendly although we ended up paying at the till after waiting so long for our plates to be cleared for all 3 courses. The menu has some good starters although the mains aren't great for veggies or non meat eaters. We had the clams and mussels which were tiny and many were grainy as they'd not been washed properly. Probably won't return as many better places
5
Very authentic food, fabulous service, what more could you ask for? I had the pasta with porcini mushrooms and pancetta which was delicious and only 22 sd. I also couldnt resist the fondant for desert which was super.. As was the ricotta cheesecake my friend had. Highly recommended.
5
My friends and I have enjoyed several ladies lunches at this fantastic restaurant since it's opening last year. The location is perfect with parking across the road and the staff are always friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. The food on all occasions is just delightful, the portion sizes are perfect and the flavours are great. Today I enjoyed the usual complimentary basket of breads, a very yummy tomato soup and a risotto which was just sublime! The lemoncello souffle was the perfect way to end the meal - very light and fluffy and just delicious. I would highly recommend this fabulous restaurant, as the food, service and ambiance have never faulted on the many occasions that I have visited it! I'm already looking forward to my next visit
5
Les plats qui y sont servis sont tout simplement géniaux (coup de <3 pour le Crostino, les raviolis de pomme de terre, le Grande Bollito).We've been here at least more than 10 times now and every time we're impressed by the level of cuisine. Every single meal is just perfectly balanced and perfectly cooked.Trust me, if you are in Singapore it is a place to go
5
My boyfriend and I visited inItaly for dinner based on the tripadvisor reviews, and it certainly didn't disappoint! Down a quiet road, we had a lovely seat outside. The staff were friendly and attentive all night, and were smiling which you don't see all that often in Singapore! Also the head chef came and spoke to us a few times and explained our starters, which was so nice to see him front of house. The food - amazing. My boyfriend had the veal ravioli which he said is the best he's ever had, and I had the orecchiette Witt porcini mushrooms and crispy ham. Had to have a dessert as well, and I had the formaggio selection which was fantastic! Great wine list, we went with a lovely prosecco to wash everything down. We will definitely be going back when we need another Italian food fix
5
So I booked this place for me and a few of my friends based on it being numero uno on tripadvisor and boy did this place not disappoint me.we ended up ordering quite a lot of dishes and every single one did justice to In Italy being as famous within Singapore expats as it is at the moment.Starting with classic tortellini soup, and the breads that they placed in front of us, the place set a very high expectation of the food to come.And my own main Baked Lasagne did it whole justice.We also ordered Gnocci, Grand Bollito and a risotto, each brilliantly made and an absdolute delight to taste.I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great Italian meal. (don't forget to make reservations though
5
My friend and I had an amazing lunch at in Italy today. The lovely atmosphere and modern decor help you forget what is happening in the real world for a little while. Service is fast and efficient, just what you want when time is limited. Owner, Mario, is hands on and happy to offer recommendations and have a quick chat. We chose the set lunch option, which was delicious. My seafood risotto was perfectly cooked with just the right amount of clams, squid and fish. I enjoyed every bite! And the Limoncello Soufle' is to die for! Added bonus of a public carpark directly across the road. Can't fault in Italy on this visit, looking forward to taking my family for dinner some time soon
5
Reservations were easily made and though we were told that we were to be seated outside, we were given a seat inside since it was available.Service was great without being trying. It was as comfortable as I am in my friend's home.Food was great.Lobster risotto was creamy without being cloying and it was so good that my daughter wanted another portion and she is 8. Unbiased taste budsI enjoyed the black ink squid as it was fresh and tasted as good as it gets. Smoky hints with accents of the herbs showing through.My carnivorous son actually enjoyed the vegetarian lasagne . Texture was just right and the plum tomatoes had its acidity showing through with the beautiful clean taste of italian basil.The tuna steak was a tad overcooked but I must give credit to the sauce that helped salvage the dish.Our favorite was the burrata mozzarella .the clean taste if the herbs and the nutty flavours of the olive oil complemented the creamy cheese and the sweet tomatoes. It's is extremely good value for the large portion and great flavor. The key here is the food is fresh and the kitchen takes pride in preparing its cuisine. It is nice as the passion does show through.i am getting jaded by outlets complaining about increasing costs of operations n cutting back on the quality and process in food preparation.I think in general most people are happy to pay reasonably if there is passion and pride in serving food. A lot of outlets forget that food is to nourish the body and soul and good food does affect one's mood and well being.Overall I enjoyed the food, ambience and service tremendously. A little miss once in a while cant be faulted. I will definitely return very soon

We had a great time in Italy tonight. Mario is a very kind owner, he welcomed us warmly and took care of us. We loved the place, we ate outside, it was not too hot and the Moretti cold beer helped us. We ate stracciatella with aubergines, fantastic, cappelletti in brodo, handmade as well as my ravioli di ossobuco, never tasted cooked in such a way, divine.At the end value for price, we spent 75 dollars for that and we were very satisfied.

This review is slightly overdue. I’ve been to In Italy a few times now, and have enjoyed each and every experience.First time was by accident. It was the first day of the Chinese New Year, so a lot of restaurants were closed, hubby and myself were around the tanjong pagar area, saw In Italy open and thought, why not. Well, here’s the deal –I was kind of wary because of the restaurant’s name (No offense, Mario!), but perhaps I should have taken the simplicity and honesty of the name as a reflection of the wonderful experience I was about to have.Anyhow, the restaurant was packed, but we were lucky to get a table – it was a relatively cool night so sitting outside was actually even nicer, with the pitter patter of the slight drizzle against the awnings adding a very European feel to the whole place.The menu isn’t a laundry list of Italian favourites, instead, it seems almost a carefully curated menu of the chef’s favourites. We saw options that rarely could be found at other restaurants in Singapore, so that was a great reason to try something out of the ordinary.We started with the Crostino, definitely a winner, with smooth Taleggio cheese and prosciutto draped all over it. The portion is great, it’s almost like having an entire pizza. Had the Ravioli Ossobucco after, and loved the way the saffron just gently graced the dish, the veal too very delicious encased within the ravioli. Most recently, I was there for my birthday, a rowdy bunch of food and wine lovers. Well, the food was brilliant as always, this time as there were more people, we tried the Beef Fiorentina, and yes – the 1.5kg hulk of a beef was perfectly charred on the outside, pink on the inside. Another awesome experience was my b’day tipple – a 3L Magnum of the smoothest, velvety yet rich Amarone that we had. Perfect complement to the food. And on the occasion of my b’day, I was presented with a beautiful platter of cakes and treats to celebrate.Definitely one of my favourite Italian restaurants here, and looking forward to my next visit

The restaurant"s decor, it's food and it's people transports you back to beautiful Italy! Chef Mario is a delightfully gracious host with his remarkable Italian hospitality. Coupled with his young and vivacious Chef de Cuisine Felix. In Italy's food Reminisces of the bold and full bodied traditional Italian homemade fare cooked with love. The squid ink pasta was to die for, the texture of the squid ink pasta was just right. The squid ink smell was not overwhelming but was light to the palette. Fused with a aromatic creamy tomato base and a hint of light spiciness. Best squid ink pasta I had !!!! Chef Felix had convinced me to try the dish I had a bad experience in many Italian restaurants - squid ink pasta. Now I'm a convert!!! We had a great time, great food and great hospitality! Will definitely be back for more

Finally - some decent Italian fare at reasonable prices in Singapore - food is not overly complicated - thank you Chef! Delicious salads, appetizers antipasto, pastas and sauce accompanied by decent wines made for an entertaining evening with good food and great friends. We shall return very soon - to sample other items on their menu. Ask for table at the rear of restaurant for a group dinner

I was brought to in Italy in April for my birthday celebrations and I have to say I was very impressed. Singapore is renowned for its culturally diverse cuisines and Italian restaurants are surprisingly good here. We went on a Monday evening and there was still a good atmosphere inside. There is seating outside if you want to tackle the Singaporean humidity! Starter and main courses were generous and the staff had a very good knowledge of the food and wine being served. I finished off with the cheese plate for desert, which was enough for two/three people. To top it all off they brought out a birthday desert and sang happy birthday to me! A great evening all round and I will be back in the near future
5
Food is always fantastic. Service is attentive and friendly. Given all this, the prices are fantastic!
5
Mario prepares no nonsense authentic Italian fare in this well appointed restaurant with warm service and value for money. In short a great concept! I will be sure to return for my Italian fix.
5
My 6th visit to this restaurant. On a weekdays is relatively packed with customers.This visit I specially invited a good friend from overseas and was really happy to say that the dinner was as good as ever. Although is the 5th visit i never had once had a same appetizer or main apart from the beer bread; is just taste awesome. Overall the dining experience was up to expectation and will definitely have many more visit to come

This was our second visit to In Italy. The first time was great and we wanted to see if this was consistent. We were not disappointed. From the moment we walked in and took our table, it was obvious we were in for a memorable experience, yet again. Such a warm welcome from Chef Mario and the staff, who had remembered from our last visit. Remarkable.Chef Mario recommended a bottle of Pino Grigo Zano which pefectly matched our food of Crudo di Pesci the special starter of Sashimi style Sea Bass, Tuna and Prawn (beautiful by the way!) followed by Sufato di Manzo (Beef Cheek) and Lobster Risotto... The food was not only beautifully presented but really exquisite. We were very well looked after throughout our meal including very generous glasses of a Strega like liquour...My partner and I were definitely very happy. This was a fabulous second visit and we most definitely will be going back. PS Beware the bread basket, dangerous in its deliciousness!
5
Italian food as you get only in fine Italian restaurant.Do not miss "Cous Cous alla Trapanese" with raw tuna, "Spaghettini Freddi" with sea urchin, "Pollo alla Diavola" roasted with rosemary and potatoes, "Stufato di Manzo" stewed beef cheek with porcini and polenta.I did not feel tasting any dessert but finish with a chill glass of Italian Sparkling Moscato.The welcome bread, food, drink, atmosphere and Chef Mario supervising the restaurant made an excellent experience as you would get in Italy

Known the chef since the days when he was in Forlino and therefore my expectation was pretty high to start with. My first visit was with a group of European wine merchants and an Italian wine maker. Perhaps of the language or the Italian ambience, it helped to relax everyone and enjoy the evening. The second visit was months after and I made an online reservation one and half months in advance for my significant other's birthday dinner. On the day I was very pleased that the request for private corner and reservation for a bottle of Italian wine was duly followed. Something that most restaurants would disregard in view of space constraint and desire to make the profit from the wine as soon as possible. The restaurant was packed on the day. Manager and chef were seen entertaining guests as they stepped in and made seasonal recommendations based on customers preference. Menu items were clear and concise with a good selection of Italian wines to choose from. Dishes here are prepared in traditional style which generally equates to simplicity and naturally authentic. This differs from most people impression of spaghetti with all the sauce, meat balls and etc. Pasta here are as plain as possible, coupled with side dishes if you desire.Like all other restaurants that strive to serve using the best ingredients, In Italy prices are a little on the high side but not over the edge. Ideal for diners who enjoy the ambience of a cosy Italian trattoria, and want something different for an occasion. Will definitely go back again
5
The food was absolutely fantastic!Everything we ordered was superb, the prices were so reasonable and the staff were very attentive. It's a casual atmosphere with 5 star quality food. You certainly should visit this restaurant, I was extremely happy that a colleague of mine recommended this venue to me
2
We went there because of the high rank on trip advisor, we ordered the anchovy bruscetta (poor out of the can quality), for main courses we had the ravioli that had a too dominant orange zest souce, and a stewed beef with polenta, was very good except the polenta that was more like a corn based mashed potatoes than any polenta we ever had. The owner came and asked how was our dinner, he was too busy explaining why we shouldn't have ordered what we ordered, which was kinda funny, cause we asked for recommendations.. Didn't try the desserts. Last comment - the toilet stank terribl

Decided on a whim to have Italian and stumbled upon this place on the internet. Managed to get a table outside which was pleasantly nice and cool. Found the food really good with reasonable pricing. We shared the Fritto Misto which was crispy and light and conchigliette with crispy Parma ham and porcini mushrooms. It was delicious. Service was good so i'll definitely return
3
A great chillout place with your pals for a nice meal and to have a drink too. It's a pity that the dishes were mostly 'meaty'. I'd rate it better if it had a few more selection of seafood or dishes with more vegetables (besides the salad)
4
Good authentic italian food. Atmosphere is noisy as it is crowded. Good for chillout and dinner with friends. It has silly and unreasonable corkage policies. Hope they change those.
3
Based on TA reviews I went on Valentines day. I like the atmosphere. Rustic but buzzing. Food was mediocre. Calamari was chewy, salad slightly bland, decent sausage main course, and pasta was again, ok. I expected much better based on reviews. There are better places.
5
Did not expect much when i visted this italian restarant. Overall it is authentic, staff are friendly and ambience is nice. Is a casual dining place not some fine dining restaurant but food is fine dining standards.
4
The food quality and price of this restaurant is very good. There is a nice seleciton of wines and after dinner drinks. Apart from the Bistecca, all of the meals on offer were well priced for the quality offered.To note, make sure that you state you would like to rest between courses, our main meals arrived at the table before we had finished eating the entree... Keeping that in mind, I would eat here again
5
Excellent food that is authentic Italian which is prepared with passion and paired with superb wine that oozes value for money in a warm and friendly rustic Italian environment that is true to some of the best restaurants you would find in Italy, a truly authentic concept and experience! Bravo
4
Went there on Friday after hearing raving reviews from friends. Didnt disappoint one bit. Best raviolli I had - The sauce was amazing with a very subtle hint of lemon zest and saffron! Couldn't resist trying my friends' food and they were great too! Mario and his team were such wonderful hosts - a sumptuous way to end a crazy work week in the warmth of their hospitality! Will definitely go back
5
After reading the reviews for In Italy, I decided to book in for Valentine's dinner for myself and my wife. We were seated outside on the front patio at a high table which was comfortable and gave us plenty of space to spread out. The food was excellent and an absolute highlight was the Stracciatella cheese which came with caponata that was divine.Good friendly service and chef Mario came round and seemed to give a personal word to all the diners. Based on my experience of eating in Italy this sort of Trattoria is the heart and soul of Italian dining - good unfussy menu, well sourced wine and usually family run. Bravo

Why do some people have overwhelming expectations about listings here. This is Singapore, not Shanghai - you will not find white tableclothes, bespoke service and pasta hand-made by firstborn virgins at this price range. And I refuse to put blame on a restaurant beyond its control that are solely ie taxi availability, poor research and sheer ignorance of Italian wines. Having said that - I was not wowed away by this establishment. The wine list was disappointingly short with no affordable options. I was puzzled how a magnum of Barbera would be more affordable than a regular Nebbiolo. The food was ok and arrived in small portions. My beef cheek was still quite chewy but my companion's lobster special was stunning. The special of parma ham and buffalo mozzarella was outstanding. This is one of the better Italian options I've had at this price range but at this price I would have gone to Ricciotti at the Riverwalk for the views or Buko Nero for one of the best insider experiences if you could get a table

Went to this place guided by the tripadvisor App in my phone. I was duly impressed by the 50+ reviews giving it a 4.5 average rating. Reality was stubbornly at odds with the ratings, and I really wonder sometimes how ratings happen.-Dining room is cold. Cheap decoration. No table cloths. Menu on paper place setting. Very poor lighting makes things look even sadder.-Wine list: Only italian wines (this is not necessarily bad in itself, on the contrary but read on), no explanation on the wine or the grapes, no year for the wine. When asked waiter for a recommendation on wine, he just pointed at the most expensive items on the list.-Food: Middle of the road. We shared a thin pizza-style focaccia as a starter. Nothing to call home about. I had gnocchi with some italian cheese and modena vinegar as a main course. Unispiring and a very small portion.-Service: Very detached. We needed a taxi to go back to our hotel. They could not get one on the phone (pre-Chinese New Year period, which I can understand). Owner suggested that we took the subway back to our hotel.....On leaving the place, I realized this place is SO close to Oso, which is probably one of the best Italian tables in Singapore. I was so mad / sad to have missed an opportunity to go back to Oso

IN ITALY is most certainly worth a visit. If I lived in Singapore, I would be dining at the restaurant very often. The food is as authentic Italian as it gets at affordable prices, complimented by great service and a lovely atmosphere. The Restaurant Owner, Mario Caramella is an outstanding personality who will make a point of talking to all of his guests and make them feel as if you were at his house for a meal! I can go on forever about how good the restaurant is but it's best you try yourself and become a big fan like I am :
5
Just excellent food and wine. The owner/chef has a number of significant achievements under his belt and this shows through in the food, service and ambience. The spicy chicken dish was to die for! Highly recommended.
5
a real Italian in Singapore, wines of his own cellar imported directly from Italy with his label. Wow. I suggest you ask check Caramella and let him guide you with the day special. Blindfolded.
5
We were warmly welcomed by the friendly owner, Mario to this little Italian restaurant. The menu was small however the entrees and mains tried were delicious, it was good value for money and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
4
When i stepped in the restaurant, i was served by friendly greetings from the staff. Unlike some restaurants, this restaurant is very different, its the homely feeling that makes the experience different. We sat day from 7.30pm till 11pm, both me and my friend just wish we could continue to chill around that place.We started off with the Stracchiatella Cheese. Honestly, i am not fond of vegetables, nor i am fond of egg plants. But it was recommended by the chef. I gave it a try, and surprisingly it wasn't what i had expected it to taste like. The tomatoes and spices gave me a very refreshing taste! Secondly, i had the squid ink tonnarelli, and my friend had the ravioli. I would prefer mine over my friend's dish. The squid ink pasta is their signature dish, whereby it has this very asian taste in a italian creation. On my next visit, i will definitely order this! A MUST TRY DISH!Had the chocolate cake, and it wasn't any normal chocolate cake. You can find surprise inside, NUTS! who could have thought off. Instead of having just the chocolate, you could find something to complement it and chew on it!And with thanks to Chef Felix Chong, he gave us a complimentary dessert - squid ink macaroons. Yes, sounds very weird. I dont like macaroons as well, cause the flavours don't really suits my likings. but in this, the fillings are very refreshing. I thought of buying back, but it wasn't for sale. So, i will go definitely go back again to eat that complimentary macaroons
5
We have spend two days in Singapore and I knew Mario from the previous restaurant (Forlino), I knew he has moved and open IN ITALY and we decide to try it out as we were very happy from his food and service at Forlino. I can say it was even better this time. The restaurant is cozy and casual with a warm atmosphere. Good service and excellent food, nice wine list and the prices are not expensive for Singapore. Defiantly excellent value for money. IN ITALY it is exactly what the name say, it is like sitting in a good restaurant in any city in Italy, Mario does not believe in fusion and only the traditional, high quality products are used for the preparation. I highly recommend IN ITALY when you travel to Singapore. Well done Mario and see you again soon

I had dinner in this restaurant after looking for Italian restaurants in tripadvisor. I came there with high expectations. After the dinner I was really happy of the food and service. The starters were really good. I took, prosciutto Parma with some siders. As main course I had a really nice fresh pasta with amazing funghi porcini (just arrived fresh from Italy by plane!!!). I also had a really nice steamed beef with polenta, which was fairly good. Each dish was introduced to me by the Italian Chef (probably the chef was happy that I was italian having dinner there) who was really fun welcoming all the people arriving in the restaurant and from time to time making sure that I was enjoying my food, asking for feedback.The price is not low but absolutely worth it. Starterts, main course, second course and 3 glass of wine were around 140 singapore dollars. I definitely reccomend it to all italians in Singapore and also to everyone that wants to tast real italian food and not the crappy junk food you may find in the various tourist traps all around the world
5
been there few times now...i think the best way to review a place is to go there at least 3 times. in here i've been 4 or 5 now. always a great experience, food is absolutely traditional italian and the service is attentive. the chef is the well know mario caramella, a guarantee! everything is made in the real way, they make the bollito (mix boiled meat) and the cotechino (pork leg cooked salami) and i think they are the only ones in town. talk to chef caramella is always a pleasure so with his right-hand felix chong. the ambience is good, elegant and homey at the same time. reasonable price, wine list also good and with very honest price. there is not only sassicaia from italy and this selection is very well done (I'm a wine lover).so, if you want to try real italian food give them a chance (even 2), if you are looking for american or asian style "italian" food (crazy things like pineapple on pizza or carbonara with cream, pasta alfredo and all those insults for italian kitchen) maybe this is not the place for you. keep it real as it is
2
I had to double-check that I tried the same restaurant that I'm reviewing. Frankly, I'm not sure why this place is rated so high here. The food was about as a good as I'd expect from a college cafeteria. Perhaps its because we opted for the "Italian Lunch" set. The soup was bland. It had some "ravioli" like thing which was tasteless. Although we had asked for the pasta to be a few notches more undercooked than "al dente," it was mushy. The taste of the sauce lacked depth almost like straight from the jar, except without the tangy taste, and the combination of flavors was frankly just awkward. The dessert was overwhelmingly sweet.I was expecting a good lunch after reading the reviews here. It was so awful that I will unlikely be going back to give it another shot
5
Based on Trip advisors' reviews we attend to this place with all the family. To our consideration the food was great and the service too. Despite some others have commented to the small size of the portions, for us these were perfect. The ambience was perfect, not too snob, not too casual, we find a perfect spot to set up the family and we observed that other's were perfectly enjoying with their friends... Maybe a little bit pricy but the whole experience worth it
4
Food wise (and I love Italian food) it's authentic and unusual. Had the prosciutto di parma and crostino.and for pasta the ravioli di brasato. All excellent. I just felt the portion of ravioli was a bit small but ithe chianti sauce was light and was brilliant I felt. When the Crostino came, the waiter offered to cut it up for us (we were a group of 5) and then the chef (owner if I'm not wrong) came out and cut it at our table all the while telling us normally the kitchen does not cut pizza up and that is the case because there are knives and forks at our table (aka we could do it ourselves and we would have but the waiter offered to do it!) that was the only kind of off-colour thing of the lunch. The desserts.. ah.. were not fantastic.There ran out of cheesecake (we were only one of 3 dining parties there.. guess they ran out from the night before). But dessert was a little disappointing. But i would go back again.. I like the pasta
5
If you feel like having real italian food from a renowned chef or just feel like having chicken...i would recommend this place.Nothing is stiff here, everyone smiles and service staff treats you with sincerity,I had a delicious spring chicken dish that is generous in portion and comes with tasty vegetables.LOVE I
5
I reserved a table at the restaurant for lunch at very short notice (the morning of the reservation date in fact) and, a little optimistically, asked if they could do something special because we are celebrating my wife’s birthday, although I had no real expectations of anything given my late booking. On arrival at the restaurant, we were given a table outside, as requested, and ordered from the set lunch menu which arrived promptly and was remarkably good. Later the bill arrived followed by a lovely surprise of a birthday cake with my wife’s name piped in chocolate around the edge of the plate accompanied by a number of the restaurant staff who joined together to sing happy birthday to her both in English and Italian.What can I say? It seems a rare thing to get that level of attentive service and I am truly impressed
5
I visited for lunch without a booking and had a great experiance. Menu was not over done with good honest food with all employees being able to explain everything. You will not find your standard dishes from an Italian restaurant, which was refreashing to try something new but with flavours which were clearly from Italy.Great to see the chef coming out to say hello and see how everything is, not something you see everyday.Overall had a great lunch with friends at a great price, will go back next time l am in Singapore

Being ranked #1 on tripadvisor, I was keen to try out In Italy. Tried to make a dinner reservation for 3 on a Wednesday night but was told it was fully booked. Fully booked on a weekday - made me want to try this place out all the more. Booking well in advance, went for dinner on a Saturday night. Ambiance was nice, leaning slightly more towards the casual side. Started on a high: The bread basket with pesto-like dipping sauce was fantastic. Ordered the burrata cheese (~$48+) which was one of their specials, was also great! However things started going downhill from here: the mains were nothing special - I had the squid ink pasta, which I felt was lacking flavour whilst my partner had the beef ravioli, again nothing to rave about. Overall sharing an appetizer, 2 mains and a bottle of wine came to approx $200. Am I in a rush to book again? No. Personally there are better Italian restaurants out there
5
It is "food for the soul and stomach" that a Restaurant which just recently opened has managed to already work as a well oiled organization, both in service and quality of food. Cheerfull staff when taking reservation, very obliging when we had to postpone the arrival time..right through when we paid the bill (very modest in pricing). Ambiente nice, manageable in size, cozy setting, not over the top but stylish, food presentation and quality very, very good and good size portion. Friends went the night before and experienced equally good qualities and reflecting same impression. Keep it up please. We hope to experience the same again at our next visit, coming up soon

My husband & I went to In Italy in Craig Rd and were very disappointed. Their website looked attractive with an interesting menu. The website offered a promotion of BYO +1, one for you and one for the chef. Be warned of this deal that if the chef is not happy with the wine you bring for him he will rudely come out to your table and let you know, following a hefty corkage fee.The food was average. The waiters were attentive. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with the chef's poor manners and his average food.I would suggest to go a few doors down to Pasta Brava who excel themselves with fine service, good prices and excellent authentic food....not to mention the owner who takes pride in chatting to his guests with complimentary limencello
3
Average at best , all formula too simple .. not much to make you come back except location might be good ....Chef need to put his passion before his wallet and give us some "too die for dishes " ..he is not alone this is actually true at an epidemic level in Singapor
5
Was brought to In Italy by my godbrother for my bdae celebration. The ambience of the restaurant really lives up to its name. I felt like I was in Italy. You could tell how much attention was given to their set up and decos. and the food? one word. AWESOME! I had the stracciatella cheese with sweet and sour eggplant for appetiser. I'm not really a cheese nor an eggplant lover but this, I thought was a superb combination. & I had squid ink tonnarelli with prawn, brocolini and botargaas my main dish. If you think this pasta sounds disgusting, wait till you taste it! It is not a blank ink spaghetti as you may have thought. It's really amazing how when it enters your mouth, the smell and taste of the squid was just right. & no...no black ink dirtying your teeth. My favourite part was the dessert! Definitely! If you're a chocolate lover, try this, chocolate fondant with passion fruit coolis. Not only was the food great, the service was too! The servers took the trouble to ensure all was well with our dinner. & the chef who prepared our menu that night, Felix Chong came over to us for a chit chat towards the end of our dinner. Thank you Felix for a great food prepared that night and your great company. Very very satisfying with the food & service. Definitely will come again and highly recommended. Thumbs up to the management and staff of In Italy
4
This place is very new (3 months old) but I think this restaurant deserves a thumb’s up. The lobster pasta of the day was simply gorgeous! Service was great too. When it was clear that we were sharing the dishes, they took the initiative and served our pasta in two plates. For desserts, the manager recommended the chocolate lava cake but we opted for another dessert instead. To our surprise, a complimentary chocolate lava cake was served along with the dessert we’ve ordered. And of course the cake was yummy
5
Our party dined on a Saturday night and delighted with both the authenticity and quality of the food. From antipasto such as prosciutto with truffle honey, artichokes, and roasted onions ($S18) and slow cooked tuna with cannelloni beans and red onion ($S16) to main courses including beef ravioli in a Chianti sauce ($S18) and spicy sautéed mussels and clams with crusty bread ($S12) every dish is made with the finest ingredients and prepared to perfection. If you are Italian, you’d have to think back to your grandmother’s best recipes to understand just how good the food is. If you are not, you will wish you were or Italian decent after dining at In Italy. It’s just that good. Chef Mario only overseas the menu but also guides the attentive service as well. The food may be the main attraction, but Chef Mario’s charismatic and engaging personality only adds to the ambiance and authenticity
4
I need a second visit to ascertain its ranking. Veal appetiser and fish condiment with the bread were great though
5
The food was fantastic. i Took the family on a Sunday night for the first time ever and was pleasantly suprised with the warm ambiance .It was some of the best Italian i have ever eaten, even my 8 year old was commenting, mum this is the best spagetti i have ever had...The price was the most unbelievable part of the night, food of that quality is not supposed to be cheap,it was better than good value and a suprise not often seen in this day and age.The wine selection was also another big winner.We will certainly be putting this on the favorites list
5
I love the food and the amazing thing is not just that, u get impeccable quality of food in many restaurants here in Singapore, it is the price that makes it Top of my list of Italian restaurants! With such affordable prices and great quality of food, I really didn't want to let everyone know!;
5
Been here several times since it opened a few months ago. Every time I have walked away looking forward to my next visit. The service is exceptional and the food superb. The prices are so reasonable given the quality of the ingredients and the setting. Went 5 days ago and going again tonight. Try it, you want be disappointed

My family of 5 went to IN ITALY for a family dinner yesterday after reading reviews on this site. As it was my first visit to an Italian restaurant, I was worried in the beginning as to which dish to order. Alas, all my worries were unnecessary as the host Tony was very friendly and helpful in suggesting to us the various dishes for my family. The food and services were very good. My children especially enjoyed the cheese cake which was fantastic. The only thing that can be improve is the tall chair setting at my table which make consuming your meal in a very relax and comfortable position difficult. Other than that, it was a very good experience and my family will definitely come back again
5
The best restaurant experience in Singapore for many years. The food was outstanding, the stand out for me was the Lobster Risotto. However the difference between good and great is the care and comfort provided by the staff. It was one of those experiences when you start looking for the microphone under the table, every uttered wish came true. As soon as we thought or considered what would compliment or add to each moment, the staff at In Italy had already considered it. Little extras such as cheese to compliment the wine, extra Parma ham to ensure our appetiser remained appetising. The wine selection was well priced, and a perfect partner to the meal. Extraordinary experience all round, we will be back very soon
5
After the first encounter with the restaurant which is positive, I decided to return this time round with my friends for their birthday celebration. Our dinner for the night are based on the recommendations by Chef Felix. We have the t-bone as per recommended which is amazing good. My friend who do not eat eggplant actually love Stracciatella the most! The freshness of the seafood for the dish 'Fritto Misto' was welcoming. Not forgetting one of the signature dish 'squid ink tonnarelli'Not only did Chef Felix recommends good dishes to us, he did surprised the 2 birthdays girls with the signature giant macaroon. Thanks chef Felix for the wonderful evening. We will be back again
4
Myself with few friends went there for lunch recently. Some had set lunch $18 for 2 course meals and some ordered from ala carte. Though the food were tasty we all agreed the portion were rather small. We dont mind paying more and get a decent serving ( perhaps Chef Mario may consider giving option for customer to choose ) The staff were good and wine was yumm.I will come back to give another try with hubby next time
5
1. Excellent service (a)we made a book just 3 hours prior to dinner time for an extremely large group of 18pax. They had the terrace booked for us and even drafted a tasting menu within the short time span. Very responsive! (b) Tony, the floor manager displayed impeccable service standards and I mean worldclass (I've tried Tetsuya, Quay, etc so imagine the benchmark I've set). He was obviously very customer centric - refills of prosecco were smooth and timely, making sure all of us are having a ball of time. That day poured like crazy and he ensure we all have taxis booked and brolly prepared! He refused a tipping which I honestly felt he truly deserves it. 2. Food (a) al dente pasta, melt in your mouth beef cheeks, creamy risotto, savory cheese flakes are a showcase of authentic Italian cuisine (b) great for value wines (we had almost 5-6 bottles of prosecco; 3 magnums of chianti Classico?!?!?) Honestly we drank so much that I can't recall and please don't mark up your prices in time when you become too popular. Chef Mario gave us some really strong lemon liquor! Woohoo3. Ambience (a) I would have have rated this higher if not for the leaking covering at terrace (b) interior looks cozy (c) toilets are very clean. Overall still very good I had a memorable time since it was a farewell party organized for me by my colleagues and I have to thank all staff in In Italy for making my memories unforgettable

I know tripadvisor restaurant rankings beat on a different drum than say the michelin or Global Best restaurant rankings, but i had to try this tripadvisor "top 5 restaurant" to see for myself. I went there on a weekday evening, and it was almost full house, either due to some big corporate groups, or tripadvisor, or both. The initial young server was perhaps too eager, and asked if we would sparkling or still before our bums touched our seats. For starters, we tried the proscuitto, as pictured in the main picture in tripadvisor. It was ok. The bread was ok too; they served 2 kinds, and i wasn't sure which one was their famous beer bread! i just knew i preferred the softer one. I ordered the seafood risotto which was very good indeed, nice chunks of lobster/prawn, clam/mussel etc. and it isn't often one can find a seafood risotto. My friend seemed to like his lobster spaghetti as well. Overall, ok meal. nothing mindblowing. Like i said, different drum here on tripadvisor ..

We went to In Italy for a reunion with a good friend and ended up to have a fantastic evening.Aperitive was served outside while we waited for our table. Eventhough it was 9.30pm already, the place was still full. "they just don't want to leave" was Mario's comment. Later that evening I knew what he was talking about. After finishing our drinks that were served with fresh cheese flakes that melted in your mouth, we had a look at the menu but Mario ordered for us. Good decision!!We had the stracciatella, the prosciutto and a crostino. For main course the Gran Bollito, a special risotto and a duck leg, the last 2 were specialities of the chef. Needless to say that the food was very very good. The beer bread served at the beginning of the meal is, as mentioned in several reviews before mine: fantastic, light, great flavor, hot and crispy.As dessert my daughter and I shared the chocolate volcano ( I think Mario called it that): chocolate cake with melted hot chocolate inside and served with a prickly pear sorbet. Probably very bad for your diet but definitely the right choice to finish off the meal together with an espresso. Dinner was "washed" away with half a liter Chianti.All in all a great evening, great food at a very reasonable price, no wonder he is full every evening!For everyone who likes to have a great Italian experience, this is the place. Make a reservation but don't be angry if you have to wait or your favorite table is not ready yet..... as said; once inside people don't want to leave anymore.Thanks Mario!

Been in this new Italian Eatery in Craig road a few time.. loved it from day one. No frill real good hearty Italian food .no compromise no excuses.Menu is simple traditional and really good.. bollito misto is up my alley..use to have it back n Italy and its so original and so true to tradition is nearly disarming. Wine are good and cheap in comparison to other outlets no big names but small producers and good quality at affordable price. I wonder how thry do it. My last visit got tempted with a 1.2kg Fiorentina steak .....yum better than good a great main course .charred outside and perfectly rare and warm inside.. a full meal for 4 .trow in a couple of appetized and salads. 2 bottle of wine .sharing dessert and it all came to 100 bucks each.. grappa and coffe included... I mean really where else you get this much quality for the buck.. go and try it.. if you still prefer to dish out big bucks for fluff them is only your fault...this is yhe real deal .

Made reservation for my husband birthday luncheon and requested for spinach ricotta cannelloni which was not on the menu. Chef Mario gladly made it for us and it was superb. The service, food, environment and everytng was great. Chef Mario came and checked if we were happy with everything. A chef without arrogance, humble and understand the importance of great food. Thanks for making my husband birthday a wonderful experience

Tried the lunchtime prix fix menu (a bargain at S$15++). The bread basket that arrived, with their signature beer bread was a good start. The soup was good too, but the pasta was dripping in tomato sauce and was not memorable. Overall, I reserve full judgment till I have had a proper a la carte-ordered food. But the place has potential

The issue that I have with writing this review is that there is no option for rating between 'average' and 'very good'. I have erred to be generous in this instance because it seems that everyone else that has reviewed In Italy has had a significantly better experience than I did - which is not to say that we didn't enjoy our lunch, but there is no way I could honestly call this the best Italian restaurant in Singapore. And I'm wondering about the integrity of the review process in relation to this restaurant, because I have no idea how it can be ranked so highly.The menu is very casalinga, and interesting - we opted for stracciatella with caponata and the affettato for entree, and for our main courses ravioli (a little bland - and no, I don't mean 'subtle', I do mean 'bland'), and the beef cheek with polenta (the cheek was very succulent and delicious). The beer bread is as good as everyone else has said here. The zabaglione was a little thin, but the flavour was beautiful. So overall the food was very good to excellent.The wine list made for good reading, and there was a good range of Italian and other wines, many of which were under $100. The house pour extra dry prosecco was very good, and very reasonably priced at $12 per glass. Everything was served at the right temperature, and this is a huge bonusThe staff were very obliging, and showed the benefits of in house training. As is often the case in Singapore though, much of the advice offered seems indiscriminate, and inspired by commercial considerations rather than product knowledge.The much praised atmosphere was lacking on the day we arrived for lunch - I'm inclined to blame the online booking service In Sing for this, because when I tried to book online for Sunday lunch, the option wasn't available, so I had to resort to a phone booking. I have no idea how many potential diners they lost due to this failure of In Sing - but there was only one other table of 4 during our visit. Finding oneself sitting in an empty restaurant is not conducive to an enjoyable visit - and I suspect that this is why I am a little grudging about awarding a rating of 'very good'. We'll definitely give it another try, but even on its best day, I don't think In Italy is a valid alternative to Italian meccas like Oso - then again, it's half the price. So, great for a casual meal, not up there for a special occasion. We spent $350 for 2

I've been around Italy to try authentic Italian dishes and I've been trying to find something similar in Singapore but to no avail...until I stumbled upon IN ITALY.When I first arrived during dinner time, the restaurant manager is all smiles as he opens the door for me and welcomed me in. Servers are knowledgable with the dishes as i enquire about the style of cooking and the ingredients. My water is filled up regularly as I downed it quite fast. Service is outstanding for me. Plates are cleared once I'm done.Below stated are the dishes I have ordered on my maiden visit:Beer Bread - A unique bread served with a sauce that goes well together with the bread. A good munch before the appetizer and main course arrive. ( Complementary )Prosciutto - This is my personal favorite dish! It taste so good and authentic that it makes me feel like i'm in Italy. Generous serving too with tomatos onions by the side. Tempted to order more but I have to save some space for the main course. ( $18 )Gnocchi with bolognese sauce - Hand made Gnocchi balls with bolognese sauce is mouth watering good. The meat taste so fresh that it leaves you begging for more after finishing the whole bowl. ( $18 )Chocolate Lava Cake - I was rather skeptical when the cake arrived. It looks small, but as my fork cuts through the cake and the chocolate starts oozing out and i took my first bite, it's worth it. A MUST TRY for every chocolate fan ( $12 )Overall, I can say it is a fulfilling and worth while dinner for around $50. What I notice is the chef himself is walking the ground and speaking to customers, I find it interesting to be able to interact with the chef himself.As the restaurant is usually full for dinner, I got a bar counter seat, and this punk looking chef at the bar is kind enough to strike up a conversation with me thus making my dinner even better. It gives me the family feel ambience in the restaurant. From the bar, I can personally see the punk chef ( that is what I'll call him ) preparing the appetizers. See the chef in action as he swiftly prepares every dish with precision. I must say i am impressed.This is great for business, gatherings, date, family meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone local or foreigners.P.S. They do have a special $15 lunch menu on Weekdays so you office working folks in the vicinity may wanna pop by to try some reasonably priced authentic Italian cuisine

If you're looking for authentic Italian, non pretentious food at an affordable price, this is the place to dine at!They serve authentic Italian dishes at an affordable price: $15++ for a 2 course lunch. Their a la carte menu has a price range of about $10-20, perfect for the thrifty looking for good food. The quaint shop gives you a very homely feel once you step in, it's not pretentiously furnished with lavish furniture and huge chandeliers. In fact, Chef Mario designed it himself, thus the homely Italian feel. He told us "If you see a napkin folded in a complicated way, you know the food will suck, that's why we provide paper napkins."Most of their food is homemade, from the bread to their pastas, which is what makes their food so unique and good.Their lunch set menu changes every week, so there's always a reason to go back

First time been to the restaurant with my friends to celebrate birthday for her. The atmosphere is great! When I told one of the staff that is my friend's birthday. He informed the kitchen and they gave us a nice birthday cake complimentary and we ordered a bottle of Italian sparking wine and it was great!! The price is also very reasonable. I will be back again

We made a reservation for 6pm and arrived at 5:50. When we walked in the door we were told the restaurant doesn't open until 6pm and we would have to wait outside (in the heat) until they opened, even though the staff appeared to just be standing around.The menu is very small, but prices are very good for Singapore! Most entrees were in the S$15-20 range. They had a 1.5KG T-Bone steak on special for $230!. Which is extremely expensive in my opinion.They have an extensive wine cellar (room), and the owner is on the floor talking to people. The staff did a very good job until it got very busy around 730p (make a reservation), it was hard to get someone's attention to give us our check.The atmosphere is great and the dress is smart causal. I would feel uncomfortable in shorts.Overall it's a great Italian place in Singapore. Though Etna on East Coast Road has better food, staff and a much bigger menu for similar price. The best Italian place in Singapore is Ristorante Da Valentino (they've recently changed locations) but it's very expensive. Plan on spending a minimum of S$50-75 per person

Was having a weekday dinner with my friends as we were having cravings for Italian food and saw the reviews from Tripadvisor.We started to feel the warm service from the restaurant from the point of making dinner reservation ... the warmth and friendliness from Chef Mario and he even bothered to call on the very day to re-confirm reservation.When I reached the restaurant on a Monday night at 7pm, I was shocked to see that the restaurant was almost full! And I'm truly surprised and WOW by the decor of the restaurant! It's serving main courses at less than $25 mostly but the decor is 6-7 stars!Service was warm and attentive - both from the chef and the service crew. Food was REALLY DAMN GOOD! The pasta was cooked Al Dente and the sauce was out of this world! I've always find pasta to be common dishes but nothing is common in 'In Italy'. The pasta dishes are from Heaven! And so is the pizza! I usually don't like the pizza crust but I ate it all. Other dishes - proscuitto, fried calamari and pork sausage were good too. Frankly, I enjoyed it more than the Italian buffet at a 5-star hotel that I had 2 weeks ago.We ordered a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc too - As I'm not very familiar with Italian wine - so I asked the waiter for a floral, light White wine. His recommendation was well-liked by us.After we've ordered dessert, I was surprised by the birthday treat that was pre-arranged by my friends. The service crew served a chocolate fondant with 4 mini Macarons and a candle. On my request, another chef came to sing the Italian birthday song! In conclusion, the dining experience was like having dinner in one of your close friend's place that's posh looking but with food from friend's Mummy. Definitely a wonderful place to dine at

They serve Italian cuisine at very high quality, and extremely affordable prices . We spent an evening with friends at In Italy and had a wonderful meal. Staff are friendly and recommended some great dishes and wines.

After checking TripAdvisor, I headed to Chinatown to see what looked good. I came across In Italy, and sure enough, it looked good, tasted good, with good service, at a reasonable price. I'll be back, definitely.

Quality is so good that we have been at IItaly already 6 times since the opening 5 weeks ago. Every meal on the card is delicious and special! The zabaglione is something you may not miss!

Was there with friends last friday night. Ordered Acqua pazza/Squid ink linguine/Crostino.. The proportion are just nice especially there is beer bread before the main course are here. The beer bread is fantastic and sinfully good. Squid ink linguine is superb and there's no worries abt ugly mess left behind in the mouth after eating it cause there isn't any trace of it.Service I feel is just nice. The flow and duration of waiting are good actually. Food isnt served too fast or too slow. Will definitely make this place my regular haunt out with friends gathering and special occasion! :

Having now visited inITALY at least five times, I'm convinced that I'm addicted forever! This restaurant ticks all the box, exceed all expectations, and delivers - every time - a superb dining experience. The food is genuine Italian in every way - freshest of ingredients, simple but full of flavour, stylishly presented, and incredibly good value. The wine list is not only comprehensive, but exceptionally well priced - no mean feat in a city which is guilty of too many over-priced restaurant wine lists. Authentic Italian food & wine, warm and elegant ambience, great prices, decent service - my next five visits (and more!) won't be too far away. Thanks to Mario Caramella for gracing us with inITALY's presence

I had thought that with an Italian chef, this experience would be like those in Italy. It was not. The food and drinks were very good; but the service was awful. Although there were 4 waiters, it took 20 mins for us to get served. They really need better training. Although the food was great, the service will keep me from returnin

Went to in Italy at the weekend on the back of trip advisor reviews. They are not wrong! All our food was delicious. Italian chef mingles with the guests, service is friendly and efficient and wine selection is comprehensive. Some really nice wines at decent prices. Chef told us that his aim is to create excellent food at a reasonable price("unsingapore price" is what he said)...that's exactly what he did. Will definately go back and recommend to my friends.Total bill came to s$188 for 3, including wine which was s$88

For our last evening in Singapore we selected In Italy, on 38 Craig rd. This is a new restaurant that serves excellent Italian food. We arrived early, but the place was fully booked. The eclectic chef Mario Caramella put us up on the main counter, from where we could see our salads being prepared. On the suggestion of the very friendly staff, we tried their selection of raw fish and sea food (tuna, king fish, shrimps), tagliatelle, and their Gran Bollito, a selection of different types of meat cooked to perfection. My daughter, after two weeks of asian food of mixed quality, loved the tomato salad. We finished our dinner with ice cream and a "granita al caffÃ¨", which is just not simply shaved ice and coffee, but much more. The quality of the bollito and the granita would have been excellent in Italy, imagine in Singapore.We highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that likes good food, prepared with care, in a nice and friendly environment. Prices are also very reasonable, given the quality of the food and the service

I discovered this restaurant two weeks ago, and have been there 3 times already. I would even say it has become my favorite restaurant in Singapore. The restaurant is cozy, with a very friendly and welcoming environment. Great staff, and even greater food. They serve Italian cuisine at very high quality, and extremely affordable prices! Its as if your going to a 5* restaurant, but paying local prices!Its not just about the food though. Whenever you go, the waiters and chef Mario greet you like a friend, and treat you no different. The atmosphere really invites you stay. You can only expect the best!I can really recommend it to anyone. Whether it is for a romantic dinner, a night out with friends or family or even for a business lunch.I can only congratulate Chef Mario on his success and hope to see more restaurants opened throughout Singapore by him
