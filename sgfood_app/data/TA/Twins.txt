Tasty chicken wings, in 3 different flavors.
Good set lunch in term of value.
I only tried the chicken, not the rest of the food.

Tried this place and it had some pretty good fried chicken. The rest were alright to try. A little pricey too but good company counts.

the army stew and kimchi fried rice were good. the original 6 pieces chicken tasted bland but it was crispy and the meat was tender. the garlic cheese fries were too hard and there was no garlic taste. there was a long wait for our chicken which i think was forgotten but we were compensated with a complimentary kkanpunoki for the long wait and server apologised. service was good even though there were only two servers. overall a good and pleasant visit

We had some wings - pretty damn delicious. Also ordered the "ice cream honey beer" which was just a slightly sweetened Hite beer with frozen foam on top (think frozen Kirin), which I would not order again. They have "homemade" soju, but it seems you have to order an entire liter. I would be more tempted if they offered the soju by the glass, or smaller quantities

Another Korean restaurant in Singapore that my partner and I frequent regularly. It is not cheap for that kind of food they serve, but the food is of very good quality. The friend chicken is extremely popular, and if you're game for very spicy food, their yangmyeon friend chicken is very very good. Their soy and lemon chicken is also a hit - really nicely flavored with chives. The seafood noodle is flavourful, and another popular item on their menu. Their jajangmyeon is actually one of the best we've had in Singapore - it's not too gooey, and has a nice balance of flavor. Another must try is their kimchi fried rice.The problem though with this restaurant is that it doesn't serve banchan - which is really very un-Korean. Some pickles and kimchi to start the meal would make a huge difference, especially since the food is really not that cheap. The other problem is also the acoustics of the place. The restaurant traps noise, and if you happen to have a couple of tables with diners who are loud (or worse, drunk!), you won't even be able to hear yourself, and the noise level is maddening. On the whole a nice place to hang out if you don't mind paying a bit more for Korean street food, and if you're lucky enough to have got them on a quiet night

Tried most of the dishes my friend who recommended us the restaurant raved about. Also read the other reviews on Trip Advisor. Am disappointed. Food is not as good as some other Korean I tried in the vicinity. The homemade soju and ice cream beer was supposed to be popular....but really it's nothing that deserve such claim. The ice cream beer just had some icy foam floating on normal beer and tasted like the normal beer. The Berries homemade soju tasted like food punch. And too expensive at $30 for a small jar. Give both a miss. Only The Tokkbokki is really good.But will not revisit

This is an unpretentious casual dining place. It was recommended to us by a Korean friend and what we ate didn't disappoint. They serve up tasty fried chicken (so much better than the Korean fast food places that have sprung up in Singapore) and a variety of Korean street food and noodles. This is not a place for Korean bbq- if you want that head elsewhere.For Saturday lunch we ordered:1. Spicy Dalgangjung - delicious and deeply flavoured fried boneless chicken topped with a sticky sweet sauce and served with chewy rice cakes. This was served piping hot - definitely the star dish of our meal. If you are used to spicy Asian cuisine, this is at the lower end of spiciness.2. Kimchi pancake - we asked if they could leave out the seafood which was not a problem. The pancake was wafer thin and packed with piquant kimchee. Its less doughy than what you get in a lot of places which is a good thing.3. Sung Jae's chicken noodles - with all the heavy flavours on the menu, this is the one to order if you are looking for a lighter option. The chicken broth was delicious and the dish is served with plenty of poached chicken and vegetables. 4. Woo Jae's seafood noodles - we went with the spicy version and it was good though for those sensitive to msg, you might want to give the spicy version a miss. The decor is pretty minimum which fits in with the casual dining concept. Service was attentive and efficient.

Yeah sometimes only fried chicken will do. The Korean crispy fried chicken is excellent. This comes out piping hot, crisp but not greasy. There is a side of mayo - and it's good with and also without this addition. Great vibe - like you're in Seoul. The hard floors and bare walls make it a lot noisier than you'd expect, but this hides the music. The crowd is young, and it's a good sign that young Korean natives are tucking into their meals. I'd say that's an endorsement of genuine. Service - fast and helpful. If it wasn't got the guilt - I'd have eaten more. I'll be back - but with more people so that we can sample a wider array of food

Twenty four of us came here for lunch! They serve it pretty fast. I personally like the original fried chicken, the sweet one and kimchi pancake. The yuzu tea is also nice. They have a set lunch at 12.90 which is slightly expensive for a rice and fried chicken. We ordered seafood pancake and tofu soup too. As a korean restaurant, they don't serve free flow of kimchi and other side dishes though Overall it's quite good.

Been to this place once. Hype on this place is on their Fried Chicken. Not bad. Good place to hang out after work for a few beers and food. However, staff are little overwhelmed and a little pricey. Overall i would say its not bad.

Average food, ordered honey soy chicken which was dripping with oil... Way way too much oil.
Wabar is much better option.

There are too many Korean restaurants in the area. This is a must try. Recommended. Try the garlic soy chicken wings and the mango bingsoo as dessert.

The fried chicken was delicious, the vanilla ice cream beer was interesting but lacked the kick. If you want a kick, get the Soju! The kimchi pancake is good and so's the salad.

Twins is located in a trendier part of Chinatown, so the design of the restaurant fits right into the neighborhood--chic. It's a bit pricey for Korean food, but the flavor is good! Our group of seven shared three plates of chicken wings and each ordered noodles or another dish for our dinners. Not bad, but I think the wings are their best selling point.

Fantastic Korean Fried Chicken! I went here with a big group of 11 people - food and service was impeccable! Soy Garlic, Sweet & Spicy, and Original fried chicken were excellent. Definitely much better than some of the competitors such as 4fingers, Kko Kko Nara, Chicken up, and the list goes on! We had a really great time with the food and drinks and I can definitely recommend this place if you are a fan of korean food, especially the fried chicken

Tanjong Pagar is home to a number of Korean restaurants, so when some Korean friends asked us to join them for an authentic Korean meal, we thought we were in for something traditional. Instead, they took us to what seemed a very modern place called Twins. Our hosts picked Power Twins salad, haemul pajun and tokkbokki to start; dakganjung and yangnyum as mains; and we finished with bean powder bingsoo.The Power Twins salad (mixed salad, avocado, nuts, kiwi dressing) was a let-down and utterly forgettable – based on this representative which is the signature salad, we would suggest passing on salads here. Tokkbokki or deokbokki (rice cake and fish cake in a spicy sauce) are a traditional Korean snack sold off the pojangmacha carts on Seoul streets. Tokkbokki is one of our favourite Korean dishes and Twins served one of the best versions we’ve had (admittedly off limited experience). It was strong on chilli but tempered just a tiny bit by sweet and garlicky touches. You’re probably better off skipping it if you’re not good with spice, though. The haemul pajun (seafood pancake) was heavier on the spring onions and lighter on the batter than is common in Singapore and could easily have passed for a scallion pancake. One of us loved it but the other has got used to the Singapore version. Our Korean hosts said this was the real deal, though.Our mains were both basically fried chicken, but turned out to be very different from each other. Our hosts told us that fried chicken is a product of the economic troubles that have roiled Korea since the Asian crisis – forcibly retired and retrenched Koreans have taken to opening chicken shops (much like Singaporeans have turned to driving taxis) and intense competition has resulted in an exciting variety of fried chicken being available in Korea. Yangnyum (spicy fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce) was our favourite. The half-chicken we had was intensely spicy but the marinade had strong sweet and sour overtones. The double fried chicken has a very thin coating of batter and the meat was moist and flavoursome down to the bone. We felt good having ordered the half-chicken (rather than wings) as we could taste the difference in the flavour of the different cuts. The dakganjung (spicy boneless chicken and fried rice cake with sweet / spicy sauce) was quite different, the marinade being sweeter and more sour, with a lower spice level. Pretty good, but not in our opinion, comparable to the yangnyum.Dessert was complimentary, presumably since our hosts were regulars. The four of us shared a traditional bean powder snow bingsoo (patbingsoo), which was ample. The frozen milk dessert has apparently been around since the 13th century, but tasted refreshingly modern, particularly when topped with the extra condensed milk generously provided. Overall, we would recommend Twins, so long as one is fine with a robust, rather than a fine meal. The portions are fairly large, so a party of four is ideal, to be able to try a variety of dishes. Twins is quite noisy so it’s not the best place for a tête-à-tête or a group larger than six. Expect to spend about $30 per head, excluding drinks.(visited 9th Oct 2015

I guess you can't go really wrong when you see a number of tables occupied by Korean nationals. The fried chicken here came piping hot and crispy, with the inside oh so moist and juicy. Salad on the other hand was nothing to rave about. The staff who served us was very polite and helpful. Downsides are they don't give enough sauce for the chicken (and sauce was not fantastic) and dressing for salad was really flat.
