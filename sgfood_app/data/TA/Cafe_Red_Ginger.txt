We regularly visit Red Ginger and have always had excellent food, can especially recommend Tom Yam Fried Rice, freshly made, spicy and a very sizable portion. Extremely good value for money, comfortable seating and friendly service.

Had craving for Curry Fish Head and chanced upon this place for a late dinner.
The curry is flavorful without being too spicy.
The set at $19.90 comes with Toufu and rice. Good value.

We were at IMM Mall and when we're in a mall, we always look for the foodcourt. There were many places to choose from but Red Ginger was the busiest, so we knew it must be good. My daughter had the fried kuey teow (made to order) and I had Nasi Padang. I chose a fish dish and two vegetable dishes served with white rice. It was only S$6.20 but the food was plentiful. It was also very tasty and absolutely delicious. My daughter also said that the kuey teow was yummy. What a find

This is a small restaurant located in a corner of IMM. This is a halal restaurant and besides serving Malay dishes or food, it also serves local dishes like fried kway teow (white version), nasi lemak, laksa, mee siam, fried rice, etc...We like to go there for some Malay or local food. Our favorites are the fried kway teow and the fried rice pattaya. My friends swear by the samba chilli offered together with the fried kway teow.Apparently those dishes are cooked by this Malay chef. If he's not the one, the standard may vary. Although the cafÃ© opens early, the on-the-spot fried or cooked dishes upon ordering starts from 11 am or 12pm, on weekends or weekdays respectively. I believe that's the starting time of this chef
