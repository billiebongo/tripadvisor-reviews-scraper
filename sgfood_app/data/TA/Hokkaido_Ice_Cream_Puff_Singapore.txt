The whole shop have a good smell of puff, but is not good when I taste it. Puff is too hard (like stone) and their ice cream is not good at all.

I'm sure many singaporeans have eaten ice-cream sold from carts, sandwiched between rainbow bread. This takes a twist on the traditional, with crispy puffs sandwiching ice cream! I tried the durain flavour, but it tasted fairly ordinary. Whilst a new take, was pricey.

she really liked it. it's I've cream. it's air conditioned. there's at least one other couple in here with the boyfriend taking photos too. women seem to really enjoy it.

One of a couple of solid ice cream options in this area. The ice cream is served in a baked bread. Ice cream options include bubblegum (we had that, it was good) & chocolate. Not much seating if you are trying to escape the heat.

This place is a must go! The ice cream puffs are amazing and worth the journey to Haji lane! Extremely reasonable in price and will leave you tastebuds wanting more!

A very nice ice cream place with a twist in Haji Lane. Service was quick and ice cream was tasty. Place is air conditioned but not a lot of space to sit. Good place to get an ice cream during a hot day or for dessert after dinner if you are in the area
