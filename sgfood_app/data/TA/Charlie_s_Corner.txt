Coming here for a draught Guinness, breeze and a The Smokeys tune on a quiet week day evening.
Well done guys keep it up

Didn't eat here but had a blast a very eccentric lot of interesting blokes.
Free WiFi cool outdoor location.
A must try would return!

Super chill place, such positive vibes. Great watering hole, and amazing western comfort food. I definitely suggest ordering an ice cold beer with the bacon cheese burger.

First used Charlies over twenty five years ago. Called in there tonight. Tiger beer and fish and chips still excellent.

It‚Äôs just a well placed bar in a well placed hawker stand. If you know hawker stands you know. The staff is friendly, he service is outstanding, the ambiance is well a hawker stand. The beer is cold, the food is fresh, the view is priceless. It doesn‚Äôt matter if your winding down from Singapore or gearing up it‚Äôs a great place to relax

I first patronized this cool eatery in the 1980s when I was still in secondary school. Fast forward to the present and it‚Äôs still one of the best chill-out spots around. The selection of beers is astonishing. I always get my Aussie beer fix here. For non-alcoholic drinks, the juices are really nice. Food-wise, you have to try the chicken wings and fish and chips! The chili dog is also fab!

Was there this evening my family. Ordered the famous fish & chips & calamari. The standard of the food have not drop all these years. Food arrived within 10-12 minutes after we ordered. Presentation was nice. 2 slices of Atlantic cod, grilled tomato, corns, greens and fries. I thought it was not be enough for me. I was wrong. Very filling indeed. Worth going there after all these years.If you are planning to go there for dinner. Try to go there before 5:45pm. After 6:30pm, crowds started coming in. The dining space not huge. Plan ahead if is a big group

So I had time to kil before heading for the Guns'n'Roses concert. I headed to the Changi Village Hawker centre to grab a bite and I saw hundreds of G'n'R fans hanging there and eating and drinking. That's was I was there for, to fill up my tank before the gig!So I saw this cool place at the back side of the hawker centre and decided to check it out and have a beer. They suggested some special beer and the beer never stopped after that. Good music, lots of beer, some house special sausage, and great vibes! What else could I have asked for just before the gig! Next time I'm in Singapore I'll sure spend an afternoon here. Cool Place

Been here several times and each time seems to go down a notch.This visit was presented with "proper" restaurant prices for food to be served on a wooden platter (by default is not the best hygienic method especially for such establishment).The fish is now Atlantic cod but is not as tasty as the old fish type . The breadcrumb coating has been changed and the fries not as good. Served with a grilled tomatoe (why??) .. salad which was fresh with nice sesame sauce dressing .. and corn kernels!The calamari is average and rather chewy.. the drinks expensive and the service is ok but needs to be chased and requested.Charlies used to be fab ... now it's changed I don't believe it delivers value for money under the "new" format. I can't see a repeat visit under this style and price. The music was piped too loud .. a live band was playing about 50m away (i use the term band loosely and hope they have dau jobs) however, I do understand some people will be happy but .... as they say one can't please all the people all the time .. certainly not impressing me anylonger

We were heading over to Pulau Ubin and decided to stop at Charlie's Corner for lunch and drinks before grabbing the bumboat over. The service was great...nice selection of items on the menu (including cold beverages!)...and the food was very good for the price. We had eggs & chips and fish & chips...both of which were cooked to perfection
5
Visited for lunch and had the fish and chips. Very tasty and the beer was cold.
The vanilla milkshake was excellent. A great place to eat and cool down

Stopped off here for a cooling beer after a very hot and sweaty (but fantastic) trip to Pulau Ubin. Stayed for a while and had several more beers!
5
This is one of the perfect places on the island to chill out. Away from the hustle and bustle of the city, one could drive here to chill and relax (Or maybe even when you come back from your trekking in Pulau Ubin).

Love the food here, especially the Fish & Chips for the past 20 years....not to mention the many varieties of beers they serve. Good job CC üëçüëçüëç

The food needs improvement. Ordered fish and chips and it was over cooked. Both food ordered turned out to be over cook and has the rubbery texture. Ambiance is good. Place to hang out for a good drink and great to match with luncheon meat fries

Have been here recently a few times. They have a good selection of beers and I particularly like the buy 3, get one free pint of Guinness offer. Hence the beer price is quite reasonable. As I have only visited during a week day, it is fairly quite, and I can get a lot of reading done, whilst enjoying a good beer or 4 with a nice breeze in the air.A nice little retreat for an expat

We simply love this place for the superb service, great selections of Beers , ciders and other beverages. We were blown away by the 100 over selections of Beers from all over the world !!! We especially love the beers on tap. The freshness is so delightful on a hot day! The ambiance is very comfortable , clean and well maintained. Ventilation is good with natural breeze as well as thoughtfully installed overhead fans! The staff were really well versed with the menu, friendly and helpful. They gave honest recommendation on their types of drinks based on our preference. They asked good questions to ascertain our tastes! We had fish and chips ; I highly recommended this! The fish was so fresh & juicy .The breaded crumbs of the fish is done so perfectly well! It comes with fresh and crisp salad drizzled with vinegrette dressing & tasty buttered corns kernels. The thickly cut fries were tasty too!!! It was presented on a wooden board! Awesome presentation! This gourmet dish is really worth trying! We also had the pork chop!! It was really juicy and succulent !!! Not forgetting the spaghetti bolognese!My little girl enjoyed it so much! Portion is big ! The spaghetti is al Dante & the sauce is so tasty! They even had children cutlery ready for my girl! This place is a must visit!!! We will definitely visit Charlie's Corner again!!!Thank you for the wonderful dining experience

Haven't visited Charlie's Corner for the past few years and decided to drop by last weekend. The friendly atmosphere that I'm familiar with for the past 20 years or so remains the same. Good food at affordable prices. The Lamb Chop is GREAT! Just grab a beer and chill out. Nice luck for me to get free live music from a stall about 50m away. Guess it's because it's a Saturday.

I rarely get to Singapore these days, in retirement, but always visit here when I can. Good beer, good food, and still run by Charlie's family. This time I had the pleasure of meeting him for the first time in years. If you are in the Changi area, call by

Booked via phone through Leonard for two at 6pm. Never realised Car park in Changi Village was a nightmare despite 4 public car parks & even Hotel's also full. So wasted 20 mins to get a lot. Good thing, they still reserved for us a table when we arrived. Came here with excitement & hype-up expectations because of watching this eatery on TV about how good & great this 'father handdown to son' business. So much bragging abt its signature dish, their famous Charlie's Corner Fish & Chips. 3 things brought about the horror. The service was seriously bad. I read so much about its poor & slow svc but i want to see for myself, & they were dead right, terribly slow & frustrating, both inside the kitchen & outside waiters. There were only 16 tables & only 2 staff in sight or rather out of sight most of the time. I saw frustrations from the faces of diners adjacent to our table, 3 families were complained that they had waited for so long before we sat in. On our left, a young couple with 2 young kids aged 4 & 6, were waiting for almost 25 mins & nothing was served yet. Oh boy, i just wonder whether the founders & owners are human enough to see young kids having to wait till they starve. Even the waiting staff had eyes to notice that these are young lives, kids yet they could close both eyes, pretending to be blind nothing's happened. Then, on our right was a family wt 2 elderly parents, having waited for 20 mins wt nothing served at all, not even a simple starter or drinks. On my front was a couple who ordered the appetiser cold shrimps & they had been waiting for almost 1/2 hr. Boy oh boy, we are in for our nightmare. Our mushroom soup took 20 mins to arrive & what's so silly of the uninitiated staff, no spoons were given us. So food came but how to sip, no spoons. How to grade such service? Hence, we had to wave at the waiters & bear in mind, none is at sight. So we had to wait for spoons. I wonder whether the owners could tolerate & accept such ridiculous service? We tasted the soup & both of agreed that even Ikea's mushroom soups taste so much better, & cheaper. It's like poured out from a can & further diluted wt water. That's how upsetting. Every time the waitress passed by our table, she seemed oblivious to empty glasses that require topping up water but she just walked away. Did we pay for Service charge? Another 20 mins later, finally our long awaited Fish & Chips came. It was much to regret because the thickness of the fish was so pathetic, less than 1 cm. most good Fish & Chips which we ate are at least 1.5cm thick or more & they are juicy & moist. Here, they are so thin & dry. And to pay $15 is not justifiable, kind of daylight robbery. The amount of coleslaw was so miserably little, about 2 tablespoon only. The tartar sauce was no big deal & nothing to shout about. Anyone can just make it. Truly, this made me lost my trust on what the TV showed & i lost ny faith on any more recommendations from the TV, totally lost its credibility & what rubbish had been said & shown. It's a real shame. I drove almost 30 mins to reach this place & if i knew this was the standard & quality, I think Jacks Place could anytime served much better Fish & Chips & the amount of sides is many times more humane than Charlie's. Our final dish was the Chicken Chop. For $16 worth, the chicken portion was pathetic, only 6 inch by 4 inch, very small indeed for market size unless I'm earing in a fine dining restaurant cooked by Michelin Star Chefs. The brown gravy was like eating flour. To be fair, i like the potatoes. Kudos to that one. Again, the greens were so miserably little, just about 3 spoonfuls & with only 1 pathetic cherry tomatoes cut into half. If i compared to eating in Australia the way they serve their greens, this one is a big shame. I dont expect equal amount but at least, a reasonable 5 to 6 tablespoons of greens. The really nice thing was the cool breeze blowing in from the sea. All in all, would i return, i doubt so unless the owners are willing to seriously desire to retain us & do something tangible for us to come back. Because when we do come back & found things improve to its original vision & mission to genuinely want the best (in food quality & portion, & good service) for customers then we, on our part, will obviously & naturally bring more friends, families & crowd to support & to enjoy dining there. Would i recommend someone else? Of course, i wont & i would share the lousy experience & encounter i had. What i fear most is in most times, the owners are not aware that their kitchen staff (inclufing chef) & waiters are not performing their utmost best behind their backs. And when owners are around, they put up a good show. I hope my constructive feedbacks are for both the potential customers who read this & for the owners to see what's really going on

First visited almost 10 years ago when I was doing my undergraduate research on Pulau Ubin. At that time, it was a craft beer haven for Singaporeans. 10 year and a renovation later, Charlie's corner has not lost its rustic charm.

Great selection of craft beers and a western food, my all time favorite charlie's famous fish & chips the price reasonable and a lively atmosphere. The service is so so. Conclusion give it a try if you happen to be near the area.

Nice Place in Singapore to chill out with friends and family member. Great food served and 1 of the widest range of beers from all over the world. Service was good and their weekly special was so good.

These Guys serve up an excellent Steak. Like all the Restaurants around them they are not 5 star but the food is great and dining outside near the Coast there is always a cooling breeze which is fantastic

Service COLDDDDDDDDDD tiger beer , good surrounds. But, at night can be a bit noisy. But, were' they to have a good time with company and to enjoy a different landscape

This is a non local food joint. Our group had grilled and Fried Fish, Sandwich, noddles.This small order took about an hour. Only two other tables had people on it, meaning it was not very busy. It seemed, that only one slow person in kitchen.The food was OK, will not say anything exeptional but not bad at all.Tried Langan juice, that was too sweet

Charlie's corner is a great place to sit and step back from the bustle of Singapore, a great selection of beers and ciders, good food and excellent service. I cant think of anything nicer on a Saturday afternoon than sitting over looking the park with a cold pint in front of me and the hustle and bustle of the Hawker centre in the background. Well worth a visit

Charlie's corner has a laid back setting in a middle of a hawker center. It's pretty breezy here at night. Enjoy a glass of beer and chat your night away. My favorite dish here is their Fish and Chips. It isn't too oily and easy for the stomach. On days where I'm not too hungry and crave for a glass of cider, I will pop by for a simple dinner. Located at Changi Village, you can take a stroll down the broadwalk after dinner. Pretty romantic for couples. But be beware of mossys

Was at Charlie's Corner last week. It's a very unusual location - for me anyway! - lots of Asian restaurants clustered together in one location. We ate and drank at Charlie's.. The food was great. The young lady who served us couldn't have done more for us. The price was quite reasonable. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Singapore

Happen to walk past this place last weekend and saw this crowded corner next to a food market. Went to have a look and ended up having some beers and food with my wife and kids. This place got great selection of beers with Alcohol content ranging from 3.8% to a massive 32%. We had steaks, fish n chips and the hot wings. I personally find the food were good and the price are reasonable. Friendly waiters and watress. Definately will patronise this place again if i'm back in Singapore
