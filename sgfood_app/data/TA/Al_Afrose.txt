Good place for Indian and Malay muslim food. It is a cheap joint and quality is good for what it charges. Recently renovated which makes it look better.

This is the place to go for cheap, but tasty Indian food anytime day or night.
I always have the Prata for breakfast. Many people like the curries.

Been coming here for over 10 years. When we come from Europe and stay at Great World City, jet lag means that we get a bit hungry at 2am. Al Afrose always hits the spot and is excellent value.

This is a typical small saivar located conveniently on river valley road. Food is quite good and reasonably priced. Prefer if the food was less oily. And it's always open even super late in the night..

So if you are visiting Singapore you can skip this place, but if you live nearby you should go often. The food is good and it is super cheap. The staff is friendly and helpful. We love the Roti Prata and mutton curry

We go here all the time,the food is a great mix of indian,malay and asian fusion.The Mango Lassi is always cold,thick and delicious.We always sit outside as it is cooler with the fans going,inside has been renovated.The roti Prata is freshly made,I almost always have the Chicken Kebabs which are freshly made in a tandoor.Delicious,but do not order these if you are impatient as they are made to order.Prices are very good and a couple can easily eat for less than SGD$2

My wife and I are foodies, having relocated to Singapore we were always destined to try new places. Al Alfrose is now considered our local eatery, I've lost count the number of times we've eaten there, with friends and family alike. It's nothing glamourus compared to it's restaurant neighbours but that doesn't matter, it's the food that counts and Al Alfrose delivers here not only on taste but value too. We've become quite friendly with the owner having made so many frequent visits, there's no doubt he's built a great business with happy and dedicated staff always willing to offer its customers a great service.They cater for the different regions but with a strong focus on Indian cuisine with quite a vast menu of items. By the best dishes are the dosas for me, I can quite easily devour 2 or perhaps 3 in one sitting, they're that good.Definitely worth a visit for a meal which will set you back a few SGD$

After watching a play at Victoria Theatre, we were in the mood for teh Tarik (literally translated as pulled tea), so we headed here.Though it was almost midnight, it was still quite packed, as were the Five Star and Boon Tong Kee chicken rice eateries next door, as well as the bar cum restaurant at the corner.We went for the egg and onion pratas, which were freshly cooked and therefore fluffy. The plain pratas were not as good, probably as they were cooked earlier and then reheated and were doughy as a result. Their fish curry had a nice spicy kick, but also tasted powdery from the spices. They also have a wide range of other options, including murtabak, different variants of fried rice and noodles, and a wide variety of hot and cold beverages. Do try the teh halia, or ginger tea.It was relatively inexpensive - four drinks and four pratas came up to slightly over ten dollars.Parking can be limited, especially on weekend nights, so go round the corner towards the church. It might be a litter further but there is a better chance of finding a spot there

I went out cycling on a weekday night. Have not been in the River Valley Area in the last couple of years and I happenstanced on this joint. River Valley is away from the Orchard and Mohamed Sultan areas so its a bit more like the suburbs. The warm lighting was quite different and not as glaring as white in the night. Ordered Seafood fried rice which was served in 7 minutes and teh tarik that came much earlier. The foods reasonably good and the portion is good too. Especially if you've been cycling. Ended up with two teh tariks at the end of the night which means I sat slightly longer than I planned to. All in All a nice place to hang out late at night and not crowded. Well at least not on a weeknight
