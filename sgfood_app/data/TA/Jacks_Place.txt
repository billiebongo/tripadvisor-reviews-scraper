Staff were friendly and patient. Prices have gone up for set lunches and food portion seemed reduced. Missed the cheaper set lunches! Good if can bring back.

Went to this branch for our office lunch. Food was pretty decent and service is good. Will return again.

Had the set lunch which was decent and reasonably priced considering it came with coffee, dessert and soup of the day. The main I had was fish and was quite blend. But overall still decent for the price you pay.

Staff was helpful, food was great. Fast service. New paper ordering slips are a bit confusing though. Nice experience overall.

My sister decided to bring us to this place after it underwent renovation. Sadly, the childhood memories of nice dimly-lit Jack's place and green checkered table-clothes has been replaced with a much brighter environment and laminated placemat. Overall, the food is still amazing as well as reasonably-priced

A place my parents use to bring me when I was a kid. The place brings nostalgic good old days. The food has improved.

Jack's Place feels like a local family member serving you and they do try to be attentive for each table and serve accordingly after you are done with each dish.
Good service.
Food serving wise just nice.

We usually go Jack's for their set lunches which are rather affordable even on weekends. Opt for the better steak option instead of the standard one and always order medium or even medium rare even when you like better doneness... Their steaks usually end up slightly more cooked so it is always better to err on the slightly raw side. Love their baked potato with all toppings.

I have been going to Jack's Place for years. For this visit, I had their Thursday Set Lunch deal - S$15.80 +++ NZ Sirloin Steak, BBQ sauce with Shitake Mushroom and Thai Asparagus. The steak was nice. But I did not find any Shitake Mushrooms and the Asparagus was nothing great as it was just 2 stalks and was a bit over boiled so it was rather tasteless.I like the fact that you can opt to change the set lunch dessert to Udder's Ice Cream with a small top up amount

Everyone enjoyed their meal but nothing special. My steak was ok but served on a hot plate so my med- rare steak turned to med and med well before I finished. The service was good and the price was pretty good, $99 USD for five meals without alcohol. I think you can do better here

This is my very first time here and i like how the ambience of the restaurant itself is very casual and somewhat home-y. I ordered the NZ striploin (if I don't recall wrongly) and I was quite amazed by how thick the cut was! Also, the baked potato topped with sour cream, spring onions and bacon bits is incredibly satisfying! (You can ask the waiters to add more of the toppings if you need more.) The overall experience was good and will definitely go back to try other food

Brought my mom to the Great Wirks City outlet as she wanted to eat their signature oxtail. I ordered a Cajun chicken and my wife had a beef hor fun.The oxtail was tender and tasty. Still reasonably good after all these years. The Cajun chicken was just a pan sheared chicken topped with a white sauce. Where are the spices like thyme and paprika typical of Cajun style? Strangely, there is a piece of gyoza sitting on top of the chicken. East-west cuisine perhaps.The beef in my wife's hor fun tasted stale, like it has been tenderized and sat for too long. It had a bitter aftertaste to it. It's also very strange to have a green salad on the same plate, soaking up the beef hor fun sauce.We had the dishes sent back to the kitchen and gave our feedback to the manager. He was kind enough to waive the charges. Thank you.I don't know how far can the chefs will take our feedback though. I suspect their are just cooks using the ingredients and methods given by the main kitchen. It is quite a disappointment as they have recently re-branded and positioning themselves as a quality restaurant with grass fed beef and a wine list. I think the chefs at the central kitchen does not have the same passion as the owners.Just a sorry experience. But I may still have to bring my mom back for her oxtail.P.S. The garlic bread was stale

This place was opposite where we stayed and recommended by the staff. Fantastic steak and grills. The biggest mixed grill I have seen outside an Aussie pub. Lovely staff.

Celebrated sister's birthday here. You can inform the staff beforehand and they would bring out the cake and play a birthday song in the restaurant. Ordered their Jack's special steak and upgraded to lobster bisque soup. As the chef there tend to overcook the steak, ordering a medium rare one is better. The soup is great! Love their mango sliced cake too. As for their escargots, standard has dropped though the flamey presentation when serving the escargots is a good photo opportunity. They had recently changed their membership program.

Went to Jack's place with family one evening. I remember the old Jack's in Yan San Builibng (?) as the place to go for a reasonable steak at a reasonable price. Unfortunately things have changed, and not for the better.First of all, when we turned up, there was no record for our booking and we had to wait for 15 minutes before a table was ready for us. The menu was quite extensive and seemed interesting. We had to remind the waiting staff to bring us water, plates and napkins as there was insufficient amount on the table. We started with a shared buffalo wings and some calamaris. For the mains 5 of us settled for tenderloins and one opted for fish and chips. The wait for our meal was quite long. The steaks were quite well cooked and presented and of adequate sizes. The fish and chips were good too.Service was non existent. Some of the staff were not properly trained and just plonked the food on the table, in drips and drabs. Price wise it was reasonable for steaks in Singapore

I remembered Jacks Place to be a great feed for a good price..... Its changed and sadly not for the better. Servings used to be big and wholesome, not now... The "fillet" steak that I had was not tender and was overcooked (possibly cooked then recooked/reheated)The menu options were good, and the increased pricing is acceptable, if the quality matches. Sadly on this occasion, the standard of food, service and hospitality was not what we had been witness to a few years ago. I write this poor review, but am willing to return again, just to confirm if I had come on a "bad" night or if things have gone down hill forever.

I always eat at Jack's place compass Point as I lived nearby.Food is nice, service is good and value for money. They have changed the menu but I still prefer their old menu and is disappointed that they do not have top up $4.50 for soup, dessert and coffee promotion anymore.Nevertheless, I will still patronise jack Place.

Tenderlion was nicely done and tender. Lobster bisque could have been better as I had better one with more flavour at the same restuarant. Staff and service is normal and nothing much to mention. Overall, a good place with family for a decent steak and quiet enviroment. Will return again

I was here with my family members for lunch and was very disappointed with the waiting time for the food here. I do understand lunchtime is busy but we ordered a Seafood Basket, we waited and waited til the 3 of us has finished our main course and neither the Seafood Basket or the dessert has been served to our table Neither do the management or the staff follow up and they ought to speed up the service and have enough manpower during busy hours
