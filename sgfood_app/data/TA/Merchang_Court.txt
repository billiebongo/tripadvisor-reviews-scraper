Excellent International Buffet with something for everyone. The food was all freshly cooked from the kitchen that could be viewed from the Restaurant. The staff were very pleasant and helpful.

The buffet breakfast is very good. Singapore is not a place to go out for breakfast so your only choice is to eat at your hotel.

Ideal for stop over, staff are friendly and rooms ideal for sleep catch up in comfort, the bar meals can be a little pricey, but Singapore is pricey

Good quality, a little spicy but nhey you are in Singapore, I had the buffet but I wasn't that hungry so I didn't make the most of it, however a lot of locals go there so it cant be bad

Great place to visit especially as the sun goes down. Great places to eat, drink, or just people watc.

Many places to go for a quick lunch or a drink. It was rather crowed in the evening and one of the place outside Chinatown where you are not alone in the street in the evening...

We stayed at the hotel on the walk and were able to find an ample supply of restaurants both reasonable and exotic there. There was much to see while exploring the river area. People watching was fun because there are so many people of countries round the world. There also were activities on the river.

Great lunch buffet spread and superb service experience. The food was also great and exceed our expectation. The hotel staff, Fabien(Ast Outlet Manager), Eunice, Shanhan and Annis make us feel comfortable and provided superb service. Appreciate the patients to introduce the menu and special dishes. Plates were clear and water was top up timely. My department feels like a VIP guest.

5 friends and I are in the middle of a short stay in Singapore and could not have picked a nicer hotel or location. The rooms are very comfortable , the staff always very friendly and helpful and the breakfast lacks nothing as far as choice goes. Located close to the river and numerous bars and eateries.

We don't normally eat in our hotel but with rain pouring down we stayed in for lunch and were so glad we did-there was a terrific variety of East Asian and Chinese food all freshly cooked-and most of the clientele were local - always a good sign
