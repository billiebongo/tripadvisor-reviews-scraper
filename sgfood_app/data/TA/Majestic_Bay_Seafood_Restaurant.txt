This place looks really nice, but its expensive and the food is not great. The staff are not at all helpful and the service is so slow. I would have chosen somewhere else but we were a large group so was difficult to keep walking.

Thank you Yvonne. The engaged couple was very relieved the meeting of the families for the first time was well done.

Ambience is good and relaxing. The food is good and service staffs are attentive & polite too. V.gd!

This Restaurant is designed to be expensive. It looks good, it’s very clean and staff are very professional and helpful. But... they are not friendly, not even one smile. I had a tasty bamboo soup, and not so tasty radish cake. So little bit disappointed. And prices on the menu are without service charge and without tax
5
We had lunch at this restaurant and found that the food and presentation was really good! Heard negative reviews about this place and so was a little apprehensive but when the dishes came, I was really happy with the taste of food. The menu that we had was not cheap but it was worth it! Service was very good too

We were looking for something convenient after walking round the two conservatories at the Gardens by the Bay. Despite looking a little empty and touristy, the Majestic Bay Seafood fitted the bill.There’s a huge menu with no end of exotic fayre, and you can spend a fortune here (the couple on the table did just that), but there’s also a S$29 set Dim Sum lunch menu which was perfect. A selection of four dim sum, a Japanese egg custard, fish with egg fried rice, and then a couple of deserts were all sufficiently exotic and filling.I don’t think I would have been inclined to pay for an expensive meal here, but the set lunch menu was just what we were looking for
2
We came early to the park. It was hot and sticky. We thought after a few hours, this looks nice and cool. A slow, fancy lunch would be good. We were wrong.The place looked ideal if pricy, $90 for two for lunch, but neither the food nor the service rated the cost.Service was very indifferent and mechanical. Nothing was explained, commented on nor inquired about. The staff appeared, threw something on the table and disappeared. Water, ice, droped utensil well we'll get it with the next course.The food read well, 6 courses and varied chinese. What came were very tiny helpings - sometimes less than a tablespoon and often not the correct temperature . Nothing specialEven paying took chasing someone down. I'd skip it

We chanced upon this bay-facing restaurant as we were making our way out of Gardens by the Bay, and since it was time for dinner anyway, we decided to stop here for our meal. Located on the ground floor and with glass walls looking out across the view, Majestic Bay is primarily a seafood restaurant, as you can guess from the fish tanks next to the entrance. They do, however, have plenty of other things on the menu besides seafood, including dim sums. Both my husband and I are very fond of dim sums, and our toddler—otherwise a fussy eater—can generally be counted upon to eat rice and pork. So we played it safe and ordered two dim sums: five spice pork belly with charcoal buns, and glutinous rice with Chinese sausage and peanuts. We also accepted the offer of jasmine tea. It didn’t take long for the food to arrive, and when it did—in great big bamboo steamers—it was very nice indeed. The glossy grey charcoal buns looked very interesting and tasted delicious with the tender, juicy five spice pork belly they accompanied, along with some crisp lettuce leaves. I hadn’t known that the glutinous rice would come wrapped in lotus leaves and steamed, so that was a happy surprise (I like leaf-steamed goodies, usually). This was even better for me, and I gobbled up two of the four packets in the portion happily. The jasmine tea, with frequent refills of hot water, was very welcome. All of us enjoyed our meal (even though our toddler, by the end of it, was too tired and sleepy to want to eat any more). We especially appreciated the staff, who were warm and friendly. Our toddler got given a high chair, and a cute little plastic plate, glass and cutlery of her own, and was on seventh heaven. We paid a total of S$51 for our meal, inclusive of taxes. Note that the tea, the towels (not that I used mine) and salted peanuts—which I suppose are served if you order alcohol—are all charged for and not complimentary

We had a lunch in this restaurantWe ordered 3 types of dim sam. The first one 10 pieces pork was good. The second we received we did not ordered and after some discussions we undersrand that the third one is not available...I asked for napkins and received an answer that they do not supply napkins...only the wet one in the beginning of the lunch.The service is poor...You may consider other place..

I came here for a dinner to celebrate a special occasion and overall, I think it fell a little short. I'm a visitor in Singapore so I don't know the area too well but having spent time around the gardens by the bay, seeing this restaurant, it looked great so we came here.The menu was a great one with an awesome choice of a la carte, set menus, seafood and dim sum.We ordered lobster noodles, soft shell crab, spring rolls, scallops in XO sauce and beef tenderloin Chinese style. The food was decent. The scallops in XO sauce in particular I thought were excellent. The rest of it was nice without a wow factor. I think perhaps the location of the restaurant combined with the menu prices, my expectation was high and this didn't meet them.I've had nicer meals in Singapore at a much cheaper price.Some weird quirks as well with the service. They didn't have napkins rather but instead wet wipes. That they charge you for. It was weird, you're in a restaurant that looks reasonably high end and not only do you not get a real napkin but have to pay for a wet wipe? It was just odd.Overall I think there are much better eating options available
3
Went there for family dinner. The peiking duck was a disappointment. The seafood and crab is kind of normal. The restaurant is kind of cramped. With price they charging, there are many better places.
4
We tried the $68++ Set menu. It is available for weekend lunch and dinner!!! Really good deal. Just nice for two persons.
4
The food was excellent. We ordered from the per person menu and were very pleased with the variety and the amount of food which was fresh and very tasty. The service however, was rather impersonal and unfriendly. We were shocked to discover that we are charged $14 per person for Chinese tea. If you are looking for good food, give this place a try. If you are seeking excellent service and a friendly environment, I would give this restaurant a pass
4
We visit this restaurant in hot peak Christmas day, make a reservation via call in advance. We choose a 6 pax dinner set where we get it from their official site(they post a full menu on it) Restaurant take our reservation base on trust and do not ask for any deposit even on the peak day. And they do get ready the table on time for us. Food serve fast, hot and fresh. Price slightly higher then outside Bay restaurant, but i think is okay as you still enjoying good "free" night view after the dinner by the bay.This is a kids friendly restaurant, you do not have to worry about kid seat, utensil or the noisy they make... low level of rumble is acceptable here
2
Before starting the Skywalk (and after exploring both domes), we had lunch at Majestic Bay under the flower dome. The food was quite tasty but pricey and there were screaming children everywhere...to the point where the other half had to repeat himself so I could hear him say “this reminds me, I need to book that vasectomy”. It was so loud we sat in silence for most of the meal, as did the table next to us We had Shanghai dumplings, Peking duck pancakes and 2 cokes and it ended up being over $65 so not a cheap option, but very convenient. The food was good, real shame about the noise level and lack of any management in relation to this.
4
One of my favourite seafood restaurants for a meal whenever I return to Singapore. The quality of the food remains outstanding and the environment at Gardens by the Bay superb. The only shortcoming I felt was that they were short handed when it came to wait staff. The staff were all eager to please, but it was clear that they were harried and we had to ask more than once each time we needed our tea pot refilled. Hopefully the management will be able to hire sufficient staff to ensure that the dining experience matches the quality of the food.
3
The food variety is limited although this is one restaurant where you can find the very expensive Emporou fish from Sarawak.Last Friday we made reservation at 730 pm for dinner. We arrived at 7pm. We had to wait although the restaurant was less than 50 % occupied.We ordered food for 6 people but we had to reduce the order because of massive traffic jam our guests were told to wait al least another 60 min to get a parking lot in Gardens by the Bay. The service staff was surprisingly very helpful and obliging in adjusting our food order. Credit to the staff.Food quality was a disappointment
3
Everything was chargeable from plain water ($3) to takeaway packaging. Food portion was small. Ordered half pekking duck but felt like only 1/4 duck given.. unless the duck was a tiny underweight duck? Luckily their food tasted not bad.. otherwise for the price and service, I would give all a 1 star rating.
1
The first impression of the restaurant is great when we walked past. After we went in for our dinner reservation, that’s when everything starts going down. First we see the menu, the menu selection isn’t very fancy. Irregareless we picked those item that is stated as (most popular/famous for). The yellow duck firstly is too expensive and simple. $4.80++ for a single duck, and trust me the duck size is just like a normal bun size. Moving on to the next item, the famous coffee crab. I am a coffee lover, after I ate the crab, I legitimately quit drinking coffee. The crab firstly is not even fresh at all, it’s the worse crab that I have eaten for my entire life eating restaurant famous for crabs. Crab meat is suppose to be soft and juicy, the crab that was given is tough and powerery. And it’s not even a Sri Lanka crab, it’s just a normal mud crab. But even the mud crab that I bought from the market will be fresher then this. Lastly, I would just to say. Eat at your own expense, if you’re willing to pay for the amount for a standard that low, then it’s up to individual preference. Good luck:

We really only needed a place to sit down as we had an elderly person who needed a rest and it was nearly dinner time. The staff were extremely accommodating and served us drinks and coffee with lots of good humour and made our visit very enjoyable
5
Wonderful food and service. I will definitely go back again with friends and family. The view was also fantastic
4
The place was located at a nice place with a good atmosphere. Food were good and staffs were friendly to recommend some dishes.
4
Dim Sum was excellent especially the lobster porridge. You can opt for noodles instead of porridge as well. The pepper duck bun is also excellent - lots of black pepper and the meat was nice and tender.
4
The coffee crab is very special. Nice but a bit sweet. The dim sum is fantastic. Very fresh the prawn.
3
So, when you are seated at your table there is already the following at your table, a little bowl of peanuts and a wrapped handy wipe on your plate. 1st up. If you eat or use you pay.2nd up. Prices on the menu are exclusive of tax.Onto the meal. We only wanted a snack before hitting Cloud Forrest.We ordered the Shu Mai, Dumplings and Whitebait.I couldn't stand the Waitbait, too fishy tasting but my partner managed to finish the plate on my behalf.Both the dumplings and the Shu Mai were great, I preffered the dumplings, my partner the Shu Mai. In reality, hard to split
3
Food was okay..Restaurant was not crowded.Gardens by the bay member had free welcome drinks too.Food was of acceptable quality, and decently priced.Crabs were a little on the small side.I was offered 2 small crabs at the cost price of what a big sized crab would cost. Found it weird though, as larger crabs would be more meaty and the smaller crabs would comprise mainly of shells...Having said that, the wasabi prawns were nice..
4
We were concerned that this restaurant might be expensive and not very good given its location near the Flower Dome but we were hot and hungry and thought we'd give it a try. We weren't disappointed. We shared a few entrees and they were delicious. The crispy pancake, the spring rolls and the dumplings were all well cooked and presented
5
Dining by Gardens by the Bay is interesting on a weekday late afternoon, we enjoyed people watching and enjoyed the quiet ambience. The Peking duck was on a promotion till end of July and we had that. It was good. They stir fried the duck meat with noodles - although it was slightly on the salty side but it was nice (noodles was nicely cooked and there was slight gravy in the dish). The cute ducklings bun are not that worthy though. They are cute but don't taste as good. We didn't ptry the dimsum.
4
1st time dine at Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant after strolling at Flower Dome, we ordered steamed Shanghai pork dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), the dumplings is succulent with some soup inside the dumplings, we must make a hole to drink up the soup 1st, after that we eat the dumplings. Delicious and enjoyable!Good service in this restaurant and friendlyÂ staff as well. I enjoyed greatly!
2
We chose this restaurant based on location and how it looked when we booked during the day while in Gardens by the Bay. This was our last night of a big trip and we wanted a memorable experiance. This place is not memorable or worth the money.Maitre de was polite and agreeable when I asked to have a seat with a view, not the back wall. Wait staff took peanuts. and tea cups from our table when we were seated. We noticed asian guests offered green tea and peanuts. Some tables set better and Asians seated at those. Signature dish of chilli crab rolls was lacking in crab. At 6.30 pm the kitchen was out of crispy skin duck. Roast duck was ok. Fried yam and vege dish ok. No. plain rice on menu. Ordered a bowl for $1.50. Other rice and noodle dishes very expensive.Asked maitre de why we weren't offered green tea and he said westerners don't like paying for extras. Presumptuous and incorrect.There was no napkin/serviette at our table, unlike others. When we paid the bill we were charged .40c for the towelette on plate. Suggest westerners use the tablecloth to wipe hands.The hawker market on Beach rd had tastier food
4
Interesting Dim Sum menu with an emphasis on Seafood. The dessert of Mango purée was refreshing and not perfumed or over-poweringly sweet!
5
The service staff were friendly & attentive. Our classmates had a lunch gathering (36 pax) and the staff were willing to snaps pics for us.
The food was really fresh, (the steamed fish), the chx soup in fresh coconut was really clear & yummy!
4
We had a lovely lunch at this restaurant. We wanted to have a good look at the gardens so we had lunch after we had looked at the first glasshouse. The service was excellent and so was the food.
4
Food is great, but portions could be bigger. the best hot and sour soup among Chinese restaurants in Singapore.
1
They charge for napkins and no one smiled not kid friendly manager rude don't bother overpriced
Attitude unpleasant.sad on last day of trip to this great city
5
My partner and I didn't think that this place would be very good due to where it was situated (that being right near the flower dome, so it would get a lot of tourists and potentially not have to have high standards) We thought we'd try it anyway as they had a few deals on for their signature dishes (the chili crab buns, and Nutella duck buns). All of the food we had was delicious, and we ended up both agreeing it was one of the best meals we had in Singapore (and we did go to the east coast seafood centre for a dinner). Friendly staff, and extremely fresh and delicious food - I would recommend going to anyone. Only minor down side is the wine list, but I found this a constant in Singapore, not many restaurants serving a wide range of white wine by the glass. Being from Australia, I think I am just used to being spoilt for choice at home.
4
This restaurant is situated at the Garden By the Bay. You will need to take an escalator down one level. The restaurant has a beautiful view of the bay. It is a great place to grab a Chinese meal before or after visiting the Flower Dome. The Chilli Crab meat buns are excellent. It is slightly crispy on the outside but warm and soft inside. The taste of the chilli crab came out nicely. Not too spicy. The asparagus was excellent. Full of flavour and just the right texture. Not too soft nor too hard. The whole coconut soup was good but could have more flavour. The salted egg crab is good for diners who do not like spicy food. The only disappointing dish was the fried diced seafood with mee sua. I would definitely return for another meal. The only problem is the restaurant is situated rather far away from downtown Singapor
4
The seafood and fish in this restaurant could not be fresher. The fish are welcoming you in their aquarium when you come in. The restaurant is big, super nice and somewhat upperclass, about 60 sgd for a normal meal. Too bad our waitress did not seem to like her job, she was not friendly at all and told us she could not split the bill; which was weird; considering EVERY other place in Singapore does. So good food, moderate service...
4
Had my anniversary dinner there and it coincided with Gardens by the Bay's 5th anniversary so we had the chilli crab buns, steamed garlic soy razor clams and yam n nutella duckling buns all at $5 each. Great food and lovely ambience and friendly staff. This has become my favourite haunt

Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant Service located at 18 Marina Gardens Drive Gardens By the Bay, it is an excellent exposed location, advertising a great wonderful restaurant ,this is the place to eat ,well I was so wrong and disappointed to enter in an organized so called circus . Ordering is very slow as the restaurants seems to have insufficient staffs, the food is served, cold and the staffs have no idea how to cater for people . The food is tasteless and service is inactive. Staff seems that they attending a funeral, No one smiled, little let alone them very rude, we felt invulnerable throughout. To sum up in few words, my dining experience ranks one of the worst dining experience in Singapore .Most of the food we ordered was absolutely tasteless, honestly to me, Hawker Centre food tastes much better. This place is expensive and poor value for money definitely overpriced! I should have known better the place is mainly for tourists. WITHOUT A SHRED OF DOUBT WILL NOT RETURN
3
Food is mainly Dim Sum & dishes for lunch. Dinner are dishes that are ala carte or set. Pricing can be too high for average simpe lunch. Staffs are generally helpful. Situated at basement beside Gift shop !
3
If there's only 2 adults, having dim sum dinner here is probably not a good idea as almost all of them comes in 6 pieces which will be too much for 2 adults. Also not all dim sum are available for dinner.
3
Stopped here for the dim sum lunch while visiting the Gardens by the Bay. The food was ok but nothing special. Service was efficient although the servers could be a bit more friendly and smile once in a while.
5
Located at the gardens by the bay flower dome. Ceiling to floor glasses . Authentic dim sum and expensive seafood, didn't give a try on the seafood.
4
Went to Majestic Bay Seafood restaurant for the first time with no expectation of what is to come of the food. Had a pleasant suprise that the Chili Crab was pretty good! The beef cubes stirfry was quite nice and so is most other dishes we ordered.
2
Went with a friend at lunchtime after visiting the gardens and dim sum was being served. We asked for a small meal as we were both hungry, and we also wanted some sparkling water. We could order individual dishes. On the menu it simply stated SG$5 for the water but did not state the bottles were 500ml. We ordered one bottle each, and left most in both bottles (we could easily have shared) and there were no caps available to take away. There was a small bowl of peanuts on the table which the male waiter removed as we sat down. The food was not what we expected (read that as awful) and the squid cost SG$15 even though we left it all. On receiving the bill we were charged SG$1.50 for the peanuts. We queried this, and it was reluctantly refunded. My friend, who is normally very polite and obliging, said the staff were' very frosty'. Not our best experience in Singapore and we would not recommend this restaurant to anyone
3
Caveat : I always benchmark my dim sum with HK's...We ordered the set lunch here which came with Dim Sum set (Steamed prawn dumplings, steamed minced pork (siew mai), fried prawn bean curd, fried carrot cake. Out of these four, only the carrot cake meets my standard. We moved on to the chawamushi....it was well-executed & good.Then the fried rice with fish. The fish was good, but the fried rice...really lacks wok hei. Finally the dessert.....the chilled papaya fungus was good but the mochi.......gosh! the coconut was definitely not fresh. We took a bite and refuse to finish it.Maybe we order the wrong dishes. The set lunch is supposed to showcase how good the food is, in order to have repeat customers. Er, don't think I will visit this restaurant again.....considering how often I do come to the gardens. We spent close to S$80 for this......i know of better places where the dim sum is better executed for less. Even using SG's standards for dim sum, this restaurant's dim sum is lacklustre.
1
Service and ordering is very slow as the restaurants seems to have insufficient staffs to cater to the crowd. When the food was finally served, it was cold and the staffs have no explanation to it. Food is average, nothing fantastic. I guessed it's crowded because there isn't much restaurants available.
4
This restaurant has generally good service except for the wine service. They have average wine glasses. We had the Majestic Bay Trio Prawns Combo, double boiled seafood soup, five spice belly pork, dragon tiger garoupa, live crabs in chili sauce, braised tofu, fried rice and purÃ©e of mango.
2
With an excellent location, great signs out front and the display of living fish near the entrance this restaurant seems to be able to have it all. However with a staff that disregards guests and quality of food that is average at best, we certainly won't recommend let alone visit here again
3
thought the restaurant looked nice and had a good atmosphere in gardens by the bay. on arrival, I was surprised to see a very touristy crowd. menu was mostly Chinese but also had thai items (another sign of tourist market). I won't be visiting again.
4
Good dim sum I would say on most food, except the yellow duck bun, too expensive for it value. Not that fantastic as it mentions, too ordinary. But the rest of the dim sum is good though.
3
This restaurant is conveniently located to the Gardens and thankfully we didn't have to wait for a table. However, there is a strange smell as you enter the restaurant and the food is average...
2
One of our family members suggested this restaurant for our Chinese New Year (CNY) dinner gathering for the 8th day of CNY. First visit and will not worth a revisit.While I was writing up my blog to review this restaurant did I know from the restaurant's website that the dishes are created by an award winning chef...for the price of S$1088 set menu for a 8-10 pax exclude tax and GST and add-ons, the food taste (2.5 dishes out of the 10 dishes are better ones) is not worth the price. Fusion Chinese meals that are your average food given the twist in creation that does not go well. For eg. The crispy pork trotter from a first bite, the meat was soft BUT when you take a deeper bite, the smell of pig is too strong to push you to further consume the remaining meat.To add on while we were there, we had to bear with loud speeches and noise from 2 tables which I presume were having CNY dinner as a company function, throughout the whole of our meal. Truly a disturbance to the rest of the diners.Unlike other Chinese restaurant holding CNY lunch/ dinner within the same price range, the plates are not changed before each dish was served. Thus you were having the toss salad, yusheng, with the sour gravy and the next dish was Stewed whole abalone in beancurd sheet bag and broccoli flower, which I will not want mix in gravy
1
So I went here last Sunday brunch and as a keen fan of Dim Sum I was looking forward to a lovely morning. In all honesty the food wasn't terrible but value for money was bad and the waitress was obviously having a terrible day because she missed an order and was rude beyond belief. Any question was too much and both serving and collecting plates was just unfriendly. Her lethargy just annoyed the hell out of me because she was so disinterested in being there. If she was in a $2 place in china town you would expect that level of service but when you are spending that money you deserve better.... Oh and the restaurant deserves better - the manager looked friendly enough but that his staff were like that doesn't say much about anyone.The location is great and if someone wanted to pay for you and you get to drink a great deal, then maybe it would be ok to go back... but as a destination to take your family before wandering into the fabulous Gardens by the Bay, I would humbly suggest that you go elsewhere. There are so many wonderful places for Dim Sum - this place deserves 1 star and they should really think about having their staff smile
2
Restaurant has an awesome location between the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest however that was about all it had going for it.You pay for every little thing, such as the wet towels on your table (30 cents each) and the tiniest bowl of peanuts ($3.00) which are sitting on the table when you arrive.The food was fairly ordinary, quite bland and and lacked flavor. Staff had trouble communicating with us in English and the only water on offer, had to be paid for. It was expensive for the size servings, though offered a wide choice.Staff were helpful even if they didn't understand our questions.We won't be going back or recommending it
5
Although they claimed the award winning chili crab but my family and I still choose the blackpepper crab over anything..Their lobster salad and honey buns were also superb..The price were a little bit high but worth every penny..around SGD 50-70 per person per dine in..The waitresses were great..quick response..The place was stroller friendly.
3
Located inbetween the two pods at Gardens by the bay so convenient for lunch when visiting this attraction. It's an attractive , large restaurant. We ordered the set menu. A small dish of peanuts was on the table together with a 'wet wipe' hand towel (individually wrapped) we ate the peanuts while we waited for our order but did not use the towels - we were charged for both ! So be warned !! The food was quickly served but in no order they just brought everything as it was prepared rather than as it was shown on the menu in a very hap hazard way. The dim sum was lovely but other things like the soup was inedible but maybe that was just our taste. Alot of items on the set menu were very bland and tasteless - cheap fillers rather than quality dishes so I would not recommend it - rather choose your dishes individually . It could be very good but due to the sharp practice of charging for silly items and some of the food items tastlessness we left dissapointed and annoyed.
5
Our reservation was for 6pm and we were pressed for time as our show was at 745pm. Fortunately, they allowed us to get in at 530pm. They cooked the food quickly and we all enjoyed the great food. We were a party of 16 who came out satisfied, even my mom enjoyed and she doesnt like Chinese food
3
overall experience was okay. the food itself does not give me a 'wow' or very delicious feel. price of food was expensive/way overprice for certain dishes. service quality needs room for improvement as the staff did not seem to take the initiative to clear our dishes that we already finish when serving us with new dishes. we had to alert them to do so. was impress with the seafood fried rice for the amount of seafood that is added in and the taste itself is great. and also the lobster platter as well was tasty. we order 5 dishes and one of them was the yam ring which was a great disappointment, do not recommend that. chili crab was ok
5
the food was great - superb flavors and mixes.
only knock would be on the serving size, which could be bigger.
other than that, great food, great stuff and great location!
3
Overall the food was good, but do they really need to hit you up with a mandatory .6o (Singapore dollars) for 2 towelettes and 3.00 (Singapore dollars) for the peanuts on the table?
5
Celebrated my dad's birthday at the restaurant on a weekday. Food and service were great! Will definitely go back again!
4
Had lunch at the restaurant today. Had the honey pork bun and steamed shanghai pork dumplings finished off with the oven baked walnut cookies. Does not have many choices without seafood. Recommend you turn down the towelettes and peanuts, if you don't you pay for them.
4
When you walk into a Cantonese restaurant and realise you're the only Europeans in there, the rest being locals and other Asians, you're probably on to a winner. Another good sign is the menu is first and foremost in Chinese with English as a back up. That was lucky though as, otherwise, we wouldn't have had a clue. When we looked at the prices it was a bit off-putting but, at lunchtime, there is a Dim Sum special menu which is more reasonable.We selected a variety of dishes between us and were able to try each others'. We got some helpful tips from the guests on the next table too! The food was of a good quality.The service was friendly and reasonably quick.One note of caution though. You have to pay for the peanuts and the (frankly, not much good) moist tissues on the table WHETHER YOU USE THEM OR NOT. At the prices charged, that took the edge off things and felt a little bit tack
5
If you're tired of the same run of mill Cantonese restaurants, Majestic Bay is definitely worth a try. Cost approx. SGD 75 per person for very good food/seafood. Our party of 6 had a really good dinner here recently. Their dim sum is very good (served all day). The seafood was excellent. The bamboo clams probably the best I've had. The baked rice in assorted seafood was excellent. Steamed Soon Hock - excellent. And a few other dishes too.
2
I have dinner with client here for 15 persons. We choose this place because they can accommodate up for all and great location after we walk at marina by.The taste was simple. I don't recommend for people who need great taste. The service is excellent
2
Dining here was a test of patience and endurance. 5 dishes took more than 2 hours to be served. Very long pauses between each dish. I waited at least 20 minutes for the dessert which was just a simple aloe Vera jelly. Food was slightly above average but definitely not worth the wait
4
The dim sum is good and for a Tourist outlet, service and food are exceptional. We enjoyed the asparagus and scallops in XO Sauce. As a Singapore citizen, I object to being charged for Tap water. It is a rip off and you have to pay $3 in addition to other beverages ordered. I object in principle on behalf of tourists visiting Gardens by the Bay who have to pay NOT FOR BOTTLED WATER but ordinary orders of water. The Management and Tourist Board ought to look into this. Very silly of Majestic Bay Restaurant management - they can charge $3 for condiments etc (which other restaurants do
3
We had soft shell crab in lemon butter milk sauce, Hokkaido clams and their signature kopi crab. The coffee crab was overcooked, meat was tough and hard to peel off from the shell. The sauce however, was delightful and flavorful. Could have gotten a better coffee crab at serangoon. The softshell crab was slightly fishy but the sauce saved the day once again.
4
Great location when you have overseas guests in town and want a different experience, walking through the Gardens to reach the restaurant. Food is very good, we ordered the set, and favourite dishes were the prawn appetiser, seafood soup in coconut and salted egg crab.
4
Very good food, excellent menu very well served. Great crab buns and fish. Highly recommended.
Lovely views across bay and is located right in the gardens by the bay.
4
most of the items we ordered were good. the signature chili crab buns were a bit too spicy for us though! convenient place for a bite if u are spending several hours at GBTB. otherwise, it would be quite out of the way :)
1
Lunch hear with family. Waiting staff incredibly rude, waitress actually attempted to remove my daughters plate while she was still eating. Food was slammed down in front of us and while we tried to eat, waitress kept hovering, saying, 'you finished'. Food extremely average, and you will get stung by the hidden charges, face towels, even the hand-wipes. They were really annoyed with us, when we checked the bill and I asked them to take off 'peanuts' (on table and we didn't eat them), 4 of the hand-wipes (also on table which we didn't use), instant saving of $6, not much, but you can see how their hidden charges will add to your bill. If you like dull food, rude staff and paying over the odds, then this is the place for you
3
We ordered the set menu which cost 30 something Singapore dollars, there were 7 of us. I calculated our bill would cost more than 200. My husband was surprised when he saw the bill and it was more than 300. They charged us for the nuts which we thought were complimentary and for the hand towels. When my husband asked why were charged for the hand towels , he was told that it is normal in Singapore restaurants. Why didnt they inform us beforehand? The food was average and overpriced. The lady who served us was quite friendly

The restaurant is conveniently situated between the domes of the Gardens By The Bay, so you'll easily be enticed. Just be aware that as soon as you sit down, you're racking up the bill! Before a server even approaches, you'll see a small bowl of nuts on every table. TOUCH THEM & YOU BOUGHT THEM at a stunning $5. You'll also see a hand towel in a sachet, sitting with you knife and fork. Open it and guess what?... that's right, you'll find it on the bill. The perception of your staff as to what is 'spicy' and what is not', is probably different from yours. We made it clear that a meal wasn't at all spicy/hot and ending up sweating profusely. So be careful there too. On the whole, not great service, not that good food. But couldn't see too many alternatives as far as actual restaurants go

Wife and I decided to try the Dim Sum that was advertised over the radio a few weeks back. The restaurant was easily located at the Flower Dome of Gardens By the Bay facing the Marina Bay. This was our first time to this restaurant and we did online reservation to arrange seating for closer view of the bay. When we arrived, the restaurant was quite empty and we were promptly greeted by the front desk. We were ushered to the couples table that were away from the glass windows. Reservation was overlooked for slow Monday afternoon. The deco is pretty modern and had floor to ceiling glass frontage facing the Marina Bay. However, we were a tad disappointed we did not get to be seated near the glass panels. The restaurant was also on the ground level which could not capitalize on a better view of the Marina Bay so seating near the glass panel did not matter in the end. Back to food - since we were there for Dim Sum, we did not look at their signature crabs. However, we did have some chilli crabs without the mess in the form of pan-seared chilli crab meat buns. We also had the "must-try" baked honey pork soft buns. The pork fillings were more flavourful than the chilli crab bun. I, however, prefer the crusty type HK style polo buns. We did not enjoy the lotus leaf glutinous rice as it was not fragrant and we had better ones before. Staff service was prompt, however, smiles were not hanging on their faces. There were still lots of other dishes not tried and the photos advertised in the menu looks so temptingly delicious. Will still visit if we are around the area for dinner

This was my 2nd time here. Food was ok but the service was really horrible. A waiter accidentally caused my aunt to fall and the GM did not even bother to come and check if she was ok. Even when I requested to speak to him, he did not come over and asked another waitress to attend to us. His reason? He is not in charge of the waiters and I shouldn't expect him to handle this just because he is the GM. I do not think this restaurant value customers at all. You can definitely find better food and service elsewhere, and at a lower price too

The restaurant is conveniently located within Gardens By the Bay and has a huge full-length glass wall that allows patrons to look at the beautiful scenery outside. The restaurant is nicely decorated and has an up-market feel to it.But the positives end right there. There is nothing much else to shout about. It is at best an over-priced local restaurant set in place with a slightly upmarket decor. To be fair, the food is not that bad. For lunch, we had the lobster bee hoon which was on promotion, and some usual dim sum dishes. The meat dumplings were tasty and so was the braised chicken feet. But, for that price, they weren't really that worth the value. As for service...don't expect high standards. The head waiter (or is it the manager?) looks like he's running a factory and did not even bother to demonstrate any customer service. He just did his job matter-of-factly. There was this family waiting for their table near the entrance. When a table was eventually available, this manager simply waved and snapped his fingers to get the family's attention and then pointed to them to go to their table. I was utterly shocked. This was just not how a fine restaurant should be. And so, this is no fine restaurant.If you are taking a day trip to Gardens by the Bay, and have a craving for some Chinese restaurant food or dim sum, then this would be a convenient place to go. Otherwise, there is no reason to dine here
1
The food was nice but the service was atrocious. We felt like our presence was an annoyance and an inconvenience and our waitress looked like she'd rather be anywhere else. She was rude, looked miserable and slammed our food down onto the table. It was very disappointing to have our experience ruined by terrible service
3
We went to Childrens park before dinner. This is literally 2 mins walk away! Kids enjoyed the 1/2 roast chicken and duck buns. The crab was HUGE!!! And very meaty.
4
Very pleasant cool peaceful ambience for lunch after walking around Cloud Forest and Flower Domes. Very tasty signature chilli crab buns - 4 of us ordered a second helping. Also enjoyed the other dumplings and buns. Good service.
4
Enjoyed an evening meal here after visiting the flower dome and cloud forest and whilst waiting for the evening light show. Definitely more appealing then the fast food outlet just outside. The menu was extensive and reasonably priced.
5
Dumplings, pork buns, excellent sweet and sour pork with a twist and a cute duckling yam and nutella bun to end with. Yum!
4
Very fresh seafood served. Well prepared food and displayed well. Looks good, tastes good! Service needs to be improved
5
Food quality is good and not as expensive as I thought. In addition there is promotion on lobster bee hoon which was a surprise. Unlike other restaurants they will not give you pressure to leave although they close at 9pm but we were still eating/talking.
5
We tried 1.8kg crab that was cooked in espresso. The dish was delicious and the gravy was heavenly. Definitely a must try when one visits Gardens By The Bay!
2
Family had a mixture of dishes; food was not that tasteful in fact some dishes were down right disgusting! Couple that with the expense and this is a place to avoid! Plenty more to choose from where food is near perfect and at much lower prices!!!!!!
1
The menu outside would show prices ranging from $5-15. Once you get inside, the price changes to 5x of what's outside. I asked the waitress about it and she said the price is the same. We can't get up to leave because we started eating the nuts on the table. Those cost $3 each (see that little serving). The wet tissue costs $1.5 each. They don't have service water. Nothing in this resto is for free. We spent about $150 and we only had the regular serving (good for 2-3 people). The food is OK but I would not recommend this for anyone on a budget
4
Some hit and misses for the food. The daily soup was good, and hearty. Roast chicken and the oatmeal prawns were too dry. Go for the seafood, since they have live tanks there.What I liked is the service. The staff were very attentive and took initiative. Such as stacking two chairs so that my nephew could reach the table better. We also celebrated a birthday there, and had cake, and the staff presented the cake very nicely. Thank you for that
4
Location is close with dorm that easy to proceed as well as good taste of food. The staff is also very nice and kind
4
Coffee crab was good but kinda small, other dishes were also good. We went there with 3-yr old daughter and was served with kids utensils and staff are nice too.
5
We had a business meeting to deal with on our first night of holiday before we could fully relax. Our hosts insisted on treating us, and my goodness did they ever. We were treated to a variety of different foods, fish, crab, steak, scallops and finally a pancake with "red bean" filling. Initially thought red bean??? But wow. This restaurant is not on the budget conscious travelers list I can assure you, however it is good.
1
We were seated at the table by smelly trash and a dirty wall next to us. Asked to be reseated but were told that the other tables are for larger parties; not exactly true as there were an older couple seating at a table for four. After receiving the menus waited and waited for the waitress... At the end we just left. Horrible
4
We went into the restaurant after walking around the Gardens by the Bay. The restaurant is only 20meters away from the exit from one of the domes so very convenient. We chose several dim sum dishes and a couple of fish dishes and it was all very tasty. The service was efficient although not exceptional. Worth a visit and not expensive
3
The dim sum served at this restaurant was of good quality and quite refined. The ambience was comfortable, with large full length glass panels that overlooked the bay. Only thing that can be improved is the service level. The staff could be much more attentive to customers
4
Visited this restaurant with friends, so made up a party of nine. We were seated, Chinese style, at a large round table with a 'Lazy Susan' in the middle on which an array of dishes were placed throughout what turned into a Chinese Banquet over at least two hours. The seafood was incredibly fresh, well cooked and tastey. The bar provided us with a selection of beers, mineral water and JasmineTea which was replenished as required. Although busy on a Saturday evening, the staff were attentive and served us with no difficulty. The atmosphere was friendly and the restaurant comfortable.

Considering the location and the hype over this place, I would have to say, it is overrated. Let me try to be as critically mild as possible. The view is not half bad overlooking the marina barrage but has a road in between with lots of walkers and joggers and cyclists. The service includes some waiters who don't understand English which is a big let down in a place like Singapore. The language of business is English and you cannot have staff who are not trained to understand the language. If it is drinks you are looking for with your meal, you better try somewhere else. They have very limited stock with almost all of local or Chinese origin. When asked about whiskey they showed us a bottle the name of which I couldn't even find on the internet. Some of the dishes are not half bad but for a seafood restaurant, it is horribly short of variety. The crab preparations are decent, but for foreigners, you definitely shouldn't go back from Singapore with the opinion that this is the best there is. On a scale of 10 in terms of crab cuisine in Singapore this gets a 3. Try Long Beach on East Coast Park and you will know what Singapore sea food is all about. (More on that on their review page). And please, oh please, you should never try the signature dish here, called Kopi Crab (Coffee crab). It was so not the way a crab is meant to be cooked. Keeping with my promise of being mild, I will only say, don't ever order this here. Otherwise, the staff were prompt and the lighting and the space was decent. You can have a go at the baked fish with gravy. It was really nice, like the silver lining of this dark cloudy experience. In short, the reason this place is so hyped about and does good business is attributed solely to its location in the heart of Gardens by the Bay. It is always flooded with hungry tourists aching to have a good meal after walking around. But please don't go back from Singapore thinking that this is the standard of sea food here.(that is if you choose to try it of course). This is clearly at the bottom half of the ladder

When we arrived, staff just blatantly ignored us as we waited to be seated...maybe they are very busy...chatting? When there are more arrivals, then one came over to sit us, but serving people behind my party first (*scratch head*)Service gets better during the dinner and the service staff are more attentive.Was quite disappointed with the food. Had their signature lobster beehoon and garlic beef, both tasted average, and not as flavorful as I was hoping...Their spinach with 3 eggs is alright, so is the prawn with salted egg yoke; but really nothing to whao about...Their chilli crab bun must be eaten immediately otherwise it becomes soggy, taste wise...it's alright, again no wow-factor.Quite a good view of the bay area and skyline from the restauran
3
Average restaurant. Had more expectation. Didn't quite meet. Service not that great, even charged automatically the tissue and peanut - when we didn't even consume! how careless is that??? very assuming. I made a reservation, but seemed like can be seated anywhere. I dont mind paying high price for a good experience. Their price is not worth it.
3
It seems to be understaff. We waited for 5 min before we were usher to our table and 30 min for our food items to arrived. But serving for the reordering was fast not sure is it because it is after lunch hour peek (1:40pm).
4
This is a very nice dining facility. It is a little pricy, but service is great and the food was fantastic.
1
Poor service, food was less than mediocre and very overpriced. We paid our bill for lunch for 2 of us in cash and had to ask twice for our change - approx. £25. Really bad experience overall, would recommend that you DON'T eat here.
5
It was our first time at this restaurant! Prompt service, and quality of food was good! A great place for family gathering!
4
Had a lovely time with family..nice ambience great location good food. Highly recommended for family and corporate gatherings
3
They seemed understaffed. Waited for a long time to get a table even though the restaurant was only half full. Then we had to hail down a waitress who seemed to be walking back and forth and not interested in taking our order. The same thing happened when waiting for our bill. Luckily the food was good but a bit pricey.
2
Food is good I'll give them that...However: forcing you to take dishes for 2 people and up, dishes are small and very expensive compare to the cost!They give you some peanuts and charge you 4$ usd for it without you even knowing!Same for the towels!Tables are too close to each other and you feel like your eating with other people next to youJust save your money..
3
I got to go here with a bunch of colleagues for a dinner after a long day of meetings. The location was great as it was located within the Flower Dome vicinity. Service was efficient but almost robotic. At least, it was not slow or non-existent.The food was not bad. It was just okay. They served crabs as part of the lauriat. The crabs were not very fresh. I guess they could be fresher. The dish was called Bay's Kopi Crabs. It actually tasted like caramel popcorn except they were crabs. I guess this was one time when I wanted just the simple Singapore Chilli Crabs instead of innovation.With the wide array of choices for food in Singapore, I will likely not be coming back here for seconds
1
Went on the weekend, dinner.Had to queue for parking.Service was normal, it was noce that they called back to confirm reservation.Menu is badly design.Ordered most of their signature dishes, food was salty.Resturant was never full.Lastly no chope discount on weekend.Never going this place again
1
To me, this place is a tourist trap. We ordered the wasabi prawn, the kopi crab, salted egg yolk bun, seafood fried rice, and some stirred fried veggies. All the dishes were equally disappointing. Both the wasabi prawn and the fried rice were topped with fish roe, which I don't think compliment the taste of the dish.The kopi crab wasn't well-cooked. Also, we were told that the crab was 1.1kg, which I really doubt so. The total bill was over 200. I normally wouldn't complain about the price IF the food is nice. I'm not sure if the standard was affected by the crowd on New year's eve, but still, I would not recommend anyone I know to visit this place
1
I a hire this as a practice especially in Singapore. Only very expensive mineral water on offer despite a 300sgd food order. Sad to say does not matter how good the food we will not be back as they do not offer ice water.
3
The food came very slow in such we miss the return buggy. The waitresses not very attentive got to call a few times then they notice is.
5
The food preparation, service and ambience is excellent. We had prawn dim sums.. very delicious !! Just the BEST. Strongly recommended for anyone visiting Gardens by the Bay.
4
Food was good. However the sequence of the dishes served could be better. They served the fried rice first followed by the dim sum and vege. Then we had to wait for 20 mins before they served the soup and another 10 mins for the steam fish
2
And so after enjoying the gardens by the Bay decided to have dinner before going to watch the light show Christmas carols at toy landDespite many tables that were empty a notice outside read no free tables sorry for the Inconvience, one member in our group asked why this notice when so many tables were free and was told it's ok leave that you want table I got it. One friend ordered a whole fish one ordered chicken rice and one member ordered do sums plate of 10 piecesThe chicken rice , the chicken was dry not what we know as chicken rice kind, the fish was ok but for its size 7 inches long the whopping price of $ 75.00 the do sums the outer skin thick . The whole bill was $ 275 + This restaurant and the Quayside seafood one in Clarke quay another daylight tourist rip off have left us feeling that they give Singapore a bad name. One of our local friends mentioned that they had heard similar stories of this place too.The guy who took our orders was very rude and inattentive as wellIncognito personelle should be sent to check such places and their licenses revoke

Majestic Bay looks good on paper. Great Singaporean seafood at a central location at the Gardens by the Bay. Arriving in the restaurant the first thing we noticed was that it was really cold inside. I mean absurdly cold, as first customers are walking in the humid +30 degrees Celcius and get in to the restaurant where the temperature must've been +18 degrees tops. We asked if they could've turned on the heat a little bit and the answer was a plain "No". After going through the rather confusing menu we finally ordered. The plates arrived one by one with at least 15 minutes between each plate. So at one point for example there was only rice at the table for everyone to share (which was ordered as a side dish) and no main course. After waiting and shivering for approximately an hour we were given no explanation nor apology why we weren't getting our foods and once we asked about it, the waiter's answer was a blunt "I know it is taking long" with no smile. And half an hour after this we asked again as no food was arriving, and the waiter looked at us angrily but didn't even answer. Unbelievable.Because of the confusing menu we weren't totally sure what we ordered and once we paid for the food, we noticed for example that 4 little pieces of tofu that we ate costed an absurd 68 Singaporean dollars and that they were charging us for some peanuts and tissues that we didn't even use. The food itself was pretty decent but given the horrendous service and the large amount of $ that we paid for it I cannot honestly recommend this restaurant to anyone
4
The specialty at Majestic is the Kopi (coffee) crab. If you're a tourist looking for chilli crab this is NOT a replacement. It's a special dish worth trying for its caramel flavours, and the sweet crab Majestic uses is particularly suited. And there's a wonderful bit of showmanship involved, but I won't spoil the surprise. The chicken was also really delicious: we had roasted variety, which came out with crispy skin, juicy meat. Rare combo, top execution. We weren't particularly impressed with the char Siew Bao, which strangely came as a min order of 6 so we had 3 left. Also, the restaurant closed at 10 on the dot which seemed a bit early (we started dinner at 845pm) but understandably transport out of gardens is tough for the staff. Otherwise the biggest point was the ambience. The chance to stroll ard the super tree grove is a magical experience that is well worth doing... And what better way to finish it than with some Kopi crab
3
This was my first restaurant experience in Singapore in over 20 years. Fortunately my experience at this restaurant was not normal for other restaurants which i discovered over a 4 day visit. The food, Dim sums was acceptable and the Shanghai dumplings were particular good. What I did not like was that the table was set with fresh face towels and a bowl of peanuts before we had even sat down. Curiosity go the better of our group and on asking the question we were advised that they were NOT complimentary but a charge out item. We had not ordered these and we felt it was a deceitful practice. Beware
5
We shared a fantastic dim sum luncheon here. The price for what we ordered was reasonable but the menu on the whole was high end. For a special silver service eatery it would be a very fine choice the offering was delicious & top notch in presentation & quality. Choice of crab, fish & lobsters from the live tank. YU
4
We were visiting the Gardens and decide to have lunch in this restaurant. There are 2 fix-prix-menu ($28 and $33). We decided for the most expensive and had a very good experience! We didn't know the food, but it was a good surprise! We felt very satisfied! Service was just OK
3
Had lunch today. Service only fair. Very limited non dumpling food. Had lunch here a couple of years ago and believe it has gone down in quality. As part of Gardens on the Bay a better menu is needed.
3
I ordered crab and there was nothing special in it. Neither too good, nor too bad. But I personally feel that rate was too high.
3
Food was good, but for the price, it's not very 'value for money.
Atmosphere was nice.
Service is very so so.
2
Popped in during a visit to Gardens by the Bay... Staff were apathetic at best (bordering on downright rude)... Took 10 minutes to get menus and another 10 to order.... Waitress obviously did not want to be there... We considered ordering chilli crab but decided that we would have dim sum instead (thinking this would be the quicker option) When the waiter finally came he kept talking over the top of us and went to leave 3 times before we finished our order.Lemonade was flat. The dim sum was tasty but on the greasy side... We ordered soup which was the last thing to arrive - the garlic not cooked properly.... Had to nearly walk out get bill....All in all I don't think the food is good enough to justify any kind of bad service.... Go to McDonald's instead - at least you'll get your meal with a smile...
4
My Dim Sum aficionado son and I had a very nice lunch here after visiting the wonderful surrounding attractions. The quality of the food was excellent and the ever present staff very attentive and courteous. Pity the bill included $3 for peanuts we neither ordered nor ate and $1 for each refresher towel whether we used them or not, which we did not. These items are laid out on the table seemingly as a courtesy with each meal but appear on the bill regardless. The cost of the unused items was removed from our bill when questioned but the audacity to include them in the first place left an unnecessary sour taste in the mouth from what otherwise is a worthwhile lunch destination. I hope the managers of the restaurant read these reviews and remove the practice or explain why it is necessar
5
We had dinner in this seafood restaurant after visiting the Gardens By The Bay. The restaurant has a convenient location at the base of the Flower Dome. The view through the full length glass panels was so good while we were enjoying the delicious seafood. We originally ordered Singaporean chili crab but the manager recommended their signature mud crab cooked in Kopi sauce. We had never thought that the taste of mud crab matched so well with coffee. Other seafood dishes that we ordered were also well prepared. We also enjoyed their warm service which had eased our fatigue after touring around different spots at the Gardens from morning till evening
5
Their coffee crab is MUST eat item. The dish including the taste of coffee, caramel and Chinese wine. They will set the fire to burn the crab in front of you. Fantastic. Another suggestion is their "Lobster Bee Hoon", but too oil to me.P.S. The temperature (Air conditioning) is very cold. & The location is a problem
2
$1 for a paper refresher tissue, $3 for a tiny bowl of fake peanuts...whether you order them or not. Grumpy waitresses and staff. It was so noisy, we had to leave before we our ears burst, and never got to order a meal..still charged $54 for two small tiger beers and two orange drinks. Reminded me of the inn-keeper in le miserables. A rip-off..go there at your own peril
1
Was very disappointed we paid $41.+ for 6 tiny spring rolls and 6 pork bun & a couple of iced tea which is a joke. Well below expectation, price should match the food quality which for us just average taste. When we paid our bill the staff who attended to us was rude, never smile and in fact raises her voice. Didn't even tried to speak the common language so as tourist can understand somehow. Management should send the whole staff for training at least six months to specialty school in improving customer service relationship. We won't recommend this outfit to tourist, not worthed go somewhere else
3
sometimes after coming to Gardens by the Bay, one feels like Chinese food so there is a niche for this place. Also this place is always full so certainly one thinks its good. So they have dim sum and they have a lot of seafood dishes. Some dishes were decent like the toufu and baby abalone. Some dishes were just bad like their lobster noodles. So essentially come here only if you need a fix for Chinese food.
5
good Cantonese food in Singapore, also good in sea food and dim sum.
nice environment:) after garden by the bay trip, just enjoy your food there.
餐馆的广东点心，在新加坡算是一流水准（当然是指在新加坡）。蒸鱼也不错，火候刚刚好。当然环境就不用说了。我去过超过5次了。
4
A wide array of seafood platter of various kinds and taste.Food looks appetizing but Sumptuous. Great with a mug of beer. Courteous staff with time to time placement of food onto the table.
4
In years gone by I'd have never come in here. Why spend $50 on dim sum for two for lunch right next to a major tourist attraction when you can spend a fraction of the price getting the tasty, authentic hawker food that Singapore is famous for?Well, fast forward to having a tired jet-lagged infant, needing to get a feed in quick to get him napping and this being by far the closest option. So in we go.To be fair, though it's not cheap, the food was good. The chilli crab buns and various dumplings and the prawn pancake were particularly good. The setting is very pleasant.Service we found ok, although there was a curious incident of staff claiming they didn't have chicken rice when it was clearly advertised outside
5
Went there for lunch with my parents and uncle. The tim sum were delicious and the noodles with Boston lobster was definitely worth it. It was going at S$50 as the restaurant is celebrating Singapore's 50th year of independence in the month of August. Most importantly, the service from the crew were excellent. Thank you to every crew who did their best in managing the crowded restaurant
4
Situated near the domes in Gardens by the Bay, this seafood restaurant has a nice view of the garden surroundings and offers interesting dishes and good seafood. Despite its modern setting, it is still displaying live seafood in tanks to patrons before these end up on your plates, just like the traditional seafood restaurants. A good place to enjoy some local seafood delights after a walk in the gardens
3
Having just finished Gardens at the Bay and the flower show next door, it was definitely time for lunch.Majestic Bay is right between the two, and seemed to be the logical choice.(Do yourself a favour; if you like photography or plants - visit the Gardens!).We were told to wait at the bar while until a table became ready, which would have been great if the bar was open, even to serve water or soft drinks.The fish in the tanks looked rather second hand, with a couple of tanks having sinky's or floaty's rather than fishies.Service was not not great. There was very close to a 30 minute wait for a boiled rice and stir fried fillet steak.We asked for the rice, steak and duck to be served together, however had to ask twice for our duck to come to the table.I would say that even for Singapore standards, the meal was over priced and other worth it, even though the duck was very very nice
4
My family of 3 adults with two small children visited the Flower Dome at Garden by the Bay and we had lunch at the Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant which is located just below the Flower Dome.The restaurant has a very pleasant and bright deco and live seafood are displayed in the tanks at the Restaurant’s Entrance. The staff at the restaurant is very friendly and efficient and we needn’t have to wait long for our food to be served. Our order for a Crab meat fried Rice, Fried Seafood Rice Noodle and two of Tim Sum dish turned out to be very good.Definitely a good place to have your meal and rest your tire feet after your visit to the Flower Dome
3
It is lucky that the food was quite good, because the service was not. We were walking through Gardens By The Bay and decided to stop for lunch. We enjoyed the food and it gave us the energy to continue touring. But it is the sort of place that you would not come to specially - you would only pop in if you were at Gardens By The Bay. Or then, you may consider some of the alternatives in the area
4
This restaurant is perfectly situated in the Gardens by the Bay, adjacent to the Forest Cloud and Flower Dome, a great place to meet friends for lunch.We met friends there and had the Dim Sum for four, not having had this before we were very pleasantly surprised, we had a large number of different dishes which we found very enjoyable and finish with fragrant pear served in Pomelo Jam.The staff were attentive and provided good service, I would definitely eat here again
1
After the sensation of the Flower Dome and the Forest Cloud we went in here looking for a pleasant lunch. What a disappointment ad we strongly recommend that you do not eat here. As others have stated the service was terrible. This attitude was dismissive from the start and never got better. The food was very ordinary - the alleged local sensation of Singapore Chicken Rice was bland and the chicken undercooked. And for the one serve of 10 piece pork dumplings, one serve of chicken rice and 4 Tiger beers we received a bill for $SG124.30. Included of course were the handtowels and peanut charges as others have described. This place is a blight on the otherwise excellent aspects of this area. You have been warned.
4
Very pleasant to lunch there, after having discovered the wonders of the Two Domes. The food is excellent and not a tourist trap.
1
This restaurant provides horrid service. The staff puts on such a long face that you wonder if there are any return customers.
The food is just average.
The coffee crab - please skip it altogether.
Never gonna return, just not worth the visit at all.
3
Lovely cool spot for lunch when you visit Gardens by the Bay.The dumplings were quite tasty but I’ve had better hot and sour soup. They seemed surprised and unprepared when I asked for soy sauce and chilli and it took forever to arrive. The service was quite disorganised, I wondered whether these were the usual staff or were just filling in for the day.Oh yeah, the peanuts on the table trick! Can’t believe I fell for this one, it’s an old Singapore speciality. When you sit down they give you a jar of peanuts and refresher towels. A lovely gesture you’d think because it’s hot outside and the walking has made you hungry. It’s not! They put these things on your bill. It’s a stupid, cheap thing to do. I would have tipped despite the so-so service but I was so annoyed I made a point of leaving exactly the right money.Lots of places to eat in Singapore, this restaurant falls into the bottom third of the ones I’ve been to. If not for the location, right in the middle of the wonderful Gardens by the Bay, I’m not sure this restaurant would have much of a future

My daughter stopped for a snack after visiting Flower Dome. The table we were escorted was preset with hand towels and peanuts in a small bowl. We assumed they came with the meal since they were on the table the server gave to us and we had not requested them. At the end of the meal we were charged approximately $$4.00 for them. Although we requested to see the charges before they were placed on my credit card they did not show us the itemized list of charges. The server simply took my credit card and processed it giving me the receipt. Since we did eat the peanuts we did not dispute the charges. I do not consider this restaurant to be an honest representation of the good reputable businesses I have found in Singapore. It is sad that a business of this nature is located at "Flower Dome & Cloud Forest"
2
If was not because is located straight to the garden exit I will never go visit. We was 6 hungry friends we go with a bit of expectations and we end up disappointed. Food is Ok but I can found same standard at more reasonable price. Service a disgrace. Turista trap, when you go take in mind that anything is on the table is chargeable and nobody dare to inform you first about it.
1
Ambient is fine, location is good if you are downtown. Hospitality is fine except bad service on beer They keep on bringing out new jar of beer before the serving jar is half empty. It makes the taste of beer stale especially if you have oversea business associates. Coffee crab is another disappointment as it taste too sweet. It is not likely to be a place for me to bring oversea business associates again.
3
This is a convenient place to dine when you visit Gardens By The Bay, especially if you are catching the light and fireworks show in the evening. It is not too pricey (it's mid-priced for the area) and the ambience is okay.Service was alright, though it was slightly strange to have to order drinks and food from two separate staff. Foodwise, it was okay. There were some nice dishes, such as the steamed fish and braised duck, though the vegetable items were rather ordinary.To be frank, the food was not too memorable - it was more the convenience and the proximity to the light show that drew us here

We visited Majestic Bay Seafood on a Monday afternoon for lunch while we were at the gardens.The menu appeared varied and extensive which was good as we wanted options. We found the price to be a little high but were imagined this was the case because the restaurant seemed to be 'high-end'.The food was average - nothing special or extravagant. The portions were decent. We found that the men's suggestion on portion size was accurate and helpful.Service was poor and we found it unacceptable for the type of restaurant. Staff were inattentive and didn't engage in conversation with us. Considering we were clearly tourists, it would have been nice for staff to suggest meal options for us (specialities etc). Further, they gave us the bill before we had finished our meal - we had just finished our appetizer and were waiting on our main. No one even bothered to come ask if we were enjoying our meal or if we would like a top-up for our drinks. Not acceptable considering how empty the restaurant was.Finally, we were initially overcharged. As other reviewers have noted, we were charged for two foil-wrapped disposable towels and the peanuts which they place on the table. At the bottom of each page of the menu it does state that we would be charged but not how much. I had already opened one packet before realising these towels were NOT complimentary. However, it would have been nice for the staff to check the other towel had been opened and we had consumed the peanuts before being charged for it. However, staff were quick to remedy the situation when we brought it to their attention.Something else to note is that diners receive a 15% discount if they present their ticket to the Cloud Forest/Flower Dome

Ordered the set for 2 plus chili crab. Food quality was good and taste delicious. Bill came to sg 220 ish abit pricy. Pity they do not have a set meal with crabs. Would surely be a great hit.Restaurant is clean but ambiance abit lacking has a little hollow feeling.

I brought some colleagues there for dinner as it was at the Gardens by the Bay (below Flower Dome). Very spacious setting. Restaurant seemed a little quiet perhaps because it was a weekday. The food is pretty good. I recommend the coffee crabs - there was a pretty fire show that came with it. Super yummy. The other dishes we ordered were also equally good. Worth trying

The pan seared chili crab buns were amazing. This restaurant does takeaway. 6 buns for $15. Delicious.
3
There were several empty tables but we still had to wait... This was during the Singapore Garden Festival. Think the place was understaffed.
The food was OK but service is extremely slow....
4
It looks really grand from outside, and it was nice as service and chinese food (seafood) were great! We ordered set lunch (multiple courses) per pax, and it was worth it and satisfying! Will definitely come again and again! Thank you Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurent!

Sadly this place is so beautiful and the food wasn't too bad but omg the service is shocking. Walk in and get treated like a animal...not one person showed any emotion or even eye contact. The staff were loud handling the plates, and setting the the tables roughly around us as we eat.I could get better customer service at macdonalds...spoilt our beautiful and amazing night out. Even got charged for complimentary peanuts on the table and napkins..leaving the bill was $85 of disappointment

The place seams nice but inside it's cold as ice. Service is poor and you feel more like a number than a client. Food is common you'll find better in small restaurants in town. The prices are way too high for the basic food served. Another tourists trap

Last weekend, I had lunch at Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant. This is located at Garden By The Bay – Flower Dome. When you are at the main reception area of the Flower Dome (where you can purchase tickets for the flower dome), take the escalator down to the lower level, and its on the left of the escalator. Here are the highlights of my meal:- - Dim Sumo Signature Chilli Crab Meat Bun: Done as a dim sum, where the crab meat is cooked with non-spicy chilli gravy and wrapped in a bun that is pan fried. Not spicy and it was nice.o Scallop and Prawns Dumpling: This is done like a fried wanton. It has cut up prawns and sliced scallops filling. Good.o Minced Pork and Yam Dumpling: Minced pork fillings in a mashed yam ‘cocoon’ that is deep fried. Crispy on the outside and a good dim sum dish to order. Try it!o Steamed Vegetable Dumpling: Assortment of chopped up vegetables in a crystal dumpling.o Shanghai Pork Dumpling: This is popularly known as Xiao Long Bao. It is a minced meat filled mini bun, which you dip into vinegar with ginger slices.- - Alaska King Crab Meat Soup with Minced Celery: The soup was slightly greenish in color, due to the minced celery and scooping in the soup, there was steamed custard at the bottom. I also got pieces of Alskan King Crabmeat in the soup. I personally found the soup a little salty.- - Dragon Tiger Garoupa done two ways -o Stewed withTofu sheet, Wild Mushrooms in Claypot: This is my first time tasting the Dragon Tiger Garoupa, which sounds very exotic. The fish has been deboned and filleted. It was stir-fried with 1cm wide cut pieces of tofu sheets and straw mushrooms in a claypot. I preferred this to the garoupa steamed with minced garlic.o Steamed with Minced Garlic: Topped with roughly minced garlic and steamed. There was a coating of starch on the fish fillets, which made the fish slightly chewy. Would have preferred the fish not to have the starch coating, so that I could taste the fish properly.- - Crispy Shredded Duck, Jiang Nan Style: The duck is shredded apart and the pieces are deep fried. The dish is topped with fried taro strips and julienned mango. I found the duck a tad too dry for my liking. I loved the fried taro and mango that topped the dish though.- - Braised Homemade Tofu with Chinese Mushrooms in Abalone Sauce: The tofu were deep fried till golden brown on the outside. The Chinese mushrooms were big and juicy.It came with blanched Romaine lettuce that were crunchy.- - Stewed Bee Hoon with Boston Lobster: Each person got a piece of boston lobster that has been stewed with medium rice vermicelli. The Vermicelli soaked up the gravy and was tasty.- - Fresh Mango Puree with Chendol Strips: The first time I am drinking it out of a tall cup, instead of eating with a spoon.  I will be back soon to try out their steamed yellow duckling bun filled with Nutella and Yam paste

Came here as a group, pre booked business set meal with many courses. Nice setting, very clean, about half-full. Food which was of good quality appeared steadily throughout the evening. Very efficient, we didn't wait unduly for any course and really couldn't complain at all. I was concerned about a number of previous negative comments about poor service but that was definitely not a problem for us. In fact I would have to say that with the high quality of the food, we could not have asked for more, maybe a smile or two, but I would not even say that the staff were unfriendly at all. Favourite dishes chilied crab and pork soup. Fantastic location.

I asked my local clients where they recommended for dim sum, and this was where the suggested. And they were right!It was a bit tricky to find, as the TripAdvisor app didn't have a proper location for it when I was there, and it's not really signposted in the gardens, but I did find it eventually. (I pinned it when I was there, so hopefully it's on the map now.)It's a bit frustrating that they don't do the set lunch menu for one person, but they handed me a little tick-sheet with all the dim sum on it, so I could do it myself. Sadly the signature chilli crab buns were all gone, as I was right at the end of the lunch service, but everything I had was delicious, and I thought it was very fairly priced for such well made dim sum.My main niggle was with the service, which seemed to have been a common complaint from past reviewers. Honestly, I think the best description is that it's Chinese-style! They're pretty brusque, and don't fawn over you or anything, but it's exactly the same approach as I've had in many other Chinese restaurants so once you understand that, it's fine. And it's functional. The food comes out hot, the bill came when I asked for it, and what else do you really need?I'd definitely recommend this place for lunch, but with the caveat that they do close between lunch and dinner so you can't be too late

For full review and photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/07/dim-sum-lunch-at-majestic-bay-seafood.htmlThough Majestic Bay is not a popular place for dim sum and the dim sum selection is quite limited BUT to my surprise, they have creativity and quality! (Helmed by the dim sum chef - Guang-zhou born Chef Li Shou Tao) Die Die must try their Signature Seared Chilli Crab Meat Bun and Steamed Yellow Duckling with Nutella and Yam Paste!Service was good as well, our tea was refilled promptly and plates were cleared regularly. The staff answered my queries patiently even though i asked quite many.. Haha

Firstly, I have to say that I ate here as part of a big group for a hosted business meal so we had a set menu and I don't know exactly how much it cost.However, the food was delicious. We enjoyed a range of dishes such as king prawns and seafood noodle soup which were served on chinese-style revolving tables. This culminated with a magnificent chili crab dish (see photo) which was really delicious. There was also a traditional Singapore dessert for anyone who still had space. Copious amounts of green tea and regular refills of beer for those that wanted it. Service was prompt and friendly. Overall, for me it was a good experience

we made a wise choice when we decided to eat lunch at majestic bay restaurant after a wonderful morning walking through the botanical gardens.
the service was attentive, the menu impressive and the food excellent.
this was a perfect mid-day break.

We went here after visiting Gardens by the bay due to the lack of options. We went for the 28$++ lunch and the portion is ok. We went for an extra ala carte dish and it's really expensive. The food is decent, somewhat good so that's good. The ambience are decent.What I turn me off is they charge for the peanuts they pre-serve on the table.The service was ok only. Some of the waiters weren't very friendly. Besides the fact that this is the only restaurant near there, I wouldn't go for it again
4
We tried their set dinner menu which was priced at S$98++ and enjoyed a Citibank Card discount of 15%. The menu was extensive, of high quality and delicious. The ambience was somewhat lacking but the staff attentiveness made up for it. It is a restaurant suitable for families.
1
We went in just for afternoon tea and coffee. The place was all but deserted. Despite this, the service was extremely slow, the staff far from friendly and far from proficient in understanding English.The coffee was truly appalling and we should have sent it back.The English Breakfast tea was served without milk which had to be asked for. A huge disappointment all round

We were invited to dine at the Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant on 19th Feb.2014. The restaurant at Gardens By The Bay, 18 Marina Gardens Drive, #01-10, Singapore 018953, is located below the Flower Dome in Gardens. After passing the main ticketing office, take the escalator on your right, down, and it’s to your left when you descend. There’s no entrance fee required for dining at Majestic Bay restaurant.The restaurant is managed by Chef Yong Bing Ngen who has had some 29 years experience being the executive Chinese Chef in restaurants at the Pan Pacific Hotel, The Raffles Hotel and The Fullerton Hotel. While keeping true to Chinese cooking, Chef Yong pushes culinary boundaries by harmoniously blending new ingredients which he discovers into his menu.The ambiance of the restaurant is like a ship deck, a wall featuring round mirrors like in “port holes” on the left of the entrance, while the color theme is white and blue. As we came in the evening, the waterfront was not visible. To the left of the entrance, are water tanks with live fish and crustaceans allowing customers to select their ‘food’ before it goes into the kitchen. Noise level can be on the high side there being a lack of ‘soft’ furnishings and no carpets.The menu has a selection of Dim Sum, Sashimi, soups, etc. with their signature dish: Live crabs in Kopi sauce. There are specialties, promotions and set menus. We had a set menu, and had the following dishes:Trio-Seafood Combo. The Crispy fried stuffed lychee with lobster, crab meat and mushrooms was quite a treat. The Thai styled soft shelled crabs were nicely flavored, and the white bait crispy, crunchy and not too saltish.Soup of the day. This was water chestnut with pineapple with a pork based stock. Was sweet with strong chestnut flavors.Steamed, white Badin fish in black bean sauce. The flesh was tender and smooth, not spongy or soft. Slightly firm in texture, flavored nicely with the black bean sauce.Crispy whole duck Jiang-nan style. The skin and parts of the duck flesh was crispy. The garnish was nice with spring onions, shallots and a little sweet and sour.Steamed sea prawn with minced garlic. The prawns were presented halved, well cooked and there were lots of garlic bits. The sauce was a tad saltish.Mud crabs in Singapore Chili sauce with fried buns. This was spicy, but the crab meat was firm and fresh, and the fried buns, not oily.Sautéed Hong Kong Kai Lan. The vegetable came out looking freshly green, nicely sautéed and crunchy to the bite. The Kai Lan stems were not fibrous.Steamed baby abalone with mee sua. This was delicious! The baby abalone sweet and crunchy. The mee sua not soggy. Bits of carrots contributed to the crunchy texture and the flavor was strongly abalone.Steamed yellow duckling bun with Nutella and yam paste. Was a hit with the kids! Some felt it unbearable to eat the duckling heads as these were so cute! The yam paste was too ‘milky’ in texture and this over-powered the yam flavor.This is certainly a place worth another visit, even if for trying out the lunch dim sum menu. Chef Yong has many surprises with his various combinations of food ingredients and presentations, that there’s no lack of variety. Pretty pricy, but if you appreciate variety and quality, it will be worth the dining experience.Wines by the bottle cost between $59 to $149.House pour $12.9 per glass; red or white.Soft drinks $4. Gin,Vodka,rum blended whiskey, single malt, $14 per 45ml.Draft beer $10, canned or bottled beer and stout $13Other drinks: Tea, barley, coffee, etc. between $3 to $5; $7 for orange or apple juices.Wheel chair friendly.

We dined here as a group of four after visiting the Gardens by the Bay, and I think it was a great find. There were a few other dining options we saw on the way, overpriced cafes mostly, so to see a lovely Chinese restaurant that did the lunchtime dim sum special at $28 per person was a bonus.The food came out very rapidly, as I suppose it was mostly prepared and waiting to be served up. Nonetheless, everything was piping hot, and delicious. The dim sum were crowd pleasers of course, but my absolute favourites were the pork rib soup and the crab vermicelli noodles.There was so much food that we couldn't finish it, and at the end of the meal, the waitress packed it all up for us to go.Highly recommended if you take the lunchtime special

After visiting one half of the excellent 'Gardens by the Bay' I decided to have an early lunch at the Majestic Bay restaurant after seeing the appealing S$28 dim sum lunch special on the board at the front. Once seated I was told rather abruptly that the dim sum lunch special was for minimum of four people. The menu also included a nice sounding lunch set for S$68. I did notice that it was for minimum of two people but asked if they could do it for just one person. Nope!I cannot see why these restrictions are imposed. Surely all the ingredients are already prepared and it is possible to order for 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 people. What is the reason for not serving these courses to solo diners?Decidedly unimpressed, I ordered two S$5 dishes and left. The fools could easily have got S$68 out of me plus a beer and a glass or two of wine. Madness!The whole restaurant seemed to be catering for the big tour groups that arrived just after me and seemed to have no problem getting massive numbers of dishes.Also, the peanuts that are plonked down on the table when you arrive are not complimentary, beware

The location of the restaurant is strategic within the garden and the place is done up in a simple and elegant way. Just like the food.During our 1st visit, the most memorable dish we had was the pacific clam hor fun, the salted egg crab and their soup of the day. The hor fun was handmade and the texture was so smooth and soft without feeling mushy. The sweetness of the clams just makes this simple dish so flavorful and my kids finished the whole dish, almost leaving none for us. As for the crab, though it was very small, it was very well cooked, so the flesh was still sweet and juicy. The salted egg batter was done nicely without being too heavy in taste, complementing the taste of the crab. Soup wise, it was clear but full of flavor, very Cantonese style of double boiled soup that is hard to find nowadays.For the 2nd visit, we had the same things again except for the steamed turbot fish. We were pleasantly surprised that a flat turbot fish can be so meaty and it was so well steamed that the flesh was still soft and flaky. The sauce was light yet tasty and we had to fight with our kids for a bite of the fish yet again.The service staffs were wonderful, attending to our every needs and nonsense, topping off the great dining experience we had at Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant

Our group had made pre-booking to dine in this restaurant after our tour at the Cloud Forest & Flower Dome as its in the same vicinity of Gardens by the Bay. At the entrance ,there is a live water tank for customers to select catch of the day for cooking to their choice. The set up and ambience of this restaurant with One side of the wall decorated with round mirror of portholes is a reminiscent to a ship .The service staff are courteous and efficient in serving our food. Food presentation is fabulous and it tastes great , but the prawns served not fresh. It is a great place for dining with business clients and families too

Despite the many bad reviews I have heard and read, I decided to take the plunge and made a reservation at the Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant on a Friday night. A friend from overseas was visiting and wanted some seafood, and I wanted to opt for something different.On arrival, nobody was at the entrance and we had to signal several times to the waitresses inside before being led to our table. Service thereafter was prompt and impeccable. We decided to have the set menu and each dish was delightful. My favourites included the lobster noodles and prawns. The dessert was too sweet for my liking but then again, I may be biased as I do not have a sweet tooth. The ambience was typical of any Chinese restaurant but because only five or six tables were occupied, it was not too noisy. I would recommend it for a business or family dinner, but definitely not a romantic one. All in all, I would definitely come back again for the excellent food

Horrible food and the staff does not understand English properly.We were served peanuts without our asking for it and later on they charged us SD 6 $ for it. Total frauds - inside Marina Bay Garden complex.

This restaurant located between the Flower Dome and Cloud Forest is well worth having lunch or dinner there when planning your visit to the Gardens. Great Dim Sum and other dishes.

We were visiting Gardens by the Bay and decided to pop by this restaurant for lunch. From their website, it does look good and classy. We made a reservation prior to arrival.We were greeted by a gentleman and he seemed to be expecting us. They prepared a baby chair, as well as plastic cutlery for our son.We order their chilli crab bun, and other dim sum. Food presentation is good but in terms of taste, there is nothing spectacular. For the 2 of us, the bill is around $90. Its a good experience afterall. We will never know, if we never try

Spent a really nice day at the Gardens by the Bay with the family. When it came time for lunch , we tried to eat at the Majestic Bay Seafood restaurant. Walked in and there were numerous open tables, just not set with cutlery. The man in the suit, who was the greater I suppose, asked us to wait 5 minutes. 15 minutes later, staff is still just standing around and no one is preparing a table. Typical lack of service we have come to expect in Singapore. However, we have noticed that when you finally do get decent service, you really appreciate it here

My husband and I had dinner here on May 17. We arrived without a booking which appeared to shock the hostess. Once seated we waited quite some time for a menu in a mostly empty restaurant. We had to ask a few times for the wine menu. We also asked for some tapwater which was refused but offered a small bottle for S$1. This is the first time we've had this experience in Singapore where even the smallest places constantly refill iced water. Fortunately the food was very flavoursome and enjoyable which counterbalanced the disinterested service
2
We chose to eat at this restaurant after a morning in Gardens by the Bay. The Yum Cha was beautiful. Well cooked and very tasty. However the service was NOT at the standard of the food. The staff (apart from the gentleman at the door) were offhand and almost unpleasant. We ordered 6 Yum Cha dishes and a drink. Obviously not enough money spent to warrant polite service! Very unusual in a city where everyone seems to be really pleasan
5
Had dim sum lunch with my wife after a romantic experience walking through the Garden by the Bay. While the food is quite standard, the location, ambience and the service are very good. I like all the typical dim sum we ordered. We ordered prawn dumpling. siew mai, cheong fun and custard bun. All good and hot when served.. love it..Price is very reasonable
3
Had some guest in town and we decided to dine at Gardens by the Bay.The good quality is not the best in town, but if one mix the environment and the location with the food. The overall package is not bad.The service was fast, the food is unique, ie coffee crab.While we were there, the were not many people, thus , its also a great place to dine and talk business over dinner
4
Well I did! Still curious to know whether they managed to find a nicer way to end the poor beast's life since not plunged into boiling water... Raw meet indeed, but delicious! Add some fried lychees stuffed with crab meat, and you get yourself an original dinner.A special mention to the Maitre d'O who provided me with patient and wise guidance on my food discovery trip :-

This place is clearly very popular but despite being very busy on the night, the service was exellent and super fast. Went for Business Team dinner with 14 people. Had two round tables. Thankfully someone else ordered and we just ate and ate. Chilli and Black Peppered Crab were fabulous but the Coffee Crab was a surpise hit. All the other dishes were also perfect. Great eveing and well worth booking there
