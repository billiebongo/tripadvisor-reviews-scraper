Food was good. Slice beef is very tender. We love the spring rolls as it is so fresh. Drip coffee is not as thick and strong as expected. Overall, it is alright

The chicken pho is a decent order; and lemongrass fish fresh noodle is flavorful and recommendable. Both are reasonably priced. Service is friendly; the table lay-out spacious and quite delightful.
Found the VIetnamese drip coffee a tad too strong.
Total bill: 29.90sdg.

Really can't describe the quality! Ordered the Chicken noodle soup, and the soup was just so delicious. Refreshing, flavourful, and I believe NO MSG!! Perfect!
Go try! At least once :)

Nice food over there. You can smell the nice pho aroma when entering the restaurant. They mostly have all the main Vietnamese dishes even the Banh Xeo which is really rare. Price are standard. Appetizer might be a be expensive though. Anyway it's worth try it if you are lazy to go Other famous vietnamese restaurant.

Food is decent but am expecting better since the price is not exactly cheap. The summer roll is the nicest among the few dishes we ordered. Pho is the most disappointing. It should be the heart and soul of the restaurant but I just find is average.Chicken wing - AvgCurry chicken - AvgFried glass noodle - Above av

Been a regular at NEX outlet and the first time patronising the Paragon outlet. Ambience was as good as NEX. Impressed.My all time favourite is beef brisket pho. I can say that the taste, quality and portion didn't disappoint me. I had the Vietnamese spring roll too. It was equally good. I must say that the 2 outlets had maintained the same quality and food standard. Many occasions, I've encountered different quality and standards for other eateries at different outlets. So, in this case, I'm impressed with So Pho. Bravo
