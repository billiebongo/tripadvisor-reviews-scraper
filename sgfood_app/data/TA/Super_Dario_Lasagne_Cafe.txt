As Italian living in Singapore, sometimes I get homesick.. when it happens, I usually go to this place and eat a proper lasagna! It makes me feel home every bite I take.. worth going here! Staff members are also very kind and polite

A regular at this lasagne cafe. Dario is very friendly, not so much of the part timers but their service are all good, even you can ask for reheat if the lasagne gets cold.Their lasagne is the best that I've tasted all my life! Definitely worth a try for the Italian lasagne authentic taste. But it may not for everyone since a friend of mine doesn't really like it.For a good deal, you can come during lunch time until 5pm to get the lunch set promotion.They also have probably 3 option of lasagne for vegetarians. At least I've tried 2 of them and all tasted good even though I'm not vegetarian myself.And this is probably the only cafe who sells truffle lasagne since I've never found it anywhere else in Singapore. Hopefully Dario will add it as a regular menu even though they accept $2 top up for an extra truffle paste for your lasagne :)If you've considered coming, just try it! Further reviews are available at the cafe, written by satisfied customers on napkins hanging on the wall. It's definitely a worthwhile experience trying such a delicious lasagne here! :

Short version: The best lasagne I've ever had, and it's not even close. The owner truly understands the craft or restaurant hospitality, and the food is consistently special and an excellent value. Longer version:My wife and I found Super Dario by accident when exiting Daiso one evening (it's right across the way). We had already eaten, so we didn't try the food that first night, but we took a look and met the owner. The decor is cozy and unpretentious, and the walls were covered with customer accolades.Some restaurant owners either try too hard or don't try at all when greeting you. But this guy had a charming confidence about him and his food. We were both intrigued and added it to our list of interesting places to eat.So after our next visit to Daiso (we go more than I care to admit), we gave it a shot. What followed was one of the most surprising and fortuitous dining experiences I've ever experienced.Coming from the U.S., I've had more than my share of lasagne. Some from small "mom and pop" restaurants and some from larger chains with good reputations. But here, in Singapore of all places, i had the best lasagne of my life.I had the Super Dario version and my wife had the Luigi Max.The complexity of flavor was eye opening, the portion was just right, and the feeling after I polished it off was that elusive emotion of complete dining satisfaction. Even my wife, the food snob, had to admit it was exceptional.We've also tried a few of the desserts and true to form, they were excellent as well.In one visit, Super Dario cemented itself as one of our very favourite restaurants. I truly believe it's one of the very few "can't miss" Singapore dining experiences

Was recommended by a friend to try it out, brought 5 adults (including myself) and a toddler to lunch there. The lasagne was rich with flavours and the lamb (Pixel) was fantastic. Love the desserts which ended the meal perfectly well
3
Was craving for lasagna for the past week so I just searched for the nearest that I can find. I ordered the Super Dario since I just want to try it out first. There's positive and negative that makes my review negative. Negative:It's not freshly baked. It's reheat. Maybe because it will take time to serve if they bake per order.Positive: Friendly staff, big serving, very generous with beef
4
I love their food & the man Mr Dario, he is just amazing in hosting his customers & taking care of their needs.I loved their Pesto & Mushroom Lasagne on my last Visit .See you soon Super Dario again...!!Thank Yo
5
After reading all the reviews good and bad I decided to give Super Dario 's Lasange Cafe a try. I kept my expectations limited, being from Italian decent, from Belognia (where Lasagne is a signature dish and no one can make a Lasagne like my Nonna and her sisters) #justgivingbackground . I was pleasantly surprised. Yes the lasagna is heated up in a microwave but if you willing to wait the team will heat it up in the oven. All the ingredients are proudly italian. All I can say is that my Nonna would have enjoyed the Lasagna and it is worth a try for all the Lasagna lovers out there . The Lasagne is light and I felt I could eat forever . Here is Hoping Dario's has the truffle special when you visit. Sincerely hope you enjoyed it as much as we did

I've tasted some very authentic homecooked lagsanes, and those at Super Dario actually could be on par with them.Very full and rich in the content, coupled with cheeses of the appropriate taste and fragrant. The only setback is they have to be prepared in advance and only to be heat up again in the oven (I suppose) upon ordering, which sometimes made the edges of the cheese topping to be burnt. But that's just me - I love burned cheese somehow....Still, even with that, it does not lower the overall taste of the block of deliciousness.I've tried both takeaway and dine-in, not many food outlet could retain their food taste close enough between both mode. Surprisingly, they can and I am very impressed.Nevertheless, I have to highlight that their iced coffee could be a little costly. While their hot coffee items are averagely priced, but they'd smack you with an additional $2.50 for converting it to iced, i couldn't figure out the math in food costing. maybe their ice supplier really double charge them, which I have to remind myself to just bear with the thirst and just walk over to the supermart right opposite for a $2 cold drink next time.However, even with that, I will still return to savour on the delicious lasagne. There are just too many to choose from.Highly recommended are their desserts. A little pricey, but a whole lot of goodness. Definitely worth the price tag. Although I won't say the same for their iced coffee. Iced coffee being iced coffee. nuf said. (pout)PS. yes. I am still very sore over that. :

Found this while walking around the mall. The food was so good. Tastes and texture was beautiful. The place is clean and inviting. The service was great as well. We will definitely be back... we nearly went back the next day but decided to try something different. Life's about variety right
5
Awesome vegetarian focaccia hot and delicious. Worth the wait. It is just opposite to Daiso. There is a small play area in front of this place which helps when you are visiting as family
5
Soul food, comfort food, excellent lasagne non ploy with lots of real beef and cheese . In a sweet little cafe . Friendly staff.
4
Nice lasagna at City Square Mall.... Authentic Italian Lasagna though iprobably wouldn't know the difference..LOL. But good value for money if you're a lasagna lover like me.
5
Is small, cozy place. The simple view doesn't correspond to the amazing food. Everything is made as homemade Italian food. The flavours... Delicious.
The salami as desert is one u need to ask.
4
The food was good but service could've been better. It was fast though. The waiters were sweet and friendly, but the owner (I'm guessing he's the owner) wasn't. Had his attitude been better, this review would've been better. The place was cute though. They had tissues with messages from the diners pinned on the wall
4
I don't think anyone else in Singapore offers this good variety of lasagna as Dario does. It's a small little outlet in the city Square Mall on the top floor. The price point is moderate so is the portion size. Not really filling. But I Super liked the taste.Worth a try
5
I had an Italian craving and came to check this place out. It's even better than the reviews and pics. I had the beef and pecorino, suburb. Warm, gooey, crispy, flavourful, filling! A light blend of garlic, onions & basil makes the tomato sauce unmistakably Italian, something you can't always find in Asia where spice is king. Service is polite and helpful, and there is free wifi!The decor is kitch, with napkin notes from previous clientele plastered on the walls and cutesy signs.I wasn't hungry for dessert, but They had a very attracted chocolate mousse... it wasn't as good as the lasagna. Sort of an ice cream meets mousse.Can be found on level 4 of the City Square Mall across from Daiso.Totally worth a visit

So we had a week long stay in singapore and we were staying at the parkroyal hotel opposite city square mall. We came across super darios for lunch one day. A small little cafe, with what was promised as being authentic italian lasagne. Went in and we got barked at by who i presume was dario (?). Asking what we wanted. Despite his abruptness we ordered at the till and purchased two beef mushroom lasagne. He has employed two schoolchildren as wait staff who have more interest in playing on their phones rather than providing customer service. Anyway imagine my horror when the male school child took out a lasagne out of freezer/fridge in a pot and started microwaving it. Not exactly fresh for the high prices charged at super darios. He said did u want it warmed more. Errr. Anyway the food came and it was absolutely tasteless. I am not italian but even my lasagne tastes better than darios. Also there seems to be lots of written comments on tissues hung on the wall at the cafe. I think dario has written these himself.Also its my own fault i shouldnt have gone into a cafe that had no customers in there. It was a sign. Stay away from this so called italian lasagne cafe
5
On level 4, we have moved past this place on multiple occasions, but never ventured inside this small, comfy and cozy place. And now after our first ever visit, we have been thinking, why did we wait so long?! We realised that the cafe's simplicity is its ultimate sophistication! Menu was limited, but I am sure every item would be equally delicious! The only thing I missed on the menu was lasagne options with minced lamb (would have loved to taste that!). We tried Luigi Plus (Chicken), Spinio (Veg), Hot Chocolate (drink) and Panna Cotta (dessert). The lasagne was full of cheese, soft, succulent and juicy; with portions being sumptuous! Panna Cotta is a must-try dessert! Super Dario is epic and worth a visit
5
Super Dario Lasagna is an exciting cafe where you can get authentic Italian flavors. The owner and chef Dario who is Italian, not only offers lasagna but also soup, foccacia, salad and Italian desserts. The lasagne are divine and original and taste just like the one's made by Italian Mammas. The ingredients used are of very good quality and all the meat used is halal. Being a regular customer, I highly recommend this cafe to anyone who wants to try authentic Italian food
5
we had the combo which included lasagna, tiramisu and sparkling water. Everything was perfect. the staff, the owner, the food and the wifi. difficult to search as it is at one end of the fourth floor of the mall but loved it after the meal.
5
Little gem hidden in City Square Mall! The owner of the restaurant is friendly and provides good service. Lasagna with an authentic italian taste.
5
Very nice and tasty food, good options for both Vegetarian and non-veg..
Must try, it is highly recommended.
1
This is a fast food restaurant! don't expect more than that. The place has no atmosphere. They keep lasagna portions in plastic boxes in the fridge in heat it up for you in the microwave(!). The taste of the lasagna is very mild. We ate the mushroom one and the mushrooms used are from can (they don't use fresh ones!). For me, it tasted like a very low quality children kind of dish and a certificate of excellence for such a place is a great miss
4
Very simple but nice place where you can enjoy the real Italian lasagna and focaccia. You can find different versions... also for vegetarian.Im addition you can try typical Italian dessert like tiramisÃ¹ and italian soft drinks.The staff, including the Italian manager is very warm...You can order online as well and the price is not high
5
Super Dario is one of those places that don't try to impress you with gimmicks, or amazing instagram photos. It is, instead, a cafe serving good, honest, comfort food in a marketplace saturated with a plethora of trendy, pretentious options. It specializes in lasagne, which it does extremely well. Don't expect a dripping heap of tomato sauce and greasy cheese on your plate. I ordered a tray of the spinach and ricotta lasagne for $49 which proved to be a hearty dish without being at all cloying. Layers of pasta interspersed with light ricotta and generous amounts of spinach made it a delicious vegetarian dish (yay for vegetarian options!) fit for a weekday dinner, a casual house party, or a simple meal that won't put a hole in your pocket. As I placed my order online, Dario sent me a text message the day before to confirm collection time so that he could prepare it hot for me by the time I went to collect it. Super Dario Lasagne is a cafe that just does its own thing and doesn't try to be like any others, and for that I am so so glad. I will definitely order from them again
5
Dario's lasagne is made on the premises and not frozen. He has many varieties to choose from including great coffee , desserts, focaccia and drinks. A nice little cafe with excellent service. Get there if you can , 4th level City Square Mall. Definitely the freshest and tastiest food in Singapore
4
Lasagna is one of those type of food that is hard to find in Singapore, and harder to find when you're on a budget and want to have good lasagna to eat. It's either you buy the frozen type from the supermarket and risk swearing off lasagna for the rest of you life, or hope that a kind soul would take the risk of opening a store selling authentic mama-mia lasagna. Lucky for us in Singapore, there's Super Dario Lasagna Cafe! We had the ricotta cheese lasagna with the soup of the day and left the place very satisfied. I would have given it a full rating if not for the cramped seating. The cafe is very small, so there was no room for our baby pram to move around. No matter, once more people knows about this place and gives it the business it deserves, hopefully they'll find a bigger place and get their full marks!Cheers
4
I won't believe they have 3 to 4 vegetation options to opt..we were amazed to see this small hidden place in city square mall..with the lasagne order some garlic bread which goes well with the main course..service is very quick and portion size is good for one person 
5
Having been in City square mall, we really didnt notice this small family shop. Running by italians, it would definitely not dissapoint us. The place offers variety of lasagna with different taste. All of them look great and the portion was perfect. The taste was great with sufficient amount of ingredients and the sauce was just nice. The price worth the taste and the portion. The staffs and the owner are very nice in helping to choose a right taste of lasagna.So is a place where you get a great taste and portion of Italian lasagna
5
Wide variety of lasagna with beef, chicken and even vegetarian. Chicken with mushroom with added topping of mozzarella is my absolute fav!
5
This is a little unassuming place inside City square mall and as you walk by, you wouldn't think much of it. However, it's actually a little surprise package! The spread of lasagnas is excellent. The food is tasty. Don't miss it!
4
Was my first visit to a lasagne cafe ever.. They have a large variety of lasagne.. Had the spinach and chicken lasagne. It was delicious . Good staff service too .. Look forward to checking out their desserts too on my next visit
5
Super Dario has become one of the favorite lasagne places for my friends and I! The lasagne served there is brilliant and definitely worth it!
5
Simply perfecto!
It is not halal certified, BUT they uses halal products, it is just awesome! Filing lunch without being overwhelming.
Just don't bring along Garfield here, coz I'm sure their stock will run out fast XD
3
I was in city square mall, around lunch time, didn't know what to eat, I went to this lasagnas place...Original concept...A lots of different lasagnas, good for vegetarian or meet lover...The lasagnas were ok, not as good as my mum's, but good enough...I recommend this place as if you want lasagna, it's I guess the only restaurant in Singapore that can offer such variety...No beers, it's halal !and pretty small outlet 
5
I went back to Super Dario Lasagne and I think they changed the beef in their lasagna. It tastes even better than before. I highly recommend the place for its large choice (over 10 different species of lasagne including vegetarian). The staff also is very kind which is not so usual in Singapore.
5
We visited Dario's last Year and it was great we have recently visited again for meals this year and it was sensational with a bigger variety of Lasagne,salads,soups the list goes on our food was top quality delicious hot and were very good size portions and great value for money. You will find Super Dario Lasagna in the City Square Mall 180 Kitchener Road opposite the Park Royal on Kitchener Level 4. Thanks to Dario & Luca for the warm friendly service we will be back. Give Dario a try you will not be disappointe
3
I got the day's special - the Beef Mushroom with Ricota Cheese and it was so-so. The lasagne will be microwaved for about 5 minutes before it is served.If you order a tray (6 pieces), you will get 20% off your bill.The tiramisu we got was great!There is free WIFI in the restaurant but there are very few seats. It is not baby friendly as there are no baby chairs
5
We strolled in with our little kid in tow and comfortably spent a whole hour on their sofa having broccoli soup, the Trio lasagne and a focaccia sandwich. The soup was the right consistency and my kid enjoyed it. The lasagne was excellent. My wife didn't quite like the sandwich but I thought it was OK. The owner, assuming his name is Dario, was very friendly and asked a few times if we'd like our meal warmed again. I would go again but next time I'd stick to the lasagne. That is definitely their specialty
5
Always love the service here and the food. We don't get much veggie lasagnas in Singapore so this is my fav hangout place :) keep up the great service. Will surely bring more frnds :)
5
You go by, and see it just like another fast food/mall restaurant, but then you smell something different. We order lasanha, which was very good indeed, but first we had a soup. Oh my God, the pumpkin soup is so, SO GOOD!! Creamy and well flavoured, with the perfect texture. And all of this while being served by friendly people, it was a really nice experience
5
Many varieties of the yummy lasagne to suit different preferences, and I really like their panna cota too! The bf's Aussie and always grumble about the quality of lasagne, but is a huge fan of Dario's so I guess it must be pretty authentic. Amazing service, whether by the Italian guy himself or the local service staff :
4
We tried the lasagna recently despite having walked across this cafe several times over the past year. Usually we had our dinner at the basement Japanese/ Italian family restaurant and then head to Daiso for shopping thrills. This shop has caught my attention before and is glad to have finally tried it. I choose the beef with spinach lasagna. It was one of the better lasagnas that I have tried in Singapore. Would bring my family to try this place during my next visit to City Square Mall

I'm not Caucasian and certainly cannot claim to be a connoisseur of Italian food. The young son has been craving for lasagne (not even sure why cos it's not something we've eaten in the last few years.. Lol). So google brought us here. At least it offered the son diff choices. A small cafe so not many seating options. Hubby had a great suggestion to encourage take-aways instead. Offer sweet deals like buy 3 get 1 free or 10% discount for 1, 15% off 2.... stuff like that. Otherwise if customers see that there is no seating, they might wander off. I don't mind that it was pre-baked given that the limited seating has to have a quick turnover. I imagine lasagne is one of those foods you could freeze n reheat another day. It could have been warmer though but really, I wasn't too fussed. I rather like to support good ideas.  Overall, this is pretty much fast-food; so don't go expecting restaurant fare. Thumbs up in this respect
2
This is a small little cafe inside the City Square Mall in Little India that only serves lasagna (and some salada and sandwiches). For the price you pay, this place is okay but the lasagna was far from the best I have tired. If you area craving for lasagna and you are in the City Square Mall it will do the job, but if you are looking for really good lasagna I suggest you look elsewhere
4
Really you come here for lasagne... nothing else.Lasagne is hard to get in Asia. Across HK, Singapore, Japan and Thailand, I have struggled to find a decent lasagna.This is not the absolute best lasagna you will ever have, but if you live in Asia, its likely the best you will readily be able to get unless you do the cooking yourself at home, and we know it takes practice to get good lasagna right.This is good for your fix, dont expect to be blown away, but dont expect to be disappointed either. Its also very fairly priced..
3
We went to this place on Friday night July 10,2015. The beef and mushrooms was Good. The chicken and spinach one was quite soggy. It's pre-made and put its in microwave to reheated before serving. The girl who's in charge of taking order was nice and friendly. Place is a bit narrow good for groups of 4 max. Located on 4 FL of City square mall just opposite Daiso.
5
Being a vegetarian it was always difficult to get good Lasagna.. I am so glad I found a place where there is amazing lasagna at a reasonable price! The ambience is good and the host Dario is very friendly and nice.. Definitely recommended and I am for sure gonna be visiting this cafe many time
5
Was passing By this place & was amazed to see Veggie Options on the menu which was a very Rare scenario while in Singapore,not many international cuisines so Veggie dishes on the menu.The host was just too welcoming & polite enough to convince me to try some of the veg option.I tried the Mushroom lasagne which was just delicious, creebing for something diffrent from routine food, i just landed at a right place to eat.Also the Tira Misu was nice as expected.Loved the hospitality & great food..!!Looking forward to see u soon Super Dario..!
5
Dario is a really nice guy and his lasagne delicious! The prices are ridiculously low and the quality very high. It's definitely the best place for a piece of Italy in Singapore.
5
This was a very tasty meal and wonderful friendly owner. Would highly recommend to anyone who wants a good Italian meal. One of the tastiest Lasagne we have ever eaten. Great work, Dario.
5
I felt like home! Great place for a quick work-lunch or dinners. They even gave take away. Buonissimo :)
5
Was missing home and after a short look from our local tour guide, he suggested this lasange place. As a lover of lasange, it came as such as surprise of the location but I enjoyed it very much. The al ragù di carne was just so divine, and soo filling. Will recommend to other tour friends to try the food
5
Authentic and closest to what a Lasagne gets. Tried lasagna alla norma, ricotta cheese and eggplants as I believed that if they could combine these two classic ingredients well than they know what they are doing.Excellent mouthwatering taste and want to make to order more again. Generous portions so its not easy to finish.Great job chef.Love your place and food.Graci...
5
Visited this cozy restaurant at City Square #04-17. They have many varieties of lasagnes to choose from. We were spoilt for choices! After much consideration, we decided to order the set meal which is $10.90. It consists of a lasagne, drink and a dessert. We tried the beef with mushroom, chicken with spinach and tuna with mushroom. They are delicious with authentic Italian taste! The lasagnes are filling and makes a good complete lunch with pasties as dessert. Did I mention that the owner is charming and jovial? We will definitely be back for more
5
Just had my lunch there a half an hour ago. It is a small cozy place which seats about 20 diners. I ordered a set meal which came with a lasagne, dessert and drink (top up 50% if it isn't bottled water). I chose the Super Dario Plus (beef and mushroom) with a coffee heart dessert. The lasagne is surprisingly moist and flavourful. A good balance of tangy tomato and beefiness. A slight annoyance is the mushroom in the dish. It had some cream on it and tasted like it came out of a commercial bottle. I didn't really fancy the dessert as I didn't know what exactly I was getting. No their fault though.What this place needs is a killer lasagne to stand out from the crowd, and you can bet I'll be back to get my hands on it
5
We have been trying Dario s lasagna twice. Those are great lasagna. And they are extremely affordable! Bravo Dario (the owner who is also the chef). First time we purchased 2 individual portions (vegetarian and beef/mushroom) and took then away (we could also have eat at the restaurant, a small place with a lovely cute decoration) . It was delicious, portions were very large (three could eat on two portions). You could easily taste the quality of the ingredients, fresh tomato, vegetables and great pasta. Great balance between tomato, pasta, vegetables and white sauce. Delicious! Second time we ordered two large trays for a birthday. Each tray offers about 12 portions. It was again a success, very tasteful, not too heavy, very tasty. Highly recommended, whether it is to eat there, to take away or to order for a party or birthday or just for a dinner with friends!
5
All lasagne lovers watch out: you'll be addicted to the many traditional and innovative flavours of Super Dario Lasagne in no time! I live in Italy and the lasagne here strongly resembles flavours of home, especially the one al ragù di carne (beef lasagna). The lasagna alla norma (with Italian ricotta cheese and eggplants) was delicious, too, and a good choice for vegetarians. Being in Singapore, there are also uniquely Singaporean flavours too, like the Bak Kwa Lasagna, and for those who want to try the ragù but don't eat beef, there's also a chicken version. The cafe has a cheery decor and the staff are friendly, courteous and eager to please. The lasagne have very reasonable prices and you can easily do a takeaway and microwave it for a quick meal. All in all, definitely worth a trip up to the 4th floor of City Square Mall (above the Farrer Park MRT) to try these authentic homemade lasagne

Amidst the usual restaurants, fast food places and shops in this vibrant mall, sits a bright little cafe call 'SUPER DARIO LASAGNE'! It captures your attention with it's play of bright colours, the impactful logo... and the name! How can my legs resist to go forward and check it out? So ahead I went. Was greeted by a smile and a little introduction of the cafe by the chirpy staff. They have a good range of lasagnes from beef to chicken to ham to all-veggies! Ain't this wonderful? I can bring groups of friends with different dietary restrictions the next time:) Personally, I don't take beef, therefore I am thankful for the chicken and spinach one. The presence of spinach makes me feel like im having a wholesome meal! Protein, fibre & carbs in a nicely-layered brick of freshly homemade lasagne. Yeah, best part is it's homemade right in the cafe itself. I always like the idea of freshly homemade iso generic factory-produced. Italian owner and cook of SDL is dashing, friendly and takes good care of you. Makes one feels at home. (esp if you sit on the sofa seat)Anyway, added a pumpkin soup & San Pellegrino Cinnotto to top up my lunch. The lasagne is awesome!!! Each bite is akin to heaven. I like the fresh taste of minced chicken... it's nicely flavoured and blends in well with the layers of cheese and tomato sauce. I've already decided there and then to take away 3 more home for my family as the lasagnes can be apparently kept in the fridge for a couple of days. Pumpkin soup is good and fresh as well. I don't rem having such soup anywhere else. I've always enjoy lasagne but you don't get a place which focuses on the beauty of lasagne like how SDL does. I am pleasantly intrigued and amazed by this whole concept. No longer restricted by the limitation of just beef lasagne in all other places. Thanks SDL and will certainly see you guys soon. Bravo!ciao :
