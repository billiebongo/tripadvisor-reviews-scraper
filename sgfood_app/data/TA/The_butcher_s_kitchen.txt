Several choices for the weekday set lunch. Food is tasty as well. The pork loin is also well prepared! Highly recommend!

My wife and I have been privileged to travel the world, particularly to Euope where we have family; we've dined at many Italian restaurants but don't think we've had better Pizza than at the Bucher's Kitchen in Suntec City Tower Centre.
Highly recommended!

The first impression of a restaurant counts for everythg. Upon entering the restaurant, we were told the promotion poster they had placed in the mall was not longer available. Inside of honoring it, they just told us curtly that they have a new set lunch. Instead of the promo set lunch of $15 nett, it becomes $15++. Deciding to give it a 2nd go, we sat n decide to try their food. I decided to try the shepherd's pie n was again told curtly that all pies on the menu were unavailable. If items are not available, staff should have informed the customers upon sitting them.A great disappointing start which totally spoil my lunch. Never ever going to come bac

We came here to try the flaming Hokkaido beef bowl because there was a promotion going on. It ended up costing about $12(u.p. $23-ish) each, which is quite a good price, for the location and amount of beef. However, just because it's for-value doesn't necessarily mean it tastes good. I thought the sauces tasted funny(it's a bit like mayonnaise-cheese) and didn't pair well with the beef at all. My beef was cooked well(pinkish) but my friend's one was overcooked - clearly, consistency is something to work on. On a side note, the drink(honey longan) was great. Service was good. The waitress(with a noticeable China accent) was very friendly and even asked us how the food was. Such service is rare in Singapore, to be honest

We first ordered 2 portion of steak on the menuThe friendly staff recommend a porterhouse which is just arrived in the morning So we take his recommendation It’s really delicious and worth the price !!!Service a bit slow but friendly Will come back again for a steak

Took lunch at this restaurant last week whilst waiting to Ho to the next meeting.Food was good but service a little disjointed - had to ask for toothpicks more than once and remind staff my drinks had not arrived. Shepherds pie was nice and tasty! Nice eatery

Had passed by the outlet for a few times but never get to try. Decided to try today, it was delightful!We had the pink salmon, chicken wings, pork loin and chicken served with teriyaki sauce. They were tasty and as what the server explained to us, they are really fresh!Price is very reasonable with prompt service. A delight! Will recommend and come back again

Was looking for food after checking in to the JW hotel over the road & stumbled in to this place for lunch. Wow. Had no expectations but it was really tasty. We had a range of food - pizza, burger dog, salmon, meatballs - I’d tried a bit of everyone’s meal and they were all great. Service fast and friendly. If you wanted to knock it, there is little ambience as it’s in a mall

We popped in for a quick bite here and just ordered the meat platter. The meat was ok, quite enjoyed the sausages, but not much in the way of veg and potatoes, they weren't brilliant.Unfortunately I would not recommend the wine, appreciating of course that a house glass of wine is never going to be smooth on the palette this was really not good. In their Defence from a service perspective they did brig out the three bottles they did have on offer, two white one Rose, none were good.Good effort on service, food was ok, but definitely wouldn't accompany the meal with wine, sorry guy

Stumbled across this while collecting the Straits Times run race pack and really enjoyed our lunch.We had the shepherds pie (awesome) and a pork sandwich, along with truffle fries and two lattes.Reasonably priced, but the main reason for the review is the shepherds pie, a must try. One of the most delicious and understated dishes there. It looks particularly plain with a small tomato on top, but is awesomely rich and very satisfying.For those of you with a bigger stomach capacity, you may want to order additional dishes, but the shepherds pie with truffle fries was great
