Pretty sure this place has since changed its name to Xiao Chu Zi. Food is surprisingly good for the price. It was previously more expensive when it was called Huang Ting. Place is strangely decorated but if you ignore that, the food is decent.

We ordered a set meal for two. There are 6 dishes in total, including a dessert. The food is surprisingly nice, with some fusion concept. And the dishes are so yummy that they are comparable to hotel restaurant standard. My favourite is the salted cream prawns

This place serves nice Cantonese cuisine. Two of us took the $68++ set package which has 6 courses - Appetizer with baby abalone, spinach soup, stewed salted egg prawn, stir fried mushrooms, e-fu noodles, and dessert (yang zhi gan lu). Surprisingly the food was very tasty and delicious, but not too salty. The chef is good at bringing out the food original taste. The standard is comparable with some of the fine-dining restaurants at hotels
