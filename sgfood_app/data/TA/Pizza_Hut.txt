Visited this branch at westgate Jurong and was impressed by the friendly staff Mary. As my leg was on a cast, she ushered me to a convenient seat. She also helped me to retrieve my medication which dropped onto the floor.The surface was prompt.She smiled alot and even told me to do a survey online to get a free pizza
