Its good atmosphere and ambience. Stuffs are friendly although not much variety of food, their unlimited supply of crayfish is totally worth the bucks! Went with dept and we all have a great time eating! =)

Flavour serves a good spread.
The recently introduced Fry-Wok of cook to order of crabs, crayfish, prawns & fish is great esp the salted egg yolk sauce.
Staff are attentive & polite.

Chic and good location easy to access by public buses. They service wide assortment of Japanese Sushi raw salmon and ;local peranakan nosh..
5
Range of food was good. Service was very attentive. Prices were decent with 50% off for seniors. My parents enjoyed the lunch buffet tremendously.
1
We came in this buffet after reading good review from trip advisors. We don’t agree. They serve you bad street food for high price. Fortunately the salmon sashimi was fresh... we won’t come back..
4
The variety of the food here is similar to many buffets, food, in my opinion, was really nice for a local buffet featuring some international cuisine. Plus the price was very reasonable. Service staff was very friendly and attentive, clearing plates and refilling water constantly. The sashimi was very fresh as were the steamed prawns. The pick your own seafood and have it cooked any 4 ways, was a very interesting idea too! Good for a casual week night dinner

Sorry this is late, been a bit overwhelmed with the past months to give time to post this posting.I have never met more lovely, charming people who look after your dining requirements all done will no fuss, nothing too difficult.We had 8 breakfasts, 4 lunches and 6 dinners at this restaurant. The food is plentiful, catered for all cultures, well prepared, and it was wonderful to see our eggs cooked to our delight on the spot. Dinner was great, the Restaurant Manager actually prepared a meal for us, we were a bit unsure about the fish, but my partner was very impressed and enjoyed his new food experience.The waitresses are beautiful young ladies, the waiters were charming guys and very willing to assist to make your dining experience a delight.Great english speaking qualities, wonderful with dining direction, experienced on the best sights and travel modes to make your time in Singapore a great experience.I could not find anything to grumble about during our time here. To Prasanth, Clare, David and Cindi, thank you for a wonderful experience and look forward to your dining qualities when we next return

Very enjoy and food is very tasty, just what we hope to eat the Oyster is not available. A bit disappointed but in overall, very good. May go again in 201
5
Our family first time dining at Flavours and had good and enjoyable night there. The servicing staff are very helpful and attentive. We love the seafood section that cooking instantly and taste very good too. Overall is an happy dinning at Flavours.

The variety of food is really limited and replenishing of food was really slow. I asked for replenishing of the corn sushi at 8pm and one of the kitchen crew said okay. However, at 8.30pm the corn sushi was not replenished yet and I went to approach the kitchen crew again. To my surprise, the kitchen crew told me that they are not making it anymore. It was an unpleasant dinner and it felt as if the kitchen crew was just lazy to make the sushi. The only plus point for this restaurant was the waiters/waitresses' services provided
5
Limited options for vegetarians, but each dish was made well and presented beautifully. Pleasant and luxurious ambience.
5
We ordered biryani there it was awesome with Indian style tadka...it was amazing experience also very kind staff
5
7 of us met for lunch gathering on 14 Nov. The environment is suitable for chit chat with friends. The food spread is wide and tasty. The standard of service is good.
5
Great service every thing you need helpful freindly staff great pool easy to get around beauiful garderns
5
Great service and nice environment. Food is ok too. Great for the kids... my elderly dad likes the variety too.
4
Price is reasonable. Service is good. Food variety was alright for the price paid. Spacious and not too crowded.
4
A reasonably good spread of food items in a pleasant and spacious environment. Quality of food is good and the mains were flavourful, especially the fried Hokkien Prawn noodle, the salted fish fried rice. As a meat lover, I particularly found both the char siew and roast pork excellent. It was a pity I didn't
5
We enjoyed every moment of stay here. Thanks to the appreciable hospitality of all the staff at Ramada International. The discipline and punctuality of the staff members are worth mentioning. Relished all pure vegetarian cuisines.However, a little improvement is required in the preparation of South Indian dishes Idli, Dosa, Uttapam and Maharashtra dish of Poha. Rest of every thing is the best. Care should be taken by appealing the customers not to waste the food by taking excessive quantity in the plates. The instruction like Do Not Waste Food needs to be displayed in my opinion.
4
Just had lunch buffet at this restaurant, food is not fantastic but reasonably good. Service is great, staff are diligent and friendly. As we have a toddler dining with us we can’t find a vegetable dish which is non spicy but the helpful Chef volunteer to cook some non spicy vegetables for the little fellow. We are surprised and really appreciate his help and I’m not sure if we can get this kind of service elsewhere. Thumps up for the manager too. We will surely dine here again.(Currently there’s a promotion on the buffet price for people age 50 and above.

Some months ago, wife and mself chanced upon this lovely restaurant,"Falvors" at Zhongsan Park, after doing some shoppinf at Balestier Road. Resturant was peaceful and pleasant. Surprisingly, not crowded. Food was excellent. We enjoyed the spread offered during lunch. Went back again another evening and had dinner. We were totally impressed. It wasn't just the food, that was good. The service staff are excellent. One can feel welcome and at home, dining at the restaurant. In fact, we now dine at the Resaturant, at least two to three times a month. Greta for family dining as well. Try it out
4
Good customer service with good spread and selection of food. Good value with pioneer generation discount.
5
Awesome food spread and service! I have came twice to the same place. I will be back there again cos we love the food there a lot!
4
Food choices were limited but stir fried seafood and sashimi were fresh. Most food were local delights and the thing to try is the BBQ pork. Durian pengat for dessert was real good but spotted some fruit flies on the honeydews. Ambience was comfortable too
2
hotel restaurant very average food not of great quality a little too much canteen style for me, most cold by the time you get to your seat staff very rushed. get them in get them out service, seem to concentrate on numbers of guest through the door, will I eat again no
5
We had our Sunday dinner buffet at Flavours. The fresh seafood options were excellent. The warm and cold buffet have plenty of varities. The staff were extremely helpful. Staff service was excellent special mention to Sankary, was nice to meet you dear! Keep up the great service!
5
Visited this place in July actually and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food on offer. We had Nasi Goreng, Mee Goreng, Codfish, Baked Miso Cod and Prawn Aglio. Favourite is definitely Baked Miso Cod which is soft and flavorful. Aglio was slightly blend to my liking and maybe not Al Dente enough. But anyway, this post is more about the excellent service provided by the team, especially their restaurant manager Prasanth. He was attentive, polite and professional throughout our time there and went out of his way to make sure we had a great dining experience. His clear and convincing introduction to the food helped made up our mind to try the dishes we ordered and we are generally happy with it. Thanks and we will be back
5
Chose Flavours at Zhongshan park as the venue for my class gathering (92 of us in total). The food was great, the service was even better! My favourite food was the satay and the prata! The service crew was very understanding about the big crowd, and they cleared the dishes very quickly. Would definitely recommend this place to everyone
4
A wide range of local food and those during my younger days. Good example is the satay and we even get to eat the mango soaked in vinegar. A must try to remember foods of the past. Also, the staff are very friendly. Keep it up Flavours and thank you
4
Although the buffet area of the restaurant appears smaller than other restaurants, the selection is fair. We were there on a weekend lunch and the place was relatively quiet. The usual favourites are the kueh pie tee, sashimi and roast meat. The satay would have been better if it's served hot. The staff are warm, friendly and attentive. The place is tucked away in a corner. Makes a good place for a small gathering of friends
4
We were a family of four and all had a main meal and drinks. Everyone in our party was satisfied with our meal and the service.The in house cocktails are interesting and may not be to everyone's taste. The price was reasonable considering it was in a hote
5
This is a great restaurant at the Ramada Hotel. The service was superb and the food was tasty. We had the specials and couldn't have been happier with dinner.
5
We dined at Flavours many times during our stay. The food was always fresh and well prepared. The service was fantastic!!
5
The restaurant serves good local, not so crowded and can have the waiter/waitress attention and service.
5
Loves the way the chef cook the seafood. Singapore zhi cha style. The buffet consist of various singapore cuisine which can have all in one place; such as rojak, bah kut teh and one the best dessert, d24 puree
2
food spread limited varieties, curry gravy not hot & tasteless, black glutinous dessert extremely sweet
4
Went in a party of 6 (5 adults + 1 kid) for a weekday dinner. Loved the quaint setting of the restaurant. Staff was helpful and prompt in service. Food quality was of good standard but spread was limited. However, the seafood station is a big plus to the buffet line. We can pick our seafood and order to cook according to our likes. Strongly recommends the big prawns with salted yolk sauce. The home-made Gelato (yes, only 1 flavour) was another big plus. Great tasting. Discounts are available for different credit cards and also senior citizens. Quite a good deal as we are not big eaters and enjoyed the overall dinning atmosphere
5
Nice atmosphere , really pampered by very high professional restaurant crew.In particular I would like to highlight the outstanding service of miss Sankary and the team care of miss Irene and Shirin.Kindness is a tangible asset of this Restauran
3
The food spread is reasonable. One can stir fry seafood in different sauces which is a bonus. I love pie tees and roasted pork. Salted egg seafood is also good.Overall a good experience and it isn't crowded that one can hold decent conversation without having to shout across the tabl
4
Very good spread of hawkerlicious food to choose from ! Indeed value for mnoey with pioneer generation discount 
3
Went for weekend lunch buffet in July when they were having the Penang Special. The buffet spread was average but food was tasty though nothing to wow about. Service was good and plates were cleared fast. I would say the buffet is a tad overpriced if you are paying full price
5
Buffet was great. Alot choicez of Food. Seafoods were the best especially the crabs & shrimps. Excellent service.
3
This is a cheaper buffet option if u r not fussy and just want to be filled. Simple food, nothing extravagant, no oyster, no expensive meat, just something light and nothing really that tasty.
1
Booked this buffet for my mum and following review am on behalf of my mum.Prior to visit, reviews online have been above average considering the spread of buffet and the taste of food. Feedback on the visit, the food was only slightly warm and not well cooked. Both mum and her guest visited the loo several times after completing the meal. Spread was average and taste was average as well.It could have been an isolated incident but this will be my mum's last visit to this buffet..
5
Had the father's day buffet lunch. Lots of food, sashimi is of great quality. THere's fish, beef, oysters too :) great service. nice atmosphere
4
Have a chance on a long weekend and choice dinner buffet @ Flavours at Zhong Shan Park. Greeted by their friendly smile and introduce on their highly recommended seafood by their staff Ms. Sankary. Love their seafood especially cook with salted egg sauce. Must tried their crab & prawn. And also their excellent services by theirManager, Mr. Prasanth, and staff Joe & Sankary. Overall great food, great service, great experience and a wonderful night for our long weekend. Highly recommended to come again : 
5
The buffet spread didn't look very promising at the beginning because it was tucked away in the corner. However, it was sufficient considering the price for dinner, which is value for money. We enjoyed the Chilli crab (it's mud crab, not Sri Lanka crab which most Singaporeans are used to but the Chilli paste was nice and garlicky. You can also choose the level of spiciness by informing the staff), kueh pie tee was a hot favourite for most diners, suckling pig and roast duck. The satay was lukewarm so it was a little disappointing. To top it off, the service was great! The staff were helpful and attentive. It can get really noisy because the place is popular among families.
4
Food was freshly prepared with a decent spread of local cuisines. And the best part of it? It had a special promotion for seniors (>50 years).
5
Excellent food value for moneyservice staff very professional...friendly and hhelpful..eesp Miss Sankary...she knows her frequent customers well...compliments to Joe as well..hardworking.
5
Lovely for a couple buffet dinner. Very fresh seafood and sashimi. Small selection but it's all the stuff we like to eat.
5
Food were very good . It was a very satisfying dinner however the icecream were too sweet.. Sankary and Nada were very nice and friendly when there are serving us. We were very pleased with the way their service . Overall , we had a pleasant visit and experience ☺️ Will definitely be back here again.
4
Location of Flavours was nice with the garden view on the outside (if you sit by the window). Not exactly a lot of options for the buffet, but it is comfortable and service is really good. Keep it up :)
4
Good spread of hawkerlicous food. My parents really liked the food and its a good deal with the pioneer generation 50% discount ! Good place to go to with elderly family members !
5
Wonderful restaurant to have birthday celebration. They surprise my dad with a cake as they know it's his birthday. Thanks to the wonderful service provided by Sankary and her Manager, Nada. Will definitely come back here for another celebration or casual dining. Well done! Keep up the good work !
5
Friendly staff, great flavours for the hawker menu, big servings. Worth it for the price paid. Will definitely recommend to friends.
4
Wait staff is friendly and provide good service. Usual local food. Prata is nice. Good spread. Only bad is green soup is super overly sweet when brought it up no apologies or action taken. I wlould suggest tt kong bak Bao meat be soak in gravy to prevent it from dryi up. Meat should be thicker n bigger to be juicer n nice. More Tim sum preferred. After all these improvements will be good. Will definitely good back again.
4
Good and cosy ambiance. Big tables with comfortable chairs. Good spread of food. Food is fresh. Great service and knowledgeable staff. Good value for money and discount for senior citizens
4
Excellent Breakfast and Dinner Buffet at Flavours at Zhongshan Park Ramada Hotel.Good choice of different dishes and cuisines gives everyone something to look for.Also good value for money so Flavours can always be recommended as family or business venu
5
Beautiful food, easy as we were staying at the Ramada Hotel, staff very helpful and courteous. Easy to choose from menu, staff helpful in selecting menu suggestions for gluten free options
5
It was our wedding anniversary so my husband brought my son and I to the Flavours At Zhongshan Park to have a celebration. Coincidentally, the restaurant was having a 3-day special menu for Mother's Day. The spread was good. Some of my favourite dishes were fresh oysters, prawns, sushi, sashimi, salted egg yolk sotong, cereal prawns, laksa, kueh pie tee, chinese rojak, mango sorbet, coconut ice-cream. They were yummy! :-)The manager and staff there were very friendly and helpful. When the manager knew that we were there for a celebration, he surprised us with a big wedge of lovely cake. Yummy indeed! Thank you so much for making our celebration a memorable one.We will definitely eat there again
5
Good tasty spread altho roast char siew was mainly fatty. All of us enjoyed the laksa dish but ingredients such as fish cake slices were not replenished 
4
Overall the food and staff are good and nice. The new Seafood Spotlight ‘Wok-Fry’ station took a longer time to cook the dish.
3
Stir fry brocoli was too cooked.Too soft.Mee siam was too sweet.Mee siam noodles too soft.Prata should include egg pratas.Beef patties were too dry and hard.But the Fried beehoon,fried rice n oyster omelette was good.Thought there will be assam fish.But surprisingly no fish dish other then salmon sashimi.Atmosphere and ambience ok n staffs were ok too
5
Good food. Entertaining waiter. Wish there was a greater variety of drinks such as green tea and soft drinks would be amazin

Flavours is a quiet restaurant at Ramada at Zhongshan . My buffet dinner on a weekday night cost $40++. I would consider the spread as small, probably one - quarter of the spread at The Line or Edge . It served mostly local food with a section for Japanese food. However , I enjoyed the food there as it was of fairly good quality . Some of the dishes available -: Salmon Sashimi, Sushi , Salads, Cooked Local Dishes , Char Siew , Roast Duck, Dim Sum, Rojak, Kueh Pie Tee, Prawn Noodle Soup , LokLok , Mini Cakes , Desserts and Soft Serve Ice Cream. I am delighted that there is an Expresso Machine with Fresh Milk as well as Tea Bags. The highlight was the seafood station where i could choose to cook the succulent crayfish , good size crab, clams, snapper fish fillet with 4 types of sauce - Salted Egg , Black Pepper, Chilli (without eggs) and Hoisin Sauce . I was too full to try the Hoisin Sauce but I liked how the seafood were done with the other three sauces . AmbienceIt is a relatively new hotel. The environment is clean , pleasant and cosy . I like the ambience very much . It is comfortable and not pretentious . LocationIt is off the main Balestier Road. Even though there is no MRT station nearby , it is accessible by bus or taxi. Service and Hospitality All the staff were warm, friendly and patient . Kudos to the staff ! Thumbs up to all the staff there ! THE BEST PART Guests who are above 50 years old get a 50% discount for lunch and 30% discount for dinner . The restaurant also has 15% discount for certain credit cards.
4
Me and my family dined in for a weekday dinner buffet and we enjoyed ourselves very much. The staff were attentive and the wok-fried themed seafood station was great
4
The service staff were good and knowledgeable as to how the food was prepared. They even took time to explain in terms that a child could relate to. The food was different and well worth staying in and having dinner
5
We enjoyed buffet breakfasts and dinners at Flavours. We stayed at the Ramada Zhongshan Park for 4 nights and the meals and ambience in this restaurant were excellent. The wait staff are fantastic. Highly recommend this restaurant. Particularly loved the buffet dinner with 3 hour drinks package. Anyone that has bought a beer or wine in Singapore understands this is not cheap. Paid $22 per person for the drinks package - excellent value
5
Service excellent Came here for baby's birthday celebration. A staff, Irene make many preparations for us and was patient with us when we wanted to make changes regarding the menu She gladly helped us and we managed to get a menu that was of our choice We also managed to book the whole area of the restaurant rather than only half of it because of the no. of pax that was available to come thanks to Irene, which was more convenient for us to decorate the area When we need different items for the decoration, they also gladly provided us with it Also, as we had ordered a few other desserts from outside, we needed to keep it in their fridge and display a few. One of the staff, Rebecca helped us to replenished the desserts when needed without being asked This was a good experience with Flavours at Zhongshan Park and will definitely visit here again 
5
I enjoy the food,the ambience and the professional staff.They always smile,helpful and very efficient.Keep up the good work
3
Price was reasonable but food was not really up to expectation. The quality and selection of food has to be improved. Ambiance and service were excellent
5
Irene Loo Asst restaurant manager was extremely helpful. She was kind and had lots of initiative. She was excellent! Definitely an asset to Ramada hotel.

Service is so good.Chef cooking is nice.All the staff very polite.Nice place to have dinner and wine, price is reasonable 
5
I have been to Flavours at Zhongzshan a few times already and have always enjoyed the delicious,freshly cooked food. The staff is excellent. Friendly and attentive. I love meeting friends at this restaurant because it is easy to get to and the buffet is reasonably priced
5
This is a lovely restaurant with reasonable variety and delicious food. Staff (especially Sankari) was very friendly and attentive to us and our toddler. Wholesome experience.
4
We had a great lunch gathering at Flavour! The staff are friendly, the place is cozy. But some dessert is too sweet and some food is nice only. The herbal soup taste not up to standard. Main dish is very tasty. Cakes too less to choose.. the price should lower a bit if remain same standard.
5
During my stay I had breakfast daily. It was included in my stay but I believe it costs $25. The staff are excellent and attend to your every need. Coffee is good and the food is fresh and plentiful. A special hello to Sankary,Cindy,Iris,Rebecca,Nada,Samuel, David and Jennie for looking after my breakfast needs. A job well done team.
5
Wonderful, fresh , varied buffet- with wine. Service was excellent. My waiter knew where Wales is- thanks Gareth Bale! Diolch! 
3
Indicated that I would be celebrating my birthday in advance with my mum when I made my reservation. Overheard staff whispering to each other that i would be celebrating my birthday when we arrived but none of them uttered any birthday wishes to me. As it turned out, it was the first day of the start of CNY buffet period (13 Jan) and the price was raised for this purpose. Unfortunately, the dishes served at the buffet did not reflect or factor in this - there were no special CNY dishes. In fact, the dishes were minimal and nondescript for a CNY buffet so the price increase is really not justified. What was worse was that I had made my reservation via the Chope app that highlighted some dishes to look out for and none of those were at the buffet! However, the pro was that senior citizens get 50% discount and this explained why more than 95% of the diners were elderly folks when we were there. Location-wise, it was near some HDB blocks in Balestier Road and it was relatively quiet during lunch on a weekday. It is a good place to visit if you want to chat with your lunch company and don't want to jostle with the usual lunch crowd in town.
4
Wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience even though this is not our first time here. From the moment we were shown to our table, recommending food choices, inquiring and checking on us and having small talks certainly says about our dining experience. We ordered hawker fare dishes and we finished all says a lot on the food quality. Special shout out to Mr Prasanth, Ms Sankary and Ms Shirin for their exceptional hospitality.
5
I love the salted egg and the staff were so kind and approachable. It would be better if there are more cakes to choose from
4
Roast turkey is very good. This item is rarely available in other restaurants. Other buffet items are also good.
5
Not much choice for lunch buffet but all are delicious. Staff are very friendly, very cosy place. Will definitely go back again！
5
The breakfast has a lot of selections both Western and Asian , staff very friendly and efficient namely Sankary, Jenny and David welcome you with a friendly smile and they take good care of you . Excellent experience.
5
We chose Flavours on the recommendation of a friend and we're so glad we did!The buffet spread was a lot better than we expected especially after the discount for seniors. Staff was most gracious and attentive. There were 13 of us and we occupied a cosy corner near the back of the restaurant. We had a good reunion and would like to thank Rebecca of Flavours for taking such good care of us

Dear Sir / Mdm,Good day.Last year, we have our annual company dinner at your good hotel restaurant at Flavours at Zhongshan Park. Overall, our management is quite happy and satisfied with the service and kind assistance given by your staffs. As comments of the food, we are a bit disappointed as the beef is not avaiable and food is quite limited as compare with the list given to us. But well aside, we are quite happy with the beverage (red wine and beer especially) as this is good quality as compare we had outside the other restaurant/hotels given the free flow prices you have quoted us. Last but not least, I would like to express my appreciation for the great help from Mr Prasanth Nedumpurath (Restaurant Manager) and Ms Jeannette Sim (Senior Sales Manager) who given us the support/kind assistance to make our company dinner event a succeful and enjoyable night ending in the year 2016. Many thanks and have a great week ahead.Warmest Regards,Irene Chang (Ms)Admin Co-ordinator KEMEL ASIA PACIFIC PTE. LTD.Contact no. +6779 1300
4
The restaurant within the hotel premises located along Balestier is a gem. Tucked just beyond the city fringe, the buffet spread is value for money.Much thought is put on the cuisine with seasonal changes so there's always reason to return for a second, third, fourth time
5
Very nice Restaurant with very friendly Staff. There was an excellent buffet with all kind of international and asian food. Wine and beverage choose was large.Remarkable is the service that is always helpfull and friendly
5
My wife and I actually wanted to try the restaurant's buffet lunch. When we arrived, we were attracted to the ala carte menu. Hence, we decided to order from the ala carte menu. We have the fish head curry, which is one of my favorite dish. The fish head curry come with 2 plates of basmati rice with yogurt. The dish is cook in Indian style. We were very satisfied with the dish, the curry was excellent and the fish head is very very fresh and tasty. My wife and I really enjoyed the lunch. Later, the very friendly restaurant manager told us that the restaurant has a Indian chef who specialise in the Indian cuisine. She and her staff are very friendly and happily go about to attend to the guests. Although, the restaurant was a little busy, I observe that the manager and her staff were not stress at all. They were very attentive to the guests. The restaurant ambience is nicely decorated and clean. It give me a very relax and comfortable feeling dining inside. We will definitely go back and try other dishes on the menu. Highly recommended
5
Choices of food were great. I love the idea of the seafood platter. It would be nice to provide few selection of ice cream flavours as I am not really fan of matcha, but I am a fan of Ice creams though
5
The staff was so helpful and friendly, truly the best we've had in Singapore. Food was overall very good. Loved the variety and the fresh seafood options
5
Appetizing food and ambiance. Staff are very accommodating and helped to make our experience more memorable.
4
Had dinner here. Nice and cozy dining environment. Food was good especially the crayfishes which were cooked upon ordering. Food selection was sufficient given the price. Will visit again.
4
Tried both the alacart menu and buffet. Food wise is okay. Good ambience and the staffs were excellent.
For buffet spread, you can pick their seafood varieties and they will cook according to your preference.
5
We went for the buffet there. The food is nice and the staffs are very friendly and approachable. We like their service and do enjoy our dining there. We have been there for a few times, it is a nice restaurant for family gathering and for those who want a comfortable place to rest and enjoy their food.
5
Staff were very friendly and helpful. We did not want a large meal and the staff were happy to advise and accommodate us. Good menu choices
4
Flavours at Zhongshan Park provides a lovely retreat to meet a friend for tete-a-tete over lunch. The buffet spread offers good value for its price, though I decided on the equally inviting ala carte salmon tataki salad which served generous slices of the lightly-seared fish with a yuzu dressing. I must commend the staff, especially Mr Prasanth the restaurant manager, for their attentive service which added to the enjoyable experience
5
Servers are very attentive specially Restaurant Manager Mr. Prasanth who is very friendly. We got a discount since we stayed at The Days Hotel. Food choices are limited but very good. We will definitely come back when we visit Singapore again and maybe try to stay at The Ramada too.
5
Excellance Value with quality foods; with a good spread of carefully chosen popular local favors and a right mix of complimentary Buffett for added varieties. Laksa is a must to try. Desserts Chef Mr Jeremy did a wonderful preparation of seldom found local desserts. ( please pardon me if I happened to change his name as I don't memorize name that well now at age 61
5
It was my 2nd time to dine at this restaurant and I like the home cooked dishes. However, I wish they serve more heathy dishes and lessen the salt content in their cooking
5
I was there with my family ( two kids - 4 year old girl and one year old boy) and enjoyed the buffet breakfast more than four days. The staff - Ms Sankari and her colleagues - were very nice and supportive. They eases our stress of traveling with young children and feeding them. They even organized a small birthday party for my boy. Thank you Sankari and the team. I recommend this restaurant for families. Food is good and excellent mixture of varieties.
4
Staff was courteous, service good ( empties were reasonably quick to be replenished ) and surroundings comfortable. Food quality above average and pricing is competitive visavis Orchard Road hotel buffets. My second visit with a different group within a week.
5
I was at the restaurant for a corporate lunch.Ambiance was great and there was good spacing from one table to the next to engage in private discussions.A loud shout out goes out to Rebecca, one of the staff, she remembered me and my colleague's name despite we only have been here less than 5 times this year. She went all out to give us a great experience dining at this place. We now look forward to coming back and being served by her. Kudos to Rebecca and management
5
I come here once a year for work and one of the staff, Sankary, remembered me! she remembered that I like good coffee and made a special effort to get me and my colleague a really good cappuccin
4
My friends and I had a fabulous time at Flavours. The staff who served us was friendly, helpful and accommodating to our needs. We are small eaters and prefer to share our food - which we were glad we did for it allowed us to taste the various creation by the chef. Overall, we had a wonderful experience as we were not 'chased' out of the restaurant though we did the last order.
5
Staff were extremely friendly. Our wait staff Rebecca was impeccable and the food was fantastic. Excellent place for family dinners
4
It was my first visit to Flavours at Zhongshan Park. The buffet spread was value for money. There was Japanese and a good mix of local dishes, from the different ethnic groups. The satay, roast duck and pork were excellent. However, many dishes were very salty and perhaps, the chefs could be given this feedback.  The dessert spread was good too. Lacking however, was the presence of dessert cutlery. These could be placed near the dessert spread. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends
4
We visit on 4th November for buffet dinner as a gathering for old classmate with a total of 25 person.This was my 3rd visit since 2015 for the same purpose so it shows how much we love this place.The buffet has been improve with variety.One much try the seafood where you chose the fresh seafood from the counter & have the chef to cook to your choice of sauces.I tried the black pepper & it taste good.Do add the beer/wine package where you add $18 to have free flow of those.My buddy all happily enjoy the free flow & they said it is value for money.I have to mentioned the team of staff,Irene the manager,and the crew member:David,Sankary,Susan,Sanchin,Dora and others I didn;t managed to have their names.With their limited staff and with so many of us,plus the other guest(From hotel or from walk-in),I can see that they are making the best effort to serve us well.And all the time with a big smile on their face.If I have to round off this experience, I would say: good food, happy drinks, nice & cozy environment, and last but not least, great great attentive service from all the staff
4
Service from Sankary was outstanding - very knowledgeable and took time to explain how we could best benefit from our dining experience. Excellent range of local dishes on the buffet and a varied a la carte menu option as well. Service was courteous and attentive without being overwhelmin
4
There was the pay 3 dine 4 promotion, so it was really worth it for us. My family loved the seafood which we could choose freely (free-flow!) and have them fry with our preferred sauce immediately. Take note though, that each table is given a reusable card to "redeem" your seafood. The card will be taken away while your seafood is being cooked and only returned together with your cooked seafood. The choice of readily-available cooked food is not a lot too, but desserts were delicious. Overall, a good experience

I was undecided which place I want to take my kids for dinner on their first trip to Singapore. The elder sister always insist on western food particularly Italian (she wanted pizza), and the younger one only accept Thai food. Since we were staying at the Ramada at Zhongshan Park anyway I finally cut the crap and brought the family here.We ordered beef burger set for kids for the elder sister, nasi goreng for the younger one to share with my wife who usually omit dinner, and Singaporean style sea food mee hun for myself with beer. The food came 15 minutes later and tasted exactly right - everything was so very well prepared and delicious. We all liked what we had.The quality of this place is everywhere in its ambient, the food, and most of all the waiting staff. We really liked the way they treated us. They made us felt we had a great time. Even without the 15% discount for hotel customers we would definitely choose this place again.If you are hungry the sea food dinner buffet would have been a great choice too

Enjoyed the lunch buffet. Good selection of items; especially liked the fresh salmon sashimi. Unfortunately, no time to feast on the desserts!
4
The salted egg sauce for seafood was the most delicious dish. I hope there will be a wider variety of dessert e.g. cheesecake. The service from the staff is also up to standard. They are friendly, professional, knowledgeable and helpful.
4
Good service & quality of the food was pleasantly good, especially the salted egg York seafood & Fried Hokkien Mee

It was a nice surprise to find a restaurant that serves flavorful hawker food away from the usual city area. The ambiance is quiet with decor representative of the history of Zhongshan Park. As for food, patrons are treated to salmon sashimi, gado gado, carrot cake, prawn noodles and cooked dishes. Special mention goes to the durian pudding and the roti prata which was made on the spot customize-able to one's taste. Spread is limited compared to other more established outlets but given the price, it is reasonable. Service is exceptional with attentive smiling staff. Children and elderly friendly. A nice change from the usual buffet spread

my first stayed in RAMADA is a coincidence, actually I booked for Days Hotel, but the hotel was full because they had students stayed there during Math Olympiade, so I got upgrade to RAMADA..Thank you :)And then I find out this hotel is very nice...the room is big, and clean. And I like the city view from my room. Our breakfast was in this restaurant, they have many kinds food, delicious, the staffs are nice. And its also a big space, so its convenience. And from here is very close to hawker foods at Belestier Rd, supermarket when you can get anything..
4
This is my 2nd time to Flavours, the food has improved, the staff are friendly and the ambience is good for fellowship with friends. And price for us elderly is good
2
Front desk few staffs found gloomy. Room serviced is excellent. Bell boy service remarkable. Near by park is very interesting. Transportation is very friendly.
5
Went with my family for a weekend buffet at Flavours. Staff were very friendly and helpful. They were also very knowledgeable about the food served. Buffet variety was fairly good, with seafood even being cooked on the spot. Ambience was cosy and even sofa cushions were provided. Very enjoyable experience
5
We were there for dinner and we were attended by 2 staff David and can't recall the other female staff name. The hospitality offered was second to none.Coming to the food, we had Seafood Buffet and boy the food was really good and tickled the taste buds.Coming to the drinks we could add on a $18 unlimited beer package to the buffet.All in all good value for money
4
The service was first rate! Our table was attended by 2 service staff, Shirin and Sankary. They were both very friendly and attentive. Sankary was also very personal and jovial. She also went the extra mile, e.g. asking if we would like the small jug of milk served with our coffee warmed up. We were also given a few discount vouchers which we could use for subsequent visits. In addition we were told that we would enjoy 15% discount if we paid with a credit card issued either by POSB, DBS or UOB. There was no complimentary car park coupon but car park is free for the first two hours at Zhongshan Park everyday. There was a buffet but we ordered from the à la carte menu. The quality of food was good and reasonably priced. The highlights were: Kueh Pie Tee only $10.90 for 16 shells; laksa - it had no cockles but juicy prawns, scallops, a whole egg and fried bean curd (tau pok), and the 24-hour slow-cooked beer marinated pork belly. We also enjoyed the desserts. We ordered the Pandan Tiramisu and Durian Crepe with Gula Melaka.
4
The food spread for lunch was good enough for a nice meal. For seniors it was even better during weekday lunch as there is a 50% discount.
5
Tremendous variety of both Asian and Western foods.
Very hygienic.
Omelette maker was outstanding.
Enjoyed each morning at the Ramada.
4
nice range of food selection. Loved the section where one can choose their own preferred seafood and cooked in their preferred style e.g. Salted egg, black pepper etc....
5
I held my daughter s baby full moon at flavours ramada hotel. The staff that attended to me, Irene is very helpful and friendly. The experience was wonderful and my guest love the food. Everyone enjoyed the lunch. The spread were very good and lots of variety
5
A great place for local fare food with great deals especially for senior citizens. 50% discount for citizens above 50 years of age. Most restaurants only offer deals to seniors citizens above 55 but here they start with 50 years and above.Food is good most of the times except some days certain taste of the food is a bit off. The service here is excellent. Cindy is very helpful and attentive.A very good place if you want hawker centre food but you still want a nice ambience and setting with free flow coffee attentive sevice and especially good deal
4
Value for money. Good variety of desserts. Like the seafood cooking station! The salted egg version was yummy with great wok hei.
5
As a couple it was really great to have the option of either a la carte or buffet for dinner - my husband wanted a la carte and I wanted to try the seafood options from the buffet - which included selecting your choice of fresh seafood (crabs, prawns, shellfish, squid and fish) and then the chefs cooking this for you in your selected sauce. Food was outstanding and the service excellent
5
Place was well kept, well prepared, clean and nice. The ambience is actually superb. Food is great; it has what's necessary. Nothing fancy, just the important stuff coming straight out from the wok and the sea that matters. Desserts are just about something that can be done better, but I'm not there for the desserts, so that skewed judgement a little bit - I'm guessing they are not selling on the desserts
4
The buffet on Sunday night was SIN$49 each.Huge choice of food (too much for one sitting)..I'd prefer a smaller choice and lower price
4
The service is excellent, and food there is not bad, can choose the flavor such as black pepper, salted egg yolk and other difference flavor of the seafood, after that ask the kitchen to cook for you, the black pepper tastes quite nice, will recommend to my friends.
5
Good selection of seafood. In additional good choices of cooked food. The soup was excellent . Good variety iof dessert too. In particular, the ginkgo barley soup is very smooth.
4
This is my third visit. I hope there can be some changes for the food. Overall food is still very good and keep up the excellent service
4
Selection of food was very good. Quality of food was excellent. Staff were very friendly and professional

Bread Hot food need more heat almost coldCoffee machine are a hot or miss at timesTea only one type English breakfast Better to get in the mall forest hot and what u want and cheape
4
This is a good place to sample seafood, e.g.crab, prawn, squid, in different local flavours, e.g. black pepper, salted egg, all freshly cooked. Top up $18 for free flow beer or wine. This is quite a good deal given the high price of alcoholic beverages in Singapore, especially in a hotel restaurant
4
Nice ambience and helpful staff. Buffet spread was attractive and price was reasonable.Would be more delightful with a wider range of ice cream flavours
3
was there on eve of Father's Day. The spread is average. The fried rice and fried mee Siam is nice. Salmon sashimi is also fresh and thickly sliced . But disappointed at the seafood, crabs and squid are not fresh. But service was good
5
The food, whether Chinese or Western cuisine, is excellent. The serving staff are polite and helpful, making for a pleasant and enjoyable meal time. The price is quite reasonable
5
Nice selection of foodGood serviceFriendly staffsGastronomicalNice ambienceRelaxingA must- try

2nd time trying Flavors at Zhongshan Park. At 1st glance, buffet area does not look huge nor impressive but I would say that the spread is pretty decent. You get some cold cuts, sushi, salads, hot dishes, noodle, popiah, roast pork..desserts, soup, porridge... Its actually pretty filling after trying a bit of everything. But what makes it more interesting is the selection of seafood (prawn, mussels, crab, fish, squid..) that you can self select and get the chef to whip up a plate of goodies for you, piping hot. I particularly like the black pepper crab and salted egg fish. Keep changing the menu and I am sure more guests will come your way...
5
Having great time with colleagues at Flavours. Good place for gathering and excellent place for food.
5
The new menu @ the Wok-Fry Seafood Station was too yummy, freshly shucked oyster, tiger prawns, squid & mud crabs was very fresh. Worth for the money. You must try it!
4
The food is simply delicious and i cannot resist to keep eating. The fried oyster and the chili crab are the mouth watering dishes.
4
We had our dinner on both menu and buffet over the weekend. The spread is more on average side but the live station for fresh seafood is excellent, meaning you pick your choice of squids, fish, seashells or crabs and choose the kind of sauce of your preference, eg black pepper, assam and the chef will get it cooked for you. It was very nice seafood.For the menu, we tried their wagu beef steak and their mushroom soup. Both are fantanstic and pipping hot and the portion is big for me. Not forgetting their dessert for durian creeps & durian pangat were nice too.Their service was excellnt! Their staffs were very attentive towards customers who are there and offering their help in everything. Their restaurant Manager, Mr. Prasanth is really ver kind towards all the guests, checking as and when if the food is okay and introduce food appropriately. He make extra mile to have small talk with customers, ensuring we are being well served and he is always full of smile. He and his team make us very welcome and we will definitely be back again
4
The food was delicious especially assam laksa. It would be great if there are more local spread such as prawn noodles and desserts
5
The food was great esp the sauce/dip created by the Chef!Wonderful spread...Service by staff was equally good, very helpful and willing to make exception for us on unavailability of card for bbq seafood Accounts Manager-Mark was very attentive to our needs.Very good experience
4
Went to try the new buffet theme with a colleague last week.The theme is " Hawkerlicious " and the menu was a nice mix of Singapore hawker dishes and neighbourhood countries local food. The must have international seafood spread are still there thou, oysters and prawns etc. It was overall a nice experienc
5
All food are good tasting with new set up plus seafood "Zhi Char".Staff's are friendly and with good services as well as attentive. Recommended to All Buffet Food Lovers
4
Love the fresh seafood and different types of cooking methods. The buffet food has a wide spread and food was delicious and tasty. Have the opportunity to taste different types of famous local food and the food is sumptuous. The top up of the food is swift and fast. The waiters and waitresses are courteous and very spontaneous. The welcome plum juice drink was refreshing and cooling. Will definitely jio my family and friends to come for the buffet.
5
For less than $60 per pax, you can enjoy sashimi, sushi, salad, seafood with different type of cooking methods, prawn, oysters..etc.etc. It's really worth visiting this restaurant
1
-Low food quality. The only decent meats are braised chicken wings & chicken feets
-Less variety. Less than 10 types of desserts, so disappointed.
All cheap stuffs
3
The food was average with some buffet item like dessert etc. The speed was relative fast and not much crowd.
5
We had a family dinner here, the buffet spread of local Singapore food is delicious! There's also some Japanese, salad and desert section which were great. We really enjoyed the whole experience, the staff were knowledgable, attentive and very friendly. We will be back!
3
Buffer spread was rather limited for Mother's Day lunch. And not really worth it for the price. .Christmas lunch was better
5
It was a celebration for Mother's day and it was our first time. Was impressed by the wide variety of local delights and the freshness of the food. Will visit again! Ps. Maybe have Laksa on the menu for lunch. Overall. My mum loved the food!
5
Very nice ambience for get together or family lunch cum high tea. I will come back again. Price is very reasonable for the variety.
5
Overall our experience is good. Foods is quality and tasty. All my friends like it. We will come back again.
4
Cosy & nice place, will be good if have more variety of food choices for buffet. A good environment for friends gathering. Very clean restaurant. Staff are friendly and have good knowlege of the menu and made good recommendation
2
We were there on last Sat to celebrate my Dad's birthday. I had chosen the Flavours at Zhongshan Park based on some good reviews but it was a great disappointment. The choices of food were so limited and the taste was so-so only for weekend dinner buffet @ $45++ p/pax unless you have UOB card to enjoy 1 for 1. I would think it was somehow over-priced based on the variety and quality of food. The only plus point was that their hotel staff service were good. It would be our 1st and last time there
4
A very good selection at the breakfast buffet.Attentive staff who kept the place clean, even when busy.Coffee machine frequently failed though
3
Enjoyed 1-for-1 promotion meal which is my 1st visit too. Will return again to try their lunch variety ",)
4
the food was very quick and tasty, what you should expect from Singapore's culture, would recommend for anyone who likes to try different foods
4
very good food and good service.
the waiters and waitresses deserved to be commended for the politeness and attentiveness.
4
Nice environment and delicious food especially for the fresh lobsters, crabs, oysters.
The price also worth it! Will recommend for friends and relatives.
5
The staff are smiley and treat guest well. The food is excellent!! Replenish often. Atmosphere is festive during Christmas season. Only thing is the aircon is a bit weak. Overall, a thumbs up experience with good quality food! Will definitely visit again!
4
This restaurant is inside Ramada. The breakfast has good spread of items which include local , Indian , English and American choices. Need to add that the staff serving WILL NOT SMILE, only drawback. Else good for breakfast.
4
The spread wasn't expensive, but there were certainly some items that were surprisingly outstanding – the beef cheek, for instance. I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but theirs are very good indeed. Only shucked when required in order to retain freshness, these were some of the freshest & juiciest I've ever had. Great choice of supplier. Because we went on Valentine's Day, there was free-flow champagne. I'm no expert, but it was pleasant and sweet. Enjoyed it. Overall, I'd say the buffet deserves more patronage. It's a great place for a quiet evening with decent eats. :
4
The service is excellent. The food is decent but variety is minimal. The dessert variety is minimal too.
5
We took an 8:30 seating on Valentine's Day and were one of the last couples to be seated and literally the last couple to leave. The food was above average buffet style food and very plentiful. The seafood was delicious. The service was extremely helpful and so was the manager on staff who was checking the tables and pouring the wine. At the end, the staff was joking with us and taking pictures for us as they closed up. Over all it was a perfect Valentine's Day experience

Was here for the buffet dinner on a weekday. The restaurant is located inside the Ramada Hotel, on the ground floor right in front from the main entrance. Just besides this new hotel is the beautiful Zhongshan Park (and the Zhongshan Park Mall), right opposite Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall Museum.It was past 6pm when we arrived and the restaurant had just started its dinner operations with about 1-2 tables occupied. We were ushered to our table by the friendly staff. The restaurant was brightly lighted, quite comfortable chairs and sofa, with some vintage décor, picture photos introducing the history about the place and area. The kitchen was open-concept and one could see the chefs preparing food. Quite conducive.To be honest, the buffet spread was quite limited (only a few main courses with the rest either salad, fruits and cakes, of course there were also some fresh prawns and mussels). So we decided to opt for the semi-buffet cum "zhi-char", where we would choose from the menu, a few key main courses and complimented by the buffet spread.After glancing through the "zhi-char" menu, where one could only order one dish from the main food categories, like Meat, Fish, Vegetable, Side Dish, and with the 2 of us, we could order 2 from each category instead, which was fine.So we ordered the Stir Fried Kailan (this was good, crunchy and not too oily); Stir Fried Prawns (well marinated and cooked to perfection and the prawns were fresh); Rendang Beef (nice and flavourful though I hope the gravy could be thicker and stronger); Soy Sauce Chicken (the chicken was tender and juicy but the gravy was quite light and watery); Grilled Salmon, Chicken and Pork (there were very tasty especially the fish, juicy and sweet); Stir Fried Fish (this was average though the fish was fresh). Overall these ordered "zhi char" dishes were very tasty and nice and they were served promptly.As for the buffet spread, as mentioned, very limited spread, and what was commendable was the fresh tiger prawns, lamb stewed that was well marinated and cooked. They only offered steamed white rice (usually for buffet, good to have fried rice or fried noodles or bee hoon instead), though they have soba, but the sauce was overly salty and the noodles were thick and not chewy or springy. Then there was a salad bar (and also the local salad version - rojak, with quite good rojak sauce). There was a meat Pao dish, fresh cut and whole fruits, some cakes (the chocolate cake was flavourful and nice).There was a coffee machine but no tea provided and somehow the coffee machine stopped working (perhaps its running out of milk or overflow at the water compartment) and this was not fixed on time. In addition, there was no additional fresh or hot milk provided for those who opted for normal coffee or expresso, something most cafes or restaurants would provide.Service wise. Generally fine and good as our iced water were being refilled regularly, and the used plates cleared. Staff were attentive too. Only issue was that when placing our order for the "Zhi Char" dishes, there were some dishes/sauces that we were unfamiliar and we tend to ask the staff about the dishes, but they could not really understand what we were asking and thus not able to reply to us (the staff had to walk off to check and returned to us with the description a few times). Later, we learnt that they were from China (like to be students on internship), perhaps their English may not be competent and so we switched to speaking to them in Mandarin and then most of the queries were resolved.It was quite value for money and if I did not remember wrongly it was like $38++ per pax. (if you go for the buffet alone, it would be $25++) So taking into consideration the nice "Zhi-Char" dishes, it was already good value for money as most of these dishes were tasty and nice. And the buffet dishes were just "value add".We did enjoy the food here and have decided to return again to try the other "Zhi-Char" dishes which we did not order this time round!!
4
Good ambience and attentive service. Not much variety at the cold seafood section, but various dishes for appetizer and mains and desserts.
4
The food and service is excellence. Not too crowded. Easy accessible and it is definitely value for money.
4
Went here as it was right by our hotel, food was delicious, we ate here a few times, would recommend it, nice little market close by,
4
Flavours at Zhongshan is a newly built hotel. The variety of food in there was wide and we had a wonderful time eating our lunch/ high tea. Highly recommended.
2
I tried the place just to review it ! So 1st of all we went and couldn't go in because we had the hotel slipper on wttttt !! Then no orange juice :/ I seen a guy cutting 3 oranges and squeezing with his hands ! Then food quality is super poor ! Won't recommended as there are a lot of places to eat out ! No Value for money at all
3
Not much selection of food. Hope to see if changes food when it finished .then it will be different food to eat. Will be great. Understand that change food is expensive but it will capture more customers to come and try. I think is good to try this method. I will be the first to write the review.
5
Food was really good. The quality was surprisingly very good for the price. Seafood and sashimi were as fresh as it gets. Really worth trying. Perhaps the only disappointment was that they no longer served buah keluak in their menu, but the rest of the dishes made up for it.
4
1. We couldn't find the place because it didn't mention the Hotel in the reservation by Chope which is Ramada. The restaurant deco was warm and cosy and had pictures of Sun zhong Shan which was befitting of the theme of the place.2. The air con of the hotel needs to be re-done. The air vent is either directly blowing at you or below you so it was super cold.3. The food was good and the waiters were very attentive. They asked for about your food and was serious about our feedback4. As a couple, we were small eaters, so we had just one serving of the soup - crabmeat and fish maw - this was a little too salty for us but was a huge bowl and therefore the portion was great for a couple. one serving of caesar salad with smoked salmon. the salad was fresh and the amount of dressing was perfect. as usual i didn't like the smoked salmon as it was too salty but my partner prefers that to a choice of prawns or chicken. He didn't like it either because it was really salty. the caramalised kung bo lamb was fantastic. they served rice at any amount you want. we finished off the whole meal with a durian pengat which is really a rich durian mousse - bitter sweet and would be too much for one person but perfect when shared among a couple.the manager surprised us with complimentary coffee and hot chocolate after we took a walk and went back to the hotel lobby for a drink. I would like to come back to try their other range of food in futureKeep up the good work !  
4
Had dinner here one night - buffet. Highly recommended. Nice selection of food - with a mix of local + western foods. Seafood typically good, though felt prawns could have been a lot fresher for my liking. Satay sticks were lovely, dumplings etc... all good. An enjoyable time here
5
Casual ambience but attentive service. Lovely Asian cuisine and the beer roast pork was worth losing count of calories. Chef was friendly and explained this speciality. The restaurant manager gave a sweet surprise (dessert) for a member of my family when i told him it was a birthday dinner celebration. One waitress was exceptionally smiley. I have plans to return for high-tea!
5
The food was delicious. The staff was extremely nice and attentive. Would definitely recommend the restaurant and go back there when being in Singapore.
4
Overall the food was very tasty . Ambience was very pleasant and service attentive. The price if could be lowered will certainly top it all !
4
Flavors is the good as it gives you a choice f two types of types European and Asian. A Bit pricy but the food is well presented and nicely cooked but for the price is not great value for money.
4
Very clean and well decorated restaurant. Food selection was bit limited but we enjoyed it having dinner and breakfast.
4
Have never been there but was trying to find a dining place at a last minute on Chope as most place are booked for Saturday. Very good service by the team and there are wide variety of food during the weekend buffet. Was impressed by the newly launch buffet. The food was pretty good for the price. Hopefully it will be able to attract more crowds, maybe with more promotion.
3
Service is excellent - the servers were attentive and friendly and also informed of various promotion. The manager personally introduce the menu and made recommendation on its signature dishes. Unfortunately, food was lackluster. I ordered the signature dish -Seafood udon which was bland. The miso cod was average. 
3
Went for the weekend hi-tea from 1pm to 5pm and paid around $32 per person. Place was well-organised and ambience was good for catching up as there wasn't a crowd.Staff was very friendly and keen to help. However, offerings were limited and taste was mediocre.Would go back again for the quietness but not for the food. Not really value for money until you value the quiet like I do
4
Had our reunion buffet dinner at Flavours on 18 Feb 2015. We reserved the second sitting in Jan and had 15% (with the ang bao special).There was a good selections of food; Japanese, Chinese and Nonya pastries.The service was good, with our plates promptly cleared. The children liked the sushi a lot while the adults liked the Chinese dishes. The teh tarik was a nice touch to enhance the Asian themed dinner.The cost of the dinner worked out to be about $58 per adult. Child aged 4 and below is free
2
Went for high tea buffet as I was intrigued by the concept of a Peranakan spread. There was a popish station, Rojak station, steamed bun "sandwich" station with fillings like kong bah, hae bee hiam and otak, satay/ gado-gado, dim-sum and cooked dishes like pad Thai, clay pot rice, beef Rendang, random other things like sashimi/ sushi and salami, and local and western desserts. Unfortunately the quality of the food was not great. The best dishes were the beef Rendang (tender beef cheeks used) and the pad Thai. Everything else was too dry or stringy from being out too long or lacked depth of flavour. Nice setting next to a small park honoring Sun Yat Sen (whose villa is across the street)
5
Flavours is located inside Ramada hotel, nice cosy restaurant, no loud music. Staff very friendly, observant and knowledgeable. I was eating for the first time in my life, Otak Otak. It's a little spicy dish, a dow filled with minced meat and veggies, great taste.At main course I was served Beef Cheek, one of my favourite dishes. I got rice to the dish, which I was happy for, due to the gravy the beef cheek was served in was also spicy, but not too much, rather perfect I would say. Worth a visit
5
Some lovely local dishes, and western dishes alike. Service excellent! Standard decor, very relaxed. Not romantic, but good food.
5
This is a great restaurant to spend a night with colleagues after a big week at work, the food, the atmosphere and the staff make this great place to eat, can't wait for my next visit to Singapore
5
Visited Flavours for the Friday Night Buffet with a discount when reserved via Chope app. Food was good with excellent service from the staff. Guess the place was still relatively new so its very quiet. Worth checking out.
4
Buffet dinner with family on Friday where they have Peranakan buffet in weekends. . Great food and great service. Value for money. Will visit again.
4
Had lunch buffet here for business meetings. Place was good and sufficient varieties of food there. Taste was good!! and price very reasonable.
5
We held a dinner party for 9 pax at the restaurant, as we had been there before and were quite pleased with their food. The restaurant had attentive staff, pleasant decor that was conducive both to talking and eating together. My guests enjoyed the food immensely and compared it favourably to other buffets, as the quality of the food was excellent in addition to having a wide variety to choose from.Would defintely recommend this place for an enjoyable party.
4
Having had a very busy day exploring the city it was an easy choice to eat at the hotel in the evening. There was a good and varied menu and the service was prompt and attentive. Although there were two large parties in the restaurant I was forewarned of this and it didn't detract from a pleasant dining experience. If you are too tired to venture out to eat this makes a perfectly good option.
5
Constant attentive waiters and waitresses; giving good feeling of best buffet dinning experience ever, A massively clean cozy ambiance, spacious and opulence - a good vibes for a nice evening. The buffet spread has what it takes to be sumptuous - not those range that you know are there just to fill the table spread to put up a show of quantity - just the right stuff, and they are nice and tasty
4
The staff members were friendly, polite and very attentive. The food variety was good but I find the dessert (pulu hitam) too sweet... It would also be great if the ice cream were in tubs instead of potong style :)But overall the dining experience was a good one and we will definitely go back again!
5
Service was excellent even though there weren't that many staff that evening. Staff were super friendly and very helpful. Ambience was great. The spread was not as many as other hotels, but the food served was delicious and piping hot. Two thumbs up for this restaurant!! Will definitely return
