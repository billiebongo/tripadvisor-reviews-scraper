Some of the food are really good. The japanese sauce is really good. Worth trying. Would come back to try other dishes.
Staffs were friendly and helpful.

For those people, who are craving for vegetarian food in Japanese cuisine in Singapore. It was not only stomach full but also heart full and soulful food there. It was so delicious and the restaurant for very clean and tidy.

I found the overall experience to be amazing! The food, service and restaurant was amazing. The staff was very friendly in suggesting certain foods to us and they were very quick to deliver the food as well. The quality of the food was exceptional. In my experience as a vegetarian, I have never gone to a Japanese restaurant and come out of it with a full stomach, this was the first time I enjoyed a Japanese meal and I filled myself up. My family and I had a lovely time. The only negative thing I could comment on was the fact that there was no dessert. On the menu, there was a section for dessert but when we asked for it, they said that nothing was available. Overall - amazing

Found the overall experience to be underwhelming; expected something more impressive considering the pricetag and the hype. Food was OK but hardly outstanding and definitely not worth the total bill. The mock meats weren't anywhere a substitute for the real thing and there are so many better Asian vegetarian restaurant options around Singapore to be honest.Service was friendly but slow
5
Never thought it's possible to get a good vegaterian japanese and was pleasantly surprised. I'll definitely come back with my family. We skipped the 'fake' fish and had more tempura and stirred fried vegetable, grilled mushroom, some maki and noodle dishes. Good fresh ingredient and well flavour

Finding this Japanese Vegetarian restaurant nestled in Sunshine plaza has been the best find in Singapore. As an adventurous vegetarian finding good Asian food is difficult. This restaurant has pages and pages of food to choose from- and it's all not mushrooms and tofu. The sushi's are to die for. The ginger and wasabi are so fresh. I have tried so many of their dishes and they are all really good. The set meals are a good option when you can't make up your mind. The desserts are mildly sweet and a great way to finish the meal.The price is reasonable too. I am here atleast once a month and usually bring friends here and have converted all of them to loyal customers of this place.Do give it a try - especially all you adventurous vegetarians and vegans out there. Can eat relaxed in the knowledge that there's nothing non-veg in the vicinity of the kitchen! Good food and peace of mind

A strictly vegetarian restaurant, Teng offers authentic Japanese cuisine such as tempura, grilled skewers, Salmon Avocado Sushi, Unagi Don, Tonkatsu, Paper Claypot and so on. The Seaweed Fried Rice and Sesame Ice Cream dessert are a must as they are really good and tasty! The appearance of the food is sufficient to trick the eyes as they looked "very Japanese" indeed. The place is exceptionally crowded on weekends
4
We arrived for late lunch and I think the resto was full so they led us to their other location that's a short walk away, in a different part of the complex by the street. That was interesting, but I was glad they still accommodated us. We tried a few of the Japanese-inspired vegan dishes and found these to be simply prepared with fresh ingredients, healthy, and clean-tasting. A welcome change from the Singaporean vegan dishes we'd been having so far, which can sometimes be rich with the curry sauces

Teng Bespoke Japanese Vegetarian Dining, located first floor in the Sunshine Plaza building, 91 Bencoolen St. This restaurant gives us a different take on Japanese food in a healthier way serving quality and refreshing food. Some of The dishes that we loved, Teriyaki Chicken on stick served with English parsley and pinkish ginger strips, The Unagi Maki, Mock Unagi ,and the 3 kinds of Sashimi, mock tuna, salmon and sword fish. The presentation and food sculpture was striking, Texture was smooth and these mocked sashimi gave a very good sign of how actual sashimi taste like. Last but not least, the grains, Fried Rice was unexpectedly scrumptious and every mouth came with a whiff of wok fire taste, Incredible, Grains were topped with brown sea vegetables (hijiki). On the whole a must try for all vegetarians, It gave me another view point of having Japanese dining in a vegetarian way. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. The food is beyond expectations
5
Unique experience sampling the variety of veg options. Never expected I could find veg Japanese cuisine but every dish ordered lived up to its expectation :) will visit again!
5
You'll be surprised at how tasty the food can be. When I was told to come to this place to have lunch, I was very sceptical as I felt doubtful as to how tasty can vegetarian food be. However, all the dishes which we ordered tasted really good. The vegetables were very fresh and the sauces matched very well. Highly recommended for anyone who wish to have a good healthy lunch/ dinner. The place is big so it would also be suitable for big meet-ups

Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday, we are pleasantly surprised by the level of excellence! Ambience: 4.5/5Cleanliness: 5/5Customer Service: 4/5Quality of Food: 4.5/5Value for Money: 4/5Our Orders:Oyster Tempura Set: 4/5Roasted Meat Set: 4.5/5The Good: Very excellent, we loved the ambience, and the quality of the food, the vegetarian Prawn tastes like the real Prawn, and the portions are simply generous!The Bad: Absent the small hiccups in customer service, overall we had a great time! Bottom Line: Must come! I've never had such good vegetarian food before, the Chef is really excellent in his craft, and the Japanese style dishes are simply amazing! It's as though the food is non vegetarian

Japanese food, such as the Green Tea noodles, was good but their bbq food (Teriyaki Chicken) was rather salty. Wasn't informed that drinking water was chargeable.Didn't quite like the fact that the staff had no response to my requests as I couldn't comprehend whether they had heard me. For example, requested for desserts to be served and the staff gave me a puzzled look before nodding and walked away. Waited for more than 15 mins before I checked with another staff and she came back saying the kitchen was preparing. Surely they did not have to take so long to scoop ice-cream and cut the mango right?But I must say the sesame ice-cream was good. Can skip the mango sticky rice
4
Four of us paid S$119 and we ordered 7 dishes. 2 weeks ago across the road I paid the same for 2 persons. Both are Japanese vegetarian. The white reddish is definitely worth a try as it is delicious and can easily catered for 3 persons! My only complaint we tend to order too much and my daughter forewarned me
5
I was so excited to find a vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. The staff was super friendly. My server was an old lady who just with her smile and nice words (in a language she didn't speak well) talked me into the special set of 7 course meal. Since I wanted to taste a little bit of everything, and not just one or two dishes, it was worth it for me. It was expensive but pretty good. All items were uniquely prepared with great presentation. Everything was delicious.
5
Happy to find a restaurant that serves vegetarian food in jap-Thai fusion style. They also have a sister restaurant serving Thai food at Sunshine Plaza. Service by the waitress was great. She was totally honest to tell us if the amount of food ordered was sufficient. All mains, sides n desserts were delish
5
I am a regular customers there... liked most of the food especially the baked cheese mushrooms, mock bacon .... A must to order.... Love the udon too ....My non-vegetarian friends were amazed by the food presentation and above expectation delicious food.Restaurant not big but very well spaced ..... Service is good and responsive. Price wise reasonable and restaurant very centrally located. Parking fee is expensive... go in a GrabHitch or Uber will make more sense....Go try.... you will love it

I am a life-long vegetarian and love Japanese food. Passionately. I do not eat any meat, poultry, or fish. I do eat dairy and eggs. I was excited that this place had meat alternative options, but was underwhelmed by the fake bacon I tried in the tempura rolls. I would recommend staying away from the pretend meat and fish and just enjoy the vegetable based options. They are much better. Overall, you won't be disappointed if you choose to come to Bespoke, but I suspect there are probably better options elsewhere in this city of amazing eats. I was disappointed that almost all of the sushi rolls seemed to have mayonnaise or cheese incorporated. For certain rolls, mayo can enhance the flavors. More often than not though, it ruins what could have been a fresh, clean roll. I ate two types of rolls that were recommended by other reviewers, and both were 100% fine, but overdone. Presentation was nice...lots of color and fresh veggie accents.The wait staff was very responsive and improved the experience. It was not too expensive for the quality, which improved my opinion of the food tremendously. Overall, if you are in the area, try it. It is really nice to go to a place where vegetarians can eat everything on the menu. Don't go out of your way to search it out though. Food was good, not memorable
4
Small place, neat and clear. Sushi, Tonkatsu, Kushiyaki, everything is made without meat nor fish but come beautifully to the eyes and the palate. Bring a Japanese there, he will be delighted as there are no such places even in Japan. Bring a teen and he/she will be full of marvel. The sushi (nigiri) assortment plate is an absolute must
4
Japanese mock vegetarian food which taste good, good quantity, well presented and reasonably cheap. Must try for the uniqueness and taste of it.
5
Love this very much.. definitely come here again..
Not far from main road.. easy to find.. good looking menu..
5
Running errands in the area n saw this place . It was after I sat down that j realized to my horror that it's vegetarian ! Didn't want to be rude and so I ordered green tea soup noodle with very low expectation . I was very wrong, it's the best soup based noodles I had in years 
4
My second visit, I came at about 2.15 and the waitress advised me it was about time for last order. Appreciate this information so I quickly browsed and decided Unagi VG bento. It was delicious, plenty and overall it was a nice meal. I wish I came earlier so I had more time to finish my meal. Price wise it was $$$ 30 for a bento and japanese tea. But it was a good meal
4
A nice restaurant situated in Sunshine Plaza so the surrounding office building is quieter during the weekends and after working hours.They offers a whole range of menu we usually get to see in the typical Japanese Rest. but served in the Vegetarian version. Decent price, speedy service but table to table is too close over at the restaurant side
4
It is always difficult to eat out when there are strict dietary restrictions. We came to Teng in our search for vegetarian food with no chilies. We did not try out the mock meat dishes and went for the olive fried rice, vegetable tempura, beansprouts and mix mushrooms. Food was tasty, portions were just right. The restaurant was full. With a larger group you would be able to try more dishes.
5
So, vegetarians and vegans rejoice! This humble yet amazing shop in Sunshine Plaza serves one amazing dish after another. I've tried many of their offering-(wow their menu must be 20 pages!)- and am looking forward to sampling more. There's a peaceful feel to this place, even in the midst of the throngs of Singaporeans bustling by just outside the restaurant itself. The staff are just delightful and couldn't be sweeter. Last lunch order is at 230pm, so plan accordingly. Hard to find a downside- maybe my lemongrass tea was too sweet? LOLSome pictures included. Wish I could take this whole establishment back home with me and even have them be the official caterer for every damn airline in the sky too!Enjoy.

So there were some dishes that were absolutely wonderful - such as its avocado sushi and also fried rice. Cold tofu was also good. There was also sashimi - which was springy and had sashimi flavoring - probably not so healthy as lots of gluten too. Service was so-so thoug
4
Very good food. We only had to wait a few minutes to be seated on a Saturday night. We had ramen and several delicious appetisers. There's non-vegeterian options in the menu as well. It is a bit hard to find, hidden inside a small mall; we actually found the entrance in Prinsep Street.
4
First time having Japanese vegetarian and found it tasty and well presented. And worth the 30 minute wait on a very busy weekend. Definitely will be coming back and a bit more educated on the type of dishes to order. We were all over the map trying all the top performing dishes, (including unagi roll, tomato spring roll, Japanese yam, and deep fried shitake mushroom with cream). Next time we'll just focus on fewer dishes ... starting with the avocado maki roll (which is in one of the attached pictures by a prior patron).Looks like Teng has expanded in floor space using another enclosed dining space across the hall way for flow over. Tables and chairs also populate the hallway too. For first timers, remember that this place is on the ground floor inside the Sunshine Plaza. The main dining area is a bit tight with seating fairly close to one another. We had to wait 30 minutes for a table as it was a busy weekend. Best to call ahead for reservations.And if you're vegetarian, there is also a Thai vegetarian restaurant called Pepper Jade right around the corner in the same plaza. (I'm think that these two restaurants are related based on furniture and being vegetarian, but just a first impression.) And down the hallway is a most excellent home-made ice cream shop, call "Zero". (Actually, there are lots of well written up restaurants (including curry puffs et al) in this Sunshine Plaza, so worth a visit ... and come hungry
5
I visited this place twice in last two years and could see the menu grew a lot. Much more choices not only sushi and sashimi. Great teriyaki, fried rice and eggplant in miso. Absolute must for all, not only vegetarians.
5
Really good presentation and substance. Especially love the tomato spring roll which is filled with pizza-like fillings. Cheesy mushrooms and avocardo maki are our top favourites. The sets are quite big portion so you may want to consider sharing with another person.
3
The ambience is good, the hygiene and service is excellent. Chief waitress gives good advice on what to order and quantity to order. Taste of food is fresh and food presentation looks non-vegetarian:)
3
Food is good.
Value is std.
Ambience is std.
Service is not up to scratch.
If you are lucky, you may be greeted by the only wait staff who actually smile!
1
A very Bad ventilation system, smell full of strong cooking oil from their kitchen to the dining area when we just step into the restaurant.
5
This is a mid range dining place, the staff is very courteous and the best part is they recommend the dishes which are typically liked by the respective nationalities We tried the following dishes:-Kaki Udon (Very yummy soup dish)Deep fried shitake mushrooms with cream (One of the best appetizer)Mix veg Tempura ( an excellent innovative dish)Fried Rice (Very good)Chicken / Mushroom with bean sauce (Good dish
4
I'm not a vegan but I like their food. Cheese mushroom is tasty, mushroom with cheese seems like a good combination. Cold noodle is good too, light and freshening soup. Lastly, the vegan sashimi. It's not like the real sashimi, luckily. I feel so much healthier eating this sashimi. Wondering how they make it. Hopefully no coloring.
4
So happened to came to this place. It doesn't merely serve vegetarian sushi, it also has hot pot, soba and ramen, as well as desserts.Taste fairly authentic and close to real sashimi and sushi, also the taste of soup for paper hot pot is good.Very refreshing

Teng Bespoke Vegetarian was a chance discovery. Even though it is situated in a relatively run-down mall, I was very happy I had dinner there. Smiling and helpful staff, a very wide selection to choose from (hot, cold, raw, cooked...) and service was quick.The food was authentically Japanese and I have never been offered so many choices. Of particular mention : Avocado Maki, Kaki Udon, Teriyaki Chicken and Inari Sushi. This place labels itself to be "Strictly Vegetarian" and lives up to it. They also have a private dining room for a large party. I also liked that the cooking style is healthy and the options included less oily dishes as well. Not impressed with their desserts.A little noisy though. I liked the zen feeling of this cosy restaurant. I have a feeling this will soon become a favourite for me

I have been frequenting this little japanese eatery and have never been disappointed. The shopping complex its situated in is run down and the ambience in the restaurant is average but don't let that put you off. The daikon salad, avocado maki and stuffed mushrooms are enough reason to come back. Excellent service and yummy food at reasonable prices. What more can one ask for?My favourite, hands down! I just wish this place was roomier with some sort of view...
3
The mock sashimi tasted pretty much like the real thing! It was interesting! The rest of the dishes were fine. The place was very packed at peak lunch hour on a weekend. Hence, booking should be made if you really want to secure a place.

After reading really good reviews of Teng Bespoke, we decided to go for dinner on a weekday. We walked in without reservations and were lucky to find a spot - it got occupied really quick after. The menu is exhaustive and having not really tried Japanese food before, we were confused and spoiled for choice. Inky Pinky Pinky did the trick - we got the Avocado Maki (was creamy on top from the avocado and the rice was nice and chewy); Veg Tempura (crisp and light), Chicken Teriyaki (chewy and flavourful), Black Cod (texture was like mashed plantains over eggplant, was okay), King Mushroom (nice texture but the sauce could've seeped into the mushrooms a lot more). The highlight was the Black Sesame ice cream - it was creamy and delicious, a perfect finish to a flavourful meal.The ambiance is pretty casual, prices are reasonable, and the service is friendly. We'd definitely go back, just to try out the so many other yummy sounding things on the menu
5
I highly recommend this restaurant for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Teng Bespoke has an extensive menu, which has an amazing variety of dishes. My partner and I ordered some mock-fish sashimi, which was quite nice, the smoked 'duck' and mushroom dish, which was amazing and an eggplant miso dish, which was heaven. The meal cost us around $45 from memory but everything was well-served and delicious. The service was also excellent and despite being in a slightly run-down mall, the restaurant itself had a lovely atmosphere
4
This is the 2nd time to Japanese vegetarian restaurant, the 1st one that I went was closer few years ago. I used to saw only 1 shop space for this restaurant and now it expanded to 3 shop spaces but all at the same building different corner, this means it has it fans and hence expanded good.Food - I tried maki, tempura, hot pot, and some side dishes. Generally quite good, so far no complain from most of us. A friend of mine who had hot soba said that his is not great. So guess I will avoid that in future.Price - middle range price, similar to those normal Japanese restaurant. It you ordered a lot of side dishes, you bill will pile up.Environment - nice for gathering, environment is quite good. Not vey far from MRT but kind of away from crowd
4
So, my vegetarian friends don't like Japanese food for obvious reasons. They have never tried Sushi, hotpot etc. This place offers variety of food made with vegetarian ingredients. Sushi tasted almost like the original ones. Pros: It is decent, not so expensive, have good menu.Cons: Have to reserve a table, it is located inside a mall next to hobby and printing shops, not facing the road
4
Small, cosy japanese vegetarian restaurant. It is located inside Sunshine plaza which is an odd mall nearly deserted in the evening. Don't be put off by closed shops, just walk inside, restaurant is there. I tried hijiki, kailaan in sesame sauce, kappa maki and avocado maki. Makis were ok, hijiki and especially kailaan heavenly. Friendly service. Price moderate
4
I have never tasted vegetarian food like those served in this restaurant. It gives me a different view of vegetarian food. Good presentation and very tasty. Good ambience and the place to go for a cosy meal or even a celebration. You have to make advance reservation if you want a private room
5
I have been a full time vegetarian for about half a year and my children just recent 2 months. The hardest for us is to forgo Japanese Crusine especially Sashimi.These sashimi we ate here tasted so great! They were not mocked with flour but tender and chewy. Really taste fresh and nice. Could not tell what they were made of though.The cold green tea noodles and hot soup soba were delicious. My daughter liked the fried prawn but personally, I thought the batter was too thick and not like the Japanese version (light and crispy) so more local instead. I loved their attentive and great service!As for the prices, good serving size for small eater, big eater might need 2servings.Green tea noodles - $10 per bowl3kind sashimi - $19Soba -$10Fried prawn - $8 (about 5pcs, made of flour)There is 10%service charge and 7%GS
4
We think this restaurant serves delicious vegetarian Japanese food especially for people converting to vegetarian like us. We found the sushi, maki and sashimi here taste even better than the original with real fish (as there is no raw fish smell ) and the texture is as fine as those serve in expensive restaurant. The serving of maki is big so as the side dishes, good value for food. Overall good service and atmosphere with good food
5
As a new vegetarian, I can't deny that many meals leave me missing the taste of meat. However, I'm back here frequently because I never leave Teng Bespoke with that feeling. The meals here are savory and satisfying, even my non vegetarian boyfriend loves the Tonkatsu Don (mock pork cutlet). There is a nice range of prices and variety, enough that I could (and sometimes do) eat here several times a week. If you're going out with non veg friends, this is definitely a place where they will still find happiness
4
The food here is pretty good, just the wait that is pretty unbearable sometimes. Unagi Sushi, Cheese Shiitake is the dish that we must order everytime we go.
4
I'm not vegetarian but I really enjoyed the food they served. Everything we have tried was very good. The atmosphere inside the restaurant is warmy (even if it is located in a mall), portions were big and it was not very expensive (80SG$ for 3).
5
We came across this place quite accidentally, but we were looking for a veg Japanese restaurant for quite some time.and this came a s a pleasant experience........looking forward to the next visit already.
5
Ate here twice on a recent stay. All the food is vegetarian and everything I had was really good. Staff were friendly and it wasn't very expensive. Would love to go back again!

I have never experienced Japanese Vegetarian dining. With all the fresh seafood produce involved in Japanese mainstream dining, I never thought a good Japanese Vegetarian dining experience could be experienced. I was wrong. The food was so good, I promise to have more of my lunch meetings at this restaurants. There are two seating areas for this restaurant, with two separate entrances. I recommend the entrance from the street -- and not the one inside the shopping centre. Not only is it quieter, it also fronts some very impressive buildings -- and the seating arrangement is less cramped and its brighter. Portions are quite substantial here. The tempura is superb with light crunchy batter. The "Chicken" or "meat" substitutes were cleverly done -- not the usual gluten filled mock duck and mock meats that we get in traditional Chinese vegetarian. The "meat" here is light and extremely delicious. I tasted a tinge of yam and sweet potatoes and perhaps pumpkin in them. Really delicious. Highly recommended. Will make the ominovore in you turn vegetarian

Finally, a cuisine that has usually been a disappointment for Vegetarians is here! Teng Bespoke is a smallish restaurant in a crowded part of the city. When you finally find it, it is well worth the effort!Neatly laid out tables, in pleasant colors, with a typical Japanese atmosphere, the restaurant is inviting.We were a group of five. We were assigned a nice corner table, with just enough space to squeeze into.They gave us a large hard covered Menu which showed pictures of the dishes available. We ordered avocado maki, squid, green tea noodles, lotus root tempura, smoked duck and fried tofu. A couple of other dishes on the menu were not available. The dishes were well presented, as shown on the menu, tasty and fresh. We were disappointed that not all dessert items listed were available and so settled for mango pudding, green tea ice cream and black sesame ice cream. They didn't disappoint. In general, the entire experience was satisfying and I would recommend the restaurant to both vegetarians and non- vegetarians.Just remember to book ahead as the places get filled up fast, particularly at lunch time. We were there for lunch and so do not know about dinner. But we certainly plan to go again soon
4
We booked this restaurant for lunch to celebrate Mother's day. They actually have 2-3 different shop spaces within the building but shared the same kitchen. It is very crowded, probably due to Mother's day. We waited for up to 1.5 hours for the set meals to arrived. The presentation of the food is fantastic and appetizing. you could hardly tell that the unagi, pork cutlets are actually vegeterian. I love the avocado sushi and shitake mushrooms. The whole experience could be made better by having better air conditioning, and child friendly tables
4
I have visited this place several times since it is walking distance from where I teach. The bento-combo is the way to go if you are hungry. Their soups: kake udon and green tea are fabulous. The bento combo $18 bucks plus service fee. Rather expensive but I still come here since I find the place and food clean and refreshing. Although, I would hope that they would start using brown rice for their nigiri rolls
5
Had lunch with a friend. The food was not only good to look at but delicious. Service was impeccable. I had the salmon avocado sushi which was beautifully done. The avocado was soft and creamy and the taste is just like real sushi. We also the cold noodle and the grilled mushrooms in teriyaki sauce, another winner. We were a little greedy and ordered the mushroom cheese tempura. By then I was really full. The trouble is that they don't have half portions so unless you come in a party of 3 or more you have to save your stomach and come back next time. Excellent vegetarian place
