It used to be the best place to eat black pepper crabs. The service has always been harsh and too local but the prices made up for it. The prices now have gone to the roof. Last time eating there.

We only ordered black pepper crab and mee goreng. Both taste ok and nice. Hair a note that The crab is not the big size of crabs. The food is served fast. When we were there, service is good
4
Much better than JUMBO, Long Beach.
Reasonable price but only take cash.
Must try black pepper crab.

I called in at the shop number @ 64405560 to order for takeaway at around 6:15pm. The Aunty who answered the call was very helpful & friendly (unlike what the other reviews claiming bad attitude etc...). I ordered a medium sized crab around 800g (they are selling the crabs at $75/kg) & a Small mee goreng (ard $10?), I was told by the Aunty to collect the items before 8:30pm. I reached around 8:35pm and the Aunty saw me & happily directed me to collect my order. Nice breezy Coffeeshop located at a corner of the main joo Chiat road, old school feel, not very clean but still ok.Overall I love the food and the people who served me.The black pepper crab taste so good because they cook the crabs with butter/ghee as I can see from the outer layer surrounding the black pepper sauce there is a yellow oil sauce that taste buttery..... the crabs are extremely fresh.Please go to this place if you love BLACK PEPPER CRAB

It appears that the cruise line standards are definitely on the decline we cruise fairly frequently and have been terribly dissapointed on our last two cruises which which i may add were with different cruise lines. Maybe because they have now created a captive audience they believe they have the right to drop their standards in search of increased profits. We have recently done the New Year cruise out of Singapore. The ship is badly in need of an overhaul , the air conditioning in our stateroom was totally useless and I assume many more cabins in other areas, opening the balcony door to try and get a breeze a waist of time as the air outside was even hotter. Getting hot or cold water in shower and basin proved to be impossible, when you needed hot it was cold and vice versa. The ship developed a sewerage smell in some of the public areas which I am led to believe they could not contain. We utilised the Martini bar for our relaxation time and other than bar person Gabriella who was fantastic the rest were, to put it mildly, absolutely useless !!! Had no idea about the cocktail menu could hardly speak or understand English at times we had to write our orders down. The food was pretty pretty, average across the board though the dining staff Maîtres and table staff were exceptionally pleasant efficient and helpful. We went to the Stirling steak on New years eve without going into detail the steaks were so bad we were obliged to send them back you could have resoled your shoes with mine and never wear them out. The manager apologized and refunded us half of the " cover charge " oh yes we had to pay a premium to be served that garbage. To have had to pay a daily gratuity for service that was to say the least non existent in most instances was the straw that broke the camels back. We have travelled with Princess cruise line before " Ruby status " this was a shocker and definitely not one to remember or recommend shame on you Princess.We were led to believe from one of the crew that the ship was going into dry dock after it's next voyage " NOT A DAY TOO SOON "A reply from Princess would be appropriate but how do you reply to the above !

My 2nd time eating here and it will be my final one.. the black pepper crab was nicer the first time round when I went there a few years ago. Why I decided not to go back was because of the rude staffs and their prices. With such prices, I would rather spend it at some nicer restaurants than at this coffee shop... service would also have been better. Trust me, spend your money elsewhere. You can’t eat in peace here

Don't come here for the ambience or for the service. But come for the crab and you will not be disappointed. This place is like a hole in the wall but the crabs are out of this world. And be sure to come at least 20 minutes before closing time at 8 PM or you will be told that you should leave because you will be have enough time to eat your crab.

This place has gone to the dumps since the head chef left some years back. I have stayed across the road from this restaurant for almost 20 years. In its heydays it had a queue of people and when I went last Friday, it was down to 3-4 tables filled on a weekend night and for a good reason - terrible food and service to match.Crabs costs a whopping $65/kg. For the same price, you could have eaten at restaurants in the comfort of air conditioning and better service (which is non-existent here). The crabs served were dry beyond the sauce, which I have to admit were tasty, but hey, I'm not paying $65/kg for the sauce am I?Stay past 8pm and the staff will start telling you to finish your food because they will close, and close they will, on the dot at 8.30pm sharp. Good luck if you haven't finished your food, because they will clear your food for you and shut the shutters on you.Did I also mention rats? Yup. Seriously, take your money elsewhere

Probaby the most disappointing cruise ship we have ever been on. Services could not cater for the 4100 passengers on board, getting into lifts in peak time impossible ( and they have the audacity to block off one sometimes two lifts to cater fo a handful of so called " haven " passengers) finding tables in buffet a nightmare, same with shows, lounges bars etc. Bar staff and waiters extremely efficient and pleasant cant say same for front desk staff found them to be very contradictory, unhelpful and rude to the point of being arrogant. Design of cabin leaves much to be desired to try and pass someone almost impossible huge settee / fold out bed jutting 3/4 of the way across the cabin and a ridiculous hand basin in the living area, fortunately toilet and shower were enclosed. Excursions extremely expensive for what they were and trying to disembark 4100 people on two tenders another nightmare. The overall experience very disappointing to say the least will never set foot on this ship again and most certainly would not recommend to anyone. On a more positive note we did a trip in the Mediterranean on Norwegian Spirit 2015 a most pleasant experience.

We have made phone booking for 3 medium black pepper crabs and some other dishes, mee goreng, fried rice, baby kailan and pork ribs for take away. The highlight is the black pepper crabs which they are famous for. It's peppery and mild spicy, yet it's sweet. We simply love it.The rest of dishes are pretty ok.In the past, we have heard about grumpy and rude staffs taking order and serving the dishes. However, we bet to differ. This place accept cash only. My wife went to collect the take away and somehow short of $12 to pay for the bill. Amazingly, the boss said it's ok and to pay him next time. We are not regular there and yet the boss trust we will pay him the next time.

We were a group of 4 and demolished a plate of prawns, 2 fried rice, a plate of delicious greens plus 4 crabs (2 chilli and 2 black pepper) all for less than S50 bucks a head. Worth the cab trip to get hear.
2
I used to come to this place for the black pepper crabs. The prices have skyrocketed. My last trip we paid between 50 and 75 sgd per crab and that's a total ripoff
5
The taxi ride from orchard road is well worth the time and effort to reach this iconic Singapore restaurant. The best black pepper crab around and icy cold tiger beer to wash it down!
The don't build or make restaurant's like this anymore
5
Fresh crab in a great pepper crab sauce. Best in SG. Order the crab, the fried rice and kai lan. Have the pepper sauce with the rice also. This is not a fancy place. You need to book the crab ahead. And they close around 8:30pm. Minimum two crab order
4
Had amazing black pepper crab. Consider booking the crab(s) a day before so you are not disappointed as they do run out of them. Mind you that booking the crab doesn't mean you wouldn't have to queue for a table to free up. Note also it's a local place, great food with efficient service are in focus, not known for warm and smiling service.

I ordered black pepper crab and mee goreng. the mee goreng is served within 5 minutes. The mee goreng is considered the good one in Singapore but a little too sweet for me. The black pepper crab is nice but slightly too hot for me.I find their service is good. I have read many reviews stating their service is bad. but i have to say that they provided good service for us during our visit. There is no queue when i reached the restaurant at 630pm. I managed to get a table easily
1
In the past, this particular Pepper Crab restaurant was very good, with long queues forming from about 6pm and they usually sell out before 8pmSo, the last time I had it was more than 10 years ago and have been thinking of going back again for the last few years but it only tool place yesterday (25 Feb 17). I was surprise why there isn't a queue at about 630pm, with a couple of tables to spare. That's strange, it's a Saturday evening.Mee goreng, it's just so so, and I was famished. Very oily I must say.Pepper Crab, that's what they are known for. I must say, it's by most, very very average like what you get from any ordinary neighbourhood coffee shop. And how much is it going for in the neighbourhoods? I don't know, but at Eng Seng, it's $80/kg. Is it worth that money? Ok I sound like some dissatisfied consumer, and I will say it loudly, YOU GOT TO PAY ME TO EAT IT AGAIN!. It's that kinda standard now!Is it just me, or is it my standard, or the chef is different just yesterday? Or a lot of typical consumer are just convincing themselves that even if it's not up to standard, they will still say it's good because they travelled all the way there, or their expectation are really that basic?Ok, that's my last visit to Eng Seng.Even the coffee didn't saved the day! Goodnes

Best crabs to share with family and overseas friends. But just let them know it is a no frills place - don't expect air-con nor posh seats. Served by family members or locals, so please don't expect too many smiles from them as they work all day and night - just expect good food. Prices are really very reasonable - try their Pepper crab and Mee goreng. For chilli crab, let them know if you do not want it to be too spicy. Very local, no expensive parking but have to look for parking around that area which is easy. My brother brought us there and realised that this simple but famous restaurant was also advertised and promoted in one of the world's famous airline magazine as a 'Must try'. I'm glad I did.

My rating and review is contexted: We had to travel across the island of Singapore to satisfy the hankering for black pepper crab of my friends which this reto is known for. Pluses:- Price: cheaper than those seafood places in Easy Coast Park.- Quality: fresh crabs (still kicking and alive just before cooking). Tastes like the usual black pepper crab. Hard to go wrong.Minuses:- I think the taste and quality is just at par with many other seafood restos in Singapore.- We need not have travelled that far to eat equally good crabs. - Not worth that extra tripIt is a good place for people who live nearby
2
For all the ravings about its pepper crab, I don't even find it good. Neither the flavour nor the crab texture is goodI still prefer my plain salted crab where I can still taste its freshnessDoesn't help that everyone in the restaurant is rud
5
By far the tastiest crab you will ever have - get ready to get messy.
Be there early as they run out fast - no reservations accepted
Best time to arrive 6pm it's a hawker restaurant so dress accordingly
4
The most awesome black pepper crabs in Singapore! Juicy, succulent, tasty crabs. Finger licking good. Have to go early, crabs sell out real fast. The yoo tiao is not bad either. Didn't enjoy the Mee goreng though. Btw, the address is 247, not 241.
4
Notice that the crab is getting expensive. Decide to order only Mee Goreng, Sambal Kangkong, Yu Tiao, Ko Lo Yuk and Fried Rice. Basically all is not bad except the Yu Tiao. I don't think is any special for the Yu Tiao.
5
Best local authentic pepper crabs! Don't bother going to those tourist restaurant for pepper crab, eng seng offers you the best taste.
They are really straight on opening hours, I.e close at 9pm sharp.
They also charge for the wet towels offered.
3
You don't pay for good service, you pay for them serving you a good old plate of black pepper crabs. As authentic as it can get. The real stuff.
4
For delicious crabs (a little pricy though) and seafood offerings, go during Dinner times or after 430pm.During Lunch, you can find chicken rice and Wantan noodles. For $4.50 you get a big plate of boneless chicken and a plate of fragrant chicken rice. Wantan Noodles price starts from $3/-. All the stall owners are very friendly and approachable. Coffeeshop setting, no air conditioning. Large crowd expected during dinner timings.
4
The place is quite a drive from the center. One cannot call it exactly a restaurant, more like a small local food court. But the food was good! Crabs were the best we had in Singapore, rice was good, veggies perfect. Far from fine-dining but a very positive local experience. Would definitely go back
5
Yes. We have big names like No SignBoard seafood, Jumbo seafood etc, nevertheless, no one is able to beat this traditional authentic pepper crab which highly rated by the locals.Warning: The pepper will really make you feel hot and sweat ! Make sure you arrive early as there will be a queue for sure
4
It is very delicious blackpepper crab. However, it is kinda expensive because we were only 2 persons and minimum order is 2 crabs, so each of us has one crab.Though it is very satisfying, but we were so full and the price made us full too.. haha..Overall, it is good, once in awhile~
3
It was my first pepper crab. In my country we make good crab and seafood. First its a mud crab, so flavor its completely different of others crabs i'm used to. It tastes, like the name indicates, a lot of pepper. Its always good with friends and beer. Its ok. I really enjoyed the rice and other snacks that they had in the menu. Not cheap
5
Local restaurant which serves best Black Pepper Crab in Singapore. Restaurants starts open at 16:30 every night.Remember, don't arrive too late, as the crab may sold our easily. Minimum order is 2 crab per order.
5
Best pepper crabs in town. Locals pointed out that the best deal in town for pepper crabs was in Joo Chiat and we were not disappointed.
5
I was taken here by a friend from Singapore and the black pepper crab is really excellent. The restaurant is quite spartan, but the food is simply great
4
We arrived at 4:30 pm on a Saturday evening, early enough to find tables (and more importantly available car parking space nearby). Fortunately for us, there were only 2 tables occupied. Orders were taken quickly although the waitress sounded rather impatient (even when there was other tables to take order). We ordered fried "bee hoon" (S$7 per plate), vegetables (S$10 per plate), and 2 medium sized black pepper crabs (S$102). I find the pepper sauce a tad sweet for my liking. Otherwise, the quality is still there and the other dishes are tasty
3
Learnt from the tripadvisor.com that, the shop is closed at near 8:30pm (But opened at around 5pm; & Close on Wed.) and the location is a bit far from MRT, So I arrived to this restaurant at ~ 5:15pm, by taxi. The shop is a bit dirty, no air conditioner, the toilet is very horrible (Not suitable for lady. :) ) I tried the black pepper crab (Their signature dish; min. for 2 crabs), It's too spicy, but the taste is very good. If you had tried the crab from other famous restaurants, and feel boring. You can try this restaurant and their price is a bit cheaper.P.S. Cash payment only
1
I dont deny the crabs were tasty. The service was sucks to that Max! Their closing time at around 8.30, by 7.55 they are already chasing n rushing customers out from their store. Imagine a few of the customers were still eating crabs, they just pulled down shutters and staked up all the chairs, waiting and staring at us giving us pressure to faster finish the food. Imagine all have to leave the store with greasy fingers..
1
This shop has been in business for many years and I remember going to queue at 5pm when the queue is already till the bus stop. Recently I went back to them again for crabs and the coffee shop is really empty no more queue and I guess people stopped going as the staff unfriendly attitude. The lady who always take order will raise her voice at customer, restrict them from sitting at available table, no menu provided etc. After all these years she never change LOL. Their famous dish beside the crabs are mee goreng which is tasty too. The price of the crabs are also expensive compared to the others shop. Average cost of 1 crab is about S$35-S$40 and minimum you need to order 2 crabs for either chilli or black pepper so I will say averagely each meal will cost between S$100-150 depending on what you order (just to highlight they charge GST of 7%)

I have been on a mission to find the best Pepper Crab in Singapore. I tried Eng Seng on Sunday and I have to say the Pepper Crab was excellent. Was it as good as Jumbo's... Hum... probably Yes! My only criticism was the price at $78 for Pepper Crab alone. As I see Eng Seng as a Hokka style restaurant I expected the price to be less than Jumbo's. But at %78 this is what I would expect to pay at Jumbo's.In all other respects this was an excellent meal and the pepper flavour permeated all the way through the crab meat. Also the crab was beautifully cracked so I didn't need a bib.
5
oh well, I have been a regular now....love the super down-to-earth old-style, you would still hear them 'ordering' food for you simply by 'speaking' to the kitchen from hall...oh well, old fashion, old style, and get you the supreme good crab with really good price.yep, if you like to enjoy a finger-licking-good black pepper crab, here it is.
5
I went there with friends by Mrt so we hopped off at Eunos and the walk about 10 min to the restaurant. We actually walked pass this place at first because it looks like a local foodcourt. It's very easy to find though, at the corner of Joo Chiat road!!! We ordered 2 chilli crabs 2 black pepper crabs and sambal morning glory. The food was one of the best meal we had during our stay!!!One thing you have to keep in mind is this place close at 8.45pm which you can literally eat until 8.30pm and they will start staring at you. I remember after I asked for the bill at 8.35pm, they just ran to our table and took everything away. My hands were still greasy after I left the restaurant ! Get there before 7.30 and you will have a great time!Ps. If you go on the weekend you might want to reserve your crabs
4
The crabs are of very good quality. I asked for female crabs and most came with orange roe. Yummy! One comment though, the crabs not thoroughly clean but dont really care! Highly recommended
5
Only you have to finish the dinner before 8:30. They start to clean and even pull the doors down to ask you out, even you have not finish the crab.
4
Having eaten so many black pepper crabs from different places located around the island, this is by far the BEST black pepper crab I've tasted! The sauce has got the aroma of dark soya sauce which adds extra flavour to it! A must-try if you love black pepper crab! Book before you go and they'll close for business once all crabs are sold out
5
We always come back to this place for the black pepper crab simply coz they make the best gravy. Despite the recommendations by others to call to make sure you get crab before they run out, we never call and always get crab. Queue wasn't so bad every time. This is Singapore after all. We're not very fond of the other recommended dish -- mi goreng, we consider it so-so. Do not expect any fancy service, this place is known for its black pepper crab only, not for service. That said, we think service is fast and fair. Nothing more, nothing less. Yes, we've been kicked out once before we finished our dinner. We arrived rather late, around 7.45pm or a bit later. After waiting for table then ordering until finally got our dishes, not much time left for eating. And eating crab takes time as you know. They just gave us 10 mins warning that they going to close then they started clearing our table and stacking chairs and then finally shut off lights few mins before 8.30pm. We protested that we're not finished eating yet but of course we were powerless (literally). We conceded and they packed our unfinished meal so we could take it home. Verdict? Yes, we returned for the yummy crab and we returned earlier to have enough time to eat and to not get kicked out. We respect their closing time
2
If you like to be abused, yelled at but like to eat the best black pepper crab, you are at the right place. The staff treats you like being in a prison camp. The only remedy is to yell back at them, which put them on hold temporarily. Be sure to refrain from a sanitary stop, cause you will be shocked. They close at 19:30 hrs and if you happen to be there around this time, they will kick you out and close the shop. Pro: the best black pepper crab, con: service sucks. This summarize the experience at Eng Seng

Looking for a great chilli and pepper crab meal in Singapore Eng Seng is the place to go. It is a little out of the way but worth the taxi ride. Taxis know two addresses to get there, 241 Joo Chiat Place or ( cnr Kun Seng and Still streets ) If you are looking for 5 star gourmet food and silver service don't bother, the service is pretty slap stick but the chilli and pepper crab was absolutely delicious unlike most others they do not have buns for dunking in sauce, but if you ask nicely, and they haven't run out they will bring you some bread to dunk into the sauces. The restaurant ( more an eating house ) caters in the main for locals, other than the four of us there was probably only two other tables that were not locals, this speaks for itself !!! We also had a pork dish and a vegetable which were very tasty as well. The service is very much " here is your food eat " some reviews have referred to the staff as being rude we did not find them rude just not worried about small talk and smiling in order to try and solicit a tip out of you.. The crab is also less expensive than most of the other " tourist trap " crab restaurants. They charge $55 to 60 per kg. NB it is advisable to go early as that they are only open from 5 to 9pm !!! ENJOY THE EXPERIENC
5
Have visited several times for their chili crab. Both black peper and chili crab is a must to try. Mee Goreng is also good for sharing. High value for money. Remember call to reserve crabs in advance to avoid disappointment. They open in 4pm and sometimes crabs sold out near 6.30pm. All crabs are reserved with even numbers. It's opened in an old coffee shop. Don't expect fancy design of the shop and high standard customer service. After all, it's the taste of food that counts
3
Was there at 5.30pm on a Thursday and there are already a good couple of table dining. You could see the crowd started streaming in and by 6pm, the restaurant is full. Staff are quick to attend to you and you need to order a minimun of 2 crab. Anything order of lesser then 2 crab would not be entertain. Order both the chilli and black pepper crab. Chilli crab was so so. Not spicy at all and the too little gravy and it is too starchy as well. The pepper crab is not too bad but we found it a little sweet. Plus point is the food are all pipping hot. In general, the price is reasonable and food taste alright. Don't expect too much of a service standard as I percieve them more like a zhi char level with staff shouting across the hall for orders in their sloppy attire.Do be early if you want to try them out. Their last order is at 8.30pm

What a terrible place and unacceptable behaviour from staff. Cheap price tag + Very bad service and environment = Unenjoyable dinner My friends and I love crabs. However last night the experience at Eng Seng Restaurant was the worst ever. We will not go back to Eng Seng again.The people at this restaurant are rude and sour faced. This isn't Singapore style service at all - this is the very worst possible standard.They don't have a menu and have limited dishes available. They harassed us to finish our meal fast so we had to rush through our crab. By 8pm on a Tuesday evening, they closed tables loudly, noisily brought down shutters and stood near our table and stared at us. They said we could eat till 8.30pm we were chased out by 8.15pm.The pepper crabs were tasty but they were not meaty and not very fresh (a bit soggy inside). While they tasted good, it was not more tasty than other good restaurants in Singapore. In short - nothing so special that makes the bad service treatment justifiable. Singaporeans love food and a good bargain but we also enjoy talking to our friends while savouring great food. While the meal was undeniably cheaper than average, the entire experience was so bad you have to ask yourself, if the cost savings was worth it. We didn't enjoy our outing and had adjourn at a nearby cafe to regroup for a drink and to chat. This is NOT the best crab place in SG. Singapore has much better crab restaurants to offer than Eng Seng. Head to 2 Chefs (Commonwealth) or Chin Huat (Sunset Way) for an affordable and excellent time with friends
4
Those who wanted to try , go around 4.30pm onwards. Don't come at 6+ or else I don't even know there is much crabs left for you. Black pepper crab is a must to order. Their chilli crab is ok, great and juicy meat but not perfect. Can try order mee goreng while waiting for crabs. Very good. Overall this place is great. But service can be better. No booking of seats, come earlier if u all want enjoy or else regret.
4
my all time pampering restaurant - however u better arrive at odd time- 4-5pm for ur early dinner- if not there will be out of crabs!! so far, i found it is one of the most consistent n great black pepper crab in sg. if u like crab, the powerful black pepper brings out the sweetness of the crabs. yummmmmmmmm!!
5
Even though the place not so good. Only hawker place. The serviced just ordinary Singapore style (not so friendly). But you should try the food. And the price very reasonableI ate Chile crab very good. Have to have black pepper crab its the best. The other food just ordinary, nothing special
4
I love shellfish, when we went to Singapore for a short trip, some friends who live there took us to this place famous for their black pepper crab, I thought just some crab cooked in a black pepper sauce but it was out of this world! The flavour is so moorish and the crab is so tender and fresh, I can go on and eat another half a dozen more! Although the restaurant is not the best looking place but who cares when the food tastes that good, no wonder they pack out every night, it's a shame that we don't live there! Anyone who visits Singapore needs to try this
5
First of all, for those who gave poor judgements of this restaurant might be because they were going to this place late after the resto are about to close. Yes, they're close relatively early, they open the resto from 5pm and close at 9. So you can imagine how crowded the resto, and the foods finished quickly, so they have to close approximately at 9. I came at 6, luckily we don't have to queue. We ordered Singaporean chilly crabs and black pepper crabs. Just by seeing, the foods raise up my appetite. So, if you really want to enjoy the foodgasm, like I do, go earlier, 5-6 pm is a good time, still not to crowd. Don't blame the resto just because you don't really know when the best time is
4
Eating crab in Singapore is usually an $80+ experience and finds you in all the touristy areas. Eng Seng was a great little gem that caters mainly for locals and at local prices. Cost for pepper crab was around $40. And it was absolutely delicious. Is more of a hawker style restaurant, so don't expect anything flash
4
The place is not exactly in a tourist area, and it does not appear to be particularly clean and/or well maintained either, but the black pepper crab they serve is absolutely delicious.Don't go there in your best suit, nor expect to continue the evening in a posh venue...unless you want all the cats of Singapore to follow you, but I would definitely recommend it for a taste of good crab at absolutely affordable prices.Oh...and the choice of drinks is between soft drinks and Tiger beer

We were recommended this restaurant by friends in Australia and had been pre warned about the service, pre ordering the crabs etc and pre warned about the up front and curt service. We are happy to report it was such an enjoyable experience dining here we would have no hesitation in going back. This is no fancy restaurant, more traditional hawker with plastic chairs and plates and the service is a little abrupt but we got along famously with all the staff, had photos taken with them and even supplied complimentary appetisers of fried chicken wings which were amazingly good. We did call in advance to order 4 crabs, 2 chilli and 2 black pepper, 3 of us dining. The crab although not the biggest I have had in Singapore were absolutely diving. I am a die hard fan of chilli crab but have been completely converted to a black pepper crab fan. Although not a lot of sauce the crabs were coated in a thick black sticky peppery sauce that was out of this world. The crab was sweet and messy, just as it should be. Crab tools are available on request. There is a wash basin out the back to clean your self up and you can see inside the kitchen while doing so. The smell was of freshly ground black pepper and truly a wonderful scent. Icy cold beer was available and was perfect with the spicy crab.Note:- Don't dress up or wear white, you will certainly splash something.The so called crab nazi is a bit curt on the phone but such a lovely lady in person, we loved her company and she was extremely hospitable towards us.Do go early, tables fill quickly. We arrived around 6pm and it was in full swing.Open restaurant so no aircon and basic facilities. Toilets on site.Suggest taking hand wipes as this is an eat with your hands moment

We discovered this restaurant, as we were heading back from Jumbo Seafood and the taxi driver asked us how was our food there...we replied that it was ok, but really expensive, so he was so nice to recommend Eng Seng to us, saying that its his favorite place to eat pepper crabs, so we decided to give it a try the next day....Although the service is a little rough, which i didnt mind at all, the food is delicious! we ordered the garlic bokchoys, fried rice, two pepper crabs, and two beers and the price was awesome, only 70 bucks!!! Which is really a quarter of the price that you would pay at Jumbo or any other big restaurant! The crabs were delicious, so was everything else we ordered, its a little out of the way from everything else, but its so worth the cab ride there. We went on a Monday at 545pm and there were only 4 tables occupied, the food came out really fast and every one was really nice and pleasant including the famous nazi crab lady! Forget the big restaurants and head to Eng Seng for authentic Singaporean black pepper crabs!!
5
Don't let the name of this place get your hopes up. There is nothing restaurant about the tables, positioned precariously beside a drain; nor expect 5 star service with white table linen. Instead, come here for the amazing Black Pepper Crab. One dish is all you need. They close by 8 so come early, and there is always a crowd so be prepared to wait a little
5
The Chili Crap and Black Pepper Crab were awesome. This was my first time having either but we were with friends who have had it many times in Singapore and thought this was some of the best they have had. We had 2 Chili and 2 Black Pepper, a vegtable, fried rice and 4 Tiger beers and our bill was 150. Very reasonable. The waitress was a little demanding but that made the experience all that the much more fun. Went on a Monday early evening no crowd. It started to get busier as we left
4
Went here for some pepper crabs with some friends. The crabs were the best I have ever eaten in Singapore, without a doubt. Service is a little rough, but with the quality of food, it is a worthwhile place to visit.
3
quite resonable but still on the high side compare the taste of it. However still consider good and convienence as just opersite the hotel!!
5
All-time favourite for my peppery crab. Together with other dishes such as, Mee Goreng, You Tiao etc.
5
Every time I go to Singapore Eng Shang is one of my must stops for pepper crab. I would not even think of going some place else for this meal

They open at 16:30. We got there at around 17:00 on a Saturday and the place was already almost full - only two tables available. About fifteen minutes later a queue started forming, as all the tables were full.We got four crabs for a company of five , which was more that enough. With five big bottles of Tiger, fried rice and kai-lan for all we paid a total of 200 SGD (130 euros/160 USD) which is a great price for such a treat. The black pepper crabs are fresh, tasty, tender, full of flavour and were prepared fast and brought to the table a few minutes after the kai-lan and the rice. Two of our friends that have eaten black pepper crabs in other Singaporean outlets, said that those of Eng Seng are the best they ever had. For me it was a delightful first - and certainly not last- visit to this deservedly famous establishment

Read the previous reviews & it would largely accord with my previous visits. Fantastic black pepper crabs & some other dishes but rough & ready service. It's hugely popular so go as early as you can although it seems weird to have dinner before 6 but really that's the best time to go to (5.30 is even better) to ensure a table & best crabs & service (such as it is) at its freshest start. Lady who takes orders is no nonsense type - I've read she's been called the 'crab nazi'. Would recommend the Mee goreng, the Chilli crab (If u.like the sambal type) but save your stomach space for the best black pepper crabs in Singapore. The bill I've always felt to be very good for value. Come here for the great food & if you're looking for service & atmosphere - go elsewhere. I've never been after 7 so maybe the comments on the really bad service at closing time possibly is true so take my advice go at 5.30

After spending half and hour and $20 for a taxi ride, plus walking around for 20 mins since we couldn't find the place, I utterly hoped that the crab was worth all the trouble. And it is. We were lucky that when we got there (6pm on Saturday), there wasn't much waiting time. We were seated quickly. For a party of two, we ordered 2 black peppered crabs (min. order of 2 crabs), plus a stir fried baby cailan vegetable, and a small fried rice. The fried rice was good ($4). The vegetable was alright ($8). But the crabs were soooooooo delicious!!! I kept licking my fingers. I bet I looked ridiculous while eating that crab! Anyway, total came to $71. That was half of what we paid for a meal at No Signboard the other day

Dont get confused by the name if you dont know the style of eating out in singapore. Its more of a foodcourt type of a place with all it comes - plastic chairs and tables, very local staff and far off fromThr centreBUTYou get fantastic crabs for fantastic price!You experence local atmospherePlan it along with your trip to east coast as its nearCome early to avoid queuesBring extra tissues as they only have wet wipes and charge for itYou can get cheap beer there as its not a restaurant per seVery chilled place for friends/couples - far from romance so dont recommend for date

Just had the worst dining experience of my life at Eng Seng restaurant on Still/Joo Chiat place - both of us went in at 8pm - pressurized to take their last 3 crabs to finish their stock - asked to just have crab and not other dishes-warned to finish by 8.45pm-at 8.45 (which is 10min faster than my watch) without our agreement took our unfinished food and packed - someone stand next to us with the change waiting for us to pay-the best part is they switched off the light while we are still eating-the waiters and waitress are obnoxious and unfriendly!! It feel like I've just been "raped

Many reviews here mention the long wait if you come late. That alone should tell you something and the service is good if you've been standing waiting, watching other dinners take their time with their meal, it's fast paced stuff. When served we weren't asked "how you want that, with garlic or..." Instead it's matter of fact "Baby kailan - ok" It's served just one way because that's how we do it - OK. Then the Black Pepper Crab, which is what most come for & what I primarily base my rating on, the smooth gravy is for me , perfect. A little sweet, hot & peppery good to the very last. Other dishes tasted were also good wholesome well prepared dishes but the crab is the stand out. Call to book the crab not the table

If you ever make it to this restaurant, just order the the black pepper crabs and brace yourself for zero service. The chilli crabs are not worth your time; there are better ones elsewhere in Singapore. Even the yummylicious black pepper sauce could not erase the bad taste left in our mouths as a result of the appalling service attitude. We arrived 45min before the closing time. Helper took our orders in a flash, literally ordering for us instead of asking what we wanted. 15min before closing and with a few tables of customers still eating their food, the restaurant folks started to switch off the fans, some lights and hollered warnings that the restaurant is closing. It was like a swat team of cleaners descended upon the place and started operation clean-up. We decided to doggy-bag the balance of our food and took turns to wash our hands. The toilet was closed so there was only one sink. even as we washed our hands, the helpers closed the grills and switched off the remaining lights. We were literally forced to leave the place. Before we even caught our breath, the swat team has cleared the scene. The whole experience was surreal. The restaurant is on our blacklist permamently

The Black Pepper Crab is great!!! Except the fact that it opens only at 4:30 p.m. and the crabs sell out by 5:00 p.m...

The black pepper crab is to die for.. never mind the hawker like surroundings and the never ending queue. I found the chilli crab gravy way too starchy though.

the black pepper crab is famous. so is the queue.
but i think crab taste is over-powered by black pepper.
it's delicious but i prefer crab vermicelli to taste the crab.

This is famous for pepper crab. It's a nice chinese style black pepper in thick soya sauce. However, you have to queue for get a seat and people have complain of bad service attitude.
