I had a simple meal and it turns out to be fine. Not exceptionally fantastic, but its just beef noodle at a higher price. I used to think it was much better before it is part of the Paradise Group, but maybe that's me.

Beef noodle was delicious, cant deny that, we enjoyed the food
Service is poor: Waiter - Bobby Tye is having a sulky face as he serves or receives orders.
2 Stars above - for good welcome from Counter Staff and Quality Food

Have been patronising this place for many times. Beef (A2) is super tender that my son can jus swallow it. Chilli is good. Soup is a little salty & leave your mouth really dry & thirsty after that.

We were looking for a nice place and couldn't find a better option. Menu is simple, cheap and extremely delicious. And very fast service. Out waiters and Ms. Sook Ye were very nice.

I had return to this branch a few times by now and it has been a great lunch experience. There are top up for lunch for drinks and a selected side which is advisable. Go to the more exclusive items such as Taiwanese dish and drinks like soya bean drink. The noodles are great and portion is just enough. It is a alternative to having ramen all the time

My partner and I was having short getaway to Sentosa Singapore for our anniversary. We found there is a restaurant whereby outside of the Casino with a big crowd of people. This restaurant was selling beef noodles and white broth pork noodles. We found there is interesting to try out since inside was big crowd. At first we are standing outside to be seated and the great we met Vincent (server) who act fast to address us and told us he will find a table for us as soon people left. After couple of minutes, he managed to find a table for us at the side corner and he host us with a great smile (even he is exhausted) and explain about the concept of the restaurant and how to order. He did recommended us must try the wagyu Beef Noodle and guide us how to order the type of noodles and soup. The restaurant was very crowd and Vincent was really fast to run around restaurant to serve the customers (mostly are Mainland China). The environment was noisy but we understand that Sentosa is a main attraction in Singapore. We chooses to try the wagyu Beef Noodle and broth is the authentic, the Beef was too many fat on the beef chunk however the broth was very compliment with the noodle. That√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s why the people are queuing up at outside to try the Beef Noodle. The prices are reasonable with average $16.00 Singapore dollars for an excellent noodle. Will recommend to our friends and family when we back to Philippines. God Bles

this concept belongs to the established paradise group so expectations were high. I have ordered the most expensive spicy beef noodle soup. I was not happy with the soup flavours and the amount of beef was mediocre, comes with 5 - 6 small pieces. not worth it. we were seated next to the entrance which was not pleasant either. noisy

My wife have a craving for noodles and happen to see this outlet. Tried the food which was reasonably priced. Noodle was just nice and despite items are not so much variety, guess quality is controlled. Not so much for the service which is no service
4
Will come at least 2-3 times a month for my lunch craves.
Love the beef noodles soup and spicy dumpling noodles.
Hope you like them too !

Savory Taiwan Beef noodles in Singapore. This is where we would go when we're feeling hungry in VivoCity. Go for traditional brisket if you're new to beef noodles. It get crowded during lunch and dinner.

Went to this restaurant for dinner. Was very satisfied with the quality of beef used and the broth was excellent. Great value for money considering it's only $9.90 per bowl!

Dined with hubby at the outlet located at CompassOne around 2.30 pm to try their food there. Space is small and no wonder long queue at dinner and weekends. This is definitely not a place for group dining but more of eat and go. This restaurant is part of Paradise Group and also they waived off the service charge. Do not expect too much out of customer service even during off peak hours and probably the reason why they waived off service charge. We ordered their signature wagyu beef noodle in spicy soup. The beef is well marinated and is only about 4 - 5 pieces and it's not really big and costs around $15. The broth somehow lacked the meaty beef taste that should be present. Somehow it taste bland and just not up to it and does not live up to expectation. The scallion pork noodles (dry) is slightly better. The pork is well braised and well marinated. Also 4 - 5 pieces in total but quite bony. The bean curd fish paste is refreshing. Light in taste although it's fried. Worth a try though. Overall we preferred the bean curd more than the noodles. Unlikely to visit again

Location @ Compass OneDate : 10 Sept 2016Order 2 bowls beef noodles and 2 soya milk, waited 30mins, drinks not even served. Asked the waitess abt my order and it takes 5mins to served the drinks, first i thot was fresh soya drink n tats why needed to wait for them to ground the soya, food still nid to wait another 15mins.

Was v angry n we told the mgr juz cancel the order, tis mgr dun even feels bad n dun even wanna try do something abt it too. So went off, will NEVER NEVER step in there anymore. Lousy service n bad attitude

I saw online recommendation that it was very nice, I tried it and find it was overrated. The pickled vege was tasteless compare to other joins that I have tried. Overall. value for money, good portion, taste and flavor was not bad. But I can't said it is very good

I have always doubted that this would be a good place to check out beef noodles until i had a chance to follow my colleagues out for lunch and ended up at this beef noodle place (Bugis) Surprise to find that the beef brisket are soft & tender, it melts into your mouth. Had the soup based with pickled veg. Its delicious. Worth checking Lenu out.

I had dinner with my wife and it was a good experience. We ordered a signature Beef Noodle with two appetizer, Tofu and bitter gourd. The soup was good as well as the noodle and beef. It was not the best but worthy to its price

Came here twice in one week for dinner - the broth is so good, we couldn't stop thinking about it! Fairly simple menu, we ordered the beef brisket and there were three types of broth and three types of noodles to choose from. Each person got a different broth and they were all great, and my favorite noodles were the broad noodles but I'm a wide noodle kind of girl :

Lenu noodle soupIs what i like to eat during a cold rainy day! I always stick to the original soup flavour with rice noodles . Bees slices were generous. Prices reasonable at average of sgd 10 per bowl for beef slices, a little more expensive for wagyu beef at around sgd 16 per bowl. To me , the special beef sauce was just okay. Nothing to shout about. I like chopped chilli with the noodles instead..

After vivocity shopping and Universal day I had the dinner here. Many people may think it is salty but I like it. The taiwanese soy drink which they sell there was also nice.

Visited this place for dinner. Ordered the beef noodles. The broth of the soup is flavorful, but not as heavy as the ones we had in Taiwan. It seems that the broth is more localized as its less salty and heavy.Fresh beef but the portion seems a tad too small. Noodles ample though. No frills self-ordering restaurant

Looking for a dinner fix, I come across LeNu in Vivocity. The restaurant looks nice enough and I'm craving for some soup noodles. It's one of those restos you have to fill up a sheet of paper for your order and line up to the cashier to order and pay at the same time. You order from there, and they will served the food a little while. I chose the spicy beef brisket noodle soup. Had sliced cucumber for appetizer. The appetizer taste fine. However I was rather disappointed with the soup. The noodles were fine, as well as the beef brisket albeit the smaller serving. What's not good was the taste of the broth. It somehow tastes flat and I know that you can get better beef noodle soup somewhere else for the same price or lesser

Walking thru Vivo Shopping Centre after 8pm and some restaurants had closed for the day and LeNu was still open.The ordering system is a bit hard to work out but I have done it before and wrote up the order but none of the staff would serve us.Then we worked it out that you have to go back to the counter and pay.We ordered 2 serves of the Braised Beef Shank with noodle and 2 cans of Coke.This came to $23.40. Not Bad.It was a very large bowl but it tasted very watery and everything tasted the same.There should be a difference in the taste of the meat to the noodles.I didn't leave here with the attitude that this was great
3
The noodles are rather salty. Place is rather small and can be uncomfortable when the table is small. The staff dont allow customers to sit on a bigger seat. Thats not so friendly. The staff throwing temper and passing bad remarks on customers sitting on a bigger space.

I've been to the Vivocity outlet before and was at their Bugis Junction outlet last Saturday. A 2-restaurant chain that's part of the Paradise Group of Restaurants, this one specializes in Taiwanese beef noodles. This is mid-priced, semi self-service dining (you place your order on an order sheet and bring it to the counter for payment), perfect for a quick, tasty meal. The broth is delicious (very hearty) and the servings sufficient. But be aware your bill can add up if you start ordering the pickles and small eats (which you pick up yourself at the refrigeration unit), as well as drinks

We were given the menu and order form while seated. Then we have to order and pay at the counter.There are 3 choices of soup base and noodles to choose from. The authentic braised beef soup was flavourful. I preferred the thin noodles as compared to the broad ones. The beef shank was tender, while the brisket was a bit dry and hard.Not forgetting the side dish, the chilled tofu with century egg was very good too

Passed by LeNu Beef Noodles Bar @ Bugis Junction several times, but never thought to try until the other day when I had to fight for dining space with the lunchtime crowd after an appointment there. Seeing that LeNu (Happy Cow) Beef Noodles Bar was not too crowded with visible tables in sight, and since I was craving for soup stuff, I headed in.Anyway, LeNu Beer Noodles Bar serves authentic Taiwanese-style beef noodles, one of the symbolic dishes of the Taiwanese food scene. It is a restaurant simple in style and menu; I easily picked out what I wanted to eat. They serve beef meat, beef brisket, wagyu beef noodles etc, and one could have the choice of broad or thin noodles as well as type of soup base.The Braised Beef Combination Noodles (SGD$13.90) consists of brisket, tendon and shank, so one could have the best of all worlds. The broad noodles and spicy soup base was being chosen for this order. The soup had a distinctive "mala" (numb spiciness) flavour to it, but was not that spicy. The broad noodles were chewy but a tad hard IMHO. The beef parts were heavenly - so melty and succulent, disintegrating richly in the mouth readily.My Braised Beef Brisket Noodles (SGD$10.90) with the original soup base was awesome! The strands of noodles were well-textured with a springy bite to it. The broth was rich in flavour - sweetness of the beef and some herbs. The beef brisket was soft and tender; and the overall portion was generous so it made the price all worth it. No wonder even the group of Caucasian patrons sitting next to me held nothing but praise (one of them recommended this place to the other 4, as far I could gather from their conversation).For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/05/lunch-at-lenu-beef-noodles-bar-bugis.htm

We were looking for a quick bite while in Bugis and my partner suggested this. Since I make my own Taiwanese beef noodles and grew up eating this stuff, I was not as enthusiastic but decided to give it a try. It's a weird system, you get seated, read the menu and then need to go to till to order and pay. Then you sit and wait for the waiter to bring your noodles. It's pretty quick but if he's busy at the till, your bowl sits on the counter waiting - they do NOT let you pick it up. I ordered the spicy shank and my partner ordered the original brisket. They do not have the Sriracha chilli only chopped chilli or a sweeter chilli paste. I found the original too bland without the chilli sauce. The spicy soup was perfect. The beef was also very tasty and well cooked, both the shank and brisket were cooked well. Green onions and vegetables also accompany the soup. It was a little pricy for noodle soup but the bowl was quite large and quality of ingredients were good. Also most food courts in Singapore are pricier so this is actually pretty average for a food court. Is it as good as in Taiwan? It's pretty darn close (most of the Taiwanese snacks in Singapore I find are lacking in authenticity) I would go back

LeNu had an advert in the newspapers and we (my mother and I) thought we could give it a try since we had the required card for the offer.The offer was only good for the Braised Wagyu Beef Noodles, so that's what we had. We started with two orders of the noodles, and found it fairly good. Since we were starving before we started dinner, and the dish was good, we ordered a third serving of noodles to share.The noodles had good texture and was flavourful, the beef is served fairly rare, so you push it into the soup to cook to the degree of perfection you desire, and the soup base tasted great, with the downside of making you thirsty after a while
