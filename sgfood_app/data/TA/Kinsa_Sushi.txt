Kinsa Sushi is a great place if you're looking for good quality sushi in the HillView/Upper Bukit Timah area. The service is great, and the ambience is nice.

Kinsa Sushi Located at 4 Hillview rise, #02-02, hillv2 it’s a cosy little Japanese restaurant at HillV2 away from the maiden crowd. Hence, this hidden gem offers a family friendly environment that caters premium dishes to a larger audience with lower price points. Stand-out dishes were The Wagyu Don, which contained pan fried wagyu beef on rice and miso soup, was prepared using A4 Grade Wagyu from Kagoshima Japan. Also on the menu it offers a range of its wide offerings – appetizers (Wagyu Tataki, Tamago Yaki), Sashimi, Sushi, Grilled Items, Hotplates, Deep Fried Items (Tempura, Karaage), Soups, Dons, Noodles (Udon, Soda), Bento Sets and Desserts. One unique feature of Kinsa Sushi was that they had a seasonal seafood tank near the front of the restaurant for you to pick fresh seafood items (seafood comes from various parts of Japan 3-4 times a week), and have them prepared in cooking methods of your choice. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

Bad service, food is average. Waiting 40 mins for a katsu don and we are the first customer. Need to sent back and cancel the Katsu don because i can taste it was leftover, just re-fried. Tonkatsu was hard, burned, dry, and oily, seriously, it's re-fried even when "The Manager: Jasmine" said default answer "our food is fresh"Came a replacement within 3 mins, definitely mine was recycle food. We decided to leave

I'm an avid sushi lover and if you are too, you definitely need to come over to Kinsa at HillV2 and eat their sushi!I'll skip the cooked noodles (usons, soba etc.) and dons (rice) and just go for the sushi.If you're a raw salmon sushi kinda person, you won't regret the salmon sushi (3.90$), and their spicy salmon sushi (2.90$). Their salmon belly is priced at an affordable 9.90$ for 5 thick and fresh pieces. I believe they're also famous for the A4 Wagyu Beef Don (25$) but I have yet to try that yet. Hands down the best affordable sushi places in Singapore. They should definitely open more stores. They'd be a hit.(P.S. they have a 30% off weekday lunch discount on selected items like their salmon sushi. If you're undecided about the place, go for that instead!

I really do not know why I've not discovered this gem earlier. I had such a great time dining alone, as the food and service was fantastic. I had the mentai roll (flame grilled salmon on purple rice that melted in my mouth) and cha soba. Both were cooked to perfection. Interestingly they have a robot waiter to bring out the dishes to the table, which are then plated by the friendly waiters. Prices are definitely affordable for the high quality of food. My only gripe is they should not charge fifty cents for a wet towel. Next time I'll skip the towels and go for a bigger spread of food. I'll definitely return

Located on 2nd floor of hill view rise, serve Japanese food and sushi. The food here is not bad. I ordered beef yakiniku set, chicken teriyaki set, salmon don set and a Coke light. I added a soup and chawanmushi. Total bill $52.00Service is ok.

Had a dinner for two at Kinsa Sushi. Although a small eatery, the food here is pretty good and also thanks to its high patron turnover that keeps their food inventory fresh. There are other food options besides sushi for the low-carbo eaters. And it is decent good tasting jap food in the suburban, without the need to crowd into the city centres like in Orchard. Price wise seems reasonable for the quality served.

We were introduced to this Restaurant by my daughter in law. Their highlight is Wagyu beef rice at a very good price of $24.90. Small but cosy place with sufficient capacity. Their service is quite good and their food quality is as expected of most Japanese restaurant - authentic. Tempura is good, sashimi is good, wagyu beef rice is good value. Recommended

Was here with two other friends to try the wagyu don during a weekday dinner, but it turned out average. We found it quite tasteless. Not quite worth the drive unless you stay around there. However, the service was good and the staff were attentive.

The presentation of the food is very similar to many Japanese restaurants, the price is almost similar to that in town. However the outlet is relatively small and the wait staff's service can be improved much further.

If you're into Japanese Seafood Salad, this is one of the best that I have savoured here in SG! Best in terms of quality and at just $8.90. That's value for money! Take a look at the photo.... a picture speaks a thousand words! Oishi!

Saw this at a food review so thought I would come here. Essentially it is a nice Neighbourhood restaurant but not worth driving all the way especially for this place. Chirashi don was okay. Ordered the tamago and ikura and felt it was severely over represented in the photo because they gave hardly any ikura unlike true photo.

This restaurant has just launched their new Purple Rice menu. This my first time I heard of Purple Café. Purple rice has the same benefits as brown rice and contains a large amount of anthocyanin anti-oxidants, which help the human body to combat heart disease, cancer amongst others.There are 10 items on this menu to choose from and we had the following:- Salmon Mentai: $15.80. Crabmeat and cucumber maki topped with aburi salmon mentaiko, garnished with salmon roe. This maki was unique. Purple rice was used instead of short-grain Japanese rice. Taste-wise, no issue, just like eating the usual maki. The maki is topped with salmon pieces and mentaiko cream before being broiled. It's good!- Mango Maki: $14.80. Prawn tempura, cucumber and mango maki, topped with wasabi seasoned prawn roe. Crab. It's really too pretty to eat... Fried Ebi prawn with mango Maki. Purple rice used instead of traditional Japanese short grained rice. - Hotate Mentai: $17.80. Crabmeat and cucumber maki topped with aburi scallops mentai, garnished with wasabi seasoned prawn roe and deep -fried grated radish.- Chirashi Cupcake: $15.80. An assortment of sashimi on purple rice. served with a house blended goma sauce. You can really taste the purple rice texture here, as the sauce is served on the side. It reminds me a lot of black glutinous rice dessert. Its nice. I must say my first time trying purple rice is nice and I wouldn’t mind having this again the next time I am here, especially if it has health benefits too

It's a cozy little Japanese restaurant at HillV2 away from a lot of crowded areas. We visited it over one of the weekends and we did have to wait for a while before we got a table. The service is good at this place and the quality of food very good. The staff are dressed up in traditional Japanese costume. I had their house sake and it was very decent. The place is quiet and you can certainly have a good conversation while having your lunch or dinner. Overall, a very decent Japanese restaurant

I have been to HillV2 Mall several times since it opened in recent months, and have walked past this Japanese restaurant on the second floor. I came by with my colleagues one afternoon for lunch. When I flipped the menu, I was greeted with a photo of Singapore’s first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew with the British Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair with the culinary team of another Japanese restaurant. The head chef of this restaurant has served both leaders previously in his previous restaurant. Here are the highlights of our meal:- Wagyu Don: $24.80. The restaurant uses Grade A4 Kagoshima Waygu beef, which has good marbling and rich flavour. This is a signature dish and you break the half boiled egg onto the beef and mixed it all up with the rice. The beef is tasty due to the marbling and the sauce. Its nice. Highly recommended!- Sashimi: $30. We had the special for the day - Kodai fish, which is silver seabream. The whole fish is done sashimi style and nicely presented on a serving plate. Its served with some nicely rolled and cut Japanese pickles and ponzu sauce. The sauce adds a light vinegar taste unlike the usual soya sauce which will mask the tasteof the delicate fish. The fish is firm to taste and has a good bite. Nice!What’s good is that the restaurant arranges for their seafood to be sent 2 to 3 times weekly to ensure quality and freshness. They have a ‘3-day rule’, where they only sell them as sashimi no more than 3 days after they have been caught. - Sashimi: $7.80. We also had 5 pcs Salmon sashimi, which is fresh and firm. Nice.- Kinsa roll: $14.80. This is the restaurant’s signature roll, a reverse sushi roll with avocado and cucumber in the middle and wrapped with salmon on the outside, which is then ‘aburi’ed (blow torched before adding Japanese mayonnaise and topped with ebi roe. Its nice. What I also liked were the salmoe roe with Japanese mayonnaise at the ends of the plate that’s also ‘aburi’ed. Must-try!- Dragon roll: $14.80. A jumbo prawn deep fried in the middle of the sushi roll and wrapped on the outside with mango and avocado, and topped with ebi roe. I liked the presentation with good blend of colors. Also taste good. Try it!- Foie Gras Soup: $6.80. Wow. This is a first for me. Its served in a regular chawanmushi bowl with lid and saucer. I opened the lid and was greeted with pieces of grilled foie gras floating on the surface of the soup. There was grated daikon (radish) and straw mushrooms in it too. It was interesting to eat foie gras in a soup! The grated daikon in the soup helps to eliminate the oiliness of the foie gras, similar to the way you add it to the your dip when you eat tempura, Try it!- Kanpachi Kama: $16.80. This is grilled collar of Amberjack fish. The fish is nice, and I ate most of it without any need to dip into soya sauce, as it had good flavour. Nice!We ended the meal with 2 Japanese Mochi Dessert, a black sesame mocha and white sugar icing coated mango mocha. Both were nice.Although they are not located in the City area, but in a mainly residential area, I think what they have to offer is good and I believe they will have a stream of regular customers, who know quality food when they taste it.I will be back here again.Recommended

We decided to try this place as it was near our home. It has some rather interesting dishes. We tried the onsen tamago. I was expecting it to be served warm but was pleasantly surprised that it was chilled. It tasted excellent especially with the tamago topping. We had sashimi, grilled ika and udon too. The quality and taste exceeded our expectations. Service was great too

The first time I been to kinsa was during my birthday last year, and since then I have been back there countless times. The restaurant does not only serve top quality food but also provide fantastic service together with the brilliant atmostphere makes dining at kinsa an unforgettable exprience. Ambience: situated at a convenient location near Ang Mo Kio mrt at jubilee shopping center. Kinsa sushi is located at the second level giving it a tranquil ambience which is generally suitable for families and couples. They have really nice decorated tatami room, which have to be booked before hand.Service: the service staff were quick to attend to us when we arrived and we're instantly seated. They were attentive throughout the dinner.Some of my favourite dishes include the soo gyu don or aka the pan fried beef on rice. The succulent beef that is charred on the surface together with the center of the beef cooked till medium rare perfection. Paired with caramelised onions that taste of a perfect blend of soyu and sake. Finishing with an onsen egg. My all time favourite dish!Not forgetting their signature sanshoku dragon roll. The sanshoku dragon roll is made using huge king prawns fried till golden brown and rolled with avocados and mangos. Finally it is topped with flying fish roe and drizzled with mentaiko sauce. The rolls were fantastic as the prawn wasn't too oily and the avocado and mentaiko mayo made a heavenly combination.Some of my other favourites includes the prawn tempura roll, grilled scallop with miso, ebi tamper and kasha kasha, which is a sushi roll made with salmon and crispy chips and topped with bonito flakes. The kaki furai, aka the deep fried oyster were also fantastic as they managed to rid the oyster of its pungent smell but at the same time retain the creamy fillings that burst out when you bite through the crispy crust. Price: reasonable, less than $20 for a main course and about $50 for 2 pax to dine. Overall: love this restaurant and would definitely come back frequently in the future! Love to try their omakase soon :

I was around the mall with my gf and chanced upon this restaurant. The outlook of the restaurant looks very authentic and appealing so we decided to went it to try.Surprise to find a neighbouhood restaurant that has a sushi counter. The chief was processing our sushi right infront of us.But as we order few dishes we wanted to change to a bigger table the service staff was very nice in arranging our request.The chicken yakimono we order was delicious. Meat was tender and juicy a good starter before the bento setwe ordered. Bento set was presented to us in appetising manner.Overall the dining experience was excellent
