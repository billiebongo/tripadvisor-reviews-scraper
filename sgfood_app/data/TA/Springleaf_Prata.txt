Nice, comfortable place for a meal or snack. They have a good selection of pratas, thosai, murtabak and other food items. Had the Murtaburger and though it doesn't look very big, the Murtaburger comes with a generous filling of meat. It was delicious and very filing. The curry station where you help yourself to either fish or chicken curry is a nice touch. Ample seats available - they recently extended their shop space to two units. The place was hopping even at 11am on a Monday. Free parking at Railway Mall is also great. Would definitely return to try their lamb shank bryani and pratas. Not the cheapest prata place around but it is well worth a visit or thre

Springleaf has expanded its restaurant and now looks bigger. The offer various kinds if pizza that is being imagination. My friend bought a prays alfredo. You can literally have a pasta in a prata - minus the spaghetti. The others ordered a murtabak, mee goreng, Maggie mee goreng. Food was nice and tasty. Prata was crispy. It's a must try place if you live around Bt. Timah.

The prata here is super crispy. We ordered two pieces of egg and onion at $2.40 each. Their prata is bigger in size than other places. The fish and chicken curry is free flow and self service. My order of umami-50 prata is super yummy. It has luncheon meat, egg, mozzarella cheese and chicken floss at $8.90. The teh tarik is only $1.30. Will come back again to try other fusion prata
