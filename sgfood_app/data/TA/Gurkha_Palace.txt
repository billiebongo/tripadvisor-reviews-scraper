Surprise find while walking around the Little India area. Cosy environment, had the place to myself one Friday lunch.
Items on the menu were well-described, presented in a traditional way, and delicious Service was good also.
Definitely deserve a return visit.

Great Nepalese food at a very reasonable price. The staff are friendly and helpful when ordering. One of the few places in Singapore that you can BYO a bottle of wine and not be charged a ridiculous corkage. We have loved Gurkha Palace every time we visit and will eep going back for more

We have just spent a couple of weeks in Singapore and participated in the passion of Singaporeans of eating food from different cultures. We were taken to the Gurkha Palace by some Chinese friends and thoroughly enjoyed the tandoori starter and the main curry dish. We were waited on by the owner who is a well educated Nepalese man. Friendly and charming.A week later we returned for another dinner. The restaurant was almost full. Mainly Chinese customers with a few Indians. We opted for the same dishes we had partaken of on our previous visit. Wonderful tasty food. Cannot fault the restaurant ambience or the service. Prices are reasonable too.During our two weeks in Singapore we had lots of meals and most of them were very good but the Gurkha Palace was the only restaurant that we visited twice

Went there looking for MoMos and was quite happy with what i got. MOMOs were juicy and tasty. The menu was a mix of nepalese and north indian food. Service was good and the decor of the place is also pretty interesting. I would recommend this place and will keep coming back

It came with a helping of papdoms and mint sauce.They have chicken and prawn also.The prices are reasonable $10 . Try their massla tea ....nice setting and good service..keep going back for different choices..Wont burn a hole in your pocket.Good choice for anyone who wants to try Indian good

We stumbled on this place by accident since we just saw it while walking and decided to try. Gurkha Palace serves very decent Nepalese and North Indian cuisine at a very affordable price. We had the butter chicken, garlic/ butter naan, and cottage cheese with spinach. The food was delectable coupled with warm, friendly and fast service. I will definitely go back to try the rest of their menu.

Took takeaway two veg momo. Very good. Good chutney and good filing. must try. I had the momo after coming home hence were not piping hot. but having in restaurant would be very good and even more yum.

The food items weren't fresh and not well cooked. There was lot of artificial colour in the curry. Overpriced. I am not going there again. Not recommended at all!
5
We ordered the mutton briyani & Gobi Manchurian. There's nothing you'd not like. The good always leaves us wanting more!
You would also love the ambience because it's not noisy and has beautiful pictures.

Amazing restaurent with good traditional nepalese food and a great service must go place if u wanna taste the real Nepalese food:)

I always come back here to satisfy butter chicken cravings! Always good to have some naan and chicken tikka to go along. A win with foreign tourists. Service, however, could improve. Our food took more than an hour to arrive.
5
Great food and butter chicken is my Favourite with briyani mutton. Must try items. Customer service is one of the best in town!!

Interesting wall paper depicting different views of the Himalayas and Nepal. Well cooked meat. Well seasoned tea. Reasonably priced for Singapore. My mum approves of the cooking as well. Quiet with an antique, cosy feel.

Went to Little India with 7 friends for "Fish-head Curry" around Chander Road, and all were either closed that day or doing renovation.We went to the Gurkha Palace and was totally surprised by the quality and selection of dishes. We had a range of dishes for the 8 guests and everyone enjoyed the food and commented on return visits, highly commendable

Stopped in for dinner after a walk down Little India. Had steamed dumplings (Momo), mushroom curry, potato curry (aloo dhum), and Chickpea dhal with rice, garlic naan, and cheese naan. Honey lime drink was nice if rather sweet. Curries were a good flavour although quite salty.Very friendly staff, good ambience.

Don't expect anything fancy. It's a simple place. The story here is the food. And it's great. We ordered vegetarian Samosa for a starter. Was fresh, crispy and tasty, and was accompanied by an interesting sausce.For main course we enjoyed the classical chicken tikka massala and chicken korma. Both dishes were traditional, fresh, very tasty. The korma gravy was smouth and mild. The tikka massala had chunks of green pepper and onion that added crunchiness to the dish.The naan (bread), which was obviously made on the spot, was warm and doughy in the right texture and taste.The only disappointment was the lentil dahl, but we didn't let it ruin a marvelous dinner.
5
the chicken kebabs, especially the yogurt and the mint, takes the cake.
Also try their poori. delightfully surprising.

Great Himalayan and North Indian food served at a good ambience. Good choice for family outing. Great tasty dishes...

My family is here recently. Our two-year-old enjoyed the Pappas, chicken mono and rice. The nana, mutton Curry and vegetable dishes we're also delicious. The restaurant is nicely decorated with beautiful scenes of Nepal and Nepali artifacts. This is a great place to experience good Nepali and Indian khana. I think my son and his Nepalese wife for bringing us to this wonderful place

Sadly this place is teetering on the edge of dreadful.A huge television plays loud Indian pop music the whole time but it fails to distract us from the very mediocre food. The chicken momos were very heavy and the dough too chewy. The signature mutton dish was actively unpleasant with mostly gristle and an overpowering tasteof very high mutton.The promised spices and chillies were bland and virtually tasteless. Even the poppadoms had been sloppily cooked so were half-raw. Even the friendliest of staff cannot redeem this place

Singaporeans are very proud of their food. It is an important part of the local culture. I've probably eaten at 50-60 different places in Singapore and am most definitely still a food newbie here. I love this place! The food is delicious and it is reasonably priced. A Singaporean friend suggested this place a few years back. I hadn't tried Nepalese food before, but I'm grateful my friend took me here. I've made a point of coming here every time I'm in Singapore. Get good directions - it's on the edge of Little India, which can be a little confusing

If you are craving for momos, this is the place to go! The location is not the best and not too easy to find for first time but it is worth it. The menu has a lot of variety serving North Indian and Nepali dishes and the price is very affordable. The place is clean and the service is excellent! I have visited this place four times since I discovered it.
5
We had a variety of items to share: Chicken, lamb, rice, curry, naan, and salad. With main meat staples for 10-12$, it was a great bargain. What's better? The taste. Tender meats excellently seasoned. Wine for 7$ a glass, plus beers and spirits.In Little India? Go here. Not in Little India? Go here anyways

I had Nepali food for the first time in my life. This place is very busy, so getting a table might be tricky. However coming to the food the food is awesome especially the authentic chicken preparation. In case of a dessert, I have become a fan of the restraunt

This restaurant has delicious food - every meal we had was fabulous. The restaurant wasn't super busy, obviously only known by locals.

I went there just for Momos. I ordered chicken momos. It lacked flavors and I feel it needs improvement in the stuffing. The menu had more North Indian options than nepalese. Being named "Gurkha", I was expecting authentic nepalese cuisine but was disappointed.

Went to this place to try something new as it is Nepalese and North Indian food. The food took aaaages to arrive, including the drinks. When we did get one of the main dishes we were so hungry that ended up eating it before the other ones arrived, and those took much longer. In total it took at least 45min to get the food. When finally got the food is was a total disappointment. Taste wasn't there. Even at tekka food court can get tastier food at a quarter of the price. The only nice thing was the girl attending us. She was really trying to give a good service and speed up the orders.

We were tired, hungry, so we stopped by n decided to try some Nepali food. So we ordered some momo, chicken tikka, chicken biryani n some naans. The food was delicious. They serves better food than you may think. And the service was very good too, with a lovely balance of helpfulness and professionalism. Try it

We went for lunch on a weekday, place was not busy. The drinks took a really long time to arrive. There were throughout the course of our meal a couple cockroaches crawling around on the dining room floor, which is unsanitary. From my understanding this place is under new management which might explain why it's not as good as it used to be. The food however was good and very tasty, including the vegetarian dishes. I think it's a "Go there at your own risk" type of place

Had dinner here with , some friends so ours was a group of 4, from the time we entered till, the time we left, we were well looked after. The food was exceptional, the chicken tandoori & momo , is a must. Skipping the Momo is a Cardinal Sin. All in all, nice food , with great atmosphere & service.

This used to be one of my favorite restaurants on Race Course but I'm never returning again.My colleagues and I had lunch there recently. Food was average without distinct Nepali flavours (at least the set meal) as were the veggie mom is.Worst of all, my colleague found a cockroach crawling into her food! When we requested for a discount, all the manager did was to waive the $3 service charge.The management change has been damaging to say the least

The restaurant had three tables occupied and all were eating main courses, so it wasn't too busy.We ordered the Chicken Saagwalla and the Lamb dish which was the speciality of the house, a vegetable curry, Rice and a garlic Naan Bread.The lamb and the bread came and we waited for the other dishes. After 10 - 15 mins I asked where was the rest and eventually the rice came and then the chicken dish."Where was the veg curry" I asked ..."oh, we have forgotten it" was the reply...never mind, we will do without it and we started to eat and found the lamb was cold, dry and tough, with almost no gravy, so I sent it back for reheating and the chicken was very average, but the rice and bread were not bad ( very hard to mess these up!)I shared my thoughts with the manager who didn't seem to bothered and we paid and left.Not an experience to be repeated ever again by this reviewer!

I visited this restaurant after having eaten real Nepalese food in Kathmandu. The steamed momos skin are broken and the unique juicy filling in momos was lost. A bit disappointed. The chicken Tikka was good so was the rice which were cooked just right. The price was reasonable. The restaursnt has a nice ambience with comfortable bu table setting but think cos I've eaten Nepalese food in nepal itself just felt it's not the same eating it here. Maybe due to the ingredient available in Singapore. The guy who serve us was friendly and helpful and I appreciate that. Overall, worth a try but don't have too big an expectation
