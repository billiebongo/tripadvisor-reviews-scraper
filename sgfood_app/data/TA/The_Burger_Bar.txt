Like most of the F&B establishments along this stretch of river, it boasts a good view. Food wise they are rather inexpensive, with burgers ranging from $10 to $15, that were pretty decent as well.

We had a fantastic table on the deck to enjoy the sunset. The burgers were great and the drinks were large and very reasonably priced. There were no street touts here, unlike at some of the other places further up Boat Quay.

What a terrible experience today, when we informed the lady at reception, she just ignored and said she will inform the chef and scoffed this feedback.
Never again.

Yes, it's a damn fine burger. Order a hoegaarden in a mug and get a burger to your liking . You will be happy. Repeat if necessary.

The cheeseburger was really good, juicy and flavorful. It went well with my ginger ale! My friend got the mushroom burger and he liked it a lot

Walked past Boat Quay and I was pulled in by their yummy images of their gigantic burgers. I was thoroughly impressed with their service and quick serving of my orders. The burger I had was THE FAT BASTERD which was very value for money and juicy

Not much good to highlight except the great view of the river.The menu looked good so our expectations were high.The waitress really struggled to take the order and refused a request for water.When the order arrived after a significant wait several items were wrong and the burger was close to raw.Both food and service were a fail on this occasion

Great place for a burger of your choice coupled with great sides of spam fries, cheddar fries, truffle fries etc.Great place for a spot of cider and beers as well Next time you at Boat Quay, please give this place a great try.Great service, music and relaxed ambienc

I wanted to get a burger on my own so I got here. The waitress was Really grumpy and pushy. It was Really quiet so there wasnt any reason for her to be. I took the burger with shitake, swiss cheese and garlic alioli and Some french fries on the side. However, They bring you a basket with your fries and your burger squeezed in and that's when I realized why the prizes were so tempting. Then the actual flavour: the burger was 'okay' but the bun had already gone soaking wet by the time I unfolded the paper. The french fries were okay but you could taste they came out of the freezer. Please do not go here if you want a quality burger. It's worth your while to pay a lil extra at the bars next to this one

Burgers were incredible, for only 10 dollars each they really hit the spot. Reasonably priced drinks and the sides were just amazing.Sweet potato fries and onion rings were a dream! Portion sizes are huge, couldn't finish a burger and chips sharing the onion rings.Defo worth a visit for those who want a good filling meal without leaving a dent in your bank balance!
