6 stars service from Keyi - she is patient, helpful, courteous and cheerful. John makes excellent waffles. Compliments to the Chef and team.
Try their margarita pizza - think and crispy üëç. Rainbow cheesecake- very good. Wine excellent.
Catherine is also good.

Salad was okay, but we ordered two kinds and both tasted exactly the same.
The truffle mayo and fries tasted like shrimp for some reason?
The service was good.
But $40 for two salads and a fry is a little much given the quality...

Visited this little corner caf√© twice with my husband and food has always been satisfying and doesn't take long to serve. I like their juicy thick beef patties and melted cheeses. Fries are also nicely done. Waiter was very attentive and considerate.We ordered the Pied Piper burger to share last evening and the cook even helped us cut the burger in half without us asking and waiter also brought out two serving plates.Will definitely return and hope they continue to do well

Went to the Centrepoint branch for lunch. Place is not crowded but food was awesome. Service was alright but food took quite awhile to be served. The price of their drinks is a bit towards the high side. It will be perfect if they reduce the price of their drinks

The burger is amazing! Served on in a classy way but tastes so comfortingly sinful! The cheese sauce with the beef patty is the bomb! Not very cheap but affordable for town area, roughly $15-$20+ per item. They also serves a nice rainbow cheesecake that we did not get to try because we were too full from the burgers

Ollie‚Äôs BBQ Pork Burger ($17.90) is our favourite with its thick and juicy pork patty on tomatoes, caramelised pineapple and lathered in BBQ salsa. The sweet and tangy pineapple helps to cut the greasiness, which further enhances the flavour. Another option is the Teriyaki Chicken Burger ($17.90) with a delectable combination of red onion, citrus mayo and sesame seeds. Each burger is huge and it is almost impossible to get a complete mouthful in a single bite. Most of the burgers are less than $20 ‚Äì we are talking quality burgers that are pocket-friendly too!On top of a good range of burgers, there are also breakfast, salad and grill items for you to choose from. Pair it with coffee ‚Äì the baristas make a really good cappuccino

I am writing this review for Ollie Kitchen & Bar which is located in the CentrePoint #33M.The food selection was good and we have ordered Ollie's Classic burger, Steak burger, and Shrimp Pasta. The presentation and the taste of the food was really good. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The service was also impressive with friendly staff looking after us and always attentive to customers in the restaurant.The place was really clean and inviting

At least check out their La Marzocco Strada. Its a giant compared to what you normally see in the average local cafe Coffee is decent.Ambience is gentle and lovely on a weekday as the mall is yet to be crowded. A place to go to to hide away from the crazy heat and crowd

Small space. With a few tables but the food menu is rather extensive. Burgers, salads and breakfast specials. I went for the egg benedict and hot chocolate orange. Hollandiase sauce was good . Of the right salty sour balance. However eggs were too runny. Could be been slightly "harder".. The couple next to me ordered burgers and looked yummy and sinful! Cheese was ooZing out! With huge chunky fries the side.
