The set lunch was good value. But their panna cotta was way too stiff: a sign that too much gelatine had been added. REDUCE the gelatine!!!

Great food, great ambience and great service! Good place to relax and enjoy ~ Enjoy the Mozzarella Salad, be it alone or with friends, with fresh ingredients~~!

The pork collar, veal , tenderloin and cod were very good. Enjoyed the service. Nice place. Pleasant surroundings. Just thought there would be a set dinner menu for Christmas though.

Dears,I tried today "tagliatelle con sugo al peperoncino e pomodoro". I specifically asked to do not exceed with sauce and to let me have a real Italian balanced taste.What did I get?Tagliatelle floating in the sauce with a superb dose of garlic inside. There was no taste fusion between several ingredients.Sorry, not eligible as Italian dish and I think it shouldn't been listed in the menu with an Italian.Grissini: they are good instead, but definitely not worth to go there just for such kind of bread

My boss and I had lunch in Grissini and both of us could not decide what to have and the service staff was not so good in recommending the dishes. Here comes the Executive Chef, David Toh, he was very kind to recommend the food and explained to us in detailed. He came back twice to our table to ensure we were enjoying our food and he is indeed a great chef we have ever met. We will be back soon for the food Chef David, see you soon

Our first night in Singapore we were tired after a busy day so we ate at the hotel restaurant. We both had very generously sized pizza. Crust was nice and the toppings adequate. Wine was nicely chilled and very expensive as it is all over Singapore. Service was good
3
Overpriced and disappointing. We went for a bit of a splurge here, but Grissini failed to deliver on a number of accounts. It quickly became apparent that we were a major inconvenience, (not guests at the hotel - but had booked via their website). Most guests were seated at another restaurant in the Grand Copthorne Waterfront, and generally were part of the many tour groups, consequently the high demand on the wait staff and kitchens meant they were unable to cope with the demand.What we had was poor, although the vegetables were probably plated long before the fish / steaks were ready, and therefore were quite cold. we made a decision not to do anything about it - not certain what would have happened in the hectic atmosphere anyway. I tried to pay and had to really be assertive in order to get the check and even more so to pay - in the end we paid cash as apparently paying by credit card would have been too difficult. Mmm......Disappointing all round, on what should have been a special night
3
My last time ate at Grissini was few years back before they moved to ground level. Ambiance better than before where not so big and bright. Staffs were helpful and polite. However noImprovement on food. Ordered pea soup-tasteless. Tenderloin and pork chop using same sauce. It would be better if you have different type of sauce to choose. Doneness was okay. In addition, the sauce doesnâ€™t taste nice as well. End up we ate the beef with some salt which taste even better than the sauce. Lastly is the dessert-Tiramisu. We thought tiramisu that served in Italian restaurant should be superb however another disappointment. Bailey taste was too strong. Honestly I can easily find a better tiramisu elsewhere. Not a bad experience however hope that food taste can be improve. Highly recommend for gathering and chill out with friends. Outdoor seats looks cozy as well.

Classy place and fantastic food. Service was also great. Although restaurant was full, we were accommodated at the buffet restaurant next door. And as an anniversary gift, we were presented a delicious chocolate macadamia tart. We had a Parma ham pizza which was outstanding and a cod which was also great, Super fresh and exploding with flavour. Even the appetiser was good, delicious bread sticks served with basil ricotta cheese. I will definitely be going back for more

Went with a group of 12 for a private event. Great day from start to finish, all due to Justin's attention to detail. He was perceptive and attentive, without ever hovering. Timing of the food service was impeccable. And in addition to being a great host, Justin has a wonderful sense of humor. Thanks for overseeing our holiday party
5
First time here and was blown away. Grissini's service was absolutely great from the friendly staff and the pasta and steak was cooked impeccably. Will come back again and would recommend to my friends go patronize
5
Tasty and satisfying meal .. love their ribeye! A little pricey though .. atmosphere is great for special occasions I have to admit.
3
Ordered the mushroom soup and crab tortellini. Both were nicely prepared and fresh though the portions were small. Service was typical Singapore non-attentive service level.
5
I enjoyed dinner despite a tiring day - good Italian food, warm service n relaxing ambience made it enjoyable... happened to visit over a weekend and had a great time with wine and the lovely live band!
3
Casual Italian eatery on the ground floor of Grand Copthorne Hotel with a decent set lunch. Breadsticks are served with herb butter.We tried the Caesar salad and the mozzarella ham salad which came with a big portion of mozzarella cheese. The main course choices should satisfy most. I had the Bianca pizza which was a very generous portion and was tasty. The sea bass was a tad dry.The winner has to be the dessert which you can get for $4 more (2-course lunch for $28 and 3-course for $32). The zuccotto was the best - ice cream in an oreo shell with caramel topping!Service was somewhat slow and the wait staff seemed to be unavailable most of the time. Water wasn’t topped up in a timely way and courses came at a very measured pace. The lunch took 2 hours which isn’t good for the office crowd
5
Was recommended by a friend to dine here and it was my husband’s birthday coincidentally, so we decided to with the venue. Instantly wowed by their rocket salad. Usually not a fan of balsamic dressing but they made it so different and refreshing (already craving for it now)! Pizzas were freshly baked too! Service staff was quick and attentive. Was having a cold and they made sure my cup of warm water and lemon was refilled every time without my order. Hope to be back soon

I dined at Grissini earlier in the week at a private event, where we had a very good feast. The squid ink king crab tortelli was excellent, as was the beef tenderloin done just right even though the restaurant had not asked about "doneness".Thus I decided to return with a companion for Sat lunch - which coincidentally, was the first time they were open for lunch on a Sat. The weekday set lunch was, however, disappointingly, not available. So we ordered a la carte. The beef didn't turn out too well though, and the pork collar was a tad tough. But they replaced the beef and all was well. The mushroom soup out of s teapot was very good though - rich, creamy smooth and tasty. The lemon tiramisu reminiscent of lemons and the Amalfi coast was excellent - although it was something my companion was unaccustomed to.All in very decent, although it might be better to go for the weekday set lunch. Perhaps the restaurant should do the set on Sat too, to entice the crowds

If you need a quick italian set meal, this maybe the right place by Singapore River. But do not have a high expectation on the cooked food presented and service delivery here... The restaurant is hidden in the end corner of the hotel away from busy international seafood buffet at Food Capital
1
Food here brings shame to Italy. I am shocked that others had good experience here. Perhaps we were just unlucky. even if you can't cook, you should be able to buy good ingredients and this is certainly possible in Singapore. The prosciutto and salami tasted stale and the cheeses were of really low quality. we asked for bread and we were given some stale rolls from the buffet. The grilled octopus were not fresh. The lobster on the lobster pasta was half cold and chewy. it tasted like it came out of a microwave and cooked separately from the sauce. we couldn't get out of the place fast enough. At best, this is chain store quality at high end price. If I could give a zero star for this place, I would. We had a voucher and paid 65$ for a 165$ meal. But even for $65 it is is a waste of our time
2
The course is too much fatty to us. Must think a little more healthy and light. This style of dinner is outdated and no more attractive at all. The worst thing of this restaurant is very slow service. It took forty five minutes for them to serve the first appetizer plate. Even it was Friday night, not acceptable at all especially for the business party. How can we excuse my guests
3
Service is cordial. My favourite food is spring chicken. The meat is not hard and dry. The rest of the meals are a bit salty, especially caesar salad.
4
Top marks to the chef. I had the lamb and it was perfectly prepared. Service was quick and friendly. I recommend stopping by Grissini if you are in the area.
5
Great lobby restaurant with some very good fusion cuisine, a large group and we all shared, the pizza and fried rice were outstanding with nice house wines and very good service, good value for money in a great location for a business group
5
We ate @ Grissini & had fantastic food, wonderful attentive staff to look after us . It was an enjoyable evening! Thanks to Justin & his amazing staff!
3
I must say the food is very average, barely 'italian'. Soup was very watered down a lot resulting in loss of flavour. Ordered a veal cheek which was over done. The fish came with a fishy smell - definitely not the freshest.
5
Capellini with Boston lobster is a must order!! The mozzarella with parma ham was also really good.
Service was very prompt and professional.
Will definitely return!
5
Dine in with my friend yesterday night , very good environment and excellent service , the most important thing is the food they're serving is delicious ! Thumbs Up ! Will go back again soon !
5
Hosted a group of overseas friends from Mauritius at Grissini last week. Everyone enjoyed the dinner very much, especially the beef tenderloin and the deserts Lovely ambience with excellent quality of service and food. Thank you! Will definitely be back!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ five stars

Grouchy looking waitresses and poorly trained. Does not know how to open bottle of wine and pour. Reminded me of my earlier visits to China when the waitresses pour wine like water! Service-inattentive and I have to raise my hand to call for attention many times. Otherwise Food quality is good
4
The moment we stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted by friendly staff who showed us to our table of 8 pax which was lovely set up in the cozy corner. We ordered Burrata, Mozzarella, Swordfish, Salmon, Octopus and even a pizza as starters. The taste of the octopus was great with right amount of seasoning! The F&B Director personally came to take order of our main course and patiently introduced the menu which has many new items. I ordered a pasta, Tagliolini, which has a rich and creamy egg sauce. It can be a nice comfort food . Towards the end of the dinner, I had a tiramisu as dessert, which has surprised me of its not so normal tiramisu taste. I like it. Grissini, definitely a great dining experience and a satisfying tummy to want to come back for more
5
Excellent food, good value for money, service was very good, wonderful atmosphere for a birthday celebration dinner!
4
Good food, pleasant and friendly service. The restaurant is tucked away inside the Grand Copthorne Hotel.
3
The food portions were a little small and the clams in the spaghetti vongole were sandy. Otherwise the flavour of the meals were good and in some cases quite imaginative. The service was very pleasant and welcoming.
5
Trying the restaurant the first time and what a surprise! Food quality is excellent. Had Angus beef and it's one of the best I had. Tiramisu is also good. The pizza is without a doubt cooked in a wood fired oven. Will come back again.
5
Over all was good .. they got set also ,the food n service was excellent.We enjoy eating there... the service from manager Subramaniam was good 5 star service ...he friendly...nice type of person...I enjoy having lunch there..my guest also happy..we will come back there again
5
The wine dinner is exceptional! The food and wine are awesome! The highlight of the dinner is the Jasper Grilled Grass Fed Nebraska Sandhills Angus Beef Tenderloin with 2009 Humboldt Cabernet Sauvignon - Cabernet Franc.
The service and ambiance are great too!
5
We had a pasta and a pizza dish. Fantastic. The pasta was perfectly al dente. The pizza was also delicious. Perfect crust.. a lovely crunch and the toppings went very well. Highly recommended if looking for a nice place for Italian food.

Pretty new to contemporary Italian, we have Grissini a try during our staycation at Grand Copthorne Waterfront on 12 August 17. I would say that everything we ordered have exceeded our expectations. The grilled spring chicken is so juicy and flavourful, the king crab meat stuffed in the ravioli is very fresh and refreshing to the palate. The sauce exuded full seafood goodness. We especially love the porchetta pizza. Lovely variety of cheeses... Buffalo cheese, parmesan slices and fresh mozzarella with pork belly.. Could not decide on desserts so ordered both the tiramisu and panna cotta. They are unique compared to many Italian restaurants we tried. A scoop of sorbet was served on top of the desserts. It's veey refreshing to clear the palate and having some sorbet after each mouthful of the rich dessert is an awesome contrast. Both the desserts were smooth, thick and satisfying. We will be back for more! Thank you, dedicated chef and service staff at Grissini!!

We have always liked the food here. It's a pity the waiters do not cover the whole restaurant and check the guests right at the end of the restaurant. I had to surpressed the urge to walk to the front to order my food after many attempts to catch the waiters' attention
4
The set lunch is good value (upgraded to spring chicken for $10) plus we are anyway in hurry so service (other than time) less important! Dinner was so so mainly due to service. When asked about various items on the grill menu the manager simply said "they're different kind of pork". Had to Google for more sensible answer!. But they did offer me a city guest discount. So that made it up. Good points:1. Excellent wine selection. Wines by glass (red) was quite good.2. Grissini very tasty!3. Food taste quite decent although not extraordinar
4
The booking info from chope was delayed so their system reflected 4 pax while I actually changed to 6 pax. They immediately arrange the table. The waiter also mistaken taken my order. I wanted Grilled salmon but they serve seabass instead.
4
Always wonderful greeting from the staff and made us felt totally at ease in the comfortable environment.
5
Executive 2-course set lunch @ $19++. Good service, good food and conducive environment for lunch meeting.
4
Food was very good,value for money with the Millennium Alacarte Card, good atmosphere with good service.
Thank you!
3
The soup and main course were average but the dessert was good. Overall, good value for money though.
3
Service wise, our hostess was great being friendly in initiating conversations and knowledgeable with the food. However the dishes we ordered were average in taste for the prices. But that was just 3 dishes, we could have missed the better ones on the menu.
5
Grissini is an excellent Italian restaurant with lots of fresh ingredients flown in from Italy. Chef Anthony heads this restaurant and does an excellent job serving great dishes. Earlier in the year the restaurant served a rock salt baked fish which had to be ordered in advance. It was truly a great dish. Heard they'll be bringing it back later in the year.This time I ordered the asparagus set menu (seasonal) and it was not just great, it was value for money. My main was an beef fillet that was cooked medium raw with the inside soft and creamy. The starter of Parma ham and asparagus kicked the dinner off well. By the way Grissini has a wide selection of wine and spirits that satisfies all kinds of drinkers.
5
Another wonderful dinner at Grissini.+ Nice lounge music++ Attentive and great service from Subra and Ted++ Great tasting foodWe ordered:* Spring Chicken from Josper grill - tender and juicy* Vegetarian pizza - small is good for 4 ladies to share* Penne arrabiata - made al dante and taste good (not overpowering with tomato sauce)* Hazelnut Tart - a must tr

We always follow our favourite Singapore maÃ®tre d', Subra.He asked us to come down and check-out some of the latest innovations at Grissini.We had 3 weeks in Italy last year and we were keen to see how authentic Grissini is.We were not disappointed.Subra and his team looked after us brilliantly. The house specialty of grilled octopus was fantastic !!!!Our waitress Sunny Seo was also excellent. She was knowledgable, responsive, with a lovely personality.The Merlot that Subra recommended was wonderful.We'll be back soon with a group of our friends to enjoy this great restaurant

Ambience & Welcome: Nicely done up. Chic, without being overly formal.Food: Complimentary Grissini (breadsticks) were delicious. Starters were ok, not brilliant. Had the caprese and the octopus tartareThe chicken pizza which was quite average.The wagyu steak and the grilled cod really sang. Both were well seasoned and prepared. Purple sweet potato gnocchi comes highly recommended.Desserts were a hit and miss. Go for the ice-creams particularly the truffle and olives.Service: Overall service was patchy. Some staff were friendly and helpful. Others less. Towards the end of the meal it felt like they were disinterested. Staff couldn't explain why I didn't qualify for their 30% May offer on CHOPE even though it was published on the app.Worst of all, when I requested for two parking coupons after I signed the bill, the staff shot back brusqely: "We only give one for every minimum spend of $80" - And I spent more than 3x that amount.Needless to say, it was a terrible way to end a birthday celebration
5
Arriving from our whole day tour, we decided to drop by before heading to our room. Ordered the Singapore Sljng and Mex Coffee with Tequila, it was prepared to perfection! You get 30% off if you're the guest of he hotel. We enjoyed
3
Looking for a light lunch we had the choice of Grissini or a buffet. Picked the chicken pizza, but there wasn't much chicken, disappointing.
5
Am not a fan of Italian cuisine but Grissini made me one! The food is amazing, always well prepared & tasty... service staff are friendly & good at giving recommendations! Ambience is great & that makes dining very relaxing!

I confess..I was a bit of a fan for its predecessor, Pontini's. So when I finally decided to visit Grissini, I was expecting the same service and perhaps even better food given the restaurant's attempts to highlight its chef and their special wood oven. Firstly, locating the restaurant came as a bit of a surprise and perhaps a bit confusing. Grissini shares the same space as the hotel cafe'. So, you have to join the queue for the cafe but indicate you are heading to Grissini's. The demarcation between the cafe and Grissini is subtle (perhaps deliberate? so as to extend the cafe if needs be?)Secondly, I was encouraged to make my reservation online - which I did and I received a confirmation by email. However, when I was at the reception, they could find my reservation. Had to whip out the iPhone and troll for the email confirmation. To be fair, the reception was courteous and when they saw me trying to look for that email, they gave me the benefit of a doubt and allowed me to proceed to a table.Thirdly (and perhaps most importantly), the food was so ho hum. I ordered the oven cooked squid and it was unexciting. Even my dinner companions all had raised eyebrows about the food. The pizza was..well..enough said..! Perhaps it might fill a hungry traveller who just checked in and who just wants some food. Not a place to impress guests who want fine dining. The waiters were attentive - and that was the only saving grace. Ok, the other saving grace was that the food was not too pricey..pretty affordable. I do miss Pontini's though..
4
I have been to Grissini a number of times and have always enjoyed my meals there. The food is good and the service staff is very attentive. Once, my reservation was not captured in the system and they had a full house when we reached there. But the service staff tried their best and somehow managed to put in an extra table for my wife and I. Their effort is certainly very much appreciated. Food wise, I like the beef tenderloin and octopus. The pizzas there are also recommended
5
Had lunch with a colleague from Belgium at Grissini as he was staying at Grand Copthorne. We decided to order ala carte as the set lunch was too heavy going on a working Monday, although the price was very reasonable for a 3 course meal. My colleague ordered the seabass while I had cod. Both of us had a very memorable meal - the dishes were absolutely delicious, well presented and unique taste. Service was also impeccable - the staff were attentive, friendly and helpful and the restaurant has a very pleasant ambience and private feel to it although it was an open concept. Definitely highly recommended ....and the price was very reasonable too for such fantastic food and service. Grissini is one of my top go-to Italian restaurants in Singapore!

Grissini, located in the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel is an open-concept, Ambience yet cozy and inviting, with modern contemporary decor around the place. The atmosphere takes a more sophisticated class, warm lighting with dark wooden furnishings on plush carpets, with heavy curtains against the windows. There is also al-fresco outdoor seating, though it's not suitable on warm or wet days. Service at Grissini, is fantastic, worthy of fine dining status. Staff are professional, engaging, and efficient. They offer greetings upon entry, and are quick to seat guests. Staff will brief you on the various sections of the menu, and helpfully make recommendations if asked. Big plus for the staff ,they come around to check on your dining experience, Food at Grissini, is southern Italian cuisine,( which I love ) and includes a range of rotisserie / grilled meats, fresh seafood, salads, main courses, , desserts, , and more. The highlight here would be the josper grilled meats and seafood. My favorite delicious dishes are the Boston Lobster Linguine, Grilled Spring Chicken and Grilled Octopus. A perfect Italian night. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon
5
Organised and had a company lunch at Grissini. We were unsure of what to order at first but under the recommendations of the the service staff, we ordered some of their appetizers, main courses and desserts. We were simply amazed by how great the food were. Most importantly, the service staffs are very helpful and extremely friendly. Ambience of the restaurant is comforting though the music played can be improved. Overall, perfect place for great Italian cuisines coupled with excellent service
2
Ordered steak medium. Got it medium rare with a fair amount of blood. Outside was nearly well done. Clearly they try to cook the meat too fast. Service, as with the rest of our stay in the hotel, was disappointing. Almost to the point of being rude. We requested a table and was told it was already reserved (mind you we had a reservation as well). Instead we were seated at a highly undesirable table with no view of the water (why we booked) and next to the waiter service station. Of course the table we wanted, which was in view of our table, was never taken. Based on this treatment alone, I would never return. Why have a reservation to be given the worst table in the house
5
Grissini is in the Grand Copthorne Waterfront. It's modern and quite upmarket dining. You have a choice of some set course menus or Ala Carte menu. My Tortelli was great - not big portion but really well prepared and presented. My wife had the Kurobuta Pork Collar Steak which was also really well presented
4
I had Risotto and my husband had chicken, we both really enjoyed it but could have eaten more. Staff very attentive, bit expensive.
4
We had a private room, and had a good selection of squid, lobster pasta, iberico pork, forentino beef. Service was excellent and ambience fantastic.
5
had a chicken meal and rice with option of chopsticks or spoon and fork. Very tasty reasonably priced meal service very good.
4
Closed now Sunday. Thought this hotel was seriously trying to offer something different along this particular stretch of the River.
5
My best treat for a long week. Excellent food, warm service and cosy environment.Ordered: white truffle burrata, porcini papardelle, eggplant tambale, basil ice cream, balsamic ice cream, parmesan cheese ice cream and black coffee.Must try: eggplant tambale and anything else from the Josper Grill. Best!Ice cream flavours motivated us to be creative and step out if our comfort zone.Thank you Subra, John and Hyruddi for your warm and professional service. You made our evening

@TheKuoKnowsMy quest for best pizza in Singapore led me to Grissini at the Copthorne Waterfront Hotel. An unlikely place, you might think, for the famous flatbread with toppings. But how wrong could I be.Grissini has a wide choice of pizzas. I opted for the vegetarian Primavera, which was both a delight to the eye and a burst of flavour on the palate.Who would have thought than a thin-crust base with cheese and lashings of vegetables could be that tasty? But it was.The Spaghetti Carbonara was deiciously al dente. Perfectly creamy. Probably one of the best I have in Singapore.Grissini is seriously good. The people at the next table were about to dig into a whole baked salt crust fish. I can't wait to give that a try next time.
5
first time visiting with my family and we were surprised by the service and food.The Manager on duty Mr.Subra (hope i got it right), was very friendly and had great attention to details and even recommended some food items.Hats Off to the gentlemen.The asparagus soup was good and so was the smoked dried mozzarella.The main was seabass and spring chicken.The fish was succulent .The chicken was a bit on the pinkish side and the ratte potato was dry and hard which I didnt touch after a bite.A little let down on this dish but overall experience was awesome.Will definitely go back to try other dish and of course for the service.Cheers guys

Not only has the Waterfront Grand Copthorne had a revamp, they have also changed around their restaurants. Pontini the fine dining Italian restaurant has closed and the new Italian restaurant Grissini is now located on the ground floor. If you like thin crispy pizzas then this may not appeal as it is more doughy - also the toppings could have been a bit more generous. Service is very good and since they've made the atmosphere more relaxing - it has attracted a larger cliente

Grissini is located in Grand Copthorne Waterfront hotel and they specialize in Southern Italian food.The interior and decorations of the restaurant is very extravagant and gives a very grand feeling. Ideal place for business dinners or to impress someone.Our group ordered salad, pasta, pizza and seafood. The food was relatively blend and lacked flavors.On the plus side, the serving of the food was rather generous
5
Grissini is a great restaurant. The private room is amazing. Service is outstanding.I tried the crab pasta and it was really great and so it was the sea bass cooked under salt. Certainly a place to go for italian food in Singapore. Well done guys
