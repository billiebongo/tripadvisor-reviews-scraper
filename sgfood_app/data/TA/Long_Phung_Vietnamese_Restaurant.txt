Went with buddy to dine there after hearing of it for sometime. This restaurant has exceeded my expectations on Vietnamese food compared to those I had back in Phu Quoc. Awesome and it's worth for another visit soon.
4
Got busy even before the opening filling up place upon opening.
It’s definitely good idea to wait. Food is very good, place clean and witch such a great customer turnover you will get super fresh food
Would go back again

This restaurant serves one of the best and most authentic Vietnamese food in town,. Service is efficient but the food is really awesome. You have to try it out......you will not be disappointed. It is definitely a place to tuck in for the foodies.
5
I’ve been on Long Phung twice and the beef stew doesn’t let me down. I also like their fresh mango salad. The amount of serving of their dishes can be shared for 2. And their price is quite right for the servings. Superb overall dining experience at Long Phung. Will definitely fo back for their beef stew
1
B for the food , unfortunate F for the service Service staff needs you to beg them to eat at the restaurant In the competitive food market in Singapore , take your hard earn money and I am sure you can find as good a Vietnamese restaurant with better service standardsDefinitely don't bring anyone here for a special occasion

Never knew that there was a little Vietnam in SG??!?!? Well don’t think it’s official, the hotel porter put me onto Joo Chiat rd... anyways... hearing proper viet on the sidewalks and viet music coming out of some shops was kinda strange in SG. Walked passed this busy viet Restaurant and ordered myself a Pho Thai, Bun chả giò and viet coffee... size was small flavour wise I’d say the bun was on the mark however the pho was watered down and missing flavour. I don’t think I’m biased but so far the benchmark is still back home. Anyways was good to wonder through another part of SG.. although a bit seedy when the sun goes down. I wasn’t game to test out how good my travel insurance was so no bars with skin tight hot pants waitresses for this solo intrepid.

Grabbed a quick lunch here in my last few hours in Singapore. I tried visiting on the first night I was here but the queue was pretty long. Whilst I was stood in it I saw a sign saying that they only accepted cash. Worth noting if you are someone like me who prefers to make card payment and at the time had no cash on me! On my visit I had roast pork with veg and rice. Simple and delicious!
3
The pho dac biet was a huge disappointment. Broth was ok but they added a raw egg which changed the texture and clarity of the soup. Noodles were soft and turned the soup mushy towards the end of the meal. Beef balls and beef slices were over cooked and tough. All the vegetables are added directly in the soup when it arrives rather then served as sides.Avoid the pho and go for the bun bo hue instead
4
Read about good reviews for Longp Phung Viet restaurant and gave it a shot last weekend. As a former expatriate living in HCMC, the taste is v good but not really authentic compared to those in Vietnam. Guessed it may have been localised to suit Spore diners' taste buds.. It was fully house and the crowd testify it.
3
The Long Phung restaurant in Joo Chiat Rd, is a open secret in Singapore. Food is good, it doesn't have any Michelin Stars so don't expect top class service. I keep in mind "Don't Expect and don't get disappointed" But now please to report Long Phung is aircon'd. Fare is slightly cheaper than the Viet restaurant in Parkway Parade. However, I prefer my Viet roles to have thinner skin.
3
Tried the Bahn Mi and I do regret that decision. The noodles and spring rolls are nice with all the fresh vegetables and herbs
4
Spring roll and the soup was excellent.
I would visit again to have other dishes as well.
The price is also reasonable.
5
Hands down, best authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Singapore. I’ve asked a number of my Vietnamese friends and they all recommended Long Phung. I had summer rolls, pho and garlic cockles. Rolls and pho was as expected (amazing) but the cockles were the real winner. I wasn’t sure what to expect but it was so good that we ordered another plate.
5
Ordered the pho with glass noodle as well as pork mee hoon. Ordered the fried popiah n the clear popiah. The food is simply awesome.Ordered the Tamarind drink to match the wonderful food. Carpark is just behind with ample lots here at Joo Chiat road. Look at my photos posted. Mark it down in your calendar to visit this place yea
4
Really authentic feel of the whole dining experience. The food was good too. We had the pork chop on rice and fried chicken wings with a garlic chili sauce. The pork chop was tender and nicely marinated. Chicken wings are a tad over fried. But the sauce more then compensated on the lack of juice. The environment was noisy and feels like I was dining in Ho Chih Min city. Be prepared to queue for a table if you arrive after 6pm.
4
When with my wife , last visit this Restaurant was in Dec.2015.Food remain at affordable price .Till long Queue that show the food Good haha .Must try Beef Noodle and Spring Roll serve crispy and Fresh .Also their Vietnamese Ice Tea very refreshing taste .There are many item to choose from .Attached photo
2
Ordered a bowl of chicken & bamboo shoot noodles for myself, I hated it because most of it was vegetables and not noodles. I remember the portions in Vietnam were big and definitely not did not have as much vegetables. The fried spring rolls were hard, tiny and had little fillings, would have liked it better if there were more cellophane noodles in it too.
4
This my second visits to this corner Vietnamese Restaurant at Joo Chiat Road. Food presentation so-so but food taste is the most important criteria for me. Ambiance wise not that impressive, service staff not pushy. To get off the congestion best time to go is during lunch hour (after 2 pm). Shop open from 11 am to 2 am on all days.Go for the original pho Tai which I always enjoyed together with the Vietnamese spring roll. A must for my both visit. Can also try the So huyet xao sate (cockles) very yummy.Like the soup and very tasty
4
We went to long Phung because of trip advisor rating . Restaurant was full of local and very busy even before 7 pm. The staff was ok but not that welcoming . The pho were delicious , the spring rolls so so ... But we had overall a good experience . May be getting a bit overrated.
3
Just couldn't fathom the crazy long queue for this place. Pho Tai just tasted average, with just a measly amount of beef slices. Rice paper spring roll was crap - tough and hardened texture that made me think it was made ages ago. The only dishes that stood out were the sweet and sour chicken wings and fried spring roll. Avoid the iced milk coffee at all costs!!! They even dared to serve coffee that is half a cup full with the remaining filled with ice!! This is clearly a bloody ripoff at $3.80 a cup. Price is affordable but I'm definitely not returning considering the standard of food here, combined with the hot, cramped and uncomfortable seating here. The electricity even went off twice while we were eating
3
From three years ago, the quality has come down.
- No longer serve fresh lime with pho, they instead provide some cheap artificial colored sour water
- beef quality provided with pho is very poor
+ broth is still very good and flavorsome
4
We were invites by friend for dinner, the location was ok the food excellent, we had delicious dishes there. we will surely go back again.
4
My family came here for dinner on a Saturday night around 630pm and was quickly seated. There were many good choices of. Vietnamese dishes available .
The service was great and prompt. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for great Vietnamese foods and drinks.
5
This is my family's third visit to this no-frills restaurant. Hence, we learned our lesson: 1. Q up at least 5-10 mins before the restaurant opens at noon. Once inside, the authoritative waitress will tell you, "Sit down!" as though you were a primary school child. Don't be 'turned off' by that attitude. Our server was much more pleasant and courteous (thank goodness!).2. A huge sign-board with their signature dishes and prices stands erect outside the restaurant. While Q-ing up, do already decide on your dishes, instead of flipping through the menu inside the restaurant. By 12.20pm, the restaurant was full, and a Q was forming outside. Some metacognitive skills will aid you (and your guests) tremendously. 3. Do order the raw beef pho, pork cutlet rice with egg, spring rolls-fresh and fried, mango salad, and mango smoothie. Heavenly!4. Do bring sufficient cash because this restaurant does not accept any other kinds of payment. Our total bill came up to about S$55 (no GST); value for money indeed
5
Don't expect flash & wow... great value, fantastic food.. I love the wings and cockles in lemongrass/citronella. I live the way the staff shout out and the Organised chaos... I just wish I could BYO a bottle of white wine and I'd eat here every week
2
This place used to be very good few years ago. This is the second time I'm coming here after I found service and quality dropped. Today we were served the drinks 30min after ordered. We finished our main dishes and the drink haven't still come. 35min to serve spring roll..Portion has been reduced... Bad attitude of staff... I don't think I will come anymore. I used to like this place very much but there are other Vietnamese restaurant easier accessible and having better service keeping same tasty food.
5
After touristy Raffles we headed to a no frills very busy Vietnamese restaurant. We ordered a whole array of food including tasty phos and some seafood dishes. Not many tourists, fast service and great food. I discovered the coconut smoothie, I would recommends it to anyone
4
Took a train trip to Paya Lebar. Headed to Joo Chiat road and called in at Long Phuong eatery where we had chicken Pho ( chicken noodle soup). Simply gorgeous.Opened at mid day, but be there after 11am and get in the queue else you will have to wait
4
Long Phung Restaurant is located at 159 Joo Chiat Road, and it would be the most popular one along Joo Chiat Road. This restaurant is not easily accessible by MRT or bus. It is hard to get a parking spot as well. Like a typical roadside eatery in Saigon, Long Phung features a simple interior with cramped setting. The place is often packed out, so there is always a queue in front of the restaurant during peak times. There is a decent sized menu offered at Long Phung. Half of the menu is made up by around 30 dishes of noodles soups and rice and the other offers Vietnamese usual appetizers and side dishes such as spring roll, papaya salad, and cockles. Prices are very reasonable, with Cash only policy. The staffs are friendly, nothing out of the ordinary, they will ask how your meal was, which is nice as well. In conclusion I thought this is quite a hidden gem and would definitely return for more scrumptious Vietnamese food again
5
My family are regulars here , I have to get my pho fix at least a couple times a week. They have the best pho here , and their fresh crawfish are to die for . They are definitely worth a try if you like Vietnamese .
3
Generally ok. Ordered a plate of wings, but was disappointed. The only decent dish is pho and spring roll.
5
This place must be very authentic as the Vietnamese also come to this restaurant. I find this place the best amongst all Vietnamese restaurant along Joo Chiat road. Love the dry noodle pork dish and pho .
4
There is a queue outside the restaurant during lunch time that only disappears after 1pm. The reason is simple: good quality food at reasonable price. Pho is only $7-8 here while the CBD eateries charge $11-12 and the quality offered y Long Phung is much better. There is also a big varieties on the menu that can make everyone happy, even the kids.
1
I came for the Phở, the Vietnamese noodle soup consisting of broth, rice noodles, herbs, and meat, primarily made with beef. Here, don't touch the beef; it's full of sinews. The amount of coriander put into the soup made me finally say no to Phở.The good thing with the restaurant was the kind staff although they didn't dare not to charge me for the miserable Phở.
4
There are a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in Joo Chiat....this one is the best. $7 for most noodle soups and dishes.We had cockles in citronella herbs / lemongrass, noodles and beef, duck noodle soup...ice coffees (pack a caffeine punch that will keep you awake for 3 days)...lemon juice with ice (ask to have half sugar or none at all)...food comes out quickly but not at same time.It's cooked fresh and tastes great....there are lots of Asian restaurants in Singapore which use sauces from jars and pour too much on the food, not here.Worth the tripIt's always busy so tip is to go just before dinner or lunchGreat staff and easy going no frills place...plenty of life and noise about the place to make it authentic
4
We used to go to Long phung all the time. Last night there was such a long queue that we decided to walk across adjacent to it. Quan an's food tasted so much better. The place was rather busy too but the food arrived quickly.SKIP the queues and walk across next door to right
3
Our family of 4 ordered 2 beefball and beef slice noodles, 1 pork bun thit nuong, 1 cha gio fried netted spring roll, 1 lemongrass clam soup.All were average except the cha gio was nicely done. Vietnamese drip coffee were strong! Don't expect service here, waitresses were mostly non-smiley and snappy!
4
I have been there several times as this is a restaurant that offers a large choice of Vietnamese dishes. I always enjoyed the food even I have to admit this is not good compared to Vietnamese restaurant in Australia or France. Still on of the best in Singapore.I sometimes notice the soup had a lot of food enhancer. Not always but it happened.
4
Great food - we eat here every month, one of the most authentic Vietnamese around Singapore. Fast and 'furious' service... no polite graces here... but efficient. We like the chicken wings, shellfish in the lemongrass & citronella, spring rolls, Pho, papaya salad. Beer is cold ... but we'd really like to be snake to bring our own white wine... but told no!
3
was told by co-workers, some Viet expats, this the best and authentic Vietnamese restaurant in Singapore. i ordered Bun Bo Hue and was disappointed. broth bland, diluted, and too sweet. maybe i am spoiled from real Viet home cooking. When I went to paid at the counter, I overheard the staff talking loudly to each other in Vietnamese, and the language used was, how do i put it, "lively" :
5
We tried at least 6 dishes and everything is fresh and tasty. Way above the other Vietnamese around. Not a fancy place but worth a try for a reasonable budget.
3
Food is good but the service is absolutely not the same. It shouldn't cost a lot for them to smile a little bit.
4
I must say the taste of most dishes is very very good and authentic Vietnames food. I have tried many Vietnam restaurant in Singapore and this is the best in term of food quality & wide range of food.
4
We were early but by the time we had finished our meal they were lining up out the door. Food was authentic and good value. The decor was very basic. The meal was good value for money
5
Great place with Great food. Staff were very friendly. The cockles and fried chicken was delicious. Highly recommended.
4
Tried the beef Pho noodles soup and spring rolls (both fresh and fried versions), very authentic indeed! The other dishes are also good such as stir fried cockles! However be prepared to wait in line during peak hours and weekends. Service is also not prompt as the crowds packed
5
For a suburban family restaurant this place packs a lot of punch for excellent food quality and value for money. Every single dish we had from the zuzu in coconut to the garlic cockles and the Beef kway tiao was fantastic. It does get busy so go early. Service was fast and efficient. Definitely would go back for another visit
5
I was doing a little bit of research on good Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore and I found this restaurant! Beef noodles are a-mazing! The broth was so flavorful and the beef slices were really tender! You can add chili for an extra kick but that's totally up to you. We had an extra portion of spring rolls - sauce was amazing and not too overpowering and complements the roll very well. To top it off, some iced milk coffee - easily one of the best I've ever had. However, it could be a little sweet for some people. If you're looking for authentic Vietnamese food at reasonable prices, Long Phung is the place to go to. But come early because there WILL be a long queue
3
One of few restos that we went out of our way to visit due to many good reviews which persuaded us to try it. Besides, Vietnamese food is not difficult to enjoy. From the photo menu, we chose the following: pho (beef brisket soup), shrimp roll, water spinach and chicken wings. Everything was superb. Pho was refreshing - comforting soup, tender meat, light noodles. Shrimp roll, when dipped into the peanut sauce, was a delightful appetizer. The water spinach and chicken wings provided the perfect ending. Truly, everything was good - except the service. For some reason, the waitresses just can't get it right - lack of warmth when dealing with customers, wrong order taken. They even conversed loudly (short of shouting) with each other from opposite sides of the resto. It almost turned out to be a stressful lunch affair. Long Phung's saving grace was the food itself. Simply delicious! And it can be seen in the long queue of customers. But service should complement the food. Unless the owners change their definition of good service, Long Phung may find it tough to retain customers
4
Noisy, unpretentious and crowded, this is the real deal, the kind of place that is on insiders' guides, unlike many of the forgettable cafe style joints claiming to serve Vietnamese food. Portions are as big as their taste, great for sharing so you can try a variety of dishes - grilled quail, stuffed chicken wings, the rolls and soupy noodles are all favourites with regulars. Staff are efficient and attentive even if they don't smile much, service is prompt -- no reason to complain really
4
Went for lunch with group of colleagues. Being in a big group, we ordered quite a number of different dishes, I especially like the grilled quail. The fish soup and stewed pork with egg are also good.
A good place for affordable Vietnamese food.
1
The service there is awful and the food is so so. There is a nice uncle working there, but the Vietnamese staffs are ridiculously rude. Definitely won't come here again.
5
Best I've found in Singapore. Well worth the trip East.
Delicious fresh mango smoothie to take the edge of the fiery chili.
5
The place is a small cozy restaurant, good selection of Vietnamese food and drink. Service side do not be offended as sometimes you get the palm but rest assured, your orders will be placed and you will get your food in no time.
4
Authentic Vietnamese food. But prices have gone up since our last visit. Try the Tamarind juice! Can be very busy at times and need to queue.
4
Had a lovely dinner for 2 families, with authentic Vietnamese food at Long Phung. There was a queue when we got there, which shows that it HAS to be good. Especially when there are at least 3 other Vietnamese restaurants close by and only Long Phung has a queue the prices were very reasonable, at $100 for 6 pax, including drinks. Will go again soon
4
A few of us, on a weekend course, happened to have lunch, on two consecutive days. All of us have been to Vietnam, so were looking forward to the meal. We arrived late, there's always a queue. Be prepared to wait. Some people have griped about the non -smiling service. I think the staff are just rushed off their feet. I would recommend the soups and spring rolls, and judging by the orders on the other tables, these seemed to be the most popular. Some rice noodle dishes were a bit dry. Payment is strictly cash so keep that in mind
3
My son and I went all the way to Geylang/Joo Chiat to try what is hailed by the Web as Singapore s top Vietnamese food. It was ...Okayish .. The Pho s flavour is nit as great as expected...the sliced meat was not rare but boiled ..and there was a deficit of herbs !! The other dish ( we tried vermicellis and fried spring rolls ) was also average. On the positive side , the Cuy Tiev ( Phnom Penh Cambodia s Famous noodle soup ) was good and not easy to find in Singapore . Good coffee . Nice and fast service. Not worth a 30 mn cab ride but good value if you are in Joo Chiat
4
This restaurant has Vietnamese cooks and service staff. Felt like being transported to Vietnam. Expect long queue during weekend. Must try the beef pho, special pho and prawn roll. They have many dips and sauces for the various dishes. Service is basic as most staff speak can only speak simple English or Chinese. However if you are here for the food, just enjoy the good spread which is reasonably priced.
1
This used to be a great restaurant... apparently not any more. I ordered the beef stew - instead of beef I only found some old chewy show sole in my stew! The food was horrible, yet the service was probably the worst I have ever experienced in Singapore! The waitress had an attitude, which was obnoxious. She treated us and also the guests on the table next to us like some unwelcome guests who disturbed her routine. There are more than enough lovely restaurants along Joo Chiat - I'll never ever go to this place again
4
Good Vietnamese style food but the duck was a bit on the dry side for our taste. The rest of the dishes were tastfull and ok.
2
Tried the pho and famous grilled pork vermicelli... Really nothing special and bad service made it hard to understand why ppl put up with it.
4
We went on a Sunday lunch and there was already a line outside the small restaurant. Was told to queue outside and that went on for more than 30 minutes. However , food is very tasty , worth the wait.
5
We had their spring rolls with noodles - all very full filling and delicious. I had a jack fruit shake - yummy!!! All in reasonable prices (main dish 7-10 sgd) and drinks between 3-5 sgd. Good quality and value for money!
4
I suggest some planning to get a table quickly, fortunately we arrived just as they opened (12 noon on a Saturday), ten minutes later we would have had to join the queue.We enjoyed the shared starter of chicken wings and fried spring rolls. I didn't think the grilled pork with spring rolls on vermicielli was very good. The grilled pork was dry, I've had this dish much better at other Vietnamese restaurants in Vietnam and elsewhere. However, my companions enjoyed their beef soup very much. The price ($7 to $9 per main dish) was also very reasonable. Payment is cash only
1
This establishment used to be one of my favourites for great Vietnamese food. However, sadly, in recent months, I have found my visits to be a great let down. Not only have the standards of the dishes dropped, the service and staff of this restaurant has also taken a "Thou art not worth my time" attitude. Very disappointed in having been met with such poor manners despite having been a regular patron when I was there last over the extended Labour day weekend with my family. Will certainly NOT be going back there for the declining standard of food, lousy attitude of staff and above all, pompousness of an establishment that has gained too much pride from past success. If you are looking for a great meal at afforfable prices, I highly recommend trying the Vietnamese across the road. Where you will definitely not be met with dismissive hand gestures and shoving.
4
We went there on a Saturday night around 8 pm. There was a long queue outside which took us about 30 min to enter. It definitely worthed waiting in a queue cuz the food was really delicious and not a typical tourist place. The price is cheap considering the quality food which you get. Big prawn rolls and spring rolls are must tries! Would definitely go there again
4
Visited Long Phung at 17:30.Generally this restaurant is very cloudy you should better go before 18:00 then no need to wait.Ordered Beef noodles and Spring roll and tea.They can provide half fried half raw.Spring roll raw is better, fried one not so hot.Beef noodles little bit sweet for me and too much boiled.Total price is $15.If you live near here yes, but not live near hereYou may have another choice
4
As a Vietnamese, I would say this store sells the most authentic Vietnamese food with variety and value-for-money (Mrs Pho sells nice Pho, but there is no other snacks food). The only set-back is that it locates quite far from MRT, so you can't really make frequent trips there. Queue could be long for dinner in weekends, 15mins-20mins queuing. It is air-conditioned inside
5
I come here very often is my breakfast place of solitude, this food is amazing, you can actually taste every ingredient, you can see also the fusion between Vietnamese ingredients and French techniques, very delicate and flavor full at the same time, the service is excellent, a must go!!!
5
I went there for the first time.... Absolutely amazing food... Incredible! Restaurant has a simple setting yet the ladies serving us were always smiling... Brilliant! Can't wait to go back again
3
Lots of different soups (apart from Pho) and the typical noodle and rice dishes. However, service was really bad. Waiters very rude and the toilets are disgusting- no toilet paper, bad smell and very dirty.
4
Went here with my mum and we both had the chicken noodle soup. Lovely food and fast and nice service.
One of the restaurants on Joo Chiat rd with most customers.
Would absolutely recommend the noodle soup!
2
I used to love this place, but it seems it's going down. Food quality used to be much better. Now it's just mediocre Vietnamese food, which the price doesn't justify.
Service could be more friendly as well.
Time to look for a new favorite.
4
Have been there a few times and tried their spring rolls, sliced chicken bamboo shoot noodles, sliced duck glass noodles. The food is awesome but at the peak hours, we have to wait for Long queue and the place was cramped. Recommend to try it non busy hours
5
I've been to Vietnam 3 times and beef pho is a must. So to find authentic and good beef pho is tough in Singapore. Most places I have eaten are seriously alright at best.Long Phung wins them by a mile.Need I say more?The Chicken rice I had wasnt good. Just stick to the beef pho and spring rolls if you re not adventurous
4
Tucked along the busy streets of Joo Chiat which is know for little shops and restaurants serving quality food is a Vietnamese joint serving quality authentic Vietnamese food. The Pho is a must try as the stock soup is well balanced and not too salty or traces of msg. I had the mixed Pho and the brisket and beef slices were tender. The beef balls had peppercorns which made it yummy! We had a side order of deep fried spring rolls and it was tasty, fresh and not too oily. If you have a craving they also serve excellent dishes that will bring the true taste of Vietnanese cuisine to you. BTW the iced Vietnamese coffee packs a punch as well
4
I have not eating much pho in Singapore because it is so much better in Vietnam and Australia. This place finally means I can now eat pho in Singapore. The pho is quite good. Quite authectic, except that you don't get the big plate of bean sprouts and basil because it has been put in for you. The beef was generous.The cha gio fried spring rolls were very nice, but only 2 pieces of lettuce to wrap 6 of them them in???? Blame Singaporeans for not doing it the right way.Prices are decent starting from $7 for pho. The place is not cramped with a decent amount of aisle room. Even then, they did not allow us to add an extra chair as it would narrow the almost 2m aisle.... then told us to wait outside whilst they set up a big round table (which was nearly ready. We walked out, then were told to come back in just as we reached the outside. We weren't blocking or anything... Vietnamese style....Anyway, we enjoyed the food
5
There was the moment when the food was not as good as before. But it clearly is back to its best. Still a large choice in the menu. The service is not great but I just can say this is the same as Vietnam. Still on the best in town
4
Love their chicken pho, the broth is soooo rich with flavour. Second choice will be pork chop rice, dip it into some fish sauce, so yummy!! They do have rice rolls which are good, but personally, I'm not a fan. As of beverages, Vietnamese coffee and soda with lemon juice.
4
One of the more famous Viet eatery along the Joo Chiat stretch. Beef pho is quite good and the stock is rich & yummy. Worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood or if you are craving for a bowl of pho.
4
Best in Singapore. Very affordable and must visit if you desired Vietnamese cuisine. Only pay cash. No credit. Must queue especially weekend dinner.
4
Authentic Vietnamese Food at affordable Price .Serve with Local beer or Cold Vietnamese Tea .Price is very reasonable serve fresh & Hot.Must try even if you are not Vietnamese.
4
Love this place, I keep coming back for more. No frills, genuine Vietnamese joint that won't hurt your wallet either.
4
One of the better Vietnamese cuisine in town. According to a Vietnamese friend, they serve more "southern" Vietnamese. Their Pho is excellent and makes you crave for more...
3
Crowded; noisy and filled with happy diners. Green mango salad with shrimp and peanuts is delicious. Spring rolls, too. Ambience nil. Soups, chicken and/or beef soups bland but tasty. An interesting experience.
5
The food is yummy here
The place is really basic but it feels authentic
It's cheap and good
I recommend the dry noodles with pork and spring roll and the pho bo
3
I came from my HCMC with a terrible longing for Vietnamese food and found myself in a queue in front of this restaurant. Not to totally discredit this place that it doesn't serve good food but I just felt that it didn't really taste like what I've tasted in HCMC and that the neighbors around this restaurant offers similar fare at cheaper prices.
4
Back to soak in the ambience of a typical VN restaurant. Cramp, noisy, average service but good food and better prices!!This time we had Pho with raw slices of beef, fish stewed with pork belly and fish sauce, the fish sauced marinated fried chicken wings and the rice paper rolls. All were great and as expected. However this time around the Pho was a disappointment because it came cold and the beef was tough.Together with 2 drinks, it cost us $40 and more than sufficient for 3 of us. Great value but prepare to queue for 30 minutes
4
First be prepared to queue for your food ! it's always crowded ! Eating here is always an interesting experience, you can find around you, homesick Vietnamese, local families,courting couples and hungry hookers from neighborhood bars. All crowding and congregating for authentic Vietnamese food.The food here is quite authentic, I enjoyed the various versions of Pho noodles here it always tastes good when accompanied by a healthy dose of mint and basil leaves, it goes well with chicken wings, Vietnamese spring rolls and a good dose of beer.Service levels here are a bit rudimentary largely due to the overworked staff coping with incessant crowds
4
I love this place, I keep going back for cheap and cheerful noodles. The selection beyond noodles is solid, but its just the pho that keeps comeing back. Broth is great, brisket excellent.
4
great food. have not had food like since the early 70's. I will go back to this place again on my next trip. had good service and food was cooked fast.
4
Best Vietnamese food I've had outside Vietnam, in an interesting part of town (read slightly red light).
Not bad on the budget either!
Go early to avoid the queues.
4
So first off, let's start with the food. We had a simple dinner of spring rolls (both fresh and fried), a seafood noodle pho and a classic beef pho. The rolls were delicious, although the fresh one was a tad too bland for my liking. There wasn't enough kick from the herbs, but overall, it was alright. The beef pho was a cosy bowl of goodness. They were very generous with the portions, and the beef had a nice sweetness to it. I would have ordered a second bowl had I not been stuffed with spring rolls. The seafood pho was delicious as well - flavours were well-balanced.The service is...well, you don't expect much service. The waitress was in a foul mood so she was throwing menus at every table, and chucking plates off her huge tray as she rushes from one dinner group to the next while screaming at the kitchen. The queue time wasn't so bad. I had 2 big groups ahead of me so I had to wait for about 30 minutes.For our meal with a beer and a glass of lime juice (do not order that, it's too sweet and tart), we paid $40. Just take note that they don't take cards and it's cash only
5
We staying on joo Chiat road and looked this place up on the Internet. It's small and pretty casual, but the food was fantastic. The nicest pho we've had since Saigon. The beef noodles were lovely too. If you're in the area make a stop off here. You won't regret it.
1
After queuing to get a table, we still had to wait more than 10 mins to get the attention of the service staff to take our order. After that, we waited nearly 30 mins more and still no food! Patrons who came after us were all being served their orders! Enquired about our order but was told "it's coming"! It's a standard reply as the service staff did not even check on our order! I approached the cashier counter and was told there was no order taken for our table!! After checking they discovered that the order taker had misplaced our order!After all that and a feeble apology, they never offered to comp our meal nor a discount! We will never go back there again. The food is not that great and the service is horrendous to say the least! Service staff looks unhappy and serve with a grumpy attitude

This is the 3rd time that I am back and each time the outlet seems to add on more dishes. The pho is the signature dish that you must try. The place offers a simple yet homely ambience suitable for family too. It is getting more crowded, evident of its good food served. There will be a short queue waiting to be served but I didn't wait any longer than 7 min. Look at my photos posted, and you don't need to travel often to Vietnam for some real good Vietnamese food anymor

Apart from the price, I think this place is over-rated. Ambience of the place is like a setting at the coffee shop, very noisy and crowded-I honestly feel the wait is not worth it. Had the chicken pho which was average, I don't think it's to die for but perhaps for $7, you can't complain. Had the fresh rolls and the fried rolls $7-4 pcs, I must say the fresh rolls were good-very authentic. Didn't really like the fried ones as you could taste the rancid oil; perhaps they don't change the oil that frequently. $7 for 4 pcs - probably reasonable. I wouldn't go back again if I had to queue to eat there-I would really say food is JUST average. A lot of Vietnamese locals come here too

The pho at Long Phung is worth the hype but the service can be rude and intimidating. Also the queues can be pretty bad. If you are in the area and it's not peak eating time I'd recommend popping in for a quick bowl of hot soup but that's about it.

Visited on a Saturday, expected to have long queues & packed restaurant at 7pm & true enough it was packed to capacity but we only 3rd in line. Took us 25 mins wait despite just 3rd in line. I was starving & my gastric pangs began to churn inside. The moment we were given our table, instantaneously i ordered the fried popiah & quails & requested to come first & quickly, whereas the other dishes like beefball Pho, spicy Pho, garlic cockles, avocado smoothie & strawberry smoothie could come later. True enough, my request was fulfilled as instructed. Popiah was good as always, & perfectly matched the vinagrette with an explosion of tastes. Quails were a little disappointing bcos they were not crispy at all which used to be served that way & also not piping hot. Hence, we couldnt enjoy the aroma as in the past. The broth for the Beefball Pho was too salty. Beefballs were just ok not a wow as they were not bouncy 'boing-boing' at all, possibly too much lean meat. Spicy Pho was good & worth a try. Actually, it's not very spicy, ranking 2/5. Cockles cooked wt garlic was excellent, should give a try if you do consume cockles. However, we dipped into the vinagrette instead of the black salt that they served with & found the taste more complementing. Both the smoothies were good & alot for one pax. At first, we wanted their famous & popular Coconut Smoothie but was out of stock due to overwhelming diners. I highly recommend their Coconut Smoothie despite paying 40% more. After a sumptuous dinner, we strolled along the shoplots looking for other Vietnamese Restaurants around. To our shock, all the others were empty yet Long Phung was crowded to the brim with incoming customers still queueing outside as long as 15 to 20 pax. This speaks for itself & that you wont be wrong dining here. Come during weekdays, you might not even have to queue at all, just march in like a king or queen

Big lunch crowd. Go early. But not a long wait if you can't. The food is good. The staff is friendly.

Food here is authentic and delicious. Vietnamese coffee, taken hot or iced, has the intensity and nutty flavor that only Vietnamese coffee can give. Long queue but it moves fast.

This is the best authentic Vietnamese restaurant that i have ever tasted among all that i have tried. Most of the items ate made and done very tasty & delicious. The vietnamese roll both fried and non fried is one of the must have items, the pho soup is superb. Papaya salad, bbq quail chicken, deep fried chick wings, pork chop are signature items.Ice coffee is also strong and nice!This is the place that i would return again and again for good vietnamese food.

If you don't mind the hawker centre-style environment and waiting in line for up to 30 minutes, this place serves some of the best and certainly the most authentic Vietnamese dishes in Singapore. It attracts a very varied clientèle from all walks of life - different ethnies, professionals from the CBD types to the KTV types, some coming from far away areas and some from the neighbourhood. Avoid the noodle soups (like phở - better elsewhere). The more adventurous can try deep-fried chicken feet, chili stir-fried zuzu snails (ốc len) - so flavourful. Friendly staff, efficient service. Excellent value

We had 1 dry pho with pork, we enjoyed it a lot. The pho rare beef and fried quil are very good. The broth is delicious. Stir fried zuzu in coconut also worth trying. It taste a bit sweet, i personally think they are good but my friend does not enjoy it. Zuzu is some kind of snail which you have to suck them in order to get the meat out. This small restsurant Is located a bit far from down town but there are a lot of local food around the area. Standart trafitional restaurant, very casual place. Not properly decorated. Many students and locals. We paid SGD 54 for 3 pho. Quil. Zuzu and vietnamese spring roll and 4 drinks. The service is oke.

As my title mentions, this is truly the only Vietnamese restaurant my wife and I dine in. It is situated in the joo chiat district and there's a large car park just behind the restaurant. Food is awesome! Service is fast. Flavors are authentic. Prices are very reasonable. My recommendations are their Vietnamese rice rolls, their beef noodle soup. Those interested in shellfish can try their cockles in tamarind sauce. Looking forward to my next visit!

I have tried the food there a few times is good but not that fantastic.The place is small and cramp. Most of the time crowded & staff there seems not happy I guess it could be few reasons probably over work or not good working environment. They seem eager for us to leave asap

Visited on 3rd May for our 5th time within 50 days, it just shows how much we like patronising this place - must be good food, reasonably priced, good service, good premise & good car parking. This round, the restaurant was overcrowded with queue as long as 15 pax. People of all races & nationailities (local Singaporeans including Malays, Indian Nationals, Chinese Nationals. Vietnamese, Nepalis, Sri Lankans, Filipinos, Australians, New Zealanders, Britons, Americans, Canadians, Indonesians, Thais, Malaysians, Germans, French, etc), queued up patiently but enthusiastically. We knew its going to be a long queue & crowded becos it's a Sunday & also it's during peak hour at 6pm. What amazed us was the queue moved fast & diners were not agigated not displayed any frustrations. While queueing, we made new friends from a lovely family of 3 who were Chinese Nationals from Suchou. We were so delighted that the daughter recommemded us few dishes which we had not tried before. Upon getting our table, despite the place was packed to capacity, our food were served appropriately & timely. We did try the new dishes & smoothies, & they were great!! Got to try the smoothies esp coconut & jack fruit. The sour vege soup is another must, boy it was addictive. Overall was another satisfying dining experience. We were so blessed to have the same waitress Ah Ping serving us from start to end. She deserves our mentioning of her bcos she's cheerful, always wt a genuine smile, pleasant voice & order taking, resourceful to recommend us what's suiting to our taste & needs, yet prompt & efficient. We observed other waitresses were not as pleasant as Ah Ping bcos they sulked, displayed sour & long faces, crude with their responds, impatient & not welcoming. As my usual habit, i would approach the cashier counter to cheer the staff that their food were delicious & thanked them

Brought my mum & wife to dine dinner at 6pm. So lucky to get the same car park lot directly opposite the restaurant despite heavy traffic. Was also lucky that we got a table for 3 instantly but we saw 15 people qeueing outside & every table was occupied. It can contain 60 pax at one go with 15 tables. The same waitress who attended to me in my last visit took our orders & she could still remember me despite thousands of faces to recollect since my last visit. Awesome! She was polite & prompt & kindly recommended us few new dishes like the quail, kangkong, pork chop rice & tamarind drink besides my favorite beef Pho & Deep fried mini popiah. Despite the full house crowd & peak hour, the dishes came promptly one after another. Kudos to the chef & waitresses. Everything was good, delicious & a good portion. While we were eating, i could see the queue moving but quickly filled up with 15 pax queueing again. My advice to those coming on weekends to be prepared with long queue but it does move. Before leaving, i approached the lady waitress & female owner at the cashier counter just to thank them for great food & good service & to keep up their good works

While the prices at Long Phung were reasonable when we had dinner there, the food was just ok. The suburb of Joo Chiat is worth exploring but I don't think we will be returning to Long Phung next time we visit. There are better Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore

I'd say that expensive, and just a small bowl of dried noodles costs me $8.50 😡. Coconut smoothie is abt $6.50. It's just a bit higher than the hawker stall but double price 😤. I'd never back for that kinda 'restaurant' 😏.
5
The last review pretty much said it all so all I can do I say "I love this place!" Perfect when you need a Vietnamese fix.
4
Defniitely the best Vietnamese food found here. Their beef pho is excellent, soup is tasty and beef is tender. Do try the spring rolls and fried quail too. Only problem is that this place is perpetually crowded and noisy.
4
After a long queue, finally got to taste the cooking here. Great value for money, buzzing & late closing time - perfect for late night snacks!

I was here at 4:30pm, alone, & public car parking was just juxtaposing this premise (very convenient). However, for drivers who are unfamiliar with Joo Chiat Road, be careful with this one way street especially if you drove in from Dunman Rd. The restaurant is pretty spacious with more than 15 tables, can accommodate 80 pax. Service was prompt & the waitresses can speak Mandarin & simple English, adequate enough for ordering food. They are polite, gentle & helpful. Since i came alone, i could'nt eat too much despite most of the dishes looked so yummy in the Menu. There are more than 60 dishes & 30 beverages, spoilt with choice. So I ordered only my all-time favorite Beef Pho, fried Popiah & Avogado Smoothie. Popiah came within 5 mins & followed with Pho & Smoothie, pretty quick. Perhaps, at this hour, I was still early & the place had only 8 pax only so efficiency is expected. The portion was just right, not too little & not too excessive unlike those huge bowls served in Melbourne. Price was just right for every dish. The smoothie was fantastic, taste, quality & quantity. The popiah was excellent especially the skin & the fillings too. Got to dip into the special chilli-fish sauce. I would definitely return for my next meal here very soon & will definitely introduce more people to join me especially my family members, relatives, circle of friends, neighbors & church members. It's a homely feeling & a family-business. Most diners were Vietnamese & that's a good testament to the authenticity & affordable pricing of the food. I highly recommend you to come.

The food is nice and cheap! We chose Pho bo and Bun Manh Vit (duck and baboo noddle)! The fried spring roll is good but not the fresh one! The service is pretty slow! I have to wait nearly 15 mins plus experienced long queue!I don't think they have high hygiene for food! I don't dare to go toilet there!

Just had lunch at this unpretentious restaurant today withtwo overseas friends.The restaurant is not crowded during lunch unlike during the evenings.On entry, we noticed that there were two thirds locals and one third Vietnamesediners. This boded well.We had two orders of pho and two orders of vermecelli with pork cutlet &fried spring rolls.Inaddition we shared an order of fresh spring rolls, an order of fried springrolls plus a large plate of papaya salad. Both types of spring rolls were fine.The pho was flavoursome but slightly sweetish & I note, lack a robust beef flavourplus there was lack of fresh herbs that are the usually comes with this dish.I could not detect the star anise, cinammon etc coming through in the broth too.The vermecelli with pork cutlet & fried spring rolls was a good & hearty meal. A sauce comes with this dish.The pork cutlet was well-done and cut into strips. Again nil herbs came with this dish.The large portion of papaya salad was a disappointment, even with the sliced prawns andsmall strips of pork belly.....not piquant and vinegarish enough.We had iced coffee,tea, two fresh coconuts tarmarind drink and at the end of themeal, two hot Vietnamese coffee. The hot coffee was nice and strong with a vanillaafter taste.There is a fairly wide menu.The total bill came to around SGD 85 for the four of us.The papaya saladwas not worth the SGD 15

For lunch, we had Vietnamese food including the popular Vietnamese paper spring rolls, beef noodles and seafood fried noodles. There were several Vietnamese restaurants in the area, but Long Phuong is the most popular judging from the queue outside the place at 2pm. The queue moved quickly and we managed to get seats soon after. The spring rolls with rice noodes, basil leaves, prawn and pork were delicious, and they went out with the sauce. The spring rolls were made from rice paper which was quite strong because even though they stuck to each other, we managed to separate them without the skin breaking. The seafood noodles were delicious, with plenty of seafood like squid and prawns. As for the spicy beef noodles, the meat was tender which went well with the rice noodles and tasty gravy. The drinks at the restaurant were kind of expensive, they cost around $3 and above which is like half the costs of a main course. The main dishes were priced between $6-$10, which is quite reasonable and there is no GST nor service charge. It was a better option than Nam Nam which is slightly more expensive but the location of Long Phuong might be out of the way for those who do not stay in the eastern area

The first time I followed an on-line suggestion to try this place for the best Pho in Singapore. I was so happy I came back for more. During my 7 weeks in Singapore my friends and I visited Long Phung on 7 occasions. I love their special Pho, so much so I'm still dreaming of it. The Papaya salad is gorgeous too and they server large bottles of Tiger at a very reasonable price.Is very popular so expect to queue for a while. It's well worth it. It's in an interesting area, with other "attractions" and a large number of both restaurants and bars

Friend brought me here to try Vietnamese food. Quite amazed by the setup, the waitress serving are all Vietnamese and they speak Chinese too! I think I pissed the waitress off by my request of removing the bean sprouts out from my beef noodles which taste good!! We ordered the spring rolls too! It contained pork so halal ppl, you have been warned! And lastly my friend mention I HAVE TO ORDER THE ICE COFFEE!! Its amazing!!

This simple set-up give great Vietnamese coffee that is worth the wait of your stolen precious time.

I went to this restaurant with colleague and guest.Despite week day night, queue was never ending,very busy.There were enough attentive staffs.So, it was no problem to order.But their attitude was pretty unfriedly.Taste,volume, price of foods were good!We enjoyed spring rolls,phos,salad,zuzu, and tiger beer!

Was seriously impressed with this place!! Perfect food best rice I have ever tasted what a find. Easy to order with the picture menu so no language barrier will be back before holiday finishes !

Busy place, tasty food. Long queues after 7:30. We had spring rolls, papaya salad, sweet/sour chicken and pho. Loved it.

I am Vietnamese, my husband is English, we like food and wouldn't say we were super fussy. We've recently moved to Singapore and stopped here one day when walking past, precisely because it was busy and full of Vietnamese customers which made us think it must be a decent place. However found that Long Phung is ok, not best Vietnamese food we've had so not sure why it's got such good reviews. This is what we thought:1. Service - unfriendly, no smiling in this place! You might get the odd staff who is slightly nicer. Don't expect good 'customer service'.2. Not the cleanest place but on par with other similar places.3. I had 'mien', daughter had 'pho' of which I helped her with, my husband had 'bun cha' and son had sea food fried rice. The pho was salty and stock was mediocre. What really makes any Vietnamese soup noodle is the quality of the stock/soup. I'm not sure if it was real stock or just a lot flavouring e.g salt, msg, sugar. My husband's dish was a bit bland and meat was a bit dry, again taste is ok. The fried rice was very oily and tastes of something, just wouldn't say it was 'tasty'. Finally my mien, again was mediocre. We've been twice, would go again if we craved Vietnamese food and the other restaurants are worse (we're going to try them), but certainly nothing to shout about. Long Phung does authentic dishes, it's just that the quality of those dishes are not fantastic
3
The beef soup noddles are tasty but I think it contained quite a fair bit of MSG in it as I do feel thirsty after eating. The steam spring rolls are quite bland. The queue was quite long on saturday evening which I don't think is worth the time waiting in line
3
A popular Vietnamese joint in Joo Chiat. Possibly the only Vietnamese cafe in the whole stretch with a queue. Not sure what the draw is. Tried the food and I can only say its average. The beef pho has MSG and the meat was tougher than what I am used to. The fresh spring roll was chewy as the skin was too thick. The spring rolls were probably made in advance. Fried chicken wings was average. Overall a relatively cheap place to dine in as a bowl of pho is around $6.50-7.50. They do serve seafood dishes such as cockles, gong gong, etc
5
Vietnamese food done really really well being eaten by Vietnamese and served and cooked by Vietnamese. Not a swanky place at all, there is always a queue but its worth it. Joo Chiat is a really interesting area and this place makes it all the more so. The squid, pho, lightly cooked beef in lemon and the papaya salad are genuinely phenomenal
3
Want to give them a better score than average but just can't....It's kind a hole in the wall joint. The waitresses all shout at each other. Food is OK. I'm not into MSG, and all the dishes we ordered has MSG and is bit sweeter than Vietnamese food should be. I guess I have to make a trip to Vietnam again to get the real deal. Place is small and was packed, and there seem to be a small crowd waiting throughout the time we were there for early lunch on Sunday. The family table next to us, the young boy had his video game volume turned up 100% to compete with the noise in the room. Place is located on a street that is lined with KTV bars that are closed during the day. The best plate ordered was the lime/beef. This dish portion was big and the meat was of decent quality. The broths to all the soup could use improvement. I guess it's worth checking out and get your own taste opinion on it. CASH ONLY place

Simply went walking to find a restaurant and I'm a believer that if a place is busy (especially with locals) the chances are it is good - well this place fits that description. Busy, lots of activity and quick service usually with a smile. Menu is extensive and having been to Vietnam on several occasions, authentic. Food is quickly served and is tasty and plentiful ( Asian serves). Have no complaints except, with a place as busy as this you can expect cleanliness to be, well wanting at times. Beers are cold and served in iced glasses. Serviettes would be a good idea management. Condiments are plentiful.Great, won't say cheap, place.Be prepared to wait or share a table with fellow diners.Cash only
