The Sandwich Shop is a Singapore institution. You always know what you are going to get. The sandwiches are fresh and hearty.
Their coffee is a great and welcome surprise.

Consumed two shrimp sandwiches that were extremely tasty. The good part is that although the sandwiches are cold, the restaurants warms it up and serves you the same. Good add on's like coconut water and desserts are also available.

Earlier I had posted a review on a sandwich place in the same locality, now I believe God has his unique way of balancing things. This place is just too good if your are looking at a light yet filling meal. The sandwiches are fresh. You will be spoilt for choices. A very healthy experience and certainly a must go. It has a sitting area too. Not only sandwiches but you've got salads and many other things to choose from.so when in cbd go for it

The lines here can get surprisingly long though (but it moves fairly quickly), so it's best to come early. If you visit closer to 2pm the lines will also be shorter, but the selection will often be more limited. After you've been here 10 times or more then you certainly start to get sick of what is on offer
