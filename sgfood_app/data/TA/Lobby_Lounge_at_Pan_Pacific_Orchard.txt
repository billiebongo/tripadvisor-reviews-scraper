Do not come here.... food typically takes an hour to arrive from the time you place your order. I will definitely not return. It seems the staff are trained to handle complaints instead of customer orders.

Comfortable place to meet a friend or while away an afternoon drinking tea and reading the paper. Efficient service
4
Exceptional Service. I thought the food was average. However, with the entertainer 1-for-1, I thought it was worth the value

Pan Pac provided guests with a good varieties of food for breakfast! Food are fresh, soap noodle is super and delicious! And don't forget to get a cup of hot latte from the coffee bar! Yr good day starts from here

Had hi-tea with my sisters and niece today and we had a great time for various reasons. 1) Food was great, especially the savory bites which is refillable. The prawn twister and rosti were so yummy we ordered three servings each! 2) Nice cozy ambience which is great for gatherings with friends & family3) Unlimited order for coffee and twg tea 4) Best of all, complimentary parking! We couldn’t ask for more and were especially impressed with the professionalism of Nusnul. Would have give 5⭐️ if service (by other staff) is a little faster tho... Overall great value for money hi-tea which we would strongly recommend.
5
Nice ambiance, great service, constant attention from staff who checks in on us if we needed anything. Thank you staff Nusnul and duty Manager (sorry didn't get your name) for your wonderful and attentive service throughout our meal.

Ambiance is nice and less crowded. Location is about 10mins walk from Orchard mrt and behind the Royal Thai Embassy. Staff were attentive and made us felt welcome though we think that the drinks serving time could be improved. Selection of pastries and cakes were quite good and tasty. There were also four types of “savory” dishes like chicken skewers, prawns, sausages, etc which are also part of the high tea. Usual price is SGD32++ but we paid SGD17+ per pax with the entertainer app.

Went with friends for Hi Tea.Free flow of pastries for our 3tier Hi Tea set. Price reasonable for acceptable cakes, scones, sandwiches etc. The drinks includes TWG tea selections and coffee. And additions, free flow of satay, roast chicken, sausage set.location is behind Thai embassy, alittle on a down side.Staffs was good but serving is way to slow. Was very thirsty, ordered our beverage immediately we sat down, but drinks came super late. even the hi tea sets came, the drink was not.I have reminded the staffs twice but it came after then.Not visiting it again.
4
Friendly staff, excellent breakfast, wide variety . Lobby Lounge staff always at hand to cater for any needs
5
Very relaxing very clean able to have quite drink or meal. A good meeting place or sit there waiting to go to airport for a sad trip home

We enjoyed our high tea at the Lobby Lounge! The food was fantastic & the ambience was wonderful and cosy. Arjun the staff and his team were friendly and delivered good service. Thank you! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐

I used the Entertainer App 1 for 1 and paid about $19 per pax for the Afternoon Tea. The usual price is $32++. The service was warm and friendly. They seemed happy to serve us. Thumb up ! As there were only two staffs on duty, it did take some effort to get their attention. The setting is in beige and light wood. The orange light gave a very comfortable cozy and understated classy feel. There are couch or table seating to choose from. The place is quiet, a wonderful place to catch up with friends. I think the Afternoon Tea is available from 2pm to 5pm on Mon - Fri. I am unsure about weekends. The three-tier stand has scones, cakes and sandwiches. The fruit scones were not nice. It was rather hard and stale. It did not taste its best. I had better scones at Tangs Marriott Hotel Lobby Lounge. Some of the cakes were nice. I like the carrot cake and sandwiches. I find three out of the four savoury choices delicious - the chicken satay with peanut sauce and sliced cucumber, the grilled prawns and banger (sausage) and mash with mustard sauce. The prawns were a good size and very well cooked. The banger and mash was the highlight. When I sank my teeth into the banger, there was a 'crispy' level of skin and came the tasty and delicious . There was an expensive taste to it. They gave us two lists of Coffee and Tea to choose from. They were the TWG Tea which was a delight to me. My friend had three types of beverages. Without further question, they just served the change of beverages generously. This aspect was very impressive ! I will certainly go back there again for Afternoon Tea. My friends enjoyed the Afternoon Tea. We were glad that we went there for our meet up.

The food are not bad. And it was really a seafood buffet as it has lobsters, oysters and other seafood, be it cold or hot. The price was cheap for me as I was using 1 for 1 @ $98++. But there are some downsides, some of which are the same as my visit in 2015: 1) The staff are quite inattentive. For the staff that came over to collect our plates, they would just collect it, regardless whether was it an empty plate or not. They did not ask whether do we want it to be collected. 2) Seafood buffet - I understand the management wanna do crowd control for the Oyster Bar and the Sashimi Counter, which I am totally fine with it. But, except for the first 2 hours of the buffet time, the remaining of the time, we have to look for the kitchen crew high and low just to open 5 oysters (Their rule is per customer can only take 5 oysters at a time) or a plate of Sashimi. There was once I was standing in front of the oyster bar and Sashimi counter, with nobody attending to me. Sad. I think the management may wanna relook at their staff training (kitchen and servers) for the cafe. It seems like they did not improve their service after all these while
5
My office is nearby and this is one of our top choice for chilling out after work. Great service is always ensured by Arjun and the rest of the waitresses like Pauline etc. Nice environment
5
I had lunch with my boyfriend at this Pan Pacific's restaurant. This was the best buffet I had ever tried: there were basically all the types of asian food (and some european) masterfully served.We had fresh shellfish and salmon, sushi, noodles, indian food, pizza, meat and a huge dessert buffet including ice cream, cheesecake, crumble, brownies, waffles, cookies etc etc.The price was 60 SGD per person
4
Nice place to sit and have a drink or snack. Service is good. You can order a meal here although most people use the buffet
5
I habe been travelling for business for 18 years but the service received in the lobby lounge by Mr Arjun Sharma has been one of a kind. Not only remembered he me after more than 2 months having been there. No he also remembered my favourite wine! In my subsequent visits he maintained the high costumer experienced and I can highly appreciate this bar and the experience Mr Sharma can give you. He makes you feel home away from home on these sometimes lonely business travels! Definitely highly recommended
5
Arjun Sharma and his staff do an outstanding job helping me feel welcome and relaxed after a long work day
3
Unfortunately we arrived at around 8.30pm and we found the food to be very dry. Most of the food sits in bay maree's with lights keeping it warm, that's it warm not hot and it also dries the food out. The chef cooked fresh steak which was fine, the lobster was yuck as were the prawns and the satay chicken very dry, they try hard but the chefs should check the quality of the food more often. The cost was $68 per head which was a little high for the quality
5
This is a nice lobby at a 5-star hotel. Good service at the bar. Lots of space to spread out and just chill. The door men were fabulous
3
Whilst waiting for our room to be ready , we decided to have a coffee . $28 later. Far too expensive
4
Well-balanced of sweet and salty items which was not usually seen in an afternoon tea menu. Free-flow of food and drinks. You would be satisfied. Lovely service from the staff! Would recommend
5
One good thing to notice about hotels is how they put extra effort into making their lobbies extra beautiful and sweet smelling.Pan Pacific Orchard's lobby is simple, but always clean and smells nice.
2
Considering the quality of everything else in this hotel, this lounge/bar/dining area was a disappointment. It took 20 mins to place an order. The bar snacks when they turned up were stale, then we waited another 20 minutes to find someone to request the check.The setting is very pretty but i was not impressed with anything else. I wouldn't rush back here
4
Bar staff very helpful and good menu for drinks. Usually not very busy so one can easily find a seat even if there are a group of you. Prices about average for Singapor
4
Not a great deal to say. Just the place for a light snack and a drink (it was Happy Hour, so I didn't have to pay for Mrs Grunt's drink!). Efficient service and tasty snacks. We were staying in the hotel, so didn't have far to roam. Their chilled Sauvignon Blanc was perfectly served
4
This is s case of doing what it says on the tin.The staff are good and food good as well, what more to say?The lounge provides a great environment to relax eat and drink out of the hustle and bustle of both the hotel and Singapore
5
After walking around Orchard Road, it was very nice to sit down here at relax with a drink while the kids ran upstairs. Very comfortable
4
The Lounge dominates the space on the right side of the lobby as you enter the hotel. It is quite chic and slightly elevated. I met some friends who lived in Singapore at the Lobby Lounge as I was staying at the hotel.There is an extensive choice of wines, beers, cocktails, whiskey's & juices to suit every taste. The staff is very attentive & the peanuts are free. There is also a varied snack/finger food menu should you e so inclined. We took advantage of the Happy hour two for one offer before heading out for dinner. A very pleasant experience & a nice way to start a Friday evening in Lion City
4
This is a great place to have a drink or a light meal. Awesome drinks menu there is not much they do not serve. Great before or after your dinner or lunch. A great place to meet friends or have a meeting. Enjo
4
There's just enough food choices for everyone. However I cant point out any menu that really stood out..
5
The Ambience of this place is fantastic. Arjun and Huisien are the stars of this place, look for them for a 5 star service.
5
I visit the PP lounge every week to enjoy some drinks with friends after a hectic day at work. The service level never fails to amaze me, making us feel at home and experience is always positive. Kudos to Manager Ajun and team (Pauline eg) for maintaining a high level of service. And truth be told, the pricing on drinks is also very decent during happy hours!
5
The food is awesome and the service is excellent , if you guys planning for a dinner , i suggest here's one of the place should be visit 
5
The service team was excellent greeted by Boon and Danabal. Feel so welcome. The hotel is lucky to have an excellent staff like them. Kudos to the service staff. Restaurant food was excellent and wide range of variet
4
We enjoyed the bar for two nights, good snacks and great cocktails, nice staff, definitely reccomende
4
The bar and food options here are a great alternative to joining the crowd at the main dinning area
5
We ate most of our dinners at the lobby lounge. Was the perfect place to go to after a day out and sit back and relax with some food and some drinks.The food and the staff were perfect
4
Good to meet people for business or pleasure. Comfortable, with the possibilities to use also external table (open air). For me the perfect dimension, not to big, usually quite , good natural lighting during the day time. If they improve just little the menu offer for alternative finger food, it will be perfect
5
Professional yet friendly service for business traveller. Kavitha who served me was delightful, courteous & polite. Thankfully she recommended the "Pleasure Plate" of tenderloin steak and lamb chop.Paul the breakfast chef is always happy and cooks lovely ommeletes and other egg dishes
5
Take a break and come to rest in this relaxing environment. Excellent service, and more important very considerate and friendly. Reading chairs available or tables to work at. Whilst located in the lobby, still a very calm and quiet surrounding.
5
Great selection great value! Tasty! Highly recommend. Local food options as well as international delicacies
4
Food selection was very good for a lobby lounge, service was slow on one one occasion with food being delivered separately for our two diners which is not what you want when eating as a couple.
5
The evening Manager Arjun has a very welcoming nature. He has a professional approach to his work and knows what the Business Traveller needs. A great visit.
5
Good facilities, including check-in Counter.
Food and beverages very good
Service perfect, Mrs Sheryll Soh to be highlighted as premium butler
5
I wasn't thrilled when I called for reservations at the restaurant and was offered a table in the Lobby Lounge. It ended up being the perfect place for a quiet, comfortable dinner -- preferable to sitting in the restaurant, in my opinion. Arjun Sharma, the restaurant exec, was attentive and helpful, with excellent recommendations for food and wine pairings. Everything he brought us was delicious. The buffet was terrific, too, but the lounge atmosphere and the personal attention made our dining experience memorable
5
I frequent the lobby lounge bar almost every other week. This place offers other than cosiness , great wines also couples with warm services especially coming from Mr Arjun & his regular all-female team. They make you feel homely & at ease most of the time. I will definitely rate it beyond excellence.BusinessmanWO
5
We met two friends here one early evening while my two small kids had dinner here. The food quality was good, the staff were helpful with high chairs for my kids and generally friendly to us. The lounge itself is, like the hotel, attractively designed. A pleasurable place to hang out (until the kids got squirmy and we had to rush them upstairs for bedtime!)
4
Came with my friend on a weekday night last month and we love it! The place is quiet and cosy. the staff were attentive and efficient. Special mention to Arjun who is very approachable and able to recommend something that suit us to drink. Overall, a great experience and a great place to catch up with friends
5
The lobby lounge at Pan Pacific Orchard is an ideal place to spend some time in the evening. You can treat yourself to the variety of alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. The best part is that its quiet and nice place with good service by the attentive staff. Its a No Smoking lounge but smoking area is available just outside the lounge
5
The lobby lounge is very comfortable to spend some time enjoying the coffee with the prepared snacks
5
Food are fresh and delicious, the service are friendly and good, we have a present night over there.
4
The staff were friendly and helpful. The food was good quality and tasty. Very convenient if you cant go far.
5
Cozy place with cozy seatings. Went for the Hi-tea and everything was good. Good food and good service. Thank you Dally and Amanda for singing the birthday song. Thank you Hui Sien for the wonderful attention that you gave to us!
3
The drinks are not bad, the pricing also alright. But it is very hard to get the attention of the service crew. I do not think they are understaffed. I think is not attentive enough.
5
I went to Lobby Lounge at Pan Pacific Orchard with a close friend to try their Hi-Tea Buffet for the first time. The service there was excellent. The staff and managers on duty were prompt in clearing the dirty plates and ensuring that our tea cups are filled constantly. The food available were of exceptional quality and worthwhile going back again. I especially love the Penang Fried Kway Teow, Prawn noodles and the Charcoal Scones with kaya. I would like to thank the staff and managers for making the buffet a memorable one. I will most definitely come back soon. Do check out the Hi-Tea Buffet at Lobby Lounge, Pan Pacific Orchar
5
Atmosphere is very relaxed, clean, cozy. Only ruined by a group of Chinese Tourists with no sense of decorum or concept of volume but that was short-lived and can be met anywhere in the world. Staff are very friendly and whilst it's not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, you know what to expect before you sit down based on the name above the door. Sometimes in life... you get what you pay for
4
It was my first time at the Pan Pacific Lobby Lounge. It is located behind Palais Renaissance and I found this to be the easiet way to get to the lounge. It was quiet when I arrived at 2pm. There was just one other table with diners. There was a central spread with various items like smoked salmon, salads, cheese and biscuits, local snacks like carrot cake, curry puffs and a range of tempting looking cakes. In addition to this, the hi team menu also included a platter of afternoon cakes and you are also given an ala carte selection of Western and local dishes to pick from. The servings are tasting dishes size but this means you can try many more dishes because you can try them all (if you have the appetite for it). Coffee and tea are included in the price - S$38++. I loved the variety of dishes available and every dish on the ala carte menu was delicious. This is a cosy respite from the Orchard Road crowd. I am really pleased I stumbled upon this hidden oasis and will definitely come again. The price, variety and ambience are its selling points
5
excellent, they offer breakfast in the morning with a variety of food on a menue and at a buffet, and in the afternoon tea, and in the evening a very nice choice of various food Western as well as Asian style. Good White and red wines, and they serve an excellent Champagne as well as the very nice Tiger beer
5
It was my second time visited Lobby Lounge at Pan Pacific Orchard. First time was for high tea and this time round i tried their cocktails.Nice ambience and personal touch as always... They always check on the cocktails quality as to ensure it suits individual guest's taste bud.Good job , keep it up
4
Good for business or simply socialising. Lots of space for privacy. Friendly staff. Nicely decorated, too.
4
Very open space with a selection of seating arrangements to suit the number of guests one has. Service is good with snack/finger food selection. Great for a before dinner drink if eating at the restaurant next door.
5
The continental selection was huge, with fresh fruit, pastries, fresh bread, cheese selection, cereals. Good choice of eggs and indian breakfast menu too. Excellent variety of tea/coffee. They also have freshly squeezed sugar cane juice,
other veg/fruit juices, health drinks etc.
4
I loved the atmosphere, the service and how they make you feel once there.
Need a taxi? Done! Need to work, so sit and do it without being disturbed.
5
Beautiful Lobby, excellent lobby staff to assist you with your arrangements for the day or night, excellent taxi assistance
4
Uniquely designed chairs in the lobby lounge. They have live music in the evening. Overall the furniture uniquly desined and is comfortable.
5
Exquisite and attentive service by the team at the Lobby Lounge made our Mother's Day High Tea celebration one to remember. They whisked us to our reserved table the moment we arrived and I couldn't find a single fault with their service. Arjun, one of our servers, was a stand-out. Extremely competent, spoke well and very pleasant. The local char kway teow, laksa and Hokkien prawn mee came in nice small portions allowing you to savor all the wonderful flavors. It also reduced wastage. The whole spread and a-la-carte selections were ample for my wife and two children. I offered a tip when paying and Arjun, instead, took out a card and said it would be best to just write a review of the experience on TripAdvisor. I became a new member of TripAdvisor because of him!! Well done Pan Pacific Orchard for hiring the best service staff I've come across in a while. I'm not talking about just getting your food and drinks...anybody can do that. It's the combination of that plus all the pleasantries and sensibilities that come with serving good food. Excellent experience!
5
Early morning big breakfast - fresh food and freshly made omelets and drop scones. We woke early after flying in from Auckland, after taking a Sunday morning stroll around Orchard Road we decided to go back to hotel and try buffet - $35 each $30 if you book on arrival. ... no good til evenin
5
Had a wonderful birthday hi tea experience. Not my first time here.. Each time the service gets better and better... Today especially so. Excellent service from RYAN LAU and FABIO especially. They.. especially RYAN LAU are very friendly. . Attentive and they made the experience that much better. Service with a smile is an understatement. With service staff like this.. This helps make the hotel that much more special and the experience exceptional.I hope people high up take note of these two guys I have mentioned. Do give them strong recommendation letters please as they are well deserved.
4
Very nice selection - fresh seafood including oysters, crab and sushi were very good. Steaks cooked to order were very good too albeit a tad on the small side but you can always order more. Penang char kway was good and the dessert selection was most satisfying. Staff was courteous and friendly. Jayadarran was an excellent host, he made our evening of fine food even better
5
The continental selection was huge, with fresh fruit, pastries, fresh bread, cheese selection, cereals.
5
Amazing array of food that caters for every taste! Highly recommended if you want to stay close to home but enjoy a classy, exotic meal!
4
The lobby is good. Staff is courteous. Rooms are very well appointed. We requested for an early check-in and a late check-out. We had kids with us and we needed the room desperately. On both occasions the Hotel was very accommodating
2
Staff walking around not interested,people not sure what to do when asked to go and sit while the documents for your stay are prepared
5
I came here for a company lunch and the selection was good. Slightly less vegetarian options but the desserts made up for it.
4
A beautiful stylish decorated Lounge whre one can relax after Shopping or Business Meetings. Don't sit too near the bar where sometimes Music may be disturbing.
5
I was staying at the Pan Pacific and had a chance to run down it their sibling the Pan Pacific Orchid for a business meet , although it did not have the fiance of its elder sibling this place was a good value for money and definitely recommended to for Mid-level to Upper-Mid Level management meeting. Service is uncompromised
3
My family wanted to go to 10 at Claymore for buffet lunch on last Sunday, but as it was mother's day and we did not make any reservations, their restaurant manager referred us to lobby lounge, to have a-la-carte menu instead. My husband and I had mushroom soup, which was rather thick and tasty. My husband had the club sandwich which was rather huge. My mom and I had the Chicken caesar salad. However, their salad seemed to be only average, when compared with the same salad that we had in some other restaurants. Probably it is because that the chicken they served is grilled, while the one we had at other restaurants were shredded. We also had hot lemon tea, which was about average too
4
Large hotel lobbies can by default often become a "train station" with people going in various directions, but never hanging around. I had heard the new lobby lounge or Atrium had moved up a gear and that was very true. From a large lounge with a few people, it has become a great bar scene with DJ playing funky music, guests clearly hanging around enjoying the atmosphere. I enjoyed a glass of wine and a nice little dessert, but the main enjoyment was just watching the space and hearing the cool sounds from the female DJ.......The seating arrangements are stylish, you can get almost lost in the settings, or just sit by the very long bar and admire the sounds. The staff were friendly and menu on offer, good!If you need a relaxing night, with a little bit background sound then pop by and see for yourself.Cheers
5
What a brilliant way to spend NYE!!!! I had no idea what to expect but the NYE buffet at the Pan Pac was brilliant. Great food and wine but what made it was the staff. True entertainment. They cranked up the music, got in some professional dancers that choreographed a few songs and got the whole place rocking. It went from a great evening with friends to a very memorable party.I would go again next year.One thing to note - we booked a table downstairs in the Atrium for NYE. They screwed up and gave it to someone else. They tried to recover on the night and it wasn't a disaster but it shouldn't of happened. Beware. Get to your table earlier
