I hope you can see the picture on the chee cheong fun! It's amazingly presented and tastes fantastic with the mushroom and light sauce. But, that's not the forte, it's the array of desserts like ice kacang, cendol, beancurd gingko, etc.There's also a very tasty steamed yam cake and the list goes on, Apparently, this store has moved to Siglap Centre from somewhere else. But, it's a gem to find
