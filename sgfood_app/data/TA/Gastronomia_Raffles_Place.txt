Our fave coffee place after exploring. Definitely recommend. Lots of yummy treats too
The kids enjoyed watching the fountain which is directly attached to the cafe.
Reminded us of coffee from home.

It is located at 6 Battery Road. The location is good and they served very nice food and drinks! It is a cosy nice place for talks.

Gastronomia is always a safe choice for grabbing good food on the way or for this tight lunch break in the financial center of Singapore. Worth a visit and a return!

Their pasta dishes are decent - I usually have the panna pomodoro with mushrooms. The portion size has increased, which was much needed.
Their chocolate chip scones are delicious!

Thats S $15 with a coffee. Admittedly you can get "baked ham" with this for same price but its NOT baked ham its some sort of lucheon roll made up of scraps of meat pressed into a roll. If insted of "ham" you want mushrooms, you get some sort of mix of 98% onion 2% mushroom. Last time here despite scenery

We ate here when looking for quick gluten free options at Raffles City for my wife who is a coeliac. They had a couple of pre-made lunches in the fridge that looked like they should be gluten free (chicken/salmon and rice). After talking to the staff, my wife ended up having an omelette (without the bread) - we didn't 100% trust the preparation for cross-contamination, but the staff were friendly and my wife didnt get sick. They also had gluten free pasta on the menu, but had a disclaimer saying it was prepared using the same equipment as the normal pasta

So this is in the lobby of the office building and it's not an enclosed restaurant but pleasant enough with a green feature wall and high ceiling. It's canteen style so you order your food at the counter. they have a takeaway for the food so they can just warm up the food you see. Choices are quite basic with sandwiches, pasta and pizza. Food maybe cheaper than your normal Da Paolo restaurant but more expensive than normal takeaway food. Pasta Portion may look small but it's actually adequate. Food is not bad. Main issue is that the tables are very close together so there is no barrier space and also one certainly cannot have a business discussion if you don't want others to hear your conversation. Also quite crowded during weekday lunch
