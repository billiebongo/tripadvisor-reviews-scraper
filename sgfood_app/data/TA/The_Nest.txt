Staff extremely friendly and helpful. The Nest has won some food/restaurant awards and deserves it. We had a lunch before and a dinner after golf and were really happy with the food quality and the service. Reasonably priced for Singapore. Good luck and enjoy!

I was hoping to grab a quick lunch near Changi Business Park without the queue and waiting time. The ambience is wonderful - serene with a touch of class & great view of the golf course.

The nest was a good surprise, golf courses usually serve low range (almost junk) food.
The place is neat, extensive menu, attentive service and good innovative fusion food. Price tag was in line with the overall experience. I will return.

The ambience of this restaurant is amazing - planes flying over the gorgeous golf course! The food is delicious, especially the Rib Eye and the sushi! Had crispy fries here too! The dessert (especially the chocolate lava cake) served is SWEEET! ðŸ˜†

This place serves very nice food! Must try the main dishes: Japanese set with wagyu beef and laksa. Do start off with truffle fries, fried fish skin with salted egg yolk, chicken wing, and satay. End your meal with the mango dessert. View of the golf course is fantastic, whether it's day or night. Location is quite inaccessible and construction is still going on outside. But if you drive, do pay a visit there. Patrons must wear covered shoes if you intend to go there.

A great opportunity to have a private club experience, right on the greens. This casual, chic restaurant serves as a cool "19th Hole" to the Members of Laguna National. But at certain times it is open to the public (lunch hours and weekday evenings). You can overlook the 9th and 18th greens of one of Singapore's most recognised golf clubs while you dine on kway teow or horfun. Alternatively try the amazing Nest Cheeseburger with the custom blend of beef from Australia. All in all a wonderful experience. The interior design of the restaurant is amazing as well with soaring ceilings and customised golf murals

As a foodie I can say this restaurant is not your average golf club diningFrom the Japanese sushi to the satay the food here is very good and reasonably pricedThe service is top notch and best of all is the view of the water and the fairs Highly recommend this place for lunch dinner or a snack after s round

I am never coming back again and my Valentine's dinner 2016 was ruined by this restaurant.Ordered medium rare for my beef steak but well done came. Feedback to the captain but he argued with me that the medium rare depends on the size of the beef. What kind of reasoning was that?The beef came back, nicely cooked to medium raw but my foie gras was cut by half. Lost my appetite beef + foie gras returned to the restaurant untouched. Attached pictures to support my feedback

Came here for lunch today with a colleague. There's quite a lot of construction going on at the moment, but once you get through it all the view out over the golf course is very nice. Good selection of inexpensive local, western and Japanese meals. I chose the laksa which was huge and very tasty. Worth another visit

Had lunch at the Nest with my colleagues and liked the setting overlooking the Laguna Golf Course. The menu has a section of local specialities including the Laksa which I ordered. It was great I terms of portion and flavour. Really yummy! A nice touch is that they give you a paper-wowened apron when you order it. A nice touch indeed! Recommended
