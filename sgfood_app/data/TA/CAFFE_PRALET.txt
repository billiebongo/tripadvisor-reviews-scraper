Cosy place with good pasta and grilled chicken.The menu is quite limited and the mushroom soup can be more fluid. It is too thick and semi solid. Cakes are nice.Vintage, quiet neighborhood.Booked with eatigo and have a 30%, with a main and drink each. It cost us about $2

Ordered the following items 1) char grilled chicken chop with mashed potato and wild mushroom sauce. - this is quite good. I like it. 2) honey lemon3) mushroom soup 4) citron pineapple cake. - the citron taste is quite strong. They have matcha mixed with it too. If you are on the medication warfarin, I think should be okie because the amount used is quite minimal because the main ingredient is not matcha. If you want to be cautious then avoid choosing this cake. This itself is a set. Main + cake slice + drink + soup . About SGD 20 I think. Around there.My friends ordered their mains with cake slice so we tried the pralet cake slice and the mango basil cake too. The outer layer of the mango basil cake is like jelly. The mango taste is quite strong too. Not too sweet. I like it. The pralet cake is kinda their signature cake. It's not bad too. They have a high tea set too that consists of cake slice + drink. I think is about SGD 8.

Came here for lunch: ordered the oven-roasted half-chicken with black pepper, and tri-coloured lime slaw as a side. The chicken came with gravy (which I didn't use because of personal preference). Even without the sauce, I expected the roast chicken to be moist enough; unfortunately it wasn't. Though it was satisfactorily tender, so overall the meal was average. The slaw was a bit too oily.My friend had the strawberry cheesecake mousse for dessert. It was tasty! I liked how they layered the mousse between layers of cake, so it firmed up the texture. You must try it if you visit! They do drink + cake deals as top-ups for the meals as well, so a once-in-awhile splurge on food makes it worth it. Other cake options include cute mooncakes, their signature Pralet chocolate cake, and Gula Melaka macaron cake. Dessert variety is quite aplenty

It's my second visit to this place, and accounting for both my visits, this place serves simple good and honest food that's not trying too hard to be something they're not. Contrary to the "Caffe" in their name, their prices aren't the typical exorbitant cafe prices we Singaporeans have come to loathe. Had the chicken on both my visits, first being the char grill and the second accompanied with a satay sauce that happened to be their special for the month. Although the food was not spectacular, not something I'd write home about but they were q generous with their portions and I really appreciate the service I get here. overall very simple and satisfying. would I travel all the way from the west just to eat here? maybe not but I wouldn't mind making a slight detour if I were around the area.

- Environment is nice- no GST and service charge- Food portion generous- Reasonable PricesOrdered fish & chips with fries. The homemade coleslaw is included as a side. The coleslaw is beetroot coleslaw. that provide the color to the dish. There is no coloring involved. There are options for you to add a drink or to add a cake+ drink set. The fish & chips is SGD 12, added a drink SGD 2. Tried one slice of their sugarless black forest cake. not too sweet and i like it. You have to order at the counter and make payment first before the food is served

Decor-wise and food-wise, this place is decent but not fantastic. However, prices are reasonable, which makes it an ok place for a quick lunch. The Aglio Olglio pasta I had today actually tasted quite good, with a hint of spiciness. However, there were not many pieces of chicken and what was there didn't taste fresh (there was that smell associated with frozen chicken). The cakes on display also looked a little old fashioned compared to other cafes in the city
