Insulted. Disgusted. And angry. Why does food and service have to be so bad in a city like Singapore. It was about as good as a takeaway from the 7-11!!!
Tasteless. Unfriendly. And never going back. Waste of time.

A Japanese eatery with lots on the menu. Three of us ate well for £30/head. Lot's of choice and the service was ok. I'd go back here if I was in that neck of the city.

I'm not an aficionado of Japanese food, the helpful waitress suggested the pepper beef ramen which was excellent and good value. The evening menu is more extensive and more expensive.

This has to be one of the best meals that we have ever had!We sat at the counter facing the kitchen and we're enthralled throughout!We had the satay and the wagyu meal, it did not disappoint! It was the tastiest meal that we have ever had this mixed with the ambiance made the evening.Would highly recommend this

We started our meal of with a sashimi platter with six kinds of sashimi for $16++. For a place specialising in cooked meats, the sashimi was surprisingly fresh, delicious and value for money. The platter we tried had fatty tuna which literally melted in the mouth. After that we went for a few wagyu beef dishes. The yakitori style sticks were a little average for the price of just under $20. The wagyu beef mountain though was excellent. Although we only went for the single portion, a little over $20, the amount of soft, tender beef slices were plentiful and delicious. To wrap things up, we tried beef tongue with spring onion, although it was tasty I’m not sure it was the best beef tongue I’ve tasted. The atmosphere was a bonus as it was fun and casual and the service was a bit hit and miss, with some staff being attentive and friendly while others were a little distant and preoccupied. But overall I had a great meal, a few drinks (reasonably priced beer and sake) and left happy, so all in all, I think I’ll be coming back.

Well I have a quick lunch with colleague here and I didn't see the review before entering here. So ... I order what it seems to be good, I got good choices !First I took a homemade tofu: very good, sweet, fresh, served with chives and salty Ginger puree. A nice starter I think !Then I took the famous "Mountain of roast beef" "à la carte" and cleary it was tasty and good, not exceptional but really good. Served with a piece of wasabi sauce.So as I look to previous review, seems I was Lucky ? :-)Served with free fresh grean tea, a good choice for a lunch

Decided to visit Sandaime Bunji after reading some good reviews. I was attracted to the big mound of wagyu beef slices atop rice at a reasonable price of ~$25 (for dinner). The beef bowl set came with sides of salad, small piece of tofu and (supposedly, but I can't tell) oxtail soup. Note that the beef is served at room temp to slightly cool. Saw one diner sent his beef bowl to be heated up after his first bite. Some beef slices could be slightly raw for some people. I am not a big eater, so the beef portion was huge for me. 1 guy and 1 lady seated near me could not finish their bowls. Some of the pieces proved a bit too chewy and I got tired after a while. But no issue for my son.There was a sashimi bowl promotion where you can get 6 types of sashimi at ~$29 with any drink order per person. Must order. Sashimi is fresh and for $29, very worth it. The gyutan is quite crunchy. The staff recommended to eat with the chili pepper. Can order if you haven't tried beef tongue before.Service wise, staff is polite and professional. Didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive

All the reviews said that the wagyu beef bowl was the thing to have. The restaurant was packed on a sat night and almost everyone was having the beef bowl. However, it had to be the worst beef bowl ever. Sure, it was quite a lot but so tough and rubbery with no taste or sufficient marinade. Like I know that it wasn't a good cut and I had lowered my expectations, but still a massive fail. Just avoid or you will struggle and probably not even finish it. All those sg food bloggers who reviewed this place need to go rewrite their reviews.The lady said the clear water soup that came with the set was oxtail soup but it tasted like water with salt. Asked twice and got the same answer. But oh well. Service on the other hand was fine. Sake and tamagoyaki was ok. Prob should just had stuck to other non beef dishes.

Ordered the mountain of roast beef set here. Noticed that the serving and plating was relatively inconsistent across different days (my friends' ones looked v different).Roast beef was okay, but worth it given the price - $24.90 for dinner (what I had) and $19.90 for lunch

I brought my friend for a birthday lunch and she had the beef tower bowl with sashimi , and i had oden. Stingray fin and sake ( small bottle were added) total bill is 143. Pretty good food and love the rice they serve, just thought a little pricy.

One of the better few serving beef tower don! The 1st visit was impressive, although the subsequent visits did not get better but worse....too salty...perhaps just that 2 days?? Service is slow and there are limited seating so reservation would be necessary.

Walked in during lunch time as beef ramen is only available during lunch. Not crowded and was lead to corner of counter and found seats too stuffy and hot. Requested aircon seating to service staff and was asked if we would like to have outdoor seat which I found it absurb!!!Other than seating issue, rest of service was good and food was really delicious
4
We walk in without reservation for 4pax but could only get outdoor seating because indoor tables are reserved and full. It was a Friday evening. We tried the Wagyu beef set and the meat although prepared medium rare, doesn't taste bloody. For starving man and meat lovers, you will love the generous portion. For the ladies, you need to share with your bff

My Husband and I decided to dine at Sandaime Bunji after reading the many good reviews. I guess we got our hopes too high. Ordered the highly-raved bowl of sliced beef. It came with a side of tofu, bean sprouts and a clear soup. Presentation of the dish is good! Definitely makes one salivate. However, the beef slices are too tough to be palatable. My husband who had the entire bowl to himself had trouble chewing the tough slices. Please brace yourself if you intend to order this. I took one slice, I personally found it ok, but then again, I'm a person who doesn't mind minced burger patty.I, on the other hand, an unagi-lover ordered the ala carte unagi. It came in one huge slab. I was beyond excited when I saw it. However, I was so utterly disappointed when I dug my pair of chopsticks into it. It was rubbery to touch. A well done piece of unagi breaks apart at the slight touch of the chopsticks but to my horror, I've got to PRY the piece I ordered at Sandaime apart. Horror of horrors. I stopped after eating half of it (and that's only because I didn't want to waste the $$). The cloyingly sweet sauce makes everything worse. At one point, the sight of the unagi nauseated me.Review is purely based on the quality of food. Service at Sandaime was quite ok.

Tried the beef tongue, beef tower and wagyu beef recently. All the food is like tasting an art piece. Serve with different sauce for all dishes. Very tasty and special. Even their wasabi taste different from other Japanese restaurant and very nice when mixed with the beef. The price is reasonable as well

A meal to celebrate my birthday under S$100 was very good when I picked the waygu beef which was cooked soft and medium rare drizzled with their special sauce topped on piping hot rice. It was quite a big bowl so we shared it.We also ordered the assorted mixed sashimi of S$29.90. It was fresh and kept cold with ice.The Hamach fish head is grilled with seasalt and for this order you have to wait half an hour.We had our meal with hot sake.Jenny specially gave us a corner table for privacy ... tq for your good service.You can reach here via citylink metro station and walk about 7mins to Millenia walk near Conrad hotel.

Single or double mountain of beef!! And expect a mountain! Generous servings of tender roast beef. If you want rice, take the roast beef set and you can opt to add a side of oden. We shared some delectable appetisers - salmon harasu yaki, green pepper skewers and the perfectly made dashimaki omelette. A house specialty is gyutan which is beef tongue so we shared a plate of this. Mixed reviews on this. I thought it was like tough beef but others really liked it. It's a charming traditional restaurant so we climbed on the mat seats and sat barefoot. One warning - The service is slow. It took one hour for our mains to be served so it was good that we had some appetisers to start with.

We sat at the counter and perhaps because of that, we didn't feel that it was very comfortable. To be specific... I am referring to the non-existent air-conditioning. :( The place was very busy and while the service attitude of the chefs and waiters/waitress are great, waiting time was really long. We ordered a 9 course omakase for 2 and that took 2 hours! It took a long time for any food or drinks to be served. Quality of food is good... but I prefer to be served in a more prompt fashion. On my way to the washroom, i found out that they have "rooms" and I could feel strong air-conditioning there. So perhaps this place is NOT recommended for small groups/pairs that have to sit at the counter and that a reservation to be seated in one of those rooms (pls refer to my photos) would be better

My first visit today and definitely not the last!We came for lunch and ordered one roast beef set and one sukiyaki set.Both were nice but go for the roast beef!It was really a moubtain of tender beef stacked on top of rice mixed with barley. The rice was a surprisingly good!Auntie Jenny is very friendly. Look out for her

Great food and always nice to sit at the bar counter and see how the Chef cook your food. Friendly service and nice environment to have a Friday evening dinner here. Relax, enjoy the food with beer, sake etc...

Come hungry, leave happy. One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. And food and quality is super. I love sitting just in front of the open kitchen, makes me more hungry lol.

This small restaurant serves dishes you hardly find in another japanese restaurant. Very different and really yummy! Service is very good . It's a must try for those who like new experiences. They also have a wide range of sake and prices are very reasonable.

Authentic Japanese cuisine. Great beef tongue stew. Great oden best is their yamagata dada chamame ice cream.

Liked the spicy dishes. Avoid the soups.Great food and pricing. Ambiance is not that great but the service is pretty good and very attentive waiters. The deserts are not that great. Overall, a good evening to spend with family or friends.

This restaurant is located right by the Conrad, so it is obviously extremely convenient if you are staying in the hotel but don't want a hotel restaurant.I went shortly before closing time in the evening, which was probably not the best way to experience or judge the restaurant. The staff did not rush me, but I was conscious that towards the end of the meal I was probably delaying them in closing so I did not linger.The restaurant's proclaimed speciality is beef tongue cooked in various ways. I cannot comment on those dishes as I did not try them.The other speciality seems to be grilled foods and that is what I did try. Lightly seared tuna (fair good quality but not top quality) and an assortment of grilled vegetables, includes shitake mushrooms and green peppers. The tastes were all very pleasant, full and lightly smoky from the grill. Presentation is good, as can be seen from photos. I enjoyed a pleasant if undistinguished junmai sake and some green tea with the food.I am sure there are better Japanese restaurants in Singapore but this one is very convenient if you are staying nearby and does not break the bank. It is a reasonable option for dinner

I felt like I was in Roppongi. Sat at the bar. Food was excellent. The sashimi special was terrific at a very affordable price. The tempura was crisp and ingredients fresh. Service was attentive and friendly. I was surprised to find such a good Japanese restaurant in Singapore. It's not easy to get to from orchard road area but super convenient if you're staying at the Conrad, the Mandarin oriental, or Ritz Carlton

We had dinner in this restaurant by chance as it was one of a few located across the road from our hotel. The food was delicious, the staff put great care into the food and the service was excellent. The price was also very reasonable. I would come back and eat here again.

Happened to pass by this restaurant by chance with my family over the weekend and decided to hop in to try their dinner set. Right from entrance, service was excellent. Were seated in a cosy little corner. The Japanese staff was really helpful and attentive. We ordered 3 different dinner sets and the food was great. Beef was nice and we all love the japanese rice. Price is reasonable as well. We will definitely return
