Tasty, juicy chicken with lots of flavours and accompanied by the perfect frangrant rice!
Love the service crew who was very friendly and attentive. Excellent recommendation by her on the duck soup which!

The chicken rice is good but service can be a little rude especially when you dine in small groups, you'll most likely be asked to share a table with another complete stranger.

Average chicken rice with very affordable prices. Like the chilli sauce.
The rest of it like service, ambience etc.... there is nothing to talk about.

We ordered the roasted quarter chicken but when the dish arrived. It was the boiled chicken. We politely said that we ordered the roasted variant but one of the uncle barked at us and said they dont sell quater size roasted chicken. We have to get the small portion. Well..why didn’t he mention that earlier when we ordered? No info was written on the menu whatsoever. We hated the experience and vow to never return. We much prefer the chicken rice in lucky plaza. WORST Customer service. I don’t care how long they’ve been in business but it was appalling to say the least. We went at 3.30pm fyi..so was NOT during rush hour either.

This chicken rice eatery has been located at the same place since 1980s. The chicken breast meat is very tender and is the best. I usually prefer drum stick but for this place I'll go for the breast meat. The rice is delicious, tasty and not oily. One important note, order the white chicken only, you can skip the roast chicken. But must not miss the chicken liver.

This place is a gem, recommended to me by a Singaporean chef-friend of mine specifically for their authentic Hainanese Chicken & Rice. They serve it 2 ways, traditional poached and also poached and deep oil flash-fried to crisp the outer skin. Prior to cooking they chill the birds in ice water, lending to a fantastic, soft tender texture. The local food itself is a 5, but the atmosphere drops the overall rating to a 4. It’s a catch-22, because the while environment itself lends to the authenticity, the tables and patrons are crowded in, seating is uncomfortable stools, and service is like you’d expect out of a hawker stand. Yet there is a line, and people still wait for the food and experience. If it’s your thing, give it a try. I doubt you’ll regret it. It’s located on the 5th floor of the Far East Plaza, next to the Grand Hyatt.

Over the years, we gamely stood in the queue for a table at this chicken rice restaurant.We liked the chicken, and thus accepted the queue.Neither did we mind the eatery's narrow layout, with barely any elbow room where the tables were.Today I brought my aunt and her family who were visiting from Hainan, to try the chicken rice there. They hailed from Wenchang, home of the Hainanese Chinese rice.Alas, the chicken didn't meet her approval.A considerate and tactful person no less, she had to speak the truth: the chicken was tender to the point of being soggy; it had no bite nor the authentic chicken taste. She shyly said "not nice to eat".That challenged my conditioned opinion of the food there, and re-evaluated as I bit into the chicken. And I concurred with my aunt's discerning feedback

Amongst the top 3 chicken rice outlets serving one of Singapore's National Dishes. I have been patronizing this place for more than 10 years. I always order a plate of steamed white chicken breast & another roasted chicken breast which comes on a small bed of cucumbers, garlic infused rice & soup. Cheap & Good.Alan LeongSingapore

Chilli is spicy enough and thick. Rice is good too, except the portion for meat is too little even for a lady.Place is too small, avoid meal time...Advice for foreigners :ask for menu and take note on the price, to avoid different charges during paymen

I used to have Haianese Chicken rice here when I was working at Goodwood Park Hotel more than 20 years ago. Had half a chicken both roasted and streamed and a plate of bean sprouts. It was truly disappointing. It was not like before. The chicken was tasteless. The meat was tender but it was like my taste buds were switched off and blandness was all I could taste. What a disappointment

Very good and authentic Hainanese chicken rice. The chicken meat is very tender and tasty. I feel that the rice is a little on the hard side as I prefer softer rice. The chicken stock is refreshing too. The price very affordable!

Ate the best chicken rice ever in this tiny cafe. Service was so quick , food very very tasty and the staff very friendly. So cheap too!

The chicken was very tender and the rice flavorful.... Besides the hainan chicken, the roasted chicken is good too.

I usually come here yearly for lunch before an appointment. This time, I brought my dad along. This year, we arrived just after 12.30pm, and went to the restaurant. It had a queue, but we were quickly seated (as we shared the table with other people). Each of us ordered the usual place of chicken rice, which came with soup - it was tasty as always, and service was excellent. Consistently good quality of food, efficient service

Visited this old shop for lunch when passing by orchard road. Good old chicken rice without grills. Love the chili and ginger paste. Rice is fragrant without being too oily. Chicken is tender though portion not exactly big but it's cheap considering where it's located. $5 a plate of good old chicken rice

This place exudes a brand new level of absurdity. I have a string of invective to describe this place that can’t be printed in this blog. The food is actually not bad, but the unethical and fussy whims could hardly be more off-putting.Yes, this is where you get ripped off. And in case you’re wondering, I’d ordered for a chicken drumstick to go along with my chicken rice, while lunching with my three colleagues. After they’d served everyone else, they told me that they can’t serve me the drumstick and offered other parts of the chicken. When I pointed out that there are drumsticks visibly available and that I was willing to pay extra, they told me that I need to order half the chicken to get the drumstick. To put things in perspective for them, I pointed out that the four of us dining together would have already ordered the equivalent of half a chicken. But alas, no amount of discussion would persuade them to serve my order. They had no answer to my question as to why they didn’t make their policy clear at point of taking our orders instead of when my colleagues had already started on their meal.This place – where the customer is rarely right – should be declared a disaster area. This is the true truth as I say it as it is

I was in the area today and read a few local reviews about this place. The rating quite high. We decided to check it out. We ordered Roasted Chicken Rice. The chicken was tender and boneless which I liked. The rice was fluffy but not much fragrance in it. The soup was little sweet. The price was cheap for 4.50$Not much to talk about.. Just an average food court style chicken rice to me.

Effectively you can have either chicken rice with soup or vegetables in oyster sauce plus a selection of soft drinks. Service is quick, staff despite other reviews I found very friendly and nothing is going to cost you more $10 per person max and probably a lot less. I picked it because it was full of locals and I was not disappointed. Tucked away on the top floor of of the Far East plaza it makes a nice alternative to the Grand Hyatt next doo

This is a small joint in the top floor of Far East Plaza. Its a simple no frills eatery with a few tables that one must be prepared to share with others. The chicken rice is tasty and cheap. Service is quick. If you would like to try Hainanese chicken, this place must be on your list

I have been coming here for chicken rice every time I return to Singapore every year for the last 15 years, and the quality of the food has always been consistently brilliant, with little increase in prices of the dishes. Queues are dealt with efficiently, which is well appreciated. Definitely returning here in years to come
