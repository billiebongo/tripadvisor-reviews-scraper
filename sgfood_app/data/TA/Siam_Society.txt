Lovely local restaurant with a relaxed feel, located within a quiet housing area (Braddell Heights). Surprised by the quality of the food and generous quantities. Pleasant staff and very reasonable prices. Will be back.

This smallish and simple restaurant serves up excellent Thai food in the suburbs. Their signature dishes are very well executed. I've been there a number of times and the food rarely disappoints. Great to satisfy a Thai food craving.

Came here as the Italian restaurant was packed. The rest of the dishes are fine except for the salted egg squid which was disappointing. Grilled pork neck is a must order but do eat it fast while it's hot.

Great food, pleasant atmosphere, attentive staff, does home deliveries as well. Easy to locate restaurant but be prepared to be challenged when looking for a parking lot.

Food was average. Can easily find better Thai food. Location is quiet, away from the crowd. I used the entertainer one for one app, so it was not expensive.

We had dinner here on a wet Friday night and found it to be very good. The inside decor is fun and service is fast. The food is exceptional, we enjoyed all dishes ordered and the portions were good sized and flavourful.There’s a park next door also for kids to run around in if they’re getting a little restless.Will be back again for sure

The green curry is yummy. The Tom Yum soup was delicious. The soft crab was awesome. The Kang Kang was also very good. The place is not big but cosy. We will come again. The place is near to Braddell Rd and Serangoon Road. It is inside the estate. The food is as good as eating at Bangkok. It is really good.

My wife and I visited this place for dinner on a Wed night during the Sep school holidays, around 6:30pm.Location and Parking================Embedded within the quiet landed property enclave bordered by Lorong Chuan, Braddell Road and Upper Serangoon Road, the restaurant is located along a row of shophouse within 15min walk from Lorong Chuan MRT station.There is free but limited parking right in front of the row of shophouses. Alternative parking are available streetside in front of the surrounding landed properties. Layout and ambience===================+ Air-conditioned+ Fairly spacious+ Nice modern Thai decor+ Clean toiletsFood====The restaurant has been offering original as well as modern-twist Thai fare for since Nov 2013.Apparently, the owner also owns a Thai eatery “Soi Thai” in Tampines, where he is particular about retaining the Thai flavours as authentic as possible.Dishes we had:- Tom Yum Clear Seafood Soup (Small - $11) - properly authentic and spicy. Came with 2 side bowls and a ladle. - Pandan Chicken ($5 for 4 pcs) - Moist enough, unlike other Thai places. They were generous and gave us 5 pcs instead of 4.- Stir Fried Kai Lan ($9)- with garlic and oyster sauce.- Basil Pork ($13) - The taste was properly spicy, but there was a little too much unchewable fat in the dish.+ In general the prices were lower than other good Thai restaurants, e.g. E-Sarn, albeit with slightly less Wok Hei. + I must praise that the portions are big, even for "Small". All our dishes were more than sufficient for 2 hungry Asian pa, and can feed 3 to 4, which allows more people to order a wider variety of dishes to try.The full price menu is listed below:Soup----Tom Yum Clear Seafood Soup (Small - $11, Big - $17)Tom Ka Coconut Chicken Soup (Small - $10, Big $16) - Less spicyTom Sap Chicken Soup Small - $10, Big $16- Northeast version.

Food was served within 15min.+ We had 2 pieces of leftover pandan chicken as the other dishes were big-sized. The cashier had no issue packing them the leftover for us into small plastic containers. + The place can get quite crowded on weekends, but it was quite empty when we were there, possibly because it was a weekday during a school holiday period.Overall, a savoury authentic, reasonably-priced and well-portioned Thai meal

Located in a residential area, this place is a hidden gem. You may need to drive or take a cab if you are not living in the neighbourhood. The food is delicious and it has a good variety. Suitable for meal with friends or family. Casual and unpretentious. Recommended dishes: yellow praw curry, grilled pork neck, yellow ginger chicken, green chicken curry, tofu soup.

Near Upper Serangoon Road. The restaurant is nice, with peaceful atmosphere. The food is good, and the price is reasonable.

Excellent thai food -- the specialty yellow curry prawn, green curry, soups, and desserts all have great freshly made thai -- much better quality than the nearly fast-food restaurants in many malls. Basic atmosphere, but nice simple tables with good service and food quality.

Really lovely food, nice and spicy (though they do dull down the spice when asked).
My favourite is the somtum. Though all of the curries are pretty good too. I like that they also serve alcohol.

Had a family lunch there. Tried many of their dishes, overall good experience.Place is nice and i would say its a perfect setting for a nice family lunch. Saw lots of pickups from those delivering companies. I guess, most people staying nearby are comfortable with their food and order through online.

Having worked in a Thai restaurant in the early 90's and eating authentic Thai food had set my expectations high. I have tried Thai food when in Thailand and taste just as good as where I used to work.Before going to the restaurant, I have read the reviews and many claimed rare gem and authentic Thai food in this private estate. I chose what was recommended by various writers.We ordered the followings:1) deep fried chicken skin - delicious, a little salty.2) Pork neck - well seasoned, meat is soft. 3) Morning Glory with soy bean - decently cook.4) chicken basil - we request no chillies as this is for the kids, it turn out not very nice.5) beef curry - this is nicely cook, loved it!6) Thai fish cake - it comes with 4 fish cakes. The texture is somewhat like eating rubber, it's not nice. Noticed next table left over 2 pieces of fish cakes.

Been to this place 3 times and I totally love the food. I love Thai food and I think most of the dishes I had were delicious. My favourites are the minced meat omelette (very crispy) and mixed vegetables (the sauce is yummy). The green curry is nice but abit spicy for me. My husband loves it though. We also had the chicken cashew but I find that the meat was too little in proportion to the accompanied vegetables. I love the fact that the restaurant is tucked away in the residential area of Jalan Riang and you don't get too much crowd (woohoo! No queues!) The reason why I say it is kid friendly besides the high chair and kids cutlery. There is a long row of glass bottles that they have on display some of which are green.. I used them to sing the 10 green bottles song which kept my son entertained while waiting for food.. hope that works for your kids too

The restaurant was well-hidden at one corner. My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try since I was craving for Thai food. Indeed, we did not make the wrong choice.We ordered Basil chicken rice and Green curry. The dishes were awesome especially the green curry. It exceeded my expectations as it was difficult to find authentic Thai food in Singapore. However, the location was pretty inaccessible and parking lots were very limited. Nevertheless, we will definitely be back! :

This place is kind of the middle of nowhere - a random side street in between Lorong Chuan and Serangoon. The food is great. Real spicy authentic thai food. Fresh ingredients, fresh spice, fresh seafood. A good atmosphere, busy, friendly staff and very accommodating. I will definitely be going back

The restaurant is near my house and I use to go frequently. The food is awesome. The green curry is spice and full of flavour. the seabass is delicious with a fresh taste. It is difficult to find a dish you don't really enjoy. The place is a bit noisy but perfect to go with frien
