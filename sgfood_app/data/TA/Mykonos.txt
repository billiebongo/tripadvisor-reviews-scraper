Very busy night but entertained right away. We started with pita platter. All delicious. Mousaka was as authentic as in Greece. And the lamb chops, never had anything tasted so good. Perfectly done. No after taste.
5
Great food very authentic I live in Greece so my comparisons are very accurate if you want a change from Asian food a great place to visit
3
Been here a several times , very consistent , always good value for money , food plenty and tasty, nice seating with view over marina
4
I frequent Mykonos now. There is a selection of restaurants in Sentosa Cove but this one is the least fuss, very accomodating waitress, a passionate owner all resulting in the kind of semi-formal menu good for great conversations and an al fresco dining.
5
My most favourite place at Sentosa cove. Good ambience, kind & helpful staffs, yummy food, good vibesðŸ’•âœ¨ Its Pita Gyros is to die for. The meat cooked crispy but tender at the mid! Fantastic!!

Nice setting overlooking the marina 2 mins walk from the W Hotel. Didnt book, walked up on a Saturday night. They still had quite a few tables. As a native of North London Ive eaten a lot of "Greek" food in my life! and this is good.Service was a little slow and not over friendly, but was maybe because they were somewhat understaffed. But they got the job done, so no real complaints.Food is "international" Greek, and was actually very good. We had a very fresh Greek salad, very good grilled octopus and the best mousaka I can remember eating anywhere.Bill for two with a glass of wine and a beer was $130, so its cheaper in Islington N1, and certainly cheaper in Greece, but for a mid-range Singapore restaurant thats the going rate.Overall Id recommend it. Plenty of other options around the harbour if you dont like the look of this one. A tip would be if youre not familiar with Singapore taxis get the restaurant to call for one after the meal as they can be very hard to find in this part of Singapore

Went here for the first time as it has been awhile since we had some authentic Greek food. Was not disappointed. Range of menu and freshness of food was very good. Service was struggling to keep pace with the diners (middle of the week) and didn't seem to know what exactly was being served. Long wait for our mains (again this was middle of the week) so not sure if kitchen was fully staffed. I would go back again for the food and the outdoor dining
4
A friend and I had dinner here on a Saturday evening. I was awestruck by the fantastic view if you sit outdoor. The waterside view with the yachts are to die for! Pleasant breeze added to the fun. But that awestruck feeling was a bit contradicted with the service right from the moment we reached the resto. There were only 2 staff to attend to the entire resto which on a Saturday evening was very shocking. I'm only hoping that was maybe just a one-off cos honestly that was the only negative for me. We struggled to get the attention of the staff to place order and the food was delayed and we were told that the kitchen was very busy. So the ambiance made it easy to wait. So we waited and had a chit chat and then voila the food arrived. But all at once - Starters and main course together! Which defeats the purpose really. One would want to have a break after a starter and then get into main course. But we were kinda gulping down our starter thinking the main course is already served and getting cold. That said, the FOOD WAS YUMMY! the pita bread was heavenly and the lamb skewers were AMAZING. So the food won us over and i would certainly certainly go there again for the food and ambiance. It is all about expectations, so I might just lower my service expectation, that's it. But it is surely a nice Greek Resto

Nice environment and friendly staff at Sentosa Cove. Food are good and well serve. The owner of Mykonos suggested a family dining set up so that all the people are able to taste every kind of food. Very accommodative to serve for vegetarian as well. Will definitely come back again to this place
5
After a hard week, lots of decisions, you want a sense of ease, an escape, this is the spot. It really could be in Greece; the decor, the furniture. Waterside on Sentosa, worth the journey if you don't live on the island. Loved the starters, calamari and grilled gaviera cheese saganaki. Great main, a wrap, pita gyros, pork belly delight! Good wine, good time, good night!
5
I travel to Singapore several times a year. I ALWAYS come back to Mykonos. I always get a great Greek salad and a Moussaka. They are very reliable. Mykonos serves fresh food and never disappoints.
4
Had dinner here with my wife during a 'staycation' at Sentosa. The food here was very good and the atmosphere was lovely as well. The service was good and overall we had a very good dinner.
5
We visited Mykonos for the first time last Sunday and were pleasantly surprised by the prompt service and quality of food our family shared. The dip platter and warm pita bread was very satisfying. Salads were fresh and more than enough to share also. The baklava and olive chocolate mousse are the best desserts in Singapore I've tasted ins Long Long time.It was a real pleasure to be unexpectedly WOW'd on every level!Our sincere thanks to the wonderful staff and TOP notch kitchen
4
After eating Asian and Indian food for a couple of days, it's a refreshing break to have good Greek food in Singapore. Mykonos is located within Sentosa island along the harbour quay. Apart from the good food, I liked the relaxing atmosphere. Although the weather was generally humid the whole day, it was very breezy in this restaurant. Partly because it was right beside the quay, and perhaps because of the giant fans lined up above us. Try their Greek salad, moussaka and salmon! Their bread was also good. Service was friendly and efficient.
3
We ate here twice and both times were okay. Nice setting by the Sentosa Cove marina and friendly staff. The food isn't quite authentic Greek food, but good enough. The grade could be higher if it wasn't for the price level, which is significantly higher than your basic hawker market food in Singapore
5
Prior to dining at Mykonos I was telling my good friend how seldom it is to find a decent Greek restaurant and frankly didn't expect much of Mykonos.To my surprise and delight it was actually a great dining experience with the highlight to my double surprise being the simply cooked, well presented and superbly tasting food. Perhaps the 5 star rating is a bit generous but the food which should be the staple of every review can't be faulted.The party of three perhaps uninspiringly ordered a greek salad each, it was quite generous and the veggies tasted fresh 4/5My main was the grilled chicken and it was grilled to perfection with the accompanying vegetables complimenting the dish nicely 4.5/5My misses had the Mediterranean sea bass and although I am not the biggest fan of fish must say her dish was sublime 5/5My friend had the backed aubergines and they were packed with flavours and tasted delicious 5/5.The service was attentive and the lady serving us was very pleasant.If you want a break from Asia cuisine this place is a definite hi
4
Had tried the food in Greece, this is the closest you can get without flying to Greece. Foods were amazing. Loves the Greek salad with feta cheese. Lamb was nicely cooked to medium. However, service was a bit on the slow though I can't blame them as only 2 staffs working on Sunday night. Otherwise, I surely give a 5 stars ratin
4
We had dinner at Mykonos twice in December and both times had a pleasant meal. Service was friendly and the food was good with generous portions. The calamari, beetroot salad and Greek Salad were particular favourites along with the hot bread. It's a pity that wine prices are so high in Singapore, but the local beer is excellent
3
I love Greek food. We have been all over Greece to enjoy the great cuisine there. If you're in Singapore and you have a hankering for Greek food, this spot makes some very authentic fare. The major downside is that it is very very overpriced. A simple gyro pita wrap was $30 and another $8 for Feta cheese. And the gyro pita was the cheapest entree item on the menu!! Of course it's located on Sentosa, which is known to be an expensive spot. And you're sitting right on the marina overlooking the yacht club. So I guess you're paying for the privilege of being there. My advice: go eat Singaporean food. The country is renowned for it's amazing local fare. And most of it is very inexpensive
4
All good, really. The usual selections of pitta and dips. We shared a sea bream fish platter, and seom lamb chops and both were very good.The service was excellent and the location is great, right on the marina so it is not too noisy. It can get pretty hot in the sun!Can thoroughly recommend if you want a leisurely lunch with friends slightly away from the bustle
3
It's nice, but expensive. It helps when you miss Greek food.
The place is designed to accommodate many customers. The table for two can be a bit small. The service on th night was a bit slow.
4
I did really liked the presentation and the taste of the food, taste so authentic and the staff are so friendly.. well done.
5
Great food, service with a smile, nice views, make sure to order the Watermelon and beetroot salad, yum!
4
We enjoyed sitting outside watching the marina at lunchtime. We shared the char- grilled octopus, grilled feta and prawns saganaki with ouzo. Then we shared pork and pita bread with taramosalata dip. Finished off with Baklava and Greek coffee. All delicious with a glass of wine
2
I recently had dinner here with a large group. Unfortunately I was expecting large platters of dips and other delicious greek food, only to be disappointed with being given an entree; main and dessert. The entree was boring (stuffed tomato); the main was a choice of lamb or whole fish (nothing exciting there); and the dessert was an incredibly rich chocolate thing that I didn't eat. Overall my dinner was disappointing and I wouldn't return
4
I had not so high expectations but was positively surprised. In summary:+ good marina views+ decent Greek salad with good feta, not the tasteless one+ nice fish egg dip+ good gyros, except for some parts were too burned+ nice deco- French fries were over fried and soaked in oil (old?)A 3.5 star rating would be most adequate so I have to round it up to 4 on TA
5
Visiting Singapore again with friends and decided to have lunch at this restaurant as I had a very good experience when I had lunch here before. We were greeted by the same waitress as before ( Grace) who remembered me even though it has been at nearly one year since I was last here. Once again she was very accommodating and efficient with our orders and all with a warm friendly manner?/ smile. Again the food was excellent and the service too
4
Came here for lunch whilst the yacht show was on and was pleasantly surprised. They were very busy, so we sat at the bar, but there was enough room.Shared several dishes with my partner, being the Greek Salad, Calamari and the Gyros, together with some toasted pitta. All of it was tasty, particularly the salad which was fresh, tasty, nice oil. The only average piece was the fries with the gyros, but a minor downside. We didn't have any alcohol so bill (for Singapore) was quite reasonable!I have to say the setting / decor, the food and decent staff actually made this feel like a little piece of a Greek island (Mykonos or elsewhere!) which made for a very nice lunch
4
The location of this restaurant is beautiful, placed as it is by the yacht marina and the decor is authentically Greek. It's a lovely place for lunch although you can perhaps opt for a table further inside rather than on the outside as we did because it can get very hot. For vegetarians, apart from the mezze, there is very little choice but we did manage a pretty good lunch. The rustic bread basket comes with generous portions of bread while the Tzatziki and Fava mezze were quite substantial. We had the typical Greek salad which was good along with the Watermelon-Feta salad which tasted as good as it looked. Not much choice for vegetarians in the main course but we tried the Gemista which is oven baked rice stuffed in whole tomatoes and it was quite tasty. Dessert was a chocolate-orange concoction which was delicious. The place is expensive but the ambience is lovely and the food is good. It is worth the splurge...
5
I visit Singapore on business often staying at Hotel "W" nearby. Since I'm typically here for a couple weeks, I have all the nearby restaurants to choose from. Mykonos is one of my steady favorites. Every time I come here, I have a cold beer, lovely fresh Greek Salad, and Moussaka. The dishes are fresh, genuine, and untainted by Asian culinary influences (which I typically like, but just not on a daily basis). Incidentally, this is the only restaurant I've found in Sentosa Cove that serves a decent salad. If you're craving Greek food, come here
5
After boycotting this restaurant because of the manager, we decided to go back! The food... Superb! The staff fantastic ... The atmosphere great., good to be back!
4
Came here to celebrate a birthday with family on a Sunday evening. The restaurant has lovely Santorini inspired decor, furniture and dining ware. Unlike comments from some of the posters, we found that servers were very friendly and helpful and offered suggestions as to what to order and what would be suitable for fussy young children. We were in quite a large group of about 10 persons so had the opportunity to sample a wide variety of mains and starters. I enjoyed the robust and distinct flavors of the dishes but the portions were close to what you get in fine-dining, which is strange for Greek or Mediterranean offerings where the emphasis is on sharing. In short I am not sure this place offers the best value, but I would easily see myself coming back
5
Great and authentic decor can be done by anyone. But getting authentic Greek tastes is a mission especially in Singapore. Well these great Greek chefs have nailed it. The dips, calamari where just divine. I don't think they could have been better (just bigger). The decor was very well thought out. Even the playes and glasses where of a Greek theme. Top marks to everyone
5
ok next part for singapore. tonight we went to sentosa cove. its a new area with a great beautiful harbour. around the harbour you find different bars and restsurants with different food style.tonight we took decision on the greek foodits a nice place, staff very friendly and you could take your pets with you.food great and taste very like typical greek food. you get your typical gyros, tzatziki, fish etceverytime again

... Ordering wine a disaster. My first order of wine was a bottle of a Riesling and they brought me a Pinot Gris from the same vineyard. I sent it back. Then they came back and told me that this is the right wine that their supplier sent them. I said no. And the wines are anyhow overpriced at this place. I then Ordered a different wine vintage 2013 and they brought us a 2014. Again excuse from staff that that is what the supplier brought. I ended up buying wine by the glass and only two glasses. If you sell wine at a high price the customer will expect to get what he is paying for and not something else. You should train your staff better. They were very helpful and nice but clearly did not know anything about the wines on the menu. The food was the saving grace. It was very nice and we enjoyed our evening. But not sure if I really would go back.

This is a cute little restaurant at Sentosa Cove, it's blue and white colours look like it's straight from the Greek Islands.The food was delicious however the service wasn't good at all. They were clearly overstaffed but not particularly well trained, to us it came across that and they were competing for things to do which resulted in a poor dining experience for us. During our meal we were very closely watched, plates cleared before we were finished, staff standing next to our table, etc. The restaurant was only a quarter full so this style of service was not necessary, they did not need the table back quickly.On a positive note the food was delicious, we had tzatziki with pita bread, squid, grilled feta with tomatoes and peppers. To finish we had the chocolate cake special, however the portion size was very small.Overall the experience was not great, I have to give the kitchen credit for the food, however the service was average and it was expensive so for the portion sizes it simply didn't feel like value for money. Given the experience it's unlikely I'd return, trying one of the many nearby restaurants instead
3
I and my wife had lunch at this restaurant on Sunday 27 Sept and the overall experience was OKish. The standard of the service lowers my overall opinion significantly with the emphasis seeming to be to have waitresses at as low as cost as possible but with low cost comes poor or no restaurant training, low people skills, slovenly service - and our waitresses didn't get tipped as they didn't deserve it.The food is better than average but not top notch. You know what I mean, its not to the standard you would expect for a Sunday lunch you wanted to treat your mom to.Would I go back mmmm not so sure as there are many other restaurants nearby that look as though they are worth a shot before I make that call
1
Honestly one of the worst places I have eaten. The chicken for my kids came out very undercooked, it was still pink! I sent it back and the second lot was the same. The chef never came out to apologise. I am pregnant so very dangerous. Even for my kids. We spent $150 and barely ate anything
5
The Dip Platter (3 dips made of fish roe, aubergines and beans) was an awesome start to the meal and the graviera saganaki (grilled cheese) was just delicious.. so much so we ordered a second one! The moussaka which consisted of aubergines, potatoes and meat was hearty to our liking. Service was good. The price is reasonable considering the location it's in. I would say the dining experience there is relaxed and perfect for a casual night out.
3
Been to Mykonos three times now but my last visit was the most average. The quality of food seems to have deteriorated a little..we ordered the dip platter this time and a few of our friends were not happy that one of the dips was in fact fish eggs which was quite strong and too pungent for their liking which I think the staff should have mentioned when we ordered it. The meat platter was very ordinary and so was spring chicken and the baklava which we ended with was really dry however the orange sponge cake which was on the specials menu was quite nice surprise though. Service was attentive which was good.
2
Had grilled calamari tonight at this restaurant and the food was very average. Calamari was on a bed of very oily green salad. Expected a lot better.
3
Food okay, bit expensive. Friendly waiter. Not the most extensive menu. Wanted meze but too limited. Better than the italian place two doors down!
1
Friendly service but average food, tried it a few times hoping every time the food would improve but today we both got sick so we'll no be going back.
3
We had a meal here and the young staff were completely indifferent as to whether they served us or not. High prices charged for very average food
3
We had lunch here and everyone had a different dish and didn't share however some people were still hungry and others "stuffed" full so no consistency to the size of the dishes. The dips were just so so and if you can cook Greek food, stay at home to eat. Staff very friendly but otherwise a disappointing experience
5
We enjoyed a great dinner with family and friends at Mykonos Service was excellent. Thanks to the manager George. I recommend sitting on the breathtaking terrace overlooking the marina.Make sure to try the watermelon salad, the swordfish and the baklava.Prices are high but worth every penny!I recommend to all
5
The food, service and waitresses were fab, but the manager spoilt our evening by ridiculing and telling the girls off in front of everyone, the girls may I add were lovely and doing an excellent job. I spoke to him afterwards, but he was a last word guy, his way or no way. Unfortunately, we will not be going back after this, we used to go on a regular basis
5
While visiting Singapore we went to this lovely Greek restaurant in Sentosa. The food was excellent especially the moussaka and Greek salad, our compliments to the chef. W.e also had a very attentive and friendly waitress called Grace, nothing was too much trouble for her and she was very efficient, which made our evening very relaxing and enjoyable ( thanks Grace). When we visit Singapore again, we will certainlyeat at this restaurant again. We would highly recommend this restaurant to anyon
4
I made a reservation and requested for a great view andindeed i was given one. Do make sure you make a reservation as theyhad to turn some customers away. We went on a Saturday night and it was quite crowded.But surprisingly, food was served pretty quickly. The greek salad, grilled octopus and moussaka was great. We will definitely be back again. We felt like we were on a holidayas the ambience and view/ looking at all the big yachts was simply relaxing
4
Good mixed fish platter and a good place to watch the world go by. Would suggest booking as they were turning disappointed people away, we had the last unbooked table. Wine seemed expensive, but Singapore overall seems costly to eat and drink.We were going to eat there earlier in the week, but there was a very loud singer (out of tune too) in the next door restaurant and we left our table apologising to the waitress and went up to Museo instead
4
Perhaps it's not the flashiest restaurant at the harbor but it is very predictably good. Service is fast and portions are reasonable. I've eaten there three times and each time the food has been good.
3
we went there as people rated highly online and at one evening the restaurant closed for reservation, so we went back the next day.
the food taste was so so, could possibly we wrongly order the food.
4
Try the mezze plate - it's a cut above other similar restaurants. It's a lovely little restaurant in the day, bright and cheerful with the while walls and blue trimmings that remind you of the Greek island. The owner/manager is from Mykonos itself.And don't skip out on the dessert - the Greek Yoghurt ice cream is oddly flavourful.
4
After eating Chinese food for over 4 days we found this Greek a welcome change that was well worth the visit.The menu was predictable however the salads were very fresh and my main course of Veal Shank was excellent, the sauce was light so that the taste of the meat and marrow bone was not over powered, we had several side dishes that were equally good.I would recommend this restaraunt for the food and location as it is right on the quay front
4
Went on a Saturday evening and it was lovely to have the option of a Greek meal as there does not seem to be many Greek restaurants in Singapore. We shared calamari, Greek salad and moussaka. The food was great - we really enjoyed it. Wine was reasonable priced. Service couldn't be faulted. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice meal on Sentosa
4
Take the ambivalent food reviews with a pinch of sea salt, this is worth a visit on food grounds alone. We'd dined liked gluttons in Dubai and Singapore before retiring to the W on Sentosa for some well earned R&R. During our stay we had both lunch and dinner here, having been in Mykonos last year we were a tad sceptical about the food quality, I always am about specific national cuisines out of their natural habitat, but this was very good - there appeared to be a Greek chef which I'm sure drives the quality. The decor and ambiance are refreshing and cool and the lunch staff a treat to engage with. This is not fine dining but a good value, pleasant easy option along the strip of restaurants at the cove - we ate elsewhere and surveyed the rest, this is only place I'll wave a flag for. Make sure you share a portion of tzatziki and pitta, don't over order, and relish the moussaka, perhaps a boring choice but it's mighty good
3
This Greek restaurant blends in well with the whole sea front ambient of the quayside isle. The starter dips and bread was okay. We order one of each of the meat and seafood platter. They were passable but were extremely over priced. Service was quite good and prompt. I will definitely not come back for the food but may come back to have drinks and enjoy the festive and great seafront atmosphere
4
Noting the mixed reviews by TA critics we gave it go because of our love for the Greek Islands and very glad we did. We had a table facing the marina which was a good place to be providing you do not mind the heat.The staff were friendly and efficient, we shared 3 starters and 2 main courses which was too much and we were stuffed and couldn't finish but we will know next time. The trick (we think) is to order starters and drinks then re-order mains when ready. This should not be a problem if you are there for a no rush romantic evening. Throughly recommend the watermelon, feta cheese & mint sorbet salad.It was a tad expensive but when you are surrounded by multimillion pound yachts, speed boats & top marque cars what else would you expect?Definitely on the list to re-visit
3
As one of many establishments around the quayside in sentosa cove one would think that the exclusivity of the residences and clients would be reflected in the standards of food and service ... Sadly only tge prices reflected this for what was presented.In general 6 people ate and left with same opinion .. good not great ... something missing..The lamb is wonderful ... but too small and lost on a plate ... food average to good presentation same .. taste same .. portions small ... ambience could be .. but the oomph not apparant. Most service was good but not great ..Will try again so not terrible jist needs to bind it all together .. pleas
4
I'm not a great fan of Greek food but we were eating with some vegetarians and this restaurant offers the best choice for them. They had plenty of veggie tapas to choose from so were very happy. I had some prawns and a steak. Did not seem particularly Greek but was very tasty. Was quiet so service was good. Made a nice change to be honest
