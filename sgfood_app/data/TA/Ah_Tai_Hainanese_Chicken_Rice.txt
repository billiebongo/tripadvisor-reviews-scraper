The owner of this establishment was once the cook at Tian Tian which became famous for Hianinesse Chicken . He then opened his own shop two shops down from Tian Tian. An Tian is highly recommended by the locals.

Please skip the crazy Tian Tian chicken rice queue. It’s simply not worth your time. Ah Tai chicken is tender and the rice is nice !!!!
5
Ah Tai is the best Hainanese Chicken Rice I have tried in many trips to Singapore. Highly recommended, no need to queue. By the way it comes with free soup!

If you've had Tian Toan, make sure you give this a try. It's located in the Maxwell Food Centre. 3 stalls down from Tian Tian. So apparently the old chef from Tian Tian decided to open up his own place. I wanted to give it a try to see how it stacks up. I placed a take away order for half a chicken, two rice, and some gizzards and liver. Pricing is about the same as Tian Tian.As I expected, this was just as great. I'm surprise that this was is it that busy. I was able to order and get my food within minutes. So if Tian Tian has a long air, just go 3 stalls down and get your Hainan Chicken here

Decided to try ah tai chicken rice and see how it stacks up to Tian tianGood - spicer chili- give dark soya- comes with soupNot as good as tian tian- the rice is a bit firmer and less flavourful whereas tian Tian rice is nicer & tastierWhen it come to chicken ... both pretty similar Hard to tell the diff

The queue was huge, despite this, the chicken and rice were great as were the greens on the side. Well cooked, very cheap, relatively healthy and exactly as expected in terms of taste. Give it a go. Hawker centre food can be a slightly daunting experience if you’ve never experienced it and you have to know what to expect before you order it. You’re going to get a plastic plate and cutlery yet possibly some of the best, honest and most reasonable food you’ve had in ages.

Ah Tai definitely gives Tian Tian a run for its money - the word just hasn't gotten out yet. Was at Maxwell a couple of times and each time, there was a long queue for Tian Tian whereas you were able to order and get your food in no time at Ah Tai. I've tried both and I can say that the chicken was just as moist and tender here. What's more, you get a bowl of chicken broth with your meal, which was divine, even if it was unbearably hot and humid out. But without a wait, you'll be in and out in no time

Ah Tai chicken rice - 2 stalls down from the famous Tian Tian. The two are actually quite comparable. Ah Tai makes a very good chicken rice, and Id say if Tian Tian is a 10 Ah Tai comes it just behind at 9.I find the soup from Ah Tai better than Tian Tian
5
Chicken was moist, tender and cooked just nice without blood visible. The blended chili sauce was superb. The rice was perfectly done. TianTian was closed on the day we visited (Monday). Prices cheaper compared to TianTian. Half a chicken, 2 rice, bean sprout, liver cost us Sgd17. And Ah Tai was very friendly and accommodating. We kept going back for chili sauce refills and had to refrain from ordering more rice. Definitely coming back.

My family and I had lunch yesterday. my children and I came with a very empty stomach. When we arrived at Maxwell Road food Centre, my mother as usual ushered us center to where Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice is.But instead from ordering from Tian Tian, she goes to another shop Ah Tai.I was a little puzzled by her action. Why come all the way here from the Eastern part of Singapore to Maxwell Road and order from another.And she was speaking to the old man in the shop in hainanese, I recognized him...he was one of the original chefs from the original Tian Tian chicken rice.So with an open mind and still an empty stomach we had lunch. Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice.From the get-go the experience is already very good. You didn't have the throngs of people queuing up. So not much waiting for your food. When the chicken came, it didn't last very long. It's not that we were that hungry, but more so that the chicken was so good. So in short... Save yourself the waiting time and just go to Ah Tai chicken ric
5
By far one of the best chicken rice you can ever have.
The service is always with a smile and the quality is simply unbeatable.
4
Went to ah-tai on recommendation... was not disappointed... maybe not the best chicken and rice, but up there with the top ones... and for 3sgd really good value for money... nice hot sauce too
5
Have tried both tian tian and ah tai in maxwell. IMO tian tian is overrated, their standard has slipped and with that insane q, i would choose ah tai anytime! their chicken and chilli is top notch!
5
Tian Tian has the better rice, but Ah Tai has the better chicken -- and better value for your money. The people are nicer too -- maybe because they're not #1 and so they try harder.

Went Maxwell Market today planning to have "Tian Tian Chicken rice" for lunch. However, due to the long queue , I decided to give Ah-Tai a try instead. It was a few stalls away from "Tian Tian" and there was practically no queue. It was a BIG mistake! First of all, the stall assistant was very rude and was very distracted. He kept staring at the long line at his competitor stall. Secondly, I bought the supposedly bigger portion of chicken rice but it was pathetic. I was given mostly bones with hardly any meat. The presentation was also very bad (*sorry I should have taken a photo*). It looked as though it was a plate of scraps. For the same price, I could have got something much more decent and meaty at "Tian Tian", albeit longer waiting time. Taste was only mediocre, just like any other chicken rice stall, but the whole experience was marred by the unpleasant stall assistant and pathetic portions. If they carry on with this kind of service standards, i doubt they are able to win over the crowds at "Tian Tian". My two cents.
5
I had chicken with rice and after i finished it I had to have the same portion again, because it was so delicious. The service was fast and next to Ah-Tai is a drink shop, where you can buy your drinks. You just have to try the place, the food is amazing
5
Walking into Maxwell food centre and there was this long queu for Tian Tian chicken rice, two doors down no queu where there is a place called Ah Tai the guy there used to be the cook at Tian then went out on his own. Well we were eating the best chicken rice in minutes for $3.50 absolutely delicious so silky. Don't waste time in long que
4
We tried this spot twice - once in a comparison with Tian Tian and the next day when the Tian Tian line was crazy. The chicken rice is really good - be sure to get some sauces on the side as they don't put on as much as Tian Tian. Certainly not disappointed to eat here
4
This is the shop set up (in spite) 3 stalls up from Tian Tian by their former master cook. It's easier and quicker to get a meal here. The chicken is delicious. Honestly it's cheap enough to buy a chicken rice from both and compare, but if you don't have time or money to do so, getting it from here is just as good. The chef I travelled with still talks about how good this place is.
4
Have eaten at Ah Tai many times and at Tian Tian as well. The queue at Tian Tian is always very long unlike Ah Tai but the locals will tell you that the chef at Ah Tai actually worked at Tian Tian for 20 years before setting up his own stall. Tian Tian, imho, is overrated by the media. Ah Tai is just as good but both are also not the best Chicken Rice in Singapore lah
5
Great experience, lovely local people doing their own business, food is amazing - the EGG TARTS are AMAZING too. Glad I got of the hop on hop off bus to find this little treasure.
1
Bland chicken and rice, very underwhelming. I think the chicken in the Soup restaurant is much better. Waiter was also rude and trying to rush me. I looked around and found nobody was behind me. What gives...???
5
Went for dinner on a Sunday night at 8Pm. Most other food vendors were closed so line was pretty long. The chicken was excellent although it left me with a lingering after-taste. It si very good nevertkess and highly recommended. When Tian Tian is also open, the lines here are almost non-existent.
4
The owner of this stall was the cook for about 20 years at the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall just 3 stalls away. He got fired. And he responded by setting up this stall. The chicken is as good as Tian Tian. Most say even better. But apparently the rice is not as good. And the prices are slightly cheaper. Tian Tian's queue is always long. So most of the time, I end up eating at this stall. Order some vegetables, liver & gizzard too.
5
How great local/ street food can get? Come to Maxwell Food Centre and try the chicken in the Ah-Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice and you would see. With luck you will sit in a table with friendly locals and also try their dishes. Cheap and vibrant Food Center

We ate here in February when we were here for a day on a cruise. Wanted to try Tian Tian this time but they were closed, again, since it was a Monday. Oh well, Ah Tai it is! The courteous owner/operator told us to just go ahead and find a table, then he brought all the food we ordered over in just a few minutes. The whole chicken was amazingly tender and delicious, the rice flavorful. Everything just worked together so well. We were stuffed silly and had to give up our plan to have bai kut teh next. Now, I just want to compare Ah Tai to Tian Tian if they ever opens up when we are in Singapore in the future, but for now, Ah Tai had won me over

I came here on a Saturday around 2pm for a late lunch and did not have to queue at all. I ordered the chicken rice set meal (priced at 5 SGD), which comes with rice, chicken, pak choi in oyster sauce, cucumber and a small bowl of broth. The gizzards came as an add-on for 50 cents.The chicken was tender and juicy and the spicy and tangy garlic chilli sauce wonderfully complemented the meat. I loved the gizzards, which had the perfect level of chewiness to them and were very flavourful. The vegetables were decent and crunchy.I have to say the rice compared to Tian Tian (Ah Tai's owner used to work there), which is located a couple of stalls away, is not as fluffy or fragrant and more plain tasting. I found the broth a lovely and refreshing way to finish the meal though as it was subtly umami tasting. Overall, a cheap and cheerful meal! :

Came on a Monday and didn't realise Tian Tian is closed. However, spotted Ah Tai which had a long queue and decided to give it a try.The line went quickly and the food was very good. Bought a beer from a neighbouring stall.Total SGP 10 exactly, including the beer.A good alternative to Tian Tia
5
We originally intended to order from Tian Tian but looking at the long queu my son and I decided to go for Ah-Tai instead. As I placed the tray on the table I accidently dropped a plate full of chicken rice. My bad. There went my lunch I thought and I asked my son to order another one. He came back with another plate of chicken rice and a grin on his face saying that the proprietor gave another plate of chicken rice to him for free. It is the good chicken rice and a kind gesture from the proprietor that will lead us back to this joint for the next time
4
Had wanted to eat at Tian Tian but it was closed. So, we tried Ah Tai instead. The queue was long, about 20 people in front of us but it moved very fast. It was our turn within 25 minutes. Ordered the normal chicken rice and it tasted better than Tian Tian. Price was reasonable, SGD3 for a small one
4
Authantic local flavour, Hot spicy chilli sause. flagrant rice included chicken soup.. Clean surroundings but crowded.
5
Chicken is juicy, tender & fresh. Chicken rice is fragrant & moist. Very yummy then origin TianTian version! Must try ...
5
A foodie friend suggested that this would be her pick for Hainanese chicken and I have to say it was very good!

2 stalls away from Tien Tien Chicken Rice.
Open by the ex staff from Tien Tien .
Oily rice is a bit plain .
White chicken is soft but tasteless
Don't bother .
5
Ordered the chicken rice set, great value for money and it was very tasty. I probably should have ordered 2 serves because I was so hungry! There happened to be no queue and it was great service with a smile. Couldn't ask for more.

As I already tried Tian Tian for the first time last month. A week ago I brought my visitor friends there for lunch. I found that the chicken quality were the same for both stalls but rice here was more aroma and more flavor than Tian Tian. The soup and stir fried veggies on the set also the same. The owner seem to polite and friendly. Give this one a shot.. Less Q and quality pretty much the same or it could even better due to human error each day from both stalls.

12th June sunday lunch tasting was for Tian Tian but as usual when your there, I would usually try both and other chicken rice around as there are 4 competing stores near each other. Today Ah tai disappoints as the chicken was tender but lost out In a taste test. They are usually very close the 2 hot stalls. But today they need to revisit their recipe. We even ordered from the 3rd competition and their chili and roasted chicken was too salty, I won't mention their name there.
5
I went back to Maxwell centre for a second sitting at Tian Tian and found the queue around the corner. After looking around I found Ah-Tai and, realising that the owner was a cook at TT, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did because the chicken was succulent and thoroughly enjoyable. Ah-Tai is a worthy alternative to it's higher profile neighbou

in maxwell food centre if you go there you have to walk to gap number 3 your will find Tian-Tian after this you will see Ah-Tai Hainanses small room but service is really good and taste it okay! my sister eat Tian-Tian make me have chance to test two taste .. for me Ah-Tai is okay more tha

When in Singapore you have to try Hainanese chicken and rice. Since my hotel was just a few steps from the Maxwell Food Centre I had the choice of TIan Tian or Ah Tai. Locals said that both were good, but the line at Tian Tian was crazy, so I tried Ah Tai. It was very good. Line went fast, food was tasty and hot. Price was right. What more could you ask for?
5
Run by original Tian Tian ex chef, Ah Tai has the original flavor from Chicken rice, a must while on Singapore
Is worth the short waiting time in the line and a nice flavor rather than waiting for half hour at Tian Tian
5
There was a short wait for our Hainanese Chicken Rice but it was worth it. Tender, tasty and terrific.
5
Avoid the queue at Tian Tian, Ah-Tai's chicken rice is just as good. Maybe the rice is not as soft, however, the chilli is more fiery than Tian Tian.
5
By far, the best Hainanese Chicken Rice you'll ever eat. (and the nicest hawker uncle that will ever serve you)
4
We usually go to Tian Tian but now the word is out and the queues way too long (plus it was Monday and they're closed!) we thought we would try this, being owned by the original chef of Tian Tian. The queue was still there but definitely worth the wait and we would come back to this one again. The chicken was really good and the sauces and broth tasted great too
4
It used to be one stall - Tian Tian. Something, you know, happened, and this became arguably the better tasting of chicken rice at Maxwell. You get a slightly tangy chili sauce with the succulent meat and tasty rice, which is nice. Come early though, expect to join a long line by lunchtime
4
never been to tian tian so i can't make any comparison review. since tian tian queue line is sssoooo looonnggg and review in tripadvisor says this place is good as well so why dont we give it a try. and yes it's sooo gooodd. the chicken is so tender and smooth. rice is fragrant and the broth is full of flavour. the veggie is also tast
5
Have never tried chicken rice before for last 30+ years of my life. My co-worker couldn't believe that I'm a Chinese after all. That's it - I had a bit of his Tian-tian chicken rice and didn't really feel much special or different.... Decided to order a set from Ah-Tai as well, and then I understood why people love Hainanese chicken rice!! The chicken was really tasty and of coz the chicken rice itself smelled so damn good that I almost finished half of it after my plate of kuay tew an hour ago! Would definitely recommend Ah-Tai over Tian-tian to my friends and family coming to Singapore!!
5
I walked around for half hr or more trying to decide what to get and I'm so glad I chose here very friendly guy had bit of a laugh and was rewarded with the nicest meals we ordered steamed and roasted chicken with the steamed being the nicest by far the roasted was very nice still just didn't have the same delicious moist flavour
4
The chicken was much more better. I like the gelatinous yet crunchy skin and tasty succulent meat. The rice are not as fluffy as Tian Tian. Ah Tai's brown sauce is more fragrant and tastier. The broth soup was also good and fragrant.And, hey, the uncle is really cheerful and kind. :
4
Ah Tai Chicken Rice is great, the Chicken Rice so yummy. I heard that the Chef is from Tian Tian Chicken Rice (one of the Best Chicken Rice). but Ah Tai Chicken rice price are cheaper than Tian Tian.
5
I came on a Monday to go to Tian Tian and didn't realise they were closed, but noticed a long line here so went here instead. And glad I did, because this is just as, if not more, delicious than Tian Tian.
4
After a lackluster fare at Tian Tian. We tried Ah Tai and I would say that the latter was over rated. Chicken here was tender, juicy and delicate and it was a treat. I am very glad that we tried it.
4
The chicken rice is really tasty, but the chicken is average though its skin and meat is pretty smooth & succulent. Not advisable to go for the gizzards & livers, its a letdown. Overall it's a pass for my taste bud. Eager to find better ones in Singapore. Next stop Bun Tong Kee..
5
I visit singapore everytime the opportunity presents itself, and I always make sure to eat hainanese chicken on every trip. I've tried the most famous stall in maxwell FC, and it is great. I was in a rush this afternoon and was not in the mood to line up at the usual, so I tried ah tai, and was very much impressed. Their chicken is seriously, really, really good.
4
This is the second time I have come to the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre in the hope to try chicken rice from Tian Tian. The first time (Feb 2014) the line was so long and given the heat we opted for Ah Tai. The first taste of chicken rice from this former employee of Tian Tian was everything we hoped for. Today I intended to try Tian Tian for the sake of comparison and the see for myself If the flavour was worthy of the hype. Unfortunately I was left hanging as it was closed. I didn't hesitate in coming to Ah Tai and again wasn't disappointed. The generous serving teamed with Asian greens and soup was exactly what my body needed after a month of European cuisine. I have scratched Tian Tian off my list as it seems it's not meant to be and I will continue to support the team at Ah Tai when in scrumptious Singapore! Ditch the line and the hype and give Ah Tai a try
4
Came to the Maxwell Food Court as I had heard about how good the chicken rice is at Tian Tian but it was closed so when we got here at 9pm I noticed the line for this place was the longest! I'm no expert but what I can say was how super moist and tasty the chicken was with rice. For a few dollars its great value
4
Located inside the Maxwell Food Court, a short walk from Chinatown. I came here looking for the famous Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice, but they were closed. But I noticed that theres a long line to this place, so must be good so I decided to try it. Im glad I did. The chicken is so moist, tender, and very juicy. the rice was well seasoned, so yummy, and the veggies was crisp. Simple but Delicious. Price is very cheap.
5
I come here every time I visit Singapore and reckon the Hainanese Chicken Rice is as good, if not better than the famous Tian Tian which is two stalls to the right. It should be, the owner was the chef at Tian Tian until he had a falling out with the owner and opened his own shop. If you want to stand in line for 30 minutes just to say I went to the place that Anthony Bourdain recommends, go to Tian Tian. Otherwise, step up for the best (IMHO) Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore. I always go a whole chicken with rice and a large side of veges to feed the family for a bit over $20 SGD
4
Mr. Wong, the former chef of Tian Tian Hainan Chicken who had worked there for 20+ years, got fired from Tian Tian because of different management view and then opened his own shop a few stalls away. Similar quality to Tian Tian but $0.5 cheaper, and I can say its Hainan Chicken rice is better than Kampong and Boon Tong Kee. The Hainan chicken in Singapore nowadays mostly lacks the chicken favours, and Ah Tai is smart enough to enhance it with some flavourful chicken stock over the chicken rice. The rice is well seasoned and cooked, and the three sauces are up to the standard.
