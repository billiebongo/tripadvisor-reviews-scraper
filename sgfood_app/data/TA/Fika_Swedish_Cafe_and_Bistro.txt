Not a bad place for swedish food; granted im no expert. A little on the pricey side though seeing how i can get similar at another swedish mart at a fraction of the price

the place was relatively empty, which might be a plus point here..
we ordered the meatballs, seafood pasta, chicken skagen... didn't quite like them as some were hard, seafood was not so fresh.. the drinks that we ordered, all 3 were blend... :(

If you are in Singapore, you should try Fika. It has authentic Swedish food and a quaint, homey ambience. Loved it!

Seriously, the meatballs here is horrible. Texture is soggy and tasteless. Service is poor as well, borderline rude. Won't ever come back here again. Ever

The staffs were super friendly and their service was really good. I felt very comfortable with the environment too. Food was great too!

Shortly after my trip to ren resort Cambodia in sihanoukville, I came to fika to relax on my day off over desserts and drinks with my boyfriend. The interior and exterior didn't even look like a typical restaurant. We felt like as if we were at someone's house. Cafe did a great job with design and layout. Recommend family and friends to come here for food drinks and deserts.

Our party of 7 pax was looking forward to trying good Swedish fare but left underwhelmed. Food tasted average. Dishes were pricey considering the average taste.The standard of service can be improved. We had to call the waiter three times to change our cups as he was busy talking to his colleagues. There were bits of black rust and an eyelash in our cups of water. Our gst and service charge amounted to $26 - an amount the value of the service failed to match up to.

The restaurant looks clean, decor is pleasant and staff friendly enough. While the above mentioned are important, it should be the food that shines right? Had the Pannbiff (beef patty with mash). Beef was well marinated but the patty was dry and charred in a way which left you wondering if it had been pre-cooked. The chickpea soup was an equal let down lacking depth of flavour and the chickpeas looked as if it had been freshly poured out of a can. On the upside, the salad that came with my main course was fresh and had a light delicious dressing). Price is too steep for something novel (Swedish) yet so mediocre. Actually not so novel, Ikea meatballs have been around for a long long time.Applaud the fact this is a Swedish and halal eatery but sorry this is once is enough joint for me
