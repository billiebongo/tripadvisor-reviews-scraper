My favourite is egg and mushroom prata and vegetable murtabak. Crispy but not too crispy, generous portions and fillings, delicious curry. Casual lively atmosphere, noisy, chairs are dirty, but hey, we are here for the food.

We were hanging out for Prata on our return to Singapore and this place didn't disappoint. Egg and plain Prata and vegetable murtabak washed down with kopi-c. Brilliant

Went MacPherson outlet for gathering and we ordered their fish head curry. Fish head was not fresh. Sambal sotong was good and gravy spicy enough. Fried chicken was over cooked and meat was tough. Masala chicken and butter chicken nothing fanciful. Drinks were too sweet so best to order without sugar and add the sugar yourself. Their Teh halia has strong ginger taste;worth trying. Would suggest ordering their lychee lemongrass.Tikka chicken and channa masala were good.Only NETS and Cash Payment accepted here

The roti prata at Casuarina road is definitely one of the better ones in Singapore.Crispy and hot - though not as flakey as croissants which they may claim.Good range of curries.The restaurant runs like a well oiled machine and waiters can remember each order - and get it right most of the time!Worth the experience if you have not visited before.

I have tried so many prata in Singapore and this by far is still the best curry and prata! Do try the Plaster (essentially egg prata but the egg is on top of the prata instead of inside the prata) or you can also try the double plaster!
3
it is at it is. A cheap restaurant on India level. The prata are hand made and there is no chichi or other eye catcher. Except the man who is preparing the prata. Very clever with one's hands. Nice to watch it. The food itself is on average quality, but ok lah
3
Prata, naan (plain and garlic), fish curry, tandoori chicken, cabbage, lamb curry are all good. I have not tried anything else on the menu. The place feels dirty probably because the chairs in the indoor seating area are old and frayed and tables are not too well cleaned. In fact, the menus can be oily. Despite that, the place is very popular
3
Heard quite a bit about this place and decided to drop by for breakfast this morning. Went with my wife and son and while the place was quite crowded, our orders came pretty fast. I ordered the prata plaster which means there should be a runny sunny-side egg on top of the prata. Unfortunately, the egg york was cooked and no longer runny. Things, in my opinion, were also a little overpriced
4
We were here for round 2 after dining at the Japanese restaurant next door. We had this crispy prata with chocolate syrup all over. Very sinful but we were already having supper so nobody cared. We totally enjoyed the prata.The waiter was an impatient guy. We were quite impressed that he didn't need any verification on all the different drink orders nor take any notes... until he brought us the wrong order. Oh well..
1
previously, most of the visit i get serve with fresh prata, and recently most of my visit they serve me heat up prata made beforehand, its tough and hard to bite, i even leave eat without eating and leave the placeeven i ask for the fresh made one, staff show ignorance and just serve me the same heat up one. after several chance given to try out hope it just an once awhile case, but its happens for my past several visit, the last visit i just leave it on the table and leave the place and tell myself do not come back.however, if you get to serve a really freshly make one the prata is super nice. you may try your luck.i found an alternative recently namely spring leaf prata, so far so good, out of 10 visited so far i get serve hot fresh made crispy prata, taste is comparable to casualina, google it and try it out if intereste

Review by Dr Sim. Good consistent prata. Crispy. So far, I have not been disappointed. I usually buy home to eat. Good for tourists to try. Regards Dr Sim.

Good location with parking nearby. Service is efficient and the curry is tasty. Ample seats to cater for big groups as well.
4
Prata is good. Atmosphere still ok.
We took our dinner there. Finished our dinner and sat there chatting for more than 3 hours. Staff are polite and even took photos for us.
4
An institution. Great prata and thosai. Quick service. No frills. Staff are friendly. It's always busy.
We end up there on Saturday mornings after kids sport finished. Love it

This is my second time here in a year and i vaguely remembered that I did not have a good impression during the last visit.  Now I know why!We ordered 1)an egg onion prata and 2)a mutton murtabak, with 3)a ginger tea and, 4)ginger teh-o kosong (plain ginger and tea without sugar!).Both pieces of prata came burnt badly (health hazards!) on one side, the side that was hidden from view at the bottom!Rubbing salt to wound, the mutton inside the murtabak was way too salty!!  When I pointed that out to the serving waiter, he almost "snatched" it away and then said "chicken ok?", meaning that if it was ok if he exchanged a chicken murtabak for me.  (Do I have a choice?)  He proceeded to do that.  The murtabak that came was also burnt black at the bottom and the chicken was way too colourful(see photo for the minced chicken left behind) for my wife's liking.....another modern day health hazard (colourful = harmful chemicals!). Plus my wife said that the chicken had so much msg in it that there was hardly any chicken taste left!No doubt the prata was crisp but then again, you can find crisp prata at any other respectable prata vendor!!The tea with ginger was good and my wife said her tea-o kosong was even better with strong natural ginger flavour.  To wash down the lingering msg taste that my wife was agonising from, we ordered another teh-o kosong.  Be cautioned, it is not cheap here compared to other pratas elsewhere.....My wife coined a new name for the prata here: prata-moto!(as in aji-no-moto)..

This place has great prata and curry. Freshly made, crispy and yummy. My gal enjoyed her egg prata with mushrooms and I love my gosong with onion this time. She had her milo dinosaur too. Had tried their fried chicken, paper prata which were good too. A place to have great prata if you wants to have good curry in Singapore. However, please note that parking is limited especially during weekends.

Recently I attended a Prata party catered by Casuarina Curry. There was a Prata chef preparing freshly cooked Roti Prata for guests. All was going well until pack up time. We spotted the chef and another man who had come to help him pack up had taken a couple of bottle of beers that the guests had brought to the party without asking aka otherwise known as stealing. We know this because we confronted them, caught them red handed in the act and saw that there were already 2 bottles, discreetly wrapped in plastic bag in their bag ready to be taken away with their tools. So if you are thinking of organising something similar from this vendor, you have been warned
2
The only thing that is nice is the prata. I like crispy type prata and this is crispy. But you can get this at other nicer places with same price.The restaurant is not too appealing. The table and chairs are dirty. If you are there,please make sure the cushion chair are not wet and dirty before sitting down.We've ordered, prata, mutabak, maggi goreng, bee hoon goreng. All the food are very salty. And I've ordered Teh halia and there's no ginger taste
4
You know some places you go to because of the ambience and some it's all about the food. For Casuarina, go to enjoy the food and just accept the surroundings.The service is not spectacular but it's efficient, actually I was impressed, as we drifting through our order with a few changes along the way and almost everything was spot on (just one dish missing Chilli). The murtabak and chicken curry are must tries. The place gets busy so be warned
3
Was served by a very unhappy staff and most disappointing was the way cutlery is given, almost poking my eyes. It's a noisy environment and food is nothing extra ordinary. Price wise a little bit more compared with Jalan kayu. Overall Jalan kayu offers fast good service with good food 
5
Went to the branch at Macpherson with my colleagues for lunch. Service was quick and efficient. Prata were crispy and i love the Mee hoon Goreng too, which was soft. Their teh tarik were not too sweet which was good too.
4
Bring right on one of the classic Singapore bike routes, Casuarina serves a delicious prata. Even the traditionally soggy cheese-pratas are nice and crispy.
Service can be erratic when busy, but they usually get it right.
5
An excellent service and good food. Never tasted such an tasty Prata before. A place that should not be missed. Just located near Pierce Reservoir and Mandai Zoo, it's the best tourists spot to have breakfast, lunch, tea break and dinner. An all time favourites.
3
We had our team lunch. It's quite okay for lunch. Food quantity is sufficient. Price is also reasonable.
3
We had lunch at Casuarina curry. Food was pretty good but service and cleanliness kinda questionable. Price was ok too.
5
After our 6km TreeTop walk, we were starving. We then decided to have our brunch at the nearby Casuarina Curry Restaurant as I was craving for Roti Prata. As usual, we ordered 2 cheese pratas, an egg prata and a kosong prata (also known as a plain prata) and a plate of chicken curry. The restaurant is really crowded, I guess it is due to the Lunar New Year Public Holiday, however we still managed to get a clean seat really fast. One you have gotten your seat, a service staff will come over to take you order and it only takes them around 1 minute to get most of our food out. Talk about service!Anyway, the chicken curry is one of the best I ever had and it goes perfectly well with the pratas. I am definitely bringing my family back there again
5
It has been there for many years. First time I came to this place was in 1997. Introduced by my Brother who stay in Ang Mo Kio. Ever since been my family Favourite place for Sunday breakfast. Brought my Korean guest to this place when she visited us. She was so impressed by Casuarina chefs in their "performance" when she was taking videos of them making those Pratas and tosai.A wonderful place to go. Nearby you can have good tracks for briskwalk after your heavy breakfast. Lower and upper Peirce Reservoirs are just nearby!
5
Had never had it before and tried the normal, egg and cheese prata. They were all quite delicious, they come with a plate of curry sauce that is not mega spicy (not a hot spicy food lover).The tea that we had with it was nice, but not really my style..
1
Serves Indian food. Restaurant services are hopeless when it's full but is ok when not busy. For Prata, best ask for fresh ones , else those pre cooked can be fairly elastic ! Standards have dropped over the years and it's quite a disappointment. Not a place you will make efforts to go to ; unlike in the past . Give it a miss

If you happen to visit Singapore and are out by the Lower and Upper Peirce reservoirs, you'd find this Indian eating place in a row of coffee shops along Casuarina Rd. Very popular with the locals, the place is often crowded. The smells of spices abound in the somewhat greasy air conditioned part of this coffee shop-restaurant. The must haves would be their range of rotis (or in Singapore, Roti prathas), accompanied with a curry have sauce. Try ordering the mutton curry too, which comes with delicious chunks of mutton that go well with the rotis. They also serve a decent mee goreng (friend Indian noodles - spicy!) and a decent mutton briyani (saffron rice with your choice of meat).Avoid the fish head curry as they're not known for this. Price-wise they're about average for a joint of this sort. Expect to pay between SGD10-20 per person inclusive of a drink - I'd recommend the mango lassi!
4
Order my take away supper.. Always love the crispy prata here.. Service was not soo good but important is I get my food...
5
Definitely one of the most delicious curries I've ever had. The food came really fast, staffs were friendly and the store opens until midnight. I always come here whenever I visit Singapore. Must try: Chicken curry with garlic naan bread.
4
Overall good. There was a change in the curry sauces. Consistency is important. Prata still the best. Chicken curry was too oily today but will definitely be back.
4
Besides prata, this restaurant is also great for its mee goreng mata lembu (fried noodle with egg sunny-side up) and spicy masala chicken. Drool-worthy!
4
The pratas here are really very tasty. Not oily and a decent selection of different types. Service is efficient too. Location, however, isn't so convenient.
4
The prata here is large, slightly crispy, and taste great! Can't go wrong with plain prata and a combination of eggs, cheese, and onions. The curry is also good, it's what they are known for. Try their curry fish head, it's absolutely tantalizing.
3
We stopped by on our way home, for dosai, utthappam, and mutton curry. Very good curry and dosai, but the utthappam seemed doughy, perhaps it was cooked too fast. Also liked the hot ginger milk, which nicely settled the spicy meal. Note that parking at dinner time may be a challenge
5
If you looking for fine dining and tip top service you are at the wrong place. If you looking for a charateristic Indian eatery with decent food and.price you are at the right place.Food is nice and tasty paper tosai big and crispy and the mutton cube tender and spicy enough.Reading the previous comment make me laughing, if you looking for top service go to celebrity restaurant, if you can afford of course. Other way prepare to experience the classic unpretentious Indian Street eatery atmosphere. Keep it up
1
The food is so-so. You could get Prata at many other places in Singapore so there isn't anything special about this food - definitely not worth subjecting yourself to disgusting and terrible service, where you will be ignored by plain rude people who cannot even communicate in proper English, who deliver wrong orders and in general just do not seem to want to serve customers
1
This place doesn't deserve any ratings at all! Absolutely disgusted with the inefficient service and ignorant attitude of service staff. Waited 10 mins for someone to take our orders but everyone was apparently too busy to care. Had the courtesy to approach them myself to place my order but was rudely told to return back to my seat where someone will take my order. Further 10 mins went by but I must have been drowning in the background that nobody noticed me! Approached them again with my table number but was met with the same ridiculous answer. Have never been this upset with any service establishment or eatery here but this was just way beyond my comprehension
4
Taken to this restaurant by our Singaporean hosts we enjoyed lovely masala dosas and parathas for breakfast. If only we had similar opportunities back home!
4
Every week, We always order the following: Paneer Butter Masala + Chicken Butter Masala + Egg Prata.
Simply heavenly and good value for its price ! But don't expect good customer service .. :)
4
We always ordered their chicken tandoori, pratas and bee hoon goreng (fried vermicelli)..very flavorful and delicious!..good curry taste that goes along so well with the prata.. Will always recommend this place to get a good prata!
5
Amazing prata! Had the cheese and egg prata which melted in your mouth. Then the banana, chocolate prata which was so sweet and sugary. This place was so good I went twice in one day!
4
Here you'll get prata the size of a baby's head - which is definitely great. And in any flavour they care to come up with. Curry is superb. Two prata washed down with teh halia (ginger tea with milk) makes a full meal, at least for me. Come back for more, they've got a branch now
4
This restaurant is located in a residential area of Singapore and far from a lot of tourist attractions - I took a bus up here after hiking at the MacRitchie reservoir. Unsurprisingly the crowd here was almost entirely local families. It's not a lot to look at, either from the outside or within, but the curry is great. The star is the roti prata and curry sauce, which is superb
4
Always drive past the macpherson restaurant every Sunday on way to church but never had the chance to try until last sat afternoon. Had to pick up our kid after church music practice so we decided to eat there which is near church. It's was quite crowded but we mange to get a table for 4 inside. Ordered chicken matabab, garlic nan, curry chicken briyani and chicken tikka. Next time will try the fish head curry...staff very friendly. Good memory too as they took orders without writing down anything and got it all correct. Our food came promptly. The matabab tasted good and parts of it was crispy thin like tissue prata. Can see that all the customers in the restaurant are enjoying their meals. Many regulars as well and packed take aways too. Will be back to try more. The only drawback fir the macpherson branch is parking. Just have to find parking a bit further and walk there. No sweat.
5
My family of 5 went there. Ordered various dishes (see photos). Comfortable air-con place. Friendly & helpful staff. The dishes comes in various sizes from small to large. We ordered the smallest version of each, so that we can try more types of dishes. The Tandoori Chicken is fragrant & tender
5
been having prata from here since 1996 and tried almost everything on the menu. all are hits. no misses. best things are the milo dinosaur, fresh coconut and tea tarik. not too sure about the rest of the drinks. wonderfully crisp prata loaded with ingredients be it sweet or savoury. staff are good at remembering multiple orders and are rather attentive. they serve great thosai and curries. everything is very affordable for the portion size and having it in an aircon environment. the maggi goreng putih ikan bilis is wonderful. it's the base to all of their other noodle dishes..oh, don't try the cakes. they are frozen solid and the sponge is really dry. anyway it's a prata place! don't go there for dessert unless it's a sweet prata! the milky prata is awesome.
4
We like this place that we will actually travel all the way from Tampines. The egg pratas are crispy and go great with their usual fish curry, while the plain pratas are nice, but slightly on the thicker side.We have tried their chicken and lamb curries before, but still think the fish curry, which is served free, is the best option. They also make decent teh and coffee tarik.Service can be iffy if the place is crowded. This morning, it was fast. We were barely seated when they took our order and the dishes were sent to the table within 10 minutes
1
Prata is darker than normal, keow teow and fried rice taste bitter, like overcooked or charred. Quality had dropped over the years.
1
Prata small and taste average.
Staff are not attentive sometimes pretending not to see the customer they are busy talking among themselves. Standard of service very poor
4
If you need comfort food such as prata, quick service and are not fussy about atmosphere and decoration of the restaurant, this is the place!
We did not find that many options in the area but this was a good one.
4
Prata standard pretty good :) in fact one of the best! But the service there reduces the overall experience of the restaurant... Nonetheless still my favorite place on a Sunday morning with my family.
3
We had been recommended to the restaurant but were disappointed by being served food which was precooked, it came out to the table within 5 minutes. The food was ok but not great and the surroundings are very basic - no serviettes for your hands, no offer of water etc. For a quick meal ok but not a dinner destination
4
Finally tried this place after passing by it tons of times... We had a plaster prata (basically plain prata with egg literally pasted on it in a way), mutton Maggi goring with teh halia (milk ginger tea) and milk with ginger. We also ordered butter chicken with 2 plain nan. Total came bout S$24. One of the best places to eat Indian food that can get as authentic as can be. Though some may find the lack of service and cleanliness not up to standard, do try to give the food a taste
3
It has a variety of local indian food and they taste delicious! However, the staff that took our order memorised by just listening to our order and he served us the wrong order. Do kindly tell them they gave the wrong order and they will gladly take back the food and serve the correct one
2
The only thing I liked about this restaurant was that it has proper parking space lol! The prata and thosai was average. Service sucks big time. Informing the whole restaurant they're closing in 10minutes right after they serve our food. The cashier was pretty rude as well. Not coming bac
5
Casuarina is a restaurant with an emphasis on local food only. They do every possible combination of prata, goreng and thosai. We had prata with Dalcha and Fish Curry and tried the Murtabak Mutton. The Fish curry was very very good and the prata hot and fresh. This is not a place to go for a romantic meal or business lunch, but a place to go with friends and family for brunch/supper. The service is quick and the prices are very very good. You can easily sit here for many hours just eating prata after prata if you enjoy them as much as I do. The restaurant is clean and they have an open kitchen so you can watch them fold and cook your dish. As im not a big fan of outside hawker setting, this place is a nice change as you can sit inside comfortable with AC

I went here on a recent Sunday with a friend for a meal after walking nearby at Pierce reservoir.Initial impression was not good with dirty menus, grubby tables and seats, and surly service. The place looks like it could do with a good clean.I had a fish curry, roti prata and mango lassi. my friend had a chicken biryani and a tea.the fish curry did not taste particularly fresh or good, and the sauce with the roti prata was rather cold. the biryani was alright and the roti prata tasted OK - though unsure how fresh it was. the lassi was tasty though seemed to be made from syrup not mango juice.Unfortunately I woke up in the early hours of the Monday morning with severe abdominal cramps and a very upset stomach. I spent much of the next 2 days on or running to the toilet. I have not been this ill from suspected bad food for many years.I suspect either the fish curry or prata sauce may have been kept lukewarm for several hours and may have been unhygienic/ infected with something. ( my partner had neither of these dishes and was OK). ( and otherwise - we had identical food to each other for the previous 48+ hours)We will not be returning to this place ever again.In my opinion there are many better prata places in Singapore I have been to - which do not have such after effects
