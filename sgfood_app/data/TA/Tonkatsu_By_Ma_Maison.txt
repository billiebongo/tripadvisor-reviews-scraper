We have been to this tonkatsu restaurant a few times. It is superbly located in the Chijmes complex and so highly convenient for anyone at City Hall area. They have some nice bar seating where you can watch the chef and more table seating inside the restaurant.On our most recent visit my daughter had the katsu fillet (which is less fatty than the katsu loin) and my wife had a kurobuta fillet (black pig). I had a special momoiro katsu which was a premium cats and something to do with pink pigs. We also had a helping of katsu oysters to begin with which went down very well.The katsu were all really high quality and very tasty. You can tell this place really knows its katsu very well. All in all a great evening out. We signed up for a membership and will visit more often to enjoy our membership discounts
