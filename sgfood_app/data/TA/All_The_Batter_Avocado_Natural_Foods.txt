Nice brunch/dessert spot tucked away in a quiet neighbourhood. The avocado lemon dream is a refreshing alternative to chocolate or nutty avocado drinks.

Was checking out from Airbnb and accidentally stumbled upon this nice little cafe. Was actually cracking my head on what to have for lunch and viola!All the Batter offers desserts, drinks and food all centering around avocado, which is good for the health enthusiasts and something different from the local offerings

After all the reviews I had read earlier after the opening of All the Batter, I felt I need to see what was the hype, and being an avocado lover, I decided to try citrus pie and rhapsody for dessert. At a bite of those slices... OMG. Such avocado goodness! Clearly, fresh avocados were used, and the tart of avocado citrus was very crisp and buttery. I was hooked immediately to the avocado rhapsody. MUST-TRY. On the drink note, I was undecided which drink to have - goodness all look so good! Decided to try the chocolate one. It was a good choice - it was such a perfect combination of avocado and chocolate. I will definitely go back again to try other desserts and drinks. Avocado for the win!

Got my drink recommendation from the owner and really loved it! Was a refreshing blend of tastes combined with a smooth and rich texture. And to add on to it, it was healthy!The ambience of the place was also pretty bright, calm and laid back with simple and neat decor, nice place to chill and have a chat with friends

I tried the citrus avocado drink and a Gula Melaka cake. Really enjoyed the all natural ingredients used without any artificial sweeteners. The avocado was rich in flavor and minimal ice was used for the blend.Loved the gula Melaka cake as well, for all the flavor that it gives, gula Melaka is seldom seen around Singapore. I didn't think twice about selecting this cake to sample and it did not disappoint.For people seeking healthy snacks All the Batter is a must try

Especially loved the Avocado Hazelnut Praline Dessert Drink, was so good and fragrant. Surprisingly teamwork between avocado and nuts! Also enjoyed the Avocado Gula Melaka Cake. Have always been a fan of avocado but never knew it could be done in so many ways. :) Can feel the owners' pride and effort in their desserts with every sip / bite. Will definitely revisit again
