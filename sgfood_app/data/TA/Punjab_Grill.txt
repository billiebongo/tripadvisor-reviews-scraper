Enjoyed a delicious lunch at Punjab Grill. We ordered one vegetarian and one non vegetarian kabobs and samplers. The service is very good, and the waiter is knowledgeable on the food he served. A leisurely lunch, with right portions of food. Quite enjoyable.
5
Delicious Indian Vegetarian food if you’re visiting with your family at Marina Bay Mall. Had a lovely dinner after a day long excursion, also staff is very courteous.

Nice food. Loved the ambience. Very artistic service. Little on higher side on pricing but then you visit such places on special occasions...
5
The food, atmosphere service was great ... a bit pricey but worth every cent! The portions are quite big, so we did a takeaway of remaining food, which was sufficient for dinner!!
5
Punjab grill is without a doubt the best indian restaurant in Singapore. The hospitality is world class whether for business or personal, Chef Javed and Ramesh give a 7 Star service every time.

Went yesterday with family to have early year end dinner, very nice ambiance and food was good. We ordered Sarsoon ka Saag and Makki ki roti as we were craving for it! Loved it!
4
We were a family of 10 inc children. We had the veg set meal. There was a welcome drink, 3 starters by when we were already quite full, as we had eaten the khakras they keep on the table as a starter. For the main meal there was one daal and 1 veg, naan and biryani. 3 desserts and Paan shot at the end! If you select the set meal option then go on an empty stomac

Went to Punjab Grill @ Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, along with my family.Had heard a lot about this place. On our visit to Punjab Grill, we were made comfortable as we had gone with prior booking.Ordered the Punjab Grill version of Galawati Kebabs along with Rara Gosht & Mutton Biryani & Garlic Naan.I had never ever tasted such soft & melt in the mouth Galawati Kebabs. They were just awesome & it went very well with Garlic Naan (By the way the Naan were super soft too). Later on when we had completed our dinner I wished to enquire from the Executive Chef, Chef Javed, about how he manages to get a very distinct flavor in their Galawati Kebabs. He shared a secret with me that he uses a pinch of kebab chini along with dash ittar (He refused to disclose the name of ittar) & then just before serving it he has it smoked with charcoal fumes so that we get a mix of all 3 flavors - Kebab Chini, Ittar & the Charcoal flavors. Highly recommended.Now coming to the Rara Gosht. Here also the Rara presented by Punjab Grill is very different from any other restaurant where I've had Rara Gosht. All the Rara Gosht's taste very average in front of preparation by Punjab Grill. Had I know that even the Rara Gosht's taste would be so outstanding in taste I would recommend to all those are reading to review to just order for one dish per visit. What happens is that by time I've finished my first dish I'm left asking for more of the Galawati Kebabs or for that matter even the Rara Gosht. Now coming to Mutton Biryani. What can I say about this dish. Just the right amount of spices & extremely flavorful. It was served to us the Punjab Grill's signature Raita - Boorani Raita. Very creamy, not too thick & just the right amount of garlic flavor. Not too overwhelming. It's slightly high on prices but all good things in life don't come cheap. Don't mind an extra few bucks if you are more than satisfied with the wares dished out in a restaurant.I just couldn't resist but a picture with the Master who weaves magic of flavors in whatever he prepared with all his passion and love.

We went there last night for dinner with my daughter. The waiter was polite and offered us the table that we required . It was not very busy for a Saturday night. We asked for a drink list . We saw the wine list and saw the house pour wines since I needed only one glass. It was $ 28/- for a odinary Italian wine. We ordered a glass and the waiter came with an open bottle. On tasting it I said that it was off. The waiter immediately brought a new bottle which was OK.Since we are a large wine importer in Singapore we mentioned that $28/-very expensive for one glass of house pour. The manager said that we were at Marina Bay Sands and it was an Italian wine, just to mention that we were not aware of our surroundings. We ordered just two dishes. No starters and no main course. The Palak paneer was very spicy and when we mentioned it the manager brought it again a little milder.The bill came to $200/- for 3 of us. The manager then tried tomake it up by giving us free dessert. I think it is a rip off as the Kebab platter was ordinary and so was the food

I had a great experience at Punjab Grill in Bangkok. Assuming this would be same, I made a reservation and got there at my time. I was informed that if we make reservations after 6 PM, there is no guarantee that "they received the request". Since they stop checking online requests, till the time they send an acknowledgement, the reservations are not made.So we get past the reservation issue and I get seated. I ordered the food - Pindi Chenna and Roti. The dish was mediocre at best. Given that there are so many other choices in Singapore for Indian food, I will not be coming back again
5
Punjab Grill is the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. Amazing dishes prepared by Chef Javed which are not too greasy. The starter plate has innovative element and excellent. A must try for all in Singapore .
5
Gordon Ramsey next door was full with 1 hour wait for an unimpressive meno so we went here which was half empty. The staff were a delight, the food was varied and very tasty. Altogether an impressive , cost effective experience - the place deserves to be better know
4
Came here again after visiting in December 2014, Located at the Marina Bay Sands the restaurant offers great Indian Food and have a nice ambiance as well. The prices are also as high it can be like a meal for one costs around SGD 75 without alcohol. Having said that, the place deserves a visit once in town for a meal which will give u some good taste and food experience
5
The restaurant is well designed and located inside the Marina Bay shopping complex.I had their signature lamb curry (similar to a Rogan Josh) and naan and the food was excellent. The lamb was succulent and the curry well spiced. The potion was also good and enough for tow people if you’re having starters. I also asked for it to be made extra spicy and they obliged. I had Gulab Jaman for desert and it too was excellent. The only gripe I have is that the beer is extortionate. I had a bottle of Kingfisher and this was near Singapore $20 plus service etc. God knows how much spirits and wine would be! I know Singapore has becomeExpensive, but almost £12 for a bottle of beer that I can buy for just over a £1 in London supermarket is crazy.
4
I must say that the good quality and service is top of the line.The ambience, presentation of food, quality and preparation of food and service is very good and the place is very clean.Every item of the vegetarian lunch we had was finger licking good.The only drawback was the expensive priceOverall excellent
5
Highly recommend!! Came to this restaurant with my family after visiting the Skybar. Highlight of our night! Best Indian food we have enjoyed in years. We ordered vegetable samosas, tandoori prawns, butter chicken, naan and saffron rice and a very nice California Chardonnay. We enjoyed the complimentary amuse bouche from the chef. The samosas were so fresh and not oily at all. The prawns were beautifully grilled. The curry was tender and full of flavour. We found there was a good amount of spice and kick for us but it wasn’t too hot. The restaurant decor is chic and sophisticated and service was prompt and polite. My only criticism would be that the menus are difficult to read with the black paper.
5
The overall experience we had at this restaurant was amazing. Me and my partner are vegetarians and oh boy it was difficult to find any decent vegetarian food in Singapore. We were visiting Singapore for 4 days and staying at Marina Bay Sands. We had very limited options elsewhere in the area. The MBS , had given the booklet of the shopping mall and I glanced at it and found Punjab Grill listed there.So we found this restaurant behind the escalator, which we missed the first time looking. The food was amazing and we loved it. The overall experience was awesome due to the great customer service ay the staff. Would recommend everyone to try. Thank you providing delicious meal
5
We were there twice for dinner. The ambience is just amazing and so is the good. Staff are friendly and professional.great vareities of good for both veg and non veg. Costs is a bit on higher side but worth every penny. They always have something on the complimentary side which is yum. The presentation of food is eye catching.kudos to the team great job !!

As a regular to Punjab grill, More because of it being in the office area and also for entertaining I personally find the place a little over rated. This round we saw the crockery chipped and my wife commented that the amount they charge they can easily replace the crockery. The menu is a little difficult to read given the dim lighting an colour selection of black background and gold letters. Food is ok. They served papads instead of khakras that they usually serve. The breads were ok. Out of the 3 veggies we ordered the mixed vegetable was fantastic. Paneer makhani had literally just 10 pcs of paneer. When you charge top dollars it is better to not save on such things
3
We had a three course meal. One starter was ok and the other was ‘thuka hua’..in english, lousy.In main course, panch Ratan daal (5 jeweled daal) was ratan less (jewel less). Burnt and tasteless. Saag was tasteless (tadka, garlic, fried onion missing).In dessert, faluda Kulfi was lousy and the kullad kheer came at first without the kullad!To top it all, to garnish the experience, they have a stubborn Managar who doesn’t agree with any of this feedback.I hv rarely put -ve feedbacks and unfortunately this is one such occasion. I hvn’t yet checked the bill. I hope I am not surprised there as well..What else to say..avg restaurant at best!
5
Chef Javed presents Indian dishes in ways I have never seen before. After visiting Punjab Grill I found out that Indian dishes can look extraordinary.
Each dish is a surprise experience.
4
A really great lunch set, priced to the standards and tastes new to even Indians. They give a twist to all their starters that gives an unique flavour.
Service can be improved with smiles.
5
we had amazing Jain food in marina bay ......we loved the taste which was perfect as Indian taste.....they made special jain food for us.....
5
We Have a weakness for Indian and Pakistani Foods, so when we decided to eat At The Punjab Grill, We were blown away, Chef Javed's Presentation of Indian Dishes, is Simply Amazing. The amazingly courteous staff, just adds to the great and at ease ambiance of the restaurant, Simply Amazing Dinning Experience, well worth the money, We will Definitely be going back for More
5
We were wowed by Chef Javed's selections while we were there for lunch on 26th October. From appetiser to dessert all were delectable, stupendous and fulfilling. Truly amazing and will definitely recommend to all who have the preference for refined Indian cuisines. Oh yes not forgotten the comforting ambience and do ask for near Tandoor oven seats...trust me it's worth it, immense into the kitchen experience. Be back for more
5
I have visited Punjab Grill last month & that was such a wonderful experience. The quality of food & a courteous service & staff will make you visit this place again & again. You all are awesome & keep doing well & would love to visit again

Recommended by our Hotel, this restaurant needs to rethink just about everything.It is at Marina Bay Sands but in the shopping Mall so no views or scenic drama of the waterfront properties.From the less than friendly greeting to the massive bill, we found the night frustrating and confrontational.We where charged for food we did not order. (Embarrassing argument ensued)The food we ordered was far too much for the four of us, but no one advised us that we had over ordered. We left more than we ate. We asked for guidance when ordering. In fact we where encouraged to order more .The food was OK for a local Indian that one would have as a mid week treat. Nothing about the food screamed high end. Presentation was lack luster and flavors nothing more than a regular Indian Restaurant .Poppadoms soggy.Rice arbitrary Starters potato fritters basically flavorless heavy mashed potato fritters. Wine was like warm and over $100 for a basic verdhello...The staff completely disinterested and unfriendly.A horrible expensive disappointment
5
Tried the Kebabs and Biryani feast for lunch and it didn't disappoint. I had visited Punjab grill once before and the experience then was a bit disappointing then. I gave them a chance once again and I am glad I did. They have redeemed themselves. Staff was friendly, food tasty and ambience was good. Reserve before you go and try and sit inside. Sitting outside kills the experience a bit. Recommended.
2
We were 3 ladies dining at the restaurant. Ambiance and food are great. However the service staff was not only unfriendly, he was intimidating. As much as the food was great, it still seem overpriced for Indian Cuisine. Hence, we enjoyed only to a small extent.
5
This is not the cheapest place to get a curry in Singapore but man it's worth every penny.We went a bit mad on the order but the waiter very polity told us we my not be able to eat all we had ordered and suggested we remove the starters, which I thought was a lovely touch.Great food and great service, you can't ask more than that
4
Very polite service,
Authentic Indian food,
Atmosphere quite pleasant,
Liked best: lunch set menu - good value of money, refillable bread and rice
Liked least: none so far.
5
If you are looking for Indian food and restaurants in Little India disappoint you - Punjab grill is the place for you.
Great ambience, service, food. Overall a happy experience :)
5
Great food, ambience and service. We ordered 5 course meal and it was a good sample the most recommended dishes in the restaurant.
However, unlike other restaurants in their neighbourhood, they do not offer complimentary parking.
4
The Restaurant is within a high end mall. It is very nice interior and the food was nice. The service was very good and the waiters were great and mentioned on their own that we may be ordering too much food for the four of us and they were correct. I was impressed with their honesty. I would recommend to visit if in Singapore
5
If you are looking for the best in class North Indian food, don't look anywhere else in SG. The best you can ever find in the lion city ... the set menu is value for money and caters to the hungry eaters too. The staff there are awsome - ever smiling and willing to help . Will keep going there for special occasions . Highly recommended
5
We went with friends and ordered the set meal. This is a great feast with very nice food and wonderful taste. We ordered the vegetarian meal and they also have the non veg meal as well. Mind you this is available only on weekdays. Bit expensive but value for the meal
5
We had the 5 course degustation menu each. It costs $98. Pawan, our waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. The main course was a bit much. We were struggling by the end of it but the food was just exceptional. They tailored the menu to suit our dietary needs. I am a pescatarian and my other half is allergic to nuts.
3
I went with my wife and son on Sep 2 to this place for the dinner. We ordered many things like Dal Makhni, Malai Kofta, Dahi de Kabaab etc but the taste of each dish it seemed was tweaked to match the taste buds of typical Singaporeans. So if you are planning to go there to have authentic Indian taste by just seeing name Punjab Grill, then sorry you will be disappointed!! And for all this remember it will burn a hole in your pocket. For a typical dinner it will cost you around SGD 200-250
5
In a city with such a vast choice of food and the Little India area, I was unsure if this would live up to expectations. It did and much more besides. It is in "The Shoppes" area of the Marina Bay sands complex, not the hotel itself. A welcoming warm decor and friendly greeting set you up for a great dinner which you can watch being prepared through the glass window to the area with the ovens. We love various foods from India but we are not experts so our waiter was extremely helpful in directing us based on our descriptions of spiciness and preferences. Even cautioning us that we may have ordered too much. We decided to order a dish each and share. The meat kebab starters were amazing. Meat beautifully cooked with seasoning and sauces balanced and perfect. The main course selection was just as good. A real treat
4
Ambiance – it’s a clear winner mainly because of location. I mean it’s in Marina Bay Sands – one of the most prestigious addresses of Singapore. The whole place looks quite glam. Still, the ambiance of Punjab Grill doesn’t intimidate you. It makes you comfortable.The restaurant has a chic and modern take on the glamour of Indian royalty. You do feel like a cool Royal here…Neat, clean,classy!Lots of choices and as a vegetarian, I didn't have any difficulty to enjoy the food fare here
5
A classy very welcoming restaurant to dine in. Good Customer Service and excellent Chef. Delicious foods with vast variety of choices 👍
5
Lovely and great ambience. A cosy dining place for couples as well as families. Attentive staff who are friendly and paid attention to details. Overall, a delicious & lovely dining experience!
5
This is a lovely and romantic restaurant. Staff was very attentive and friendly. The food was of great quality and varied. Not cheap but certainly worth the money!
5
We had the 5 course Degustation menu. It was good because it helps me with deciding what to eat. This set gives us a variety of dishes.
4
One of the best indian food restaurants I have been to. Portions are of good size and big! Need a little work on their cocktails but other than that it is a great restaurant with a good atmosphere.
5
Excellent food and service at Punjab Grill. My daughter needed gluten free meal and they went out of their way to ensure that they gave a description of ingredients for each plate and the meals were fantastic.
5
I had dinner with my friend at Punjab grill It is one of the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. The ambience is very grand and the service is superb. All the food was amazing. especially mutton kabab and dal makhni .
5
Had lunch at PUNJAB GRILL , cant express in words yummy and tasty food .
Extremely polite and efficient serving staff
5
Being here with Friends farewell Bday lunch Party .Being an Monday , the place looked quite full but we had reserved the table so no worries.We tried their set Power Lunch menu which was at 58 per person which came with an Drinks & a lavish Spread of food .The food looked eye appealing & well presented. Full off Flavours & yummy...!!The quality & Quantity of Food was far better than I have tasted at other places in India .Desserts were mouth watering & enough .we ended with Chilled Paan Shot .Specially I liked the little small things they do before & between meals & the Wet tissues .Being new in Singapore haven't eaten out much yet but this was worth giving an Farewell treat to My Friend .Will visit again soon as Its bit Pricy to eat regularly

Hi , The hype around punjab grill fell way short food served , taste and overall experience . We choose this restaurant on my birthday 18th july , terrible choice
5
Ambiance of the place is great! Service is top notch! Food are very flavourful and prepared to perfection. Highly recommended.
5
Had a lovely lunch with my friend Sam. He knew what to order so was spoilt for choice and selection. The biriyani chicken was fantastic, as were the chicken tikka and the vegetables and naan bread.
Had desert and drinks as well
Highly recommend it.
5
The only good restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands complex catering Indian Mughlai/punjabi food, has a large variety of delicious vegetarian and non vegetarian preparations.
3
Good Indian food, however quite expensive. Service was ok, no more. As the restaurant is located in a Shopping mall, do not sit too close to the entrance door as it could spoil the "ambiance".
4
the food presentation was good overall. the power lunch was surprising. the waiters were knowledgeable
4
Good Indian food is what you get here with nice service. however the prices are on higher side. location is nice
4
Service is really good, the food are good too, not sure if i will come back as the price is high:) worth trying
5
What a lovely find this place. Of course very pricy restaurant not for everyday meal. But the food quality and taste here was very good. We like spicy north Indian food and asked for the gravies to be made spicy and they turned out to be just perfect. The daal makhani was very yummy and paneer was super soft. The staff is very courteous and ambience is good too
5
I visited this Indian restaurants with high expectations and didn't disappoint indeed.I took the 5 course menu sample and all the food was delicious, extremely well prepared in a very nice atmosphere.I managed to eat almost everything but I must admit that it was perhaps too much. You should come with good appetite if you want to finish off the 5 course menu.It is a fine dinner restaurant and the price goes in coherence. Worth taking from time to time
4
Excellent food, well presented and great ambience. The food kept coming and we could have had any number of servings of our favourite dishes. But we stuck to the plan of trying a little of everything that was served. The 5 course meal was pretty pricey though.
5
Visited this restaurant for lunch n dinner.. best Indian food with good service. Worth spending extra money for such quality food
5
I had food from Punjab grill, it was a great experience. Food was awesome and their customer service was laudable..
5
With Chef Javed in the kitchen, Punjab Grill provides an unparalleled gastronomic experience for any event. Served by experienced staff who have always made my dining experience memorial in all aspect.
5
This place is from my favourite list. Good people good ambiemce & above all good service.
Overall it was a good experience.
The entire team deserve more than 5 in all aspects.
5
Me & my boyfriend had extremely great evening here with very polite & courteous staff & excellent food. The ambience & music is a addition to make this restaurant beautiful.
Best choice of menu & i will suggest people to visit ones....
4
My wife and I had a lovely meal here during our stay in Singapore. The food was very flavoursome and the service was first class with the servers being very attentive. Would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try fine Indian dining whilst in Singapore.
5
I have decided to visit Punjab Grill since its popular for known one of the best Indian cusine restaurant in Singapore located at marina bay sands mall. Started with Mango milk shake and khakhra with 3 different chutney which is just nice to start with, next course was crushed potato and crisp spring roll with sauce first time that i have tried spring roll so much crunchy and tasty, next was the mix kebab platter Lamb, smoke salmon and chicken amazingly plated with garnished, Main course was Dal makkhani and butter chicken with khulcha and garlic naan which was so delicious i felt like i am in Mumbai. Dessert was fabulous kheer and pista kulfi.The menu was nicely balance between all those popular dishes, service was very attentive and focused.Thanks to chef Javed, Restaurant manager Mr. Ramesh, Ishan and Team for making my dinner so memorable definitely ll visit again.
5
We had great dining experience at Punjab Grill in Mumbai and had high expectation from Singapore outlet...and we were not disappointed.We made reservation for Saturday evening and reached 10min before time. They allowed us to choose siting basis our requirement of Aircon and the staff was very attentive through out the evening.We ordered Dahi ke kabab for starters which were really yummy and followed it up with Makke ki roti and sarso ka saag which comes with white butter and jaggery for traditional taste...portion is good and we were completely satisfied with taste. They also provide tasting menu throughout the evening which were really good.This place is expensive than most Indian restaurant in Singapore but the taste and experience make it completely worth the extra dollars.Will definitely visit again and would recommend anyone who wants fine Indian dining experience
4
Visited with some of my colleagues from office. Good choice. Food was excellent and the service was great. Expected a better choice if alcohol including singal malt bit dissaponted with the choices available. The food came to the table in relative quick time was nice and warm. Will visit again good place.
5
Singapore's Best Indian Restaurant for Authentic Punjabi Food.Today, we had a Business lunch at Punjab Grill @Marina Bay Sands and we all love it.Location : 5* (At The Shoppers Mall)Ambience : 4* Food : 5* (Kabab was Fantabulous)Service : 4.5* Vibe : 5*Price : Fair Note : Head Chef Javed personally paid attention to our visit.Highly Recommended!
5
We had an extremely enjoyable evening here, with excellent food and, despite being very busy, great/prompt service too.
5
They got excellent food and the nice ambience. It is worth burning your pocket. We took 5 course meal and enjoyed every bit of it.
5
Absolutely divine!!! The food, the setting, the staff all are amazing. The food is out of this world. A must try and you will go back again and again and again
5
I've been to Punjab Grill on numerous occasions whether it be for business, pleasure or for celebrations and each and every time it has not failed to impress with flying colours. Whether you are ordering a la carte or taking one of the special menus (which are very good value for money), you'll find the offerings well grounded in flavour profile using only the best sourced premium ingredients. Top that off with an innovative yet highly palatable spin on flavour combinations with refined presentation to make an unforgettable culinary experience. Everything from the signature curries to naan basket and biryani are done impeccably however I am always impressed with the grilled dishes- in particular Chef Javad's lamb which is by far the best I've had at any restaurant Indian or western in cuisine. The tomato soup is also to die for being a tomato soup and shorba fanatic. I would recommend coming in a group so you can try more or enjoy the whole tasting journey. We all have our favourite go tos when it comes to cravings and hitting the spot. When it comes to my Indian fix, Punjab grill is where I come running. I would not hesitate to recommend or bring anyone with a great palate for Indian cuisine to this restaurant
5
We arrived quite early for dinner around 6:30 and we were able to choose almost any table. Later the place quite filled up. The food was really excellent. We started out with a delicious lobster. Afterwards we had fish and great curries. The chef came by to hear if everything worked out
1
After contemplating me and my husband decided to go for their 10 course non veg meal...The course started with a gol gappa and it was awesome...followed by chicken soup with a few pieces of almonds..sounds exotic..sorry to dissapoint but it was extremely salty...however we didn't complain much abt itFollowed by starters.. 1 piece each of mutton chop, tiger prawn and salmon fishWell served looked exotic.. however as they say don't judge the book by its cover holds absolutely true here.. when we dug into the mutton chop, it was tough as ever and refused to cut... we returned it only to get a burnt lamb chop in return... the tiger prawns were tasteless and over cooked..Ended up not eating the starters..To change our pallete we were offered raspberry sorbet which was a refreshing change..Then came our main course which started with a small portion of mutton biryani.. once again mutton was tough and we couldn't eat followed by the main course which had butter chicken (Murgh makhani), fish and kali dal and a basket of rotis.. tasteless absolutely and we ended up wasting the main course as well..Followed by dessert.. well decorated chipped plate.. by the end of our experience we were left with no words to complain anymore for a "fine dining" restaurant...We indeed had a great time with some terrible palate and a bomb to pay for (not)eating uncooked tasteless food..Never to visit this place again..
5
came here with friends and we all had the vegetarian menu and I was definitely convinced. it was way too much food, some out of the ordinary items and it all tasted very good. biryani was great, as were the appetisers. it was all good except for the desserts... but I'm not a big friend of Indian desserts in general so it might be just me
3
More veg options, vegan friendly and fusion food including chaat items would be great.The fusion food could be Chinese Indian, Western Indian etc. A kids friendly menu would be a plus point too
5
This is the original and authentic Indian restaurant. It has original flavours of Indian food in every mouthful. Food was awesomely delicious. Presentation was excellent. Service was seven stars, despite them being full house the wait time was reasonable and waiters extremely attentive and efficient. Ambiance superb, makes the dining experience Royal.Their miracle napkins are just WOW!I have been to numerous Indian Restaurants in town but none come close to a Punjab Grill experience. Highly recommended! A must try!!!
1
We have eaten here in the past and the food was ok... last week for lunch it was just too bad.. i wonder how can a fine dine place like this get away with this kind of food. They need to pull up their socks soon
4
My family had our dad's 60th birthday celebration. It was a little tough ensuring the reservation was confirmed but the service was great & food was special. Punjab Grill made the effort to include a birthday surprise for the birthday man.
3
The food was good, but not as good as Yantra or Song of India. I also didn't like the ambience as much as I like the other top dollar Indian places in Singapore. It wasn't a bad meal overall, just not a really good one.
5
Go for the Makki ki Roti and Sarson Ka Saag... outstanding.
Nice Indian drinks - jaljeera shikanjvi
Good plating for golgappas
Fantastic desserts - kulfi / falooda to die for
5
Awesome food , awesome experience.. friendly staff with much patience. The warmth of their service and yummy food won 5 stars rating .. highly recommended place for lunch or dinner , both
Keep it up guys ..
4
Good quality food. Not particularly mind blowing for the price, but still good. The dessert sampler is generally very good.
The staff was particularly helpful and service in this restaurant is very good.
5
Since from Mumbai , Was well aware about Punjab Grill, I visited Punjab Grill at Marina Bay Sands while on a trip with Family .We tried their Chef tasting menu & this took us to an ultimate journey to Royal cuisine with Mouthwatering dishes & best part was the way they presented all the Courses, totally stunned to see Indian food in this new version .Not only the food but also the Service was spectacular & flawless.Their menu choices are also vast & beverage choices looked impressing...!!We ordered few House special mocktails & Cocktails which were were good to .Don't forget to have the Paan Shots & the Magic Wipes..!!The place looked busy but we were given an good experience to talk about.One of the best Indian Fine Dine restaurant I would have Visited so far...!!Will visit again whenever in Singapore .Pooja

We visited for dinner, family of six with teenage children. It is advisable to pre book the table to be safe as we did. The food and service was good but I was disappointed with the common sense of the manager himself as he offered the BAR menu to my teenage son and when I objected instead of apologies he gave explanation that the same contains non alcoholic drinks also. This is totally unacceptable and disappointing
5
Once again I decided to visit Punjab Grill with my friends and I forced them to come along with me and believe me all where very happy after completing the meal at the end . The service Given from them and excellence the food with finger licking gravies Made our Lunch Great. It's like seating in India and enjoying Indian food with proper ambience & service team as well , hope to visit very soon & enjoy such marvelous food
5
I have been to Punjab Grill at least 5 times now - where i have tried both their fantastic and reasonably priced set lunches and the more extravagant dinner menus.And each time, I walk out completely satiated. Their generosity with portions, the careful thought to each dish and adding unique touches is what i appreciate the most. The must try is the Kebab platter. It comes with a variety of meats, individually plated and marinaded so the flavours are all distinct, not the usual similar orange-hued kebabs that you might see at other places.There are other great Indian fine dining places in Singapore too, but there is just something special about the way the chef plates and presents his dishes - you can just feel the warmth
5
Fabulous dining experience which is always coupled with impeccable service from the team there ! The minute you enter you will be welcomed by " a daily special canape " from the kitchen.Must trys - Lamb seekh kebab, dahi ke kebab, tandoori brocolli, salmon fish tikka, sarson Ka saag , Mirchi paratha and their entire selection of Desserts !! Pan shots are the most perfect way to end the amazing culinary experience ..Best thing -- they continue to improve their service and innovate the food. Their food has authentic taste and flavours ! Keep it up !!
4
Punjab grill has a nice ambiance and amazing food. the produce is fresh and they have tandoori items which unqiue such as duck and scallops.
5
Punjab Grill is famous for its Superb Quality and Superb Taste. Be it in India or Singapore, Punjab Grill is the best option of India food one can have.
Been here multiple times, bit costly but believe me its totally worth it.
5
Best Indian Food to have in Singapore , good ambience.
Veg and Non-Veg both options are very good , try their dahi ke kebab...
highly recommended .. Costly but worth to spend against the quality of food.
2
Nothing Extraordinary ..Surely not worth what I paid for. The Chef's special Amritsari fish was quite tasteless. The food was ordinary / average.

So I visited this restaurant with my family last night and the food was good, not bad, quite bland I would say in terms of spices. But overall not bad for Indian cuisine at the Bayfront.What disappointed us was that my husband ordered an orange mojito which tasted good, though he commented he can hardly taste any alcohol and that's why he was enjoying it even more, after that he ordered one more of the same drink, this time the taste was Not as good as the first one.When we asked for the bill, he saw that he was charged for 'double' alcohol mojito, basically two drinks with double alcohol. Now the reason I am disappointed is because the waiter did not ask whether my husband wants double alcohol or not, he just assumed, and bought us two drinks which didn't taste like they had double alcohol, and charged us for it. I don't think any restaurant does this, either the waiter asks or the customer specifies that he wants double.My husband being too courteous just ignored this, we called the waiter and he said he made the drink himself and it was double and that he was not lying. Point was not that he was lying, point was that it shouldn't have been done this way

Fluffy naan, tender lamb. Food here was great! Meals here are on the pricier end, but you could also use the Entertainer app to get a 1-for-1 deal. Overall, I'd say you're paying more for the ambiance, as you could get food of similar quality for more affordable prices elsewhere too

We made a reservation at Punjab Grill for 6:30 pm when it opened for dinner. Ours was one of only two tables that were occupied. Their wi-fi signal was strong. We saw on the menu that butter chicken was a chef's specialty so we ordered a glass of sweet wine and butter chicken. Cheese naan was not on the menu but they made a delicious one for us. They gave us an amuse bouche. The portion of butter chicken was large enough for both of us, and it tasted very good. But the taste was not much different from that in less expensive restaurants. Our server never smiled. We suspect that it would have been wiser for us to order ran or another dish that only a large restaurant can offer. We did appreciate that they had the sweet wine that we liked. Our experience was somewhere between average and very good

First of all I am not a fan of Indian food at all. But the location of the restaurant and its look convinced me to take a chance. It was not a mistake, I must say. The food was delicious. I opted for less spicy dishes, like restaurant's special lamb curry, whereas my wife, who on the contrary likes Indian cuisine very much, chose spicy chicken curry. Both left the place very satisfied

A journey through Punjabi cuisine !!It was really warm welcome to cuisine has reached top notch in Asia !! We had really a very excellent meal ! Spices has perfectly blend in each courses ! Service staff has really well and professional ! Very help ful !!We had started our meal with well crafted Amuse Bouche by chef hands ! It was really a truth magnificent experience!

Although the name suggests that the food served here will reflect a different selection of food from the usual North Indian restaurant, it actually serves mainly the same type of food you would find in any North Indian restaurant. Nothing to complain about the food..but nothing to praise about either. Service was a bit electic. Some of the staff are friendly and some appear unhelpful especially with recommendations from the food menu. Seem like they have a lot of staff but it is still difficult to get their attention at times..At times I am not sure if this was meant to be a fine dining restaurant or for casual dining..
5
Thank you Punjab Grill for making feel us special at the restaurant....
The food by Chef Javed & service by Mr. Ramesh was excellent...thanks for such a hospitality...
I will surely recommend everyone to Punjab Grill...
Cheers....

I booked the table in advance after seeing it on the website.
Indian Food with very high standard with very generous portions and unusual twist.
Beautiful grilled meat, the service is exceptional.
5
Service is fabulous!!! Very attentive and even made us something not on the menu. I have nothing to complain about the food at all!!
5
Ive been told that this restaurant might be the best in town and i now can confirm that it is the best indian i have been to so far. Staff were helpful and always available. Food was great and service and location are perfect
5
Had the best moth watering bubble lassi new dish(starter) and the awesome starter platter in the heart of MBS ...5 star location with nice chill ambience
5
One of the finest place to dine in Singapore. With Wonderful Indian food which will enhance your palate, once you enter n you won't go anywhere for indian food in Singapore it's soo fantastic for dining for lunch as well as dinner with multiple choice in menu as well as the service of the food n acknowledgement about the to guest is awesome
4
My experience was awesome and had a great time with my family indulging into mouth watering desi food with whole lot of twists...My Favourite is ghost dum Ki biryani which was cook to perfection. I am Soo tempted to go back again with my family. We had different Kind of food from Tandoori jheenga ,salmon tikka,chaat,kebabs platter and kulfi.It's authentic but it have great twist to it.. they have kept in mind how to carter to people who enjoys good Indian food... it's a home away from home.. It's a comfy friendly environment to dine in and staff are helpful as well

One of THE... best restaurant for Indian cuisine. Attractive ambiance for couples and family.. Fabulous service & presentation of dishes .. I have visited with my friends for lunch, Food was really delicious and gourmet.. Never had Dal makhani butter chicken Paneer & coffee just like that .. very very testy.. at last complimentary PAN shot was really add on to delicious food..Luckily I got a chance to interact with MANAGER Ramesh & awarded CHEF Jawed .. that interaction & thoughts proves their perfection in service & quality.
1
So this place was recommended to me for the indian food. Thought i would try it as it came highly recommended by a follow punjabi.food was just so watered down with cream and so far from what you would expect from North india - i would avoid this place if you want real indian food.
5
Went there for an anniversary dinner and had a real good time. The food is excellent and lots of options to go with (both veg and non-veg). The prices, as expected, are on the higher side in line with other fine dining restaurants. Please make sure to reserve in advance as this place is always in demand
5
We are regular visitors to Punjab grill and every time the food has been excellent and the service amazing. This is a must visit place for anyone who is a fan of awesome Indian food.
4
Good food. A bit pricey as expected, but nice dinner preparation. Specially after a long walk in and around the place.
4
They can make tea... so no Chai here. however when we gave them feedback they didn't charge for it
Food was good, menu was great and servings were big
Staff was friendly
5
What a little gem in Singapore. Wonderful service and fantastic food. Big serves! Will definitely be back and highly recommend!
5
Great food. One of the best Indian food that I have had in a long time. The quality of food and service is high. The only down-side is when we came to claim the Entertainer voucher, where we met with resistance. However, it was resolved.
4
The food was excellent, very unique style and presentation and taste than commonly available Indian food but is damn expensive. Ambiance is wonderful and great service
2
IMHO -The food was average at best. I really expected something authentic but the chicken dish I ordered tasted like cooked (un-marinated) chicken thrown into a sauce. The restaurant tables are way too small - to small to take dishes, so ones food is kept on a tray a few meters away. Consequently you cant continue eating without begging for a waiter to serve you. The waiters are racing about at full speed which makes the whole seen one of Non-relaxation. On the other hand perhaps I expected too much from a restaurant in a shopping center. It is quite expensive too. Murgh Makhani usd32.5 .. Daal usd27.60 .. Jeera rice usd14.60. Note 17% is added to the bill for service n tax

I never got a chance to visit Punjab Grill in the past. It's located in one of the prime locations in the world - Marina Bay Sands. I am a vegetarian and that too selective in vegetarian options. So the weekday buffet menu doesn't have many items of my choice/preference. So I chose to visit it on Sunday, which has weekend special menus. I opted for Kababs and Biryani Veg menu option, both are my favorites.The service is very good, kind spoken people and offers help in every way possible. The serving was very good with good looking stylish cutlery. It started with onion and potato mash starter and then continued with Kababs - Baingan, Onion/Broccoli/Pumpkin, Paneer. I was expecting more of kebabs with more exciting choices, but that was the end of kebabs. Then there was a veg curry and dal makhani with a basket full of rotis/naans. There were two options for biryanis and they served both and they tasted good. The desserts weren't that great and we skipped them and it ended well with paan shot (liquid paan). Overall it's good but it seemed pricey for the quantity of kebabs and desserts could have been better
5
i must say this was the best indian restaurant i have been to in Singapore. the staff are amazing and the food is out of this world.the starters of golgappa platter was amazing and along with the Paneer Tikka.Mains of daal and curry was simply delicious and full marks to the chef.it has a numerous whiskeys to have and cocktails.the staff were excellent and special mention to Sachin (i believe this was his name - apologies if not!), who was great and recommended a few items to try.definatly go to this if you like indian food
4
It is one of the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. The ambience is very grand and the service is superb. All the food was amazing. Chaat and gol gappa platter are a must try. We were also served bite sized cheese balls which was on the house by their head chef
4
Excellent service with food served in your plate by the waiters. Lovely little touches like palate cleansers.
Our mixed grill was lovely. Unfortunately our lamb sagwala had very firm lamb in it. The Dahl and chicken makhani were lovely.
4
Went there with friend. The food and service was excellent. However I think the food was too costly! $45 for a curry is too steep! There are other Indian restaurants in Singapore serving quality food for 1/4 the price!
4
Service and food was very good. They had few entree surprises on-the-house. On request, restaurant provided fruits for the kid, on-the-house again. Hospitality was very nice and service was reasonably quick. Depending on the crowd, you may experience high decibel !
5
One of my favourite Indian restaurants in Singapore. Food is amazing, loved the ambience. Would highly recommend if you wish to have great Indian food.
5
Great decor, beautifully plated dishes and delicious food. Would highly recommend ordering the chicken tikka masala, lamb chops, and Amritsari fish.
5
Located in MBS...... After tiring trip from KL and a delayed early morning flight, We were longing to have good food and popped in to PG. Welcomed professionally and pampered warmingly was a great way to start. Dishes were awesome and succulent. Chefs signature greeting dish cheese balls was .... pls try it.VFM is - not bad spending tat xtra dollars for a good food when away from home in elegantly decorated restaurant in a fitting space.And for the spirits lovers you will not be disappointed with the collection...With Love.Bon Appetit
5
The food was very delicious, and the presentation is well thought of. The service is high quality and friendly. Of course, there is a price for all this, so prices are high, and the clients around you are well off, so better to be well dressed not to feel out of place.They offer Halal food, but also provide alcohol if the client would like to enjoy
4
Stumbled upon this restaurant two years ago, and since then, it's one of our choice whenever we need to attend event at MBS. The executive lunch set is awesome, portion is just right (not too much) and great variety. You get to taste a wide assortment of Punjab cuisine.
4
Expensive Indian food and drinks. We had all parantha, lamb curry, chicken dish, garlic nans and saffron rice, 2 ginger ales and one whisky came to over Â£150!! It was really OK had much better in London a lot cheaper. Service was excellent and we were given two starters to taste just a spoonful on the house, both were good and presented well.
4
Visited this place couple of times in last month. Both times tried the set lunch. Though items taste good but very heavy, they use too much of dry fruit in spices. Both the times curries taste the same, you'll be easily bored after having food 2-3 times.Suggestion- They need to repeat starters
5
What better to get a punjabi sumptuous meal at a platelike singapore, a home cooked meal away from home, tried our hands on veg.handi biryani, which must appreciate is an awesome delicacy, for more dishes, try your own self.
5
Friend and I went to have dinner during my last visit to Singapore and felt it's like a heaven with choice of great food selection and the service is impeccable ..
Worth to visit again ..
4
Very good food and selection, serving size was just right. Ambience is good. Bar Service needs to be better - very slow.
5
Been her on two occasions for their lunch and dinner set menu. Both times have left me drooling wanting more. Besides every dish packed with flavor, amazingly crafted set menus, the service is superb from the staff. Definitely up there as one of my favourite Indian restaurants
5
I and my friends visited this place for the Sunday Lunch Buffet (Kebab and Biryani feast set menu). Although the price for this was at a little higher end, but we went back totally satisfied and happy with the experience :) This is well placed in one corner of the MBS, the interior deco and ambience was lovely! The food had 4 varieties of starters, 3 main course dishes (biryani, daal, prawns masala) and mini platter of desserts.The service was excellently good and prompt. We were specially impressed by Mr. Sachin who was very courteous, attentive and the best part - he got us a complimentary cake as it was my farewell lunch...and also wished me luck for my trip back :))Kebabs, biryani, jal jeera drink ..everything was very high quality and delicious..non-greasy and perfectly cooked.Highly recommend this place....worth a visit...absolutely happy to have tried it :
5
We live in London and so are exposed to lots of good Indian restaurants some of which are Michelin star (don't think they should have them as food was mediocre at best.)This place was awesome. Great presentation and great tasting authentic (I'm of Indian origin) food that is definitely worth a visit.Waiters and management made some great suggestions. No hesitation in recommending this restauran
3
We visited this place quite a few times. Once for the weekend brunch which had unlimited kebabs for tasting & twice for dinners. Food quality & ambience are very good considering the fact that its a chain from Jiggs Kalra. Sheekh kebab,biriyani, chicken tikka are some of the favourites. I also recommend one to try red lentil (dhall makani). The food is of high quality. We were once seated just in front of the kitchen (the centre table) from where we could view the making of kebabs, rotis & naans. We also spotted one of the chefs picking up a sheekh kebab from the oven when few of the pieces fell down and the chef still picked them and placed them on the serving plate. Perhaps they dint fall on the floor or may be they did. The drinks are over priced. Service is quite nice. Reservations recommended if you are planning to visit on a weekday.
4
Poor location, almost hidden, at the low-traffic end of the MBS mall. Surprisingly, it is one of the better Indian restaurants in Singapore! Mostly well-known North-west Indian dishes (and a few unusual ones as well), but prepared with extreme refinement and bursting in complex flavours. The amuse-bouches and liquid mignardises are yummy. Excellent service, although the staff may be overwhelmed when it is crowded on weekend evenings. Pricier than average, but still reasonable compared to its Japanese, Chinese or European counterparts
5
Punjab Grill for me is an excellent dining experience whether you have a business meeting or a birthday they manage to keep you happy and your food up to high standards. As well as the impressive service. I had already visited Singapore and one of the kind waiters their managed to remember the exact order I ordered last year. Whether drinks or food you like are not available they still manage to fulfill your demands.
5
Hey been to this hotel to spent our anniversary. Wonderful ambience nice food and best in class services at Singapore. If you are roaming near marina bay you must try this hotel and the best part of this hotel is that they give pan shots at the end. So must try
5
Awesome food ! Beautiful ambience and excellent service ! The quality of the food is excellent . Will definitely recommend it to my friends !
4
Good food. Good presentation and attentive service. A little slow but the place got busy after we entered. The tandoori chicken and the malai chicken were very well done. The sarson ka saag was superb - tasty and light.
3
Food is good for family or friends.. drinks was good too, worth travelling down, but if you're driving will depends for carpark charges.
5
This place has some excellent Indian food. After having all sorts of cuisine for 5 days, its heaven to have such great food !!!
4
Restaurant is located at possibly best location in Singapore (Marina Bay). Food is really yummy and true Indian flavor.
4
Excellent food, good service, nice ambience. A must visit if you are hungry and looking for some North Indian food while shopping...
5
I was in Marina Bay Sands with my friends they told me we want to have Indian food so I took them to punjab grill. The food served here is very nice and very attentive service. Tandoori lobster is something very fusion and salmon tikka my friends liked a lot. Mains were also very nice signature dish murgh makhni very authentic and up to the mark.We will be soon back again
2
We came in from Dubai and being from north India , we were delighted to see Punjab grillFirst of all our reservation was not found in system and hostess was horrendous and rudeTo add to our agony, food came in cold and service was worst than a food stall in Chinatown When tried complaining to a senior person, he completely ignored and never even apologizedOverall, paid $400 for probably worst experience of our life.I would highly not recommend this place especially for its service& value for money.Sadly this restaurant brings great shame to culinary scene in Singapore and to great Chef Gill name. I do hope that some training is imparted to staf
5
Restaurant is small and difficult to get seat during busy holiday season. Staff are friendly and highly professional. Indian food served here is really great, tasty and perfect. They offer fixed menu also in which they serve soup, starters, Biryani, Roti and desserts. Very quality and tasty food.
2
You pay big $$$$ to eat here . I say DON'T BOTHER. I was expecting faultless food with incredible sauces and flavours, in a great atmosphere. I even booked it as a our first night dinner as i wanted to be pampered after our long flightWhat we got was a naughty little boy disrupting the entire room at the next table for 2 hours. As it was past his bed time and he was to little to be out in such a establishment. With parents that did not know how to discipline him.Nor did the staff at the restaurant respect the other paying diners and ask this family to move outside to the mall area and leave the more glamorous chandelier indoor area peacefulI did ask if they would move this family but nothing happenedOk food: it arrived cold. Yes cold. So cold that we had to send it back. It did return steaming hot , which is the way it should of come out. The sauces was ok on our fish but nothing specialAs for the tow different rice dishes the were the same white rice one just had peas thrown into it. I've eaten enough Indian to not fall for a con job like this.I was upset that this dinner turned out to be SO ordinary in all ways.I did ask for compensation and was only offered excuses and defensive remakes and 10% off the bill.I say DON'T EAT HEREIf you can go to OSHO Indian restaurant in Victoria on the Mornington peninsula for half the cost of this meal you would have a feast with the most amazing fish curry and saucesAll of the rices are very different and each dish is sublimeAnd the atmosphere is great.Jus t goes to show we travel around the world looking for experiences but bliss in in our own backyard All I got was a bad experience and a expensive bill form Punjab grill
3
Food is ok. I was invited there by a Singapore colleague of mine and we had lunch there. Ambience is good. Staff courteous. Food is nothing special but not bad. Had the power lunch. Costs above SGD 50 per person
3
So I love this place during the weekdays. Fantastic food, the set menu is always great and the service excellent. But during the weekend a totally different story. The service is really bad, there are tables with dirty plates sitting around for an hour, half the staff can't be asked for something because they don't have authority to take orders or understand, and half the food arrives cold. Plus, unless you really like rice, the weekend biryani lunch is just very heavy and pointless. I rave about this place to my wife and friends, about how good it is for my business lunches, but then bring them on the weekend and its horrendous. Half the time yesterday we could barely understand the waiters, and when my guest tried to order a la carte, the waiter kept on insisting that she order from the set menu, even though they give you the a la carte menu and say its all available..
5
The business visit naturally follows with dining with colleagues. And this time the venue was Punjab Grill, an Indian speciality restaurant at iconic Marina Bay Sands complex. Best part is this is a walking distance away from MBFC. So a pleasant evening walk to Sands was a good start. The restaurant - a mid sized property decorated with Indian traditional motifs is a pleasant place to be. Singapore is choke a block with fine dining restaurants serving multitude of cuisines. And with huge Indian population, india restaurants are not so unique in Singapore. This place - no relation of Jiggs Calra inspired Punjab Grills in Mumbai - has really found a place for itself. The food is absolutely fantastic. And to cater to international clientele and myriad pallets, they take care to manage the spices and flavours. The vegetarian platter for self was excellent as always. Friends from Japan and Australia found the tandoori chicken / grilled fish and sea food very appetising. And I being the only vegetarian they did not have to be polite of they did not like the food. And Naan and Kulchas for a wonderful bread basket. I finished the food with Biryani - the rice dish with saffron and kevra aroma was absolutely heavenly. And to desserts - the kulfi and Gulab Jamun - which I enjoyed was found a bit too rich by my non Indian friends. A must visit place for all those who love Indian food. Even for Indians who visit Singapore, this will be a wonderful experience
4
Perfect for fine dining, amazing location, spacious, extravagant interiors, variety on menu card, big portion size, innovative.Mukhwas (mouth freshener) is replaced by Pan shot. Now a days common but it was unique and I had it for the first time here. The welcome snack is served in special cutlery, curvey spoon kind. Menu offers good variety for veggie and non-veggie. Though be aware that the portion size is large so better to order less dishes in one go.Servers are courteous, smiling, make you feel good.Taste: Indian. We love the taste. Excellent Indian vegetarian fine dining place. Whatever we have ordered has been royal and we havenâ€™t been disappointed yet. We visit this restaurant on special occasions or if someone close visit us here
4
As an indian , i was looking for some indian food after spending 5 days in singapore.pumjab grill at Marina bay was just amazing, Great food. Very good service. They never let us over order . Told us the right portions to order. Staff was very courteous and friendly
5
Enjoyed the wide array of dishes with so different but exquisite tastes. The 5-course menu was really too much for our tummies even though we hardly had much of the carbs (rice, naan). Service was excellent and I like the attention that the waiters give in explaining what was being served and how some of them should be eaten
3
What can I say...First: for the food I should give 5*, the drinks i had 3* and for the Ambiente 5* again. Second: for staff 2-3* because some is only there and some are working and only one was friendly and smile sometimes. Third: I didn't felt welcomed and comfortable.After arrival thinking about to pay the first water and change the restaurant. I didn't.The food, I had lamb with naan, was delicious.The seafood platter from my friend was good too, the salmon i tried was excellent. So the kitchen is great. I don't know why, but I felt the staff isn't happy and not working as a team, so the guest also can not feel happy and comfortable there. If you want to try it do it because the food and maybe you will get a friendly staff and an attentive service.But for "just" a good food the price is overdrawn. Spent 192$ and regret it. It shouldn't happens
3
Ok..this is definitely not a value for money restaurant.We were a group of 14 people and decided to go for their vegetarian/ non-vegetarian lunch set which is SGD 58 a piece and therefore had some expectations. Moreover, the restaurant is associated with Jiggs Kalra and we thought why not try.1. It is located in the Marina Bay Sands complex and I think that's why they price everything so high; it's the location; and that's it; nothing else.2. Note that this was reserved 4 days in advance.3. Before ordering, the waiter alerted us that they were having a 'technical' issue and therefore we would need to wait for 30 minutes after order was placed. I thought that was the norm almost everywhere (waiting for 30 minutes) and considered it a non-issue.4. The 'Punjab' grill lunch started with Gujarati khakras; not that i had any problem with it.5. Started with the appetizers ofcourse. They don't come and put everything in front of you. They instead, serve you things one by one; only when you ask. It's kind of unlimited food ( I guess). No problem here. A note - the non-veg starters are better than the veg ones. We finished and waited around 15 minutes for the main course to arrive. The waiter came out from the kitchen and asked if we needed another round of starters. We didn't complain except that it took him quite long for him to ask that question.6. The main course, again, took a hell of a time to arrive. The non veg consisted of dal makhani and prawns curry. Prawns curry was below average. The veg consisted of same dal makhani and veg-kheema; whatever that was. The biryani was alright.7. The desert was mango kulfi; a slice of cheese cake and something else; the name of which I cannot recall. It was not Indian ofcourse.8. Ended with a pan-shot; paan would have been better.9. The BEST PART OF IT ALL - they get something that looks like polo mints and pour hot water over it and announce 'hand towels'. It absorbs water and kind of puff up you may use it for wiping your hands. This was something novel.10. And did I forget to add - they had a fight going on in the kitchen. Even with the glass doors closed, the guests had a fair idea about what was going on. All in all, an easily forgettable experience. Any restaurant in little India would have served the same stuff in less than half the price. We came in primarily hearing Jiggs Kalra's name attached to the restaurant and went back disappointed
4
You do not expect Jiggs Kalra to go wrong with North Indian food and neither does he in this case. Excellent ambience and service. The food is flavorful - not overloaded with spices or oily. Just the right combinations. The butter chicken and the biryani served here are the best in Singapore. I wouldn't rate the vegetarian very highly but the non-veg food is to die for!They serve complementary masala papad and Paan shot. The paan shot was the highlight of our meal (but I have been told they have discontinued it)
4
The food was pretty good. The decor and everything else is also fine and the good service that we found was probably the best in Singapore.The food is not that extra ordinary but you would be happy to dine here ,especially if you are Indian and are done with the pastas and the pizzas.Although a bit expensive. Ended up paying more than a 100 SD for a couple of breads and 2 curries
5
Had an amazing evening at Punjab grill. Delicious food & equally excellent service...
Specially want to highlight Sachin whose hospitality made our evening memorable.
4
superb food. Nice Ambience and great service.
We were even served samples of some of the chef's dishes of the day.
5
Our son loved the view of the tandoors. As a "celebrity chef" restaurant, it was suitably pricey but worth it for the delicious food, knowledgeable, professional staff and the stylish setting.
4
I've had the pleasure of dining in at Punjabi grill at many other locations but the one in Singapore is exceptionally pricey. The food was good.. I'd say the butter chicken was on the sweeter end but will satisfy your taste buds for sure. The dal makhani was excellent!! The service was good. Prior reservation is recommended
2
I have visited the restaurant frequently and have always been a fan of their cooking. However during the last visit the quality of food has deteriorated substantially.For example the lamb rack, chicken kebab all seem to be made from the same marinade. In the first instance the lamb kebabs was overlooked & burnt. Though the manager graciously offered seconds for the overlooked food it left, no pun intended, a bad taste.It seems that most of the grilled food is based on one marinade and overcooked. When we asked for crispy naan it was overcooked also. The biryani meat texture and taste was also below par with very little meat and lots of bone. Good for the dogs but unfortunately we are no more local.The overall quality of the food is disappointingly pedestrian and poor. Recommend it be given a miss if one wants to sample good Indian food in Singapore
3
Visited this restaurant a few times and with every visit I feel their standards drop.Last visit was over the last weekend - food was good (thankfully that hasn't changed) but the environment, ambience, service needs help!The presentation of the food looked like they were simply in a hurry to get the food out of the kitchen with the gravy dripping from the side of the bowls. The drinks were in glasses that hadn't been cleaned at the rim. Yikes.The serving staff too seemed to be distracted and totally not interested!The table cloth was stained.Whilst the food is good, the entire dining experience wasn't very pleasant. For guests/ diners visiting restaurants like Punjab Grill which are relatively expensive and promise a fine dining experience, the expectation is more!My first visit was over an year ago and it was impeccable - they've come a long way since then but unfortunately its been the wrong one
4
This restaurant was recommended to us by a few friends from the UK. After walking for what felt like miles, we found it right on the bottom floor at the end of the mall. The atmosphere in the restaurant was nice as were the staff who were all very friendly. The food itself, i would say was just average, it was nice and I am glad we went but it was just standard. We paid half the price for a similar meal in little india but being a celebrity restaurant it was expected. Overall, nice food and nice place
3
Generally the food is good, however Indian it should be, on the menu is the following - "Norwegian salmon tikka and Tandoori foie gras" I have never seen that on a menu in any restaurant in India, my advice, if you really want true Indian food they opt for "Little India" another point true Indian restaurants do not serve wine either, what we have here is "Fusion" which is fine but please let us eat the true food of India
3
A group of friends went for dinner a short while back, with our families with a few kids in their early teens. The service was very good, and we were attended to very well by their staff. The ambiance was modern and pleasant. The standout was a potato-based appetiser on a spoon that they served, and the little drama that we experienced when they gave us compressed towlettes that grew and came to life when warm water was poured on them. The disappointment however was the food vs cost. The food was ok!!. I really enjoyed the Tamatar Dhanya Soup, and the crispies we were served. We ordered a mixture of Naan & Parata's, with Dhal and a few other curries. None really stood out... all were OK. We are vegetarians, so it maybe that their strengths was in the meat dishes, hence the experience was less than I had hoped for. I have had their Kulfi the last time. Which was heavenly, but this time we gave it a miss. Overall for vegetarians at the Marina Bay Sands, there is little choices; this and Pita-Pan (Mediterranean food) only, though Pita-Pan is only vegetarian food which is a plus, but its more a cafe-like than a proper-restaurant
5
This place serves the best kebabs in Singapore. Being part of a set meal, we feel complete with the normal fare coupled with desserts and a drink. I found this satisfying amidst a stylish atmosphere for a reasonable price. The staff are attentive and ready to serve. The food is good quality compared with the kebabs I've tried in India
5
We really enjoy dining at Punjab Grill (it was not our first time there). The quality of the food is great. Especially the curries as main course are excellent. The service was great as well. We enjoyed the evening there.
5
The best indian food restaurant. I can say I have visited so many countries but the best Indian food plus service I have got here only.
5
Our group of 15 went to celebrate a birthday, and we couldn't have chosen a better venue. Weekend set menu was excellent (lots of variety in both the veg and non-veg sets, outstanding quality, huge portions, piping hot food, fresh produce, super yummy) and great value for money. Service was impeccable, a real feat considering our group size and some fussy people. They kindly gave us a complimentary birthday cake which was so sweet of them - and were very accommodating in storing the cake we had brought with us with no questions asked. Overall a perfect experience- we had a lovely lunch and a great birthday celebration, and are counting down to returning asap.

Went to the Punjab Grill for lunch and had the Power Set lunch. I was impressed with the restaurant and the way the food was served. Food was not spicy which made me very happy. I don't enjoy too hot a curry. The appetizers were appealing, the ginger/lime juice went great with the food. Then came a little sorbet to whet your appetite before the mains were serve.All in all, I was a happy and satisfied customer
5
The restaurant is very opulent, the staff super attentive & the decor very simple & elegant.The food was sublime, we shared a platter of starters & had the chefs special. After much wine & Singapore slings during our stay in the city it was nice to have an excuse to drink a beer!Compared the prices in the UK it would be considered very expensive but it was definitely worth every penny.I would highly recommend a trip to this jewel
5
I have been wanting to go here for a while. I wasn't disappointed.The menu is extensive & not your typical menu. Yes, the price is more than other options, but the menu, the premises, the service & the quality of the food make this well worth it. I will certainly be back

If you are feeling particularly hungry and in the mood for a sumptuous Indian meal then Punjab Grill is a good choice and the set lunch is a particularly good deal.I'm not a huge fan of restaurants set in a shopping mall, but MBS is Singapore's premier mall and Punjab Grill is conveniently situated at one end of the mall so it doesn't really detract from the ambience.The set meal comes with a long plate of several starts and each item was thoroughly delicious. Although each item looks small, don't forget that Indian food is rich and heavy so you're going to be hitting a wall soon!The main items are the biryani - so much better than the briyani that you get in Singapore which is essentially a South Indian dish. There's an excellent black daal too plus rotis.I notice that they've cut down on the desserts. They now give you three as opposed to the choice of several from a trolley last year. At the very end they give you pan shot. I have a really soft spot for that and I could do with a larger cup of that.The one slightly criticism I had of the restaurant was that the service was a bit slow. I don't mind waiting for the food to come but there were times when they took a long time to clear my table. I thought that a restaurant of this calibre could use a captain who was in overall charge of the service staff and could offer more recommedations to patrons

We went there for dinner on weekend and we opted siting inside but one can sit outside too. The food is really authentic Indian so if you wish to have Indian food yes the place it is ! Every food item they were serving especially the starters and even the complimentary ones were garnished well and that really reflected how they keep their customers happy. Only thing we found was a bit slow service but being a weekend it didn't matter much to us. The vegetarian options were many and delicious too. They served mango chutney too which really will make you miss your grandma's home if you are from India :) Overall a fine place to dine in

Located in Marina Sands Bay.The food was good and well prepared.We ordered one Paneer dish and Daal Makhni with kulchas and bread basket. We were served complimentary starters with really good chutneys.Restaurant staff are very friendly and always check whether food was tasty.Be aware of a long queue or waiting time,ours was 1 hour. We booked and then roam around Marina Bay and then back to have our dinner.It's pricey but location & quantity wise worth
5
While I was on a business trip and munching on all the Singapore n Chinese food, I truly missed the Indian food and flavours, however when I landed at this place I felt so much like my home...the ethnicity in ambienece and the aroma of the food was just amazing...I was totally impressed seeing this place as it was the only Indian food place in the entire mall-was very proud to see that. Mouth watering food and great sense of taste...Highly recommended!!
5
I have been to Punjab Grill on my wedding anniversary, it was indeed a great choice. Authenticity of food in Punjab Grill is bang on, I found the service really good. This is surely a must dine-in place.
3
Nothing went wrong the food was good and serviced matched but nothing maid me go wow. Was a little expensive which also was a dampener.
4
As usual, you cannot mistake in choosing Punjab Grill as it dishes out the most authentic Indian Food in Singapore. Tadke wala Raita is a great innovation with Non Veg and Veg made to perfection. Recommend to connoisseurs of good food.

Its a nice place to have indian food in marina bay sands. Good to try the chicken dishes. Conveniently located near marina bay sands and is easily accessible via MRT.
5
We had weekend lunch set meal in Punjab grills and found it awesome. Stars of the set meal were paneer tikka and daal makhani. Each menu item in our meal tasted little different, but in nicer side.Punjab grills is an expensive restaurant, but defiantly worth it. Order set meal to have variety, if you are going as couple
5
Elegantly presented Indian food with a glass walked random area at the rear of the restaurant. The food is beautifully presented and offers q wide choice of traditional and new Indian dishes. It's pricy but worth it. Book indoors rather than outdoors otherwise it's more like dining in a food court. Their lassi is very good and they have the best mango chutney in Singapore. The masala tea is a great finish.
5
I visited on Valentine' day with my lovely wife its was a great dining experience I had in my life. wow food was awesome my wife still missing that food. I had soup and kebab Chicken tikka , Hokkaido scallop. As well as we had grill fish with curry & meat Punjab grill that was so yummy and ya of course I will never ever forget abt ur desserts @ rasmalai stuffed with dates and figs. I would like to thank you chef to Made our Valentine day so spacial. Definitely we will visit again with our family. Thank you & Best Regards

The restaurant, which prides itself to be one of the premium Indian fine dining options in Singapore, was a big let down !!1. The restaurant itself was stinking of mould and dampness. 2. The pappads served were soggy and not at all crisp - we had to ask for fresh ones. 3. We ordered bhindi masaledar - it was undercooked and had no salt. We had to send it back and they 'recooked' it to make it edible. 4. The butter chicken and malai kofta were ordinary. For the price that it charges, the experience was simply pathetic !!! Would be the last place I would recommend to anyone looking for Indian food in Singapore. In the last two years, the place has run down considerably, and if this continues, I can foresee that it will not be long before it downs its shutters here, which will be sad !
5
Recently visited them for my wife's birthday for lunch, and tried the 5 course degustation menu (came to about SGD 240 for 2- a bit steep, but worth it!) Every single item from starters and soup to main course and dessert was tasty. Really good stuff. The service was also really good. Only improvement area was that they should space out each course a bit more. When I happened to mention it was my wife's birthday the main in charge also got out a small cake with a candle- that was nice.Overall, an excellent dining experience, and we will surely come for lunch again in future
2
For Indians , the food served at Punjab grill would taste bland as it is more targeted towards other foreign nationals.Tried veg dishes like Veg platter , Dal makhni , Malai kofta but is way way too mediocre for Indian taste buds. Even the desertt (Phirni with gulab jamun) was mildly sweet.Service was good and full credit to the the team there.I would not go here again as you can get much better Indian food in SGP at half the price
4
Punjab Grill is an Indian chain - run by a celebrity chef...and does not fail to tingle the taste buds to the maximum....they have all the delicacies and specialities...and is typically not very crowded...
5
Really enjoyed feast lunch and tasty food. Restaurant staff are very friendly and always check whether food was tasty or needed any topup always.
Like Pan liquid and Desert
3
I was expecting reasonable cost, could be little higher than normal Indian Restaurants, but this restaurant is terribly higher cost ! May be due to location.
3
The food is generally good and well prepared. In singapore this stands out as a good place for indian food. Having said that, a foodie looking for the taste of india may have better luck exploring little India.The Degustation platter started off well with the Golgappa and the Kebab, things were just as interesting with the Tomato soup, if i may say so the soup was rather delicious. The Started platter has a hit had a miss, the broccoli was rather odd as a choice of combination.The Paneer on the main was rather blant and tangy the dal was promising. The Menu said assortment of bread but only one variety was served.The Desert says grilled desert, but what came was a four different and unrelated in taste offering, the mango kulfi was good, however the rose moose with a bitter cake was a as confusing on the pallet as it was on the eyes.The total bill for one person would lighten you by over $100 (Singapore) and you feel full but rather let down
4
Located in Marina Sands Bay, our expectations were of an over-priced pretentious Indian. But we couldn't have been more wrong. By far our best meal in Singapore, unpretentious and reasonably priced. OK, it is located in a Mall but that didn't detracted from the incredible house chicken specialty and tandoori broccoli, and a waiter who correctly advised us to order less (which must be a first!)
5
If I were to be completely honest, this restaurant has the best Indian food I have ever eaten in a restaurant. But this only based on the things that I ordered. Firstly, the service at Punjab Grill is A1. The concept of the waiter serving out the food and constantly checking on the customer is exceptional. I ordered the Ranauqeen Seekhan, Bhatti Da Murg Pindiwala and the Murg Tikka Punjab Grill. The Ranauqeen Seekhan was easily the best seekh kebab I have ever eaten in my life. It was cooked so perfectly and just tasted exceptional. The Bhatti Da Murg Pindiwala was quite good too but wasn't as great as the Murg Tikka Punjab Grill. That was done so well and tasted unlike any other standard Indian restaurant. The mains were Murg Makhani and the Meet Punjab Grill. The Meet Punjab Grill tasted really nice but the Murg Makhani really stole the show. I've never eaten such a great bitter chicken at a restaurant ever. It tasted so authentic and had the right amount of everything in it. It wasn't overpowering in the sweetness department like most Indian restaurant. I've never been impressed this much by Indian restaurant food ever. When I think about it, I think the price of the dish is worth it since it's much more than food ; it's art. I would recommend anyone that is going to Singapore that is willing to pay lots of money for exceptional Indian food to go to Punjab Grill. It's important to note that this is the place you go to not for street food but mainly things from the tandoor

Dear friends wherever you stay in Singapore I would recommend to visit Punjab Grill for its mouth watering delicacies and starters and you can also have a glimpse of the Marina Bay Sands the most appreciated destination in Hotels as on date in Singapore. Don't miss to have a candle light dinner here and have a great memory too :
5
We were staying at the marina bay sands. Too tired to go and eat outside the hotel. Belonging to a punjabi family, dad wanted to eat north indian food. Great Experience. We were served complimentary starters with really good chutneys.. were different from the ones we usually make at home. We also got cauliflower tikka on real cute forks.. followed a good cooked paneer, tandoori roti, daal. Before we left we were served a pan drink.. never had it before.. was interesting.. so in general was a good experience.. did not have to waste time and money to go and eat outside the marina bay sands.
5
We are used to both cooking and eating Indian food att restaurants back home in Sweden and this was a top- end eating experience. Situated in one of the newest malls in Singapore we first thought this was a bit "special" but after been seated right by the tandorchef that performed fantastic during the whole evening. handling 3 parallell ovens at the same time- awesome! We ate. Palak Panir, Lamb curry and 3 grilled dishes. They where all fantastic. The best Indian eating experience we have had ever
5
Punjab Grill Singapore is by far the best indian dining space in Singapore. We went there for our anniversary meal during our recent trip to Singapore and I was blown away from the array of beautiful articulated plates and orchestratic service . The staff made sure I received appropriate attention and privacy. The chef personalized my dishes. I loved my experience yet again in Punjab Grill and will recommend it everyone. Thank you team PGS and Master Chef Javed for your Excellent hospitality.With love from Abu Dhab

The service of hotel is good. The food was lacking taste .We ordered breads,starter and paneer vegetable. The food was lacking taste . One thing which was good was the pann sharbat they gave in the end.
5
We've been to this restaurant a number of times and have always enjoyed the food. Don't miss out on the paan shot towards the end of the meal.

Best Indian Food in Singapore.Superb presentation coupled with fingure licking taste.....Perfect example of Indian Mehmaan Nawazi..

Made a reservation for 9PM in the evening and reached the reception desk at 9PM sharp only to find nobody attending there. The waiting staff was going in and out of the restaurant totally ignoring the bystanders waiting to be escorted to their tables. After 10 minutes of confusion and agony, we decided to just walk into the restaurant and see if we catch somone's attention. Luckily it worked and we were escorted to a table after 3 more minutes of waiting. They have tried to present a fancy ambiance which feels a bit half-hearted due to all that dust on the glass surfaces and all that noise.Putting all that aside, we ordered one vegetarian and one non-vegetarian degustation menu as we wanted to try out some variety without getting overstuffed. I had the vegetarian one so can only talk about that. The amuse-bouche was a tiny aloo tikki and a below average quality paani puri. Such food on random street stalls in India tastes much better and much fresher than it did here. Still hoping for the menu to get better by the course after a long wait arrived an ill-presented flavourless salty tomato soup. After this point the slow service of courses became excruciating. Then came the apperizers: paneer tikka, spiced broccoli and yogurt kebab and everything but the broccoli tasted really stale. From this point onwards, a feeling of guilt on wasting so much time, so many calories and so much money on such bad food began to overpower the senses. The slow service made me feel trapped at the dinner table, the kind of feeling I have never had at a restaurant. Then came the main course. First, a full portion (Considering it was a degustation menu) of stale vegetable biryani followed by 2 big bowls of dal makhani and some paneer dish, and a naan, enough to feed 2 people for a meal. The main course minus the biryani tasted okayish, definitely not worth the price tag. The big main course portion added another guilt to the list - Wasting so much food. At this point, I was relieved that there's only the dessert course left and we can get out of here as soon as that's done. That is precisely what we did as soon as the dessert arrived - paan ice-cream, chocolate brownie, fig pudding. The dessert was okay, no complaints there, probably the best of all the five courses.Overall, my advice to anyone reading this review is please spare yourself the pain and guilt of eating at this place. You'll be better off exploring one of the many other remarkably good Indian eateries dotted around Singapore

We reserved this place for 9pm and were there at 8:58pm sharp. After being ignored for 15 minutes at the entrance, we tried to walk in and see if they notice us which is when we got our table.We ordered a 5 course veg and a 5 course non veg degustation menu. We were very excited to visit this place but the ambience appeared bit disappointing. It seems they haven't cleaned the glasses for ages.Our disappointment reached another level when food started coming in. I think we made a big mistake coming here given that there are other good indian restaurants around here in Singapore. The only thing we liked was the sorbet after starters which was supposed to clear your throat. Not to mention their service is way too slow to be acceptable. If you have made this far reading this review, I really hope that if you go there you really know what you are wasting your money, time and calories on

Excellent Place to visit. We ordered a chef's degustation menu which I suppose is on the A Lister's for the people who visit this place. The staff is very courteous special the Manager Mr. Ramesh Somani. Overall ambiance was good. I personally like Indian Ocean, so the songs played were all very nice. The service can be improved on for the chef's degustation menu as I noticed that for Ã€ la carte is was quick. All n all a great experienc

We ordered a chef's degustation menu ($98 ++). It started with a Papri chaat which was good. Then came the tamatar shorba which was thick and delicious. Appetizers for veg option, were dahi ke kebab, paneer tikka and brocolli (1 each).Main course had their signature black dal, paneer lababdar and mixed veg. The food was quite delicious all the way through and the portion sizes were actually too much a single person. They can work on their degustation menu to keep it 'lighter' !Dessert platter had a pan kulfi, mousse cake, brownie, walnut cake (i guess) - and despite being full, we ate them happily.Overall the dinner was top class in terms of taste and portion size. The service was slow though, and it took us 2 hours from start to finish. Well worth a visit for authentic indian fine dining
5
Restaurant had a Christmas menu that included turkey biryani, chef's special sorbet, turkey goose liver patty, pan seared masala foie gras, tandoori turkey tikka, and turkey tikka lababdar - just to name a few. Dessert choices were excellent as well - paan kulfi and X-Mas pudding with vanilla and rum raisin. Undoubtedly one of the best course meals I've had in Singapore till date. Service was excellent, as always. Highly recommend this place to all my non-Indian friends wanting to try authentic Indian food in Singapore.
5
Had been here with friends and must say the food could be ranked as one of the best in Singapore. Was fresh,succulent well cooked and spiced sufficiently. Special mention to try the desert of paan kulfi and parle-G brownie which reminds you of India. Service was up to the mark and staff was very friendly
5
Went with my sister during conference in Singapore and decided to go for the 98 dollar per head degustation menu - the best indian food In a long time and worth the price with multiple entrees, unlimited 3 main courses and a variety of deserts to top it off. So much top quality food with excellent service to top it off, the latter a rarity in most Indian restaurant
1
Extremely overpriced for very ordinary food .. Good service but definitely not
worth the money! Would not recommend it..
3
I used to eat here frequently and the service was great but it was a bit distracted yesterday. Food is great but for the amount you're paying you could always just go to Jaggi's and serve yourself faster
4
Service was good, we order what we always order at Indian restaurants. Great flavor bur extremely hot. ,i guess I haven't been eating the right indian food back home.
5
A must visit for all Indian families. The food is simply fantastic and value for money. The vegetarian options are really good
5
Great service. Been to this restaurant lots of times before, but am always excited to try out new things every time I go! Love this place - my favourite Indian restaurant in Singapore, without a doubt. Complete value for money.
5
Not sure I have had better Indian food in Singapore. Love coming to this restaurant, The portions are good size the flavors leave your mouth watering for more. The service is excellent.
5
let me begin by saying that we asked them to open branches in indian cities so that we could relive the experience of dining there - candle light, amazing taste of every dish that we had, extremely attentive staff waiting on us ... and to top it all, a most divine 'paan' sho
3
Came here for lunch .Pros: 1) Attentive staff 2) Quick serviceCons: 1)Quality of Indian food is just average 2) Really expensive ( Paid 155 Singapore dollar for a plate of butter chicken, black dal & a few naans!)Overall, the food lets you down big time

The dashing and dynamic Travelling Gourmet TM goes to "The Surfboard" aka...MARINA Bay Sands but not to gamble at the Casino...I had better things in mind like tasting delectable North Western Indian cuisine. Yummie food was the only thing on my mind...so I made a beeline for the Punjab Grill. This fine dining restaurant appeals to connoisseurs of gourmet Indian food. The decor is warm and romantically lit and at one end is a glass encased Show Kitchen where you can scrutinise the Chefs busily cooking up a typhoon! Hypnotic Indian Sitar music plays in the background...Punjab means "Land of five rivers" and cuisine from this region offers many rich, delicious and varied options. One example is Masala which is a Punjabi dish of onion, garlic and ginger. Much of the food was designed to meet the demands of the traditional Punjabi lifestyle, with high calorie count foods to support rural workers. A renowned Punjabi speciality is Tandoori, especially with non-vegetarian dishes like chicken, lamb and seafood. The meats are cooked or broiled in a special clay oven known as...the Tandoor! The affable manager, Ramesh Somani, brought me to my table. Chef Javed Ahamad told me with a happy grin, "Try my Degustation Menu and Foie gras! I have cut down the oil in my cuisine by 90%, and sometimes I use Avocado oil." Soon the delightful dishes came...A cute soup is the Cappuccino which is served in a cappuccino cup. The Cappuccino Chicken and Almond Sorba is superb! On the end palate the soothing flavour of Cinnamon.Food of the Maharajahs!Foie gras on a mini Naan topped with Chutney was served on a rectangular Revol plate with Sola steelware. OMG! The delectable dish looked at me as if to say "taste me!" So I did...Rich, decadent umami flavours seduced my palate and taste buds...it was heavenly! In between course, sweet-sour Green Mango to cleanse your palate...Tender chunks of boneless fragrant Chicken Dum Briyani with aromatic Saffron spiked long grain Basmati Rice is so very satisfying! Unlike Jasmine rice, Basmati rice is the only rice that does not cause a rapid spike in Blood Sugar, that it, it has a low Glycaemic Index, and is therefore a healthy carbohydrate. Classic Dhal or Lentil Curry is also very tasty. How about a big Tandoori Prawn..full of delicious perfumed flavours but not overly spicy.The Scallops are super yummie! Crispy potato skin and tender and moist inside on a bed of green Asparagus. Accompanied by Tandoori spiced Cardomom Salmon. This dish is an example of creative Mod-Ind cuisine (Modern Indian).To accompany your meal they also have hand crafted Cocktails made with different types of Dilmah Tea. Most refreshing is the shocking red Chamomile Sling which is inspired by the Raffles Hotel's Singapore Sling. It is shaken up freshly with Chamomile Flowre Tea, fresh Pineapple Juice, Grenadine Syrup, Orange juice and topped up with Italian Prosecco Sparkling Wine! The Royal POM & Berries Special Chai is also a winner with Pomegranate and Berries Ta, Fresh Berries Juice, Pineapple and Pomegranate Juice and Vodka!Glorious Naan!The piping hot Butter and Garlic Naan and the ueber-creamy Cheese Naan chock full of molten cheese, as well as the Cheese & Onion Naan are so very yummy! They are crispy outside ...but fluffy-soft and moist and tender inside...like the hot lips of a beautiful and voluptuous woman. The morsels are so good, especially when dipped into luscious and sexy Murgh Makhani or Butter Chicken...then popped into your eager mouth to pleasure your taste buds..Finish your meal with some sweet Indian Temptations like Gulab Jamun and more...Sexy Lychee and Cream Milk Dessert, Chocolate Praline Cake and Kulfi Saffron and Pistachio Ice Cream...The friendly and courteous service is also very attentive without being obtrusive.Arguably, Singapore's best Indian restaurant for North Indian Haute Cusine. I love the food here! Enjoy! :-) Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet is a celebrated Travel, Food and Wine Writer

The food was par excellence but the ambience can be much better for a restaurant that charges around 200 for a basic 2 dish 1 starter meal. With plates clacking right at the bar at both sides of the restaurant we were greeted with a disgusting smell from the used plates at the bar. With some air freshener skills the staff responded and saved the situation. From there on the experience was very nice since we got started on the food. Which is was very very good with a good service
5
Very friendly staff with first class food in an excellent surroundings. When we're back in Singapore will be back to this restaurant.
Punjab Grill was recommended by a friend prior to our visit to Singapore for the F1 GP and a great recommendation.
4
Never disappointed in any visit for great taste and good service. Menu selections are good combination of non vegetarian and vegetarian dishes with highlight on signature dishes.The decor is warm and inviting as always.
4
The staff were exteremky accomadating, we were a large group out to celebrate and made the night extremely memorable. The lamb briyani and naan were very good and the tandoori prawns are a must try. Definitely worth a visit.
3
As a family we were planning to eat out in an authentic Indian restaurant. Overall were quite pleased with the food, the starters were great but the main course and dessert were average.
4
The chef prepared a wonderful menu for restaurant week! The appetizers, mains were amazing! I was not a big fan of the deserts, it was not my type of deserts but everything was prepared really well.The service was mixed, there was one guy (who appeared to be manager or lead server) and he was awesome, always checking on us and ensuring everything was going well. There was another server, young man who was checking in on us but it was clearly because he was told to, he was not genuine at all. I was asking him a question about one of the dishes and he explained as he was walking away form the table! I couldn't even get upset as it was just hilarious to me how unprofessional he was...he clearly either doesn't like his job was maybe just was having a bad day.Overall, we really liked the food here and will go back again for sure

Punjab Grill at Marina Bay Sands Convention Centre, Singapore is an upscale Indian restaurant. We settled for vegetarian fare - Kebabs & Paneer for starter and Pindi Chana, Kofta & Jeera Aloo and Roti basket for the main course. The food was lip smacking. We found it better than the one we had at their Juhu, Mumbai outlet 
1
I have made a reservation for my 5 guests for a Lunch on Monday and i got a call on Monday morning stating that the restaurant is booked for a private function. I could have planned something else if it were to be informed during my booking rather than at the last minute. Not a great experience
4
A bit expensive but the food and the service makes it all worth. When you enter the restaurant the lovely smell of nice curries comes at you. We had two curries with garlic naan and rise and it was more than enough for two people. The curries were well seasoned but not too spicy.
3
We ordered for Amritsari machchi and found out to be American fast food type fried fish and we returned the fish and asked for a tandoori chicken which was amazing.Later found both fish and chicken were billed, we didn't like this looting from Punjab grill
4
My wife and I had lunch here 3 days ago.We ordered the tandoori Prawns,( Jheenga ) Butter chicken, ( Murgh Makhani ) Basmati rice and Naan bread.Plus a bottle of wine, and it was one of the less expensive ones.The wine here is very pricey, so it blows the bill out a lot.Our Lunch came to $193 Singapore dollars for the 2 of us. I consider that to be very expensive and i can see why the other patrons were all drinking water or non alcoholic drinks.The tandoori prawns had an excellent presentation and flavor. I must admit ir was the best presentation for prawns i had seen this year, and the flavor was outstanding.The Butter Chicken on the other hand had a very bland and unexciting presentation. It was served like a plain bowl of orange stuff, no green garnish on top or effort to impress. The chefs need to think about this presentation of this dish in the future. The Flavor was still very good however, but could have been better.The service was friendly,Overall an enjoyable lunch, but as mentioned, room for improvement
5
great tasting food , good quality tikka and tandori spices without overpowering the meats and fish. vegatables done excellent, really enjoyed the food quality
5
A fresh, elegant and modern interior, nicely dressed cool crowd. Nice to see a well set table with cutlery. The menu has very good grilled options and this is a good place to try them king prawns as they are succulent, well cleaned and good quality. The lamb dishes r also fabulous. Condiments are plentiful and portions are generous. Food with a heart ! So rare in singapore. The mango chutney is fresh and excellent. Despite all this, the thing that stands out the most is the intelligent and "switched on " service. The staff are fully attentive and actual interested in what they do. Impeccable! Highly recommended especially if you are entertaining guest and don't want to be embarrassed by the usual sloppy disinterested service levels in singapore
3
It was my second visit to Punjab Grill after a gap of nearly a year. This time we opted for fixed-menu dinner. Among starters, Lamb chop was very good but Chicken malai tikka was average. The Gol gappa and Tikki were passable. The main course was no different. The butter chicken was nowhere near what we get in India. The dessert was okay. The service was slow and prices high.All in all, the Punjab Grill is much better than other Indian restaurants in Singapore but it isnâ€™t as good as its Indian branches
5
I usually don't eat in restaurants in shopping malls but this place was in the toney Marina Sands shopping mall. Our agent recommended this to us before the trip. The PG is not cheap, it's an upscale Indian restaurant where even at lunch you can rack up some serious damage but I have nothing negative to say about the place. The staff could not have been nicer. Two of had the executive tasting lunch which I think was about $70 a person without alcohol. It was just great from star to finish. I eat a lot of Indian food in the states and these dished had some very sophisticated spicing and presentation. I tend to like my food spicy and the seasoning in many of these dishes was so good they didn't need the heat to be tasty. The service was very attentive.I think this was our best meal in Singapor
4
I have to give it to them for the mouth watering Indian Food with loads of options in the Menu. The service was excellent as well. But too steep when it comes to pricing. Wouldn't have hurt me to pay a little less. But, there is no denying that the food was brilliant
3
A colleague and I were looking for a dinner without having made prior reservations and walked past Punjab Prill. Both not being experts in Indian food we relied on the staff for their recommendations. We had a good and for the Marina Bay Sands complex reasonably priced dinner
4
Few days back I went to Punjab grill to have dinner with my family... It was great experience and worth to spend the money on such tasty as well as authentic food ..We all had papdi chaat,non veg kebab platter, Saag ghosht, naan,rasmalai and cocktails..I am looking forward to dine there again.........
5
We had the 5 course set menu, and had a great time!This menu actually gives you 10+ courses since you get three selections as starter (shrimp, lamb and samon). Also, the main course also consisted of three items. as do the dessert. Everything tastes great! Highly recommended!The restaurant is located in the far western end of the shops, next to Marina Bay Sands.
3
This is my 2nd review of PG... for some time, this has been "the" place where I go to celebrate important events in the family... but of late, the quality has been average (Chanas have been hard, paneer has been indifferent), to the extent that last time, there was a bit of plastic in my kadai paneer dish :( :( :(. The management were apologetic, and replaced it, but, but, but, still did not take it off the bill!!! Given their prices and non-memorable quality of food, I don't see myself returning there..
3
Went to Punjab Grill for a birthday celebration. Great service all the way through from the reservation to the check. Have rated it as an average experience as apart from the service, it just seemed wanting in terms of both ambiance and especially food when compared to other Indian fine dining places such as Yantra. The Tandoori Lobster appetizer though was really good. The main courses were ok, unremarkable really. Would go back if I was in Marina Bay Sands, struck by strong Indian food cravings and someone else was paying.
4
bliss for Indians. slightly overpriced. But only good place around Marina Bay.
Suggestion - please keep tag of timings - restaurant people are really strict about the timing - SAD part
4
Very good service and food, i loved the place, there are special dishes that are really tasty starting from the mushroom and cheese appetizers and rice in addition tp the yoghurt

Definately a classy restaurant. Food was indeed very good and quite authentic, although there wee subtle touches towards fusion.

went there with family on a Friday evening. service was good, menu was very extensive and my wife was overwhelmed with the choice that she had (vegetarian and no wheat can sometimes restrict choice lol). Ordered several dishes which the rest of us shared and the overall experience was tasty and enjoyable. Not cheap, but as they say, you rarely get what you don't pay for! One of the best Indian meals we have had for quite a while (and we have had quite a few

Recently had an opportunity to be there at Punjab Grill for Dinner as well as Lunch experience, both the time i had enjoyed the taste and hospitality given by the Managers. Taste wise i will prefer this as one of the very good restaurant in Singapore, but on the other hand it doesn't fall to be in category to enjoy frequently as the cost wise it is quite expensive. Highly recommend to try it for Food lovers. Looking forward for some reason for next time to visit the place and enjoy the variety of food on the Menu

Food was okay for a top north Indian restaurant. We didn't feel there was anything special in the flavours and not a lot of value for the price.Gol Gappa water lacked zing and was not cold water. Dahi Kabab so so. Malai Kofta lacked flavour. Sarso Ka saag was good.Both Indoor and outdoor seating is below average.Service was fine - they could use some extra waitering staff to cut down on serving time but the ones who served us were quite good.Dont' think I will go back there again

Located opposite the marina bay sands hotel in the shoppes at marina bay mall. In this huge mall the restaurant is tucked away in the left corner. Visited this place for Indian food. The lamb chops, prawn and butter chicken were yummy. The raw mango sorbet to clean the palate and the single pani puri presented the gourmet way was fantastic. Finally the gulab jamun, rabdi and cake for deserts. The price points are expensive.

I recently met someone for lunch at this place. A concierge directed me and I found it easy enough. The other party was inside the restaurant and as I entered, I could smell something rank, musty, unwashed or improperly dried. Like old clothes and wet dog. I gently suggested to my counterpart that we may want to move outside - he thought it was dim, but in reality, I wanted to escape the smell. Later on, as the uniformed waiters walked past, I could smell the same on them. The place needs a THOROUGH cleaning up, change of upholstery (it was not carpeted, which could have been an obvious source of the smell) and new or cleaned-up uniforms.Now for the food. It was not traditional Indian fare, but more of a bit of a fusion. But that is not bad. I had the vegetarian business lunch. The stuffed potato was very good; the green kebab was pasty; I can't remember the third thing. I don't eat rice so I picked off a couple of the plain naan from the bread basket and the simple dal they served was very good. The paneer lababdar was ok, the mixed vegetable was also just ok. The kulfi was not particularly sweet or tasty, the cake was ok and the other thing - some sort of semolina pudding, maybe - might as well have been boiled oats.For the location, price and reputation they need to MAJORLY pull up their act on both the ambience and the food

I had been in this restaurant during my recent visit along with my friend. We had opted for the five course food. Starting with the chat, followed by the grilled salad, tomato Soup, main course & the sweet rasmalai. The dinner was over & followed by the pan shot. This was for the first time i had the pan shot. The idea of having liquid shot of the bettle leaves was out of this wrold for me. The punjabi cuisine was at its best & this food mad
5
Wow!! Punjab grill is really delicious. I highly recommend you go with the set menu if it is your first time, since it will give you a taste of everything. What i really loved in their non-vegetarian set menu was the almond chicken soup (a fragrant chicken soup that taste good), shrimp tandoori, lamb chops ( mouthwatering juicy chops with the right spices, grilled salmon( tender and yummy). In addition, i really enjoyed their curry selection, the butter chicken, fish curry, and dal ( pulse/pea). I highly recommend it for special occasions!
5
Three of us were invited for a business lunch. Besides the delicious food and great service, the restaurant was great for business discussion. Its location at one corner of MBS can make it tricky to find.
5
Went there for team dinner while on business trip... lovely Indian food... best thing to enjoy is their drinks and the Pan shots they serve in the end... All north Indian dishes are amazing... Kulfi is also amazing and Garlic naan are the best...
5
- tandoori jingga (5 huge pieces)
- chicken kadaii
- prawn kadaii
- garlic naan and daal punjab grill
- Saagh ( oh la la)
- Leche ki teri desserts (hope i spelt this properly)
- Kheer ( wow just wow)
5
Great service with a personal touch. Food was authentic and tasty. Traditional dishes with little modern flourishes. We will be back.

Ate her on a late sunday evening in july. The waiter was welcoming and attentive. I had the "butter chicken" (listed under another name in the menu) and it was delicious! We also got complimentary papadums and some kind of mash potato/onion fritters wich was really good. It is a bit pricey, and you order f.ex. curry, than ad nan, rice etc. + drinks. But I would recommend a visit for a special night.
3
Visited twice - based on first experience which was outstanding followed by a relatively ordinary second visit.Lamb chops were excellent as starters, tandoori chicken was average, lamb shank an paneer makhani as mains were really good.Next day the entire taste of the same food was different and not even edible... Service was reasonably attentive and can't fault them. I'm assuming the chefs change otherwise the food should taste same next day too...leading me think your visit depends upon which chef shows up
5
The overall food was good . The service is excellent. Food serving quantity is also good. The only issue is the price. Each dish average cost is 30$ that's equivalent to Rs.1500 which is too much according to Indian prices. The average bill for 5 people came around 8,000-10,000 per time we had lunch or dinner which is too much.Just that we didn't had good food like this in Singapore I would suggest to visit for must and have a great taste food 
5
Well balanced food (very few Restaurants achieve that with Indian cuisine) with some interesting twists. Had a brilliant time there today thanks to very attentive staff. They ensured that the kids were very well engaged during the whole meal. All staff were to keen go the extra mile to ensure a pleasant experience. Will be returning there very soon

I did not know of this place until my Mumbai buddy, who arrived this week, treated me to this well-hidden gem. And the place is well hidden indeed. It is located at the deserted end of the MBS Convention Center, its entire frontage blocked by the massive escalators.My buddy, MJ, wanted me to try the Indian molecular gastronomy made famous by the chain's parent in India. Unfortunately it was not available when we visited, so I did the 5 course Non-Veg degustation menu (SGD95+++) while he did the Veg degustation menu.The grilled meats here are a match for the likes of Peshawri (ITC Grand Maratha, Mumbai). The curries (mains) were most flavorful, but a bit too salty for me. One of the dessert was Lychee in Condensed Milk, most inspired.The prices are on the high-side considering this place feels more like a casual eatery than a fine-dining establishment (and the service a bit spotty). But if I crave authentic north Indian grilled lamb while in Singapore, Punjab Grill is the place to go
5
We received food perfectly as ordered, tastes suited to kids and adults alike. Medium spicy means medium spicy without any compromise on the flavours and presentation. Wonderful veg food, breads, starters and moreVery helpful staff as well. We had children with us and the staff ensured even out fussy little one enjoyed the food. We made a disaster of our own upma made in our hotel room and chef Ahmad sorted it out for us within minutes. Thanks for making our trip to your restaurant and city worthwhile!!
3
I have gone there twice and both the times I was largely disappointed by the service. It takes forever for the food to come in and even then there are mistakes in the order. Not expected when you are shelling out a bomb!
1
Well I never made it passed the front door. I didn't have a reservation and apparently reservations are a "must" even if half the restaurant is empty on a weekday lunch.I had free vouchers to the restaurant and I suspect this is why reservations were a necessity.The guy at the front door was quite rude when conveying their "rules". You expect a restaurant set in such an upscale location to behave professionally
5
I was in Bay for a exhibition and very hungry. I found that there is this Punjab Grill restaurant in mall. The decor was too good and same was the food. The hospitality was truly punjabi with lots of care and personal attention. I loved my lunch here and love to go there again whenever in Singapore next. Don't miss this if you are in Bay area
2
Considering this place is very pricy and marketed through a celebrity chef I would have expected much more. Service was average, food portions were small and the food was nothing special. I have had tastier Indian food in many places around Singapore for a quarter of the price
2
I went to punjab grill thinking that we would get good authentic indian food but i was extremely disappointed. We had order two non veg set meals. The food was cold and didn't taste good at all and the meat didn't seem as if it was fresh and had a strange taste. We only had a few bites and had left the rest cause we just couldn't eat it and the food is really expensive and its not worth the quality of food
5
That was the fourth time we visited . Everything is perfect . We ordered one black Dahl ,one yellow Dahl , one Lamb shank ( actually 2 lamb shanks in one portion) , one garlic nan and one rice . We enjoyed the food . Every time when we come to Singapore, we will definitely come here once.
5
Good decor, Was full on Last saturday so seemed popular - We were group of 11 hungry people. The serve you complimentary starters which are divine - Highly recommend Maan ki Daal ( Black Dal) & bread basket with genuine thick Lassi. Wide choice on Menu too. IS on the pricier side but worth the price. Top Class friendly service & rather intuitive waiters who understood exactly how quickly we wanted to be served & understood our tastes
3
The food is reasonable by the local Indian food standards, however the quality is not as good as that of the food served in their restaurants in India. The food seems overpriced here, however that could be because of the pricey location that the restaurant is located in (MBS). The Kababs are very good and for those who like mutton, their Gilavati kabab are a must tr
4
Indian food has a very special spot in our hearts and stomachs so we will go our way to look for a perfect place to feast and found it at Punjab Grill. By far the best North Indian food we have tasted. The Murgh Malai Tikka, butter and garlic Naan was deliciously good and even the complimentary potato balls and papadams we're really tasty. The red wine paired by the waiter was perfect. Service was friendly, prompt and courteous. What we like most about Punjab Grill is not only the good food but the feeling of welcome and attentiveness from the staff and this made our experience more enjoyable. I can't wait to come back with my whole family again!!
3
The pros: A nice setting good ambient restaurant. Service was attentive and professional. Good for business meal. Unfortunately, the food did not live up to expectation.The kitchen might have toned down the spices to suit the foreign customers. I will not come back when I need a fix for real Indian food
3
We went for a business dinner, it was not a good experience. Took the set meal menu for dinner, for three of us the kebab was under cooked. It is at a good location but food was not that great.
4
Its one of the must have experience with friends in Singapore.It is very well located in the heart of the huge shopping mall. The ambiance and food was very well done up . I found most of the dishes highly over priced .
5
Fantastic food and amazing service. Authentic Indian Food.
While on rate card it may look expensive but the quantity of serving and the quality of food compensate for it.
Special thanks to Bharat and SACHIN for taking super care for us during the visit.
5
The location in shopping mall basement was not so promising, but the food and service was excellent. The Punjab Grill is propably one of the the best Indian restaurant we have ever been.
4
This is, from somebody who loves good Indian food, one of the best Indian meals I've had. The flavours were wonderful, and the service was excellent.The lack of a fifth star is quite honestly because I'm not fond of the mall, but it was close to our hotel and we wanted a special meal during our stay. And yes, it was special despite the usually very high Singapore prices for anything remotely resembling elegant dining
4
This restaurant is in the ostentatious Marina Bay Sands mall. My husband and I dined here on a Wednesday night. We didn't have to book, but nearly all the indoor tables were full, so perhaps it's safer to book if you are a bigger group. The restaurant has lovely decor, the service is prompt and friendly and the food arrived quite quickly (and our plates were warmed). We were very happy with the food. We ordered the Chicken Tkka Masala, Kadhai Jheenga with prawns plain rice and 3 servings of Naan (perhaps we over did it on the naan) and it cost us $167. The food was really, really delicious, lovely flavours, subtle chili and not salty - really good. Even the complimentary papadams were a great food experience
4
Located at Marina bay, so I need not mention about the elegance.... I went without reservation, however staff was courteous to provide me a good table. (I would recommend for reservation for getting a nice table)...Check out the Dahi Kabab as a starter and cocktail lovers can check out "Feel like a Holiday".... Overall : awesome...
5
I brought my wife to this north indian cuisine for dinner on a saturday night. Perhaps the best place to explore indian food in singapore. You will be lost in the taste for sure. We are delighted to the core. From starters, main course and dessert, yu name it from the menu and the they will give you the finest. Incomparable.However, you must also check the price while your reserve to suit your budget.I always will keep going on special occassions as long as i am in singapore
4
My wife and I went there today for lunch (April 16) and ordered a set meal titled "Power Lunch", priced at SGD 45++ (~SGD 53 per person including taxd and service charge, same price for Veg & Non-Veg options).Excellent food- the menu includes:a) Choice of drink- fresh lime water/ soft drinksb) A starter moongdal wadic) Kebab platter- Amritsari Fish, Pesto Chicken and Mutton Seekhd) Surprise Surprise: a taste buds refresher, gelato-kind of scoop to cool down and freshen up the palatee) Main Course: Naan, Steamed Rice, Fish Curry, Saagwala Murgh & Rajmahf) Dessert Platter- gajar halwa, rabdi and Mango SouffleIn a nutshell- DIVINE taste for most of the dishes. Probably rajmah could have been a bit better. But the overall experience- service levels (maybe would like to come on a weekend to see if it stays that way), food quality- was superb.Strongly recommended

For a muslim visiting singapore finding halal food can be a challenge ,we stumbled upon punjab grill in singapore for lunch. We opted for the lunch offer they had , it was excelllent . The portions were amazing and the food was extremely good. The staff if i may add were excellent, they made sure we liked everything . If ur going to singapore , u should try it . Its location was perfect in marina bay sands mal
5
We had dinner here with family and friend and we were not disappointed. We enjoyed the food and service. We enjoyed every dish and some surprise dishes. It is bit pricy but worth the price.
5
Hospitality - more than 100%
Ambience - 9/10
Food - 9/10
Experience - 10/10
Overall, we were awestruck by small surprises with their side-dishes (complimentary) and the hospitality shown.
4
Good Muglai traditional recipes,a nice option for indian food loving visitors,decent decor but highly priced.
5
A great place to have northern Indian food. Amazing dal, great chaat items, and all nicely cooked and fresh. Amazingly tasty place. Very yummy but very pricey too.
5
One of the best punjabi restaurant in Singapore.taste is amazing and also the ambience of the place is nice.you feel as if you are in India.
5
If you would like to try a fine dining Indian place in Singapore, then this place is nice. Cant say a lot about ambience as it is located in Marina Bay Sands Shopping Centre.. So it is compact, smart. But doesn't really command any goodwill by virtue of its ambience as much as for food.The best deal if you are just two people is their sett lunch which is a lovely ensemble of 3 varieties of Indian starters, a lovely Indian drink, main course comprising of 2 vegetables, one dhal and indian breads, and a platter of 3 desserts. The highlight is the betel leaf and vanilla drink at the end of this 5 course (literally) meal!Priced at 45++,(for non veg as well as veg) it works out to about 105$ for 2 people but the amount and variety of food you get to savour more or less encompasses all you should be trying!So go for it if you don't mind the price.. Because It is worth it
3
Visit this restaurant with a friend. The dark interiors and the damp and musty smell was off putting. The starters were ok. The dal Makhani a bit bland. Have eaten at The Punjab grill in India that's way way better. Good for a quick Indian meal if you are in the vicinity. But, nothing special to write home about. Wouldn't go bac

Having been to many North Indian fine dining restaurants, I was very keen on trying Punjab Grill while I was visiting Singapore. The starters were great and I l found the complementary pallet cleansers were a nice touch. However the smell in the restaurant was very off putting and smelt like damp, when requesting a scented candle or something that would help with the smell I was told there was nothing they had but acknowledged that there was a distinctive smell. The Long Island ice tea wasn't to usual taste therefore I stuck to regular soft drinks. The channa masala had an overpowering amount of powdered spices (I enjoy spicy food) which made eating it difficult! Overall the ambiance was nice besides the smell but I can't say I'd go back in a hurry!
5
It's not a restaurant that I would visit again in a hurry as the food is very rich and a bit pricey (although with decent portion sizes so can't complain). But once in a while is good! We just landed there one Tue evening without reservation and were told we could sit in the outside space. Which I anyway preferred over the inside of the restaurant.I ordered the 5 course tasting menu and hubby got himself a biryani. Everything we had was absolutely yumm! The service was good too. And they kindly put up with our very messy and somewhat cranky toddler. I would happily return - in a few months :
3
This was our first time in the Sands Marina Bay mall, so we didn't know where the best food spots would be. We tried the Punjab Grill because we were in the mood for a curry.There were some good signs in terms of the overall experience - they brought us a pre-starter which is always a nice touch, and the layout of the restaurant is visually attractive.However, I felt it was a let down for the aesthetics that the doors to the kitchen were visibly scuffed and dirty, and indeed the lights in the ceiling were very dusty and had become twisted. I could see the chairs were not super clean. In other words, signs to me that the standards of upkeep have slipped. Quite minor in itself, but it takes the edge off and of course makes you wonder where else corners are being cut.The food we had was fine and promptly served, although rather bland. We also found it very expensive for what it was. I think this was partly because we had not yet adjusted to high prices in Singapore City centre locations, but it certainly felt poor value.Overall -- ok, but nothing special I'm afraid. Not somewhere we would choose to go back to
5
Very nice place with great ambiance mouth watering dishes with a taste of authenticity and to top it off excellent service.
4
We had dinner at Punjab Grill. Since it was crowded, we sat outside. If you're at the Marina Bay sands, it's worth a visit to taste the Indian food.
5
We had taken dinner during our recent visit and it was truly Punjabi experience.The food was tasty and servings were adequate ,value for money .
4
again this was my second visit to this restaurant and this time also was not disappointed
and was happy with what we ordered . the portions was good so nothing much to say here
5
I really loved the kebab platter at Punjab grill. In Singapore the best place to have North Indian Cuisine. Real Indian and authentic. Its a casual dinning restaurant with a small wine cellar. I loved the place a lot for foodies. I thank the courteous staff there. For me its a restaurant of its own class.
1
I visited this place 3 years ago and found it quite nice and eye catching with decent food . But to my surprise , a recent visit here on Valentine's day eve with my wife was a disgusting experience. The quality of this place has dropped drastically which was visible both in food and ambiance. As soon we entered , i found the place filled with a strange smell showing that it hasn't been maintained properly. There were apparent marks of dirt on floor and on corners of walls. The staffs were not very welcoming and looked as if they are just doing their job for the sake of doing it. We had taken a set menu which was priced at 198++ SGD per couple . What they offered in that was complete disappointment. There is something called a "portion" of a dish which they seem completely unaware. They literally served a single piece of each starter which they quoted in the menu .. a single piece of cottage cheese , a patty , a single chicken piece . OMG. The main course was a further disappointment .. no taste in food , not even well served . I totally screwed my evening by opting for this place. Guys don't go by the name of JIGS Karla , you can find a HELL lot of better places than this in singapore with quality food and reasonable prices. They are just reaping the fruits of some good service done in earlier years but the current state of this place is just pathetic. Its OK if some place is pricey , at least you get a value for your money . But here , I felt like totally cheated . I wouldn't suggest anyone to go this place. There are far better ways to spend your hard earned money than visiting this place !!

Dined here with my family last September, on a quiet Saturday for lunch. Cone shaped papads were served along with mango chutney, garlic infused yogurt and mint chutney once we were seated.For appetisers we had a platter of morels of chicken marinated in yogurt, cashew nut gravy and cheese along with panko fried halibut fish with Asian pesto and basil, coriander tiki stuffed with goat cheese and cranberries. For mains we ordered assorted naan, butter chicken, saag gohst (lamb with spinach sauce) dhal panjratani and for desserts we had nutty chocolate praline torte and saffron kulfi. The butter chicken was subtly spiced, rich and creamy. The chicken was cooked to perfection. It was bursting with flavours. The saag gohst was average though. The dhal was excellent. The naans were soft, fluffy and aromatic. The desserts were awesome too. The paan shots were kinda unique. Over all, the food was awesome, excellent ambience and fantastic service. Definitely, one of the top indian restaurants in Singapore
4
The service and advice from staff are really great. The food is tasty. however if you want the food to be spicy please request that as the curries are mild and sumptuous. The prices are high so make sure that you are prepared to pay premium prices for the meal
5
Appreciable service and presentation of food. Food quality and quantity both are aligned with expectations. We ordered their set lunch and were quite satisfied with the portions. But set lunch will not have their special items (both in veg and non veg) which are a must try
4
There were 8 of us. We started with a simple salad and an interesting Punjab starter, paadhi chat. Pleasing to tease the palate. We then have a mixed tandoori; chicken, lamb and fish. For main course we had the rogan josht (tender lamb in a spicy, but not hot gravy), a paneer palak (spinach and cottage cheese) and a nice curry prawns. Had some lovely garlic nan, pratha bread and a vegetarian biryani. Wrapped up the meal with a variety of Indian sweets. Reasonable price for the portion, service and location. Will certainly bring my Muslim clients and friends to this restaurant again
5
On a recent visit to SIngapore, i visited the PunJab Grill and was blown away. I have eaten Indian food around the world and this place is up there with the best of them. Service was outstanding. Best Nan i have had thus far.
4
High end indian restaurant at Marian Bay Sands, good food, expensive but really worth going and trying in... Service was good, we reached at around 3 pm and it was about to shut down for break but still the staff was receptive enough to offer us the last order with no compromise in the quality of food and service... Offered a compliementary snack and a pan shot for desert... The curries were awesome with soothing punjabi songs all the way... Overall, a royal experience with a notable pick on your pocket...
5
All the days of our stay in Singapore, I was having food from mcd, or dominos, but glad I made a visit to Punjab grill restaurant at shoppes in marina bay on my last day of stay there . I with my husband n my daughter, went for dinner n drinks to Punjab grill . The attentiveness by the waiters and service was excellent by the staff n waiters ,we we're served food by Sudershan shetty , extremely polite and cheerful and courteous person. The ambience was nice, though little overpriced but worth it , as food was excellent ,me n my daughter enjoyed and so my husband . Would love to visit again on my next visit to Singapore !!!
5
The food was nice but it definitely wasn't worth what we paid for it... In my opinion the restaurant is over priced. I will still mark it as 5 stars as we enjoyed the food but we won't visit again unless the prices were more reasonable
5
We were really impressed with this restaurant - the menu looked tantalizing and it didn't fail to meet those high expectations! Beautiful combinations of ingredients and extremely attentive service. I was not allowed to serve myself once as the waiters would immediately come over and oblige! Great dining experience touches like the different take on poppadums and digestive tonic at the end of the meal! Highly recommend the seafood platter to share and if you still have room go for the dessert platter too! Can't wait to try the others in India when next there
2
We came across this restaurant while staying at Marina Bay Sands hotel. The restaurant is in the attached shopping centre to the hotel and were lacking Indian food. The food is not designed for Indian or people who know about Indian or Asian food. The palette is designed for people who have no knowledge about Indian food. The Punjabi black daal was full of cream and lacked the essential urid daal. It was extremely mild and tasteless but the children enjoyed it as lacked any flavour or taste. The Naan was ok but at S$10 a naan, it's horrendously priced. If you want authentic good quality Indian food, I would recommend catching a taxi to Little India. Not impressed and even further not impressed with the price of the meal.
5
We were lucky enough to stumble across this restaurant. We have eaten in many excellent restaurants, but when it comes to indian food this is the truly the best. To sit and eat so slowly and savour the flavours zipping around in your mouth is something amazing. Not easy to find and not cheap, but worth the effort and the $$$.All of the food was amazing. The potatoes were bordering on orgasmic, and tika chicken was so incredible, I would pay a fortune for the recipe. As a snob foodie, I do not write a review like this ever!!!!! When I visit Singapore again, I will travel extraordinary distances to visit this restaurant again. If you like indian food, do yourself a favour and find this place. Service also excellent

Have been to Punjab Grill for my Anniversary Lunch, on my friend's recommendation. Thankful to my friend for this amazing suggestion.We ordered for their Set menu for the weekend and was stunned by seeing the presentations of the starter platter which looked colorful with Black slate base type and the yummy paneer Tikka & stuff.The Chutney and the papadums served were the perfect accompaniment with the food.It keeps you busy in between the courses.The Ambush & the sorbet palate cleanser were something very new to us.The mains were served pipping hot Biryani, dal Makhani & mix of hot & fresh breads. The dal was die for, the best I ever had. Biryani was also made to perfection.The time desserts were served we were totally full with no space left.But the server forced us to have some as its was something we could miss.The desserts were also amazing, we finished them till last bite. That tells you how it tasted.The magic tissues was something surprising to us & lastly the liquid paan shots ( Much Needed) after a delicious Indian Meal making Our culinary journey At Punjab Grill Complete.A must go place with friends & family.The staff Served us with smile every time we needed them.The chefs done the great job too.Good food made & served with Smile. Will be back soon. Thank you :
4
Ok, the food here is to die for. Its absolute delicious, no other comment.But i am disappointed with the service. I wish the staff is given some training as how a plate is served on table. i dont think i can take someone serving plate like throwing when i am paying for the food. Well, I will go again to this restaurant to enjoy the food, but i really hope the management work on the service to make the over all experience more delight
5
We hosted our ROM lunch at Punjab Grill and needless to say our guests were delighted. Not only was the Power lunch Menu varied with a unique menu for starters, the portions were generous too. This was the first time a vegetarian menu seemed to satisfy the traditional non-veg kebab lovers too. All in all we had an amazing lunch and couldnt have asked for more. MBS is a great location for a roof top view after lunch or dinner ! Keep up the quality and service
2
Overhyped. The food was not upto the mark. The starters I had were overcooked. Only the dal and biryani was good. Rest all was pretty average.
5
Best curry in a long time. Good selection of tandoori specialties and curry. Loved the potato achari starter. Spacious restaurant with nice ambience and great service. Generous portions
4
Service is excellent, food are expected of the standard of a fine dining. Tasty and very well done to perfection. Will come back . Likes the brani rice and tandoori .
4
This is the Punjab Grill in the Marina Bay Sands Mall where we went for dinner one evening, a party of four, and we chose a main course each and then mixed and shared rice and bread, the food was very good without being spectacular, the sauces being smooth and well made.Service was very good and we did not wait long for the food once the orders were placed, staff were helpful without being intrusive, and additional drinks were to hand very quickly on request.I would recommend this for an evening out, we had a quick dinner after a day at work on an exhibition, it would be nice to go back and spend a whole evening at a more relaxed time.
5
When in Singapore I was invited for lunch at this Indian place - Normally I would expect an indian to be a bit worn and food to be, well standard indian style, as I cannot see how you can make it much different - BUT how wrong I was - This place is in a class by itself - The fodd was newly designed, servings were very ample but served as in an almost french style yet kept its Indian originas. Service was outstanding and very attentive. And words fail me to describe how well the food tasted.Can only say well done to the restaurant - I will be going back there for sure
5
The Punjab Grill is probably one of the better Indian restaurants I have eaten in... couple of things like the Chhole are cooked just the way one remembers eating them in Delhi... the portions are respectable...however, everything is expensive: a vegetarian meal of just a Dal, a subzi and 2 breads with 1 drink each is likely to set you back by >$SGD100++... usual prices are 2-3 times what you would pay at a usual sit-down Indian restaurant... to be fair, the restaurant provides excellent service: the staff is unfailingly courteous and they provide small sweet touches like the paan like digestive... a very good restaurant overall with the potential of becoming a great one...
4
a fine dining restaurant ,north indian cuisine served in a lavish setting at the basement of mbs, pricy but high quality and tasty indian dishesThe cocktails are nice too! not to forget their signature paan shot at a mouth freshener as the dinner finaleThe staff is very courteous and willing to customise dishes to customers taste. Fabulous experience overall
5
We dined at Punjab Grill for dinner. The service was outstanding. Friendly and attentive from start to finish. A special shout out to Praveen who looked after us so well.We started with tandoori duck, scallops and mushrooms. All were excellent however the scallops were to die for. Brilliant dish and the standout of the night for me. The curries were a great subtle butter chicken and a lamb shank curry. The lamb was delicious and falling off the bone. Alomg the way we were given a cauliflower amuse bouche that was superb, a raspberry sorbet as a palate cleanser and a bitter leaf and ice cream drink as a digestive. Desserts were very good as well with Rasmalai, chocolate fudge and Gulab Jamun the standouts.We loved the Punjab Grill. It is pricey so be warned but it was worth it to us for the best Indian food we have had in a long time

This place is great in that it does some real great Punjabi food by sticking to the basics, which does not mean that it doesn't speak to experiment. We ordered a non vegetarian platter, a dal and some fish curry. I loved the mini meals in the interim that the servers brought in like the potato tiki and the raspberry sorbet.In all, the food was great. It brought back some good memories. The service was brilliant - they were there when you needed them. Full marks for the food and the service. That being said, the pricing is not for the faint hearted. So if you're looking for value, head elsewhere. Nevertheless, I'd return and I'd recommend people to head there if they are looking to celebrate a special occasion

This is definitely one of the best food joints for Indians in Singapore. Loved the ambience and also the food was delicious. Although a little costly considering we ordered little and still the bill was SGD 75 Dollars... Worth the visit at least once if you an Indian and on a tour to Singapore
3
Consider lunch buffet compared to a`la carte menu.
Ambience is good being within 'The Shoppes by the Bay'.
Worth mentioning about deserts, which stood out among the lunch items served
5
This is an amazing place to have food, you will get all those dishes you would order in India with the same taste. Little bit expensive as compared to others. for 2 persons your bill should be around SGD 150 - 200.
5
Decent selection of wine and fantastic execution of food, beautiful platings. Waiters & chef were attentive checking in if we need refills of food & drinks. Restaurant could use better ventilation.
4
This is a must go. Excellent selection of fine food with a very good service.
The place is very clean and comfortable.
5
I haven't had better biriyani in all these yrs in Singapore. Their fish dishes and hara bhara kabab are a must try. Price A little on the higher side but food more than makes up for it.

Your Review
Was good and would go again. Price offer range could be better. Service was very good and friendly

This is easily one of my favorite restaurants for Indian food in Singapore. Great for occasional visits as it is quite expensive and the food is very rich and heavy too. If you are there on a weekday, try their set lunch menu. It's my favorite as you get their 5 course meal. I love the maaki ki roti and sarson ka saag, one of the best I have had in singapore. Don't miss out on the paan shots they give at the end! A meal for 2 easily comes to $15

I have dined at some so-called Indian restaurants in Singapore but the food there was a poor imitation of Indian food. Punjab grill turned out to be different. The food here is really Indian. But that is about all. I have been to many better restaurants in India. So, don't expect too much in terms of service, quality of food or value for money
5
I was there with 2 other friends and a hyper-active 2yr old child for dinner on 30th Sept. Stunning ambience, great attitude and unbiase crews. Food were flavourful, the portion was appropriate for us. We like its unique way of serving soup and interesting cutlery used. Adding credit to them, our 2yr old boy were running around uncontrollably and sticking to the crews while they were working. Many times we tried to settle him down with no avail. We were extremely thankful to the crews as they embraced and played along with him. Further to this, they even gave him desserts n fruits. They really did help in allowing us to have a comfortable and peaceful dinner throughout. We will definitely be back for more

Went here with great expectations but was disappointed.The Good :-1.very very friendly and efficient waiter2. very good ambience3. Typical punjabi menu4. Good "dhaal makhani" ( Black lentils with butter).The bad :-1. Very very average tasting butter chicken2. very very average naans ( Indian bread)3. very very expensive . The bill for two people ( no drinks or desert) came out to almost 150 us$.Will I return? NoDo I recommend ? Only, if you have money to "burn" and dying to eat Indian food in a high end place.If the review was helpful, kindly click on "Yes, the review was helpful" tab

The food was pretty average which was not expected given the high prices. This was probably the worst dining experience I had in Singapore. I don't think I'll be returning.
5
I went to Punjab grill for lunch on Sunday with my husband. Really we enjoyed the food. The service was fantastic. The price is reasonable and portions served are good. Service is really awesome the staffs are well trained. Totally Punjab grill is excellent.
5
We chose this restaurant after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and were very impressed. Dishes, both starters and mains were outstanding, service is totally professional and restaurant interior is well designed and classy. Restaurant is upscale and not cheap but this is a place to treat yourself and have a truly top-level meal
5
Have been there with family and friends a couple of times. All our diners there have been a gastronomic experience. They surprise with their fusion indian food. Very good presentation of food Chicken Tikka Masala, Sumandri Pulaf, Chicken Briyani, mushroom soup are just a few of the dishes that are to die for and the best I ever had. Chef Javed together with Chef Satinder brought a fantastic Menu to the table
5
I gone with my friends to Punjab grill and we had beer feast, that was an amazing experience. Ambience is too good and the music as well. The key is service, great service by praveen and he is an assert to the company. Politely explained about the food and the preparation. He entertained us with the magical towels and so on. We suggest all our friends to visit. Thank you.

Punjab Grill located in Marina Bay Sands serves you freshly cooked North Indian dishes . It caters to variety of Non Vegetarian & vegetarian food served with freshly oven baked Indian Breads ( Rotis).It is a spacious Restaurant with good ambience . Service is prompt & well presented by well trained & polite staff

We went to Punjab Grill for lunch and had the Veg Executive Set Lunch. The Papad and chutneys (Mint, Garlic-Yogurt, Mango) were delicious and we were hoping that would set the tone for the rest of the meal. The starters were presented beautifully - Paneer Tikka, Amritsari Baby Corn, & a Vegetable Patty - the first two were very tasty but the patty could've done with more flavour. Main course had Kadai Mushroom & Bell Pepper (nothing much to write home about), Paneer Makhni (rich and creamy gravy and really melt-in-the-mouth), and Dal Panchratan (which was definitely missing something, possibly salt). The Tandoori & Lacha paratha were good, and so was the steamed rice. Dessert again was artfully presented - Fig Kheer (average), Rose petal cheesecake (too firm to be cheesecake), and Gulabjamun (the best of the lot). They had interesting drinks in shot glasses - Lassi and a very unique non-alcoholic Paan Shooter!The call out is for the service - friendly, well-informed, and pleasant. The staff here are a huge plus. The ambiance is nice as well - calm and unhurried. The food definitely needs to be notches better if we have to go back though
5
From the ambience to the food and he staff, I have always enjoyed my diners at Punjab Grill. The presentation of food is one that I have never seen in any other restaurant. Their chefs Javed and Satinder are too good. Food that we enjoy most are: chicken tikka masala, Samundri pilau, saag, god I can go on and on.Always looking forward going to Punjab grill.The best indian restaurant in Singapor
5
Authentic Indian tastes with modern presentation! Been there umpteen times and ALWAYS had a supreme experience. Chef Javed is an absolute master and his team churns out consistent high quality Indian food every time. All this with excellent service puts Punjab Grill on the top of my list as a destination for celebratory or casual meals with family and friends
5
I had recently visited this place with my family, the ambience of your place was superb & especially the wondeful service by your staff Praveen Wilson was impeccable. He was vey courteuos to my old parents which I liked the most , his decent & warm customer service was amazing. We enjoyed your restaurant's ambience & food. Please do convey our regards to Mr.Praveen. All the best Punjab Grill

Awesome authentic indian punjabi food with rich & fine ingredients ....... Beautiful presentation & gr8 service.......:)
4
best for tandoori - juicy and succulent but average for others
biryani was rather soggy for our liking
5
I love this place and have visited in many occasions both for lunch and dinner. The service is impeccable and the food well prepared and presented. Of course this comes at a price, but you'll think it is worth it.
5
It's a good place to have a business meeting. Tasty and authentic food with some twist. Service were great. They took care of our privacy.
5
Had a beautiful meal here on a trip with a friend to Singapore. We had a 9 and 10 year old with us and our waiter Sudarshan made the girls feel very welcome, and gave us excellent advice on what was mild and what was not. Also on the quantity of food we would require and he was spot on. The food was delicious, girls especially loved the sorbet served between courses! our waiter Sudarshan even did a magic trick at the end of the meal, the girls loved it, and we loved the food

Gone to this place in Singapore. Located in a very exotic place ,Marina Bay Sands. Excellent location,very well connected and in one of the high end places in Singapore. Ambience is good,nothing unique to strike like a Punjabi Restaurant. Staff is very well dressed and they are the sole torch bearers of Punjabiyat in this place. The food has a Gujarati start with Khakra to our surprise. Food is rich but defies Punjabiyat again. May be it has been modified for Local population. However a hard core Amritsari food lover was a bit disappointed. Again the helpings were small,not a Punjabi trait. However the bill was big, just as big as any Punjabi restaurant should have. The best part was fingers wash at the end. The concept was new and interesting. You will have to go yourself to enjoy it.PS ; Food from North India has Desi Ghee showing not blended with the food,may be I am growing old
1
Cant say anything bur bad slow service Our kids dish asked to be not spicy but came spicy and after a while the chef come and asked of we wished for him to make a non spicy food:(And food was not that goodHave eaten much better else wher
5
On a recent holiday to Singapore, we dined at this beautiful restaurant on our last night before returning home to Scotland. The service from the staff was first class and the food was amazing. The manager was very efficient and had everything well organised on a very busy Saturday night.Will certainly eat here again when we return to Singapore next year
5
We weren't sure want to expect when we visited. The menu was quite different from an Indian in the UK and didn't feature many of the stable favourites.We chose a chicken biryani and a chicken tandoori together with a pineapple raita and a plain naan. The waiter warned us that plays were large but when it arrived, well....!The tandoori featured 5 or 6 large pieces of chicken thigh. Definitely enough for two, particularly if you have devoured the poppodoms they bring you. The biryani came in its own copper pot covered with a pastry cover. It was delicious (as was the tandoori). No sauce (so the raita and chutneys were welcome) but it was honestly one of the most flavoursome non greasy indians we have ever had. I would definitely return. Admittedly it was pricey but then so is everything foodwise in Singapore
5
I took clients visiting from India to impress with this Iconic Indian fine dining restaurant in MBS. Food was predictably great with wholesome dal, juicy kebabs and wide variety of beautifully cooked naan selection. Ambiance and Service doesn't miss a point, where Restaurant Manager Manu Orchestra tic service taking care of our party. I strongly recommend Punjab Grill while visiting Singapore. I will be back agin
1
Terrible service, shabby ambiance, too pricey and definitely not worth it. We ordered the giloti kebab. The meat was and had a metallic taste in it. We sent it back and were again sent the same thing. When sent back again the server started arguing with me. We were charged for the kebabs anyway.Moreover, the place is not maintained at all and in a shabby (the side door to the kitchen is stained and opens into a junk room full of boxes visible to anyone sitting at the table). The service is terrible and servers not trained properly. People kept moving dustbins and garbage out of the kitchen, and through the restaurant in the middle of lunch hours! It was not at all worth the SGD100 per person our bill came to for food. We had a terrible experience
5
After touring the botanical gardens and the Sands in Singapore, we we're ready to cold down and enjoy a nice meal. We walked around the mall, and saw the Punjab Grill and recalled ready some great reviews on one of our travel magazines. We had the most amazing Indian ever. We ordered chicken t chicken time and a pistachio nut chicken and yoghurt paste. Every ingredient was freshly ground with a pestle and mortar, and was cooked to perfection. We had stuffed potatoes cakes with fresh mint and peas, the flavors just popped in your mouth. Even the iced tea was delicious, the insides of the glass were rubbed with mint leaves and lemon peel. The service was impeccable. Even though I was full, I continued to pick at the food because it was so delicious. It's pricey, but worth every penny
3
I had the vegetarian set lunch. 2 small chickpea based balls and a hand full of mixed veg as the main... Unless you want to eat a heap of bread and rice you'll need to eat again in an hour. For $40 it is so not worth it
4
There are times when I visit singapore for Punjab grill for the past two years, now I can rate the food average in terms of perfection, flavour, and service.i spoke with chef javed and he is keen on perfection too but if the meat is served medium cooked perfection customers are rejecting as it is not cooked well and he's transformed in to some perfection which most customers like than to have a culinary perfection.sad about our indian foodies grow up taste the real perfections of chef javed speak to him let him decide his own pefection and see the magic melting in your mouth which you cannot get in any of Punjab grill in India
4
Very very nice authentic indian food , good options for vegetarians too , friendly staff , good taste just as u have it here in India, Pan shot at the end of the meal is too too good and that wonder hand napkin magic for kids
5
I just visited Punjab grill few days back with my friends. We loved the food there..biryani is the best I have had in long time.I strongly recommend pple to try the food there ..... Staff are helpful... I was impress my one of the staff who was in sherwani, fair and tall guy... He seems to have good knowledge of food..
5
I really loved the food which was authentic Indian food. It was cook to perfection and service was excellent. Special thanks to tall fair guy in sherwani for his swift and helpful service.I recommend punjabi grill to others to try because food and ambience both are great....
1
Punjab Grill used to be my family's all time favorite and still nobody beats them in "Quality of Food". However, their staff has become complacent as far the service is concerned.... past 2 times consecutively I've experienced a pathetic service & attitude of their frustrated staff. If the management is "Awake".... better start understanding that you are ruining the brand and loyal customers
5
This is Indian cuisine with style. Everything we tasted was unusual and delicious. The waiter was very helpful explaining the different dishes and his advice on what to choose was spot on. The wine menu goes perfectly with the dishes. The desserts were absolutely delicious and so unusual. This was fine dining at it's best
5
Not our first visit as this restaurant is fantastic. I love the layout with the view through to the kitchen, the ambience is truly peaceful with comfortable seating and great table settings. The Staff were wonderful, helpful and attentive. A big fan of Tandoor we had the duck, lamb and lobster.....WOW. We are not 3 course eaters, but next time, and the will be a next time, we will try all the courses. Worth a visit you will not be sorry
4
Superb food must try . The ambience of the restaurant is good . The staff are excellent . The menu is awesome and the preparations are authentic tinkling one's taste buds .
5
Very nice location, excellent service, great food, cosy environment, pricey but OK to eat there for big occasions.
4
We loved this place for authentic punjabi food,cocked to perfection and served with attention to details. Their dal makhani is the best we have eaten and trust us we have tried zillions of place. Our son loves butter chicken dish, have been there thrice and won't try anything else.
4
Didnt do a reservation and went in impromptu.. However, it was full inside so we were offered the seating area outside.. I had the best palak paneer and kulfi ever.. The serving quantity was also good.The only thing I hoped that could be better was the roti.. It was a bit hard. A bit pricey but good for special occasion. Do make reservation if you want to get a good seat. I ll visit again
5
Second visit and this time a work group. We all picked the tasting menu which was up to scratch in terms of quality, quantity and service.Tip: There are three appetisers (great soup - lovely chicken and almond). If you eat all of these then you'll find you're going to struggle with the curries! Save some space for those and for the desserts!Special mention - I can't recall our waiter's name, but he was lovely. Always happy to explain what the course was, what the food was and it was always with a smile.If I could improve one thing, it would be to make the curries a little spicier. However, my husband and I are both used to spicy food, where as some of our group weren't, so we can understand the restaurant's caution here
5
This is Indian at the high end, the service is excellent the choices amazing, we had the degustation lunch, be prepared for a big walk after. The meal was well balanced & exotic, once you have your main curry selection you are offered more of any of the dishes (you wont need it we couldnt finish our first serving). Wine prices reasonable for Singapore. We'll be back
5
The quality of food at this restaurant is very good, and combined with the outstanding service provided, adds up to a excellent dining experience. We (4 adults & 2 children) dined there recently, and as well as the meals we ordered, the management and staff very happily supplied extra tasting dishes, papa dams, and side dishes totally free of charge. They weren't asked for, they just brought them out to us. They were obviously pleased to do this, seemingly for no reason other than to ensure we had a great dining experience, which we certainly did
4
Singapore is blessed with restaurants to cater to every palette. Prices vary too. Punjab Grill by Jiggs Kalra at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands is on the higher end of the price scale. Food is tasty I must say. We had a 5 course Degustation Menu (S$ 95/- per person). Presentation was nice, up to the 3rd course. Grilled Lamb and the Tiger Prawns tasted so good! Then we were served Sauteed Asparagus with Lamb Briyani. It was superbly done. Then came a basket of crispy, fresh Naan bread. Accompanying curries(fish, chicken & dhal) were quite ordinary and I really wished they changed plates instead of serving all 3 curries onto the same briyani plate while we were still eating. I felt that it was a bit too messy!The liquid shot of "paan" at the end of the meal was interesting & refreshing!Service was quite good. They even asked whether we liked more briyani etc. It was friendly, personal service. I would go there again, may be on a special occasion
5
I went to this restaurant for dinner with my husband while on honeymoon in Singapore. We decided to go for the vegetarian taster menu and it was the best decision we have made in a restaurant! The food was not only delicious, but the quantities were huge too! The staff was very friendly and explained the different authentic spices they used in Punjabi cooking, especially the rare kind of expensive mushroom they used in one of their rice dishes. The highlight of the dinner were the pan shots which we enjoyed a lot and were given a second time!
5
One of the best India food, I have ever had. It's Guchi Pulao is just divine. Though it is expensive but it's worth trying and you will not mind spending here. Just try it once and you will go back there for sure on special occasions at the minimum
5
Punjab grill, as the name stands serves the best indian, punjabi food in Singapore with its elite ambience and fine dining.
3
I have been here about 4-5 times. Located in MBS, this is touted as a fine dining experience.Having been to their restaurant in Bangalore, I must say that the one in Singapore is a tad too expensive for the quality & taste of the food. The waiters always appear to be busy even though there is very very less crowd. It was frustrating to get the attention of a waiter. They just keep moving here and there and do some adjustments to the furniture and cutlery for no reasons. They are supposed to look at the customers and ensure they are served. Something that is disgusting for a high priced restaurant. I have been there for lunch, dinner and also tried the Sat/Sun brunch feast. The food is richly made with very good quality of spices for sure. The taste is also good. The tikkas and tandoori dishes literally melt in the mouth. The biryani is made in the traditional North Indian style. Definitely worth a try. The Sat/Sun brunch feast has 4 kebabs offered unlimited. (2 chicken, 1 lamb & 1 fish) The fish is a deep fried patte which in my opinion may not be repeated by the customers. The rest of them are good. After the kebab starters, Naan/roti with one curry is served. Then the biryani is served in small pots (good for one individual). The desserts followed by the pan shot completes the feast. Priced around 40$ (excl GST & Service tax), this is a better option if you want to try this place
3
Went with high expectations left satisfied. Not sure if we would go back again which is not a good sign. We ordered entrees and mains everything arrived together, rice for two is $22 seems a little bit rich. We ordered two entrees and two mains, nann bread and rice, the waiter then wanted us to order one more main dish which thankfully we declined as we could not finish the four dishes ordered between two. With a bill of over $300 including a bottle of wine at $75 we question the value knowing very well the cost of dinning out in Singapor
5
This is one of the best restaurants in Singapore not just for the amazing food but also for the fantastic and very personal service. The food is tantlising, mouthwatering, melt in your mouth, more-ish and just damn tasty! The key to a good Indian restaurant in Singapore is how many Indians visit and every time I have been to the Punjab Grill is has 90% Indians in enjoying their food with their families. The service from the staff is fantastic, everything you need you get and they love kids and are very accommodating. They do need more Reislsing and sweeter wines on their menu to compliment the vast array of amazing dishes for vegetarians and meat lovers but it's a small concern compared with the high quality of food and service that we have got every time we visit. Highly recommended
5
We were very keen to try out this famous restaurant that most of the sites have listed. But was also a bit worried about the prices. Anyways we decided to combine my birthday lunch and a New Year lunch. I absolutely loved the experience. We are vegetarians so I can comment definitely on the veg options. I started with a drink - Shikanjvi (the menu said typical Punjabi drink that is sweet, sour, salty and pepper(y) at the same time. It was really good. Very close to a Jaljeera but different. Wife asked for a Singapore Sling cocktail and she was very pleased with her choice. The appetizers served were khakra with mint dip, garlic dip, moraba. We could not have enough of that and had to stop ourselves to keep space for the main course. For starters we asked for Kurkuri veg which again as per the menu description are rolls filled with mushrooms, pine nuts, sun-dried tomatoes etc. They were coated with I guess sev and to be dipped in a sweet sauce. When we spend time reading the menu for the main course and focusing on the khakra the waiter was nicely advised us to better have it when its hot and crisp. For the main course we went with the traditional Sarson da Saag with Makai Roti. And a Dal Punjab Grill with Butter Naan. It was really nice. The sarson da sag was served with jagery and butter incase you find the mustard curry bitter. Though we were absolutely fine with the taste I did enjoy having it with the jagery and butter. The service is very attentive (at just the right level). And to end the awesome lunch we were given "paan shot". Looked like a tequila shot but I guess (and it tasted like) a liquid paan or something. We were full (I know we did eat a lot incase you took the trouble to read thorough the whole review). The bill came to SGD 168. Though one of the most expensive lunch I had in Singapore must say I am more than willing to go back (ahem.. for some special occasions only I guess
5
We love the Punjab Grill, The food is fantastic everything is delicious and there are some creative and interesting flavours as well as some more traditional indian dishes. The staff are superb, we have eaten here many times but this was our first time with our 11 month old son,the staff were fantastic with him and kept him entertained. The portions are also quite large and the food is rich and filling so be careful, on our first visit we ordered a starter each, a main course each and a side dish it was way too much food for 2 people so now we order things to share. There is only one small area where there is room for improvement and that is the wine list, there is a lack of variety as the list is very small and there are none of the wines that you would normally pair with a curry
5
We ate in this resturent acutely l loved the papadam was really nice the best one I taste in my life , the meat kabab was excellent , the rice was not nice I dont know but was bellow avarge , the masallah was not bad we tried the chicken and the prawns was good but I was full and the food so heavy I couldt complete it , the atmosphere nice the survice great , the price is too much for indian food , especially we came from country full of indian lovely food and cheap ,,,
4
In one of the ritzy malls in Singapore, great location near the Marina and our hotel. Staff and service were attentive and on the ball. They went out of their way to accommodate us and our two year old son, who was fortunately on his best behavior for this meal :) That is the highlight of the meal. The food was good, average for Indian in our experience....the prices were astronomical for what we had, nearly S$225 for the three of us and we did little damage to the menu! We walked away satiated, but feeling we could have save S$100 or more and had more and better food for the money, so a low point in walking home. The decor was nice, modern chic and dimly lighted. We would do it again, but only at half the price! We are so-so on this one
4
We had flown in that day from the UK so our time clock was off. We took a taxi from our hotel which dropped us off at the splendid, over the top Shops at Marina Bay Sands where Punjab Grill is located.It took a while to find the restaurant.Few tables were occupied , it was 6.30pm. So maybe early to eat. The restaurant was elegant but I was glad of my wrap as it was chilly. The menu was easy to read and the food came quickly. I had tandoori prawns they were excellent' my husband had a chicken dish added to that we had naan and two beers. Everything was delicious, I wish I could have eaten more!The bill came to Sdollars 144.00 which included taxes and gratuity.The service was almost too attentive but everyone was very pleasant. I would love to go again and try more from the menu
5
This restaurant is excellent. The food is absolutely perfect. True, authentic Indian cuisine in an absolutely beautiful setting. High quality decor and an impressive selection of wines on display as you walk in.The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and had no issue with anything we had requested.I tried the Golgappa Platter (whole wheat shells served with tamirand and coriander water) - A first for me! Dal, Palak Paneer (my favourite) and a couple of other little dishes.The price is pretty steep but this goes with the territory being at Marina Bay Sands, and to be honest, everything about the experience at this restaurant was absolutely worth paying that little bit extra
4
had lunch here recently and opted for the preset lunch costing about 45 SGD, the taste and presentation was good for the vegetarian lunch but the non veg. lunch was just superb.
although a bit pricey but good for special occasions.
4
Very good service, tasty food but the price is quite high but you can't complain because of the location.
5
This is a great restaurant - as it should be given that it is associated with Jiggs Kalra who is an absolute food icon in India.The food is superb - - quite superb. Certainly the best Indian food I have had (and I lived in India for 5 years) and one of my most memorable restaurant meals. We had the 5 course degustation menu, which was lovely throughout and impeccably presented. Plus at S$95 per person, I think is exceptional value for money.Drawback - it's downstairs at one end of the MBS mall so there is no view at all; pity
5
Punjab Grill is one of the best indian food restaurants in Singapore. They managed to churn out very high quality, refined indian food which is of Michelin Star standard.Only thing was that there isnt a view and it is located at the far end of a mall. Would definately go back if I want indian food
5
Been there twice already and it's always a pleasure. Food is really good, try the samosa they are amazing. Service is excellent, people are really kind and give good advice on what dish to choose. Would really recommend to go there for a nice Indian experience.Ask for a table inside

fine dining ??..we are told that we should order all courses in 5 minutes as the kitchen is closing....then we dont get to sit at any place of choice though the place is almost empty...we get a diffrent steward , who assures us that we will getthe best hospitable service that they are known for...So he takes our order and then comes back to tell us that they have run out of stock in the kitchen...we order for Lassi...which he claims is their signature dish and insists that we try it...we almost throw up because the stuff is bad...over ferrmented ...he takes it back ...no apologies nothing...comes back with a different one...says this should be fine...it is bad ...but not as much...i found the appetisers OK...but my wife had an upset tummy through the night....the main course was fine too...the desserts ,,,they ran out of stock on what we wanted...at the end of it they serve you a "Pan shot" which is good and then shoot the bill...which is high...the decor and ambience is very ordinary....Oh i almost forgot....they want to give you a view of the kitchen....but you dont expect the whole kitchen to be walking in and out while you dine....all the folks working in the kitchen are in a hurry to wind up...so they make a ruckus and keep shifting things in and out of the ktichen through the sitting area...gives you a feel of eating in a well lit dhaba....not sure whether that was part of the sell for the place....about $200 for 2 adult and kids. , no alcohol...I am not going to any Punjab Grill ...there is nothing new here and nothing fine about the place...I think Indian food is over-rated in these tony malls...anything is dished out and priced way higher ...you get better food, better places for much lesser in the same mall..

My husband, 14 month old son and I had an early dinner on our last night in Singapore. I was a bit worried taking a 14 month old to a 'fine dining' restaurant at Marina Bay Sands, but the employees couldn't have made us feel more welcome. Our son was treated like a little prince. They supplied a high chair and kids cutlery. Unfortunately for us our son wasn't well so dinner was rushed, but we very much enjoyed our singapore sling, butter chicken and saag lamb. I tried the Phrini (rice soufflé) for dessert which wasn't really my cup of tea though
4
We went for a lunch and enjoyed the set lunch. Not a bad choice, good range of dishes, great dal, right size of portions. Overall good. They did throw in some curve balls like the liquid betal nut refresher and sorbet. But I liked the place and reasonable value for money
5
As a punjabi (north indian) myself, i can vouch for the authenticity of their north indian food.It is an expensive restaurant. But, with this quality of food and service i don't mind spending. Me and my husband went for their set lunch non-veg menu. So, we got to taste so many different things. Like, amritsari machi, murgh tikka, patiyala shahi machi, dal tadka, sorbet, desserts.....Each and everything we tried was awesome. From appetizer to main course to desserts, thumbs up to everything. Highly recommend. It is expensive so, one can go for set lunch menu and can try different things

I have been hearing about Punjab Grill for a while. Mostly about which are the best Indian Restaurant in Singapore. Punjab Grill is always on the top mentioned list. Finally I have a chance to try out this famous restaurant with my fellow colleague for a business lunch. When we arrive at the restaurant, the wall of wine caught my attention, what a nice statement that represent the status of the restaurant. Inside the restaurant, you can see the kitchen through a window at the back the restaurant. Nice little touch that shows you how your food was prepared. The ambience of the restaurant is quiet and cozy as compared to the MBS bright light setting. It is perfect to have business lunch where you can have conversation while enjoying the great service. There are many foods that day. We had more than 10 courses meal. Here are some of the foods that really steal my heart.Cheese garlic Naan – Although this is not the first time I had cheese prata. But I really love the creamy saltiness taste of the cheese. It goes very well with the dips. Chicken and almond soup – A normal looking soup that turn out to be the wonderful surprise of great taste and starter. The soup is more creamy based and it really kick-start my appetite.Tikka Platter – This is the wow factor that you will not get in other place. There are 3 type of dish on this platter. Salmon Tikka, which is the signature of the restaurant, chicken Tikka and Lamb kebab. The food is presented in a very modern fine dinning style. What a nice idea to put all three great dishes together where you can enjoy these signatures Tikka and grill food. This is a must have if you come here.Foie Gras – I was very surprise that there is Foie Gras served in Indian Cuisine. This show the creativities of the chef to create fusion food yet keep the traditional food great. The Foie Gras was served with a mini naan. And it was really good.Lamb Biryani Rice – When we order biryani rice, I was not expected it would be serve in such a fine dinning style. The Biryani Rice was served with a nicely decorated plate with grilled asparagus and yogurt. Just when I thought that all for the biryani rice, the waiter served us with the dal and my favourite butter chicken. These combinations really make me a happy biryani man. The waiter will ask you if you need a top up for your rice or butter chicken. More chicken please.Finally the meal ends with the 4 in 1 dessert. What a delightful sight when the waiter places the dessert in front of me. These desserts really make a really happy ending meal for me. I am very impressed with the meal. This is a place where you can confidently bring your business guest who wish for some local Indian Cuisine. I will surely come back here next time

Came to Punjab Grill for a business lunch recently. It was a first time for me at this restuarant, which is tucked away at the end of MBS Shoppes, located the opposite end of MBS from the Helix Bridge (in case you need get your bearings). MBS is huge and you can get lost looking for this restaurant. The restuarant has a mini open concept, where you get to see the chefs prepare the food in 3 tandoors (ovens): 1 for breads (naans), 1 for vegetarian dishes and 1 for meats. We tried a variety of dishes and the standouts were:- Mushroom and Almond Soup (Good! They served a hot soup bowl with almonds and poured the mushroom soup at your table.)- Tawa Scallops (Scallops were nicely marinated and great tasting. The scallops were served atop shot glasses and they resembled the MBS towers)- Foie Gras with mini naan (very good!)- Tandoori Salmon, Lamb and Yoghurt Chicken (Salmon and chicken were very well marinated and had great taste!)- Lamb Dum Briyani (Rice was soft and tasty, which went well with the lamb which was cooked with the rice)The staff introduced the dishes when the food were served and they were well versed with the menu.Overall, the experience was great and will definitely be back for more

On my husband recommended that we take our friends from Shanghai to eat here on Saturday night. Best recommendation he's made since marrying me!We went for the set menu. Its five courses and filling. Very filling!The food was well prepared, well presented and tasty. The service was excellent and understated. The best comment I can make is that most of the tables were occupied by Indians

I had the pleasure of dining at Punjab Grill this afternoon. The quality of food and the presentation was excellent as to be expected from a fine-dining restaurant. I was most impressed by the staff who were very knowledgeable about the dishes and could answer my questions about preparation methods and make recommendations. In the end we order platters for sharing and the staff took great care to introduce each item in the platter when we were served. Service is very attentive and more importantly unobtrusive. The interior design is contemporary and rather cosy which is good as some Indian restaurants tend to overdo the ethnic touches in the decor. The prices are not cheap but I would say they are reasonable for what you get; actually would say that you get more than you pay for. It was a great experience and I can't wait to go back for Sunday brunch the next time I am in the area

I tried the Singapore outlet as I am a huge fan of their restaurant in Mumbai. I found the food to be good, and the setting very nice. Menu is almost the same as the restaurant in Mumbai. Service is a little slow (you will struggle to get a business lunch in), though the food was good
4
The food presentation and the taste was great. The service was good and fast. The lemon sorbet which was given in between meals to refresh the pallet was an excellent thought.The item which sealed the deal for me was the 'PAN SHOTS"...i mean its so innovative...you get the taste of pan without having to dirty your hands or mouth...Overall a good place for special occassion ...be ready to fork out lots of dollars..
5
The restaurant definitely to be praised for the quality food served here,,, a must try is the 5 course chef tasting menu which have all the speciality down the line coming in a perfect corer seThe way the food is served starting with amuse bouch and also having breaks of sorbet which keep ur palate ready fr the mainsI paired my food with a bottle of Australian Shiraz and not to forget the impressive wine list having all price range of wine well matching the foodIn the end would like to make one lineMUST DINE IN FOR SINGAPORE GOURMET INDIAN DINING

There is no shortage of good India restaurants in Singapore. Based on a recommendation I went to the Punjab Grill in Marina Bay mall for dinner with a colleague visiting from China. The restaurant decor is modern and very comfortable. We were eating early and so the place was empty. All the same what struck me was the excellent service level. The staff took their time to explain the menu and were very attentive throughout. We went for the set menu at S$95++. This is made up of 5 delicious courses. The quantities were modest so you work your way through enjoying the different tastes and textures. Outstanding was the kebab course. Made of a piece of tandoori salmon, a marinated lamb chop and a spiced king prawn. All were very fresh and were 'melt in the mouth' tender. The main course dish is made up of lamb biryani plus black lentils, a chicken curry and a white fish curry served with a mixed bread basket. Overall this was really spectacular food combined with perfect service. Of course it comes at a price. But for a special occasion this is a must try place

We used to love dining at Punjab Grill at Palladium, Mumbai and were hoping for a similar experience if not the same. Our first experience here about a year ago was that of insipid food. However we returned after six months hoping that the previous experience was an exception. But that was not to be. The food taste and quality had the same consistency - it was boring and dull and it lacked the freshness and taste which is what appeals about the original Punjab Grill. Understand this is running out of the Shoppes, so it has to be pricey, but where's the quality? We are not visiting again
3
I went to this restaurant for a official dinner. Its a good fine-dining restaurant. I personally liked the food though a few of my friends found the taste to be average. The BBQ we ordered was quiet nice, butter naans and channa curry was strictly ok, chicken samosas and bhelpuri as the starter was something really worth trying, Prawns were a little stiff to my taste and so was the Biryani. Do try their Zafrani Lassi (a little too sweet for the taste but I liked it). Falooda Kulfi was just OK.The ambiance is nice, but there was a strange smell in the place which i couldnot place with anything. Service was nice, they kept serving us throughout the dinner and similarly the flow of food was well maintained. Served one dish after another, instead of piling everything on the table. Only at the end, when they asked us to fill the comments card and the waiter kept bothering us for additional feedback which kind of interrupted the discussion we were having and was a little annoying.On the whole, the place is a little pricy (S$70-80 per person, ours was higher but we ordered a little extra due to Ramadan) but I would recommend trying for special occasions
2
The Punjab Grill is badged as a fine dining experience, although the food was very good it was not outstanding and we had a very disquieting experience with our order which was dealt with very badly, leaving us disappointed and unable to recommend the restaurant to any future travellers. First off the décor is very pleasant the staff very attentive, in fact the attention is almost overpowering, it seem every time we finished sipping our water or took a mouthful of food a member of staff was immediately on hand offering to refill our glass or plate. I suspect this attention is expected as normal on the Indian subcontinent; it is perhaps just something I am not used to in European and American restaurants. Our food was good, we had chicken curry and chick pea curry with rice and a garlic Nan, all was presented very well and in adequate portions (we were however not that hungry).The big problem was that when my wife took her first forkful of food not only did she fish out a piece of meat covered with sauce but also a very long hair (five to six inches long). The attentive staff immediately came over and took the offending hair away and displayed it with a mixture of amusement and quizzical looks to the other staff. However, the only reaction was to ask if my wife wanted a new, clean plate. Not really the reaction we expected, if they think they are fine dining I would have at least expected, as a minimum, a senior manager to come over and offer apologies. Understandably the experience somewhat tainted the meal and whole experience. It left the impression that there was not real “management” in the restaurant, just cooks and serving staff, certainly nobody in authority who was interested in making amends for the obvious poor hygiene standards and lackadaisical response. I do not think I can therefore recommend the restaurant to any other visitors to Singapore. As others have commented the prices are expensive and given the many other options I do not think the overall performance deserves a future visit

The restaurant serves best of indian cuisine,with sharp service and personal care
No doubt its pricey but you pay for the worth price
Would suggest if you are looking for a best food with indian cuisine this is a place to be

Ok, first of all this review is done keeping aside the cost of the food, its too expensive, but if you ignore that part, the place is amazing with great food and great hospitality.Everything that we ordered tasted amazingly different and great. The chutnis and pickles they provided were very innovative and novel and yummy :).They offered some customized non-alcoholic shots of fruits etc and they were great too. The service was very good and pampering.This place is amazing, great location, great food, great service.A definite reco...

Ok, I admit I love Indian food and I come from the SF Bay Area which has a large ex pat community with excellent indian food. Having said that, this food was extremely disappointing. Forget the price (very high $71 for lunch). The food itself was not intersting and really not flavorful. I got the tasting menu which came with three bites for the appetizer and none of the bites were very interesting. They were food but not exciting. The main meal was more of the same. The naan was the highlight of the meal.This restaurant is another one of the celebrity chef's that are throughout the Shoppe's
5
Had one of the best Indian meals ever and that too in Singapore. Each course had a lot of thought given to the taste as well as the presentation and I wish more restaurants in Delhi would learn from the treatment given to dishes hereThe platter of starters was excellently done with special mention to the Salmon Tikka. Must taste the Salmon here even if you dont take anything elseThe curries were also par excellence and my personal favouraite was the Saag gosht even though my companions were all gaga over the butter chickenEven the dessert platter was done very nicelyAll in all a very memorable dining experience

Went to Punjab Grill MBS on an weekend dinner with few of my friends,the place was buzzzing like anything..!!We were recommended by the Server to Opt for their Degustation set menu.It looked a wide variety to taste but we wanted to taste maximum we could so decided to take it.The exotic gourmet dining began with a amush bush - compliments from the chef which was yummmmm came on a twisted fork followed by a golgappa shot...!! The server explained us in such a way that i could not wait to taste n it was hmmmmmmm....!!!!Next came the almond flavored chicken soup-i loved the way it came from a tea pot onto ur table..!! Just tooo good .The next course came a lovely tempting platter of grilled appetizers,the salmon was cooked to perfection, prawns were juicy while the chops were mind blowing.Never ever had such combination of grills..!!!!By this time we were mostly full but my taste buds did not want to stop..!!! Next came the a pre plated main course, accompanied with their smooithhyyyy butter chicken-the best dish ever had-I fell in love with their Butter chicken & Daal makhani..!!! I almost cleaned the bowls they were served in..!!!Here the server was very much involved in assisting us with some lovely facts behind the recipies-I wont share this as you must visit and find out from your Server. Till the time we had desserts , I was ready for a wonderful nap as I was very much Full with the last 4 courses.The two highlights were the wet tissues and the Paan Shots- liquid Paan...!! Was just too needed after such beautiful & mouth watering meal.Congrats to the chef & the over all Punjab Grill team-God bless u all- keep getting such lovely culinary dishes for your Food Lovers....!!! My experience was worth to see me back at Punjab grill soon...!!!

Had dinner with a few friends. This place is VERY EXPENSIVE. Even restaurants in Manhattan are way less expensive + way BETTER food. You are better off going somewhere. The mall where this place is located is fancy so that is probably why they rip your eye balls off with the check.
4
Went there to celebrate a birthday and were impressed by the food and drinks.Paneer and Salmon tikka were top notch and the lamb chops were the best we have ever had.Butter chicken and Daal were very very good as well.Cocktails were perfect and the overall experience was very good.Would have been 5 stars but for very average dahi ke kebab and Gol gappa platter ( I make them better)Service was attentive and helpful Will be back soon to try the dishes missed on this occasio
3
This place did not come close to the expectations. Claiming to be a fine dining place, the noise and the smell/aroma were a big put off. The food tasted good. But then the good taste was not uniform in its dishes. Some were good while some were really not upto the mark. Given a choice, I would not go there again
5
This place is located In the mall but it is by far not close to a food court dining experience. It is neru nice and clean. Wait staff is very polite and at your every need. They go above and beyond your expectations by explaining what everything is. Atmosphere is beautiful. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants a unique experience or in the mood for an Indian cuisine.
4
Went twice both the times opted for executive lunch. The thing which stands out in my mind was that it was a lot of food, most of it was pretty good, but the menu was overall very middle of road conventional including the options listed in a-la-carte; the butter chickens, tandoori tikkas nothing to make it stand out from a huge crowd of Indian restaurants many of them do a pretty decent job of churning out this kind of food.The lunch all inclusive was about $50 roughly twice of what one would pay for such a lunch but the number of items was also double of a conventional set lunch..The ambience and service too was 'above average
4
The awesome food blunted the shock of the huge bill. Service was great and unobtrusive. Well done! Perhaps a second branch in Singapore outside the MBS would be better
5
I came here for dinner after a member of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel recommended it to me. I was not disappointed, I had the 5 course degustation and was amazed at the presentation and taste. I went in a bit earlier to avoid the rush as it did get quite busy.You could see that the restaurant catered for all occassions, whether it was business, pleasure, family or just 1 person having a wonderful meal. The price was a bit high, but the quality of the service and the food more than makes up for it, I will definitely be back there next time I am in Singapore
3
I went there with my friend when we were looking for some good place to have food after a really long and tiring day at office. We saw few places but this one looked quite nice and we decided to go in and check it out. One bigger reason to go there (and to convince my friend to go too) was that I am a Punjabi guy myself and anywhere and anything that relates me to Punjab, I would love to give it a try. We were not very disappointed with the place's ambiance as it offers a good, rich and modern look. The staff was prompt to offer us a table and also gave suggestions about food. We ordered some north Indian dishes and the taste was good. The portions were of right size. The only thing that we sort of didn't like was the price as we felt it's on a high side. May be it's because the place is already made up like that so this much costing is okay. But for people like me who are out for business trips, it's not a place where we can go daily as it would be making a deep hole in our pockets. But if you are going out there with your family or for some business meet, it's a good place and the food is also fine. So at least once, you should give it a try
3
I was there on an evening for a business dinner.The restaurant was empty and a lot of staff stood around. The were quite nice and looked after us quite well. Therefore they deserved their tip.The food was okay, but nothing to write home about. We ordered different veg and non-veg dishes, that were recommended also by the waiter. Overall the price was quite high for what we got.The athmosphere is modern but if you are in there alone, it was not that great. I can imagine that it will be much nicer, if the restaurant is well filled with guests and you hear the noise of many conversations around.Over all it was an okay experience - but not great
4
The risk that I took to choose this as the venue to celebrate my brothers wedding anniversary, even after reading the uninspiring reviews, really paid off. Had ordered power lunch(S$40++) and a bottle of MoÃ«t Chandon (S$220). The lunch was packed with surprisingly revolutionized starters (mango sorbet, musk melon in vanilla shot, gol gappa etc.) and deserts(carrot halwa, litchee ki tehree, chocolate cake). Had dal, roti, a dish of chicken and mutton each for the main course which was "yummy". Great service, great ambience. Overall, a great place to spend time with your family
5
We have been here twice and definitely this is one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. We tried Ala carte and buffet on each of the visits and the food was delicious and well presented. The cocktail drinks are again a notch above the rest. Surely would recommend this place if you want to try Indian food for a special occasion. The interiors are grand and staff service is excellent
4
If you happen to be here..be ready to indugle in calorie rich food lots of ghee, butter and nuts.I am a regular over here and I think there food preparation style is unique. I have had daal makhni, paneer tikka, lichi ki tehri and shahi paneer here..all the paneer dishes are out of the world..paneer melts in mouth! but I must say best thing about this restaurant is their paan shot which is liquid paan..I liked it very much..very unique and tasty. all this comes for a whopping cost offcourse, it is pretty expensive restaurant. but you will not regret I am sure
5
Visited Punjab Grill during my last trip to Singapore and I was amazed at the food . Coming from Delhi which is the hub of North Indian food including the original Punjab Grill chain, I can safely say that I have not seen Punjabi food presented and tasting better than at Punjab Grill in Singapore. Prices of the menu did look a bit high but considering the portion sizes, they were well worth it. This has become a must do place for me now. Kudos to the whole team for such a fantastic experience !
4
One of my favourite place to eat Indian food all the way from Delhi. Singapore branch keep up to the quality of its Delhi cousin. But one of the most expensive Indian eatery in Singapore. Their lamb seekh kebab, kadhai paneer and dal makhani are a must try Would love to visit again and again
4
This place has some of the best Indian food I've tasted. Wide menu variety, full and subtle flavors, cooked very carefully. The only problem was the service, although well-meaning, they seemed short on staff.1) I called on a Friday evening to get a reservation later that night (called around 7 pm). Nobody picked up the phone.2) Decided that the place was good enough I'd try just showing up to get a table. I got there at peak hour around 8.30 pm (same Friday) and couldn't get a table until 9.30 pm.3) Sat down, ordered, and didn't get our food until about 10.10 pm.I'm still pleased with our experience. I would just try making a reservation days in advance next time
5
Authentic Indian food , with spices that India is all famous for. The food added with the Indian hospitality makes the evening rememberable
3
We are regulars at the Punjab Grill restaurant in Bangalore, and when we got to know about it in the Marina Bay Sands, we decided to have lunch there.The decore and service was good as expected. And the cuisine represents the north-western frontier of India.The taste of the food was not as good as the indian unit, maybe because they have to cater to a global clientele and need to tone down the tastes to suit their palate. Secondly, its quite expensive as well. Cost us about 85$ for a meal for 2 without drinks. But the pan shot in the end is a fabulous addition which we always love. Don't you miss it if you pay a visit
5
My boyfriend and I were in Singapore for only 4 nights and dined in this restaurant for 2 nights because the food was so good. Pretty much everything about this restaurant is great, from the ambience, to the setting, the service and the quality of food. We especially had a great and attentive waiter who made our dining experience very pleasant. I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone

Had heard a lot about this restaurant and decided to try it out with friends.As another reviewer has rightly mentioned - "The main course at this restaurant doesn't come close to the North Indian food that you are used to in Delhi or other parts of North India. It feels like you are having Indian food but you simply cannot place the type of Indian food that you are having."The only thing good in this restaurant are the starters. Everything else is not worth the price they charge you for it!"We were served some lime juice drinks as part of the set menu - but it was full of sugar and very average. When we asked for one without sugar, they got us one, but we were surprised to find that it was charged to us as separate orders in the bill at S$ 8 a drink !We went for the fixed lunch menu which apparently has only one serving of the starters - which were very good - kebabs - but repeat servings of the main course which was a big disappointment. Hence got a very small portion of the good stuff and repeat servings of the stuff that was not very good.The Butter Chicken curry was bland to say the least. The spinach lamb was ok but just did not have the PUNJAB or north indian flair to it. May be my expectations and those of my friends were a bit high - we expected BUKHARA (ITC Maurya Delhi) style food but were very disappointed indeed.We Four friends had our fixed lunch menu followed by 2 of us having coffees and we came out spending over S$ 230 and nothing to write home about. It was meant to be a lazy lunch discussing world affairs :-) while enjoying great Indian food and it turned out to be a hurried ...never again....type of experience with the inconvenience of going all the way to MBS fro lunch.Sorry but just had to be a bit frank as this was too disappointing overall
5
Located in the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, the location of Punjab Grill is beautiful. The modern Indian fusion style menu is flavorful, well presented and portion sizes just right. The ambience and service was great. They served us with complimentary appetizers and a betal leaves after-dinner drink, which much to my surprise was delicious. Never thought of using betal leaves in a drink! I will definitely go back next time I visit Singapore
5
Yes, it is not cheap, but then if you go to MBS, would you expect it to be? The presentation, the spices (spicy but does not burn your mouth), the service, the size of the dishes, everything was thought through and well done. Still my favourite Indian place in Singapore. I just wish they stay open a little longer in the evening
2
During my transit from NZ I decided to try the Punjab grill had heard a lot of good stuff about it.,we reached for lunch though we were seated promptly the ambience was laid back and service reasonable I cannot say professional as the drinks I ordered was served after a couple of reminders that to after the arrival of my kebab platter,I had opted for a kebab special was disappointed as no one explained what kebabs were served to me also the bread(garlic nan) was served with chicken birayani a combination which was not accepted from a authentic Indian restaurant ,though the good part was the vegetarian fare ordered by my guests I just wished I had done the same......it definitely cannot be rated as fine dining,and with what it charges it is disappointing
5
I must say this restaurant was a wonderful suprise. We stubled over the restaurant on a rainy shopping day, and the food blew us away. Our lunch almost became dinner, we didn't want to go. And the staff gave us a great service the whole time. We reccomend this in all ways.
5
As we Indian are very fond of Indian food and always hunt for it where ever we go, yes off course even on Antarctica ;) so this time while in Singapore we wished to eat in Indian food, as we were shopping in Shopper's at bay i knew that there is Punjab Grill by Jigs Karla, so we went there with some of our friends...the ambiance was very good, so were the staff polite and prompt. The ingredients used were very high quality i must say which made the whole food more tastier, Amritsari fish was really tasty, fresh catch. soft and succulent , so has Aloo Pratha perfectly soft and buttered, and my most fav. Panchratni daal is still dominating my dreams :) very tasty and expensive experience but worth and i will surely go there again :)
5
I have not had Indian food presented and tasting like this ever. The tandoori prawns and lobster were awesome and the paan shot at the end of the meal was a mind blowing innovation. The prices looked high but considering that the staff was courteous enough to tell us that two portions of each dish would be enough for the 8 of u, it's good value at the end if the day.Service was a tad slow but it's still very courteous and doesn't take anything away from the overall experienceWill be back here for sur
4
Good sized portion and delicious food in a luxuriously decorated environment. The kitchen with the huge tandoors is visible.
5
My wife and I dinned at the Punjab Grill while staying at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. We were reccomened an Northern Indian mushroom dish that was simply delicious, but expensive. Good attentive service.
5
Fantastically good food and service. Have not had better Indian food anywhere and this food is worth traveling to singapore for.
Must Try the butter chicken
4
Nice Indian cuisine, slightly expensive but was worth the money as we were looking forward to indian food, the appetiser were water balls (gol gappa) shots which was interesting, the food was very nice and definitely as per Indian taste standards.
5
I went with my family to celebrate my daughter s birthday and it was a fantastic experience and the way we got the service and the quality of food was excellent. Thank you Team Punjagbi Grill ... Keep it up your good work.

Had heard a lot about this restaurant and decided to try it out while I was in Singapore. Judging by the name and the location (Marina Bay Sands),you would already have guessed that this is one of the most expensive restaurants in this area.The main course at this restaurant doesn't come close to the North Indian food that you are used to in Delhi or other parts of North India. It feels like you are having Indian food but you simply cannot place the type of Indian food that you are having.The only thing good in this restaurant are the starters. Everything else is not worth the price they charge you for it

its very difficult to find a good indian restaurant in foreign countries and this places serves you lip smacking food just like what you would have eaten in India.Though a little on the expensive side but still worth it.Do try the Kabuli Chana there :
3
So here's the thing. I have eaten at four different Punjab Grills now; three are in India, one in Singapore. In India, this is one of my favorite restaurants and I look forward to going every time I'm there...and I'm never dissapointed. The food is excellent and the price is reasonable. I had seen the Singapore restaurant being set up the last time I was there, and was excited to give it a try. This time it was open. So I did. With my wife. Who thought it was great. And it WAS better than good. But it wasn't as good as the ones in India. And it was VERY expensive.Six pieces of chicken in my Butter Chicken. Five pieces of Panner. A piece of Butter Naan. Rice. Bottle of Water. $120S. I know the rent in Marina Bay Sands is not cheap, but the pricing of this restaurant alone has left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Even compared to a couple of other high end restaurants in the Marina Bay complex, where I have also eaten. If you have money to burn, this is the place. If you want Indian food every bit as good as this or maybe better, a lot more of it, better variety, all at less than half what you will pay here (for lunch), take a quick taxi ride up to Tanglin Mall and go to Yantra for their lunch buffet. You will leave feeling you just made a fantastic discovery, and save at least $70S in the process! Enjoy
5
This was a amazing place , we had dinner there in a group of six , and I must say all of us enjoyed a lot.The vegetarian menu has a special item by the name of gucchi , which is the most expensive vegetable , usually used in Kashmiri cuisine , it is a type of mushroom for our knowledge , although we were reluctant to order a new item , but we were really glad as most of us liked the delicacy , a must try if you are a veg and want to try something more than paneer and aloo etc.Another highlight was that the dahi ke kebab , as a goodwill gesture they served us 6 pieces , although the usual portion size is 5 pieces.They also served some complimentary condiments and papad and chutney along with the meal.The portion size was justifying the higher price , but in the location and for the quality and portion size , I will say it is a worthwhile price point
4
One upmarket restaurant that serves authentic Indian cuisine in the luxurious mall of Marina Bay Sands....elaborate choice...interesting ambiance...service quality and staff behavior are good too...food served are delicious..and close to authentic...only the pricing need a second thought.... a dinner with drinks for 16 person cost 2K SGD....half of the group did not have alcohol !!

It was tough to rate this restaurant. Overall it was not average although Very Good was a bit generous.If not for the Marina Bay Sand location, this would be an average North Indian Restaurant. They have done well to make the open space table arrangement attractive but you soon realized that you were seated underneath an escalator. But connoisseur of good food can be forgiving on matters of location and seating arrangement in search for good food.We visited the place for lunch, and the crowd was not there yet although there was an exhibition going on. We ordered the mix grill and the Dum Lamb baryani. For titbits we were served papadum with 3 choices of dips. The grill was generous: lamb, shish, chicken tikka, chicken tandoori and fish. In my opinion the spices were overly done, thus losing its finesse and natural taste. The same comment I made, with the lamb bariyani. The flesh was tender and fresh but the bariyani gravy nad spice was a wee bit overly done. The Rice was superb though. Above average would be the rating for the food.The two of us could not finish the servings although I did not have breakfast. The serving was generous.The bill came to a whopping SGD 120.00 with just mineral water to accompany the food. You would pay less for the same food and ambiance in NEW YORK CITY. No complaint had the food been the finest North Indian I have eaten
3
I was very disappointed with the food --- the quality was average and the service was like we were in a so-so restaurant. Given that Singapore has so many really good Indian restaurants, I'm surprised this earned its spot in MBS. There was no particular dish that stood out or worth mentioning. :( And I was appalled when during dinner, someone that looked like a dishwasher or delivery service walked right in the middle of the restaurant! Don't they have back service doors??
3
Tried the Set lunch in Marina Bay Singapore , disappointed in terms of Taste n Variety! I guess for the same price or even cheaper, you have better buffet options with much better spread n Taste

The many reviews on this restaurant will clearly show that this restaurant has got the most amazing menu and food on offer. Their variety is truly innovative. I have been to this place on multiple occasions over the past year and although I still think that this is the best thus far, I think the service standard is slipping. 1. The service is not as professional as it should be in a classy restaurant like this.2. The set lunch menu - again while the food is good, it is too heavy!3. My last visit was in late October for a business lunch and when we reached there we found that there was a very stale smell in the restaurant, probably from the air conditioning which needed some maintenance but it clearly put out my appetite.Living up to the reputation that this restaurant has created is a tough task and I just hope that the management takes note and puts in that needed effort

Was lucky to visit this place during a recent Singapore visit. Start to end everything was great. The menu selection, service, presentation and taste. One or two items from menu does need a mention- first one is black daal - its one of the best I had after the famous ITC Grand central daal, another one was sarson ka saag & makke ki roti. We tried full course- starters to dessert and none of them was less than extra ordinary and more importantly, all were real authentic Indian dishes- outside of India!!!Service was very good: server was very helpful, knowledgeable and suggested some good combinations. Each item was presented in very good manner and portions were also large enough to serve a group of people.All in all it was a great dining experience..

Ha the pleasure of a meal here on the last day of our stay at marina bay sands and it was a truly wondrous experience. A must visit place And my only regret iS that we waited till the last day to dine here. Would have loved to taste what we could not in our one visi

Once you get past it's quirky mall setting under the escalators, you enter a glamazone of monster chandeliers, open kitchen and waiters dressed like an army. Although the website touts a menu of "lost" ancient recipes, our meal was more traditional Northern Indian food. Fantastic chicken cooked in butter, cream and spices and dhal Makhni served with garlic naan. Next time I would try the grilled seafood we saw our neighbors eating. As part of a promotional dinner we were comped a glass of red wine (nice!). Service a bit spotty but overall a good contender for top Northern Indian in Singapore

We were greeted at the door by their friendly manager and with all tables booked inside, we sat outside under the mall elevator. It was a pleasant setting nonetheless. Our waiter was diligent and took our order promptly which included tandoori duck, murgh makhala curry, garlic naan, rice and two glasses of wine. Meals were delivered quickly and food tasted delicious (though the duck could have been more tender) but the challenge for us though was that we had experienced these flavours at half of the price on other occasions (singapore dining overall seems more expensive than our comparison - Sydney). Don't let this put you off though as the experience was enjoyable.

Thoroughly enjoyed the lunch set menu, starting from the ginger drink, starters, main course and through to the desert. Service was ok, but food was presented well. Food was delicious and liked the surprise sorbet before the main course and paan concoction to end it all

We now usually check the review before we go for holidays after our bad experience with our trip to Desaru beach resort. After reading the reviews we went to MBS to have our dinner. We had very good dinner and the service was excellent. Initially we thought the price was high but the taste of food, the size - big portion nd the service makes us satisfied. This was my son belated birthday party so we discussed between us, to our surprise before the bill we got small chocolate cake for my son as complimentary. This surprise has no value as per me. Salmon tikka, tandoori chicken nd the Raan was excellent , we had very good seafood pilaf. To the end we got pan shot and the birthday boy had two glass

We called in on the spur of the moment for dinner on a Monday night. And whilst the food was excellent, vegetarian platter, saag ghost and garlic naan, it was quite expensive. Service was very good, atmosphere and setting was very nice.

Superb food and service. A must visit place. The butter chicken is just yummmm !

Awesome food. Probably the best Indian meal I have had at any restaurant. This place is a must do for everyone

Great indian food. Great service. Must visit for fans of north indian curries and vegetarian dishes.

We were a little reticient to try another fine indian restaurant after our experience at rang mahal but the kids wanted butter chicken and we were overuled - and Thank God for that . Punjab Grill was one of the finest Indian meals I have had with all the dishes being excellent. The Raan and butter chicken deserve special mention and the paan shots were a lovely touch at the end. Highly recommeded !

After reading all the great reviews we tried this place. Nightmare is putting it mildly. The place was totally disorganized. We ordered drinks and they took for every as the waiter was also the person making the drink. We ordered dinner........ and then began to notice people getting served who had come in after us. Finally the waiter came and asked us what we had ordered!!! Really at this point we have been in the restaurant for 30 min. As we were leaving we could see dishes stacked on the bar and general disarray. I can't comment on the food as I didn't have any. Great disappointment. We were there on a Sunday night which may have been the problem. If so close on Sunday'

This restaurant is located in the ground floor of marina bay sands. the location is very good and is a fine dining restaurant .the food served here is very good and presentation of food is excellent. the only drawback of this place is that the staff is not very helpfull and very slow. the price of food is on the higher side
4
The food was really good however one of the members of the staff was downright rude. He made a mistake with our order twice and had the nerve to rub it in our faces saying it was our fault. When you pay so much for a dining experience and come across waiters like that, it completely ruins your whole experience. For that alone it was a complete let down

Am a big fan of JK's restaurants, so was looking forward to going to Punjab GRill at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. I must say I was a little disappointed. While there was nothing wrong with the quality of the produce and cooking style, it all seemed a little life-less. The effort seemed more in line of making all the dishes heavy and buttery, rather than elegantly flavorful. I am a punjabi and realise that punjabi food is noted for its robust flavors, but the same can be done in a much more subtle and healthy way, which will make the patrons really love the food, instead of just liking it. If you're looking for a nice heavy punju meal, this is a good place. If you're looking for a fine dining experience to please the senses, this definitely isnt it, even though the prices suggest the same.Special mention to the Amritsari machchi, which was very nice

I'm a Punjabi and I consider myself a foodie. When I entered the restaurant I was a little sceptical as I feel too many people like to cash in on 'PUnjab' brand. But the food was too good to be true. Dal, butter chicken were all good but the highlight of the day was Sarson ka saag!Even the non-veg starter with the meat and all were we'll prepared. A must-go

we were in Singapore on a business trip in the first week of march this year.It is almost an every year affair. Though I have been to singapore umpteen times the search for the best Indian Restaurant never ended. This time we came to know that Punjab grill has opened at the marina bay and straightaway headed to it. We were extremely happy and satisfied with the experience there with both the quality of food and hospitality. Though the food was rich and heavy we could not help overeating since it was so tasty. We thanked mr. Jigs Kalra for launching this great restaurant in singapore. may god give him a long healthy life

Would not recommend this compared to other Indian restaurants in Singapore. Average quality food while highly priced.

they serve best biryani that i have ever eaten... all paneer and vegetarian selection is just too too good.. bad side: i have been eating so often that i am starting to wonder if the weight i have put on is attributed to punjab grill :

Our meal at Punjab grill at marina bay sands was truly one of the most memorable Indian meals I have had. The starters were excellent in themselves but it was the curries which truly stole the show. We had the butter chicken and the fish curry ( I forget the name of the dish ) and both were truly outstanding specially with the mirchi Parantha recommended by our server

One could have worked more harder to present a place complimenting the cusine.The experience og Bangalore got us to celebrate here.Half the menu revolves around 'paneer.The service,food presentation and service is average for the price you shell out! The biryani tastes like pulav.I am a foodie and could not take this let down

I had read so many good things about this place that I was looking forward to eating there. I was a little disappointed in some ways but other ways it was OK.The dÃ©cor of the restaurant is very good but the music is loud to the point of being intrusive.There are a lot of staff visible in the front of house but I doubt that is echoed in the kitchen because from ordering to delivery of food was a good 45 minutes.We ordered the lamb chops which were outstanding, the leafy green vegetable curry which was interesting, the chicken tikka masala which was pretty average really. The biggest disappointment was the tandoori lobster, this was pretty bland and dreadfully overcooked to the extent of being rubbery. The naan breads and popadoms were excellent.To the credit of the restaurant one of the waiting staff asked me for my feedback and I made only two points, the inordinate delay and the poor quality of the lobster which they promoted as a signature dish.Without being asked the restaurant provided a very nice dessert and also deducted totally the cost of the lobster

I had been a little apprehensive about going to Punjab Grill even though a few colleagues had raved about it since I expected sky high prices at marina bay Sands.Got a chance to try out the place during restaurant week with their $40 lunch offering and I am really glad I went. The food was really top notch - certainly the best Indian food in Singapore at the moment. Perfect grilled starters followed by a very nice butter chicken and bread basket. Didn't really have room for the desserts after that. I was also glad that i went because I discovered that they have a usual $25 and $40 lunch and I will definitely visit again since its only 10 mins from my offic

I agree with the people who are calling this restaurant the new gold standard for Indian cuisine in singapore. In fact, being an indian living in singapore for close to 15 years, I don't think there is anything remotely close to Punjab grill at the moment. I have tried their lunch set menu more than a few times now and they have wowed me each time. And the paan shots are an excellent innovation.

Undoubtedly 'Punjab Grill' is the Finest Indian cuisine Restaurant in Singapore. After placing our order, we were served with complimentary veg kabab piece. 'Singapore Sling' was not the best but then they do not claim to be best in this area! We started with Paneer Tikka and it was the best we have ever had. Tenderness, crispness, flavours were just right. Tamatar Shorba added to the experience. In the main course, Malai Kofta continued the great experience. However, 'Sarson da saag' lacked original taste, little surprising from a 'Punjab' Restaurant. Paan shot at the end was another pleasant surprise and very unique. Service is amicable. However, ambience could have been better for a restaurant of this category.Overall a good experience and worth trying out once despite high price

This is a true blue must do for vegetarians. We had their $40 set meal (veg) and I have not seen better treatment to food then the tandoori broccoli, tandoori mushroom and the zucchini the only regret was that after the starters , we couldn't do justice to the mind blowing saag

An altogether excellent dining experience. We have many great Indian eateries in Singapore and this one just entered the big league in our collective opinion. A must do for Indian food lovers.

We had heard a lot about it and booked a special sat nite to try !The food was hardly any super taste or even presentation was poor !The atmosphere was not fine at all. Very average and uncomfortable table & seating. The table was so narrow that it could not hold the servings at all !The floor underneath our table wAs dirty and had food spilling probably from the earlier group.The icing was the service. Havenot seen a service as worse as this. The waiter didnot have time to take order. Or explain the menu. He was a restless / sweaty chap with no patience at all. And no sense of service at all....we felt worse than a highway dhaba.Yucky feeling overall with very moderate food, a sweaty, super busy looking waiter, who was only serving our table, but looked as though we were wasting his time, each time we discussed the order, while he stood. Almost like, guys decide first and then bother to call me !Not recommended !... Go to yantra instead

Way overpriced. Food is just ok, service is variable, no atmosphere. Don't know how they survive when there is so much excellent Indian food in singapore.

Went there with family to celebrate my wife's birthday. Overall, i would say that the food was decent but definitely not worth the hype...The quality of food was good but not great...the starters were excellent but the main course was a bit let down....we ordered different curries and most of them ended up tasting nearly the same...ordered a few Indian drinks (lassi, jal jeera atec) and about 50% of the drink were just ice cubes. This restaurant very clearly caters to foreigners who are not always aware of how really high quality Indian food tastes.Overall its a good place to go if you want to take out clients or just celebrate an occasion but dont go there purely for food...there are better options in SIngapore at about 30% less price

My husband and I are both North Indians and we love punjabi food. That is why we were very happy to see the familiar Punjab grill from New Delhi open up in Singapore. We found the location a bit hard to find at it is tucked in one corner of the huge MBS. Although we had reserved a table inside but we decided to sit out in the lobby as the inside was quite crowded with large groups even on a weekday.Since we had come straight from office we were hungry and ordered the maincourse directly along with the drinks. My hubby ordered a red wine but it was not to his taste so he settled for a Corona instead. I ordered a bellini and it was quite flat and too sweet. However the restaurant offered us complementary small tikki each made of potato and peanut which was yum. It was crispon the outside and very soft and mildly flavoured inside with very distinctive peanut flavour which i liked. They also served papads with the assorted dips which is a standard fare in any fine punjabi dining restaurant. But the papads and the mint chutney were very fresh and tasty. Then they served our maincourse for which we had Nalli Lamb and Paneer Lababdar. Our hostess was very helpful in describing the dishes and helping us pick our selection. The food was out of this world!!! The paneer was very soft and the creamy curry was delicious. (caution for people who cannot take too much chilli want to request for less spicy paneer). The lamb shanks were meaty and cooked to perfection. The breads were crisp. They told us they fly in the ingredients fresh from India and other places. Asked them for refills of dips and onion slices and they gave us generous portions. The portions for maincourse were also quite big so we could only eat half and packed home the rest. The prices are a bit high but I think the food is worth it. They also offer some very good lunch deals as well. Indian food is known to be heavy and diffiult to digest and this place is not exception. So only go in for these dishes if you have the stomach for them. It will be a taste that you will remember. I look forward to the dinner of the mind watering leftovers in my fridge today

We had heard a lot about this place from friends and decided to try it out for V-day night family dinner (2 Adults with 2 kids). I can now tell from personal experience that this is indeed the food to beat in Singapore when it comes to North Indian (Punjabi to be precise) food in Singapore. The location is a bit odd - tucked away at extreme left corner of B-1 in MBS Shoppe area. So please park in open air parking at the beginning of Harbour Front Av and enter from the side entrance to MBS Shoppe (rather than main entrance and then get lost from there on inside the vase expanse of MBS) . This way its just a short walk from car park.For starters we ordered Paneer Tikka and it was superb - succulent Paneer done over charcoal with a VERY distinct smoky aroma. It didn't have any of the usual heavy coat of masala on it - nor was it served with Onion and green chutney -instead it was served with Grated Beet root and salad leaves - very classy indeed.For main course, we stayed with what is perhaps the signature veg course here - the Sarson Ka Saag (with Makke ki Roti) and Daal Punjab Grill (with Butter Naan) and I was blow away with both. These are very common dishes and yet they managed to impress. The Sarson ka saag was specially awesome.The portions are large and we were glad that we didn't order any side veg dish. We still couldn't finish it all (they would have gladly packed the leftovers it if wanted them to).We were too full to order any desserts and the small bag of chocolates that the house captain gave us on leaving was just perfect way to cap the lovely dinner.The bill will pinch you if you are not ready for it though, so be ready :-

This place is a must must go for all lovers of North Indian Food, In fact even for people who don't yet love North Indian food because after dining at Punjab Grill - you surely will fall in love with the food.I tried the Tandoori Jhinga for starters and I have not seen better treatment to Tiger Prawns. Also tried the Tandoori Lobsters and the Salmon tikka and both were excellently doneWas drawn to the place again for lunch after the first experience and I tried their set lunch. That was as excellent a set meal as I have ever seen. The butter chicken and the desert platter is a must try.The service is good which after the experience at rang mahal was a refreshing change.Just go and try this foo

Having heard highly of Jiggs Kalra, we visited Punjab Grill. We had the non veg kebab platter as a starter. The kebabs were tender , well cooked and delicious . The sheekh kebabs (awesome...) melted in our mouths. After we were through with the starters, we were served raw mango sorbet (with roasted cumin seeds sprinkled on the top) to neutralise the palate which was very innovative and effective. We had ordered murgh makhani (butter chicken) , lababdar paneer and a bread basket for the main course. The lababdar paneer was excellent with the paneer very soft and melting in our mouths. The curry base for the same was different , creamy and delicious. The murgh makhani also had the right amount of spices. All the dishes were not too spicy or over-rich. We were too full to check out the desserts. We were then served as a mouth freshner, in shot glasses, a mixture of pan and vanilla icecream which we thought was a great touch and very innovative indeed... The service and ambience was impeccable. In terms of shortcomings, salad and lemon slices was not served with the kebabs . And we felt the bread basket could have had more variety. The pricing is on the higher side , but worth it

One word awsome... I am a Punjabi and of course I have been to loads of punjabi places to eat in my life, from $10 per head to $150 per head. This will be in my top 5 best. It is expensive but it is well worth the treat, Book before you go or you will be offered the outside seating, which isn't too bad... Can't wait to go back and have those tiger prawns... :-

Went here with my wife for our anniversary dinner. Opted to go ala carte....was expecting this to be expensive but having dined at other 'fine dining' restauarants in Singapore before, this was worth every dollar! Portions are large, quality of food and presentation was world class and service was impeccable. Paan shots blew me away :
