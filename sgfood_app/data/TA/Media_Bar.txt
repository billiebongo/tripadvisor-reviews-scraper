Food is superb,it was well worth it.The dish was executed perfectly,and the service is good.Though i would love to be selfish and keep media bar all to myself but the work of the chefs is too good to stay hidden for long.There's no doubt a table in there will quickly become the hottest reservation in tow

Went there with my girlfriend as i got to know the place from a friend. As i arrived, the place is nicely furnished, cozy and quiet as it wasn’t crowded (prob cuz i went kinda late). Service was excellent, servers was friendly and polite. Constantly checking if we need anything too which was great. Food came quickly, not only does it look awesome, it taste superb. They have a wide variety of drinks to choose from and the prices there are fairly cheap and affordable. Overall great service, great food. Would definitely visit again! (

We came here for the burgers, which are a generous portion size! Tasty (but not the BEST burger I've ever eaten). Service was good as well. It was a fairly quiet place for a bite and a drink on a Friday night

Great ambience, not crowded. Service was good. Food portions were very small though taste wise it's quite delicious. Enjoyed the experience in this place for the very first time!

Visited the restaurant a couple of days back for lunch with my better half, and the place was very lovely. It was a pleasure to have friendly staff welcoming us too. Since it was our first time to try out this place, the staff helped with deciding on their dishes, which turned out to be an awesome meal at the end! The main course we picked were Salmon and Mushroom Resotha which was well enough for both of us! I would definitely try out their dinner very soon as well! Thumbs up for everything at this place

A quite bar. Its perfect to have a nice drink to unwind after work. A very pleasant outdoor sitting. Got to meet the Beverage manager and got great insights on the various spirits

Visited in March 2017 with my wife and came back again due to the good food & service. We tried the new Executive Set Lunch and it was really value for money for a 3 course set lunch for $17.90++ and the quality of the food served was excellent. Service staff, Aishah came around regularly to check on us as well as the outlet Manager, Andrew though they were busy. The environment is nice with designer decoration and good to hold company lunch as well. Saw the new ala carte menu which have more variety now but due to time constraint, we have chosen the set lunch menu.Will definitely come back again & recommend my friends to this wonderful gastropub, Media Bar. Keep up the good work and I m sure, it will be packed everyday in the days to come

Fantastic service, fantastic food and drink at great prices. The staff could not do enough. A great place for lunch or an after work drink

Beautiful setting, gorgeous lights, splendid tables - everything we wanted for a bachelorette party. To top it all - fantastic service. Chef Dharma and Manager Jaq redefined service standards and turned it into an evening worth remembering for years to come, as they carefully attended to our table of 11. The happy hour was totally affordable. I was absolutely thrilled to be there and am looking forward to return. And oh the convenient parking space :-

Aisha and her team is always so welcoming and warm. Great service and good ambiance! Good variety of bar bites and drinks

We were here for a drink with friends last week and their staff are very warm and accommodating. The roti prata roll is really good. Their happy hour is worth it too
5
The place was so relaxing and chilling! I tried the 1 for 1 beer for very reasonable price and had a glass of whiskey as well! Aisa and the assistant manager Jaquelyn are so knowledgeable to make recommendations and so attentive to my table. And do not forget to order their chicken wings too, the flavour so good and the portion is good for sharing. Prices are very reasonable, will definitely come back to this place with friends and family!!

Good ambience of bar, food and drink nice, friendly staff,especially bartender Zhi Hao.Will go back again!

My new fav weekday set lunch place!This is my 2nd visit after 1month ago and I arrived to see the increased prices. Obviously still an absolute steal at $17.90++ for 3-course still nonetheless. A salmon starter, a choice of main from 3 (including a vegetarian choice), and a dessert. The starters both times were salmon by down tastefully, mains selection was the same (I had the squid ink vongole both times), and the awesome chocolate parfait is now apple crumble. Service was superb both times, with the chef offering to redo my salty pasta and complimentary coffee as service recovery. The place is classy (what else do you expect from a JW Marriot?) and a quiet gem away from the crowds. Portions are small though - so take note.

I've been here to this bar few times already. .Ambiance was perfect to relax. .Service was great. special mention to Aisah and Jaq for being friendly all the time. Come here earlier to avail the happy hour promotions (1 for 1 ) for all hourspirits and beers.I'll surely come back to this bar.

Quiet in the week end, more busy in the week. We went on Saturday evening. There where not a lot of customer sadly. The service is very good. The drinks too. Food taste great, it's like high fast food/finger food in a way. A bit pricy compared to what I expected but quantities are decent. I recommend the onion rings. Best I have so far, and I recommend the duck confit croquettes. The place is designed by Philippe starck so quite a good an unique ambiance, with a warm and homey feel.

Went to Media Bar for their Executive set lunch. Ambience was great with New York style chic decor and relaxing vibe. Great service from staff - attentive but never intrusive. Food was DELICIOUS - Chef appetiser (cold tomato soup which was surprisingly really tasty), Pasta Garganelli with beef cheek ragout and shitake mushroom, and finally the signature mini apple crumble (they added pomelo which added an very interesting layer of flavour). All for $15++ which is really good value, considering the location. I initially thought the portion would be too small (based on some reviews), but it was just right. Enough to satiate your appetite but not too much to give you post-lunch comatose. Will definitely be back!

Started off with this nice cold tomato soup followed by main course pan-fried Seabream, ratatouille, semi dried tomato and the lovely mini Apple Crumble..yummy! The service staff, Yadav and Aisah was attentive and prompt. Food was served without delay. Kudos to the outlet manager, Andrew who is also attentive and professional. He came by to say hello to ensure everything was in order. Will definitely come back for the good food and service rendered. Thank you and keep up the good work

My family and I went for lunch on Sat, 25th March. The ambience was great and Lighting in the bar was just right. We had the executive set lunch, comprising of an appetiser, main course of either - eggplant lasagne + toasted sourdough, pasta tagliolini squid ink + vongole + basil or the marinated kampong chicken breast + olive crushed potato + asparagus and the dessert, chocolate parfait. As there were four of us, we tried all the three courses.The appetiser was simply delightful and refreshing as it was chilled! The main courses were mouth-watering and the portion is just right for the ladies. And the dessert was simply heavenly!A very good hangout place with your girl-friends or business associates, and very value for money

Media Bar is a classy bar/restaurant. Seating is available both inside and outside. Service is professional and friendly, atmosphere pleasant. Had the lunch set menu on a weekday which is good value for money. Food is very good, albeit the portions are quite small and hence might not be sufficient for a good eater
5
Been there twice so far. Once with friends and the other with family. Service is really good and their executive set lunch is really worth it. Flexible also when I requested a different appretitizer as I had the same the day before. The male waiter was especially nice and kind and gave a complimentary ice cream to my kid. Thumbs up and will definitely recommend people here!

After a long day of walking, finally a cozy place with easy food, good music and awesome staff.Definitely recommend to anyone passing through looking for a quick bit to eat and enjoy drink cold beer or good variety of win
