The food is great without being special. But the location near the causeway is spellbinding. Very pretty spot

Food is average but the location is special. It's located on the jetty. Nice sunset view of the causeway during evening time. The service could speed up a bit.

The food is good and very reasonable. Will be nice if the wall is a little lower so that when you dine you can see appreciate the sea view.
Make sure you reserve on a weekend.

Food are salty and the hot plate toufu is not hot! Satay eat while it's hot otherwise it turns very hard very cold! Not worth to visit even if their service is good.

I decided to hold a dinner there to celebrate my mother's birthday. We ordered Set Menu 4 (caters for 10 pax at $208+) which we chose:- 3-Flavoured Fish- Cereal Prawn- Golden Pipa Sauce Chicken- Fried Baby Squid- Hotplate Seafood Fried Tofu- Sambal Kangkong- Seafood Fried Rice- Tom Yum SoupFeedbacks given were that the Cereal Prawn and Tom Yum Soup tasted somewhat less than average. Tom Yum severely lack of Tom Yum taste. The rest of the dishes were on average taste.On the other hand, I personally liked the Snow Mountain Mango Tango although I find it slightly too sweet.Total bill was $308.It is located along the jetty. After eating you definitely have to take a chill and enjoy the cool breeze.In conclusion, I would say the outlet's counterpart at Choa Chu Kang park offers better quality in their dishes. I would only recommend coming here if you're looking for a casual dine on the ala carte menu

After an exhausting walk from the Woodlands Checkpoint area in the heat of the hot sun we decided to have a snack here. The waiter was very good bringing back a preorder list that we had given him to make sure that all was correct before serving. A nice touch considering the various accents and languages spoken in Singapore. I had fish and chips, my wife had a mushroom omelette with a side portion of french fries. Both were cooked to perfection. In fact the chips were the best I have tasted for a long time. I actually pinched some of my wife's they were that good. This was followed by a double scoop of ice cream shared by us. For drinks I had a Coke Zero and my wife had a black coffee Total bill a very reasonable S$28.01. The restaurant is on a jetty so you are actually sitting between Singapore and Johor with views of the Johor Strait.We will be back

Located at the Woodlands Waterfront, this restaurant has the view of the sunset. Came here for dinner just before the sunset. While the food itself was only average, the service is pretty good and fast. We had all the dishes we ordered on our table within 15 minutes. That's pretty impressive.
