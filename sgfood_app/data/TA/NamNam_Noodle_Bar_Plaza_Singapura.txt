We had the Pho Beef and it was as delicious as it looked.
Tasty and tender, service was rapid and staff polite, a very tasty lunch!

Was hoping for a nice cup of authentic Vietnamese coffee but what was served was nothing close; it was bad. It was watered down, flavourless and did not even have a hint of the usual aromatic Vietnamese coffee! The fried banana however was good.

Actually ate at this location and Suntec city. Food was really good at both places that’s why we choose to eat at NamNam again.I had the chicken Pho lunch deal with vegetable spring rolls and a Vietnamese black coffee. Extremely good value and very tasty food. The pho was very good and the whole meal was very filling. Would definitely go bac

Lived in SG 7 years, the menu looks nice, but the service creates an unpleasant environment.Almost all their meat dishes have pork or chicken, and they wouldn’t substitute any meat (no exceptions therefore, I didn’t place an order while my wife ate - staff didn’t seem to care). Also, another server seemed very unhappy to serve; not sure why as we had no prior interaction with her, but she was outright rude. Unfortunate, as I live literally next door, but seems like I’ll need to travel a bit further for a meal

We tried the fresh prawn rolls, spicy minced meat pork ball noodle and beef ball pho. They were all very good but when you taste the pho soup, you can’t help thinking about how much sugar and other flavorings are added. There were many patrons who ordered the bahn mi. We would love to try that next time. The food is worth queuing for!

Chanced upon this restaurant above Dhoby Ghaut MRT Station, and as it was about 9.30am, the special breakfast set was at a really great price. Paid about $6 for a meal of vegetarian banh mi and lotus flower tea. Both were very good! My wife loved the beef pho.Service was quick.

I love variety of ingredients and my default would be the mixed beef pho ($11.50) with sliced beef, beef balls and tendon. Love everything in the big bowl. They are probably introducing a new appetiser and I was served a complimentary portion of rice flour rolls with dried shrimps and fried shallots. Very yummy and I would definitely order it if I see it on the menu next time. I don't mind helping myself to the cutlery counter as I am happy not having to pay service charge and GST here.
