Food is good but slightly on the pricey side as the ambience is not worth the cost. Place is rather small and dim.

Quite a fine place to do two drinks. Pleasant view of the water and park connector. Interiors are rather chic.
Generally good food and quality service. Can't complain.

Is a nice place with some toys and swing for the kids while the adults chill out but the service is really bad probably due to the shortage of staffs. And the place is pretty stuffy, aircon is not strong

Relaxing, great location, great service and comfort food. Staff is very friendly and location is kid friendly.

A very nice place to chill and chat with friends over drinks. Food was all right. It will be good if the restaurant can have better wet weather alternatives as we were wet from the rain.

Beef lovers got to try this! Their Beef Ribs are to die for! Simply melts in your mouth.You may also up size any of your main course with baked bone marrow which was cooked to perfection.Fish & Chips sounds boring but their batter crisps even after half an hour later. Fillet was really fresh too!All 6 of us enjoyed our dinner.

A beautiful location, great for evening or sunset watching (bring sunglasses!) Food is typical bar food: wings, chili fries etc. Service is good. Would give four stars except for ordinary food. If they could fix that they might have a winner

Quite chilled for Singapore. I didn't eat, but nice place for a quiet drink.
I will be back for beer and food one day if my wife gives me an exit Visa.

It's off the beaten track and not many people know about it.
It's worth the trek though, as the food and service is good. And it's good value.
If you are in the area, recommended for happy hour drinks and burgers.

This is one of these hidden gems.. Located at Passion Wave, 11 Rhu Cross you enter a nice and cosy restaurant / bar. At first you might think that it looks kinda small, but once you reach the terrace you understand what i mean. Brilliant view of Marina Bay, The Singapore Flyer and last but not least, its along the water!Place is under the same Management as the HandleBar, so you can expect its biker, pet, kids, family friendly.Food is great, drinks are great, people are great

The atmosphere of the restaurant was quite cosy because we were able to sit outdoors and watch the sunset and admire the lights from the CBD. The wait staff were very prompt in providing us with menus, taking our orders and serving the food and beverages. The must-try dish is the Blossom Onion - each strip is fried to a crispy finish without tasting too much of the oil. Definitely worth the expenditure

Very yummy ribs that were juicy and tender and full of flavours. Generous portion with lots of fresh salad greens. Quite under-staffed so we helped ourselves to the sauces from a shelf near the kitchen. This is a casual dining place and you can see that everyone is at ease. We even started a conversation with the diners at the next table who were commenting about how nice their burgers were. Nice view of Kallang river outside but was a hot day so we stayed indoors

This is a fun and friendly place. Excellent for a break while enjoying Marina Bay and a walk/cycle/skate/scoot round Gardens by the Bay East. Good food - American, good and unusual. Funky upmarket sport bar vibe inside and outside tables with fans, greenery and the bay outsideThey try to do your food to order as well, which is not very common.
