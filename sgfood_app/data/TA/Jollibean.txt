Really love their peanut and red bean pancakes - very generous fillings and chewy pancakes which are quite substantial as a snack/light meal. Personally think that their soymilk is not as robust-tasting when compared to Mr Bean though.

I grew up with local soft tofu with sweet arnibal syrup and sago. So when I had the craving for the same, I had to go to Jollibean. Not exactly what I was looking for because the syrup is much different and no standard sago (it was add-on cost). But it had to do. At least the silken tofu was similar.I recommend 2 items to refresh you: the soya milk (get the cold variety) and the soft tofu (hot one). Good light snack. They got other items on the menu, but those are for my next visit.

I am referring to the Jollibean branch in Paragon. They have a wide variety of foods, such as different flavours of tofu hua which are refrigerated that we can pick. They also sell different flavour peanut cakes individually, and also assorted mini packs. I would have to say that the peanut one is always crunchy, and not too sweet. They also serve soy yoghurt in cone or cup. I always picked the cone one. It is not too sweet. However, for those of us who have cold womb, would recommend that we eat only once in a while only.
