The food is great and easy to share. A must try is the Kimchi Carnitas Fries. This is a place I will visit again.
5
Brought a Friend here. They liked it so much, they're coming back next week for more queso and tacos
4
I love the food here. Seating was a bit tight (close to other guests). Waiters could have been more attentive, but once an order was taken service was fast. Only on item on the dessert menu - would be nice to see more.
4
Food is above average and price is rather high yet the atmosphere is good for friend gatherinv and celebration.
5
Food was really good. Interesting to try the Mexican-korean fusion. I have burrito bowl and Kimchi Carnitas Fries for share
4
This is our 4th visit and the food is fantastic as always.
Highly recommend the fish taco and burrito.
Probably not the best place to catch up with friends as it can get quite noisy.
4
Ive been here a few times and trust me, this place is always busy and it‚Äôs really hard to get a table especially during the weekends so I suggest you make a reservation beforehand. Food and drinks are a bit pricey but it‚Äôs worth it as the food are sublime! Pork belly tacos, Baja fish, Galbi short rib and Just cheese are too die for! And oh don‚Äôt forget the Tamales. Wash it all down with sexy sanchez (strawberry margarita) or the gold digger (apple margarita
4
My wife and I visited with no reservation on a Saturday night and sat at the bar. Service was fast and our burrito bowls were outstanding. Mushroom fajitas were also good. We are staying at the JW Marriott this week and Vatos it is just a stone‚Äôs throw from the hotel. Would definitely return.
5
I have had so many varieties of tacos from all over the United States, but mostly from the Southwest U.S. Vatos Urban Tacos' tacos with an Asia twist were as good as they get. Medium in size so less filling, but the flavor and texture of the many varied fillings are unbeatable. You won't be disappointed
5
Carne Asada tacos and Margaritas were on point, I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor of the tacos, the quality of the guacamole and chips. Staff was friendly and very attentive to patron needs. The margaritas could have been stronger but, couldn‚Äôt they all? Overall great little spot not far from a lot of tourist attractions
4
Korean pork rib taco is very nice! Beef burger is just normal. Should only order tacos. Good music in the restaurant.
5
The set lunch at $19 is great value. I had the chicken salad wrap, fries and virgin margarita. The herbs and vegetables were fresh and the chicken cooked just right. And the portions more than generous.
4
Good food and a very wide variety of choices. but not so great service. Staff abit slow to responses
5
Good quesdillas and tacos. Value for money too. Nice place to chilla and quite kids friendly. Pork short ribs taco is gd.
4
Free appetiser. Tacos were pretty good and not that expensive. Serves Mexican sodas as well. Mexican cola tastes better than other cola.
4
Enjoyable visit to Vatos Urban Tacos. The food was good, but portions were small. Enjoyed their specialty tacos and the ambience
4
This may be my 7th time here and the food is just as good. Galbi tacos felt a little less than usual. Still taste so good. Props to management for sorting out payment issues that we had.
4
Nice ambiance, good service, interesting and tasty fusion food. Only drawback was that portions were quite small. Slightly pricey too.
5
Food is always pretty good here. It's filling so order accordingly because i always end up having to pack things home. Drinks are great but my favourite part is the ambience. Waitress was a little rude, but didn't affect my dinner too much. Usually the service staff is top-notch
1
Very rigid policy. You are either a happy hour customer or normal hour customer. You cannot order more after happy hour at normal prices
4
Loved the tacos - all flavours recommended on the menu. The kimchi fries can be a hit or miss, everyone loves it but i found it quite mehh. The makgeolita was gooood. üíØüî•üåà
4
Delicious tacos. Cheese dip with tortilla chips was awesome too. Service was so so. Overall ambience is good.
3
The food is unquestionably good, not so for their service. Squeezy seats and rowdy ambiance. Having said that, the food is the only reason that made me kept coming back.
5
The food and ambiance was great. Its a good place for a group get together.
Used entertainer when i came here but they were having a 3 for 2 tacos Tuesday as well.
4
Food is indeed very flavourful but because of the uncomfortable seats, we have to give this place a miss in future.
3
If I wasn't using the entertainer app, I would have probably found the food too pricey. Was also disappointed that using the entertainer meant we were not entitled to the happy hour drinks.
5
nice ambience, good food, cosy place, love the chicken wings as usual, nice drinks. tacos are good too.. brought my foreign friends to this place to try korean mexican food.
5
This place is really good. We went there for lunch. We had tacos and our friend had a quesadilla. The food was great and reasonably priced. The margaritas were great as well and our friend had a micro brew bear that he really liked.
3
The place was having Korean-Mexican-Filipino Thanksgiving party with Iskina Cebu. The place was packed but lucky I had made a reservation in advance. We were showed to a high chair table by side. The place was quite noisy with tables spread to the walkway as outside was raining.Chimichurri Lechon Tacos (S$15++/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu lechon, chimichurri salsa.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. Jalape√±o Pork Belly Lechon Tacos (S$15++/ 2 pieces)Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu pork belly lechon, pickled onions, jalape√±os relish.The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy. I‚Äôm Rick James, Peach! (S$30++)Frozen Peach margarita + Tecate BeerThe margarita was served in a glass with the beer bottle upside down. It was not too sweet. Oh man I was red like a peach after having the drink. Didn‚Äôt get to try the roasted chicken which was also that night special item as it was sold out by the time we placed order
4
If you have been to Singapore you know that it is an expensive city. Vats Urban Tacos feels like a casual, neighborhood restaurant. We had various tacos, all were tasty. Didn't try the kimchi fries, maybe next time. Quick and efficient service. If you are hungry order more than just 2 tacos, I will try 3 next time
4
What a mix! Brilliant concept with great food as a result. Tacos are delicious and the kimchi fries were tasty. The melted cheese dip was pure heaven and oh so naughty. Slightly pricey but a good location right above the Esplanade mrt station.
4
Nice Korean and Mexican fusion. It was delicious. Service was good as well and atmosphere was perfect.
4
The restaurant serves delicious Taco's! Price was slightly on the expensive side but that's to be expected for the location. Overall very enjoyable dining experience. Great for gathering after work. Beef taco was especially good!
5
Food was awesome, enjoyed everything we ate. The kimchi carnitas fries and tacos were great, highly recommended!
4
I visited Vatos on a wednesday night and it was surprisingly crowded for a wed night.
Had some korean mexican infused alcohol drinks and food. Highly recommend the alcoholic drinks as it was special - you won't find it elsewhere.
5
A few nights ago, I intimated (to my husband) that my pregnant belly was craving for seriously good Mexican. And since I've been to Se√±or Tacos a few times already and wanted a bit of change, we decided to try out Vatos. Supposedly high-rated in Korea where it's originally from, we had some expectations of the place. Thankfully, Vatos did not disappoint. We booked a table and because it was Friday night, we were told to arrive on time as they can only hold the table for a few minutes for us. Inside, the restaurant looks nice and well-appointed. It's a charming mix of intimate (must be lighting and proximity of tables) and cool; the music not too loud so people can still have conversations in between bites. They provide complimentary starter - some crisp with three different dips. We ordered salad, tacos (if I remember correctly, I ordered the spicy chicken variant) and quesadillas (pulled pork, I think it was that my husband ordered) to share and they were all very good - and the quantity more than sufficient for the two of us. Price-wise, it's a little bit more than what you'd normally pay for in other Mexican joints in SG, but the price really doesn't take away from the fact that the food quality, service and youthful vibe of the restaurant deserve top marks
4
In Singapore on a mileage run and staying at JW Marriott South Beach. Vatos is in the same complex as the hotel, so I thought I‚Äôd try some Asian tacos. It was ‚ÄúTaco Tuesday‚Äù so buy 2 and get 3 tacos. I tried to get 3 different tacos, but my server told me that all three had to be the same kind - so I went with Chicken Chimichurri. The tacos only took 3-4 minutes to arrive and they looked delicious. Looks weren‚Äôt deceiving- they were quite tasty. ‚ÄúChips‚Äù (actually whole fried tortilla) and salsa were good as well. Had a pale ale that was quite tasty as well, but not worth the S$15 it cost. I would return here for the tacos anytime - just wish I could have mixed it up with a couple different ones.
5
We have previously had bad experiences with Mexican restaurants in the Asia pacific region. With some skepticism, we sat down here. We were pleasantly surprised. The salsas tasted quite good and very similar to what we would get in Mexico. The service was very nice as well. The restaurant is conveniently located near several large hotels and businesses
4
Being from Texas you get the need to find nachos, not just any nachos but beef nachos, with cheese, guac, onions, jalape√±os. We're talking good nachos. Finally found it here on this trip.Now it does say that it serves two and the staff even says, yes it is a good portion. Guess they don't get to many Texans in for bed and nachos. They serve one. Don't get me wrong they were great and the beer selection just added to the experience. Now we did finish the nachos and we're looking for more, so we got a couple tacos each to finish off our appetite after walking around the city most the afternoon.If your not interested in nachos, the tacos will fit the need. Great atmosphere and if I worked in the area I would probably be coming down for a happy hour or two during the week.Everyone's taste are different, so check them out for yourself. Enjo
4
Went with a bunch of 10 friends. The food was amazing, although the staff seems a little short-handed during their dinner serving. I love how they infused Korean food into Mexican food. Definitely worth a visit for the taste of the food, just that it's quite pricey, especially their drinks
4
Variety was great and magarita's are the bomb! Only issue I wish the chairs had back rest for me to sit long. Was only able to sit 2 hours straight before I became restless. Otherwise, great dining experience.
5
My family visited to celebrate my father's birthday. The place is very tastefully decorated, and the food is divine. We had the kimchi pork quesadillas and surf'n'turf bowl. Both were amazing.
4
Food is good. Would recommend the Shrimp Tacos which are fresh and crispy. However the tacos are slightly pricey for its size (3 tacos for $17). It‚Äôs great that they are in Entertainer.
5
Superb time at vatos once again. We had a tiny fiesta ordering a bunch of stuffs twice. The music was weird that night - happy and Super sad
4
Ordered 4 different kinds of tacos. The taste is great and $110 worth can feed 5 people quite ok. Recommend the black pork tacos or if you go in pairs during the happy hour to get the 2 pints and taco set
4
My first visit here and really enjoyed the tacos. My friend and I both ordered 2 tacos each and we both really enjoyed them. Only complaint is the seating which are basically fancy stools. No backs to them so with a back problem, not recommended. Place got really busy. Must make reservations to ensure getting a spot. Will return to try other things on the menu or do takeaway so we don't have to sit on the stools!
4
Good Food. If they say Spicy - it is! After 3 weeks of Indonesia Food, this was a welcome respite! Good service - although it is a sort of "busy" place without a lot of quiet privacy, it does have good food if you are willing to try it! We (a group of 4) ordered a large batch of different tacos - they were WONDERFUL
4
Some of the servers aren't the greatest while some of them are great. One of them was fixing their apron as she walked passed me and had managed flap her strings across my face while I was eating. She did not know most restaurant procedure when asked a question regarding the promotions. Unfortunately I did not get her name.
4
Had a craving for Mexican food and decided to try Vatos. Bartender XT was great. Good service. Great margarita. Tacos were average. Taco shells were homemade but didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t seem right.Also had the Con que so. Great taste but a bit thick. Overall great service. However food was about average
3
We had the chicken and prawn tacos, as well as the Alben's frozen margaritas. They were really good! However the food took quite a while to arrive and the service was average. The place was also pretty dim and noisy, with tables placed very close to other diners.
5
Situated in the JW Marriott complex on S Beach Rd, Vatos Urban Tacos are Korean fusion tacos. Crazy Beer-ritas but my favorite drink is the giant Makgeolita. Guacamole is the best appetizer along with kimchee fries and I highly recommend the Galbi short rib tacos.
4
Had the Baja fish and Korean pork belly tacos. Generous servings. Also had the tequila wings. On its own, lil sweet but good with the blue cheese dip.
5
Great place. Margarita + Tacos! Awesome place with Great atmosphere. Go for short rib and pork belly. :)
5
Honey tequila chicken wings were seriously the best fried chicken wings I've ever had! Super tasty and crispy. Loved the korean po burrito wrap as well. Kimchi fries were not bad.
4
i visit regularly here and they even have taco Tuesdays. Good ambience and chicken tacos. One of the best I've had
5
Food was yummy! Drink was nice! I enjoy the ambience there. Great place for hang out with friends & family!
4
Service was amazingly efficient and prompt even though they were full. The tacos were so so succulent and delicious and drinks were so imaginative. I think I will recommend my next Christmas party again at this place. We had our Christmas party when they first opened and it was a hit with my colleague
1
Ridiculous attitude. Went there at 6:30pm for some drinks and snacks after work. 5 or 6 tables empty in the front with 1 occupied. Went to the host and was told that they were full inside and outside was not open until 7pm and that was also fully booked. Asked if we could get a drink outside until the reservations came but was rudely told we are not open outside even though there was a group drinking outside. When this was pointed out was rudely told to go somewhere else.Went next door had some drinks and food and noticed that there were at least two tables open the entire time we were at The Armory, next door. This place could be good. However, if they run their business like this they will never survive. I think they forgot that they are in the service industry. I take a knee when it comes to Vatos and you should as well.
2
As the review title suggests, I had a mixed experience with Vatos Urban Tacos. Great food but awful service. Vatos does a great job with Korean-Tex Mex fusion. One of my favorite New York street trucks did this. Anyway. My party shared pork belly tacos, spicy chicken tacos, kimchi carnitas fries, and honey tequila wings with some beers and one Makgeolita (makgeolli margarita fusion). Everything was excellent except the spicy chicken tacos, which were just ok. Maybe a little less onion on everything though? Can obscure the other flavors. The Makgeolita was a lot of fun/great flavor. Recommended. Unfortunately, the great food was offset by ABOMINABLE service. We waited 30 minutes and no waiter could even be bothered to come to the table to take our order. No water, no complimentary chips and salsa, no interest in taking our order. We only got water and managed to order because I got up, walked over, and got his attention. The waiter forgot the chips and salsa - Of course. Over the course of the night, I REPEATEDLY had to stand up and walk over to the waiter to get service. In a country where the service charge is automatically added to the bill, this is just INSULTING. Hawker centers have better service for free. Maybe it's a management training issue? I don't know. But whatever it is, right now it seems like Vatos is running a weird welfare program for slow witted and/or lazy teenagers. I cannot tell right now if the meal seemed overpriced because 1. I was compelled to pay for service that I did not receive or because 2. the portions ought to be larger or the prices lower. In the end, I'd like to go back. As I wrote, the food and drinks were really really good. The chef obviously has the recipes down. And I'd love to rate this restaurant higher. But the service would really need to change first.
4
Been to this place for dinner a couple of time and it's always buzzing, good service and great food. This time I came on a Friday for a business lunch and the place was pretty full. Food was good but the service was sub par compared to other visits, with a lot of staff running around but not being efficient. Would give this visit a 3 star rating but previous ones 4-5 stars so averaging out to 4.
3
Nothing really special about the food there. Fusion? maybe but nothing fantastic. There are other Mexican restaurants in town, definitely much better.
5
Must order the Chef recommended nachos, kimchi fries, prawn mango quesadilla & tacos.. drinks are instagram friendly too! thumbs up!
4
Interesting food concept. Their kimchi fries and short rib galbi tacos really hit the home run. The staff were really friendly too.
5
The food is excellent! The Kimchi Carnitas Fries and Honey Tequila Chicken Wings are a must have! My only gripe is the high chair, not the most comfortable experience if you are sitting there for long.
3
Something different if you want to try. but not for fine dining. casual dining and gathering with friends are fine.
4
Food is really tasty although they weren't served hot. There were 2-3 other patrons in the whole restaurant to about 7-8 staff but service was slow.
4
The tacos are so tasty. We had beef short ribs, Korean pork and battered fish. They are all good. The margarita portions are huge. Love it. Great place to hang out with friends.
1
The tired interior clich√É¬© of raw brick and black industrial piping is supposed to say "hip and urban", but Vatos lacks the fun and the style of other Mexican restaurants in Singapore. It's partly to do with under-trained staff, who look like they're having no fun at all.We waited an hour for food, only to discover that our order had been "lost". While we were waiting, we thought we'd have a beer from the lengthy and fairly expensive drinks list, but the first 3 we tried to order "weren't available". In the end, we did manage to order one, only to discover at the end of the night that it had been substituted for another brand without asking us, because the one we had successfully ordered also "wasn't available".And, when we asked to speak to the manager at the end of the night, apparently he "wasn't available" either, though he did send a message back with the waitstaff authorising a 10% discount. If you're hiring a restaurant manager who is afraid to face customers, you know you have staffing problems.Singapore have some very good Mexican restaurants. Vatos is expensive in comparison, and it's so badly run that it's really not up to the standard we expect here
5
Having just returned from Austin Texas USA and the vaunted Tex-Mex capital I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of Vatos Taco's. Try their signature Margarita with the Cowboy Queso - sure to please. Baja Shrimp and Fish Taco's then beef - all excellent. Not huge portions but sufficient and price is mid-range. Service and Quality - excellen
2
Came here 3 times and basically since the first time the quality has consistently gone down each subsequent time ive went. The food is no longer good and the service although never great is now pretty damn terrible with rude waitstaff that dont particularly care about the quality of your evening. On the plus side its still a popular place and the drinks although on the watered down side are still generous in portions
4
The food was great and nice ambience. The staff were generally friendly. I would recommend this place to my friends for drinks!
4
Everything was pretty good, except that there will be a stench following you after you're done with your meal at the restaurant. Your clothes will stink.
4
Quality korean-mexican fusion food. Do try the kimchi fries and quesadillas. Alcohol is a tad pricey though.
5
Great reservation with amazing food. They do the best mexican cuisine i know in town and fusion with korean is rly nice. Reservation system is on point
1
Great concept, terrible execution. The service is the worst I've experienced in Singapore at a restaurant of this type. Every time we needed anything (to order drinks, food and to request the bill) we had to go out of our way to flag down a server. When we were about half way through eating our starter one of the staff cleaned it without asking us (after I raised the issue they did remove it from the bill) and lastly when we asked for the bill the bartender took my card but then proceeded to eat his dinner before returning the bill and my card to our table. The menu is too ambitious and large for cooks that clearly don't understand Mexican or Korean, let alone the fusion of the two. The quality tortillas used in the tacos were poor to say the least, they were more like uncooked masa dough than proper corn tortillas.The drink menu is solid but ridiculously overpriced even for Singapore
5
The tacos were delicious ( we had veggie, fish and prawn tacos). The fish and veggie were our favorites! The chips and salsa were also good- excellent salsa- but a bit skimpy on the tortilla chips. The dessert ( they only have one) was worth it if you have the room! We also had the kimchi fries which were demolished by the non vegetarians in our group. The only complaint is the seats ( stools) are not comfortable... which was surprising to me given the prices here.
1
The poorest excuse for a taco that I have ever seen. The chef clearly doesn't know how to work with masa, to the point that I was actually embarrassed for him. The Korean tacos concept is wonderful, but Vatos totally misses the mark. Hopefully their Korea locations are doing it better! To top it off, it is way over priced. With so many options in Singapore, don't waste your time on this
4
atmosphere of restaurant was good. relaxing and chill, great place for couples and friends! chairs are not very comfortable so people might not stay long. drinks are interesting but huge, you may want to share! prices are a little on the steep side, be prepared to spend about $40 per pax if you order drinks
3
Have been wanting to try Vatos Urban Tacos ever since I came across this place on Chope shop. Finally decided to purchase the coupon from Chope and went! Had a average experience overall. Food was fine, drinks were quite pricey. (I guess because it was fancy.) Had to sit on high chairs/tables, did not really like it
5
I had celebrate my anniversary with my girlfriend and this place is super accomondating. They helped to receive the flower bouquet and kept until upon my arrival. Food wise is delicious. The tacos, quesildillas and the chicken wings are to die for. If only there are live bands on certain days and price of the food serve could be further reviewed, i think this place will make a awesome place to dine in
5
The food was really good and the atmosphere even better. The service was also good, the quality of the ingredients tasted fresh and nice and the different kind at options made it hard for u to choose. Totally recommend :)
4
Visited this place for a few times and I absolutely love their kimchi fries. Will always order it when I am at vatos. One of my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Just try to get seats indoor cause outdoor can be very warm.
5
Me and my son visited this place close to our Hotel...amazingly good tacos and burritos and Mexican cola...enjoyed it
5
Great atmosphere for a chilled night out with friends. Not too noisy that you feel you have to shout above the noise. Tacos and burritos were delicious.
5
The food, cocktails and service at Vatos were all excellent.
I highly recommend the Texas Tea and the care asada tacos.
4
It's the mexican-korean fusion restaurant. Speedy service and good vibe. the pork belly taco is one of the must-try dish!
5
Although the portion sizes were a bit small, the food was absolutely incredible. I have never been a big fan of fusion food but this was definitely something else. I had the pork belly tacos and they were very rich with flavor. Also split the fries, were quite delicious and was a huge portion but quite expensive. The menu had a lot to choose from so I will definitely be back for more
3
I wanted to try 2 different flavor of tacos but you can't order just 1. Has to be a minimum of 2 per flavor. Ordered the carne asada with no onion or hot sauce. Well apparently that's all that comes in them. I got meat on a taco with nothing else (cheese, lettuce, sour cream?). The meat was good, but plain. I also ordered the queso which was good. If I am back in this area I probably would not return to this restaurant
3
Vatos was packed when I visited and had a lively buzz with friendly staff. People seem to like the huge cocktails, which at many tables seemed to last diners throughout dinner from start to finish. The signature menu of Mexican with a Korean twist looked appetising but unfortunately three of the four dishes I tried were disappointing: cheese and sauces dominated all the flavours to the point that you couldn't taste the chicken in the taco or the pork in the quesadilla. The only highlights were the jalapeno spring rolls and classic margarita
5
Casual and fun. Favorite chain of Korean tacos. Located next to JW Marriott. Galbi and pork belly tacos are a must. Famous for their beer-Rita which is a giant margarita stuffed with a bottle of beer on top. I know you don't come to singapore for Mexican but if you haven't tried Asian fusion like this it is worth it
4
Place is near to mrt exit and has quite a few restaurants and bars nearby too. A good place to explore next time.
4
Tasty food with great alcoholic drinks selection. A little noisy but good location. Wait staff not very attentive
4
May not look like much but tacos came stuffed with lots of meat, even the carnita fries had a lot of meat in it. Extremely satisfying meal. Guacamole served with hot chips were awesome.
5
Major love for their kimchi fries. Serving was good. Go for the happy hour promo from 12pm-7pm for 2 pints of beer with the kimchi fries for $30. Very worth it! :)
3
Food tastes quite good and service is prompt, however; would advise restaurant operator to look into the ventilation as the smell stays onto the garments and skin after that. The price is slightly on the high price.
4
The atmosphere is pretty good, they have indoor and outdoor sections. We selected the indoor option cause my partner is always afraid of Singapore humid weather. Haha.Noticed mainly are bar table and tall chairs, they are extremely uncomfortable. When we requested to switch to normal dining tables and chairs, they told us it is all reserved. But weirdly we been there for two hours but those diner still haven't arrived. Though we wanted to stay longer to try out their drinks but due to the comfortable furniture we decided to find somewhere else.We ordered 3 types of dishes, can't remember what is the name of the spring roll... that is the best dishes among all. It is alittle spicy but the fragrant and texture it is indeed good.
4
Went to Vatos with my husband, we ordered tacos short ribs (superb!), kimchi fries and teaquila wings. Needless to say, their Tacos were awesome. Teaquila wings with blue cheese dip were exceptional too! However, i gotta say the portion of kimchi fries is a lil too big for 2. Prices are pretty steep as well. Kimchi Fries goes at about $19. Would be good if the fries can be cheaper with smaller portion. High chair seats without back rest were not very comfortable, so people with back problems may wanna avoid that seats.
5
The tortillas and nachos were so fresh, I could smell the steamed corn. The place always needs reservations, even on Monday which is telling of how good it is. Unfortunately it is a bit too noisy inside if you want to be romantic, so ask for a seat outside. Price is decent at $12 for 2 tacos, a bit on the premium side but still relatively affordable if you compare it to sashimi rather than sushi. Glad that they don't stinge on the fillings either
4
we ordered kimchi carnitas fries, popular choice here and for good reason, it was a spicy and delicious treat. Mum had a veggie burrito which was nice as well.good portion sizes (so much that you can order one main and one appetizer for two) offset the higher price tags. looking at the prices of drinks ($30 for margaritas , 20 something for a majority of drinks), we skipped and had Jarritos instead :Dcant say it's 'value for money's but the food is decent and decor is modern-casual
2
This funky mexican diner seems like it's going to be a fun place to eat during the evening. However, flagging down a waiter was so difficult you had to keep getting up to get one's attention. There are plenty of waiters there but evidently the web delivery orders were way more important than the customers. The food was nice enough, but the service was such an ordeal I'd never go back
4
Love the vibes of this place and the food is always good as well, variety on the menu is interesting
3
If you're going to do it, go for the burrito and skip the tacos. The selection of beer is incredible.
4
Nice food! Nice ambience! Good service! We ordered the peach and Apple margarita, complete with the guacamole nachos and taco!
5
Really relaxed and homely atmosphere with amazing food! Fresh and interesting fusion of Korean and Mexican cuisine.
5
Fast efficient service. Creative yummy food. The cocktails were fantastic. The menu is very creative. The portions are good value to the price. The atmosphere was fantastic. Is a great place to get cocktails
4
The foods are pretty good with quality ingredients. It's Korean Mexican fusion so I can't gauge if it should be tasty like Korean or Mexican foods. Enjoyed the happy hour special though.
5
Vatos is one of my favourite places to hit up with friends, due to its fairly-priced, delicious food options that encourage sharing. I visited again when they had a special tie-up with Iskina Cebu, the masters of lechon in Singapore. We had the chimmichurri lechon tacos which were super tender, flavourful and juicy. Hoping that Vatos has more of such tie-ups in the near future
4
Enjoyed the makeolita and the food in general - our favourites were the kimchi fries and fish tacos. Food and drinks are fairly pricey but the atmosphere makes up for it :) Husband and I brought our parents so it was an interesting experience for them - crowd's mostly young-ish (university students --> working adults
3
Was super busy so they sat us outside in the walkway no atmosphere , didnt bring us plates or cutlery had to go and get ourselves , meals are small but did come out quick .Drinks are way over prised cheapest beer was $15 for a small beer what a joke .Food was tasty but almost to spicy where you can't taste the actual food .If you want a good feed and 1/2 dozen drinks make sure you have a thick wallet 
4
Met with a group of friends for dinner on a Monday night. Not as crowded as the last time with my wife on a Saturday night. Ordered their kimchi fries again. Good deal on Mondays for the margarita... $12/serving. Tasty chicken wings but the mushroom n spinach quesadilla was only so-so.
4
Love the food and atmosphere. The pricing for food was fair. Drinks price are on the high side. Overall enjoyable. Will return
3
Visited for lunch. The restaurant does not offer a special lunch menu or set lunch. We had the tacos, they were nice. Service was ok. Restaurant is very dark and has more of a bar feel. Maybe more suitable for evenings. Overall, an average experience.
5
Yummy tacos and fusion drinks..wat more to ask. Only thing is that the drinks are a but steep. Other than that food and ambience fantastic!
4
Place is nice, more fore young people and groups than candle light dinner. Food is brilliant but costly tho. All in all, nice experience. Staff so so. Would come again.
3
The first few times I went, the food was amazing. The past couple of times have left me disappointed. The price has gone up and the quality of both food and service has gone down.
4
Great service, nice food!
Love the kimchi fries, other food was good too.
Nice place to chill out at night.

I think we reach there by fluke for dinner. I must say the food taste n quality is really excellent and if u like margarita must try here
4
Bought a $100 voucher from chope for $90 and had a very satisfying meal! The drinks portions here are huge so go easy and try to share if you are going in a group. Our makgeollita was more than enough for 2 persons! I also highly recommend the Chilli Lime Prawn Taco and the Baja Fish Taco. Skip the Pork Carnitas! :
4
A casual bar vibe that is good for large group gatherings, friends, family and even couples. Food was generally good and service quick. Had the kimchi fries and chicken wings that were delicious. Was expecting a crispy taco skin instead of the flaccid skin used when eating peking duck. Large selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.

10pm. Hungry. Thirsty. Left hotel and walked to Vatos. Very easy to find and beautiful space. Nobody there to greet at the hostess stand so I worked my way to the back and found a small empty table in an otherwise crowded space. I picked up one of the menus on the table and started salivating. After being in Asia for a month, the thought of having anything that resembled Mexican food, let alone Mexican fusion, was a mouth-watering proposition. Alas, it was not to be.Although the doors close at 11pm, the kitchen closes early. It was 10:15pm and I was told that not only had the kitchen closed, but it had already been cleaned. No more food for the night. Apparently the kitchen shuts down at 10pm. Not even chips were available. That sentence deserves to be ended with an exclamation point but I'm too weak from hunger now to make the edit. How can they not have any chips?The staff was great. I say that sincerely. At least 2 people other than the waiter came by to explain that the kitchen was closed and there were no food options available ... oh, and by the way, it is now last call for drinks. Really? 40 minutes before you close it is last call? And how about someone popping over when I sit down to let me know, instead of me waiting 10min for a waiter?I regret not being able to sample any of their food - I was very much looking forward to it
5
Great menu with lots of choice. We had guacamole, a burrito bowl and a burger. The drinks looked amazing!
5
Loved the tacos. Had the short rib and fish ones, so so good. Fries were good too. And washed it all down with the passionfruit frozen margharita which was awesome.
4
The food here is consistently good but the restaurant is not kid friendly with their stool seating and many items on the menu are spicy.
5
good food, nice ambience. love the kimchi fries, baja fish tacos and mango prawn quesadilla! alcohol was a tad overpriced though
3
This was an interesting find in an eclectic space in bugis. The architecture is interesting but the food and drinks are very average. Seems like a a modernizes version of Mexican take out.
4
The South Beach area has a certain modern yet nostalgic vibe to it. And the same could be felt in Vatos. The decor is very industrial, but the main structure of the pre-war building is still there. Resulting in a cool and chill ambiance. Our party of 3 tried all their signatures - Kimchi Carnitas Fries : interesting combo that grows on you, tender tasty pulled pork though the kimchi was abit overpowering, but still my favorite dish of the night. In a close second were the Honey Tequila Chicken Wings : the sweet sticky coating on crispy chicken was addictive, and so was the accompanying blue cheese sauce. Finger licking good! You can pass on the Mango Prawn Quesadillas : just your average quesadilla. It seems abit "lost" and I didn't quite get anything Korean about it.I had the Makgeolita (a makgeolli + margarita combo) : I like them both separately, and they work well together but I barely tasted the makgeolli. I would give it a second chance as it is still a "handmade" drink and nobody is perfect.Service was attentive and fast, food was above average, great location, lovely ambiance - highly recommended. Abit on the pricey side but I would return again

i bought my little baby to dine at Vatos Urban, surprising it is fine and the seat in between not too pack at the outlet SOuth bridge. the food was pretty yummy .. just a bit smaller if you have 05 pax (03 L + 02 M) you need to order at 04 tacos, one salad and one fries at least if not, it will not be enough.a nice dinner place with friends
4
Food was great - we had baja fish tacos, the grilled chicken ones and carnitas kimchi fries. Strong flavours and generous portions await you. The very understanding lady at the counter also helped us avoid a potential awkward situation with customer at another table; I wouldn't say more but let's just say her help was very much appreciated and allowed us to enjoy the evening like we were meant to. Thank you
3
Though I fully support the amalgamation of various cuisines, Kimchi French Fries are a regrettable merger. That said, Vatos does make some decent street tacos - we enjoyed the shrimp and the pork. The fish tacos were not terribly crisp, and the beef tasted a little "off". Though normal sized chips are served with the Cowboy Queso, full size (5" diameter) corn tortillas are served with chips & salsa. The larger chips were stale and messy; would prefer the smaller, single size. Service is perfunctory. Much of the seating at Vatos is backless stools which means you don't need to worry about getting too comfortable. If you want to forget the whole experience, I suggest ordering the Texas Tea. This Big Boy riff on a Long Island Iced Tea contains six kinds of liquor and is served in a colossal two liter mason jar

New to this place, decided to go to this place for dinner and drinks with friends. Booked a reservation at 7pm on a Saturaday nite. Was told on the phone that we only can have the table till 9pm. if I book the reservation at 8pm then we can have the table till closing... ? serious does this make any sense? If I book at 7pm I must finish leave the place by 9pm, for other bookings or walk-ins. I asked the person, Im new to this place and its my first time and this is not very welcoming as a paying customer. I had wanting to coming here for food and drinks, if im still having more drinks are we going to be chased out or change of table seating? The person replied ok I will inform to ensure that your table will not be touch. thank you and glad, if not we will change another place for food and drinks.We went to visit this place as booked at 7pm, we went early at 6:45pm there was a happy hour promotion going on till 7pm. we had our first happy hour promotion tot was not bad and its 7pm sharp decided to have another happy hour promotion. The waitress told me its already 7pm not sure if there are any more happy hour. I told her no one came to ask for last order for happy hour before 7pm. She went to check and she came back saying yes 1 more for u only. we had food and drinks till 11pm, appreciated that we were not chased out and we had also realised that there were a few of empty tables at around 8:30pm onwards. Food is tasty and drinks are great, Price is at the mid range, Beer is SGD $15 and Margarita with beer is SGD$30. Kimchi fries is SGD$19
5
The beer plus margerita combination is just perfect! Coupled with delicious quesadillas and Kimchi fries!
5
Korean Mexican fusion, this is a must try. Go on Tuesday night when they have a promotion on the tacos.
4
good selection of food for sharing with friends and i love the grow a pear drink
must try the kimchi carnita fries and honey tequila wings!
5
I love both korean and mexican food and this restaurant really did a great job fusing the two. Very superb.
5
Great place to hang out with friends, tacos are good for sharing and very flavourful. Fusion - mix of korean and mexican flavours. Cocktail portions are huge and value for money.
4
Vatos Urban Tacos was good and I enjoyed the food! Although it was a bit pricey and the tacos were disappointing given their name.
4
Great vibes! Recommended to make reservations especially after-office-hours. The spicy chicken tacos are my favorite! The mama nachos (can be shared among 3 - 4 pax) is worth the money - absolutely delicious and fulfilling. However I was not impressed by their beers and cocktails. Not exactly pocket-friendly but a great place to hang out and enjoy some tacos every now and then
4
Visited the stall on 8Apr for dinner with friends. Waiter serves was prompt and they explained and recommend upon request. The kimchi fries was fantastic and it goes well with my passion fruits tequila. The tequila chicken was nice but abit too sweet. A plate of Nachos for $16 was abit expensive. Overall i like the food and places.
5
Wow, really angry this place is going on one year and this is my first visit. I will definitely be back, it's the best taco I've had in Singapore or Asia. Sid has done a great job - the design and layout, the food, drinks, menu all great. Good stuf
3
The concept of Mexican-Korean fusion food doesn't sit easily and I'm not sure I'm convinced. It felt to me standard Texmex in style with added touches of Korea.Having failed to obtain a booking on the previous three times I've tried I was expecting it to be heaving, so a bit surprised to find some tables unoccupied. But plenty of folk around to provide an atmosphere.We had two types of tacos (pulled pork and chicken) and both hit the spot, as did the tortilla chips. The kimchi fries however were too heavy and felt weighed down by the gunk poured over.My wife ordered a margarita which was horribly sweet. Margarita shouldn't be at all; how hard is it to make a decent one? The staff readily replaced it with a glass of wine. They have a couple of craft beers on top of more standard ones, so I was happy
4
always love to chill here, nice ambience, good vibes, lovely food. good place for gatherings as always
4
I love the drinks and is value for money as it is huge portion..the tacos was fantastic but the burritos wasnt good
4
Enjoyed everything i ordered including the fries, wings and the tacos! The beverages were also very good. Service could be a little more attentive but overall, it is a place that i will come back again.
4
A short walk from the Swissotel Stamford. Great flavors and good drinks. Fun atmosphere. Gets a thumbs up!
5
Each time we head to Vatos:
Must haves - honey tequila wings and galbi tacos.
There's a molten cheese dip that's amazing too but the aboves are killer.
3
Visiting Singapore can be a culinary delight and a hit to the pocketbook quicker than a failed attempt at a casino. However, sometimes a simple dinner with familiar flavours and light on the cost is a good change. Vatos is a simple place with a good list of tacos (flour or corn tortillas) with an above average beer list on draught. The tacos are sold as either 2 or 3 with no ability to mix and match with a cost of 11-18 SGD. the beers are full pints for 14-16 SGD. if a margarita is more in line with your needs, they cost a small fortune at 29 SGD + 9 SGD for an extra shot. Service was quick and friendly and the place was quite busy in two separate visits. Would highly recommend this place for a taco and a beer for a break in the usual dining fare.

~the first time Celine introduced me to Vatos was 7mths back, this time with my wife wasn't as good a venue for an early dinner... you gotta have some perspective that this place is great for after hours gathers with colleagues and prolly younger folks~on the recent trip I walked in about 5pm and without a reservation I was told at the door that I can have a table till 7.30pm which is nice~getting up and out the carpark escalators just make an easy left and straight till you can see the roadside and it's on your right~rather impressionably furnished the atmosphere is one for pubbing & clubbing~you'd notice why there is only one fork on the pacesetting is to allow you to eat with one hand... i mean use your hand legit~1st Time Celine ordered her selection of favoritesFresh Chips & Salsa: servings of savory tortillas with red/green salsa mix - quick and tick I can do without, maybe good with beerHoney Tequila Chicken Wings: Yes Yes Yes not crispy good texture YUMzUrban Tacos all recommended by Vatos~Chimichurri Chicken Tacos: juicy~Baja Fish Tacos: great YUMz~Korean Pork Belly Tacos: a bit left on the wanting sideNutella Nachos: plain good ole Nutella goodness with a scoop of vanilla ice cream YUMz~2nd Time we ordered what was published on the Southbeach information screenFresh Chips & Salsa totally didn't touch thisKimchi Carnitas Fries: well I won't order this again, it's not friesy or kimchii but it was ok on tasteHoney Tequila Chicken Wings: Yes Yes Yes not crispy good texture YUMz AGAINSpicy Chicken Quesadilla: oh wow a let down so fast a slide that the spice didn't hit me on the way eitherGalbi Short Rib Tacos: you can't tell by looking at the photo I'd uploaded but this one was a bit tasty but I didn't finish half of itPeach Tea: well just peachy nice :)here's the bottomline, bring everyone else except family and your older spouse (not a good date night), this place rocks for youths and really everyone else
3
Came here for a team lunch today and ordered a selection of tacos and various dishes. Food was ok but certainly not fantastic. We all had the house beer which was a little bitter for my liking. Service was efficient. Main annoyance was that the music was too loud: hard to hear the conversation. Not sure I want to return to this one
3
They're known for drinks and tacos, both are great, cool decor tooSolid beer selection, including some imported USA beers on tap. A nice mix of cocktails to choose from, several creative margarita offerings The service staff is where it goes wrong. The dining area is crowded with staff, but they're all prepping for dinner service or chatting with each other. We arrived around 5:45 on Saturday. With so many staff around, it was difficult to get anyone's attention, yet they're everywhere.After a nice meal and several rounds of drinks, in fact still ordering the next round, hostess told us we must leave NOW, as this table is reserved. I understand F&B and reservations, but we're spending money and there are at least 6 empty table and zero queue. No alternatives offered, simply leave. We cancelled the drink order, paid the bill and left. Attempted to discuss with manager on walk out, she couldn't have been less concerned.Good concept but staff has ruined it, we won't be back
5
I love Vatos! It doesn't matter if I take my friends, family or boyfriend here, we always have a good time.Ambiance is cosy, trendy and unpretentious, but chairs are wooden stools with no backs and can be uncomfortable. Tables are quite close to one another too.Food is yummy, but can be oily sometimes. I usually get the fish tacos and tequila chicken wings, but most of the tacos are good! I like the peach frozen margarita too, but the beer cocktails are so much fun as well
4
This place has great tacos - almost every protein is worth trying but my recommendation is the short ribs. Have the Kimchi fries as well - sinful jut absolutely delicious!
4
Chicken Tacos was good and their cheese dishes were amazing! Love their ambience and especially the location as it's really convenient to my office.
5
Love the food, friendly and prompt service. Went there twice, will definitely go back for more tacos!
4
Dishes served were nice and hot. While its on the oily side, it taste well with the generous serving of garnish and meat.
Food and drinks are on the pricier side. Good for a group setting
4
This place is great for drinks and food! Delicious tacos, with special cocktails. Prices are not too expensive considering the quality and location.
5
Great atmosphere, great food, great service! Loved the one in Seoul, loved this one in Singapore. Will visit again!
5
It was our first visit here but definitely not the last. Though the servers were not too observant( our dessert was served without forks) nor attentive, the delicious food and awesome drinks made up for it.
4
A nice place, not easily accessible though. Loved the environment and the liveliness of this place. Being a vegetarian, the options were very limited but we enjoyed eating our nachos, music and the crowd. I would request the management to add on more vegetarian options as mexican usually has a lot of vege options
4
highly recommended.!!!!!!!!!!!Best salsa in Singapore, authentic and actually taste like salsa! with roasted tomatoes. Location is awkward, not easy to find, and the place is dark and not very cheerful hence the four starsBut it is a pretty good place for Tex Mex in Singapore..√¢‚Ç¨¬¶ with Korean ingredients that mostly complements the flavor, except in some dishes when you get the sweet Korean surprise instead of the spicy Mexican flavorGreat tacos, great beer selection And will cost about the same as the other Mexican places in Clark Quay or Robertson Qua
4
Went there on Monday for dinner. There was $12 classic magaritas and 30% off other magaritas. Margaritas were huge but the strawberry margarita was a bit too sweet. Food was pretty good and we had the fries, short rib tacos and wings. It was pretty reasonably priced and decent portion sizes. The ambience is nice but may be noisy to catch up with friends. Also the manager was not the friendliest although the rest of the staff were ok.
5
Awesome food and awesome service. Just hope they remain consistent with their service and all is good
5
Awesome ambience! We tried the guacamole which was delicious. Had pork belly and fish tacos. Fish was crisp and good but pork belly was a bit too fatty for me.
5
Good food, great atmosphere and there's a bar inside. Ideal for dinner before a fun night out. Cocktails are good but pricy.
4
I enjoyed the Korean and Mexican fusion. We got the fish tacos, chimichurri chicken tacos and the Kimchi carnitas fries. The chicken tacos were good and the kimchi carnitas fries was really interesting.
3
It was our first visit to a Mexican restaurant. Food was of good quality. We were looking forward to crispy tacos but they only had taquitos. The beef tacos was good too.
5
Not many people were there. Good place for Mexican- Korean fusion good. Enjoyed the kimchi carnitas fries and tacos especially.
5
the tacos are so good, especially the carnitas and the baja fish.
Carnitas is usually my favorite but this baja fish tacos are the best tacos i have ever eaten
5
Love the tacos, especially the beef, pork belly and fish tacos. Great value for money, with generous servings of meat and toppings for the price. Nice selection of sides and snacks as well - the tequila glazed chicken wings are top notch. Overall great vibe, good place to hang out with friends at night
4
Love the fact that it is easily accessible (just next to South Beach Hotel). The food was really good if you like Korean and Mexican food - two cuisines i can never eat sick of. The kimchi fries are a must try with the tequila wings! I would recommend sharing a beergarita (?) because it's too much for one. Will come again
4
I know that drinks in Singapore can very expensive, however the Margaritas in the place are ridiculously expensive and not that great. Took the regular Margarita on the rocks and it was too watery, my friends had the same watery drink so it was not a mistake or the bartender was on break at that moment. I will go for beer next time. Having said that the tacos were delicious! Service very good and ambiance quite nice
4
Nice place with nice food and good for informal group gatherings as food can be shared and many choices of alcohol
5
Was introduced to Vatos by a colleague and really enjoyed the ambiance and the food.
Good location and service. Would recommend a visit or two - I'll definitely be going back to try a few more of their offerings.
4
The service was efficient and so was the food delicious food. However, it would have been better if the staff were more polite.
4
Generous portions of tasty tacos. Good selection of beers. Good atmosphere. Went in with no reservation and got a table immediately. However, would recommend to book as it's pretty busy.
3
Restaurant did not receive our reservation for 10pax via Chope. Hence, it was chaotic when we arrived with no tables for us. Luckily our group was only 7pax on actual day, we ended up having to squeeze in table for 6.
5
I was so excited to see that the Vatos Urban Tacos menu had tamales on the menu. Tamales are one of my favorite Mexican foods and are very hard to find in Asia. The tamales (and tacos) for that matter, are delicious. We also ordered the margarita with the strawberry and pear cider in it, would highly recommend.Definitely make a reservation here, we went late on a Thursday evening and it was still packed. If you are taking a taxi to/from, it is convenient to be picked up/dropped off outside of the JW Marriott.
5
I had heard a lot about this place and am so glad I went. Usually this place is packed and you need to book in advance but I lucked out with a rainy night and was able to just walk in. The vibe is very chilled out and everyone sits on stools & on long tables and you can see the open kitchen. The drinks menu was quite extensive but I had my eye on the prize the boozy jumbo margaritas. We were a table of 5 so we each had a different one and all were happy. I highly recommend the corona one! The food was a fusion of Mexican and Korean which was awesome! I recommend the chicken taquinons, nachos, & kimchi fries. If you still have space (unlikely) get the pork belly tacos. Definitely would go back again!
5
Korean-Mexican fusion food at its best! I've never thought of combining kimchi with guacamole, salsa and fries but I was wrong. The "ritas" are huge and can be easily shared between 2-3 people (or just for yourself if you love alcohol!) There are many more fusion dishes such as galbi on a bed of nachos with a dressing of salsa, guacamole and jalape√É¬±o peppers! I would advise drivers to park at Shaw Towers and walk to the restaurant
1
Visited at 7pm on Monday, Dec. 19 and experienced the rudest hostess ever with her first offering us a table but then telling us she didn't trust us to leave within an hour and we would have to sit outside. When inquiring about anything else inside we were told we could sit in the bar which was empty. After sitting down we were then told that table was taken. Amazing lesson on how not to treat customers.
4
This is the 2nd time that I have visited Vatos. For this time, my friend ordered the tequila chicken wings (chicken wings are well marinate, it blend well with the cheese dip). Re-ordered the Kimchi fries, it was good (still taste good after it cool). Since it was a Friday evening when we went, there is a 2hr dining time rule. Staffs are quick to explain that the reason being that their place is small and they want to cater to as much customers as possible. Overall, the service & the food is good. I don't mind visiting them again
4
nice vibes, food was not bad, just a little pricey. overall will return again for a nice place to hang out and chill
5
The tacos were tasty, drinks were potent and service was prompt. When we had run out of tacos for the dip, complimentary ones appeared without having to be asked for!
Definitely will be coming back here to try other items!
4
Good food and just the right amount of attention from the wait staff. It was just a little cramped but it goes to show how popular this place is. Yummy makgeolitas too
3
Had higher expectations due to the reviews I've read on social media and food publications. Could have been better priced for the quality of food served.
5
The best fusion food of Mexican dishes with the Korean twist . Best food and bestest service. Keep up the good work
4
Food and drinks were fantastic, especially the pork belly tacos and the margarita beer! Service was great too!
4
The tacos and honey chicken wings were delicious. Although the Kimchi fries were slightly disappointing, but the excellent service made up for it.
4
Came along with Chope voucher deal for their diners choice menu. Atmosphere was nice for a group looking to hang out over drinks and sharing food - music a bit loud so just need to speak a bit louder! After ordering the staff were quick to bring free starter of corn chips and two salsa. Tacos - best: fish and short rib, chicken and pulled pork tasty but not amazing, pork belly a bit dry. The soft shells were a bit too soft and quickly became soggy! Overall def recommend for a nice group spot and the short rib and fish even without the taco shell!
3
I'd purchased the dinner tasting menu voucher (of five of their best selling tacos) via Chope, but encountered difficulty in using it. The ground crew didn't even know there was such a voucher and spent some time verifying it. When the bill came, I was charged for the voucher, even though I'd already paid Chope. After another round of explanation to the wait staff, the amended bill came back, but I was charged GST for the voucher, which shouldn't be the case. The management should look into communicating all promotions to the ground crew. The ordering and billing process was frustrating and tedious. Food wise ... I enjoyed the kimchi carnitas fries and margarita/beer mix very much. It's worth visiting on Mondays, when they have $12 margaritas and 30% off margarita based drinks
3
Visited this restaurant twice. Once with family and another time friends and family. During the first visit I was told that only bar seats were available. I had to convince the guy at the door to get us a table as we had a toddler with us and we drove all the way from the west. It took them some time to serve us the complimentary chips and the drinks even though they were readily available. Ordered tacos, burittos, buritto bowl and chips with three dips. The tacos were good but the buritto was below par! Who serves buritto with kimichi? The burrito bowl was average too. They have an extensive alcoholic drink selections but the non-alcoholic drink selection was pretty limited and the music was too loud. Overall, it is just an average Mexican place strictly for stressed up young executives, not for foodies
5
Drinks were slightly pricey, but suitable for sharing between 2 people! Food was yummy, would go back again in future!
5
Absolutely loved our meal at Vatos! Highly recommend the Galbi nachos, Galbi tacos, pork belly tacos and their margaritas. The honey tequila wings were great too. Service was good and we didn't have to wait long to be attended to. Will definitely be back!
5
Vatos brings together the best of Korean and Mexican to produce tantalizing dishes (that are still delicious despite being refrigerated and re-heated the next day). Portions are also filling.
5
this place is really good. been here for several times. love the food. the best burrito bowl i can find in singapore.
2
The food was ok. I ordered tacos. They are quite small. Not value for money. Evidently the way to go is to get a burrito. They are huge and filling. They have lots of interesting cocktails. Service is pretty terrible and food and drinks are slow. We ended getting up and getting things on our own. Water, silverware, putting orders in at the bar. The toilet is outside the restaurant in front of a different bar and there is only one for women and one for men. Inconvenient and you wait ages. I don't think I would go back again.
5
I was very excited to hear about this Korean-Mexican restaurant-bar from my friend as Korean and Mexican food are 2 of my favourite cuisines! Upon visiting, the food really did not disappoint. My group of 4 ordered some of their signature items, like the Kimchi Carnitas Fries, their signature Tacos - Baja Fish and Barbacoa Pork, Honey Tequila Wings. The tacos were really good, both the fish and the pork. The pork is slightly spicy but it gives a good kick in the flavour. The fish was also fried to perfection in its beer batter. What stood out for the wings dish for me was actually the deep-fried jalapenos. I was initially skeptical of eating jalapenos like that but I sure was proved wrong! It lends a balance to the sweet honey wings when you eat them together.We also shared one of their Vatos' Ritas - margarita + beer or cider. I loved the ingenuity of how this was served as the beer/cider is placed upside-down into a the margarita and as you sip, the beer/cider will gradually flow into the margarita drink. Only perhaps this was the most expensive item on our order. But for the size and given that it's alcohol, I will overlook the cost... Overall, it was a good experience with quick serving of the food. I would love to come back again to try other items on their menu, perhaps more of the korean flavoured tacos next time
5
Came here a couple of times and great experience each time. Very innovative and a tasty twist to comfort food we all know. When you walk in the restaurant has brick walls and kind of dark, with a pretty good bar and I especially like that the tables are slightly higher than normal tables, for extra comfort. The kimchi carnitas fries are off the charts delicious! I got the short rib galbi tacos which were tasty but i were very Chewy and I ended up spitting out half of the meat eating only the very tasty condiments. The mango margaritas are really king sized and maybe the best in Singapore. Fish tacos are a must try along with the kimchi carnitas fries and the fish burger Great place
5
The food is fantastic: kimchi fries, wings, fish tacos, beef and pork. All have an amazing twist to it that make it especially delicious. We also love the drink offers: our IPA on tap- Modern Times Blazing World. Also had their margaritas...yum! I would say their drinks are on the expensive end.
5
There's a reason that this place has a ton of amazing review in Yelp- even though Yelp is still slowly growing/being adopted in Singapore. It's walking distance from the Fairmont and the Raffles Hotel. A tad hidden and quite small in size. Tables are farm style and quite narrow in profile. Their chips & Guacamole, kimchi carnitas fries as well as tacos were the bomb! They have the tastiest hot sauce that is simply addicting. There's only 1 word to describe their frozen margaritas.... HUMUNGUS and delicious especially with the hot & humid weather. This is a go to during my business trips to Singapore
5
I live in San Diego and have great Baja mex all day. I got stuck in a down pour and stopped in with very low expectations. Having traveled around experiencing disappointing Mexican all over the US, this was great given its thousands of miles from its origin. Spicy salsa, fresh tortillas and the Barbacoa was spot on. It's hard to find good chips away from Mexico so the free chips was good enough. If your craving spicy mex for a change from southeast Asian food,it's a winner.
3
The food is great. Tasty, fusion type of variety. However the air inside is terrible. Be prepared to smell after dining there.
4
Nice dinning experience, enjoyed the food. Drinks serving was huge, well enough to share for two persons.
5
Decided to stop in here for dinner. We were. It disappointed food was great service was quick. So good!
4
food was good.
drinks came later than the food. but it is fine.
mixture of pub and restaurant feel.
highly suggest to reserve as always pack.
overall it was a good.
3
Quesadillas too salty; fries not freshly fried. Service was okay. Atmosphere is good. And the building is very pretty.
5
My new favourite food haunt. Great food, awesome beers. Only down side is that the music is a tad loud.
3
Craving tacos on our trip, googled this and read some good reviews. Ordered pretty much every flavour taco between the 2 of us. All with the same 3 toppings which is dissapointing. Lack of a decent amount of sauce and the meat was dry. Needed some salt or seasoning. We ordered the corn chips with 3 dips, pretty much a waste of time as you receive basically the same thing when you sit down. For free.We waited 20 minutes to actually be asked if we wanted a drink or anything to start. It wasnt busy, so this was dissapointing. The drinks were ok and we upgraded to double alcohol. Which cost half an arm but atleast we could taste it.Not terrible but not amazing.
3
This is my second time at this place. The galbi shortrib tacos were fantastic, with flavourful pork and a generous serving of onions. We had the carne asada quesadilla as well; the tortilla was great with loads of cheese but the beef was on the dry side. Most disappointing of all was the kimchi carnitas fries. I was really looking forward to it but they left out the melted cheese. One of the waitresses simply dismissed us and told us that there's a handful of cheese inside when there was obviously no signs of cheese in the dish at all. Only after a few tries did another staff member kindly gave us some melted cheese separately but the cheese had already hardened by the time it got to our table. I was really disappointed but definitely try the fries if you go there because it is simply delicious! Maybe we were just out of luck but I'll be back again!
3
Free chips with salsa used to be better; I know they're free, but they shouldn't be served cold & soggy. Tacos were good, but they used to be great. I do remember the short rib ones having more meat, & this time I ate, it was on the tougher side. Chimichurri Chicken tacos were delicious
4
I love this place food is great, the environment is great, little pricey but very good. I have eaten there atleast once a months since i moved to Singapore and the service is always less than desirable. I tolerate the bad service because the food is that goo

Vatos in itaewon, Seoul was our family's favourite but Vatos Singapore fell short. Physical appearance was the same but the ambience was not as vibrant. Food was not as delicious either. Fish tacos were a bit greasy and the pork was a bit dry.

Awesome place, their drinks with cider are fantastic and the kimchi pork tacos is a MUST TRY! The tequila chicken wings with the dip was dope, tender and juicy. Great place for friends gathering and great music!

Food is awesome, authentic mexican food. Servings are huge, fresh ingredients. Quite crowded, worth a visit

Food was good. Friendly staff and nice relaxed atmosphere. We had an enjoyable evening! Thank you üòÉ

Great food and drinks. For meat tacos, the meat was slightly overcooked and was tough, but the seafood tacos were great! Kimchi fries were fantastic! Am not a fan of stools as chairs for a dinner place if you're sitting too long, it gets abit uncomfortable. But overall a great dinner place

enjoyed the evening, good for a casual drink or a meal w friends. complementary tortillas (homemade!) w salsas at the beginning was great! Carne Asada tacos became cold fast because the AC was blasting! Quesadilla are quite rich, i prefer the original dish. generally a good experience

I came for a quick weekday lunch with two colleagues. We ordered two soft tacos each - my colleagues had the fish, and I had the barbacoa pork. The average price per 2 tacos was 11-13 SGD, and the fillings were generous and very flavorful. I liked that each table came with a complimentary serving of nachos and salsa, although the nachos came in the form of 3 large crispy circles. Vatos Urban Tacos is a Korean outfit - and Singapore loves everything Korean so it's one of the many Korean imports that finally set up shop here. You'll get Mexican tacos with a Korean twist, so don't come here looking for authentic Mexican fare. Flavor-wise and penny-wise, it's worth a visit, or even two. I hope they stay consistent in both food and service

This is a fun restaurant with great food. The guacamole has a nice consistency and is made with fresh and flavorful ingredients. The pico de gallo is excellent and refreshing. We have been several times and the fish tacos have been consistently. The bowls are a great option too; the portions are quite large and suitable for sharing
4
Quick service, great tasting foods. They serve huge nachos along with 2 dips to begin with. We ordered the special fries that comes with pulled pork, onions, etc, good for sharing among 3 people. Had mixture of tacos, short beef ribs (a bit chewy), fish Baja is excellent, chicken. Will return again to try their burgers which looks yummy but didn't have the stomach space ;
5
Hungry for nachos we decided to stop in. Starting with my drink to the chips and salsas to the nachos to the quesadilla, everything was excellent. Service was good. I would definitely come again.

Ordered delivery and the only food that tasted comforting was the burger. Would be better to dine at the restaurant instead of ordering delivery.

Our 2nd visit. The first was ok, novel food, quality and service not noteworthy, also ok. This visit was terrible. Order was misplaced twice, out of 3 types of tacos that we ordered only one was ok. The pulled pork was so dry that we left most of it on our plates. The fish taco was meh and the Kalbi just edible. With the exception of one switched on young woman, the staff were apathetic and spaced out. Can't see a reason to return and would actively discourage my friends from wasting their money

Came here for lunch with a co-worker. We both had pork tacos and they were very good. The homemade sauce on the tacos was flavorful and spicy!The service wasn't very good. It took quite a long time to get our food and they weren't even packed.The drink menus seemed a bit pricey

Its affordable and good with a ambience. From my experience of singapore's extremely limited mexican dining scene, vatos does a good job of standing out from the usual fray with its korean fusion texmex style of food. It was very affordable and the quality was very decent so I left more than happy. If you're looking for a certified dining experience then perhaps this isnt the place, but if youre looking for a nice tasty meal then vatos is right up your alley

Visited Vatos on July 15, with a friend, for a quick drink and a Queso / Quesadilla. The music was canned 90s junk, loud and poor quality (here's an idea: use Spotify and play 2016 lounge or funk) staff are disorganized and would make the Mcdonalds crew look like beauty pageant material (idea 2: try having staff who look presentable and are not morbidly obese, this was a real horror show), and lastly, try having food that is not deepfried and so badly prepared and to need to be sent back. Neither of us ate our food - it was Dis-gust-ing. (idea 3: have some basic Mexican food cooking lessons and don't make food that the staff clearly like eating). Never again

The food was very nice, spicy, well mixed and tasty. The tacos was soft shell and soooo good! If you go there and don't pretend:- Service ( they are not trained. Kind and nice but can feel they do not have experience ...anyway they put all the best to help and this is good. Manager pls train them better:)- low priceFor plate the price is to much. A starter with guacamole, tacos and burrito, no drinks 50 $. I am not talking about the quality and flavour of the food that is so nice. I am talking about how you present a plate and the quantity of it. Maybe next to a tacos u can put some extra salad with some topping, chips and cheese ecc. So many ideas to make it better and worth the price to come back.- the environment was okay. U cannot feel the Korean and Mexican fusion. Why do not decorate maybe with "La muerte?"Guillermo del Toro made a beautiful version of it. Sombreros?I think that this place can be SO MUCH better if you invest on in starting from the service ( direct customer sales) to the price of a dish. Make it worth your money. Anyway should try I hope this few words will help because I really like the cooking

For several weekends we have been enjoying lunch at Vatos Urban Tacos, a new Korean-Mexican casual restaurant located in the new South Beach complex, in a restored colonial building. The restaurant is owned by two Korean Americans who have created a wonderful blend of spicy flavours in their unique menu. What we like is the very consistent and tasty guacamole, the spicy and garlicky salsas with handmade tortillas (you can watch them being made in the open kitchen) and of course the tacos. The best in our opinion are the fish tacos, made with tempura-style fish fillets, just outstanding. The barbacoa pork was another winner, and the prawn and mango was tasty. The Georgia peach tea is about 750 ml to wash it all down. What we have had that was not as good was the Mexican Cesar salad, it missed the mark. The Kalbi (or Galbi) beef tacos were OK but I've had better kalbi. The pork belly tacos were a disappointment and I would give these a miss, a lot of gristle and poorly cooked pork belly that should not have found their way into a taco. The service is quite acceptable and friendly. The restaurant is in the new South Beach complex. We found the complex poorly managed: escalators and lifts that do not work; the common bathrooms are dirty and do not have paper towels or toilet tissue (ever, after four visits). It is shocking such a new high end complex is not being properly maintained

Not a bad meal, but not incredible either. Interesting fusion ideas though. Separately, I love Korean and Mexican food for their strong flavors. Our meal at Vatos fell short in terms of flavors. We had the korean pork belly tacos and chicken chimichurri tacos. The pork belly need stronger marinades. The chicken chimichurri is more flavorful, but not enough. The kimchi carnitas fries was not bad. A little bit too much onion toppings. But one can tell the carnitas was quite well done. I asked about the tortillas and was told that it was 60 percent corn and 60 percent wheat flour. I have to say it makes an interesting tortilla. It has the smooth look typical of the flour tortilla, but it has the tougher/harder texture typical of the corn tortilla. Salsa and chips are not bad. Guacamole needs more kick, but the avocado ripeness was perfect. The Vatos-rita is a must try. We shared the mango margarita with corona beer one. I almost tried the tamales, but seeing it served with chimichurri (not Mexican) salsa, probably I would be disappointed (I am dying for delicious traditional Tamales).Nice overall ambience

Komex as influenced by Mexican street tacos in Los Angeles and home-cooked Korean meals. This place served very interesting tacos. I would recommend kimchi fries, wings, porkbelly tacos and the drinks =) Their drink selection is huge and the portion is generous. However the drink is considered expensive SGD29 for a special frozen magaritas with beers. Without the drink, the food is very reasonable priced and the ambience is grea

This place is located just behind the Suntec mall and boasts of a very lively and teenage environment. The overall service and the food is superb. The drinks were just sublime.

So I really wanted this place to be something awesome. But... Ok so here it is. Beer cold. Salsas nice and fresh. Service is ok. Hip ambience. Location walkable from Bugis. Vegan options if you ask. Taco wrap? The suck. I mean, really thin fall apart messy up your sleeve crappy nothingness. Impossible to eat unless you go with a spoon! How about switching to crispy taco shells? Cmon

I enjoy the relaxing pub feeling and the dark light, six of us ordered about 10 sides to share. The special mentioning will be the kimchi fries and Ïπ©Í≥º ÏÇ¥ÏÇ¨. Good gathering and chatting! SGD 120 in total. We did not order alcohol.

Was really excited to have dinner here and check out this new concept, but was incredibly disappointed with the poor poor service. We informed the waiter that we couldn't have dairy, but the tacos came with cheese; we kindly asked if they could be replaced, but they waiter said the chef refused because we didn't inform the waiter, which we actually did. 10 minutes later, we found broken wood toothpick chips in our tacos! We informed the waitress, who didn't apologize or come back with any feedback. Hoping for an explanation, which we didn't get, we asked for the manager, hoping to share constructive feedback. Falling short, he just said, "the dish was probably really close to the burgers so the toothpick probably just fell in..." as he laughed and waved a found a toothpick, still failing to apologize for the consecutively bad experiences. He looked looked at us as if we did something wrong and condescending said, "so what do you want me to do about it?" In a nutshell, won't be returning but hope the service team learns and improves from these experiences

I went to this resto for a girls' night recently. The theme is Korean-Mexican. I would say the menu is mostly Mexican items and they try to add the Korean part with some types of meat and kim chi. They have a lot of interesting cocktails (around 7-8 flavors for Margaritas) and different versions of the Corona-rita. They also have some craft beer on draught as well. I had the Galbi Short Rib Tacos and was a bit disappointed. The meat itself was delicious, but there was hardly any sauce on my tacos. It was like two small tortillas, throw on some meat and shredded cabbage and chopped red onions. More like a salad and I was still hungry afterwards. A couple people had Burritos and this seems the way to go. Good portion size and flavorful (although they all said it was quite spicy). The wait staff are pretty terrible, we had to wave people down and when we would order, half of them seemed confused. One of the waitresses seemed annoyed, and was a bit rude, when we asked for water. We had previously ordered it from our waiter, but after 15 mins still nothing. So we asked a waitress if it was self-service (because we could see the pitchers and glasses out on a table) and she made a disgusted face at us and said "you have to order water, did you order water?" Even though the service wasn't great (but hey I kind of expect this as it is Singapore Customer Service), I would probably go back and try it again

Staffs are SO poorly trained. The main staff at the counter was receiving a phone order when we arrived, but we were not greeted properly, instead we were left to stand there and wait while other staff members were no where to be seen. What could have been done was maybe to gesture for us to wait, with a smile in between sentences - if other places (or even small cafes can afford to do that I don't see why you guys can't.) Fine, perhaps multi tasking was not her strong point. Seated down, food ordered and finally served. It was alright, not as delicious as we expected it to be (maybe because we came with high expectations/ mood was dampened by service crew).*** I had a burrito and while eating it, I FOUND a strand of HAIR, all rolled nicely with the ingredients in the burrito. Informed the staff member and she poorly offered to make a new one but I rejected as there was the other side of the burrito(it was cut into two halves) and I wouldn't be able to finish the new one anyway. "Okay", a blur response while she walks away - I'm sorry, are staff not trained to apologize? Well, mood was totally spoilt by then. To top off their "wonderful" service, water was not topped up either even though our glasses were empty for quite sometime. We were given a measly 10% off the bill, when other places would have just removed the whole burrito off the order. Never coming back again. Horrible, APPALLING service with so-so tasting food

Great industrial hipster deco and buzzing vibe but more importantly - punchy and innovative cuisine. A wide range of excellent craft beers including the watermelon wheat and a strong offering in tacos from fish to prawn to beef and pork. The kimchi pork fries are possibly the best fries in Singapore, so much flavour and not a truffle in sight. What a relief.Service is rapid if a little cold, but that's only because they've got a lot of people to feed and the focus is on the food & pace. Definitely recommended

We celebrated Mother's Day trying their unique fusion of two of our favourite cuisine for lunch. Place was busy though much busier in the evening.We loved the Chili Lime Shrimp Tacos, the Vatos burrito and the Pork Kim Quessidillas! Their jumbo peach ice tea was just right - not too sweet as the typical resto teas. We will be back to try the other items in the menu.

We were not too far away, when I decided to open my TripAdvisor app and see what was around me. The word Vatos just stood out. Growing in California and also being Hispanic, how could I not identify. I'm glad we did visit this place. I enjoyed the Tamales which were excellent and the accompanying sauces were fresh. We also ordered some pork rib tacos that were filled with loads of meat. Lastly, the drinks were large, made with excellent ingredients and tasty. They even had tequila from Corralejo. We even talked to the guy who runs the place and he is also a West Coast California native. Awesome guy! Keep it up and will definitely be back for this week

It's not easy to find good tacos in Singapore. The ones at Vatos delivered on flavour and quality ingredients. What we had:1. short rib tacos - tender short rib meat served with a spicy aoili and Asian slaw2. baja fish tacos - tempura battered fish with Apple coleslaw and chipotle mayo3. Carne asada tacos - tender cubes of grilled beef topped with onions, cilantro and a lovely hot sauce with bite4. Kimchi fries - crispy shoe string fries topped with mild kim chee and tender pulled pork5. classic frozen margarita - great on a hot day. It was a pretty strong drink too. Also good was the complimentary starter comprising three large pieces of crispy corn ships served with a red tomato salsa and a green tomato salsa.Our bill totalled S$80. Only slight downside - the place is fit out like a bar so has a rather dark cave like feel. A shame when it's nice and sunny outside. But that won't stop us from coming back soon for those tacos
