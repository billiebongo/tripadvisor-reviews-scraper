I eat here whenever I need simple satisfying Jap food. The food quality is good and price affordable. Service is friendly too. My fave is the onigiri, grilled tofu, chicken karaage, kawahagi and whiskey soba. Definitely worth a visit.

Small and cosy restaurant that serves quality food. The Yaki Somen Whisky, Ramen Tonkotsu and the Bara Chiraishi Don is a tasty must try. The Yakitori sticks are a unique taste experience too. A restaurant worth going. Highly recommended.

A small and comfortable restaurant that serve quality food which is value for money. My favorite is Bara Chirashi, Chicken Wings & Chicken Hearts Yakitori. Had their Special CNY Yu Sheng, which is very good and yummy. Must try!!

The food here is decent, with fair spread for diners to choose from. We had ramen, soba, yakitori, braised pork, unagi, fried rice, etc, as well as a bottle of sake recommended by the wait staff. One thing to note though, the noodle portions are small, so do take note while ordering. As this eatery is fairly popular, you may have to wait during the peak periods. Service level can also be patchy, which was why our group of 12 was squeezed to a seating area for 10 even though reservation was made in advance. The air-condtioning is also not working well, and depending where you are seated, it can be warm and stuffy.

We sampled quite a lot of food in our first visit to this neighborhood izakaya. Standouts were the salmon mentai roll and salmon carpaccio. The sashimi was alright; the whiskey somen is not really my cup of tea, but the tonkotsu ramen was delicious albeit small serving of ramen. We also tried the grilled seasonal sakana (sea bream) which was expensive at $45 for a medium sized fish. The chicken skewers were good and portions quite generous. The bill for three persons came up to $480, including $200 for two bottles of sake which were too expensive in my view. Next time we will stick to one bottle plus beer!

It's the 6th day of lunar new year and just back to work. With the festive mood lingers, whole team decided to pop over to the 'yakitori talk of the town'. What fascinated us wasn't just only the yakitori which we all came for. The sashimi was so fresh and the whisky soba to die for. Sake and Shōchū fans, the varieties that they had, you definitely won't be disappointed. My TOP three must have yakitori was kawa, tebasaki and bacon wrapped asparagus. Not forgetting those fat juicy oysters....Oishii !

It's easy to dismiss this place but don't. The food is good. It's a small cozy joint that can probably tightly squeeze 30 max of which 8? have to be in front of the grill counter.Yesterday was my second visit and I ordered a variety of kushiyaki (grilled skewered food). It was oishii.I had the chicken meatball, chicken soft bone, chicken gizzard and asparagus wrapped in bacon accompanied by a side salad. My least favorite would be the asparagus which surprised me as I love bacon. But this stick lacked flavour compared to the chicken soft bone which was my favourite (imagine coming to a eatery to eat bones haha). Anyway the sticks are small so great for ordering a variety to try. In a previous visit I had their whiskey somen, sashimi, pitan tofu and salad. The somen was so good! I am imagining my next meal here. I pair the smokey taste of whiskey somen with some beef or pork skewers and more chicken soft bones. Yum.Oh yes. They appear to have a decent list of alcoholic beverages to wash down the kushiyaki. Didn't really scrutinize as I don't drink. Aim for the yakitori, aim for the cozy Japanese style ambience and don't miss out on checking out this new kid on the block.A good place for friends, a good place for the kids, a good place for a romantic yet casual dinner and a good place for solo dining.Bon appetite

Tried this here out of curiosity as I am a typical fan of Cold Noodles.The sesame dressing over the cold noodles was flavourful. The place has a pleasant ambience and experience. Look out for Shaun, Assistant Manager. He will be of help to you if you need any assistance in your food selection

An excellent kushiyaki restaurant if you enjoy grilled Japanese food on sticks. The menu is wide and varied and of particular mention must be the pork belly sticks, the chicken mid wing joint, the sweet potato and the beef. Price per stick ranges between $2 and $6.90. The chefs are Japanese and the restaurant is well patronized so do make a reservation. The other jap foods such as sashimi (freshness guaranteed) and noodles are also available. Worth a visit if you like Japanese sticks!
