TBH i really really like LJS more than macs. Their chicken fillets are really good. Its like a huge nugget. Every kid fantasies! The chili sauce offered is quite nice as well. Occasionally promotional coupons are offered through their facebook page. Make use of it!

I like eating at this food outlet a lot. the staff are fun loving and friendly. They speak well and serve quickly. I like their service. The food are delicious too. except maybe the chicken meat which is sometimes a bit hard. I like eating soft and well cooked meat
