Affordable and filling 4 course meal. The service star is fantastic. They have their own unique birthday song and also a birthday board. 5 stars.

Healthy food , delicious And nice display of food.... No crowds and nice environment.
Easy digestion . Suggestions o have 6set meal instead of 8set ... quite a big portion for soup.

We had an lovely dinner at Sufood last Friday. The food quality and presentation are good. It will change your expectation of a typical vegetarian restaurant.
5
I like the variety of dishes here. Its 3 course meals are very well Organised. The appetiser and drinks are very tasty and refreshing and the food is creatively designed and paired well with the drinks.
5
Need to take vegetarian food yet canâ€™t think of one, try this sufood at Raffles City.Reservation needed for this outlet. The restaurant was packed by 6.30pm. For tourists, this outlet is easily accessible by MRT, taxi n buses. The food presentation and ambience is worth a second visit
4
Tried their 4 course meal.. Very fillingBreadstick was very nice.. Smooth and warm served with tasty dips.Great salad mix with fruits.. Serving was big..Mushroom soup was slighty average.. Feels more like can type.Main course was the best.. Pasta with baked cheese and pizza
4
Had 4 course dinner with my family and on the 2nd course we were half full. *There were 6 and 8 courses option too. * some but not all dishes allow to be garlic/onion/egg/milk free1st dish - fragrant breadstick hot from oven 2nd dish - salad in a huge plate with lots of ingredients- toufu ,beetroot, avocado, nuts 3rd dish- burdock loutus soup 4th dish (main) - wild mushroom charcoal tagliatelle (noodle)
5
we had a very enjoyable lunch today. today being halloween, the staff were in the holiday attire. it was very cool. the staff who served us was polite, friendly and gave good recommendations of the dishes. the salads are really fresh and delicious, the portions were bigger than the photos. the oyster mushroom hot pot rice is very good. the bread sticks came still warm and it's nice and chewy. overall a lovely meal and service unexpectedly better than average. even though the restaurant was filling up when we were half way through the meal, we were served rather quickly. the only downside I feel, is that the prices of the beverages are a bit on the high side. restaurant decor is nice and modern and there was enough sound proofing so that the noise level was contained

I went there for the second time for my friends' birthday. I was the one who organised it after a pretty good first visit there. The second time however we (8 of us) were served by this waitress who clearly wasn't trained for customer service. But was saved by the manager who waived off the water charges after a mini misunderstanding between us and the waitress (kudos for him he deserves the manager of the year lol).The food are pretty good. The only issues I have are the portions and the price (is a little bit pricey for vegetarian). I chose 6 courses the first round and none of us could finish the food so we takeaway. The second round I chose 4 courses but variation is limited. Please improvise on the courses. Overall me and my friends had fun night thank you

I was recommended to come here to try this all vegetarian restaurant. It has a generic modern decor located on the 2nd floor of Raffles City mall tucked away in the corner. Relatively quite full on coming here few days ago which would be a good sign.We came here as a party of 6 people. We all ordered either the 4 or 6 course set meal.Here is where the improvements lie: 1) we ordered 9 glasses of water thinking water was free. Considering the restaurant was really busy and slightly understaff I purposely ordered more to help the waitress from keep coming to fill our water. It wasnt made apparent to us until 20mins (as it took that long to get water for somer eason) that the waitress told us that there is a charge for water. A small issue as we told the waitress we didnt realise this and we ordered more to help her from coming to fill water so often. She accused us for knowing that the water was not free as it was in the menu and purposely ordering 9 glasses. Ludacris accusation. THanksfully the trainee-manager apoligize on her behalf and offered us free water. (nicely done and managed by the trainee manager).2) It was only after we placed our orders and after our soup/appetizer came thatsome of the menu items were sold out. They could have told us before... 3) They forgot who ordered the 6 set meal vs 4 set meal. As a result appetizer would come after main course? THis is just poor service and organization 4) No explaination of the dishes being served5) the food it self was soso as the food was very heavy and rich not the typical vegetarian type of food expected 6) no parking voucher overall this place has potential but currently has a lot of shortcomings. Training of staff on customer service would be a start
3
Nice food & nice ambient but abit over price. A good place for vegan. If you not eating onion, garlic & egg, inform their staff, they will exclude these ingredient.
4
Modern restaurant that offers creative and healthy vegetarian dishes that actually taste good and make you want to return for more. Some service staff come across as unattentive and inexperienced though.
1
Very Bad Service Staff VAN. A foreigner liar who tell big lies to customer in broad day light. It's such a waste that the management employ such a lousy staff with bad service.
5
If you are vegetarian, this is an amazing Italian western fusion restaurant with lots of choices, wonderful ambience and friendly staff. My husband and I took a 6 course meal each and it was too much food. Recommend taking the 4 course meal each, or ordering ala carte. Love the breadsticks, appetizer, salads and star burst pizza. Will definitely come back!
4
This came as a great surprise that vegetarian food could taste so fantastic. Cracking our heads to find a really nice dining spot for a farewell dinner for a vegetarian friend, this was a great find. Our Indian friend was even more surprised because she had never tasted such an array of flavourful food before. Well, as I always say, one person's food is another's poison, it all depends on what you are looking for.My friends and I went for the 3 course set meal (there is a four course if you want more) that was really filling! Honestly, the portions are generous thus some food may be shared if you are a petite eater.The ambience is lovely, the staff are very gracious, and the cost was mid-range. As for me, I am sure to visit again and actually, I am planning a healthy birthday dinner for my son in October. What a surprise it will be for him! :
3
Was here for a work lunch with colleagues. The menu looks super exciting and the variety is interesting - a lot of the dishes are mushroom based though, so for folks who don't like mushrooms, they will have limited choice. I tried the Macadamia Fruit Salad (very fresh with a gorgeous dressing), Oyster Mushroom Stone Pot Rice (just about passable), and the Roselle Jelly Yogurt (nice texture but on the blander side). It's probably worth one visit, but I'm unlikely to go back
5
I was surprised to see the crowd. You rarely see vegetarian restaurant to be full house. It's Italian cuisine. It tasted so good, even better than most Italian food. Try the pesto pasta & cloves pizza. Nice ambient too. But quite expensive. But everything in Singapore is expensive
4
The food was all yummy, and had good options. The food was nicely placed and the salads were good. The thin crust pizza was really good too. You'll probably do fine with just the 3 course meal. I had the 5 course meal and ended up taking my main dish home because I was full from everything else. Overall, good place to meet with friends
4
Taiwanese vegetarian restaurant chain offering something different. Very healthy and importantly tasty plant and fruit based cuisine. Service was efficient and quick. But let down by trainee cashier who 1) was rude 2) did not allow us to split bill - suspect she did know how 3) incorrectly entered the wrong amount $0 initially and 4) did not even say thank you. Informed manager who apologised and had a word with the trainee
4
We were pleasantly surprised with our visit to Sufood some days ago. We went in for the 5 course meal and later realised 3 course was probably good enough for light eaters like us. The salad had generous proportions and we really liked the taste. For main course the star pizza was much better than the pesto pasta option that we requested specially. Dessert sizes were smaller and so manageable. Overall a good eating experience! They can do with more servers - just Two that day and they had to cover too many people.
4
Interesting vegetarian food that did not have any of those "fake" meats. Food was interesting and tasty although price abit on the high side.
The taste of the mushroom soup is comparable to other high end restaurants. The salads were creative and very appetizing.
2
Salad was uninspiring and heavy on sauce. Pizzas were sludgy and we waited 15 minutes for them. Service was attentive and occasionally competent. Plates taken away before even finished eating last mouthful (general Singapore problem). Chrysanthemum tea was very good.
4
We have a vegetarian at the office. As his goodbye dinner we went to this place. Was a good experience. Most of the food is good to great quality. Service is good as well.
6 course lunch for $29++ is a good deal. Tasty food.
5
Spent 2.5 dinner there with friends. 13 friends in a table.
The service staffs was very polite and helpful and take care of all of our concerns.
3
Restaurant served good Vegetarian Food, would recommend the set course if you are a big eater. The food served are slightly innovative with the price at an affordable range. Maybe, you could try this once in a lifetime. But afterall, the taste, average. Will i revisit the restaurant? Meh, maybe not!
4
Had lunch on a weekday, with a friend. Got the set meal. Food was satisfactory, and well presented. Was not crowded, probably as it was a weekday. At the end of the 8 course meal, we were bloated and could barely finish the dessert. The highlights for me was their customer service. Well spoken, and checked with us before clearing the table for the next course. Checked with us, if we could consume garlic, onion before taking our orders. Recommended dishes that can omit garlic, even if stated in menu as otherwise. Had the pumpkin soup, but probably due to the fruit salad earlier, did not pair well and only took couple of sips. The service staff noticed this, and asked if anything was wrong and expressed my reasons that was too sweet for my taste. No valid reason to, but they offered to change to other soup variety which was nice of them. At first glance, set meal might seem pricey, but I do feel worth the value at the end of the meal
4
Bright, colourful and vibrant- these were the vibes we got on our first visit at this Taiwanese Italian-No meat restaurant! Ordered the 4-course set lunch menu: Soup, Main Course, Dessert & Beverage. (There's a 5- course set menu with additional Salad). Rosemary Breadsticks were complimentary and we picked our choices from the A la carte menu for all the set meal items.Highly recommend "Cream of wild mushroom soup with black truffles" for the soup and "Grain rice with mushroom and truffles" and "Lion's mane mushroom with black pepper sauce" for the main course.Desserts are good so depends on what you fancy having but the Crystal bean curd pudding is good.If you want a hot Beverage, go for the Yuzu Camomile tea.As always, I wud like to compliment a deserving service staff- I think she is the head server or outlet manager who patiently guided us thru the menu and made helpful recommendations.Overall, 4 Stars and definitely worth a repeat visit!
5
Amazing food and love the way they occasionally change their menu, their staffs never fail to make my day. However for a crowded place like this a lower cost is better we th crowd kill e atmosphere and we were so close to another couple that they can overlook what we were eating and talking about
4
One of the better modern vegetarian restaurants in town right now. The food leaves you pleasantly full without the usual psychologically hollow feeling you get after eating a vegetarian meal because you sense something is missing (namely meat!)Interesting selection of fusion dishes that are prepared in a refined manner and well presented. Extra bonus points for the attractively priced set meal.Service is a little inconsistent but nothing so jarring that it spoils the meal.Worth a repeat visit
3
Not sure why this place is so popular. There is only set menu here. 8 course meal if I remember correctly. Food is average, but there are too many people here, too noisy. Service is not good. I prefer Elemen @ Millinia Walk, food is much better & quieter
3
We ate here last night; ordered the set menu vegan. It was ok. My wife's main was nice and the soups too but overall fell short of our expectations. Nice people though and looked clean and tidy. Not sure I'd rush back.
5
Wouldn't say it is conducive for a chitchat gathering due to the crowd. However, food is undoubtedly good. Tried their wild mushroom tagtalie (not sure if I spelt it right), tasted superb!
4
We went to the Orchard road outlet, the food is good, the service is swift, the quantity is limited for the price.
3
It is strangely unique way of serving vegetarian in a fusion style and different from any other vegetarian restaurants. It is a low end and is served as a set meal.A waitress was nice when 3 of course were not really hungry but she recommends we can order two sets to share which we took her offer. We are impressed by the display in serving the meals. The appertiser were too small a portion.We were displeased when we request for an extra plate as there are 3 of us but were then told by another waitress it is because we ordered two sets. Huh we were shocked by her remarks and told her we were allowed in the first place. The food is rather average but interesting presentation and the portions were small. They were slow in serving and we left our our desserts thinking it is the end of the dinner
4
Love the started course with the rosemary bread stick and one of tomato jelly within 3 little dishes.Salad always choose for fruit...heard that have new menu add onSoup always choose for mushroom soupmain course always choose for star pizza..love the seaweed and wassabi....tasted yummy!Do not forget the delicious mango cake....with your juice or coffee or tea....wow!!!feel full at all !!
5
If you are averse to vegetarianism, this restaurant will probably change your mind.Courses are served to you in a degustation style and the presentation of each dish will make you forget that you are actually eating just vegetables and fruits. A feast for the eyes as well as stomach. Small shots of vegetable juices or mulberry tea are served in between each course.Though portions are small but by the time dessert comes around, you'll be struggling to stomach even the small slice of cake or sweet soup.All in all, I would consider eating here once in a while to break up the monotony of carnivorism as I am dubious about the benefits of the entire meal versus just a simple Caprese salad on occasion
4
I ate at this Taiwanese Fusion Vegetarian restaurant with friends last week. They chose this place basis reviews & the fact that I am a vegetarian. Their choice & the favourable reviews were absolutely bang-on! Even for a Thursday, the place was quite packed! But the service was very smooth.Beautiful presentation esp of the palate cleansers offered before the start of the meal. Esp the tomato in the jelly and the mulberry apple cider was to die for!We had taken the full course with a soup, salad, main, dessert & drink to sample all that the restaurant had to offer. My only reason for taking away 1 rating is because of the portion sizes. As we'd taken the full courses, smaller meal portions are recommended so the guest can appropriately enjoy the whole meal :) Also I'd taken the mac & cheese main, that was slightly average but the other mains ordered were lovely. And the salad with the strawberry dressing was too sweet for me and the dressing was more of a smoothie (perhaps to eat on its own)The dessert (mango one - forget the name) was so light and nice and not sweet to kill you.All in all the next time in Singapore, I will definitely look it up again
4
Must go place for vegetarians. Amazing variety of food . Splendid taste. But staff are a bit biased and racist. Poor service ans no smile on the face. But a big thumbs up for the food....gone twice due to food taste but put off by the staff's bad attitude
3
And affordable too! For approximately SGD26 one can get the 5-course menu (which includes a different blend of juices). Overall the meal was not exceptional, but it was good enough. I tried the pear and yucca juice. It was not bad, but I wished I had asked for coffee instead to go with the mango dessert (mango frollino). The dessert was quite sweet. I like the texture of the cake. It was firmer than mousse consistency, but it was softer and more moist than sponge cakes.The fruit baked rice was quite yummy, but I wish it was cheesier. The salad dressing was too acidic. The appetizers were unremarkable. I quite liked the radish with the berry sauce, but the radish was a bit slimy.Overall it was a nice alternative vegetarian lunch
5
I went with my partner who is not a vegetarian and he came out so happy and satisfied with the food! We got the 8 course for such a great price and such great food and the staff were very helpful! Recommend for vegetarians and non vegetarian. Food good enough for all!
3
I'm going to the 1 in Wheelock.
First thing...no WIFI ☺.
Ordering a lunch package. Onion soup just very so so. Won't be back for that. The Ferulo Pesto pasta is not bad. The yuzu chamomile tea is a little different than normal chamomile tea.
2
Hi, I am a regular customer of Sufood. Yesterday I was going to introduce my Sister in law to go there to eat. But we was rejected on the spot even though the resturant was quite empty only about one quarter of the tables was full. Was told that the waitress and waiters was busy. We have to wait till 8pm and we was there at 7:35pm. I say we can wait but at least can we go in and sit since there are empty tables they say no, no reason was given.  normally unless the restaurant is full house than they will reject diners. I dun know what happen but definitely I'm not going there again
5
Found this amazing Taiwanese chain of vegetarian restaurant on the recommendation of the concierge at "Swissotel".+ Refreshing Vegetarian Fare+ Great Value Deals on a Set Menu of 8 course+ Good Food ; loved the starters and the drinks+ Value for Money+ Extremely good and attentive serviceWill positively recommend to family and friends
4
My 1st visit to this restaurant. I am not a vegetarian but love vegetarian food. I have yet to come across a vegetarian restaurant that serve flavourful food except a Japanese vegetarian restaurant at Bras Basah. This is the 2nd restaurant that I will consider bringing my friends over. Their theme is Italian. All 4 of us ordered the restaurant set dinner. The cider n bread was free flow. The presentation of each dish was very thoughtful. Some dish dressing was extraordinary even by non vegetarian standard. The dinner set meal was value for money. We went on a Friday evening (we called to book) and the restaurant were packed when we arrived. I guess that was a good sign for anyone that stepped in for the 1st time. The 1 thing that i would recommemd to the restaurant is the noise level created by other diners. There was a big group of diners sitting behind a partition that made so much noise till we can't even hear ourselves talking. That was how noisy it was in the restaurant. I didn't take any pictures initially but after the appetiser I couldn't help but to take out my hp and started clicking so that I could show my friends how good the food was. Keep up the good work. I will definately visit this restaurant again. The apps only allowed me to upload 10 pics hence not all pics are here. Pls take note the cesar salad didn't have macadamia nuts. We added it ourselves.
4
Like the concept of have a 8-course set meal with small portion each. Best of all, other than the appetizer and the breadstick, diners are able to select the other dishes in the set. There is rather a good selection under each category. The mushroom salad and the Wild Mushroom Charcoal Tagliatelle were nice. Friend's Baked Potato Al Funghi, Porcini Pasta and Star Pizza were delicious too. Worth the visit
5
I know they have a set menu, but I managed to order a salad and the curry cheese pizza to go. (I didn't want all the food in a set.) They have some delicious and unique looking items on the menu and the curry cheese pizza was no exception. Essentially more like a curried potato inside of a flat bread. Spicy and delicious, and very unique. My only regret is that there were other vegetarian restaurants I wanted to try and I never got an opportunity to go back to Sufood!If you are a vegetarian in Singapore, I definitely recommend stopping at one of their locations. This one, in Raffles City, was a bit hard to find in a back corner, but it's worth it!
5
Brought my mum to eat the vegan option here during their promotion period and she was impressed by the setting and grandeur of the place. I love the setting and that they have vegan options. I would recommend this place to bring your loved ones if you have all not been here before. However, I would not frequent this place as the price is too expensive
3
Of late more trendy vegen restuarant starts popping up in Singapore.Had the opportunity to try SuFood for dinner with family. Clean place, bright lighting dinning area with great diversity of waiters and waitresses.Crowd are mostly younger lots.The.menu looked very unfamiliar to a typical vegen restuarant so we didn't have any expectation of the food as well.Food type looks italian with pizza type menu. We ordered a few other dishes as well but really could not remembered what we had the very next day (LoL)I also didnt think the food taste was spectacular or had any unique taste to it.Overall a pleasant experience with the family
5
Just stumbled across this really fine non-meat restaurant while browsing for vegetarian food. I was searching online for birthday celebration venue for my boss and one of the colleagues cannot consume meat. Excellent food display - you can see from the photos. Excellent service by the staff as they were attentive and polite. We secretly bought a birthday cake for our boss and the staff were prompt and enthusiastically sang birthday song with us. We had a really pleasant lunch experience with great ambience and food display. And filling too. We had the lunch express set - comes with drink, dessert, main and appetizers at SGD25++ (cant really recall exact amount).Some remarks - the aircon can be stronger as we felt abit warm. and also the down ward point spot light was bit bright and feels warm
2
Went with family on a weekend lunch to Raffles City branch. Waiter was not able to recommend any food (he doesnt know, never tried the food before; should be ok - was the type of response).Dessert comes 20mins after the repeated request to expedite, we ended up doddling on the mahjong paper table cloth to kill time.Pumpkin soup was too sweet, oNion soup was too watery. Most of the menu was made of mushroom, could be more creative.Likely not going there again
4
very good. value for money. but limited menu. will get bored after few tries. personalised service. good for casual or business meals.
5
A must visit for vegetarians and non-vegetarians. Unique drinks and food items presented in a wonderful way. An amazing experience for a mall restaurant. Highly recommended.
4
Nice place to have gathering with friends. The set comes in 8 course meal. Nice to enjoy if you have plenty of time to eat slowly. For business meeting, Sufood at Wheelock is a better choice ( quieter)I would say it's above average price for a meal, but you do get quality food
4
My last visit was in March 2016. I have been visiting the frequently whenever I'm meeting my Friends. I favor the soup, breadstick and the mains. From experience, I have bought my non-vegetarian friends to Sufood and most of the friends like the food as well. No Mock meat
4
The slim young people who work at luxury goods companies at Wheelock Place or Liat Towers are spoiled with so many healthy eating options - SuFood is NewBlood on the block at Wheelock B2. It serves good Italian-inspired vegetarian dishes. At excellent value too - the 3-course set lunch (plus a complimentary salad during opening promotion period) costs $15++, and the 5-course dinner is only $21.80++. Although I don't like salty food, I find the dishes a bit under-seasoned, but nothing that some Tabasco sauce cannot cure! So, no need to be distracted by the fragrance of the combo phở (with beef brisket, balls, tendon, tripes and raw beef) or of the roasted pork belly bánh mì coming from the neighbouring restaurant! Friendly service; efficient ordering by mini-iPad
5
Finding vegetarian food is not the easiest in Singapore & then when one finds a pure vegetarian place with great variety and tasty food, its is truly out of the world. Firstly they have a great spread across each category - starter, soup, salad, main course and desserts. It is an eclectic mix of asian cuisine, italian, healthy. You get rooty stuff, saucy stuff, fresh stuff - need I say more : do not miss it.
5
A Singaporean friend took me out to lunch at this restaurant. The setting is very modern, with a lot of white plastic and bright colours. Not quite my cup of tea but definitely stylish. The food was amazing and inexpensive. The cuisine is modern style vegetarian, with a lot of innovative combinations of taste and aroma. The food is well prepared and definitely enough. The service was very friendly and quick despite a full restaurant
4
Was roaming around in Citihall and saw an advertisement (meat less Italian food). Earlier I was planning to go Indian food but changed last minute to try out.Menu was short and simple with pictures so easy to understand.Ordered few items and it came out to be same as it was displayed in the menu. First impression was very good.Service was good and very clean and hygienic place.Food was tasty. Quantity also not bad.Little pricy but we enjoyed the Colourful and tasteful food. Will go there again and recommend it to others.Overall very good
5
We went as a family of 4 with our local friends, a family of 3. The vibe is very modern and bustling - need to book ahead! The menu is interesting as you get bread, salad (4 choices), soup (4 choices), starter, main course (12 choices), dessert (4 choices) and a drink (7 choices) for S$30 each. The food is a mix of Chinese and Italian selections. The serving size of the main courses were a good size - some of the ladies could not finish everything. The service was very friendly and efficient. A wonderful experience all around.
4
A very busy place with a very interesting take on pure vegetarian food. The dishes, the preparation, the decor all deserve a mention in this review. The food was very good and seemed to be prepared with care. A must visit for everyone who loves good food.
5
Food and it's presentation was impressive, with the waiters explaining every food they serve and how you go about eating it. Portions were relatively large. One set meal (includes appetiser main course and desert) was about S$30.
5
The restaurant offers 6 courses set meal at $29.80++ plus drinks. The choices are great and worth to try.
3
If you are tired of meats, come here for a change of your palate. Most dishes are light. Nice Asian style deco. I like the appetizer the most...
3
Had dinner with a vegetarian calzone. Not bad. Would have liked some vegan options on the menu but overall I had a pleasant experience. Not cheap I must say though.
3
Had our company Xmas lunch at Sufood. We arrived at around 12noon and all of us ordered the Xmas set lunch. The food is above average and considered really good for vegetarian food. However the serving is so slow... It took about an hour to serve between dishes and the main dish was only served 2.5 hours later. As a result, we only finish our lunch at 3pm
4
A really good concept - choose from a wide menu choices for a set number of courses, and all for a set price (very reasonable). The food is very well cooked and presented. Friendly and knowledgable staff, with very efficient service. The decor is bright and modern
4
My colleague introduced me to this restaurant. It is consider newly open with Italian Vegetarian meal. The best to experience it is to have the full 8 courses set meal. You definitely be full after the full set.It started with Starter, bread with dip & cider. All is great especially the bread. Salad is standard. For soup i had french onion and cheese, taste good but slightly salty to me. Main i had Baked Potato Al Funghi, this is really nice. Desserts i had panna cotta and drink i had The Ashitaba. so far my experience is good. The menu used a lot of mushroom ingredients, if you not a mushroom person, you might find less interesting on the menu
5
Was brought here by a friend and we had their Express Set for lunch.I was taken by surprise by its location and its very bright and pretty ambience. Chic and clean, lovely!Our waiter came along quickly and did his best to provide us with all the information we needed to decide what we should eat. Our food started to arrive quite soon after we ordered. Their appetizer was truly refreshing and indeed got us wanting for more. Every one of the 3 pieces of appetizer was very good with the savory cherry tomato jelly being the best for me.My next dish was the Mushroom Salad and its was great. Loved every bit of it. I'll admit I'm a sucker for mushrooms but this dish was just oh so good!For the main dish I had the Calzone and oh me gosh, it was huge! And very tasty! I tried my best to finish it but only managed to get just past half of it. The waiter quickly offered to pack the rest for me to take home. And yes, the waiter kept checking on us every now and then to see if we needed anything and if everything was okay. Great service!For dessert I had the Black Sesame Panna Cotta which frankly at first I was a bit worried would be unlike the usual Panna Cottas you get at most Italian joints, but it was in fact very very good and smooth. Couldn't get enough of it!!Cappucino was very nice and a great close to an awesome meal of true veges that tasted and looked fantastic!We had made a reservation and while it was not crowded when I first got there at 12.30pm on a weekday, it was soon full to the brim. Best to make a reservation in advance if you are planning to go during lunch.Will definitely be back
4
Sufood changes my impression of vegetarian food. The food is a fusion of Italian and japanese style cuisine. It will be more worth the value to order the set menu especially 1 for 1 during promotion with the use of certain credit card. I simply love the starter and the rosemary breadsticks with mustard dip. I go for classic garden salad. For soup I usually choose root soup (more Chinese style with lotus root, ginkgo nuts, cashew nuts, arrow root, etc) or pumpkin soup. Main can be quite filling. I usually choose Star Pizza. If you are a small eater, you can just order 1 set menu and the rest ala-carte. Not to forget, apple cedar vinegar really whets my appetite. And this year I have visited the restaurant thrice already. Crowded during weekends so best to book in advance
4
First of all, I am a omnivore convert. I do not eat vegetables until the age of 13. To me, vegetarian cruisine in Singapore is mainly gluten and oily vegetables. Sufood has changed my perception of Vegetarian Cruisine by using fungi, vegetables and fruits creatively in their dishes. Tips: The portions served for the set meal are huge. If you are a small eater and not comfortable to waste a considerable amount of food, it will make more sense to order ala carte dishes than ordering the set meal.
3
Reasonable price with SDG30 per set course. Nice decoration but confined area, too noisy when full-house. Recommend to reserve your table in advance.
4
Interesting to find a vegetarian restaurant in a shopping mall in Singapore. Food was good but service disappointing. If I go for lunch with someone then I expect to eat with them and both of us to have hot food. There was a 5 minute gap between them bringing my wife's meal and mine, which is just not good enough. I will re-iterate that the food was good, and the value for money was good. There was plenty of staff around so I can only assume it was bad communication or bad planning in the kitchen
4
When entering the restaurant I had not paid much attention to the type of food they serve: "Italian inspired vegetarian"! Since the restaurant is brand new in Raffles City, I wanted to try it out. The place is quite spacious with a seating capacity of about 140 they told me. The dÃ©cor is modern and uses pleasant light colors.The food obviously is vegetarian. But my impression was very positive: for 35 Sin$ TTC they offer a very complete menu (consisting of several small hors d'oeuvres. a small salad, soup, main, dessert and drinks; all courses except the hors d'oeuvres have numerous choices). For a glass of wine add 12 Sin$ ++ The food was light and very tasty.In summary, even if you happen not to be a vegetarian the restaurant may make a welcome break in your everyday's 'steak-poultry-fish' routine. I plan to go back sometime, though possibly not tomorrow
4
Came here to celebrate a birthday and their service was GREAT! Experienced a new vegetarian dining, their charcoal pasta was sumptous so were the pizza. As one of my friends is a strict vegan, request to alter the food is easily requested and granted. Requested to top up the rosemary breadstick and cranberry drink is also accomodated. They provided complimentary birthday cake slice as well. And their birthday song is so cute and adorable. very good serivce
5
Never really been a fan of vegetarian food- not that I dislike vegetables (though I do hate tomatoes) but I greatly abhor fake veggie meat, ewwz! As such, I was a little skeptical about dining at Sufood. As it turns out, I had nothing to worry about!The food tasted really, really good. I had the 8-course set meal and everything from the appetizer to the dessert was just WOW. Totally blew my mind- the presentation of the food, the tantalizing taste, yum! So spoilt! I would definitely like to go back again - this time bringing my mum - to try the other dishes; they have such a great variety!P.S. We did make a reservation + we went an at odd time so the restaurant was really not all that full

Tried Sufood for the first time this weekend on a friends recommendation. actually you really need to book, this place gets full up real quick. The lady at the front by the name of Heeda was fabulous, she informed us that the restaurant was full but if we could be out in an hour, we could get in.....she was great!We sat down and looked at the menu, same menu at Taiwan, pretty much. It all costs about Sin$30.00 all up for the many course experience.....Lots of choices......i am not a veggie but my mates are.....i have to say, the food was great and the choices were good even for a non veggie. Out waiter was a brilliant guy called Vans......he looked after us very well explaining the concept, the food etc. Great guy....Thanks Vans for making our evening!! He also has a really good sense of humour.....which is actually hard to find in Singapore (Very stressed out society that place!!!)Over all, a good experience. You have to try the pizzas, great job and the soups.I hope this place succeeds as its a veggie place with a difference but make sure you make a booking or you will be turned away

We first visited in Feb 2015 during Valentine's eve, and has since addicted to their food. We visited another 2 times within the next 3 months, and everytime we will be ordering their Star Pizza! If you order the set menu, it will serves you eight course starting from appetizer all the way to dessert. When the appetizer is served, you might be wondering such small portion you will probably need to order 2 sets, but actually all the food portion (main course, soup, salad) are just nice for 1 person. Start Pizza a must try, it has seaweeds, ham and topped with green color sauce (if I recalled correctly, it's wasabi sauce), which actually enhance the pizza taste. Trust me, you will not regret! Recommended to book in advance as it's always full during dining hour. Located in Raffles City, City Hall MRT station

Quite impressed by their unique selection. All food are tasty and very appealing. They have an eight course set and an express set for lunch. Personally, I think the express set with appetiser, soup/salad, main course, dessert and drink is good value and just right portion. All my friends enjoyed their selection. It's quite a nice surprise as I don't usually go to vegetarian restaurants. A good place to try out with friends

First time visit. Very clean and bright white interior. Mostly set menu else Ala Carte will be too expensive. Food comes in sequence and as clock work. You get to choose from options in the set menu by courses. I really enjoyed this experience. Might visit again but food is simple and tasty but does not beg for repeat visits. Maybe I'd bring my vegetarian friends there.

Wanna to give the current 1 for 1 high tea promotion a try. Turned up at 2pm+ with my family but was turned away. Even when I expressed I am OK to pay with non-promotion prices, the cashier say they are no longer accepting patrons at a non-apologetic tone. I can only say this restaurant serves with an attitude

I like how the entire meal felt so clean and fresh unlike typical vegetarian food in Singapore that can be quite oily and salty. I really like the MACARONI ALFREDO CASSEROLE! Pictures from my visit can be found at my blog entry here: http://floraisabelle.com/sufood-singapore/

Sufood has an impressive array of healthy and tasty vegetarian food. Processed food items such as mock meat is kept to a minimum without compromising on the taste. My only complaint is that the portion is slightly too large!

the menu is same as taiwan. taste taiwan better, service of course cannot compare to tw. price is reasonable, not many people during dinner time, no queue at all. recommend for people want to try something new. the portion is enough to make u full.

The restaurant serves a "set meal", with four or five options for each course.Service was good. We were a party of 8 or so, including young kids, and altough the place was full, service was prompt.Menu is a mix of European, Asian, everything.Food is interesting, and good

We visited sufood this noon for lunch and had the festive menu priced at sgd 50/head...inclusive of 2 housepour wines/ free flow of fresh juice....so perhaps pricey given that it was the new year First things first, excellent friendly staff, the three ladies who took care of our table.This is a child friendly place in a mall setting..Fresh good food, very well presented... A good range of options in the set menu... Portions are nice and visually stimulating..main courses are quite sumptous..There is an asian touch to the Italian cuisine...not surprising as this is a taiwanese chain....Two young kids could easily share a single main course or a kids set meal.The free flow of good quality veg and fruit juice as wellas the mulberry vinegar juice is a nice tough. Italian House wines were quire drinkableThis place has a nice friendly buzz and i would definitely visit again.Tips to the restaurant management- sugarfree juices would be preferable given- a word to confirm that the bills are to b e paid at the counter would help as we waited a while post our dessert and felt unattended till we finally checked on the settlement procedur

Lets start with the good points:I like the concept - vegetarian and vegan - not enough of these places aroundFood presentation is not too shabby and the quality of it was OK, not ground breaking stuff, but palatableStaff were extremely friendly and as helpful as they could be within their knowledge baseDevelopment areas:Just because it's Christmas Eve, don't force the Christmas menu on us.....which happens to be a double the usual price set menuTrain your staff to know what is in the dishes and have them speak clearly so that what they are guessing is in the dish is at least audible to the earIf you offer a free flow juice with the forced set menu.....then give us this juice! Don't wait till we're three quarters of the way through the meal to then wait for us to ask for our juiceI guess that's their economical way of saving money by allowing us to fill up on food firstHere's a great tip - if your customer is still eating their starter - don't try to take it away from themSecondly - just because your chef has prepared the mains already, don't force that on our table so that it gets cold whilst we're still eating our starters!!Would I return......possibly when it's not during public holidays......possibl

I went here with my family(25th-Nov-14) when we were on outing and window shopping, no reservation was done, immediately after I entered and been seated, waitress provided a bowl of carrot with pumpkin soup for my daughter with bread stick. She liked very much and never expect in sudden.We opt for the 8course menu presented one by one which was different/unique and tasty. Waitress were in touch then and there in between and never forgot to ask about the food. Food was tasty and the way they presented was marvelous,Restaurant was mostly filled with family and couple.Seems like expensive,but worth to it. Sincerly appreciate if they would have open more outlets

I'm always a carnivore, we came here only to accommodate a vegetarian friend. Before browsing through the menu, I've always thought it's a chinese vegetarian restaurant like any other vegetarian restaurants in town. But no, it's a delicate western cuisine, with 5 course meal, from appetizers to desserts. Hence, this is really new to us.It's interesting to have the vegetarian in western style. The price is quite reasonable, a 4 course meal (appetizer, soup/salad, main, dessert and drink) cost only $18 per set. 5 course meal (appetizer, soup, salad, main, dessert and drink) cost $25. However, due to the strict vegetarian diet, the food are cooked without garlic. Therefore, the taste is a little bland for me. The worse part of the dining is the service. We visited the restaurant in a big group, about 13 of us. And the waiter kept forgetting our order, served the wrong food etc. And for some of us, the food took so long to come. The entire lunch took us about 2 hours. We were all very hungry people, and a bit cranky.Still, I think it's a good new variations for the vegetarians in town

I would say Cuisine from Sufood is the best "vegetarian" food that I ever had.I always against the idea of having vegetarian food that made of starch and look like "chicken", fish or meat. Food at Sufood is healthy, nicely presented. I love the pizza. The price is very affordable. Nice atmosphere. A good place for meeting
