Used to be better in terms of food. Truffle fries was better last year. But service was good. Was hoping that the Brunch menu can be extended to dinner timing.
5
Food was presentable and tasty. Staffs were very heart warming and friendly despite long wait for my lychee cake due to system error missing out this particular item.
4
love the desserts here. n nett prce with water! nice staff and cool decor. i would highly recommend this place for family or friends.
5
Excellent in food...
Excellent in service...
Excellent in atmosphere...
Excellent in all ways...
Highly recommended to all...

Good place for gathering on weekdays. Food and ambience are good. Convenience place in heartland. Service is good!
4
Visited lola’s More than 5 times now. Be prepared to queue but they have since expanded their cafe so the next door unit is for seating as well. Food served fresh and appealing!
2
Perhaps they are good for brekkie. The food we ordered, none of us really like it. Would say the price is slightly cheaper compared to the usual Cafe, that’s it.
2
Always had dessert and coffee here. One night my Friend and I decided to have dinner here and was left in shock. The Nachos Cheese Fries was great! A tad salty but nevertheless yummy! Eat it while it’s hot! The mains however fell short, slow cooked pork with truffle mash was a microwaved bowl disaster. And their fish and chips although it looked appetising the batter was completely tasteless. I was curious what others thought about the food here and went to read up on reviews and concluded that we came on a very bad day. Chef was probably down with the flu or something. Service was slow but there was this one guy that made an effort to ask how was everything and actually took off one dish from our bill and apologised about the food.

It's not a chilled place. The noise inside is constantly loud with chatter and high turnover as it is crowded. There's mostly, a queue but not a long wait to be seated. Not recommended if you want a quiet and relaxed meal.No covered shelter from the nearest Kovan Mrt station. Bring an umbrella in case it rains
5
Meal: Ordered a long black and Crab Cake Egg Benedict. It is a perfect brunch combination. Flavourful and delicious. Ambience: It's a small but cosy cafe atmosphere. The table is comfortable for two and it is a stool sit down place. But I was very pleasantly surprised when the staff changed my seat to a chair with a back (on request) and they brought a cushion. See these are the gestures and care makes it worth it. Cost: Reasonably priced for Kovan area. ($$
5
I think Lola’s has changed their menu since the last time I went there. Tried the stewed pork with truffle mash and my friend had fish and chips! Both were good (: their cakes were really delicious too
4
Great value for money ,nice delicious food and great ambience certainly aplace to enjoy ur evening ,highly recommeded
4
One of my favourite cafes to go to for gatherings with frens. Food is great, and prices remain pocket-friendly even after expansion to next door unit!
5
Ambience of the restaurant was awesome. Food was beyond expectations. Staffs were friendly and cheerful. Makes our day.
4
The tables are way too small so uncomfortable overall and not cozy. Chicken wings and chocolate cake are nice.
4
Had the Spicy Swimmer Crab and Braised Pull Pork, both are so good especially the first dish! Staff service is very prompt and good too. Definitely going back to visit again!
4
Coffee and orange almond cake were delicious. The staffs were lovely. What more can I say. If you are in this area and looking for somewhere to go to eat, give this place a go, you won’t be disappointed.
5
Very nice food at acceptable price and atmosphere was great and friend staffs were friendly. We went for brunch and though my reservation was 3pm which was the timing they end brunch, they even called me earlier to ask me to come earlier before their last order for brunch closes at 3pm
5
It’s chilly so dropped by to have a simple dinner. Order crab pasta (spicy) and the taste is still as good ($18)Chicken wings (a must order dish) $10, is yummy as well. Husband will always order his favourite sausage food, sigh, boring man. ($12)My son ordered fish and chips, fries is the best!!! ($16)The food is always in high standard, so you won’t feel disappointed at all.Payment by cash and nets only
1
I will make this short and sweet........Lola's is : Over priced Cramped Terrible service Average foodWe only live a stones throw from Lola's , so we were happy to see such a popular cafe so close to our condo . But unfortunately our first visit will be our last . I am always amazed how Singaporeans flock to places because they think it is trendy, even if the food is overpriced and average , and Lola's cafe ticks all those boxes. One great thing about living at Kovan , there are plenty of places to eat , so crossing Lola's off our list is no loss
5
Staff were really nice and friendly. Will be back again this year. The food portion was reasonable for the price.
4
First time trying lola though heard many gd reviews.
good value without gst n svc but svc was still good.
portion was generous too!
4
Avocado with eggs benedict and pulled pork, honey paprika wings are a must order! They removed the avocado for me as per my request. Good service
5
Service is good. Kept checking if we have enough water. Wings is nice, just that I can't taste the truffle in the truffle fries.
4
Staffs are attentive and polite. Reservation was made easily. Foods are served pretty fast. Will come back again
5
It was our nth time here and the quality of food remains the same. It is still delicious. The chicken wings is a must try. The dessert are excellent. I recommend the lemon meringue tart. One of the best here in Singapore. There are a lot of cakes available as well. Alcoholic drinks are served as well. Late night, they would serve desserts and drinks only. Expect queues as well during peak hours. All worth the wait
3
It's not my first time at Lola's but the staff this time around have been rather lagging. We were seated and asked for menu at least 3 times before anyone finally came with a menu and, yet another few times before anyone came to take our orders
5
Lola after. All my visits never dissapointsI amma creature of habbits. That never change a winning concept and the cheese fries and honey wings are absolute. Best for me cant go wrong with it my wife loves the pulledpork sandwich the best. Only reason we not come everyweek is that its little of our route Else we most def do it
4
Directions: NEL Line to Kovan MRT station, take Exit B and walk straight ahead after you exit all the way to the traffic light and you’ll see the big signboard across the roadA small cosy hipster cafe, the ambience is generally cosy, service staff are young but still professional and friendly. But towards the end I found them a little too eager to clear our plates and table that made me wonder if they are just being service oriented or indirectly hinting for us to leave soon.Food wise it’s pretty decent, typical cafe fare and cafe pricingTheir Christmas Berry Ale, a festive special, was quenching for a super blitzing hot day!The Honey Paprika Wings are a must order! Nicely fried without too much batter and not oily at all. Will be hard to resist more!They are very generous with the cheese along with a dash of Paprika for the Nacho Cheese fries.The Crab Cake Benedict is a must order too. The poached egg is very well done with a runny center, the hollandaise sauce is also just sufficient. I’m a big fan of crab cakes though this one isn’t as good as Marmalade Pantry’s but was a good combination with the poach egg and English Muffin base.The Sea Salt Chocolate Tart with Coffee Cream was not bad too. Didn’t quite taste the Espresso in the cream but the Chocolate Tart was good on its own.Overall a good place to have brunch. Reservations are a must especially for weekends, they seemed packed the whole time we were there
5
Booked at 7:30pm, went to the cafe slightly before 7 and requested to sit in earlier. Was surprised to know that our seats have been reserved even though the cafe was about to get packed. Love the food, ambience and the service provided by the staff. Would definitely come here again.
3
Nothing to shout about. Food is acceptable and prices are slightly on the high side. Most negative aspect of the meal was the overly salty hollandaise sauce.
4
Tried the crab linguine for brunch. Theres a generous amount of crab and it is really very nice!! Service can be improved but overall, it was a very pleasant experience :)
4
Loved their Basil Mushroom Pesto Toast. Staff were attentive to customers. One of them even offered a backrest for us.
5
Good food with affordable prices. The croissant was exceptionally delicious! Booking was done easily on chope.
4
We ordered the beef burger. Very tasty beef patty. Even the bread bun was very good. Comes with a sunny side up egg. Side of fries was a bit bland though.
4
Located walking distance from Kovan MRT.. they offer Brunch Menu from 10am-3pm. They close brunch menu exactly 3pm and starts dinner Menu at 6pm
3pm-6pm only starters desserts and drinks are available.
5
Awesome brunch. but very packed.Love their earl grey banana cake and the sesame tart. Book early to avoid disappointment.
4
Went there for brunch - we made reservations earlier, and the waiter led us to our seats. Order was taken and food/drinks served pretty efficiently. Food was good (we had pulled pork egg Benedict, basil pesto sandwich, croissant with scrambled eggs), and coffee was not bad (but had better coffee in other similar cafes). Overall a good experience (and will certainly visit again), although I feel it’s a bit pricey for the types of food and coffee
4
It’s our first visit and we loving it ! The friendly staff recommended me the Ultimate croissant 14 and my wife ordered a different menu ( Honey chicken salad ??) and each a hot latte. They are very impressive !The deco is simple but cozy with an affordable price. We find many teenagers in this place and I guess they likely come by MRT. Car parking is quite limited this area
4
Went there on a weekend evening and was relatively crowded. The cafe placed quite a fair bit of tables in their small venue. It is a bit squeezy and was a bit noisy.On the other hand, the food is not bad. We tried the chicken wings and it was pipping hot! We also had a pork stew with truffle mashed potato. It is good but can be a little overwhelming. Good for sharing between 3~4 pax though.Overall was satisfied
4
The food is of pretty good quality. Not a lot of variety but can be sure that it will be good. Will go again
3
Food used to be better. After the change in the menu, the main dishes are not as good. The wings and natcho cheese fries are still good though.
4
Never fail to satisfy my brunch cravings! Delicious as ever. Tried their earl grey banana cake too and loved the combi.
5
Lovely experience at the cafe, reached early but we were given a seat inside. Service is on point too, prompt and
5
Good food at good value. Service was good . Went on a Friday night and it was not so packed. Reasonable price.
4
Staff were friendly. The lemon tart and chai latte were great. Nice Friday afternoon spent at Lola's Cafe.
5
This is my 3rd time back at Lola. I am always craving for their bangers and mash and crispy wings. The prices are average amping other cafes and the portion is reasonable. Service is prompt.
5
Love the ham and egg crossaint, and the honey chicken wings! Completed it with sakaura green tea. Best brunch!
Prices are net; no gst or service charge.
Highly recommended!
4
Visited with two young children and the staff was very patient, even had coloured cups for the children. Even though the cafe ran out of plates they gave us plastic plates. Food came fast and was yummy.
3
The cafÃ© was crowded as usual. Initial service and order taking was prompt.When we tried to add on more orders (for dessert) later on, even though there were a lot of waiters standing around (doing nothing), none of them bothered to look up or walk around.Food-wise, we ordered pulled pork, teriyaki chicken grain bowl, croissant, nacho cheese fries, bangers and mash and latte with soya milk and cold brew.All tasted great except for the latte (coffee is a bit off). Cold brew was smooth and cooling. 
4
Food is delicious and service is great. Great place to enjoy a hearty brunch, would recommend coming on weekdays when it is less crowded.
4
Visited on a Saturday Brunch. Food items were limited but were yummy. Not a place for catchup as it will get noisy during peak hours.
4
This is one of my favourite cafes because the food is good and value for money. The honey wings are a must to eat! We also enjoyed the braised pork and mash... Will definitely go back again!
5
Excellent food and services.
Will visit the cafe again with friends.
Enjoy the nice brew coffee and cakes.
5
Good food and the price is reasonable. I personally loved the slow braised pork and mashed potato ordered by my girlfriend. I ordered Lolas Beef Burger due to it’s sunny shine egg.
5
The food there is really good especially the wings and the fries! The special display of the chai tea soy milk latte entice me too! Strongly recommend the place 👍🏻
5
Lola’s Cafe is almost always full especially at the weekend and Sundays are no different. A Long queue was outside when we got there around 8pm so we settled for takeaway cakes. I didn’t have the cakes but the kids seemed pleased with them. What struck me was the great service even for just three pieces of cake. Smiles, pleasantries such a freshness to the whole process. Hope to be back for a proper sit down meal some day. Keep up the good work
4
There's designated time for Lunch (till 3pm) and Dinner (from 6pm). Thus, if you're heading down for lunch or dinner, do make sure you go within those timeslots. Otherwise, you can choose items from their Small Bites and Desserts. I would think that most people do go there for their deserts because it's real yummy. This is the second time I've been there and their dessert has not failed me. Not that impressed with their pasta though. Most people are more impressed with their pull-pork. I'll reserve that for the next time.
5
I went to Lola's with a group of friends for dinner. We especially enjoyed their honey wings and nacho fries! Have tried their brunch menu before as well and generally prefer their main courses served during lunch over dinner. Nonetheless the food served was great and we enjoyed the atmosphere in the cafe too
4
Was here after some sports with friends and I find it to be a nice place to chill and have some finger food and drinks. The selection is decent, but mainly there are good choices of coffee and craft beers as well.While we were here before proper dinner begins, we had the chance to try out their finger food and really, the nachos cheese fries are deadly.. GOOD! Expect me to return soon again
4
4 stars for the coffee and service. Good microfoam. Thanks for not burning the milk, yet hot enough coffee. Coffee art can be improved. Will still come back for the coffee.
Friendly and attentive staff.
3
Have not been back for quite awhile, food is better before. The pull pork avocado eggs bendedict were salty.
5
Food and ambience was good but the tea refill was lukewarm... cosy ambience they opened the next door unit on weekends hence it wasnt that crowded as their main unit and crammed.
4
Service was great despite the huge crowd! :) Food was really good, but the fries were a letdown as they were overly fried and too oily.
5
Great food, great value. Super service from the staff. Thanks Lola's for a wonderful time! Will be back!
4
Presentation of food is good. Staff are friendly and attentive. Food is served quickly. Ambience is nice and quiet but that really depends on which time of the day you visit the cafe.
5
Ambience, food, drinks and service... Generally everything is fantastic! We went on a weekday during off peak hours. Otherwise, expect a long queue to get in.
5
It's a nice place to hang out with family and friends. good atmosphere and food. Worth to go, did not regret.
5
We lucked out and waited no longer than 10 minutes for our table (even though we shared). The crab cake Benedict was fantastic! The crab cake wasn't dry whatsoever and the egg was cooked perfectly. The sauce wasn't too overpowering. I would recommend!The wings were also delicious. We ordered the honey paprika wings, which were also delicious. If you can, get the truffle fries on the side also. We were not disappointed.Note: no wifi... come on, Singapore
4
Order the Bangers & Mash per other's recommendations It didn't disappoint at all. Also had the Crispy wings. The meat is tender. But because we have started on our main & only had it later, the taste of the wings was blunted.For main, my family ordered Aglio Olio, Fish & Chips, Truffle Mushroom Cream Linguine & Slow Braised Pork & Truffle Pommes Puree. The Braised Pork was a tad dry, though it is immersed in thick sauce. Linguine is good but I like the Aglio Olio best, as there is a tinge taste of herb to add that extra zing.The service was attentive & different waiter took the initiatives to help us capture our moments at different occasions
4
We had the mushroom toast and chicken wings. The chicken wings were indeed the best. I thought the toast portion was quite filling though. Overall, service was fast and efficient.
5
Prompt service and food was served hot!!!! will definitely be back! Service staff were really friendly too!
4
The mash at Lola's cafe is to-die for!!! The breakfast bowl is great for people who love a good herby stew.
4
Food was great; they changed the food items from their menu though. I prefer the food they offered in the past. Everything else was great, other than the fact that I think the tables could be further apart. Their service was brilliant.
5
Lola's Cafe has been serving up wallet-friendly yet delicious food ever since it opened and never fails to disappoint. 10/10 would return :)
5
Iced Mocha was good. Not too acidic.
Truffle linguine was yummy & does not get "jelat" although we couldn't really smell the truffle.
Cheese fries was okay but not fantastic.
Honey paprika wings were alright.
Overall, an 8/10 still.
5
My family had dinner one day. Nice service, delicious food with a reasonable price! Definitely will come back for dessert 👍🏻
3
Two-third of the cafe was already filled with customers at 10am in the morning. I wanted to order Avocado Eggs Benedict but was told that it was no longer in the menu. In the end I had to settle for mushroom toast and the taste was mediocre. The latte didn't taste like latte at all as it was too strong and bitter. The colour was dark and there was little milk in it. Overall, I think the cafe has been overrated
4
Went to Lola's after a long time. Disappointed that there was no more french toast on the menu! :( Nonetheless the food didn't disappoint me! Love their chicken wings! The Truffle Mushroom Pasta was great! The slow braised pork with truffle potato puree was so well done! Will definitely be back for more :)
3
We had our table exactly at the reserved time. Ordered chicken aglio olio but it tasted like pesto sauce instead without the spicy nor garlicky kick to it. Latte wasn't well done as it tasted like the it was overly extracted. Only only satisfying dish was the chicken wings.
4
nice place to chill and hang out with friends or dates. the mains were really nice but the lychee cake wasnt up to expectation, taste dry.
4
Overall, pleasant dining experience.food was pretty ok despite cafe was crowded. Service level was a little slow due to the crowd.
5
Lola serves up worthy food for the prices paid. the honey wings are really really awesome. casual ambience!
4
Service was very good! Music was a bit loud though so everyone was speaking very loudly.
The food was not as good as I expected; it was average. But I came for dinner so perhaps brunch would be better. Prices were quite decent though.
5
Everything is good in the cafe, good service and food was really yummy and tasty. Have been to Lola's cafe for many times.
4
I went to Lola's cafe several times with my girlfriends for a weekend brunch. Love the food and the ambience too. It's price are quite reasonable for cafe level and I love their truffle fries!
4
Reasonable price with huge portion. Advanced reservation is needed as the cafe is always packed with customers.
4
the signature is the honey paprika wings. fries are pretty good too. coffee is great. be prepared to queue during popular timings even though they have expanded.
5
I booked a table for 6 and we arrived a alittle later than the stipulated time (really sorry about it!) However the staff still welcome us a wide smile and also took the initiative to provide two back support chairs with pillows for my two pregnant friends! Thank you for the great service! As for the food, the fish and chips were little dry but the wings and truffles fries were great.
5
Every time i come here, it feels like it is my first time as they impress me with their food and service. The staff are always on the ball and on the look out to serve your every need so that you can fully enjoy your meal and experience at the cafe. Price-wise is still ok
3
Food served was fast. But the taste was average and did not have much impression on the food served.
4
Those the selection of food is not too much, but every dish in the menu is good 👍
The service fm the staff are great too!
5
Thank you for holding our table been though we were a little late. Great place to chill and relax :)
4
A good place with good food but the seats are too close and can be a tab too noisy. The pasta was good with generous mushrooms and salmon.
3
We were really surprised when we saw the menu- really limited... some pieces in my fish and chips were almost burnt, but the truffle fries was amazing!
4
Food is always tasty there. Love the lola's chocolate cake. Crispy chicken wings are also our favorites there. Nacho Cheese fries was bit too soggy and salty for my liking. Appreciate the added menu items.
4
Good ambience and quaint litte cafe to spend your arfternoon. Always look forward to the desserts here!
4
Food was slightly salty, however, food portion is big. It has a good ambiance and customer service level.
5
I had the Ultimate Croissant which looked like nothing special but was in fact quite tasty. The eggs were nicely scrambled and the croissant fluffy but crispy. Despite rave reviews, the Honey Paprika Chicken Wings were slightly disappointing because the honey was drizzled over the wings and the paprika powder sprinkled unevenly on top of it; I felt that the combination was slightly odd. The batter was not that fragrant either. Iced latte was decent but not extraordinary. I also had the Chocolate Tart with Coffee Cream, and thought that the tart pastry could have been more fragrant (it also tasted a bit stale). Would have been nice if the tart had been warmed up slightly as well
3
I wrote few months ago a very good review celebrating the pulled pork burger, but this burger - so yummy, my favorite one - is no more on the list. I tried the other burgers (beef - chicken) but I thought none was up to my expectations. Dear team, can you give me the pulled pork burger back ???
4
Pro: luv e tables which are made of old sewing machines with functional footer. Sauce for e fish & chips is superb.
Con: a bit noisy as it is full on a Tue night.
4
A small but busy cafe with tasty food options. Wait time can be long during weekend lunch. The wings and fry were quite good! Their juices sounded very tasty on the menu but was disappointed they were bottled ones.
5
The only cafe that I keep revisiting! Generous portion of food which taste amazing as always! I ordered 2 starters and 1 main and shared with my friend and we couldn't even finish it!
5
Their brunch are one of the best yet cheap as it is nett price.
As nett price = no service charge and GST.
5
Cozy cafe that serves amazingly affordable good food! Their cheese fries is to die for, same goes for the pull pork sandwiches and the honey drumlets. It's always full house, so make sure you do reservations.
4
should really try the wings and the fries! would recommend to go during the brunch period and breakfast. love the ginger beer as well :)
4
The service is good and the food is tasty. I had the crab cake Benedict and creme Brulee and latte. The portions are good and value for the money.
3
The food is nice and the price is reasonable.
Avoid weekend and ph. No reservations can be made. The table seating can improve because quite squeezy. The table distance is about 15cm with another table. U can easily heard what other ppl talking.
5
This cafe has people cueing around the block at the weekend, and it's no mystery why.Try the Crab Benedict if you fancy an Asian twist on your weekend breakfast treat.Portions are very generous in all of the dishes too - well worth a visit
4
their wings is the best! i enjoyed their coffee too! love their fish & chips! taste good even when it's cold! hehehehethe crab & prawn pasta is delicious as well!the only thing i don't quite enjoy was the cakes - just not my cup of tea
3
The spicy swimmer crab pasta was delicious. However, the lychee rose cake was a disappointment as the base of the sponge cake was dry.
4
My family and I found the truffle pasta to be really delicious. The cakes were good too. Service at this cafe was rather decent. This place is worth a visit!
4
Main course no much choice,but staff very friendly ,environment not bad .drink also no much choice.overall ok only
4
Good food and service! Flexible with reservation timing. Will definitely head back to try other stuff on the menu again.
4
Nice presentation of food. Service is prompt and waiters/waitresses are friendly. Their toast is crispy and good.
4
Tried their new food items and they were not bad! The crab cake benedict did not really appeal to me but the grilled chicken sandwich did! I also personally prefer the previous presentation of the croissant.
4
One staff comes to inform me that the sofa seat is available. So I follow her out the shop 2 only to find out that the seat has been given out by her colleague. I would suggest the staffs to communicate before they tell their customers.
4
Came here for our Good Friday lunch, indeed it is making sure that Good Friday is very good indeed! Here is what we think:Ambience: 4/5Cleanliness: 5/5Customer Service: 5/5Quality of Food: 4.5/5Value for Money: 4/5Our Orders:Honey Glazed Chicken Wings: 5/5Bangers & Mash: 4.5/5Honey Apple Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream: 4.5/5The Good: We love this place, totally love this place. The dishes we ordered are very well thought through, we like how the dishes are balanced in flavour, the cakes are just sweet enough to be matched with the ice cream, the honey glazed chicken wings are crispy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside, magnificent! The Bad: We thought it's a bit too crowded, but it's a holiday, so it's good!The Bottom Line: It made itself into our secret Top Ten List, definitely coming back here again
4
It was one of those times where I'm due for a coffee break, but was not at an ideal location. That's when I stumbled upon Lola's cafe and decided to give it a try. Coffee was mildly acidic but still acceptable and service was welcoming. Looks like it is managed by youngsters with a pleasant attitude. Kudos! The orange almond cake would have been better if it was softer. Overall, the place is a pleasant ambience
5
Absolutely love the food here. I've been back on multiple occasions already and it never fails to impress. I had their breakfast croissant [$14] which was ham, bacon and their creamy scrambled eggs rested upon a honey croissant. Definitely a great start to a day and super filling too! Their sausage stew [$16] was pretty good in flavour too but wasn't as filling as their croissant. Do remember to try their honey paprika wings [$10 for 8] because it's really the BEST that i've had. Note that their breakfast menu only lasts from 10am to 3pm. They've a separate dinner menu from 6-10pm. They still serve appetisers and deserts in between so don't worry! FYI, they've no GST and service charge so do leave a tip if you want to :
5
first time dining at lola and it was good. value for money. however, the place where we were sitting was a bit hot, maybe because it's just next to the door.
4
Love the ultimate crossiant! Ambience was cosy. Recommend that reservations be made as there are limited tables and seats.
5
Everything was great! Food was good and service staff were very polite and responsive. Do make reservations if possible to avoid the long queues.
4
Food is good and came in huge portions. But was quite sad that there's no more duck leg and mash potato in the menu:(
4
Visited Lola's for our coffee fix. Staffs were as usual friendly and thoughtful. We were there with a couple friend with infant and staffsHad arranged a corner seating for us. Going back for another chill out afternoon soon. :)
4
Love their breakfast butter croissant and their eggs atlantic!!!
Ingredients all went very well together! Great food great staff great ambience :)
5
This cafe is located nearby kovan MRT station, easy to find location and many seating. My girlfriend has commended that during weekdays you will need to queue up. We have ordered the chicken wings, the braised pork with truffle mash potato and the Lola cake as our dessert. The serving of the food is super fast even though there are many people, out of my expectation and good for hungry people like me. The chicken is crispy and coated with honey, inside is juicy. The braised pork is a fusion of Chinese and Western, pork do not have the fat skin attached with it and merge well with the mash potato. Dessert wise is good, it is a dark chocolate cake, it came in a big portion but it is a bit too creamy and sweet for me. Nevertheless the food there stand out especially the chicken wings, highly recommended to try, the restaurant do not charge 10% service charge and GST as well
4
Place gets crowded fast, so do make a booking prior to arrival. Desserts are good and affordable! Drinks wise could be better :) I ordered the strawberry fruit tea thinking that it was iced tea with strawberry slices but it was actually tea out of a tea bag + ice cubes.
5
Nice place, always packed with local people in their 25's. They have an excellent pulled pork burger. They have a good choice of beers, too. Selection of yummy desserts. Prices are OK for the place. Friendly staff and nice music : I love this place 
3
Made a booking stating birthday celebration for hubby but no special arrangement of private seats given. Place is small n squeezy thus I don't enjoy eating there. Drinks are small sized. Food are relatively good but choices are limited. Anyway it also seems like making a booking is no difference as they wont allocate a table just for you
4
Save for the difficulty in getting seats , everything else is almost perfect. Value for money comfort food.
5
The staff are very warm and welcoming, always there to help. The food are worth it with the price and is yummy!!
4
I really enjoyed the food as it came out hot and it was delicious! Service was good too as the servers were very friendly.
4
Everything were excellent, the FoOd.. The Service.. However music seemed rather too loud, bring it down a bit might be good.
4
Pretty impressed by Chope ease of reservation online n good follow up through email n phone call reminder
4
Food was great. We tried all the dishes on brunch menu. Personal fav is the truffle mushroom on toast!
5
Lola's and On The Table Cafe are my favourite cafes by far. Both cafes serve quality food (especially their egg benedict, pulled pork sandwich and honey paprika crispy wings! Check out my Instagram @madaboutmacha for more information!
5
I've been here several times, enough times to try everything on the menu and Lola's is easily the best Cafe in Singapore. All the food is tasty and excellent value for $. This Cafe is very busy but still maintains good service (very rare in Singapore)! I'll happily visit again :
4
Having been here once a couple of years back, I was hoping the food standard would be as I remembered it.Happy to say that the taste is as I remembered it to be! :) Service was also excellent and kudos to the team. However, one feedback that I'd give is that the tables are really on the small side and the gaps between the "planks" do create some inconvenience with smaller base cups (i.e. accidental tipping over
4
Made a reservation at 1230hrs on a Sunday but was 15mins late. Thankfully, they uphold to their 15mins grace period even though there was a long queue. Ordered breakfast butter croissant and truffle mushroom toast and was served pretty fast. Quality of the food was great and it's tax and service charge free. Definitely recommended to those brunch lovers out there.
5
Staff was very understanding, I was late for my 5.30pm reservation and they quickly changed it to 5.45pm
Food was still hot from the kitchen to the serving table :)
4
increase in variety and food was great..highly recommended if you like to try something new near the heartland
5
It was my first time been to this cafe. Nice ambience, friendly staff & of course, great food they have here! I like Breakfast butter croissant, it's my fav among all! :) will definitely visit this cafe again!
5
Tried the pull pork sandwich and mushroom toast on their brunch menu. All good. Place was pretty busy on a Monday during lunch time.
4
Liked the food and service. The atmosphere was nice too though tables were rather small. But cost of the food was abit on the high side.
5
Ordered several items to share. Portion is good. The honey wings and the pull pork sangers are my fave.
5
Enjoyed all the items we ordered. All yummy! Only wish they open earlier in the morning for breakfast (they open at 10am)
5
Great food and lovely service! Enjoy ourselves at Lola's each time we are here =) will be back again although the distance is far for us.

We ordered the crispy chicken burger and duck confit. The chicken burger is crispy (lives up to its name) yet juicy and tender. It is served with cooked cabbage instead of the usual raw cabbage. The buns are also lightly toasted that adds fragrance to the burger. I would recommend this dish. The duck confit is too dry and the meat is tough. It would have been better if the meat was cooked tender and is drizzled with sauce. It was served with mustard honey but I think that goes well with the salad but not the duck. The mashed potatoes on the side has a nice buttery taste and has little chunks of potatoes which I like. Service is pretty prompt and price is reasonable (mains within the $10+ range). I probably wouldn't return as the menu variety is limited. Maybe I'll return just to try the desserts. I've always wanted to try the food here as there's always a long queue on weekends. Honestly, I don't understand what's the hype about this cafe now.

First visit for brunch/lunch. Pleasantly surprise to wait for a table due to the lunch crowd on a Thurs afternoon. Tried their egg benedict, bangers & mash, as well as butter croissant. Very tasty & good portion. Coffee is nice & served in a cute yellow cup. Unfortunately, we are too full to try the salted caramel tart. Will go again to taste the sweets! Another thing is I must commend the great service of the staff as they change the order for me without a word, after I realise my hubby ordered the wrong dish for me. And that was after they serve me the wrongly ordered dish. Such good attitude is commendable!
5
The food and service at Lola's cafe was good! Food was really awesome and service was fast :) will go back again.
4
Love their breakfast butter croissant and their bangers and mash! Staff super friendly and great ambience as well~ Will visit again soon :)
5
This is 2nd time going already. Food was Nice especially the wings. Price is Affordable. Will definitely visit again.
5
The staff are friendly and responsive. Food is good and affordable. The place is kinda pack (this shows how popular they are). It's worth to visit!
4
Great food and coffee. Staffs are very friendly and good, but they need to be more careful when clearing plates as they accidentally splashed some stuff on my friend's dress.
5
Food was good. and good portioning however space between tables were abit cramped and claustrophobic.Good service & best to make reservations or you have 90% high chance to be in waiting queue.Near to MRT & main Road. Parking limited. Pricey Food but yummy. Must try Chicken Drumlets/wings !Close on Monday
5
Reserved a table of 6 for an early Christmas celebration. It's our 3rd time there and the service and food remained consistent. Staff were attentive and food was delicious as usual. Only comment was that the truffled mushroom toast didn't really have a truffle taste to it. :)
4
This "secret" hideout along Simon Road have the best chicken wing. The complex taste of sweet and spicy will be shouting for acknowledgment the moment you take a bite of it. Overall the food selection are limited but the standard is good. The service standard is very standard, they can do better if they can create that homely cafe feel if they up their effort in putting some "personal touch".
3
Had dinner with two others. Spaghetti with cream sauce was tasty. Chicken wings not as juicy as I had expected. There was too much flour in the batter and the sauce could have a bit more bite to it. Chicken salad was satisfactory. Leaves were fresh but the chicken pieces could have been more moist. The juices we ordered were pretty refreshing. We did find the seats a tad uncomfortably narrow for our above average sized bodies. Prices could be lower for the food we were served and the ambience and seating of the restaurant. Overall, a satisfactory experience
5
Mouth-watering menu, service was quick, food is served on time, staff was very helpful and the ambiance is conducive for chit-chat. These are some of the things that went right on our visit. I went there with my mother-in-law, sister-in-law, wife, and 6 month old kid on a gloomy-about-to-rain Wednesday lunch schedule. The location of the cafe is very accessible since it's just a less-than-5 minute walk from Kovan MRT.We ordered mashed potato for our kid, and for ourselves, nacho cheese fries and honey paprika chicken wings for our appetizer, truffle mushroom toast, smoked pulled pork sanger, breakfast butter croissant and lola's full works for our main course and chocolate seasalt tart for our dessert. Everything looks yummy in our eyes, and everything is "instragrammable". Perfect for my wife and her sister since they like to take pictures :P. Little downside is they don't serve rice for lunch.As for the price, including our drinks of iced latte, iced cappucino and iced strawberry, we spent a little over 100 SGD. Definitely worth it and will be back once my family visits again.Special shoutout to the staff from Sengkang :) So proactive and always ready to serve, definitely started our day right with this choice of place to eat :
4
Brunch was good as ever. Comfort food at a nice and cosy cafe. Slightly pricey though. Otherwise, all good(:
5
I come here occasionally and all my visits have been excellent. I enjoy the food, good coffee, and the service is always excellent.
4
A pretty nice place to hang out with friends. Coffee, tea and the usual finger food. I highly recommend the fried chicken wings and truffle fries. Bangers and mash was lovely too.
5
Absolutely love their breakfast butter croissant. It's my 7th time here and I still order the same thing 😄 Tried their bangers and mash too and it's delicious as well. Worth a visit!!!
5
Great food and service! Staff were really friendly and it's my second time there already. Food was really good too and value for money.
5
My family and I enjoy eating here. We love the chicken salad, nacho cheese fries, the chicken sandwich and the chicken wings. Everything else on the menu is tasty but the honey glazed wings are hands-down the best in the area.
4
My daughter introduced me to the Avacado Eggs Benedict - she swears by it and after trying Eggs all over S'pore, she still claims Lola's the best and value for money.I started coming here for occassions, & coffee although I would like to drop by more often as I like the atmosphere, coffee & dessert as they are all delish so far but my fear is not getting a seat so i usually save my visits for brunch occassions. We had my daughters 21st birthday party there and my guests have now started to patronize the cafe too. Yesterday my friend and I who celebrate the same birthdate (Nov5th) met at Lola's for our annual birthdate meeting albeit it was belated. I ask for recommemdations other thsn my usual & the waiters & waitresses were helpful & honest and accommodating. So far haven't had any dissapointing dishes. and aside from the MUST TRY Avacado Eggs Benedict, The egg croissant (which u can request for all egg whites too) & the coffees ...the Lemon Tart is divine... so best go more than once because you just got to try everything on the menu:)
4
A great first visit during brunch hours - food, beverages, value for $, service made excellent impression. Visit was on a weekday with a friend who recommended the place, we were able to hang out for the entire afternoon even though the seats were the most cushioned! LOL. Did not have room to stomach dessert as we had 2 mains (avocado egg benedict / mushroom truffle toast) and 2 starters (honey paprika wings / truffle fries) along with a beverage each. Would definitely revisit - perhaps to try the dinner menu; a pity they do not offer the dinner mains for lunch
4
The place is about 5-10 minutes walk from Kovan MRT. Staff was courteous and food was decent. Had their croissant with eggs and ham, pulled pork sandwich and truffle fries. Food was decent and have no complains about it. The cafe is a bit too noisy but still tolerable
4
Food was good overall though the chocolate cake we ordered was a bit of a disappointment. Cafe was too uptight over their seats. There were a lot of empty tables when we were there n the staff there insisted that we have to wait outdoor for our takeaways
3
I had the bangers and mash, which was reasonably priced and it was well seasoned and of a substantial portion. seating space was rather cramp too.
5
Celebrated a friend's birthday there. Food was pretty good, price is reasonable. Service from staff is good, although was pretty difficult to dine at the high table in skirts, maybe I'll make a special request in the future. Overall pleasant experience.
3
Food was served promptly and wait staff was friendly and helpful. Food and dessert is above average and reasonably priced.
5
Suitable for friends and family to hang out. The food is tasty and the service is good. However there is no meal during 3pm to 6pm
4
Overall I had a good experience, was there to celeberate my friend's birthday..Staffs were very friendly and helpful!Would love to patronise again!
5
It was our second time here and still, the food they serve are very delicious. Well recommended is their chicken wings. They different menu for breakfast and dinner yet they have some all day food as well. Their beers are not the usual ones but worth the try. Desserts are yummy as well specially the lemon meringue tart. Now that they have a bigget space, there is lesser time to wait to sit. Before the queue is really long. We would definitely be back next time for brunch
4
Firstly, I would really like to commend the staff for their excellent service standards (: when I made the reservation, I selected the wrong number of people and if I edited my choice, the reservation timing had to be changed. So I called up the restaurant and they immediately changed my reservation pax with no issues, and were very kind about it as well. Througout the dinner, the staff were very kind and attentive, quick to respond to us and patient through it all (: The reason for 4 stars is due to the food, which was good but considered quite normal. The dessert portions were really small! However, it was an overall pleasant experience and we would definitely come back again (:
5
I was on a late dinner hunt one night past 10pm, when I chanced upon Lola's by Simon Road. What a discovery !I took 2 items on the menu - honey chicken wings and Lola's signature chocolate cake. The chicken was superb with its crunchy, sweet outer layer, matched with the soft and tasty chicken meat. Main spice ingredient is paprika and this is paired with sweet honey sauce. Dessert of chocolate cake was a good ending to this light meal. A good balancer was hot strawberry tea.There are many other items in the menu which seem worth a revisit. Will definitely return to Lola's.
5
Went with my teenage children for dinner at this quaint cafe conveniently located with 5 mins walking distance from Kovan mrt station. Expected a crowd on a weekend and was pleasantly surprised we were number 6 in queue.Prices were reasonable with no Gst & service charge.Nacho cheese fries was ok, honey paprika crispy wings were addictive. Spicy crab pasta was extremely delectable, I had my all time favourite duck leg confit, not disappointed. My son had pork goulash served with pilaf and done nachos. His plate was totally cleaned up, so much we can say how delicious it must have been.French toast was to die for and we shared it with coffee and a slice of lychee rose water cake (cake was a bit to hard though, otherwise taste was pleasantly unusual).Will definitely be back to try the breakfast soon
4
I have always wanted to visit this cafe but since it is out of my usual work-house route, I would usually forego of the idea. Finally, I was able to try when I visit a friend who lives nearby. The place is actually very accessible because it is just a short walk from Kovan MRT.This cafe is well known for the Honey Chicken Wings and the desserts. But we did try other stuff on their dinner menu as well. We ordered the Duck confit, Mushroom and Bacon Carbonara, Truffle Fries, Honey Chicken Wings, Iced Organic Chai for drinks, and Tiramisu for dessert.I like the Duck confit. well cooked, Crispy exterior, soft and moist in the inside. There's generous portion of mashed potato and green salad on the side. Salad is average, mashed potato is okay but i find it not soft and smoothly mashed enough. The Mushroom and Bacon Carbonara is suppose to have a truffle taste into it. While there is a slight hint of earthiness in the flavors, you may actually missed it if your tastebuds are not very familiar with the truffle taste. This was a let-down for me as I feel that I was deceived, or maybe, my expectations are too high. Same goes for the Truffle Fries. You can barely taste the truffle flavors in it. They are generous with the parmesan though, and they give generous portions so I will let it pass. I still find it okay and way better than most cafe's that serves truffle fries. The Honey Chicken Wings is total comfort food. Worthy of the praises, nothing more I can say. We didn't expect having cardamom and cloves on our Iced Organic Chai. It is not that bad, but an acquired taste, I'd say. It's refreshing just as well, but the serving is too small. The Tiramisu isn't bad, but I don't think something to rave about as well. Just your usual tiramisu.While we enjoyed the dinner in general, yes, there are hits but there are also some misses. Since we came before dinner time, about 6:30pm, we were able to get a seat right away because there's just two of us. The staff are very nice to seat us on a four seater table agreeing with them that we are okay to share the table with anyone who comes by two's. But after ordering, we have almost occupied the full table just for ourselves, so I think the staff can't do anything more. They keep on looking at us though, as the cafe started filling up by around 7:30pm onwards and groups started queueing for tables that could acomodate them. I just find the two seater table too small, it would've been fine if we're just having drinks.Value for money, I'd say yes, it is. Cafe's nowadays doesn't really come cheap, but their prices here are reasonable and lower than other hip cafe's. The decor, lighting, music and overall ambience are quite nice too. The crowd can just be a bit loud at times since the place can acomodate so many people.Would I visit again? I think I won't mind. So, Yes
5
The staff were friendly and the service was great. Ordered the truffle fries and the breakfast croissant, the portion was generous and they were well-cooked.
5
Their brunch avocado with eggs Benedict is a must try! Awesome taste And affordable prices. My friends and I really love the service and atmosphere
5
The food is not bad and there is no gst and service charge. Waiting time for the food is reasonably short and the service is really good.
5
Amazing food at a reasonable price, the wings are a must try! There was a line even on a weekday afternoon but a reservation through Chope allowed us to get a table and be served immediately. :-)
5
Food was yummy, service was great and it's definitely worth going again :) ! Cakes was unique n special.
4
Easy to find the way to the restaurant... The food is nice.. I like their cheese fries and Lola chocolate cake..
5
The food was good and with excellent services. Waiter offered to change a chair with backing and gave me a pillow seeing that I was pregnant. Will visit again.
5
Food portions are huge and value for money & delicious. Service was impeccable too as usual. The perfect place within the heartlands.
4
Brought my Friend to visit this cafe since I heard quite a number of good review for this cafe.
The service was good, the atmosphere was nice and food was delicious 👍🏻
3
A nice cafe tucked away at a corner of kovan.. Ordered a rose lychee cake, truffle fries and an odd fellow..Wasn't impressed..Cake was moist compact and looked undercooked. Lychee flavor was good but overwhelmed by butter taste.. Truffle fries.. Could do betterOdd fellow.. strong cinnamon taste but toned down by vanilla ice cream.. Wasn't too bad..Peeked at main course eaten by next door patrons.. didnt look inviting.. I guess could improve on presentation. .I would revisit but not if I have to queue.
5
All the staff were beaming with bright smiles and were attentive to the needs of each customers. They would notice when your drinking cup is empty and refill it for you without prompting. All of them were also polite and very friendly! Thumbs up.
4
No service charge or GST applied. Very friendly staff, good food and good dinning environment. Reservation is advised during dinner time and weekends to avoid long waiting time
5
Service was very good, waitresses were always looking out for their customers. Food tasted great 👍🏼
3
Butter croissant and toast bread was slightly burnt. Chicken was not very fresh but the seasoning was good. Desserts were not up to expectations as well.
5
Cafe staff were very smiley and approachable. They even specially prepared a chair with backrest and cushion for my pregnant wife for waiting and dining.
Wait time for food was short and food was beyond expectations. We especially liked the honey crispy chicken wings!
5
Great staff, wonderful service, food is good as usual . The wings were awesome as usual, the Bangers and Mash likewise.
3
The portion was large and the food was above average. Nothing much to comment about.
Service was good and prompt. But need to queue. Atmosphere was cosy and comfy. Good place to meet friends.
3
We heard about Lola's cafe for a while, but we were always deterred from going because of the crowd.One year ago we went around 12 noon on week end and we were told by the staff that we can not queue as they were already full for the day... This time we went on Tuesday ( monday is closed), we made a reservation at 7 pm. It was a good idea as people without reservation were queuing outside already. My wife ordered the pasta (14-15 SGD I think) and me the pork burger served with fries(around same price). The Pasta were very tasty, but quantity quite small. Specially it is a served in one big plate which intensify the impression the portion is small.Burger is quite small too but actually quite dense, mine was with the pulled pork and red cabbage and cheese (sliced cheese you can find in any supermarket). quite tasty. Surprisingly the bun was quite soggy. I was not used to it but with the cabbage-pork mixed, it gave it quite a nice texture and it change for typical burger you can be served everywhere. The fries are not the typical thin and small ones, thicker and longer but quantity a bit short, all together it make the size of one large potatoe.We also ordered crispy wing, 10 SGD, nothing special.We ordered see salt chocolate tarte. 5 SGD, Size is proportional to the price. It is small to share but I must admitted it is rare in Singapore to find good pastry desert for that price.Table next to us ordered the duck confit. It looks a bit small too.May be will come back for a brunch.Service is good, they actually have quite some resources to handle the customers.Might be different during Week End!
5
The brunch and dinner at Lola's Cafe are both delicious and are worth the price. The staff were all very friendly and approachable. Perfect for get togethers with friends and family or just a casual date with your loved one :) Do make a reservation beforehand as it tends to be crowded
3
Was there on a Friday late morning. We were told to expect 20 to 25 minutes waiting time. There was a choice for outdoor seats i.e. walkway along the row of shop houses. Uncomfortable looking table and chairs. We didn't favor outdoor seats because it was near noon (too humid) and there was road construction about 100 meters away and the deafening noise and dust from roadworks would never be a choice. They had another unit next door but did not open to the waiting crowd. I couldn't order a fish burger, they only served breakfast before noon. Croissant packed with scrambled egg and ham and bacon was a wrong choice I made. Wet and mushy eggs and ham and bacon combination was too salty for my palate. I'd like to visit again to try their lunch menu. Breakfast doesn't work for me
5
To date, Lola's cafe remains one of my favourite cafe around. Great food, very decent portions and great value for money. Service is good too.
5
We had the cheese fries and the chicken wings, they were awesome. The atmosphere is nice, would come back again for sure
5
Always loved their chicken wings. It's a must every visit!!! Had the butter croissant and it was rly nice and filling too.
5
The service was good. All of the servers were very attentive and helpful. Food was served shortly after ordering and water was given without us having to ask. The food and ambiance made us decide to visit again.
4
Enjoyed the swimmer crab pasta, duck confit and lemon meringue. Reservations strongly recommended!!!
4
We wanted a late dinner and made reservations. We were shown to a table at the entrance. The Aircon was on full blast and that kept everyone cool and comfy because the cafe was filled to the max. If you don't have a reservation you'll have to wait. We ordered the truffle fries, bangers and mash, swimmer crab spaghetti and a burger. All were satisfactory :)
4
The food is good, and we enjoyed ourselves. we only didn't like it that there was a $12/pax condition to chope the seat and hence instead choping for for 4 people and a child, we hoped for only four people. anyway, four of us ended up eating more than what covered the cost of the child
4
Service was good and smiley. I had a chicken salad and my partner had the salmon benedict. Both were very tasty. I should have asked for the salad dressing on the side as it was a tad too sweet for me. We tried the salted caramel popcorn cake. The taste was good. However, the cake batter was slightly over-mixed, thus was not fluffy and light. It was dense with some gooey parts. The frosting and caramel was good, though. It was not the best but still acceptable on the whole. One dish we loved was the nacho cheese fries. Definitely hit the spot. We went on a weekday early afternoon so there wasn't a long queue. This cafe is just a 5-mins walk from Kovan station
3
food was good. cant be said of the service cos we went just a few mins shy of the opening, but staff insisted we had to stand outside the door to wait for the official opening time, some of us had young kids w us so it would hv been helpful if we could just seat inside to wait.placed orders for truffle mushroom sandwich but truffle fries was served instead. my original order was served to the next table who just placed orders for the same thing and we had to wait 20 mins instead for the same order.
4
Popped in today for a snack. We had the wings followed by the apple pie and ice cream. Service was good as was the food and speed of deliver. Along with two coffees the bill was $27. So quite reasonably priced. As it was Sunday the place was very busy albeit we were there mid afternoon. It was quite noisy due the 'hard' surfaces, but tolerable. Will return.
4
The service staff were very polite and the food was excellent. It is always crowded during dinner time so definitely recommend to chope seats before going.
3
The price is very affordable comparing with other cafes.. However, the food was not as good as before.
4
Good brunch & coffee!! New seating place are more spacious & comfy.
Nice place to hang out with friends. But the queue outside may make u shy to stay longer :)
3
Limited parking lots. We ordered the much talked about truffle mushroom toast but were disappointed. Overall the food tasted average.
5
Totally loved it! Food was good, reasonable price and the staffs were excellent! Definitely will be back
5
The staffs are very friendly, they take a lot of initiative to refill our water and were cool even when we took quite some time to decide what we want to have for deserts.
5
Cannot find anything bad about my dinner at LOLA's Cafe. Everything were ExceLLent!!! From the food to the staffs... Will definitely go again, maybe to try their breakfast menu next.
5
I loved to be in Lola's Cafe, coz the food is very delicious and well I love fried things, so the fried fries there is the BEST. Think about it making me drooling again.. Would absolutely going again sometime over the weekends..
3
Six of us had Sunday brunch here. They do not take reservations, but you can get there earlier to get a queue number, though you would still have to wait for a table when the entire party arrives. It can get crowded, especially during the weekends.Service was quick and the young staff were pretty fast and efficient to get your orders, as well as to serve table water etc.Foodwise, there were some hits and misses. The truffle fries were very good, and tasted even better with the small tub of nacho cheese we ordered. The pulled pork sandwich was not bad, though it was a tad 'wet', perhaps due to the buttered bread. The portions were quite generous and we took half a sandwich home. In fact, it tasted better after dry frying for a couple of minutes.The croissant with avocado was also very tasty. However, two of us ordered the full plate, which was not as good. The sausage, ham and bacon were a tad on the oily side, and the brioche read would have been better toasted alone, without butter.Overall, it's a nice place to chill out over breakfast but staff are keen for you to move on, to free up the table for other guests. They do serve tap water here, both hot and cold, without surcharge
4
the honey paprika wings are the best. the croissant brunch was really satisfying being a fan of puff pasty. however the supposedly recommended big breakfast, it paled in comparison. the only diff was the bratwurst (which is usually quite cheap, it's just processed meat anyway) hence insignificant. the mocha was awesome, coffee lovers go ahead & try this 40% blue java. the avg rating due to easy prep for the food, nothing should go wrong
5
Good customer service, keep it up. I was super shock when you Approach me and knowing my name while i was waiting outside the cafe for my friend.
5
The food was good and it was good that the restaurant allowed us to chill after our meal at another very cozy corner. :)
4
Good foods. Good coffee. But a bit noisy due to big crowd. A bit stress as we seems need to finish our foods ASAP as many ppl Queing for seat.
5
Great food and excellent service by young staff. If the younger millennials are not keen on the service industry, they shouldn't be afraid to try as the young staff at Lola exemplified great service.
4
The food was awesome and delicious. However, a tat disappointed with the Avocado Benedict as the Avocado is not sliced but just puree at the side.
4
Duck confit and lemon meringue is sooooo good!! must try! especially lemon meringue, is the best I had so far! Will definitely come back for it!
4
Servic staff was attentive. Sometimes a little bit too much so. I was asked 5 times whether they could clear my plate.
Overall a great place for catch-ups with friends.
5
Staff were super helpful and I love how they are all so approach-ably smiley. I was doing abit of observant of the cafe's operations and flow and i must say that you guys have an awesome team with you though i can see that the staff are relatively a young bunch.Food is really good and really nothing to complain but all good comments.It was really quick, food was HOT which is what I love, and taste on fleeek!Kudos to the culinary team & I'll be back for sure
5
We arrived at the cafe at around 10.45am and we were told to Q up. The staff was very friendly and explained nicely to us that we needed to key in our phone number so that they could contact us if seats were available. When the food was served, we were so impressed. The truffle toast was awesome, the chocolate tart was not too sweet yet it was delicious and the croissant was served with creamy scrambled egg.We had a very hearty brunch and we will definitely visit this cafe again
5
Did extensive research online for the best brunch place in Singapore that offered true value for money and I found Lola's Cafe as one of the cafes with a consistent positive review. It's not within the main SIngapore CBD, but it's well worth the effort making the trip to.We had to wait quite a while for seats, but the waitstaff were very warm and friendly that we did not mind the wait. As soon as we sat down, we were handed the menu and had quite a tough time deciding what to order as there were many delicious-looking options. We finally settled for the bangers and mash, breakfast butter croissant, and the sea salt chocolate tart. The Breakfast Butter Croissant was a hefty sandwich of honey bacon, pork ham, cheddar cheese, and Cajun mayo with balsamic side salad, while the Bangers and Mash are pork sausages on a bed of creamy mashed potatoes with sweet onion sauce. We ended our meal with the Sea Salt Chocolate Tart with Coffee Cream. You can't go wrong with dark chocolate ganache, Bailey's cream, espresso, and sea salt. Soooo good I had to tell the wait staff I'd fly back to Singapore for this.Everything that we ate was delightfully delicious and was so reasonably priced that I don't think it's forgivable to charge so much for brunch like the other Singaporean cafes do.The only downside (if it is at all) is that Lola's Cafe is quite small that it can get quick packed during a busy day. Understandable as the food tastes great, servings are generous, the waitstaff are friendly, and the interiors are fun and quirky. :) The cafe can get really noisy at times, but I'm pretty sure that with the food, service, pricing, and the company you're with, you'd hardly mind the mild ruckus. :)Will we go back to Lola's Cafe? Yes! For sure! :)NOTE: Actual visit was in November 2014, not April 2015 (as this was the oldest date I could choose in the dropdown options.
5
I reserved a seat and requested to be out with my friends to surprise them and the staff were very happy to help!!
5
Service was great despite the big crowd. Food was served within 10 minutes upon ordering. Excellent! I had the swimmers crab pasta. It was flavorful and delicious though I wished the crab meat were less shredded! The brownie in a jar dessert is awesome!
3
Overstaffed for a weekday and they weren't very attentive to patrons. Feels like they were more engrossed in chatting amongst themselves. Though when they do approach your table, they are generally friendly. Food was average.
4
The whole environment was pleasant, all the service crews were helpful and enthusiastic to serve me and my friend! Just that the Caramel Popcorn Cake which I had ordered for my friend's bday was a tad dry! Overall was very good!:)
4
Been wanting to visit this cafe for a long time! Brought my family and we enjoyed the food and deserts and they were really yummy and price reasonable! I love the booking system too! Thumbs up will be back soon! :-))
5
Good experience with the great food and ambience. Service was also top notch and even provided recom
4
I thought that, it being in a little corner away from the city, one would find some peace and quiet lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon!! Haha.. No such luck!! The food is nice, probably that explains the crowd! There were 4 of us. We waited about 15-20 mins which was not too bad, really. Except that it was really very noisy. Service was nice and friendly, filled with young people. Food that was exceptionally good that deserves a mention (this is according to my 15-year old daughter) is the chicken wings and the truffle fries. My salad wasn't too bad either. One of our orders was the original "full breakfast" (sorry can't remember the name!) and it had a piece of brioche at the bottom, but was kinda soaking up all the oil from the sausage and ham (not sure if that was the original intention!!) and so, not so nice. The pulled pork was slightly better than ok! Overall food is REALLY OK! We also took away some lemon meringue and chocolate cake - they were nice. Might come back if parking space permits!! Hahaha.
5
I've been to many cafes but most of them are unable to serve quality food and thus, I tend not to be a consistent follower of most cafes. But unlike Lola, Lola's brunches are excellent, chicken wings and desserts are very good. Great service too. But very crowded. They have online reservation service now so do remember to reserve early. I will definitely visit again soon.
5
My girlfriend and I made a reservation for 1330 hours, but arrived 15 minutes early. Before I even attempted to open the doors, one of the service staff took notice of us from inside and rushed to open the door for us with wide smiles and a warm welcome. The same was true for each and every waiter/waitress that was at work on that day.They recently expanded their space and took up the shophouse beside the original outlet and almost doubled the amount of staff they had. The staff are all ready and attentive,even though there were periods of downtime where they just chilled at the bar area, once I put up my hand, they took notice of me in no time at all. Food took about 15 minutes to arrive, and judging that it was fully packed, I have no complaints on the waiting time. At just $12, you get a ridiculously large portion of crispy and fluffy shoestring fries, scented with just enough truffle oil that was not overbearing, and seasoned lightly with a dusting of grated parmesan.The Pulled Pork Sanger (pulled-pork sandwich) is something that appeals to the gentlemen, substantial and filling, with just enough picked cabbage to cut through the rich barbecued pulled pork and buttery brioche bun.We also tried the Eggs Atlantic, which includes 2 poached eggs coated with rich hollandaise, plated on slices of smoked salmon and a fluffy brioche.Much recommended for the couples and friends who want a cozy place that is convenient, (10 min walk from Kovan MRT) and prepare to enjoy service that will make you come back again and again.Do remember to reserve seats

Lola’s Café is a rather popular café located in Kovan, conveniently located near the Kovan MRT Station (on the purple-coloured Northeast Line). From Kovan, take Exit B and keep walking straight down Upper Serangoon Road. You should see the café’s prominently emblazoned sign as you approach the junction of Upper Serangoon Road and Simon Road. The café used to be a lot smaller, but I recently heard from the staff that they expanded to occupy the neighbouring unit as well. In any case, do make use of the online reservation to book a table! The place was still packed even after the kitchen closed when I last visited.We ordered Nachos Cheese Fries (S$8) to start, followed by Pulled Pork Burger (S$16) and Duck Confit Leg with Honey Mustard Sauce (S$17). The food was generally ok; I thought the pulled pork was a tad too dry and stringy but the purple slaw really helped by adding a really nice crunchy texture. The duck leg was not too shabby, and I really liked the sauce, which complemented the meat and mash quite well. For desserts, we got the Lola’s Chocolate Cake (S$6.50), Lychee Rosewater Cake (S$7) and the Chocolate Nutella Tart (S$7). Having visited Lola’s sister café On The Table and tasted their heavenly waffles with ice cream, I was a little disappointed with Lola’s offerings, which didn’t really have that WOW factor.The one thing which stood out for me about Lola’s was their exceptional service. They might seem a little rambunctious at times, but they were incredibly adaptable and accommodating. They acceded to my request to change tables without hesitation, and even gave us an adjoining table when someone came to join us at the last minute. Best part was, we didn’t even have to ask. Exceptional service indeed

The staff was very patient and helpful despite us being late. Food was hot and yummy. Overall great service and food!

My fav is the honey wings and the ice mocha. Brunch was ok. Great place to hang out with frens and partner.
5
Wonderful service and attitude provided by all of Lola's staffs! Well done and keep it up! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
4
Duck confit was good. The service was alright. But the tables were too small. Would prefer to have a bigger table.
5
Overall was very good. Waiters are polite and attend to us immediately. The ambience is good. A bad point was one of the waiter took my order, but forgot key in the system. I realized it when other customers that came later than us were served first. Lucky we were not in rush so it's alright :) The food was awesome
5
Had brunch on a Thursday morning, service staff were wonderful, food was great and they allow dogs in their outdoor sitting area. Coffee was on point, had a nice morning at Lola's. They are quite busy though, so this is not a good place to go solo or catch up on work.
1
Ordered a salad and a coffee. Paid $10 for the salad which I felt the taste is average. Coffee has a bad after taste. Staff was trying to clear plates from customers who are still eating. It really make me wonder why the rush. Even some of the staff are playing within the cafe. I know the staff are young and the cafe has a casual atmosphere but do know customers are eating. It would really bad if they accidentally kick the table or chair. I won't visit the cafe again
5
the food is very delicious.the bacon that us served is quite unique compared to other places.the croissant that i ordered was toasted to perfection and the combination of ham,scrambled eggs and mayo made this dish taste delicious.there is also a dessert menu which has dishes that changed from time to time,so each visit would be different.there is also some backstory behind some dishes so eating there would also be learning about the stories in the cafe.the chicken wings were quite delicious,they served it with equal number of drum sicks and thighs.the tables are made out of old sowing tables which can be interacted with (may annoy customers).overall it is a great place to eat at all times of the day.it serves food which is quite special
5
I was amazed that the staff know my name when i mentioned that i made reservation on Chop. Great service, great food and great ambience. Highly recommended to visit at least once. Must try their Honey Paprika spices Chicken wings, it crisp outside and the meat is tender.Definitely will patronize again
4
Two of us ordered a main (Confit of Duck, $17), a side (Honey Crispy Wings, 8 pcs for $10) and a dessert (Seasalt Chocolate Tart). The duck was really tender and the portion is quite big. Couldn't finish it as we were quite jelat. The crispy wings were awesome. Perfect mix of crispiness, spice and sweetness. The tart's chocolate was really smooth. The tart's crust is rather brittle, so it'll get messy when you dig your fork into it. Overall, great service! Food is not cheap (i.e., no bang for buck). Do remember to make reservations online as waiting time will be long during peak period (after 6.45pm-ish)
4
Booking is very convenient , food taste is reasonable however find the price a bit in a high side for a heartland cafe.
3
Food was quite good but the waiting time was a bit long. However, the service and smiles of the waiters and waiteress made the trip better and made my day too.
4
Glad that i made this decision to dine at Lola's. Service was superb! Keep it up! Food was pleasant! Though might be slightly overrated in my opinion! But crab pasta is definitely a "must try"!
4
The food is good and the service is fast. You have to reserve a seat before you go as it is just so popular.
4
Great honey crispy wings, we all love the bacon & mushroom truffle cream pasta, taste was thick enough. Fisherman's dory burger is also great as well.
4
We ordered the Honey Paprika Crispy Wings, Avocado Eggs Benedict and Mushroom and Cheese Sandwich.The Honey Paprika Crispy Wings is a must try! The wings did leave a deep impression for us. Definitely coming back for more. As for the avocado eggs benedict and mushroom and cheese sandwich, they were tasty as well but not fantastic and nothing too special.The good thing about Lola's Cafe is that the price listed on the menu is nett price. No GST and service charge! But one thing to note is that they do not accept credit cards, payment only by NETS or cash.For more reviews, check out http://idylsherry.blogspot.sg/2014/06/cafes-i-tried-in-singapore.htm

At 2:40pm, I accidentally entered Lola's Cafe due to the nasty Indonesisn haze at PSI 155 & the heavy pour. The adjacent Public Car Park was under reconstruction so had to parallel-park in front of Cafe with a limited 10 lots only, luckily found one vacant. First impression was the i-Pad for taking Queue number at the entrance. Was about to press for my number when i was given a welcoming surprise by an enthusiastic & bubbly waitress named Carmile. She was warm, friendly & ushered me to my table. Indeed, the table was small which was meant for 2 but seriously, I dont think it could fit dishes for 2 pax. Being first time here, i asked what's popular or Lola's signature dish for brunch & Carmile was honest enough to say she would enquire from her fellow colleagues. As she vanished off, another pleasant waitress Vicki attended to me & suggested Lola's Full Monty Breakfast (SGD16.00). Didnt wait long, in less than 10 minutes it was served (ref pic) by a muscular looking Evan, & was courteous. Carmile returned & suggested a hot cuppa Mocha & she'll serve warm water too. Mocha came very late when my meal was almost 80% gone & warm water was forgotten, only towards the end. Food wise, the thick Bratwurst Sausage was good: bouncy, juicy & tasty. Scrambled Egg was kindof bland: cant taste the saltiness at all & no eggy fragrance. I was searching for black pepper but couldnt smell nor see them. The Garden Salad had 3 Lettuce but only one pathetic cherry tomato cut into half wt sour vinegrette. Could have thrown in 1 to 2 additional cherry tomatoes. Toast had a good yellowish tinge but didnt look nor tasted fresh & felt cold when touched. The Bacon looked soggy & oily & not crispy at all but I was told later that it's Honey Bacon. Furthermore, there was no seducing aroma oozing from the bacon which i would expect from most bacons i've cooked or eaten. Underneath the Bacon was the Ham, strangely both were cold. I was disappointed that other reviews said the meats were served fragrant but not mine. Hence, the only hot item on my plate was the sausage, everything else was cold. Now, i began to doubt & turning suspicious whether my food was cooked properly & would this lead me to diarrhoea after ingesting. Drinkwise: i was taken aback when the Mocha came, it was served in a small glass cup & it's SGD5. Generally in most cafes & restaurants, Mochas are served in cups larger than the normal kopitiam cups. (Starbucks would cost from SGD2.30 to SGD4 & served in a huge cup, maybe 2 & half times that of Lola's). I was puzzled why a supposedly hot mocha was cold when i sipped. Premise-wise: agree wt other TA reviewers that it's pretty congested & table-setting was too close to each other. I could even hear what secrets neighbouring customers were chatting from all 4 sides. Interior deco was quite cool & creative (ref pic). Price-wise: I was sharing with the charming waiter Evan that the charges is pretty similar to cafes are charging in Melbourne CBD but in Aussie $. I was very fortunate to have met another waitress Angela who kindly explained the different pastries in the cabinet & was impressed with her profound product knowledge. In the end, it was simply easy for her to 'closing a sale' with me buying back 2 of their top fast-moving fav desserts, Bailey's Coffee Cake & Lemon Meringue. The other staff worth mentioning was Maple whom I highly admired her competent leadership skills in managing both the staff & customers too, very well. Lastly, after buying my 2 desserts, i had rumblings & squeezing pains in my stomach & had to hurriedly rush home due to diarrhoea. My conclusion, the saving grace & positive point is the pleasant waiting staff & Miss Maple. I had some doubts on the hygiene & culinary skills of the kitchen team which gave me a nasty diarrhoea. How could hot dishes like Bacon & Ham & Scrambled Egg not exuding any fragrances at all? Something's seriously amiss. And how could a piping hot beverage like Mocha be served cold unless I requested for Iced-Mocha? Perhaps, management have to seriously looked into these vital matters. Pricing is on the high side, am not asking for hawker center or foodcourt price. Need revising the pricings. Need re-arranging Table-setting because its crampy & too close. Need to reconsider table size, makes diners look clumsy when using cutleries. Need to monitor working attitude of kitchen team. Could be a hint or symptoms of some disgruntled or mischievious kitchen staff in the fold. Overall, there's a good future & progress if management desires greater growth & expansion. Kudos to Miss Maple. Would I return? The phobia of having diarrhoea is haunting me but let's see what management can do to lure me back if they were serious in customer retention & customer loyalty.

Popular place with limited seating. We decided to give it a go to decide for ourselves. Apart from the wings, we had the dory burger, pasta and also the lychee cake. Pasta was decent, burger average, lychee cake poor(too dense and artifically sweet). Will not be going back again
2
Well, the service wasn't so good as the waitress and waiters keep eyeing on whether u had finish the food and wanted to clear it away asap ( sounds efficient but they are like kind of chasing u out of the restaurant asap) . Payment mode was either cash or nets which I think it's not so flexible . 
4
Decided to go over to this cafe to check the ambience, food, drink and service quality. I was greeted by the wait staff and I was warmly given a seat.I ordered the mocha and it really tasted yummy. The only issue is probably that the cup is a little to small for me to enjoy the great taste of my mocha
5
Great service! Awesome food!! What more can I say?
The truffle fries was good as well as their mild paprika honey wings!
Would definitely come back!
3
There wasn't even space to eat and crumbs would constantly drop on the floor.but Food was excellent.
1
Met with bad service crew and mediocre food at one of the most raved about cafe.
Had better food and experience elsewhere. In my opinion, I would save the time and head elsewhere for food and desserts.
2
Never had coffee as acidic as this. And too over-powering in taste too.
Although hummingbird cake was unique and very good, it's too expensive for that little slice.
Rental can't be too steep in that location.
4
The cafe serves very nice food but the space is a bit small and warm. Probably is time to expand. :D
2
super overrated cafe, average food, normal service, uncomfy environment....................,...,.........

Made a reservation and arrived 5 minutes late only to be notified they had given the table away. They had tried to call 15 minutes before the reservation but could not get through and gave the table away. What a bunch of crock. Waited 5 minutes on an outside table before a table opened up. Throughout the meal there were many service mess ups with food or drinks delivered which we did not order. The manager apologized at the end of the meal with their service and gave a 10% discount. Too little too late. The monty breakfast and egg croissant dish was OK. Mushroom cheese sandwich was terrible and tasted like the burger King mushroom Swiss burger but with a different bread. The chicken wings was horrid with some strange honey glaze.
3
The food is priced reasonably and tasted great.However, the croissant was messy to eat.Would love to see more variety on the brunch menu.The place was packed and the environment was generally very noisy - I could barely hear my friend speak! Table was really small too

was at Lola's on 28 June 2015 on a lazy Sunday afternoon with 2 others after their lunch hours and before their dinner hours, 2 other tables were taken besides ours. Only drinks, appetizers and desserts were available, so we went in for some tea time snacks. Not much of a alcohol list, we got the bailey affagato (great!), Iced Mocha (avarage) and Iced Chocolate (meh~ the local Iced milo at our local coffeeshops tastes better). The desserts came first: my honey panna cotta (not bad, tastes good but can be creamier: I have a sweet tooth) with crunchy walnut (not much walnut taste) crumbles, hummingbird cake (cant really taste the cheese). Then came our truffle fries (good when piping hot; kind of soft on the cheese shavings), and bangers and mash (home made mash, pretty decent.). We decided to go with another dessert: the little brownie jar (quite good if you really love earl grey, the taste was very evident in the ice cream) brownie was melty and delectable. We didnt have a chance to order mains so I cant comment on that. Desserts and appetizers are alright enough to garner a second visit, though I wont be craving anything anytime soon
4
Lola's cafe is all along our favourite cafe to go. We will always patronize at least once a month. Favourite food will be bacon and mushroom pasta, nacho cheese fries and crispy wings! After renovation the cafe seems to be more spacious and im glad that the tables were all changed!
5
Away from the hustle of the city and had a really cozy feel to it. Gets pretty crowded but there's an electronic queue system so you can leave your name there and explore the area for a while before they get you a seat

Finally, after three unsuccesful tries, I managed to have brunch at the ever-popular Lola's Cafe. With all the fuss and raves, I was very much looking forward, and in the process got the beautiful *Lara excited as well. A very small cafe with millimetres of table space apart and an array of desserts on display at the counter, it was crowded as usual. Thank god for reservations - I like their reservations system actually - complete with followup SMS text notification and an automated call reminder on the day itself.As for food, we began with their signature Honey Paprika Crispy Wings (SGD$10.00) - tasted yes, sweetness of the honeyed marination, but where was the crisp? Chicken was tender enough but there was no wow-factor at all.Then Lara's brunch set came - Lola's Full Monty Breakfast (SGD$15.00) - comprising of Brioche bread, pork sausage, honey bacon, pork ham, scrambled eggs, and garden salad with Balsamic dressing. It was served on a rather .....unpresentable plate and the verdict was an average at best. The bread was just your normal loafed bread, and the sausage was thick & limber in texture.I had the Avocado Eggs Benedict (SGD$15.00), served on the same kind of plate but with better arrangement, consisting of Brioche bread, avocado, poached eggs, pork ham, Hollandaise sauce and garden salad with Balsamic dressing. I could probably make this for half the price - but having thought that, this also means that this brunch set has a very wholesome, homely touch to it. The avocado was a little sad though - scrapes of avocado paste that contributed zilch to taste or texture.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/02/brunch-at-lolas-cafe.htm

It was a Thursday noon. Brought a friend from overseas for lunch in Lola's. Thought that we would get seats easily, since it's a week day and the shop is located housing estate. But we were wrong. When we arrived, there was a queue and we had to wait for about 20 mins to get a seat.We shared a Mushroom Melt and their famous Honey Paprika Crispy Wings.The mushroom melt was delicious, but I personally did not like the wings. To end off our meal, we decided to try their lemon meringue tart. It was very refreshing and good. Their coffee is reasonably acceptable. Overall, we enjoyed our meal
5
We really struggled to find a good restaurant in Singapore as reviews were unreliable, I had read about this place and we stumbled on it, so cute amidst colorful row houses on side street wandering off from Chinatown. It was too crowded for us to get a seat inside but they let us sit on the small cafe tables outside and it was perfect. We had great service and wonderful, creative food...small plates, good cocktails and fantastic desserts. Not cheap but well worth the price
3
Went on a Wednesday or Thursday, not expecting it to be crowded, but it was. If you're willing to share a table, it will be faster. Food was average, pacific dory burger ($15) was terrible, duck leg with honey mustard ($16) was cooked just nice. Honey paprika crispy wings($10) were nice, but was expecting a little more spice from the paprika, it was non existent. Service wasn't very good, but they were crowded that evening.If you're with a big group, best to call and make reservations. If not, it's the on arrival reservation system
4
We landed at Lola's cafe by accident, but it was a great accident! The queue was very long but they have a pretty cool on-arrival reservation system. You can 'check' yourself in, they send you an SMS with a token number, and call when your seats are ready - so all good. We wandered around the neighborhood and were actually called well before the 30-minute wait time we were told about. We had the Avocado Eggs Benedict and Breakfast Butter Croissant - both sans the meat, and the Lemonade-Thyme soda. The Eggs Benedict was light and creamy, the Croissant was nice and flaky and the eggs had just the right amount of kick with the Cajun spice & mayo. The lemonade had a distinctive taste because of the thyme and was super refreshing. Service is quick, food is really good, and the prices are competitive, not half as atrocious as many of the other brunch places
4
Whenever I passed by this place it always long queue. My girl wanted to go to this place for a long time but don't have the chance due to long wait. Weekday will be the best time to go and you can make reservation during weekday but must be one day in advance. no reservation during weekend.Foods were great for breakfast as we only tried that and especially the green tea matcha latte was special. Place was a bit small.
3
Cheese Fries Generous with their cheese, the fries were unexpectedly one of the better dish here. Almost finished it on my own. Mushroom and cheese toasties Hole in the middle of the brioche, stuff it with cheese and mushrooms. Stuff more cheese and bake it in the oven til toasted. I think even my sister know how to make it ?Wings Justifiable that their best dish is the one being that is being madly raved about. The wings - deep fried til golden brown, glazed with honey and a sprinkle of herbs. At S9 it is probably quite reasonable and worth the pocket. Breakfast Croissant Very average in my opinion. The croissant were not as fragrant and flaky as I remembered it to be. The eggs were in need of a tad of salt and pepper. The bacon which was once crisp turned out soggy. It's probably my taste picky taste buds, but i expected much more of this dish.for my full review and pics @ http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/11/lolas-cafe-simon-road.htm

Full Review and Pictures at: http://goingmerrily.blogspot.sg/2014/10/lolas-cafe-review-5-simon-road.html The cafe opens at 10am and when we reached at 10:05am, the waiting time is already 1 hour! No reservations during weekends - BE PREPARED TO WAIT. I highly recommend the Breakfast Butter Croissant! The egg was creamy and cheesy without being overwhelming while the croissant was freshly crisp and warm. Hands down 10/10

I happen to read reviews on Lola's cafe and decided to give it a try.I went with a few friends on Sunday before 6pm. Already there was a queue. We decided to cut our wait by agreeing to sit outside, thankfully it wasn't too humid that day. We ordered paprika wings and it's awesome. The skin was crispy and drizzled with either honey or some sweet sauce. Next was the duck leg with mustard sauce. It was good too, for its price. Somewhat like a duck confit on a bed of mashed potatoes with light tangy mustard sauce, topped with a bunch of arugula greens.Their lemon meringue tart was refreshing, the pastry wasn't too heavy. Spent about $20 per pax. To Drivers : There isn't too many parking around and mostly parallel parking.It's a great place to hang out. I would like to try their brunch some day. Hopefully they get to expand into their neighbors so that more can enjoy this little gem in Kovan

Go get a queue number when you are not hungry. The chix wings is nice but I would not wait 1.5 hours for food.
2
Waited for an hour for a sit but after tasted the food very disappointing. Nothing to praise about the food nor the service.
4
The only problem with this place is getting in. I go by often and the line is always out the door and down the block. But when I do manage to get it, the brunch is great and the beers offered are delicious.
4
Nice atmosphere and great food! Good place to chill out and have some finger food or desserts! Affordable price range! (:
4
Waited for more than half an hour on a weekend non-peak hour. Ordered low fat cuppucino, crispy wings and bacon pasta.No low fat milk, fine....after serving the coffee, no sugar provided, have to ask for itCrispy wings was excellent, everything just right, very fresh and crispy with the juice still piping hot inside. Again..staffs tend to forget to provide cuttery to customersPasta was very done as well as the truffle oil was rich enough.I will go back again and try different dishes

we went on a weekend for brunch. the brunch menu is quite simple yet packs quite a punch. the portion was just right and i feel the price was fair. besides brunch, there are also desserts, sides and other mains - they all sounded quite good. we tried the truffle fries - the helping is decent and although not the best truffle fries around, it was good enough.the drinks menu had quite the variety - coffees, teas, beers and other options such as juice and sodas. the coffee was a tad bit overpriced as the glass was generally quite small. i feel some normal tea options such as earl grey could have been on the menu; too many fancy things takes the shine out of the big picture.my main gripe was that they dont accept reservations on the weekends apparently and it was quite the wait for a table; however, we got a table in about 30-45mins which was half the time in which we were promised a table (1.5hrs we were informed) so that was probably decent estimation on the staff part or people just left really quickly.overall, quite a satisfying brunch experience and great value at about $25/pax for a main, drinks and shared side

The coffee, dinner and desserts at Lola's is good, especially at the price they are pitched at. The queues are always long and it's even hard to get an online reservation two weeks ahead of time. The staff are even tactful, but that's where I'm going to stop. I have no issue with long waits and no issues even with having to make a reservation a week or so in advance to secure a table at Lola's. What irks me most about my recent visits to Lola's was how the staff can try to be tactful whilst handling you with their smiles and diplomatically correct words - but at the same time make you feel like they don't want you to be there. My first bad experience (which was not my first visit to Lola's) was when I wanted to pick up my favourite lemon meringue tart to celebrate my birthday with my girlfriend. We just wanted to get a couple of cakes and get out to have the desserts at home but while we were at the counter looking into the freezer we were rudely interrupted by staff passing through who shot us unfriendly looks because we were in their way of clearing soiled dishes (soiled dishes have priority over customers who are shopping for desserts?). This happened a few times and the staff who was aware we were there to get take-outs also gestured for us to move aside. But there was no way we could have looked at the cakes without having to bend down? Second incident was today, we arrived on time at 730pm with an online reservation and after enquiring about our reservation inside, we were politely but promptly motioned to wait outside when there was ample standing room inside the cafe and a table was already being prepared for us. The table was promptly made available and the staff was on her way to get us when she was interrupted by another customer while she was on her way out. Instead of motioning for us to move inside to our table, we were made to wait another 10 minutes before we were acknowledge and brought to our table, which was empty and ready for the last 15 minutes. Long story short, Lola's has a great thing going for them, great product, great concept, great location and endless supply of customers. But their priority lies with operating the business and not with serving customers
4
Decided to try after hearing much about this place. Staff friendly and courteous. Service prompt. Reached at 12.15 noon and our waiting time of 45 mins for our table. Ambience is comfortable but a bit cramp with simple filmsy wooden tables with stripe planks and chair for couples. Food is tasty and price is about SGD$25 per head with drinks, brunch meals and a side dish.Will definitely come again with our daughter soon. :)
4
I've been to Lola's a few times, and swear by their Green Tea Latte. It isn't as sweet as Starbucks, but the aroma is there. Jut that $6.50 is a little pricey for a small glass.I've only tried the brunch menu, and really love the Sunny-side Stacked Sandwich which is served with fries. Thought that the eggs benedict are pretty average though. The table next to me ordered the Bratwurst and it looked really good.Not to forget it's nett price! No service charge or gst
4
I would say that my experience here happened to be only for desserts because i had bak kut teh just neaby. It is a local singaporean dish and i had desserts here! I got the Chocolate tart ($5) and the lemon tart which were both amazing! it's really splendid how delicious the desserts are.The only bad thing is that the waiting time was a little longer than expected. It took us a whole one hour of waiting for this. The other not so nice thing is the size, it is really small and so cramped up it wasn't a cafe that you could have a nice talk because everyone beside you can hear you
