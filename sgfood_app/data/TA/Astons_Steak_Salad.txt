The restaurant is located within the Marina Bay shopping mall. The arrangement is that you select your main course and then help yourself to the copious salad bar. Afterwards there is a 'help yourself' fruit selection and soft ice cream.

Reasonbly priced if one loves the salad buffet. Service okay. Food not bad. Not our first visit. Will return again.
5
There is no service charges and a semi buffet which run the gamut from salad to cooked food. There were 3 choices of soup to choose from. Price is reasonable and no time restriction for the buffet.

The food quality is very good and the price is reasonable. Staff are courteous and efficient. I especially enjoy their signature burger as well as their steak.

Fantastic meals at a great price! Good value! Family atmosphere! Definitely recommend trying. $8 for steak and 2 sides!

Aa a tourist..."Orchard road" is the first word in the mind. And now I can add "Aston" as the alternative to save your budget. Great & healthy

I was very surprised at the fact there is a semi buffet. Went on 2 desperate occasion. Once for dinner, once for lunch. Price is cheaper during lunch express and both serve similar side dishes. It‚Äôs value for money if you can really eat a lot of the sides

My husband, myself, son and daughter in law ate here for an evening meal. Was quite difficult to find being hidden at the back of a shopping mall.Excellent steaks, good salad, good service at a very reasonable price.Was so good that we repeated the performance the next lunch time with both sons and daughters in law, and once again the steaks were excellent.Would definately come back here again

After a shopping expedition one noon, we ate lunch at Aston‚Äôs Steak & Salad on the 3rd floor of Centerpoint. It‚Äôs a cozy place to dine, either alone or with friends. The salad bar was out of this world and would have been worth the visit by itself without ordering any meat. I had already ordered a steak, though, and my husband salmon. My steak came quickly, but the salmon had inadvertently been delivered to someone at another table who had come in after we had. We finally had to ask where our salmon was and wait for another half hour! The steak turned out to be tough but the salmon delicious. For dessert we enjoyed sherbert with various toppings. Next time we visit, we‚Äôll make a meal out of the extensive, delectable salad bar

We ate here twice while in Singapore once on our way to England then on our way back home. The first time it was a Friday night and it was very busy but we managed to get a table as we were early the second time was a Tuesday night and it was not so busy. The prices for a Steak was very reasonable for Singapore as it includes a Salad Bar, Vegetables and the Steak comes with Chips or Potato and there is soft service ice cream and topping. IT is unlimited soft drinks and tea and coffee. Good service from the staff and you do not have to wait long for the main meal but you can help yourself to the salad bar while you are waiting. It is a good place to eat if you are on a budget as you can get a steak from about $S30.00 which includes the salad bar and tea, coffee and soft drink

The steaks were great ,good serving size ,very reasonable prices ,no extra add on like service charge and tax to bill what you see is the actual price .service efficient and friendly .

Upstairs at Clarke Quay central. Had a nice piece of grilled fish, with two sides, either baked potato, corn cob, chips or veggies, very enjoyable. The place filled up quickly after we arrived, and the staff were busy but attentive.

Situated in a remote corner of Centrepoint, this restaurant is quiet & cozy. The food's average with a salad bar that has a satisfactory spread for the price (includes drinks & softserve ice cream). If you're on a budget, this place will do :)

Came here with my fianc√©e, the prices here is affordable and cheap. $16 for a black pepper steak.
Been here couple of times and it's worth it for dining on a budget üëçüèºüëçüèº

I was there on a Friday night and there was queue which was not a long queue but still we waited for about 20 minutes. Before they show you to your table, you have to place your order near the entrance and make payment. My wife and I ordered the Fiery Chicken which was brought back by popular demand.The good thing about this Astons outlet is that most of the main course ordered included the salad bar buffet. So, while waiting for the main course, we could start with the salad bar with:1. Different lettuce and pepper too.2. A few type of soups for you to whet your appetite.3. Coffee, tea, soda for your thirst and ice cream.4. Nachos.5. Fruits and pre-mixed salad including coleslaws.Our main course was Fiery Chicken - back by popular demand according to them.Mine was served with baked potatoes with a bit of butter. A bit boring.So, went to the salad bar and get some cheese for the bake potatoes. At a buffet, sometimes Coke is just too simple and ice cream is nothing interesting. What can you do? Make an ice cream float yourself

The chicken was cooked to perfection! The wagyu burger wasn't bad but didn't stand out. The patty itself was ok but maybe should have added some crispy pickles, veggies or crisps to the burger.The salad bar offers a great variety of salads, soups, and free flow of drinks.Totally worth the 23sgd/pa

This would have to be hands done the best casual freshest all you can eat restaurant I have ever been too. The salads were so fresh. Everything I ate was fresh and tasty. Can't rave enough about the quality and freshness of the food. Staff friendly and attentive. The lemon/lime chicken was possibly no WAS the best cooked chicken I've ever eaten in a restaurant. Fully cooked but so tender and juicy and practically melted in my mouth. We went 2 nights in a row. The salad bar was just as good as the first. The serving sizes for the meat were HUGE so we just chose the salad bar the second night. The soup had different choices on the second night but still 3 choices (clear vegetable soup was the only same soup both nights). All the soups were DELICIOUS. Yum yum. I was very impressed. Will DEFINITELY return when I go to Singapore next time. Two thumbs up.

Always came here in weekend & order a chicken cutlet (given quite thick and big portion) and my wife will order just the salad buffet to eat along. The selection on the salad and buffet bar is nice and staff really ensure the food bring refill accordingly
5
Let's just say that you're having a full salad buffet with my Favourite mash potato, onion rings, etc if you purchase a main course. So we had the golden fried fish was was crispy and marinated with pepper under the golden crust! And also the pepper chicken which was succulent but could have done with more sauce. But what really bowled me over was the free flow salads with mountains of choices, free flow coffee and soft drinks! The entire dinner for 2 with the above mentioned with no time limit was like under $50! All the staff are hardworking and efficient and sometimes too keen to get their work done. But overall they are attentive, constantly topping up food and clearing dishes. Well done!

The food here never disappoints me.They have a good system here where order and payment are first made before meals are served. Good system for a busy restaurant.Food portion is worth the price. Service is also very quick.They will cook your steak again if it is not to your liking/ordered.Staffs are attentive and quick

Received a warm smile the moment we stepped into the restaurant. Supposed to order first before entering but the manager quickly allocated a table for us first as he saw we are with a baby. He asked us to settle down first before deciding what to eat. Tables are not too close apart thus there's privacy. Lots of variety on the buffet table. Steak is good. May consider having a promotion every now and then. Overall a great place

We knew that most shopping complexes tended to have restaurants so we entered the Centrepoint on Orchard Road looking for an evening meal. On enquiring on the ground floor whether there was a food court in the premises we were directed to the top floor where we were told there was a place serving 'western food'. Surprisingly it turned out to be the only eating place in the entire building.The floor where this restaurant is located looks as if it is being renovated and we gathered that Astons had only opened for the first time there on the Friday and we were there on the Monday. Consequently there were no diners when we arrived but there were plenty of staff who were very keen to explain how their restaurant operated. Ordering a main meal ‚Äì mainly burgers of different types ‚Äì one could have the add on salad for an extra Singapore $11.90. The salad bar was extensive with a huge choice so that settled matters ‚Äì a Meat Superburger, a Wagyu Beef Burger and two add on salads.During the time we were there other customers started arriving to the delight of the manager and his new staff! I won't say there were any teething problems but I believe this restaurant has great potential and the food is very good indeed. It should prove to be a very popular addition to the Orchard Road eating establishments

Astons provides good food with no gst and service charge.i enjoyed the chargrilled chicken before..well cooked with sauce,chicken tasted delicious.the mushroom soup come with two slices of hot toasted garlic bread.the fried fish is so big and enough for two small eaters...my hubby enjoy his steak so much that he is looking forward to another lunch or dinner here
5
The place looked nice and the ambience was great. There were a lot of people so you know the place serves something great. I had the Black Pepper Chicken steak. It was a big portion and it was delicious! I'll be coming back for sure so I could try their other options

I've passed by Astons Steak & Salad probably more than 20 times before and never got to deciding to eat there... until last week.At first I found it strange to order just before you get seated, especially that their specialty is steak and this place doesn't look to me as a fast food restaurant. Anyway, I managed to quickly decide what to order seeing that there were a couple of people behind me waiting in line.I went for the Honey Glazed Ribs. I was then asked which 2 side dished I would like to go with it. I also ordered iced tea.I was then shown to my table and didn't wait long for my order to arrive. I told myself that something this fast means that the meat would be overcooked or tough as it could be waiting for in an oven for hours already, but I was actually pleasantly surprised that the ribs were tender and nicely fell off the bone! A good place to go if you like meats

Good food! Try lemon lime chicken, mac& cheese, garden salad.You can select the steak of chicke or beef that comes with two hot or cold side dishes. you can select what you want to add as ur side menu. If you are a chicken lover try lemon lime chicken. The souce is yummylicious. Its bit sweet but try Rootbeer Frost.cheap dinner for 15dollars

We regularly visit this restaurant in CentrePoint - it is definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore! So much choice in the salad bar and the side dishes bar. Includes absolutely anything you can think of to add to your salad or a side dish to add to your main. All the food is always so fresh. For dessert there is the choice of fresh cut fruits or lovely ice cream with toppings. The Sirloin tips with mushroom sauce is my favourite main dish. The staff are always very friendly, very good atmosphere, comfortable seats, enough space, never have to wait for a table, great fast service. What could you possibly want more from a restaurant? It is perfect.The free flow drinks section is great and includes tea and coffee and the price of drinks and buffet is all included in the price of each main meal. It is great value!!I am not really sure what the other reviewer is talking about saying he had to order his food at the door because we never have to do this at Astons in CentrePoint. You sit down as in a normal restaurant and order from the menu. Maybe he is getting confused with the other Aston in Escape which is a completely different restaurant with a different system of ordering at the door and no buffet. We did not like that Aston in Escape and don't go back.I highly recommend the Astons Steak and Salad restaurant in CentrePoint

The food at Astons was quite ok but the idea of having to review the menu at the door and order before you can sit down is simply weird. What happened to the idea of sitting down, ordering a drink and deciding what you wanted as you soak in the atmosphere. The concept makes it feel like McDonald
