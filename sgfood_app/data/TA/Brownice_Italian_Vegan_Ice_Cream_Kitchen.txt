Had the burrata, strawberry and earl grey ice cream. Everything was delicious. I'd definitely come back here if I return to Singapore.

Read about this place online and came for dinner. Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and the Hawaiian pizza. They were perfect, thin crust, vegan cheese and chicken with a sweet BBQ sauce. Best ever.

We came here for dessert and (as a non-vegan) found the ice cream surprisingly good. The flavours were all a bit non-traditional - no vanilla or strawberry here! but pleasant enough. I had the mint - as labelled, it was pleasantly minty. Worth a try.

Their waffle with ice cream, fudge, and nuts is amazing. We got the chocolate one. Waffle was freshly made and perfectly crisp, topped with chocolate fudge, nuts, and dark chocolate ice cream (you can choose the ice cream flavor). Definitely the best dessert I've ever had!! I couldn't believe it was fully vegan.We also got the waffle fries, which were freshly fries and hot, with a really great seasoning.Their pizzas are amazing. We had the BBQ "chicken" pizza, and it was outstanding. In short, this place serves outstanding decadent food, whether you are vegan or not.

My friends and I took advantage of the amazing lunchtime offer of pizza, soup & salad for less than $10! Portions are small but combined are more than enough for a hearty lunch. Vegan hawaiian pizza was awesome, it’s been so long since I had decent vegan ham and the vegan cheese topping was also really good. Great value overall, will be back

I only went once for dinner but I cant wait to go back. The prices were good, so was the food. And make sure to end your dinner with an ice cream for dessert ! A great place to introduce vegan food to your meat lovers friends. Maybe one comment would just be to updo the wall paintings that look a bit dated but that's it

We were introduced to Brownice by my sister and we loved the food there.First time- we ordered pizza delivery via Foodpanda. BBQ and Truffle porcini pizza.Food was deliciousSecond and subsequent time- we dined in the café itself. Ordered some pasta dish to share (Creamy mushroom penne, spaghetti Bolognese, spicy creamy tomato fusilli) Creamy mushroom penne was delicious but strangely it seems more like blended mushroom sauce ( probably due to the lack of cream usage here)Spaghetti Bolognese was good with minced mock ham Spicy creamy tomato fusilli was the best as the sauce was really flavorful with olives, button mushrooms etc.Vegan pizza was quite surprisingly for me, delicious as I expect non cheese pizza to be weird, they manage to replicate a creamy almost cream cheese kind of texture.My sister love the vegan ice-cream that they serve, with their earl grey flavor being my favorite. However, do note, they do not have vanilla ice-cream so no vanilla ice-cream for their root beer float ( chose coconut ice-cream as recommended by staff) Overall, food was great, just a tad expensive for some. Be prepared for at least $20 if dining alone for a drink and pasta/pizza. But worth it for a vegan café. (They have weekdays promotion that I feel is quite worth it.

We traveled to Joo Chiat purposely to try out this place after reading the positive review. This cafe is located along East Coast Road at Joo Chiat, not East Coast Park, in a double storey pre-war shophouses. As such, the cafe is narrow but long. But surprisingly, children high chairs were provided.We tried the BBQ Chicken pizza, gnocchi, waffles fries & ice cream. The BBQ Chicken used soya chicken & vegan cheese and was a highlighted as popular dish. The soya chicken is very chewy, but the smoky taste is too meaty for my liking. The toppings are a lot but the sauces are too much, and did not help to enhance the flavour. The mushroom gnocchi was quite light, but lack of flavour. First bite was ok, but I thought of adding chilli from second bite onwards.The waffles fries was crunchy but looked like it had been fried a few times, and tasted too salty. The plus point was drinking water was provided FOC & self service.Though the food are not as good as expected, we still decided to try the ice cream. We tried more than 5 flavours and eventually picked Hazelnut & Chocolate. As there are made from rice milk which has milder taste compare to milk, you get to taste the real flavour. So the hazelnut tasted like I was eating hazelnut! Overall, I would rate this place as average. Definitely will not come all the way to eat. If I am in the neighbourhood, there are plenty more choices along the same road which look much more attractive.

If I lived near Brownice I would visit three times a week at least! Their vegan gelatos are to die for, and they're much healthier than standard ice cream as they're made with brown rice syrup and contain much less sugar, fat and calories. I love the root beer float, and the garlic waffle fries are amazing
