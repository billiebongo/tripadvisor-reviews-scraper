One of the top Bah Kut Teh in town, within walking distance of Hotel Boss where I stayed. Totally worth the price. Thumbs up!

Restaurant is right at the corner of Hotel Boss. I tried Founder Bak Kut Teh with rice and a stir-fried choy sum dish. Tasty soup and good service.

There are many Bah Kut Teh places in Singapore but this is what I like most. In terms of taste, this still a place to come back and try. The restaurant also offers more choices to match with your dish. The place is located just outside Boss Hotel so convenient for those staying in to this hotel. One thing need to improve is consistency and cleanliness of the place.

Orderered the famous "The Founder Bak Kut Tey" with Tang O soup and rice to compliment them. The best part seriously for a meat-lover like me was the Bak Kut Tey soup... The Tang O soup was okay. Heard about it, tried it. Would i come again? Probably after a reasonable gap.

We we're told that the famous meat tea actually same soup for everything ( fish, vegetables, meat born), the vegetable dish we order large one, they served with small one, after we made a complain, they took back and changed large dish but same mount of vegetables, never com

Had Bak Kut here as it is right next to our hotel, went there for breakfast.Bak Kut Teh tastes good but not really special, we orderd pork & vegetable as well.Worth trying if you wanna have a taste on this traditional singaporean food. The price is a bit expensive

This is a typical Singapore style Bak Kut Teh. It has a clear soup base and is located at the corner of Hotel Boss. If you are fan of Singapore style Bak Kut Teh, this outlet is a very decent one to indulge in. The place is clean and is very well air-conditioned too. Try it out if you are in the neighbourhood

Pretty good buk ku teh. Won't say it is the best i have tried but i would say it's definitely one of the better ones in Singapore. Staff in this branch were friendly. A good place to visit to try out a local favourite after a good day of shopping at Bugis Junction across the road

For those who prefer their broth very peppery and not too herbal-tasting, this is it! Long menu; in addition to different ribs, they have offals and tau fu cooked different ways, pig trotters, ngoh hiang , fish and seafood, although abalones may not sell well at $53++. One of the better bak kut teh/gou ru cha placed in town, served in comfortable aircon environment

Very tasty . One of the best I ever tried. The short ribs has fat meat so it tastes better then the popularity ribs which my friend ordered
5
This is a good place when you are starving after midnight and want to try singaporean dish such bak kit teh. Very tasty, tender meats, many soup variants, good service, and fine price.
They also sell something like bak kut teh spices packages.
Very nice....

To me, bak kut teh is all about the soup. When the soup fails, nothing else matters. The soup here lacks confident which results in so-so flavor and doesn't make any lasting impression. Other side dishes are pretty standard and service was excellent.
5
The price little expensive side. But the soup is really delicious. More of a tourist food outlet because of the pricing and brand name.
4
Bak Kut Teh is my favorite and this place offers a really good taste. There are plenty choices and with different levels of spices, you can request.

This is a nice healthy, delicious, and clean food in the area.
Do not miss is you pass by or try other branches in other area in Singapore. We love it much partucularly the noodle soup.
5
I've tried many other bak kut teh but I prefer Founder Bak Kut Teh's peppery taste. Best part about this place is you can go there at midnight and they're still open.
2
The soup is not bad to be fair, but the staffs seem very cold, unresponsive and dislike what they are doing. It is my first day staying in the Hotel Boss which it happens to share the same building with the restaurant. I was planing to have another few meals down here considering it's one of the closest restaurants around, guess I have to make new plans

The bakkut teh is on the spicy side (very peppery) yet so delicious if you are also a fan of spiciness. I also love the trio steamed egg (must try!!!) It's a silky goodness and very well seasoned. But from the price point, I find it is also quite expensive comparing to other famous Bakkutteh and service was a bit slow eventhough not many patrons at the time we there

Founder Bak Kut Teh needs little introduction. Most Singaporeans would be familiar with their delicious Bak Kut Teh, or Rou Gu Cha / Pork Rib Soup, which Founder Bak Kut Teh has been serving for over 40 years. In fact, they regularly represent the epitome of Singaporean cuisine, having been appointed by the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) as the heritage hawker to showcase the Singaporean style of Bak Kut Teh. Having expanded beyond their flagship restaurant at Balestier, with their location at Hotel Boss in January 2016, Founder looks set to grow even further.Ambience at Founder is clean and functional. The brightly lit place is clean, neatly spaced with sturdy wooden furniture with marble tops. Pictures of celebrity visits, events, and their accolades adorn the walls, along with brief descriptions of their history, and their founder, Mr. Chua. There is a faint smell of peppery broth which hangs in the air, though this doesn't cause any bother. Atmosphere is open and bustling, and ambient noise levels can be rather loud, especially during peak periods.Service at Founder is efficient and functional, akin to the style of most hawker centres or casual eateries. Staff converse mostly in Chinese Mandarin, and ordering is an efficient, hassle-free affair. As with most such places, turn around of tables is fast, staff are quick to clear away empty / dirty tables and prepare it for the next diners. Fulfillment of orders is just as quick, all dishes arrive more or less at the same time, and diners would rarely have to wait more than 10 minutes for their meal.Food at Founder is all about Bak Kut Teh (White) / Rou Gu Cha / Pork Rib Soup. The pork meat is sourced fresh daily, from 7-month old pigs, which is apparently the optimum age that has the best taste and texture. Their soup / broth is still robust and tasty, with bold peppery notes. The menu has expanded too, Founder now offers a good variety of dishes to suit all palates. Portions of Bak Kut Teh are sized for individuals, but every other dish is designed for communal dining, and must be shared. Prices however, have risen accordingly. Budget about SGD $17 per person for a meal here.When I first started cataloging and blogging about Singapore food back in 2006 / 2007, I had selected Founder Bak Kut Teh as one of my top 3 choices for Bak Kut Teh (White). Today, their consistent quality over the years means they still remain a solid place for Bak Kut Teh, albeit with slightly more premium pricing. Otherwise, I'm very happy with the ambience, service, and food at Founder Bak Kut Teh, and it's a place I have, and still will, return to for more

It is a soup with pepper. Nothing special. Many movie star pictures in the restaurant, does not mean too much.

First time to eat this premises, very clean, acceptable food, must try again to find out other dishes

I had the Bak Kut Teh after they appeared on television to show the method to cook the authentic one.Came with the mindset of just another Bak kut teh restaurants that is overpriced. I saw the price and indeed it is expensive.We order the dough fritter, the braised intestines, 2 bowls of premium ribs and pork knuckles it has a bowl of mee sua and 2 bowls of rice.When the food came, my impression totally changed.This is not an ordinary Bak kut teh restaurant and the soup is too good. More spicy than the rest of the restaurants.If you had tried the famous ah hua bkt or nas bkt, be sure to come and try this.Note: ask them for garlic. It just melt in your mouth

I went there for the first time in September when i was visiting singapore. Since then it a must visit place on every trip. I just love the Bak Kut Teh.. for those who have tried it other places... i would recommend you try here and you will forget other places and for those trying it for the first time... this is the best place to start...i look forward to my next trip and one more round of Bak Kut Teh.

I walked in and browsed through all the pictures on the walls of smiling faces all taken with the founder of the bakut teh. There was a video running, which showed how the bakut teh became famous so I ordered and waited for the food with anticipation.The bakut teh was a real let down. The soup was tepid, and tasted slightly pepperish only. There was no taste of herbs at all.The video promised that the meat on the pork ribs was specially selected for its tenderness. Well, the meat was dry and hard, like if the pork rib had been boiled and then kept in the freezer and then re-boiled a second time. It was definitely not tender at all.Maybe because I was the first customer of the day, I got some leftover stock from the day before because I know what freshly cooked tender ribs taste like. Disappointing

My favourite kind of bak kut teh, peppery soup. Soak your you tiao (dough fritters) into the soup and be happy. You can ask for refill of the soup. I like the pig's organ soup which you can opt for half cooked. It will be very tender but without blood. The fried prawn roll is very nice too. Thumbs up

I love BaK Kut Teh. We tried to eat in Jalan Sultan because we stayed in Hotel Boss. The soup was very hot and very tasty. I dont have any comments with the food except the staffs who are very unfriendly and keeps on gossiping in front of the guests. they look very unhelpful and unhappy with what they are doing. Should train them better.

Cashier staff at Boss Hotel Lavender Branch Founder's Bah Kut Teh shouted at me when i requested refund of the wet tissue and he told me its free I should take the tissue. But he was super unfriendly n shouted at me. His service spoilt my entire dinner experience and my friend's birthday celebration at the branch. This took place on Fri 30 Sep 9.45pm

As our hotel was just around the corner, the taxi driver highly recommended this place as one of the most popular bak kut the chain-store in the area. We were there on a Wednesday night about 8. The popular short ribs were sold out. We ordered the long ribs and fried fritters. The soup was just warm, mild in flavor, the ribs were overcooked and 'dry', but the service was good and the place was clean. Overall, not very impressed

My first dining experience at this food chain, service team was prompt and friendly. Surrounding was clean and proper, which had scored much in my heart as it is 1 of the determining factors if I would only visit a foodie place 2nd time. Food especially the soup is on the peppery side but acceptably tasty. Pricing might be on the higher side but I might return to 1 of its outlets because I can get good food and service
