It’s a cozy place for intimate gathering for small group. Food is great and interesting concept. Will definitely be back again.
5
We chose the chef's selection of small plates to share. Each one was excellent and the sequence worked really well. A lot of creativity went into these dishes. A delight and a wonderful evening.
3
Nice charming place. We had lunch omakase. Appetizers were generally fine. Noodles and mains were disappointing. Will return only if I m looking for a place for drinks and (bar) food
4
Cosy space nestled at Dempsey. Food was great although portions were a tad small. Love the set up and ambience !

This place looks like a barn with the twinkling lights inside - it looks like such a charming place. The food was good but nothing to remember. Portions are small.

Our experience at Morsels was underwhelming, mainly due to the food. The service and staff were wonderful and prompt. However, it was the food itself that was NOT particularly thrilling. The dishes were generally average with some interesting flavours explored. However, most dishes went by without making a real impression. The real disappointment was with our main which was the Salmon - it was meant to be a warm dish from what I understand, but was served at room temperature which was unpleasant in the mix in which it was presented. To make matters worse, the banana cake dessert was dry and did not feel fresh, the cream and white chocolate mixture did not sit well with us (but it could be just something we are not used too). Overall, nothing completely terrible but definitely felt that it was not worth the price of the meal

Found this nice little restaurant in Dempsey. What I really like about this place is the unique taste and flavors of every dish. Everything is freshly prepared and "homemade". The taste is fresh and colorful. You know you are eating real food individually prepared. It's a little on the expensive side but it's worth it.
3
TLDR - so much promise, but very expensive while falling short on too many dishes.A friend organized a table for 8 on Sat night. Only 1 other table was occupied which was surprising. Our hostess had already selected the menu with the chef, so we sat back and just enjoyed the night.The food was hot and miss - oysters amazing, deviled eggs rubbish. Scallop amazing. Pork belly rubbish. Pork rib average. Beef short rib amazing.A vegetarian friend had a 5 course tasting menu ordered, but the kitchen saw this as an after thought, it was awful. Then we got slapped with the bill, sadly not reflective of the standard of food we were served.Lots of ppl seem to recommend this place, but seems got got a bad night in the kitchen
1
It was a real disappointment. Some friends commented that the portion of the main course was so small, good for those with "bird diet". One of the dishes we ordered was "chicken rice". It turned out black glutinous rice and chicken meat that didn't taste like chicken. We had to "abandon" our dinner and not waste our time and calories and headed for other restaurant. We had wanted to make a reservation at 7pm but couldn't as it say Booked. We were there earlier than 7pm, it was almost empty. We don't understand why.
5
I booked a table for four people and we all agreed it was a great choice of venue. Really nice cosy atmosphere, great choice of food including lots of vegetarian options. 2 our of the 4 of us are vegetarian and we ordered a selection of dishes to share, the meat eaters were very happy with the food also. Free corkage on a Tuesday night, 1 bottle per couple. Will definelty go back.
5
The staff was polite and friendly. Because we had no idea on what to order, the staff suggested the Omasake option that was specific to our dietary needs. We had a wonderful experience tasting the different dishes that the chef had prepped.
4
delicious food, great service and atmosphere, but portions tiny! and quite expensive for plate size - we were left feeling hungry!
3
Food was delicious but overpriced. The place looks like a cafe but charges fine dining pricing. The sharing plates are just enough for one.
2
The food value was extremely poor for okay taste and very low volume. The air conditioning
was too high for the small room size.
5
Delicious food in a very nice atmosphere. It's a bit of a hunt to find this place but once you have found it you will not be disappointed. We went for Sunday brunch which consisted mainly of open faced sandwiches. All delicious. We ordered a variety with fish, pork belly and tandoori chicken and even kaya. Lovely iced teas made to order. Deserts equally delicious and beautifully presented. Good service
2
Food is competent but perhaps they try a little too hard being on the cutting edge. Rustic and relaxed surroundings is a little confusing when the menu is so uptight ! After so many layers of complexity the prawn noodle dish lost its identity. The pulled pork pasta was monotonous and the flavours unbalanced. Milo tiramisu was so sweet it ruined the meal Overpricing leads to overpromising and in the end the meal felt a little flat Not a place to consider if you are looking for comfort, soulful food. Be prepared to pay for experimentation and hope you like what results ..
5
This was my third time to Morsels, and my companion's second time. This visit exceeded the others in delivery, quality and presentation. The slow braised Angus beef was simply superb, and the milo tiramisu, a refreshing twist on a favourite. Charming barnyard surrounds too (though the tap in the bathroom spits out water which could spoil your manicure - needs fixing)
5
I love a good meal where every dish is prepared like a work of art, but usually that means high end restaurant ambiance which can feel a bit uptight and formal. Morsels is likely my new favorite restaurant because it's nothing like that. I mean the food is superb but you feel totally relaxed here. The ambiance is warm and friendly, not at all dressy or snobbish. I loved the oysters here... which is a rare statement from me so that says a lot already. We had the omasake so every dish arrived as a surprise. With our 30 dollar chope voucher the meal for 2 was only 100 sgd. Very affordable lunch. Service was also top notch. Can't wait to come back here again
5
We were there for a birthday dinner and wanted somewhere quaint, intimate and comfortable. Morsels fit all the requirements that we wanted., and not forgetting the delicious food that they offer.I especially love the fact that they are unlike the noisy neighbours in Dempsey. The moment you step into this little barn/rustic/country style restaurant you'll feel calm and every attention goes to the food.Portions of the food tend to be small but they are deliciousflavors without say, packed with fresh flavors. Definitely a nice place to be for a quiet dinner
5
Morsels is tucked away in Dempsey Hill, but well worth discovering. Not only are the dishes inspired and inventive, they are absolutely delicious. Despite my being a vegan, I was warmly welcomed, shown a number of items on the menu that could be adapted, and moreover the sous-chef suggested two special dishes on the spot. Morsels chef are truly in touch with their cooking and have a talent for combining various ingredients with surprising and excellent results. The front our house staff are knowledgeable, attentive and happy to recommend a dish or a wine pairing. This restaurant is well deserving of the many accolades it receives and not one to miss
3
In my opinion, a good memorable experience requires a dish that leaves a lasting impression. The service n ambience was okie and the waiter was friendly.. however food wise, everything was good but not spectacular..
4
Good prawn noodles. As usual a good meal at Morsels but air conditioning seemed to be faulty leaving the restaurant a tad stuffy.
5
Really enjoyed it and can't wait to go back. Lovely quaint place with amazing food. The location is not easy to find though...but it adds to the experience.
3
We had the Omasake lunch menu. Dishes were unique, however we felt that for $45/pax, it wasn't very worthwhile. The Omasake menu ended with a fish dish. I think for $45 we should at least have 1 more dessert dish to end it off.
1
Some dishes were ok but some were just plain weird. Portions were tiny. I’ve been there for lunch previously and it was edible, but the omakase was sadly miserable. Service was lousy and the place was too bright any comfortable dinner ambience. Won’t bother to visit again.
4
I was cautious about this restaurant as the reviews had been varied and some had been rather damming.This was not helped by my experience when choosing the wine. The first choice was mentioned as organic on the menu, but had no certification on the bottle, so was rejected. The next bottle mentioned three white grapes on the menu, including Voitngier, a favourite of mine, but the wine was clearly a simple Sauvignon Blanc. So not a great start.BUT the food was delicious and interesting, we had 4 starters and 3 mains between the 4 of us and the amount was fine.The squid risotto was very well flavoured, sweet potato noodles was well balanced and the Duroc pork pasta shells was a profusion of flavours. The prawns with saffron was quite complex. The mains were all varied and lively, with the Magelitza pork fat being the most delicious, (I am slightly biased as I also raise these fantastic pigs in the UK.The pricing is quite top end but I found it difficult to fault the food. The service was good, with almost too many staff for the number of diners.If you understand and appreciate cooking, this is well worth a visit
3
The food itself is lovely, well cooked and Creative...but portions are tiny for the price which takes away from the experience. Been to the former location which was amazing. Sadly it seems that the increase in rent of moving to Dempsey means half portions at twice the price. Massive disappointment
3
We had dinner at the Morsels. Staff were nice and friendly and were helping us decide which dishes to order. The devilled egg (one for $4.50) is a very small portion and can easily eat it up in one mouthful. i think its quite nice, but my friend did not like it. 1824 BEEF TONGUE MUSUBI ($24) tasted nicer that we expected and the portion is reasonable. The most raved risotto - CHARRED HOUSE-POACHED OCTOPUS ($26) - tasted ok. sliced octopus on top were very nicely done and tasted very good. but there is no surprise element in the squid-ink risotto itself. SNAKE RIVER FARMS AMERICAN WAGYU FLAT IRON STEAK ($48) was meant for sharing, but the portion seemed more appropriate for one person. And we feel this is just like other average steak slices. Maybe we were expecting more from the name, wagyu steak and the price for this dish. Surprising (not in a good way), the milo tiramisu ($16) comes in a very big size (a big jar - the size of an average 3-500ml jar). Although the tiramisu tasted ok for us, it is not something that 2 person can finish up. Milo powder seems to be just on the top. its very sweet that i could only eat a few spoonful. My friend tried to eat up the rest but we ended up still leaving a third or so in the jar. we would prefer the dishes to be bigger in portions instead of big dessert. Overall, both of us like the interior and the nice cottage that the restaurant is housed in. Food is average or slightly better than average. Portions of all side/main dishes are very small, except the dessert tiramisu that is huge
5
Hidden away round the side streets of Dempsey, off the beaten track, is a little restaurant set in what looks like a converted barn. A simple layout with a few tables gives it a very personal feel. The decor is quaint, with lots of trinkets and nick-nacks to keep the eyes moving and distracted!The menu is small, but the food was superb. As the name might suggest, the portions are small and ideal for putting in the middle of the table and sharing. We shared the ribs, steak and some starters and thoroughly enjoyed it. For drinks, the wine list was very full, and my wife requested a mocktail which the bar man asked her choice of flavours and made up one off menu which was delicious!Very much recommended and also in the EAT Singapore book for added benefits

It was a surprise advance birthday celebration from my hubby and having chance upon this restaurant with pretty good reviews, he made a reservation online leaving a note to say its a surprise birthday dinner for his wife. He received a call just before dinner with the restaurant asking for my name and offering a little birthday dessert at the end of the meal.The restaurant has a rustic country decor, very quaint and appealing. First look at the menu it seems pretty fancy and chi chi fusion. Undecided, we went for the omakase menu which at $85 per person is actually very good value. Each course was served for diners to share. The meal kicked off the meal with Oysters on half - a taste from the sea with an asian twist with the aromatic dressing.Next up was the burrata salad made fancy with olive soil and deep fried mee swa, an appetising teaser for the meal ahead.Swordfish belly with some shaved root vege came next, that was ok.The steamed venus clam in this awesome fig broth is one of my favourite! The broth was amazingly tasty. Wish they gave a bigger serving for this!The tiger prawns with grits came next. Though i am not a fan of grit, it married well with the prawns!The squid ink risotto with charred octopus was another winner for me. Thoroughly flavourful with the octopus grilled to perfection!The sakura chicken breast with pulut hitam rice, pickled beet dressing and chicken liver mousse was surprising good. Though i am not a breast meat fan, the chicken was really moist and tender. The chicken skin crackling was a sinful touch! This course serves a hearty portion.Final course was the beef with some barley type grain which was tasty and filling!The omakase menu excludes dessert and besides the surprise birthday chocolate cake and a lovely birthday song from Musa the ever so friendly and nice waiter, i had to order milo tiramisu which was a joyful end to the meal.They recommended a wine by the bottle that was actually quite nice and not that expensive.What i really like about this restaurant is the fact that despite the food being rather fine dining chi chi fusion, pricing was reasonable, ambience was rather casual and not pretentious, service was friendly and attentive. All in all, the meal is not super pricey but neither was it cheap, but you'll definitely get your money's worth
5
The Omakase menu were quite nice and reasonably priced. Tiramiso is one of the best I tasted in Singapore! The ambiance of the restaurant is really nice as well. Will come again.
4
we ordered the set lunch, the appetizer surprised us and if the prawn bisque has stronger flavour and not so spicy, i guess the meal would be perfect.
5
Second time here and many more to come. New dishes on the menu were great! Food never fails to impress :)
2
Had great expectations for this award winner but unfortunately not a single dish worked for us. It was either too underwhelming or bland. Not exciting and sadly, no soul.
4
Food was very good and quality of ingredients used TOP notch. Beef was excellent. Dessert - jackfruit ensemble was disappointing as no hint of jackfruit but Milo tiramisu was good. Quantity can be improved.
5
Lovely quaint place, with rustic warm feel. Excellent food. Especially the Hirame Kingfish ans the Milo Tiramisu. Will go back definitely :)
5
This place was lovely. It had a quaint, country feel to the interior. The food, service and drinks were all excellent. We had an assortment of dishes and they were all very well done. I had their seasonal cocktail, which was very good. It was very high quality without being pretentious
5
I went to Morsels for dinner to celebrate with my husband. We had some lovely dishes we shared. As I was facing the kitchen I saw a tub filled with their homemade kimchi and asked for a sample as my husband Andy I both love kimchi. The chef herself prepared as a sampler of the most delicious kimchi I ever had (outside Korea). Such a great. We had as a main the clams. Wow! The broth is to die for. Also for sharing we had the beef short rib. The meat was tender and the sauce yummy. To en dit we had 2 deserts. For sure their version of Tiramiso with Milo was the winner. All stuff was lovely but Musa went the extra mile. Such a great guy and such a personal service. The athmopshere of the place is lovely and the service makes you feel as if you were th Einladung customer (in a good way ;-) They have an excellent wine list and quite the exquisit drink menu. We had a beautiful crisp Sauvignon Blanc. Th einlud mini critique here is that the wine could have been colder for the first glass. But the bottle was placed on ice and at the right temperature in no time. Will have to go back for more! Thank you for a great evening!

I have been to Morsels a couple of times when they were located in Mayo. There, I found the food interesting and yummy which was why I decided to take my guests from Australia to the restaurant in Dempsey yesterday, thinking that they may enjoy a different cuisine other than our local food. Here is why I have made a horrible mistake... When I called the restaurant to make a reservation for 6 people at 7, they told me I have to leave by 8.30. Straight away I told them to cancel as I wasn't about to rush my guests to finish their dinner just because it's their restaurant's policy. Having said that, the guy on the phone changed his tune and said they will make an exception for me so I said fine. Now, I wished he had stood by the so called policy. Anyways, the menu had so few pages of food and endless pages of drinks. Makes me wonder if I was in a bar instead. We didn't quite understand the menu so we asked the server to recommend. To cut the long story short, non of the starters nor the mains was anything like the food I had tasted when they were in Mayo. Everything that came out tasted terrible. The pasta was way undercooked, the pork and the ribs were so salty. I wonder if the chef even taste the food whist cooking. Simply put, we just didn't know what we were eating any more. I had to keep apologising to my guests as the dishes came out. Not only did it taste horrible, the food was served barely warm and tiny portions for the price charged. I had to order bread to supplement the meal and even that they charge me for it and gave only six miserable pieces of bread. Even the complimentary dessert didn't taste good at all. All in all, I ended up paying almost six hundred for the dinner and drinks and had to apologise profusely to my guests for taking them there and sending them home with a stomach barely filled. I was embarrassed and disappointed. This is sad, I wished Petrina was there yesterday. Maybe the food wouldn't taste that badly and the service would have been better. And what a joke, the restaurant was barely half filled and they wanted us out quickly
3
I came with high hopes for Morsels, but the it was the overall service and atmosphere that let down my experience. The food was lovely, but was marred by the rather brash service. It would be best to let a diner finish his meal and ask if they are done before whisking the dish off the table as you walk by. Having to ask where our mains were after waiting half an hour and seeing other diners who arrived after us get served many dishes before us, was a little annoying. There was a lack of warmth to the service and more of an arrogant 'I'm doing you a favour by serving you your meal' feel. A down-to-earth attitude would be much better suited to the easy going barn-like interior. Can't fault the food though - delicious & well presented
5
We had a 3 hour lunch and the staff were attentive without being bothersome the whole time. Food was delicious with some old favourites and new items on the menu.
5
Excellent food.... worthy of their win as the Best Restaurant in the World Gourmet Summit 2017.
Small plates but delicious and well presented
5
Quirky, eclectic and really interesting and unusual food. Sort of Asian fusion. Almost every course we had tasted superb. It's quite small place so book a table. Nice selection of craft beers and gins from all over the world as well. Will come back here.

Tucked inside Dempsey, Morsels is a charming restaurant with a well-curated, tight menu. We went for brunch, and it was easy to miss the nondescript main door (it's adjacent to Long Beach seafood restaurant). Once inside, we were ensconced in a shabby chic interior that somehow reminded me of Goldilocks and the Three Bears...it felt very comfortable and cosy. We had deviled eggs, 2 kinds of smorresbrod (Norwegian salmon and Tiger Prawns), and the Milo Dinosaur Tiramisu.The deviled eggs were okay...I wasn't bowled over but it wasn't bad either. Both smorresbrods had a refreshing taste... the tiger prawns one had Eastern influences and balanced out this Scandinavian speciality. My friend who had just been to Copenhagen said it tasted like she was back in the city, so that was quite an authentic experience. I liked the side salads as well...most salads that are served on the side are soggy after getting drenched in their dressing; the Morsels version was crunchy and less was definitely more -- it brought out the fresh taste of the micro greens. The milo dinosaur tiramisu was a lot of fun -- by this, I mean, there was an unexpectedly strong rum filling in the centre which was surprising and showed a playful side to the otherwise seriously studied menu. The infused tea was great too --we had the rose infusion one (can't quite remember the full ingredients), and the flavour lingered on even after 3 refills of hot water
3
We had to wait what seemed like forever for our food to arrive and when it did arrive, the portions lived up to their name, they were tiny albeit very tasty. The Japanese theme makes for an interesting menu and their sake is good. They generously provided complementary wine with each course. The staff were very busy because the place was so full.
5
This is an intimate place with a wonderful vibe and delicious food. Our party of 3 had the set menu and was it ever delicious! All food was prepared for sharing - small bites but filling nonetheless. We enjoyed the tiramisu for dessert (wasn't included in the set menu). Every course was beautifully presented and tasted wonderful. Service was quite nice and attentive. I would definitely recommend this place - a good option in the Dempsey Hill area of Singapore. We were sorry to not meet the chef ...
5
Had the Omakase course at Morsels. The food was thoughtful, creative and most of all tasted great. Fusion is pretty often a hit and miss affair. We had ten dishes and they were all hits. The Steamed Venus Clams in fig broth and Firecracker Duroc Pulled Pork Oricchiette were standouts
1
 i booked table, and the day of hte reservation, was informed that only fixed menu available. With Gin pairing. Very restricted. When i was there ( could not book another place ) guests at other table didn't have the fix menu. Reason by waiter, was due to diet restriction HUH!!!Then most of the food was cold, we had to ask for every drink, served after food for a while ( no more pairing but chasing )A very disapointing experience.Gave us a discount, but he evening was spoiled
3
We were thoroughly impress during our first visit for the early dinner deal and decided to go again. However, the 'wow factor' wasn't there because there has been no introduction to any new taste. The oxtail for actually very average, just to fill the stomach.
3
The beef noodle broth at lunch was amazing! The very expensive devilled egg $4.50 for 1/2 egg was on descript though
5
Well organized and thanks for the birthday blessing. staffs are professional on the food and wine and made good recommendation.
4
The food here was prepared from fresh, good quality ingedients. It was well prepared and beautifully presented. It was very tasty. However, as the name of the restaurant informs us and as the staff were at pains to point out to us, the portion sizes are meant to be small. Go here for the good quality food but be prepared for the prices
3
Had dinner there with two friends. Recommended to go there since it is supposedly popular in Little India and moved to Dempsey. Food quality is actually not bad but they are strangely small portions - I guess they are tapas style serving so the dishes are meant to be small so when a dish is shared by 3, it's really little. One spoon and you are done with that dish. They are nice dishes so I wished they are bigger! Guess you just need to order more than half a dozen for 3 to share? For a Monday night, it was crowded. Guess they have earned their reputation. Actually I walked away that night hungry and still wondering what so great about this restaurant. Not sure I will go again.
4
We came for their World Gourmet Submit Set lunch, which is $45++ per head, with wine paring add $35++, good value for 4-course meal. The setting is feminine farm house. Food is fusion and service is casual. There are about 30 seats plus two bar counters. It was Friday lunch and they seems short of staff. We waited half an hour for our first course. The person who explained to us is inaudible, as there is no acoustic. They made a mistake on our main course ordering, which we had repeated twice when we placed it. However, they did a customer recovery immediately, by offering us an extra dessert. The entire lunch took more than one and a half hours. Food is creative and well presented, with some gaps here and there. I will give them full marks for trying!
4
Morsels (now at Dempsey) has just won Restaurant of the Year (in Singapore) under the helm of Petrina Loh.I just remembered that I hadn't posted my photos and thoughts about the dinner in Nov 2016. It was a curated dinner by Petrina for a party of 7.The fusion element of local dishes like char siu hit the right note. The beef was excellent. The only grouse that I had was that the portions were too small if I can compare the the same shared plate concept of Candlenut.I hope to try Morsels again ...in Dempsey soon
4
Great food. We had the a la carte menu. Small plates allowed us to try different dishes. Will try the omakase menu next time. Cosy decor, lovely ambience but the air-conditioning needs to work better. It was very warm and humid when I was there
4
tucked away in a corner of Dempsey this little restuarant is small and cozy. We had ounch and the food taste and presentation was excellent. Again sometimes ratings can be a function of expectations, I went with no expectations as I had never heard of it and was pleasantly surprised. For someone else with raised expectations maybe it would be different. I will go back
3
We had a lovely lunch at morsels. Good variety of dishes - delicious and beautifully presented. However it was really hot at the restaurant. The aircon was blowing warm air. The staff however insisted it was fine. Service other than that was good.
5
Great food and service; good Asian fusion with personable service. Cosy ambience! A tad warm in the pm but nothing too off-putting. Good omakase menu - yummy oysters, lovely mussels, devilled egg and watermelon salad.
1
We booked our dinner for the express omakase at 6.15pm for 4pax on 10 March 2017. 2 of us reached the restaurant at 6.15pm and advise them we can start the dinner as our friend will be slightly late. They served the dinner at 6.45pm and we finished our dinner slightly before 8pm. When the bill came, we were charged $85 per pax for omakase dinner instead of $65 for the express omakase.When they served the dinner, they did not mentioned about the charges and we thought we will be charged $65 per pax as what I had make the reservation for at Chope.The supervisor then explained that its because we were late. However we were not late and we reached at 6.15pm and told them can serve dinner immediately.Its definitely an awful experience to be charged at a higher price when the diners are not being informed before hand
4
The food was flavourful. The sake that we bought was really good. It is the one with the LED Dream yeast.
5
This was my second visit in less than a month, and boy was I glad that I did. The squid ink risotto is truly a revelation!
4
This young bunch's food is interesting, well presented, and very good. Morsel's atmosphere is very relaxed and casual. I would like to go again. But...be careful, its on the pricier side and its easy to rack up a big bill from small plates.
5
We had a great time! The duck is absolutely to die for. We tried lots of different dishes, each and everyone were delicious and pleasant surprise
2
I went with a few friends, The food was mostly good, but the portions were tiny, there were 'sharing plates' but you d have to be a mouse to do so. The mains at best were small. We ordered loads of bread which cost us 5 bucks an order, we ordered 4 times,and the waiting staff didn't seem on the ball.i felt it was also expensive, ambience lovely, a cute little spot, but the meal was disappointing in many ways.
2
Although the food was well executed, the meal was not satisfying because all you got was a taste of each dish. Even those with small appetites were left hungry. Disappointing experience
3
Had read reviews previously but the new place at Dempsey did not have the items in reviews anymore. The food was OK. Ordered oden, Tiger Prawns, King fish, squid ink risotto, and sharing plate pork jowl. don't be deceived even tho it says sharing plate. There was just enough for 1 person portion. For small portions, usually you'd expect greater tastes. Unfortunately, morsels failed to deliver except on the pork jowl. Would I come back? Nah. I'm a small girl and wasn't full after the meal.
4
First off, the rustic interior of their new restaurant was just very warm and welcoming, something everyone in my party agreed upon. As for the menu — which was chef's choice for Valentine's Day dinner — the dishes were good with fairly interesting ingredient pairing. Although, I would struggle to say that the food was great. There were moments where I felt the dishes just needed that little something to take it up a notch. That said, I would definitely like to return to go at their usual menu. I did also have a couple of their house cocktails, which were decent as well. I recommend going in a group to enjoy dinner on one of their long tables.
5
Terrific food, great atmosphere, but the are moving next week to Dempsey Hill. Loved the pumpkin pancakes, mushroom toast and the barramundi. Coconut dessert was outstanding, as well. Very unique tastes and combinations, well done!!We sat at the bar as we didn't have a reservation, which was great as we had a nice conversation with the restaurant team. We will definitely look them up in the new location. I'm sure the food will be as terrific, hope they capture the ambience too
4
In the middle of quiet, dark Mayo street lay Morsels dishing out tasty food that I have never tried before. It took me a while to find the place, given how dark the shophouses were but it is a whole new world when you enter. The food is interesting, European (I think) with Asian influences. All in all tasty though the portions are a tad small. I left still hungry and had supper nearby
5
7-course tasting menu was excellent as was the service. Drinks a little pricey, if they could change this it would be welcome as the restaurant is not easy to locate, even with Google Maps.
5
Great food, brilliant execution! The fusion match were very well thought thru, brings a lot of surprises in flavors
5
The Omakase meal prepared by the chef was delicious and each dish has it unique presentation. Highly recommended.
5
We arrived at 630 and decided to take advantage of the early bird discount for Omakase. It was a good decision. We must have had 7 to 8 very excellent dishes! Well worth the experience!
5
I think it is value here. Location is a bit far but food is good. Service was good. They are receptive to client's needs.
4
we were attracted by the new menu during this visiting. Absolutely love the heirloom tomato with burrata. Never knew Bak Choy could taste great raw!
5
Service was attentive and prompt. Food was very well done and inventive. The squid ink risotto and wagyu beef were exceptionally tasty and creative.
5
Went on a weekday night, was quiet with only a few patrons. Dishes served up were of small portions (as the restaurant name suggests) so they recommend 6 dishes for 2 people, which was just about right.All the dishes were very special, pretty and tasty.A bit pricey but worth the unique experienc
5
It is rare for me to go into a restaurant without expectations and still be blown away. Dishes were fueled with top quality ingredients and prepared to perfection, and without pretence. Ambience was delightfully surreal enough to take us deep into the soundtrack that was immaculately chosen...will definitely return
3
Visited for dinner on a Friday evening with a friend. We felt lazy so ordered the omakase menu. We asked if the menu would include the beef tongue which was listed on the chalkboard as a special. The friendly server told us the omakase usually does not include it but he will make a special arrangement for us. That was a treat! The menu had a generous 7 or 8 dishes (we lost count). All were of a decent standard, but the dishes were served too fast and we felt way too rushed until the 4th course when we requested them to slow down. It was much better thereafter. Overall, we enjoyed our experience at this cosy restaurant
4
I liked the ambience of the place, small and comfortable for friends and family. The food selection is not large, there were a few hits and misses. Just stick to the chef's recommendation as a start.
4
Quaint and charming restaurant with really good food. Hubs and I had an excellent date night here and will be back for sure!
5
This place was a gem. Lovely small plates of food that surprised and delighted. The Omakase at S$55 from 6-7:30pm made it really good value.
5
It's nice to know that they're still around after a few years in this era of establishments opening and closing seemingly in the blink of an eye. And that octopus and squid ink risotto dish - I hope they NEVER take it off the menu.

Morsels has a number of things going for it. Excellent food, great vibe and extremely friendly service. We've eaten here three times and it has been outstanding every time. Don't miss this one.

Food came in small servings, morsels of them. Was there twice in the past fortnight. Once for lunch and another for dinner. They are only open for lunch on Fridays. The lunch sets are $32 and you get 3 courses, an appetiser, a main and dessert. Over our two visits, we tried almost everything on their menu! Servings were small but every dish was excellent. Special mention for their squid ink risotto with octopus. Cooked to perfection! Worth a visit just for this dish! They have a very limited dessert menu. The tiramisu was good but ouch! Expensive! It comes in a mason jar and costs a whopping $15

The food was absolutely fantastic. They provided an extremely unique take on what would have otherwise seemed to be fairly common dishes. The scallop ceviche that was served like a dip with home made corn chips were simply amazing. A surprisingly and pleasant twist to a classic buratta salad were the addition of raw chinese vegetables and the use of persimmon rather than tomatoes. The salted egg yolk sauce on the squid ink risotto added an interesting dimension to an otherwise classic dish. The nori pesto soba served with an incredibly fresh pan fried barramundi was my absolute favourite.Would highly recommend this place

First, the service was really bad, the waiters didn't care at all. We had to pour the wine and water ourselves!!!!! When i asked them to explain me the dish they just served me, it was like asking them 100000 sgd. Our plates were dirty and the waiters kept on bringing new dishes to share but NO NEW CLEAN PLATE FOR US. Above all, The food was TERRIBLE and way too salty. The prices were different from the ones I saw on their website so what a surprise when I saw the menu at the restaurant. At the end, i paid 300 sgd for the worst dinner i've ever had.My worst experience in Singapore. (If I could have rated ZERO out of five, i would have done it

Bryan and Petrina's serves out the best fusion food by far. The blends of flavors, ingredients and cooking style suits our Asian taste buds. It's unlike some Fusion foods where the various combinations are sort of forced to exist together on your plate! Morsels' dishes simply just come together like a well written symphony! Must add that Morsels never fail to amaze 1st timers....dish after dish after dish. It's elicit the usual signs of head noddings and thumbs up!Our first time taste was a distant memory...but we have been coming back for more of our good old favorites and to savor's Bryan's and Petrina's specials and exciting new dishes! Well done Morsels! Mike n Gerr

Great experience. Service was fantastic and we sat at the bar the over looked the open kitchen (highly recommend you do so!). Each dish was fantastic and couldn't find fault in anything. We especially liked the squid ink risotto with grilled octopus and salted egg sauce - textures and depth of flavors just amazing.
5
We had the signature squid ink risotto with octopus, as well as smoked crab meat devilled eggs, oysters, scallop ceviche and shell pasta with pulled pork and habanero pesto. No room for desserts!
5
The Mangalican Pork, Kobe Beef, Clam Soup and Octopus Risotto were just awesome! And the cocktail drinks concoctions were fabulous...and strong.
5
Not our first time at this restaurant, we love the food. A table of 4, we ordered every single dish on the menu and were not dissapoimted. The orecchiette with pulled pork and sour cream is wonderful, so are the cocktails. We will be back soon
4
The 4 of us had a ball. Great menu and as we couldn't decided which ones to restrict ourselves to we simply ordered 1 plate of every dish on the menu. That was 4 each and we tasted everything. the items that stood out were: Hokkaido scallop ceviche; grilled eryngii mushrooms ( to die for); cathc of the day baramundi; the black angus; the wagyu beef sooo tender; the grilled Hungarian pork. For afters we had grilled camembert with a divine crumble, cheese plate and the best Tiramisu I have in Singapore. We tried the cocktails and my favourite was the rhubarb elderflower gin fizz closely followed by the scrumptious brown butter old fashioned. Try all of this with the Lealtanza Reserva rijoa which is a really lovely wine and if you want splurge try the Manara Valpollicella with your desserts. Having tasted everything I will be back to have seconds of my favourites

Cozy little place with quirky decor. We were a group of six, and had the omakase dinner. It was nice to just sit back and wait for the tasty morsels to be served, and be pleasantly surprised. For the six of us, there were about 18 plates! My favorites were the scallop ceviche, squid ink risotto (with salted egg sauce!), pulled-pork shell pasta, grilled tiger prawns, wagyu beef.. The cheese that topped the zucchini pancake was too strong for my taste, but my friends loved it, so... It was fun trying to identify the ingredients and spices used
3
Very authentic in that their portions are morsel-sized. Ordered 6 dishes a la carte between two of us and did not go into food coma. Taste-wise they fared above average but we weren't bowled over not least because of the price point...Their omakase menu, which is the reason we were there in the first place happened to be unavailable because of the World Gourmet Summit, but is possibly more bang for your buck and worth a try, I've been told.More tasty are the short ribs and deviled eggs out of the 6 plates sampled. Not sure I'd go back

I always have a thing for small & quaint establishments who show so much passion is everything that they do and put their hearts in every dish that they cook.Morsels is one of my soft spots I always go to for awesome small plates that keeps me & my company of the night more than just satisfied.They do so much in-house infusing and preserving of ingredients which are being used for a lot of their dishes. Many when put together....might set you wondering what to expect when you read it on the menu. But when tasted, wow wow wowwwww....amazing flavours.I love how much creativity is shown in every dish and they are all well-executed. My personal favorites? The little neck clams with miso broth and homemade kim chi, and squid ink risotto. Look out for the little details that made all these regular sounding dishes, more than just amazing.I came for the WGS 2016 Omakase menu and was once again deeply impressed. The grilled tiger prawns that came with the smoked strawberries gazpacho was such a beautiful dish.....who would have thought??Thank you for a good time!

Great food- delicious combination of ingredients and an interesting menu. The memorable dishes are the scallop ceviche, beef short rib, zucchini pancakes and octopus risotto. I wish I had ordered the clams instead of the mushrooms. The menu recommends 6 dishes but it's 1 too many for 2 people. The food is great but I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because the ambience is a no-mans land- it's neither chic, rustic or hipster. The kitchen is anything but a show and hearing snippets of how they've run out of a certain ingredient or something had been cooked the wrong way.

My friend booked dinner at this restaurant which she recommended and is a regular there. I absolutely loved the relaxed atmosphere and the quirky interior designs which is prevalent in the restaurant. The restaurant is situated in a pre-war Chinese colonial style shophouse and I was very impressed that the owners kept all the original structures and some cool antique furniture.My friend ordered a number of items from the menu for sharing between 6 of us. My favorite dishes were the pulled pork pasta, squid ink risotto with salted egg sauce and the grilled tiger prawns.The desserts especially the milo tiramisu was delicious!I had an amazing time at Morsels and would certainly return
4
Morsels is tucked away in Mayo Street and has a cosy, informal atmosphere with rustic style that's ideal for a relaxed evening. We went there on a Friday night and it was reasonably populated but not full.The menu is based on small plates which is great for those of us who like to try lots of different things. All our dishes were very good but the scallop ceviche was excellent.Overall a very nice meal and I would certainly recommend it
5
Had a great time at Morsels. For casual dining with food and drinks that surprise you, this is the place!
4
Love every dish that we ordered. Love the atmosphere and ambience. Good service. Only concern is the car park.
5
Every dish we had was wiped cleaned, that speaks alot about the food at Morsels. Love the space and decor. Its a great place to hang out ovee a good meal.
5
Inventive cuisine in a friendly environment. Come here for perfectly executed fusion food. Attention to detail and excellently sourced raw ingredients all lead to a fabulous dinner
4
2nd time here. Nice, chill space. Earnest team who have decent food and a great love for cooking. Loads of potential here. Be warned...parking is a pain. So cab it or park at the nearby The Verve.
4
This is a lovely rustic restaurant where you can go of an evening to relax. No need to dress up. The food however is significantly better than you would expect of the setting. We chose 5 dishes between the two of us which was more than enough. I particularly enjoyed the Scallop Ceviche.Service was excellent - we shall definitely be back for more
3
This review is a little late but back in April when i went, i was served by a male part timer. Looks pretty young. I was very impressed as he could remember all the ingredients and the way its being cooked very well. Hard to find in the industry these days. I forgot his name but i hope he's still there. Maybe because it was empty when i went. Food didn't leave a big impression on me tho. I hope their doing more exciting stuff!

This is a small little restaurant in Little India, with only 2 chefs. The food is meant for sharing, and we shared 6 plates between the 2 of us. The momotoro gazpacho was divine - probably the best gazpacho I have ever had. The venus clams with a touch of home made kimchi were fresh and meaty, came with the most wonderfully buttery broth - I almost licked the bottom the bowl to finish it. The octopus risotto was rich - but nicely so, and the octopus had that beautiful roasted taste, which was a great counterpoint to the rich risotto. The tiger prawns in a mentaiko capellini was also beautifully done. The lamb riblets were soft, but wasn't a standout - but that was because the previous dishes had set the bar so high.There are only 2 desserts, we tried the milo tiramisu - and it was great - just beware its a little strong - the small portion is plenty for 2 people.This is fine dining in a casual restaurant, in a very interesting neighbourhood in Singapore.In summary, great cooking from 2 chefs who obviously have a lot of love and passion for their food. Definitely a must visit

Food was generally v good. We tried the 6 course Chef's recommendations.the starter Hokkaido scallops were a bit off, too gooey raw for my liking and tasted a bit too fishy. The Pulled Pork Conchiglie pasta with pesto was AMAZING. Would come back just for that! Squid ink risotto and Pork Ribs were pretty good too. Could do with a better dessert selection though. The only down side was the service. Severely understaffed and the chap didn't seem to understand our orders. Was a bad start to an otherwise good dinner. They will need to hire better waitstaff if they want to keep the dining experience top notch. Understandably hiring (good) staff now is a challenge in Singapore :
4
Been seen a lot of chatter on the rising star of the chef behind this establishment by the food press and bloggers. It did not disappoint, we chose a selection of five dishes to try: scallop cappuccio, clams, mushroom with egg, smoked lamb ribs and pulled pork.The pulled pork was my favourite but the dishes were all well presented and tasted unique. The ingredients were all fresh and tasty. Craft beer and homemade infused liquor is also available
1
The worst dining experience in Singapore. Expensive. Indifferent waitstaff. Nothing new. Don't bother. They don't care. Oh wait. It's called morsel. That is all they serve if you are lucky. Really lucky.
5
i always enjoyed my time having dinner in morsel.
my fave will be tuna tartare, clams and their milomisu which were amazing.
and if you like something unique for ur drink, try their tom yum vodka .
4
Went for late dinner and ambience was not bad ... Not buzzing but with a good crowd. It was refreshing to see a young couple being both the chef and owners of the place. You can tell they have passion in what they do.Interesting menu with a twist. The scallops carpaccio was good but not the best i've had. Mote flavours could have been married in the dish. However, the tiger prawns and braised beef was amazing. I love how the puree sweet potato complement with the sauce from the beef. Wished we ordered the bigger portion!The wine list is one of the best in town, given the quality and value of wine. I especially fell in love with the drylands sau blanc! Definitely one of the more interesting eats in singapore. Good for people who love to try various dishes.

After visiting Antidote, Artichoke, Dibs and Saha, I finished my Rising Chef of the Year Tour in Morsels. Therefore, I already visited the restaurants with the five most promising Chef in Singapore and, honestly, I was not disappointed... at all!I visited Morsels on a Friday to try lunch, actually, the only day of the week when they open for lunch. They have a different set lunch every Friday, for just 26++. The one I enjoyed was not only delicious, but also quite consistent. The Trio of Pea Soup was so nice that I could drink liters of it! Then, for the main, I chose the roasted lamb with rice, what actually was a very good choice. The Milo Tiramisu, signature dessert, was a very interesting twist to a classic tiramisu, expanding its usual flavour until unsuspected limits. I also tried the handmade soda, another special treat in this absolutely special place.Petrina and Bryan, owners and chefs of the restaurant, are not only two real good chefs, but also a very nice couple. You can feel the passion in their words, and how they succeed putting this same passion to their dishes.So, who should be the rising chef of the year? After visiting Antidote, Artichoke, Dibs, Saha and Morsels, my only thought is that doesn't really matters: they all are winners. And, the best of it, Singapore is the real winner, having the chance to host these amazing chefs. You don't need to go to the exclusive restaurants to delight yourself with an unforgettable dinner. Here there are five choices where you can fill your belly, your senses and your expectations. This is the kind of places that we should promote among our friends: with unpretentious, humble and hugely talented young chefs on the stoves. Go to Antidote, Artichoke, Dibs, Morsels and Saha is helping them and helping us

I came to this place for dinner with a group of 16 friends. They allowed BYO which was great. The ambience is relaxes hut stylish and the food was very good especially the raw scallops, ragu and the beef rib. The service was very good and attentive and it was great be sat next to the open kitchen. The brigade were cool, calm and collected and a pleasure to watch
4
Had dinner there in late February and the food was a welcomed changed from the Chinese New Year Dining. Interesting experimental sauces and combinations of Asian and Western ingredients. 4 of us went through about 10 dishes. Some dishes had so many ingredients I couldn't pick out the key flavors.The ambience and dÃ©cor was casual and relaxing. My favorite dishes were the scallop carpaccio and miso tiramisu. All in, a very pleasant dining experience
5
Morsels is that rare find in Singapore: an atmospheric location in Little India down a side street oozing with character from old, un-gentrified buildings. And once you step inside, the character changes into an informal yet buttoned up establishment with the kind of artful interior decor that takes ordinary objects like cheese graters and turns them into sparkling lamps. The service was friendly and knowledgeable and warm --- genuinely so. The food was sharing plates. We had beef ribs with meat so tender that it fell off the bone; Hungarian pork with a cauliflower mash; liver mousse that had us scraping the small dish for more; beef tongue carpaccio. I'm not a fan of beef tongue --- my wife is --- but this time was different. On a Wednesday night there was a good crowd; animated discussions; a great buzz. The music enhanced but didn't drown out the conversation. We were in Singapore with the vibe similar to a restaurant off Union Square in San Francisco. It was a great evening

Fusion cuisine in a relaxed ambience with trendy, funky decor. What I liked most is that the fusion cuisine "worked" - the flavours did indeed "fuse" or blend, unlike some places where chefs try to be too creative and where in fact the cuisine no longer fuses but clashes! Morsels us designed for sharing. Servings are for 2 and ordering around 6 dishes in total is ample- besides dessert of course!! The pulled pork dish is fab - tender, delicious and tasty and was our favorite. Both pork dishes in fact - the firecracker and also the mangalica dish were a YES! Next was the octopus and squid in risotto with a salted egg sauce - very more-ish! Grilled shrimps do not stand out from other eateries but weren't disappointing and if you like lamb ribs a little more on the fatty side, you won't be disappointed here. This latter dish was our least favorite (and also the most extensive at 32SGD) . Nice tiramisu and pannacotta and also lovely red wine on special - Erse - from Sicily. A lovely evening which I'm bound to repeat although it's not inexpensive so perhaps a more special occasion again

We were the first diners in the restaurant and was seated right front of the chefs at the counter. There was not a single greeting nor even an attempt by anyone of the 4 chefs who were right in front of us to say a word of hello. They seemed busy occupied busy looking at the owner chef preparing some dishes for some invisible guests. The chefs went about preparing the food as if they are beginners in some elementary cooking class. It took them more 30 mins to serve the first dish of the day to us! Despite being the only diners at the restaurant at that time. The food was average. Be prepared to feel unwelcome at this restaurant! The owner chef definitely lacks the EQ to know that the experience in any restaurant is not just about the food, but the overall experience of feeling welcome
1
We did complain to the restaurant but their response was so disappointing that this review is the result.And if they were only a month or two old, you might give them the benefit of the doubt. But no. This restaurant has been operating for too long to fail this badly.We were a table of 8. Main courses were served with at least a half hour gap between each diner - even those who ordered the same dish. Two people were served their courses, half an hour later or more two more were served, then another gap and two more were served. White wine was served at room temperature. No apologies. No attempts to resolve the situation. I suspect they just wanted us to go away. I can't recommend this place
4
the food was brilliantly good. great atmosphere for a date or intimate catch-up with friends. the only downside is location i'd say.
5
This hideaway is definitely off the beaten path but is worth the search. The menu features really clever small plates executed to perfection. A personal favourite is the zucchini pancake with bleu cheese and miso honey. It looks like pancakes with butter and syrup, but tastes savoury and delicious! It has a quirky, warm vibe and nicely stocked artisanal bar, but the food steals the show!  
5
Grab a seat at the kitchen counter and chill with Bryan and Petrina as they work their magic on deliciously inventive dishes. Every item is made from scratch, and the food is as edgy as the Little India backstreet location. From the chefs' eclectically hand picked California decor to Petrina's carefully choreographed presentation in every dish, attention to detail and creativity are what set Morsels apart. Clams in a savory kimchi broth, Japanese eringi mushrooms served with poached egg, and hamachi with a house-made yuzu vinaigrette is just a sampling of what's in store. Frequent specials makes for very tough decision-making. Just order a bottle of wine, go omakase, sit back...and enjoy the show

Very nice cold cut platter, serve with bread, and I like the aromas of the bread!! Beef tongue are very creative, this is call real fusian food, with some Chinese style dressing. Hot olive, first experience to me, olive is very western, but Chinese always eat hot food, so I believe it maybe a idea of fusian olive~Really love the mushroom!! I will said is a must try dish if you are mushroom lover!!Scallop is good, a bit fishy, taste like oyster something...but still good to try.. Only a fish with white snow fungus & vegetable wasn't my favor..hmm...maybe good for people who like vegetable. Clam is very good, innovative base with kimchi inside, just the portion are too small, a bit pricy...Saw the review of milo Tira miso, was a bit disappointed... The ladies finger is over soak, very soggy....Overall is still a good experience !

Less than a minute from our hotel on Perak Road we stumbled across Morsels and dined there our second to last night. It was PHENOMENAL! We got three dishes - including the most tender short ribs we've ever eaten - fresh juices and cocktails and were treated to a complimentary glass each of a Californian red and it came to less than AUD$120.The service was impeccable, the food five star quality and the ambience casual and chic. They should be busier! Highly recommend

For full reviews, visit my site at ms-skinnyfatIt was a tapas calling recently and i suggested a gathering at Morsels, a blink-and-you'll-miss-it eatery tucked away in a shop house along Mayo Street. In fact, you wouldn't even know it's there because no one would randomly walk past this spot in Little India. Morsels serves morsels of food (really small plates) that are largely influenced by Japanese ingredients but it also incorporates a variety of cultures in their dishes.Ingredients are sourced from local farmers and sustainable sources if you are big on that sorta stuff. Here's what we sampled.Must OrdersYou should definitely start with the Hokkaido Scallop Ceviche ($17/25). This is what spring/summer taste like. Cubes of tangy compressed seasonal plum, salty tobiko and sweet scallops were tossed with cilantro, onion and a refreshing yuzu. It's even more awesome with the homemade tortilla chips which is a cross between a super buttery curry puff pastry and wanton skin. Super love! We ordered a second portion immediately upon tasting this.If you do not wish to have morsels, then the following 3 mains should satisfy your tummy. Ume-sake Braised Short Rib ($30/38) was delectably tender and flavorful. Certainly umami. We especially enjoyed the Okinawan Sweet Potato mash that had a light sweetness to it and wasn't too starchy. Served with crunchy baby Bok Choy, Ume and koji wasabi. Another 2 portion dish!The Firecracker Pulled Pork Conchiglie Pasta ($16/24) was also voted as a top favorite with our group. There's something about the sourish and spicy habenero pesto sauce with the caramelized pulled pork. Neutralize the zing with the dollop of sour cream or just mix it all in. They could do with more meat though. Again, the boys demanded that we order another plate!The Grilled Hungarian Mangalican Pork ($28) wasn't too bad either. Mangalican Pork is really growing in popularity hur! The meat had a very clean un-porkish taste in fact and the cauliflower purée was a great healthy alternative to any cream sauce. We thought the Asian ginger sauce was just a regular BBQ sauce though.The other dishes varies from ok to not too fantastic. Steamed clams in fig broth ($22): OK but not quite worth the priceSquid ink Risotto ($25): Supposed to be a a signature dish too salty and lacking in squid ink flavors. Grilled octopus was good. Pan seared fish with buttermilk miso broth ($24): MEH. Too bland and not too fresh fish. Small portion.Hits and misses at Morsels. The group consensus was that we may come back for the top dishes instead of giving a go at all the funky morsels. We were at 70% stomach capacity at the end of the meal (probably less for the boys) and it was about $35/pax. You'd probably feel more satisfied if you stick to the bigger meals
5
Finding the restaurant was half the fun! Tucked between a mosque and backpacker hostels, Morsels is a small bistro in a shophouse in Little India. The vibe was friendly and warm, with an efficiently run restaurant feel to the place. The food was just superb. As some of the dishes come in small or regular sizes we opted to go for small and try more dishes which was great. Sit at the counter to watch the action and see a great team in harmony! Will be back in no time
5
Full disclosure. I was invited to dinner by Chefs-Owners Petrina and Bryan. I was blown away. Quaint space in a gritty neighbourhood, but I'll remember the compressed watermelon salad, the scallop and plum ceviche with homemade tortilla chips and the ume sake braised short rib on purple okinawan sweet potato for a long time … but what is indelibly etched in my mind was the pulled pork pasta with habanero pesto and sour cream, the grilled octopus on squid ink risotto with your special (and I mean special) preserved salty egg yolk (ham dan) sauce, and the seared red emperor snapper in miso buttermilk (another amazing “sauce” creation), and the roasted pork belly (Chinese-style) with the awesome pickled fennel. A wonderfully memorable meal

We stumbled across morsels restaurant, and how lucky we're we!!!! There was 3 of us, it was late'ish, and yet, the food and the service was excellent, no complaints at all. The menu got explained to us, we wee advised how many meals to partake between us, and it was the perfect amount, allowing room for dessert. We could not decide, so we all shared the panacotta and and the tira-miso. Blew our mind, we ALL decided it could quite possibly be the best thing we have ever eaten. We had been travelling Europe for 5 weeks, before our stop over in Singapore, and we all agreed, it was definitely THE BEST thing we had actually eaten on that trip to date!!!!!! My mouth still waters, we tried to get back there, too late one night, they were just closing and the day after that, we were heading home, so too early for them. Just gives me more of a reason to head back to Singapore!!!!!!!!! And to top it all of, we got to chat to the owner she was lovely, really lovely ( unfortunately he was busy cooking at the time), I had to comment to her, how they both looked relaxed, yet efficient and the food they delivered was cared for and loved. Well done to the Morsel team!!!!!!

Saw some review online somewhere else about this place. Ordered all the recommended item in the menu. Started with the hokkaido scallop with plum and tobiko, it has nice flavor and balance, thought the chips was over fried a bit. Next, was the clam in kimchi broth (this was the best of the night), nice balance of the sourness of the kimchi and flavor of the clam sweetened the chowder broth like. The Octopus and squid ink rissoto was ok, done right but taste was not there. The firecracker pasta with pulled pork, it needed more punch we thought. Was not filled up, so odered the porkbelly skewers, this was good. Last but not least was dessert, ordered dessert of the day, tiramiso with milo powder, was not a good ending. the combination of flavor, found it a bit unbalance, salty, sour and sweet not in a good way, hope they will improve it, the idea is cool, but just was not right on that day. Location is a bit out there, but there is potential
