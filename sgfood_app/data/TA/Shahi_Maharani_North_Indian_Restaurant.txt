Restaurant is not so expensive

Very well established and reputable North Indian Cuisine restaurant conveniently located in the heart of the city. Is a favorite for many years and the standard of the food is always good. Usual chicken tikka butter chicken prawn byrani never fails.

food is ok in taste.bit expensive but for dinner its ok to go once a while.service and atmoshere are very nice,
5
To start with.. I’m not really a fan of eating Indian food overseas specially because they can never get it right.. but this place got it bang on! Excellent food.. pick out anything from the buffet and you’ll be a happy customer.. highly recommend!

What do you need for a business lunch? Fast courteous service, no loud music and quality food ..this place has all three and is my go to place when my lunch group wants to try Indian. The buffet starts at 12 sharp and my practice is to be at the door by 11.55am. With some guests picking buffet and some ala carte it is all chop chop and we are always out of there before 1.45pm....having enjoyed appetizers, mains, desserts and chai. Curiously the tandoori chicken ala carte tastes better than the buffett...hmmmm....go figure ; )). In case you do not know their little secret on the "finisher" allow me to share. At the payment counter there is a silver spice box filled with cardamoms,sugared fennel seeds and an assortment of mouth fresheners called "suparis". They do not go all out to show you this....but do ask for it at the end of the meal. After a delicious lunch this may be the antidote to inevitable and unwanted sleepiness after a meal. Supari box...then back to office;))

I had a splendid time at Shahi Maharani. In my context I feel that this place is lush and posh.I had Chicken Makhanwala, Palak Paneer and Bengali Fish Curry with my Garlic and Butter naan. They are flavorful and delicious. I would prolly order 1 gravy dish in future. I had so much gravy that added complexity to the naan. LOL!As I was sitting at my table, I noticed a lot of hot plate being served out. And I was intrigued by the smell and flavour that I had to just ask the service crew what it was. Tandoori Paneer, the crew explained to me it's cottage cheese and peppers laced with a creamy marinade. The service was excellent n warming

We experienced dinner two nights ago. The service was good from the staff but the food quality did not match our expectations.The taste of the food was very average and nothing to warrant a repeat visit. Singapore does have a big selection fortunately of better taste restaurants

We used to live in Singapore in 2006 and this used to be one of our favorite places. After that whenever we come to Singapore - we make sure to visit the restaurant. Had a terrible experience today. Went there at 8:00pm for dinner, being new year’s eve they had a buffet menu. They had a early bird promotion of SGD 60 per person if you had food between 6:30-8:30. When we went there they said we can’t offer you early bird price anymore, we can offer you the table at normal price. We said that’s fine then Binay said I don’t have a table and the restaurant was half empty which was quiet strange.... we will neither visit this place in the future nor recommend it anymore
4
The food and ambience was very good. I especially liked the live Indian music. Service was attentive and accurate. The restaurant was a bit pricy. With wine the bill came to $500 for 6 pax. Worth a try but you won’t risk getting fat on the prices.
3
We were at this place for dinner. Good ambience but a bit slow service. Could see lot foreigners who were interested in Indian food and that is a good thing. They had quite a good variety of food on the menu and tasted well too just that it did not suit me for whatever reason and ended up with stomach issues the next day. So due to personal experience I will not be visiting again, to the rest good luck
4
Shahi Maharani as indicated is a North Indian cuisine restaurant! Good food with a great ambience! Truly a royal experience! And you have to pay for it! Service is good! Food taste is also good! Nice option for groups and big families!
4
Wide variety of Indian food options to choose for. We were looking for quality veg dinner and found this place to be perfect. Ambiance is decent, service is on time, food was really well prepared. Vegetable sizzler we ordered tasted amazing!
5
We have visited Shahi Maharani, multiple times. Very few Restaurants in Singapore have a good combination of authentic Indian Taste, Great Ambience and amazing service. Worth mention..Sanjay and Vinay...Great attitude and customer focus is sincerely appreciated.Must visit for every Indian.location is ++
4
Very nice food , my favorite was butter chicken and my daughter enjoyed Pani puri .
Overall good experience , definitely recommend to go.
4
Really enjoyed the food here. Came here based on a friend recommendation and did not disappoint! Food was excellent. Only thing is the staff kept on interrupting our conversations, slightly annoying
5
Butter chicken and tikka masala were both very tasty. You can see through a window, how the chef prepares the dishes. Everything freshly prepared.
The pricing is high - but reasonable. The quality of the food and service was outstanding.
4
This restaurant in Raffles city Mall offers great north Indian food.The ambience is good and the service is also good.The prices are steep but it is worth .If you want good north Indian food while in Singapore this is the right place to go to.
5
Our first day at Singapore and we decided to have dinner in this restaurant as we were staying in Swissotel. Good choice by us, food was good so were the staff and their hospitality. lot of variety available. Unfortunately the food didn't suit me so was skeptical to make a visit again, though my other 2 friends enjoyed it. You get papdams as complimentary. We tried the papdi chaat, dahi bhalla, chole , roti & mixed veggie. Kudos to the team. Keep up the good work
5
For someone who can afford the best price this is the place not to be missed. Took my family and brother's family on a special occasion, every single member of the 8 member gang enjoyed from 3 years to 48 years range. Taste is awesome, quality is the best. At least once you should visit though the bill will make a hole in your wallet but for the food they provide its expected you can't complain!

This restaurant is in raffles city shopping centre.Indian food fine dining kind of arrangement . Expensive I would say for the food and for the ambiance.They do have 1 for 1 buffet on weekdays but you can also order ala carte.Service is good , food taste good too.But there are better Indian restaurants in Singapore if you are looking for much tastier Indian food.
4
Ambiance was good. Service is good. About the Buffet; Starters were great, Chat counter is awesome, Mains are average, not much choice for vegetarians and Desert is also average except for Gulab Jamuns which were mouth watering.
4
I think they have lost their exclusivity in serving authentic taste, food was average, but expensive Located in Raffles City mall.
5
Shahi Maharani has a great ambiance, and offer buffet and ala carte options. Amazing indian food in Singapore, along with Chat options, and soulful live music during weekends / PHs. Please make an advnace booking, as this is in great demand due to its central location. for us choices were limited due to Jain food, but had some amazing options and great taste. Staff is very friendly
4
My Indian brought me to this place, and I have brought my families here many times.There are many options for vegetarian. We love the black dhal, cottage cheese in spinach, the mashed eggplants and the breads. We also love the thin bread, Roomali Roti. However, the serving size is smaller than other Indian restaurants, and prices are higher as well.

It was a girls' night out. My three friends and I met at the restaurant for dinner as I was craving a good curry. The restaurant did not disappoint. We were seated near the stage where the musicians would be playing. Thankfully, they were coming on at 9pm so we were able to finish dinner before enjoying authentic Indian music complete with vocals and instrumentation.The portions were just right for four women; with leftovers to be brought home. We ordered an appetizer that was recommended by the waiter, and had one order each of Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer (spinach cottage cheese), Aloo Gobi (spiced potatoes and cauliflower), Beef Rogan Josh (beef in masala spices), Saffron Rice and Naan roti (bread baked in a tandoori oven). We also ordered Raita (onions, cucumber in yoghurt).The food arrived within 10 minutes of our order and it was a feast for the eyes and palate. Compared to South Indian curries, this North Indian dinner was less spicy but flavourful nonetheless. For the uninitiated into Indian cuisine, this would have been a good place to start.We fought to foot the bill as each of us wanted to give the others a treat, amusing the waiter in the process. We were so stuffed from dinner that we skipped dessert. Kulfi (Indian Ice cream) would have been my choice.Since it was a Sunday evening, the restaurant was not packed. Otherwise, a reservation is required on Saturdays
5
My favourite cuisine is Northern Indian ! I would say the lunch special was worth every cent , arrived at 12 noon, my friend and I enjoyed eating from 12 till 2.30 .The cost was such a surprise when we went to pay $50 all you can eat , 2 people eat for one price , we enjoyed a cold beer $14. The service charge and GST was included , total of bill$91.80 , will definitely be coming back Thankyou, oh I forgot to mention the food it was of very high quality the produce and flavour was beautiful
5
Its an excellent restaurant and provide nice buffet. They had 1 to 1 offer and had sumptuous lunch. 1. Food: justDelicious. Buffet is one the best. A lot for varieties. 2. Service: Excellent. 3 Ambience: Good. They do have live music at times. 4. Price: $50++ for couple on weekdays

Hi,We recently visited this restaurant along with our project team, management team and vendor. We have been served with some delicious mouth watering starters and Indian food both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.They have 63 $ fixed buffet menu per person which comes with starters, main course and deserts. Although quantity is high taste is very good.The only concern is very high price but it is compensated by ambiance and service.Hope that helps.RegardsAja
4
Good choice of food. This was our first taste of North Indian cuisine. We chose a prawn curry with coconut and a chicken curry. One serving of rice was sufficient for both of us. We both thoroughly enjoyed the curries even though neither could finish as the portion was very generous. The staff were helpful and friendly and the live music a bonus. Very haunting singing. As with the whole of Singapore, remember your final bill will include tax and service charge

If you are looking at fine dining for Indian food, this is a good place. I had no complaints on the food! It was yummy and the portions were really good as well. Located in Raffles City mall, it is surely easy access and in the centre of the city. That said, the ambiance is quite dull and not that invested in. So apart from the food and good company (which I hope you have!) there is not much to enjoy here. I am a sucker for good ambiance so it was a disappointment for me. Food is pricey here. So not an everyday place. There was live music on the 2 days that I had been here. One day the music was good, and it wasn't that great on the other day. So that would be an average rating for the music
4
Excellent food and authentic Indian taste. Had the lunch buffet.
However, was a little disappointed to not find Jalebi in the dessert menu even though the buffet advertised Jalebi.
5
A must go place for Indians. The ambience with the live music with Table all together is a most delightful place to be in again and again. Price is little on a higher side. But that can be negligible sometimes.
5
We were about 8 people for dinner to this place in Raffles City Mall and had ordered ala carte vegetarian dishes and 1 non-veg dish. Have to say that the food was simply superb and can say one of the best in S'pore. Have been there before but this was definitely the best experience. Also there was some really good music in the form of ghazals and songs which also made the atmosphere around wonderful. Last I came here was for a buffet dinner. So had dinner here after a very long time. My last experience about 8 years back had also been very good. The decor as usual is also very good. This place even though it's a bit expensive, but its absolutely recommended for authentic Indian cuisine and it's real flavours.. Overall an amazing evenin

As a lover of authentic Indian food, when in Singapore, as I was earlier this week, I always include a great Indian meal in my Agenda. And this restaurant is my all-time favourite. I have been following them around Singapore from their early days when they were located in Far East Plaza and, over the years, their food has remained consistent and consistently excellent. This is truly authentic Indian food, not the “Western” interpretation thereupon, tailored to the Western palate, which are so common these days.My recent visit for dinner did not disappoint and I can still recommend it to the lover of authentic Indian food without hesitation.My only small gripe is that, I guess in response to its popularity, the prices have become very high (On a par with Western Fine Dining establishments and, as much as I love Indian food, it just doesn’t command Fine Dining priices) so it no longer represents the compelling value for money that it used to represent. The price levels are now at or above London prices for si,ilar food.Also, and II know that this it is largely not their fault but a result of Government taxation policy, the cost of a glass of wonderfully chilled draft Tiger beer is extremely high
4
This is one of my favorite place to go for all those special and non special occasions. Lunch buffet will never disappoint you. Their naans are one of the best here. Gazals on weekends are too good especially if you have little ones whom you want to keep entertained. In last 5 years, I have visited them many times and I was never disappointed untill recently tried these - Hariyali murgi, vegetable jaipuri. These were tasteless, uncooked. I hope they improve on these dishes. Nevertheless I still recommend this place to everyone
4
in all respects (except the biryani), and the 50++ 1for1 (= for two) is adequate (it seems to be a permanent promo; for 1 this would not be appropriate). It's a nice, well-decorated place, and the price, well, you pay for this and you know it, in London the price would be double. And of course you get the slightly unpleasant larger parties of people who... buy and sell things I guess? FinBusiness? Restaurants like these live from them, so there goes. Still a pleasant atmosphere.What I then mind is the lower-end setup within the high-end context: One paper napkin (ok this is napkin-hell Singapore, but come on!), cutlery not replaced for new rounds, and glass table tops that are CLEANED WITH WINDEX next to tables where people eat. I mean, really
5
Have patronized this place over the years and it offers tasty food and a great ambience. The service is warm and outstanding. Staff make an effort to recognize regulars and welcome new patrons warmly. Grear ecperience for formal and family meals. Staff are ready to customize according taste where possible. Luv this place
4
We went for dinner and had some superb north Indian food while listening to live music. Their chicken korma is one of the best I've had so far and it's flavoured with nuts which makes the taste mindblowing. The waiters were attentive and great at recommending dishes including cautioning us when we are on the verge of over-ordering (always happens when you get to a restaurant starving)
5
Quality of dishes we ordered were the best we have experienced in Singapore for North India food. Butter Chicken was very close to what we get in Delhi with its tomato based gravy and its texture close to original. Kabuli Chole (Chick Peas curry) was also very good and had good mix of Indian spices cooked to perfection. The Paneer Makhani (cottage cheese) was also very good.Service was also very prompt despite being a Sunday afternoon (probably due to many guests opting for buffet).Atmosphere was good but the live band (for light indian music) place was shut (maybe they operate on weekdays only).Nothing much to complain about except that the place is a bit pricey but this was compensated with the good quality of food.Overall it was money well spent.I have tried all the top tier North Indian places in Singapore and this one stands out when it comes to food quality
5
Had lunch with the family and clearly this is one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. North Indian buffet restaurants always overwhelm you with a number of dishes. In our greed to try every possible dish, we end up over eating. Shahi Maharani's choice of dishes was perfect - not too many and not too few! Ambience was great as well. We will be back again
4
A little bit expensive but food quality is equally good. Every evening they have live band where you can give choice for your songs. Both singers are very good in all kind of music
5
Buffet menu during lunch provides rich variety of North Indian food, very delicious. Suitable for vegetarians and halal.
4
My friends & family had a great time celebrating an Occassion. Food was really finger licking & Most of theMusic was very Romantic! We Love this Place & are going again this Saturday .This time for our Anniversary. Perfect Combination.- Manu & Rina Chugani
4
We celebrated a birthday and booked ahead requesting Lamb Korma, which wasn't on the menu. Shahi Maharani. accommodated us with the lamb korma and it was delicious, much better than most of the numerous other Indian restaurants in Singapore.Shahi Maharani. is located on the 3rd floor og a lively shopping mall in an excellent shopping mall, was easy dining with great shopping afterwards was a nice touch to finish off our celebrating birthday.If you like Indian food, the Shahi Maharani. is a must visit to dine
3
Been to this place multiple times, can see the service standards & food choices going south very faster... 1. During buffet it's very important to clear the table, Most of the staff don't pay attention and even when asked they don't clear all the plates. 2. Chat servicing was one of your top item and was very good earlier during my visit 2 months back, This time around it was taste less especially the Pani. 3. Service staff: Clearly needs to be improved to serve better
5
It's a lovely place for Indian Fine dining. Price don't come cheap, however the food quality is worth every penny.Though I have forgotten the name of the boneless mutton dish thats on the menu, its taste is not unforgetable. I am still able to taste the juicyness of the meat and the flavourful spices that's surrounding the meat.It will be endless if I were to continue with the praises. So, please visit this restaurant to have the first hand experience of my rave
4
After alighting from the Singapore flyer ride, I along with my family visited this Indian restaurant, which is located in the same building. It was lunch time and the full fledged Indian buffet was on, which had a good number of both Vegetarian and Non vegetarian dishes, rice, assorted breads and sweets.Despite being a bit crowded, the female waitresses were able to manage the show pretty well. Its a large hall and ample seating capacity, the decor was ok, could have been better. But overall a good restaurant
3
I booked Shahi Maharani to celebrate my mother's birthday and had called in to request them for a good table (for three of us). When we reached there, we were ushered to a most non-discrete table on the floor. I know there is no so called 'good table' but would have preferred anywhere other than where we were. It was neither in the centre, nor at the corner. Nonetheless, that didn't cut a point from my rating. Food was fine so we enjoyed it. As there was live singing ongoing, we made requests for two songs but none were played and we assumed that may be there are many in the queue and that didn't cut a point from my rating. However, during our dinner, a group of people came to the restaurant which was quite loud and since then it became very difficult to gain attention from any staff member. The group requested for songs and their requests were immediately taken care of. And then, this place became the first restaurant in Singapore where I went for a birthday dinner with advance notice and not even a lighter was brought to the table. I do not know if the person taking booking messed up or if people in that group were very important or regulars, but overall, the service left a bad taste in my mouth
5
On a recent visit to Singapore this year, my colleague and I decided to eat at Maharani. I had eaten at this restaurant before (approximately 3 years ago) and as I enjoyed it the last time I recommended going here. I was hoping it wouldn’t let me down.The Food:I ordered a starter of papdi chaat and a main of kabuli chana and garlic naan. We also had popadoms but these were complimentary as too were the chutneys. My colleague ordered fried okra for starters and a vindaloo dish for mains. The starters were fantastic. The fried okra was crispy and light. The papdi chaat was creamy, tangy and flavourful. The small fried breads were crispy and the whole dish was very well balanced. The mains of kabuli chana and garlic naan were truly amazing. I requested the dish to be made spicier and the chef got it spot on. This is the only place in the world that I have eaten at, for which I can say beats my mother’s kabuli chana. I definitely was not disappointed with the food. The taste was amazing as it was three years ago. I am very fussy about my popadoms and restaurant popadoms are generally something that I avoid. These popadoms were not too bad as the chef had cooked them slightly over to give it some colour and a smoky flavour. My colleague mentioned that the vindaloo (with jeera rice) was very nice although a little bit on the spicier side. Service:The service was great. The waitress was very attentive and did not use a notepad to take our order which is always a nice touch. This place positions itself towards the top end of the restaurant market (generally I found Singapore an expensive place for food) and therefore was expecting the service to be excellent and I had no complaints.Cleanliness:The restaurant was very clean. There were no issues with hygiene.Ambience:The ambience was excellent. The restaurant has a welcoming feel to it with two large doors with wooden carvings and a statue of Ganesh in full view. The décor is feels like it is a banqueting suite of a palace in Rajasthan. The spacing of the tables gives an uncluttered feel and Rajasthani pictures and portraits on the wall give the restaurant its identity. The star of the show in terms of ambience, which I have left till last, is that there is live singing and music. The singers are also very good and they also take requests from the audience. Price: Restaurants in Singapore are expensive and there are no cheap eats definitely not at dinner time. My colleague and I paid a Queenly sum (the name of the restaurant translated into English is Royal Queen). The food and service were excellent was so the price felt justified from this perspective but make no mistake it is expensive. As the restaurant is attached to a shopping mall and two hotels (The Fairmont Singapore and the Swissotel), there will be a premium price. Overall:I am so glad and so relieved that this restaurant lived up to my expectations of three years ago and my recommendation to eat here did not let me down. This is a definitely a restaurant I would recommend if one wants to eat Indian cuisine in Singapore. If visiting again then I would definitely go again, the price is steep but so is elsewhere in Singapore for cuisine of this calibre. One thing is for certain I won’t be disappointed. A full five stars, for this visit and also my visit of 3 years ago

We booked the private room for our daughter's first year birthday. Food was excellent and service was very good. The waiter was also very friendly with our child who was getting bored of sitting in the high chair while the adults were eating. Chicken handi dish was not good and sheekh kebab a little dry but the other items were good-tandoori chicken, mutton vindaloo, yellow and maharani dhal, chicken and mutton briyani. We always come back here for our events and catering and will continue to do so
4
Authentic Indian fare. The Papdi Chaat as entrée is really really good. Service was excellent and the bill quite in line with the level of service and standard of food.
4
The cosy boothseats are great for catching up with a friend over a good meal. Their specialty grilled tiger prawns is a must-have! Service staff were helpful & attentive. And the live Indian music is a nice touch!
3
The buffet is average pricing but some part is ok . The main course is like average . Starters makes it feel different . Good ambience and general authentic Indian cuisine
4
If you are looking for an authentic Indian restaurant for special occasions like anniversaries / birthdays, etc Shahi Maharani could be your best bet.
5
Had a great afternoon at Shahi Maharani. Service is great, interior is beautiful, and the food was delicious. Will definitely be back!
4
Visited shahi maharani for dinner. Very tasty galauti kebabs and good food. Good portions of food, made in rich aromatic Indian style. The ambience was consciously loud, with a live band singing old hindi songs... Worth a trip.
4
Went there after a long time and was not disappointed although not the best.There was weekday lunch buffet promotion for 50++ I believe and they had 1-1 meaning one of us ate free.Appetisers were ok nothing out of ur world, veg Pakoras were good, tomato pepper soup ok and Tandoori chicken was Cold.. I mean really cold.Chicken curry dish and dal was fine and they delivers fresh naan to your table.Dessert selection was disappointing, the so called Kheer (Rice and Milk pudding) was neither chilled Nor hot and halwa was average.They had coconut ladoos which was horrible.Probably main course saved the day as they were delicious and fresh
4
We ordered vegetarian samosas, malai kofta curry, dhal maharani, biryani rice and naan for 4 persons. It was all really good. Quite spicy. So tell them if you don't want to spicy food.The waiters are friendly. The restaurant is big and there is a good atmosphere. There was life music when we were there.It is more expensive then most Indian restaurants but the food and service are so good that it is worth it
4
I called here so that I could brief my colleague with whom I was working in Singapore. There was music paying and that made it difficult to talk business. However, the atmosphere was good and the service was excellent. The menu like quite exciting and there was plenty of choice. I made a mistake by ordering samosa for starters. The two samosa I received were huge and I could not finish them. That made it difficult for me to eat the main dish, which was extremely tasty. It was quite expensive and my colleague found that there were too few vegetarian dishes for his liking, although he had been there before
4
Went in this restaurant for a quiet dinner. Considering there were not many descent looking halal restaurants in The Raffles shopping center and that a number of the guest only eat Halal, it was only appropriate we chose this restaurant.The service was very fast and that we were ushered to our table rather quick. We had a number of discuses ranging from Palak Paneer, Lamb Karahi, Naan, biryani and several other dishes. In general, the portions were of good size and the dishes were tasty. They were not too spicy and far from blend. None of us complaint of the taste and that of the service.The restaurant is set with the furnishing and the decor of the northern Indian styling. The kitchen can be visible and they have a see through window where the tandoori was being barbecued... I think. Live music was present and the trio who played the instruments were quite good. The overall experience at this restaurant was rather nice and with the kulfi desert, it ended with a good note. I did not get the bill and therefore I cannot comment if this was value for money. I suspect that it may be slightly pricey than the usual North Indian restaurant, but with the ambiance and environment of such a lovely restaurant, it is probably worth it
5
The food is excellent. Loved their kababs though a little spicy and the chaat dishes in the buffet spread.
An excellent place for leisurely lunch with family and friends.
4
We always love to have chats and samosas there. The male singer is very good and Sings beautiful Jagjit Singh gazzals. The serving size is good too.
4
Located at Raffles City shopping centre, this restaurant provides very good Indian food. Ambience was nice. We had corporate buffet and every dish was good. recommended if u want to have Indian food
4
Hey good experience to dine with live Hindi music. But the place is tad costly so choose the place according to your budget.
5
The food and the ambience was really amazing.. We continously had our dinner there for 2 days..and was really happy with the food quality and quantity.. The live song adds more excitement to our dinner.. A different experience..!!
4
I have been to this restaurant a few times now and I have not been disappointed even once. The decor is a bit too heavy for me and the lighting a bit dark to my taste. Often gives a feeling of being in an old Delhi restaurant. More so when you get seated in the well cushioned sofas on the side!Spread offered as lunch buffet is quite good - even for a vegetarian. Starters are quite good and consistently good main course. Dessert is a let off.Even after an one-for-one offer, at 50++, an average vegetarian would find it difficult to get good value unless you have a non vegetarian sharing the offer.Having said that, I would still recommend this restaurant for its consistently good quality of food.
4
One of the closest place to my hotel. Used to dine here quite often. Best part was the live Hindi/ Indian music. Thought the singers are average- but it feels realy great to hear your songs abroad down town. Restaurnat had variety on menu and I coudn't try all of them.Crew was too nice and polite; very prompt in service. Special Thanks to their Lead- Mr Sumeet, who always paid personal attention on every visit.I remember my first visit when I was in hurry and I asked, if they would be able to serve me in next 15 minutes? Mr Sumeet said- tough, but we would to that. Amazingly the ordered food was served in 10 minutes and I was relieved after 20 minutes net.Only issue: food quantity served was always too mch to finish. :
5
It is a nice place for gathering. Light music plays from 8am. Hindi music is soothing and non intrusive although we sat beside the stage. The food is very tasty and the waitress who served us was very attentive. She even advised us on the portions and the dishes. The tandoor is s must have. They even got a candle on an Indian sweet dish when they found out that we were celebrating birthdays. The singers even sang a popular Hindi birthday song, substituting my friends' names.
5
My family and I had dinner on National Day just this Tuesday.We all enjoyed the food - Saffron Rice was cooked to perfection, light and fluffy.Everyone enjoyed the Tandoori Chicken. My mom said it was beautifully cooked as it was not dry. She has had Tandoori in other restaurants and most times, chicken was too dry and not juicy.Rogan Gosh, Bengali Fish Curry, Bhindi Masala were all good...Everyone liked the food and enjoyed eating.Service was very good. Staff were very attentive and always had smiles for us...It was nice to see people smiling gently.....created a beautiful ambiance and loving space for dining!I just have a suggestion - ordered masala tea after meal but didn't taste much spice in my tea..The tea was well made though...Oh yes, loved the papadum and pickles, mint chutney served when we were seated....Nice touch...Overall, we will definitely dine here again!So my family and I would like to extend our warm hearted thanks and gratitude to all restaurant staff on duty that evening! Many Blessings to All Who attended to us, and last but not least, the chef and kitchen staff
5
As you enter the restaurant you get the true enjoyment of Indian live music. The ambiance is very nice and touch to Indian concept. The staff greets you very well and serve the food very nicely. Come to main thing, Food and drinks... i can bet you can't have the Indian food like in here all around the Singapore. Its not very expensive and quantity is very sufficient for 4 people. Rest enjoy your dinner there
5
In the heart of Singapore at Raffles place is this food paradise located. Would recommend it to any foodie. Both the vegetarian n non vegetarian dishes are full of flavours n great taste. Plus they have a live gazal arena too.
5
One of the best Veg food i had in Singapore. Great atmosphere, fast service, taste was very great. Though rate wise on the high side, worth a try
4
This is a centrally located North Indian Restaurant with good food and a good ambience, specially suited for North Indians living in or visiting Singapore. It is worth a visit when in Singapore.
5
This place in Raffles city shopping centre is an excellent option for lovers of north Indian food.The ambience and service here is very good.The food was delicious and the portions were large. Definitely would recommend this place for good food lovers
5
This was one of the best North-Indian restaurants I have tried in Singapore.
The food was amazing, service at times was a tad slow and there's scope for improvement.
Go here for the Butter-Chicken if not anything!
5
We went here with friends and throughly enjoyed the experience . The food is delicious and the service is truly Impeccable . The cherry on the cake however is the live music ! The singers are soulful & melodious and bring an amazing energy into the room. Highly recommend for a good fine dining experience !

This restaurant is in Raffles city shopping center close to Fairmont hotel. As i love Indian food i just had to try this one and i was not disappointed. Friendly and helpfull staff was paying attention the whole time. Ordered few dishes and drinks and timing was perfect. The food was delicious, nice portions and price was reasonable. Place to come back if im in Singapore again

A friend and I wanted to enjoy some Indian food in Singapore. Attached to the Fairmont hotel, this restaurant can be a little hard to find, so ask for directions from the helpful hotel staff.Once there, we ordered three dishes along with rice and naan between the two of us, which turned out to be way too much food as the portions were very generous in size. We noticed many other tables had families or friends numbering six or more, so I would recommend this place for larger groups who can eat family style. Everything we tasted was delicious and if it were not for the countless other restaurants I want to try out in Singapore, I would come back here in a heartbeat

Went to shahi maharani on eve of Mother's Day. Food was not bad but the service was a let down when compared to the price we paid. Basically Waitresses were not in sync with each other. One said items are available while another said an item was not available but in the end all was available. Also they did not advise us if the tea comes in a small pot and is more than enough for 2 people. In the end we had 2 tea pots with half filled tea. Would really love if the waiter or waitress are interactive and take the effort to advise customers if they feel something is not right

Great to have an authentic Indian restaurant in the city with personnel who take pride in their recipes yet are humble and very service oriented!Paneer bhurji, dal maharani and bhindi masala are my favourite 
5
...restaurant in the world
Food is amazing.
There is nothing better than a fantastic Indian restaurant and Singapore has it. She they do not open a branch in Hk!
5
Visited this restaurant on the last day of my trip. They serve authentic Indian food, quantity is good. Nice ambience and lovely staff.
5
Loved loved loved the food here. Best to book. We dined a la carte but have heard the buffet is also great. We've travelled quite a lot and love Indian food - this was without doubt the best ever.
4
We had visited for my son's birthday for a buffet. The food was good, nice ambience. Worth the visit. It would be good if we have more veg options for the buffet.
5
My first indian buffet - which didn't sound very appealing at first but from the first bite to the last wipe of the plate with the garlic naan, it was mouth-watering, tasty and authentic. A definite must-return.
5
Had a lovely dinner. Great live music. Staff very polite and helpful. And the portions are huge. They serve authentic North Indian food. Would love to take my friend back there again!!!

located in city hall this north Indian restaurant with good ambience serves veg and non veg delicacies, the service is courteous and at times you can have lovely Bollywood music played by artists
5
You can order any Indian dish. Entertainment is also taken care singers have stock of old and new Hindi songs. The restaurant is located above city hall metro
4
Visited this Restaurant twice during our 3 day visit to Singapore. Excellent mouth watering food especially the lamb dishes. On our second visit we tried the vegetarian food and that was equally good. They also have live music and you can request your favourite Bollywood songs. Good service. Will definitely visit them again when in Singapor
5
The place is one of a kind for Indian food lovers. The ambiance is very nice and when we went for a dinner there was live Indian music which made us feel more of a home kind. The Vegetarian starters were mouth watering and yes after the starters we didn't had space for main course but still the cravings didn't leave us that easy so we ended up with main course too :D loved everything :) Will look forward for another visit soon

Shahi Maharani serves Very good Indian Food and is recommended to try. Though I found it slightly over-priced, the food is good. Huzayf
5
This restaurant has not disappointed me and has always kept to the wonderful delicious meals they have been offering. Their lunch buffet specialties are good value for money but please do have time to spare so that you do justice to their variety of offerings
3
Ambience and Service both are good. Food is good. Veg Biryani could have had more vegetables and the serving size could have been a bit more. Its good to hear live Hindi ghazals and old film songs, however, they can have better Artists.

Ambiance - 4.5 / 5Service - 4 / 5Price - 4 / 5Taste - 4.8 / 5Spread (in Buffet lunch) - 4.8 / 5AlaCart variety for Veg Indian Food - 4.5 / 5Stories to narrate - N number of stories!Shahi Maharani is among the best Indian restaurants for Fine dining. Be it any occasion or a casual dinner out of routine, this place is always live. The food is delicious. Dal Makhani is mind blowing. Paneer gravies are amazing. Chat item are worth mentioning. Time spent with loved ones are priceless

Went down on the last night of CNY and ordered 4 mains with loads of parathas. The food was served in very large dishes which are impressive to the eye to see but that's where our hopes for good food stopped!! The prawn dish had loads of curry with only 4 prawns in it. The chicken korma dish was exactly the same and surprise surprise the butter chicken was no different. You only get 2 shish kebabs and loads of garnish and then the parathas were so tiny that we had to order around a dozen for the family of 2 adults and 2 children. The bill was ridiculously expensive and best of all the prawn dish and the chicken Kirma dish tasted very similar!!When I confronted the manger he instead argued back defending the restaurant and didn't even bother to apologize?!!!???What a waste if s night and leaving us with a bad taste and smell to last. Encourage all my mates not to visit and do not recommend this to anyone 
5
If you want to cherish authentic North Indian food in Singapore this is the place to visit. They have a great variety in tandoor as well as seafood preparations. One very interesting feature which I chose from the menu is "make to order" dish. You can actually suggest the Chef as to how you would want any North Indian dish to be prepared and they prepare it. The ambience too has a very traditional Indian look. All in all a very good restauran
5
I love a curry and will often pop into an Indian restaurant wherever travel takes me. So it takes somewhere really special to make it to the top of my list. But this fine but classic Indian restaurant always delivers. A well appointed environment, with friendly and attentive staff are the start. But the food. Oh the food... The sizzling Malai chicken kebab is out of this worldly. And somehow the combination of flavor and texture of the masalas and the vindaloo just sing in perfect culinary unison. It's not cheap, but neither is a Maserati. And I have never left disappointed. Or remotely hungry.
4
The atmosphere is excellent in this superior restaurant.It suits westerners, as cutlery and plates are provided.The main courses are top quality and fairly priced. The cost of extras, however, is excessive; a glass of draught beer is US$10.00; one portion of rice is us$ 6.30 (admittedly enough for 3 -4 diners) and one chutney is $5.5
5
Situated down a remote corridor in the Raffles City Center--but persist. This luxury Indian restaurant is well worth a visit, especially for veggies.There;s a good vegetarian menu and plenty of dishes for everyone else.Tip: Normally there's also live music most nights but call to check if you want to make sure there's some when you visit. Nice atmosphere and extremely attentive service. You also see lots of Indians eating there which tells you everything you really need to know about the place.and its food.It's a popular place so be sure you book a table if you want to eat at a fashionable time

We struggled to find guaranteed gluten free food in Singapore, but were reassured this restaurant could meet our needs. Indeed they did! There were plenty of options and even our 'free' starter of popodoms and accompaniments was gluten free. Food was excellent and reasonably priced (& billed directly to our account at the Fairmont Hotel nearby). We will happily return here again
3
During my second visit , rudely told by the staff that there is no table and told me to get out.Im not going there again.
4
Weekday buffet is priced at 50 plus taxes, which comes to SGD 58, with 1-for-1 free. For the variety and seating it offers (situated at Raffles City mall): couldn't be better. One of the decent places for North Indian food in town.
5
Very good restaurant, with an interesting menu, good service and food well cooked and tasty. They also have live music that is not intrusive.
5
Went for lunch, we were a couple, we chose the buffet option, they had a great offer for 1 to 1, so you pay for 1 person the second is free. Price was 50 SG$ ++.Food variety is great, taste and service too. I recommend this as one of the best Indian I tried.
4
Visited this restaurant during my recent business trip. Its in CBD, in raffles city and came across this as i was trying to find a place to eat dinnerThe ambiance is great, the live music is good and they have very good choice of food. The soup choice was limitedVeg Biriyani was goodOverall a good place to visit for a nice dinner with friends and family seeking indian north indian cuisine
5
My wife and I tend to fly via Singapore when traveling out this way and we always visit this lovely restaurant. It's my favourite Vindaloo in all the world. Good atmosphere and love the music with service to match. Not cheap but it's well worth it. Thank you
5
I enjoyed a business dinner at Shahi Maharani with over 10 of my colleagues and it may just be the best Northern Indian restaurant I have every been to and now one of my favorites in Singapore. Because we had a big group we were able to order a variety of dishes and therefore experienced many options from the menu. They all were absolutely fantastic. Whether it was meat, vegatarian, or fish selections -- all just plain outstanding. We had excellent service for our group and were treated very well. Can't wait to go back.
4
This is a lovely restaurant to visit for a special event.The food is very tasty, full of flavour and authentic. I thoroughly enjoyed the cabaret show as they sang old Bollywood film songs.We were given no guidance on quantity of food so ordered too much.The staff were efficient but the service was slow
1
I am on a week long business trip in Singapore and staying at the Fairmont. I could not contain my excitement when I spotted Shahi Maharani on the 3rd floor being of Indian origin and living in Switzerland. I was having a fabulous time and even coaxed my colleagues to join as the food was simply divine and the staff extremely professional and helpful.A 3-person indian band started to setup their instruments and I was even more excited to see tabla and harmonium. I am also a trained singer in hindustani music and thoroughly enjoyed this.After creating a rapport with the musicians on song requests, I requested them on allowing me to sing one of my favourite semi-classical number. They were more than pleased as I assured them that I was a trained singer. Being an artist myself, this is the ultimate appreciation especially when we sing in clubs and restaurants where diners are mostly interested in banter between themselves!As I was about to start, a very scared waiter ran up to us and told us that 'allowing guests to sing is against restaurant policy'. If this was the case, how did the most crucial stakeholders - the musicians - not know about this. We asked him to recheck and assured him that I was a singer and that I wouldnt embarrass anyone...we also had diners from the the closest tables cheering us to go ahead. The waiter diligently went to check again with the owner (who was actually amongst diners at a table towards the entrance) and returned wit a firm 'no'. I didnt want to make a scene and quietly walked away. On returning to my table I had my ipad with me and showed the waiter my previous singing photos from my FB page as reassurance. The owner was seated behind me and not once come to speak to me about this. This is unacceptable in a restaurant industry and I would go as far as saying - lack of manners! I am also unsure of such a rule as in my singing experience of 15 years have never heard of such a rule at other establishments let alone try to understand the justification or risk behind this rule if the experts, the musicians, have vetted the guest singers.Sadly, all my excitement from the mouth watering food and impeccable service was washed away in a few seconds. The reason - the owners ignorance and ability to treat artists as they should be treated.I am staying at the hotel until Friday morning and have asked the hotel to take my complaint to the restaurant. I hope to receive a response
5
This must rank amongst the best Indian meal we have had. The whole experience was excellent. Superb ambience. Excellent staff and food to cheer. The flavours were distinctive and full. The price with a couple of beers each was SP$181 for the two of us.Go for it
4
Location of the Restaurant is good, close to City Hall MRT. The Restaurant ambiance is very good. Service was quick though we went on a Friday evening. They have live Indian Music, Bollywood songs.
4
Good food.. slightly heavy on the calories!! The lunch buffet is well diversified and offers many options
5
You won't be dissapointed if you like north indian food. The service quality is wonderful as well perfect for a family or business meal
5
Located above City Hall metro, excellent indian food. Live singing from the artists makes dinner even enjoyable. Should go with your loved ones
5
Really good place for Indian food.
Only thing there is no juice provided with buffet. Good verities. Recommend for get together!!
4
Good Food, excellent ambience and great service with ample choice catering to kids and adults. The starters were so good that we feared on it until we realized that it was time to order for the main course. The delicacies are fairly priced for the taste. Very well situated at Raffles City mall and easily accessible by MRT through East West line or Circle line or by bus or taxi.The live soothing music in the background provides a perfect setting for a relaxing evening with family and friends
2
We were here for dinner, we had a starter a plate of samosas, and a couple of naans and 2 vegetarian curries. This is a meal for two that shouldn't cost 80$ but here we are in Singapore and that is the price you pay, however that being said the quality of the food wasn't worth the price.sorry but the food quality is lousy.They had a vegetarian paneer peas dish which looked like it had been through a blender and regurgitated not very pleasant looking. the black dal was deplorable extremely thick and overspiced.If you expect a plate of samosas, you also expect green chutney and sweet chutney at minimum, nobody serves only sweet chutney its unheard of, we had to request that and they got us mango chutney and then the green chutney and then other things we didn't ask for.I can think of a a whole lot or different ways to blow up 80$ in Singapore, visiting this place will not be one of them
3
We were a part of eight, and originally went to Rang Mahal , perhaps the best Indian Restaurant in Singapore. We were turned away, because they were completely sold out ( for the next two days) . Maharani was the next choice for a good sit-down, white table cloth kind of a place. Great location. Crowded, but they could fit us in. The food was very good- our choice was all veg., and we had tomato shorba, veg pakodas, dahi bhalla, tandoori paneer, Naan, Pulav and some gajar halwa. Every item was tasty. But the service was patchy, and delayed. There was live music- popular and Ghazals.I was annoyed to hear the MC announce "South Indian Music" , and we then heard an A R Rahman song in Hindi sung off-key. Except for that sour note, everything was good. They also had live music , but that was Of course, the bill was pretty large, but that was to be expected in a place like that
4
Went there during my stay in Swissotel Singapore. This restuarant is next door to the hotel. The food was authentic Indian with Indian flavour. Quantity of servings were good. The service was quick and polite. Though it was little costly with any item in the menu costing not less than SGD 40. Will visit during my next trip to Singapore too
4
i went here twice for dinner during my current stay in Swissotel, as it was in adjecent mall. on sunday they had live indian music/Gazals as well. Food is excellent. In two visits i with group ate many items like onion pakora, papdi chat, tadka dal, paneer bhurji, kabuli chana masala and butter milk. every thing was excellent. Buttermilk was awesome. Kabuli channa had tasty gravy. Most importantly nothing looked too oily. Being fine dine restaurant its bit expensive, but definately worth it.strognly recoomended
1
The lunch buffet was disappointing. The 3 vegetarian side dishes were horrible. The taste could have been better. The desserts esp the gulab jamun was too sweet. we do not expect this quality of food for
the price charged. Definitely not visiting again.
3
This restaurant serves average food but has a spacious setting and attentive wait staff. There are also cultural performances over dinner. Their prices are higher than average though so this is good only for entertaining overseas guests who want a taste of North Indian food.
5
Nice ambiance and quality foods. Vegetarian food is exceptional. Must try paneer kadahi, daal maharani
Very courteous staff. And service quality is unparalleled
4
The restaurant was nicely furnished. The service was great and the food excellent. The location within the Raffles City Shopping Centre was easy to find on the 3rd floor. Open for buffet lunch and in the evening from 6:30 pm. Reasonably priced.
3
We were at Shahi Maharani for dinner which a reasonably good experience...Assuming it would be busy on a sunday night i had made prior reservations but most of the tables were vacant (good for me, i could choose my table)...they had musicians singing ghazals which was interesting...we ordered for chicken tandoori and a vegetarian platter for appetizers.. the platters that i have seen in other restaurants are rather big in size, this one had 2 pieces each of onion bhajiyas, mini samosas, aloo tikki and stuffed mushrooms....however, they tasted quite good... by now we had assumed that the portions would be small so we ordered for 2 main course dishes between the three of us and assorted breads...the naan/roti and lachha paratha were fresh and tasty.. the paneer makhanwala was thankfully not sweet and I could say it was the best dish of the evening...the bhuna ghost, suggested by the steward was rather disappointing...the onion in the dry gravy was uncooked and there was too little or no salt in the dish..you can go to this place for the fine dine experience...though it is not bad at all, it is certainly not my favourit
5
My girlfriends and I had been on the move for about a week before arriving in Singapore and being vegetarians, hadn't really found anything to suit our palate in the countries we went to first. So the first night we landed in Singapore, we knew we wanted Indian food, GOOD Indian food. We kind of hit the jackpot here. The cottage cheese melted in our mouth.. The dal makhani was divine.. And the rotis, we were SO HAPPY to be getting wheat and not rice!! This was a reminder of home for us. The rating is purely for the food. Nom nom
3
I visited the restaurant for lunch and it wasn't that busy but the staff seemed to be a bit dead and felt like serving customers was a chore that needed to be done. The food is satisfactory more like average in any standard Indian restaurant and its way too over priced for the quality of food and service in return. Do try the Samosa's as starters, they were quite nice. The buffet is also pricey SGD 50 ++ consider it only if you are a non vegetarian or dining solo else as a family not worth it
4
If you are craving for North Indian cuisine in Singapore, this place can offer you some value for money. The weekday lunch buffet has a great 1 for 1 deal, and the Sunday chaat buffet is great too (includes the grill options). Their grill platter is great taste too
4
We had been here a couple of weeks back to celebrate a friend's birthday on a Saturday evening. The interiors and lighting did not impress but the tables were well spaced out lending enough privacy. It was a packed house, yet the service was right on the ball. There was a good variety in the menu and the dishes were a bit off beat. In short the food and ambience was decent and the service outstanding. There are pricier restaurants in Singapore with bad service, so no complains on the cost
2
Being an Indian I know exactly what good Indian food tastes like. I travel a lot to different cities and have experienced how differently the food tastes suiting local palate. I am fine with this adaptation and don"t mind this change however it's disappointing when you visit a super expensive restaurant, declaring themselves as an Indian fine dining and what you get to eat is bad quality stale food.We ordered Paneer Makhni( paneer/ cottage cheese was sour which means it was stale, Dal Maharani which was basic makhni dal without kidney beans, butter nan (which were uncooked and had so much of butter) the only thing I liked was Pushina Parantha which alone costed S$10 !!!! Total bill was 2 people was 100 dollars and believe me it was sheer wastage of money. Presentation was pathetic and food lacks taste.Hate this place and will never ever return back!
2
There are so many great Indian restaurants in Singapore, but this isn't one of them.
Appealing decor, decent service but food was mediocre and over salted.
5
What a lavish indian restaurant. Big portions and great authentic taste. Enjoyed the whole setup and musical night.
4
This restaurant was a surprise visit in the Swissotel hotel during a business trip in Singapore. Everything about the restaurant, the food, service and ambience was awesome. Would definitely visit again !!!
5
Just been here today following a recommendation from a friend living in Singapore. We arrived at lunch to find that there's an al la carte menu and a buffet on offer. We opted for the buffet and were very impressed with the dishes. All very authentic and unique. The fresh garlic naan was particularly taste and quite thin and crisp to our delight. If you are looking for an authentic Indian restaurant then don't miss this one! As a visitor missing their Indian or intrigued to try am Indian out, make your way to SM
3
Brilliant location - brought a gang of my local friends here for Indian food. Great and attentive service. Easy to book a table via hungrygowhere, though some may be a bit confused getting here via Raffles City shopping mall. Unbelievably yummy appetizers and good main courses. Ordered the Gajar Halwa for dessert with ice cream... the halwa was unbelievably dry - not like halwa but more like grated carrot set together in a mould. Will definitely not recommend this dish
4
Dinner for four. Great location in the complex by the Swissotel Stamford. Huge area so tables are well spaced and service is very good. Unobtrusive but on the ball. The food is excellent but some - not us!! - could even find the milder dishes on the spacey side....great menu and well priced for a quality restaurant Bear in mind the serves are very big so one plate could easily be shared between two or three people so you can have a bigger range of tastes
4
@TheKuoKnowsIn a city where South Indian food tends to prevail, it is a pleasure to find a convenietly-located eaterie that serves quality North Indian cuisine.For the budget conscious, the weekday lunchtime buffet can be an affordable treat. With a two-for-the-price-of-one discount, two can eat food fit for king, for much less than a princely sum.The choice of appetisers is pure delight. They are as varied as they are tasty - a great preamble to what comes next. But be warned! It is very easy to over indulge on the crispy samosa and delicate onion bhajis. So try to control yourself.If the appetisers are temptation on a plate, then the selection of curries and main courses are guilty pleasure on a platter. The Tandoori Chicken pieces deserve a special mention. They are succulent, aromatic and far too enticing to not go back for seconds, thirds and even fourths.Shahi Maharani is a great exponent of fine North Indian cooking. As good as I have had anywhere, even London
4
I had a business lunch at Shahi Maharani on 17.04.2015 with my colleagues and clients. The food was very good, the service, ambiance were also equally good. The pricing is also very good for the quality of food served. They can add few more vegetarian dishes and deserts
2
I was after a nice curry and a bottle of wine to wash it down with. I'm in Singapore on business and had limited time to hunt down a restaurant. I knew this would be expensive because of the location, but I consoled myself that the ambience and food would be great.The service was fine. The ambience was upscale but no real atmosphere. I was given a couple of free papadoms (rolled into a cylinder, which I am not used to) and some bland pickles. The cheapest bottle of red was $62SGD but most started at about $80SGD.The food was bland. I had a chicken dish which had 2 stars for heat next to it, it must have been one of the least tasty curries I have ever had. It looked the part and had a very rich sauce but no discernible flavour. The rice was ok.There was loads of it. I have a big appetite and could not finish it. I also had a Kashmiri Naan which also lacked any real character.Considering the price, I came away feeling very disappointed
4
We eat a lot of Indian food.... I thought this was a pretty good place. Portions are very large and we ordered starters, 2 main dishes and some bread and it would have easily fed 3 people. Cost was $200 for 2 of us.... Which seemed a little expensive but was ok
5
It is really a nice and beautiful place for indian food lover...specially their kebab items are awesome...true north indian food...atmosphere is also very gorgeous...during dinner they played live music...nice n slow romantic indian gajal...really made the dinner very romantic for us along with our parents...
4
You will have a many options to choose from Veg & Non Veg Indian food. I liked Dal Tadka & Veg Biryani the most. It is little expensive but you will feel a good authentic north Indian taste. It is near CITY Hall MRT.
4
We had a very tasty Indian dinner at Shahi Maharani North Indian Restaurant. The food selection is huge, the service is fast, the waiters are friendly and the price is appropriate.
We also enjoyed the live music, which contributed to a pleasant atmosphere.
1
We have been to Singapore many times and almost always stay on the Club Floor of the Swissotel Stamford. We have visited the Shahi Maharani on a few previous occasions when we feel home sick and craving for some Indian food. The food has been alright on previous occasions and nothing outstanding. However on my most recent visit a week ago we had a truly terrible experience. We entered at around 9:30pm and found the attitude of the staff extremely cold and indifferent and not welcoming at all. Infact around 10pm since they were approaching closing time, while we were eating our food they switched off the air-conditioning and music and then proceeded to make a real commotion with all the cutlery completely disregarding our presence, until I had to tell them to keep all the noise down. We were paying customers and entitled to the ambience we were paying for.The food was also below average and the chicken pieces in the Chicken Tikka and the Butter Chicken were big and chewy. The daal was almost cold and the rotis stiff. Would've got better food in a Food Court. There was no manager in sight to take responsibility for the utter lack of concern, quality and service, hence nobody responsible to even complain to. This place is expensive with bills for 2 easily going above $100, however the quality of the service and food left much to be desired. Standards here have really plummeted drastically. Avoid, save your time and money
5
As you'll see from my past reviews, I eat at a lot of different Indian Restaurants. Shahi is certainly up amongst the most pricey, so is it really worth the 20-30+ price tag? Firstly, the decor is fantastic and if you enjoy a regal atmosphere, this spacious restuarant will not disappoint. There is attention to every detail - table placement, bar, kitchen, place mats, ceiling, art, you name it. It is a feast for the senses. But that's not what I came for. The food really was phenomenal - every dish offered a taste I hadn't encountered at other Indian restaurants. Clearly, you are paying for interesting food, not just interior design and location. Finally, waiters are attentive and its clear a tight ship is run here. The atmosphere is semi-formal, but I would feel comfortable dressed in shorts or a jacket. My only complaint is the price of beer, which is around $13-17 for a Carona or Erdinger outside happy hour. They have a lunch time buffet which I can't wait to try. Is it the best Indian food I've had so far? If you ignore price, definitely yes.In a nutshell, expensive but truly unique and phenomenal food in majestic and spacious surroundings
5
We were at this restaurant before a few years. The best Indian food outside India. They have live music and singers performing at dinner time. We had been here 3-4 times and every time we ate there, the food was at its best. Awesome Indian food. We would love to go there again and again
5
We have spent a 5 night break in Singapore & have eaten in this restaurant twice! We can honestly say that on both occasions the food has been excellent & probably far better than any Indian food we have eaten anywhere else on our travels. Yes it is expensive but then we would expect that in any restaurant in a major city. If we were here longer we would go again
4
Very expensive, food is okay. Ambience sets it apart though with live hindi music. If going in a big group, good to have an experience of a fine dining Indian restaurant. Not some place where I would go again
1
I made online booking. Turned up and no reservation and staff were quite rude too!Disappointing! I will not be back
5
We have been dining at The Shahi Maharani for over 10 years now, and have never had a bad meal!The food is excellent and the staff are always so friendly.The atmosphere is is also brilliant, they have a small stage in the corner of the restaurant where musicians play and sing traditional Indian music and songs.The place is always busy, and bookings are strongly recommended.TIPS - Butter chickenRaan SikandraPrawn chilli vindalooAll dishes here are lip smacking, you won't be disappointed!Thanks to Joti and his team for looking after us all these years
4
Authentic Indian food, very nice ambiance. Service, though is not bad but some improvement might help. Visited on a Saturday afternoon with not many guests in the restaurant so may be the staff was a little slow. Staff was very courteous.
4
Very near to Fairmont Hotel. Good Indian food available. Staff very courteaous. You can ask the bill to be billed to your room if you are staying in Fairmont or Swiss Hotel there.
3
Starting from chats, starters, main course and desserts, it was less for a buffet lunch. Ambience is good Staffs were kind. Priced at around S$45 for a buffet is pretty much for the food offered. On the whole it wasn't satisfying.
Felt ok.
5
Good decor and atmosphere
staff - very courteous and attentive
food - very tasty . played safe and ordered samosas and pakora. They were tasty and not oily. Shaslik as mains is a winner.
we'll come back soon
5
Are you looking for a great Indian dining experience in Singapore?Shahi Maharani is worth seeking out for a great Indian feast. An expansive menu of genuine dishes, thoughtfully prepared and enticingly presented.This was my second visit this year, I will return again in a few months for sure
4
I am very fond of the ambience in this restaurant, and as soon as you make a first step, you fully emerge into Indian culture with distinctive deco and music. Food was exquisite, large portions, and not too spicy. The price reflected the quality well, suitable for special occasions or business meetings
5
- Expensive food (by SG standards, not London standards)- Super good service and staff (someone waits your table constantly)- Meal is superb, servings are bigger than expected and tastier than I imagined =)  - Sizzlers are worth trying - they do them pretty well - Kulfi platter is great- If possible head there after 8pm to enjoy live music. - Make a reservation ahead of time
3
Some positives about the restaurant:- Nice live performance of Hindi ghazals/film songs(dont know if this is a regular affair or only on weekends)- NIce ambience.and interiors.Areas for improvement- Tried vegetarian food and found the taste to be average.- Some of the items listed on the menu(especially in the desert) were not available.- Service was mediocre as couple of dishes ordered were not delivered and some came in late.- Very expensive for the quality,taste(for vegetarian options) and sprea
4
The Indian food is one of the best I have had in a long time. Though the prices were high, it is not too high for a big city like Singapore. We ordered the Palak Paneer (Spinach and cheese curry) and the Butter chicken curry which were both excellent and tasty. I just wish the chicken curry had more chicken in it for the price (US$30). The waiters could have smiled and been more friendly. They were, however, very professional, not warm or friendly. For the food though, it was worth the trip
4
I went for their 1-for-1 buffet lunch with a bunch of colleagues. The decor is beautiful and the staff are welcoming. The buffet spread was awesome - they have an array of salads, accompaniments, starters, curries, and desserts. I particularly enjoyed the Rajma Tikki, Saffron rice, Naans, and Gulab Jamun. All of us thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Shahi Maharani is definitely worth checking out
4
i order dal and roti sabzi. Enviornment was quite nice. However food was quite tasty but bit expensive

Great restaurant , there was nothing that I could fault . Service was good , decor absolutely beautiful , and the quality of food quite outstanding . Would definitely go back .

We found Shahi Maharani Restaurant a top quality restaurant for north Indian cuisine in Singapore.
The variety, finesse in preparation, service - all are of high order. Of course, it is pricey but I would say, worth every bit of it.

Southern Indian most common in Australian so always good to try the Northern cuisine when available. Food tasty. Staff attentive without being intrusive. Nice atmosphere. Prices on the high side but excellent location if staying at the Fairmont or Swissotel.
3
Nice pleasing place with reasonably good interiors, the staff is quite cordial and service quite prompt and attentive. The food is delicious , though some dishes may not go well as authentic indian taste but come very close being outside India. The prices are moderate. Would definitely like to revisit
4
We really enjoyed the food, and prices were reasonable for Singapore. Nice restaurant in a convenient location. Service was the only problem - we were ignored by our waitress unless we actively flagged her down. It took way to long to get drinks, and the check. She walked past the folder with the credit card in it three times before she bothered to pick it up. Waiters at other tables seemed to be much more attentive
5
Tasty & authentic fare awaits you in a family- friendly environment! Whether it be the Bhindi, the Paneer dish or the Chana Masala.....the Butter Naan, the Roomali Roti( a real delicacy rarely available outside India ) or the Pudhina Paratha....or indeed the Kulfi, we got our taste buds fully satiated Sunday night! Though virtually every table was taken, the place hardly looked 'crowded' & the brisk and attentive staff were readily on hand to meet your every need, in typical polite Indian fashion!! I'm an India resident who is demanding on quality & I know what I'm saying, believe you me

Shahi Maharani has been one of my favorite Indian restaurants in Singapore over the years. We went as a family over last weekend for dinner and found that the service levels have deteriorated a lot. The quality of food is good, but the lack of a smile and the time it takes them to take the order and then serve makes one think if this is the same place we used to love. I will not recommend this restaurant unless they buck up and improve their approach and attitude to deliver better service
4
Tasty and well presented dishes. The "panipuri" appetizer had an interesting presentation with shot glasses.Staff was very attentive when there weren't that many tables filled but as the restaurant got busier, the service lacked as well. However, authentic North Indian cuisine and an appropriate setting for both business and social dinners
1
I went to Shahi Maharani on Saturday night. It wasn't busy and I could see 3-5 tables not occupied but I was asked to wait which I did for 15 minutes. No one seems to bother about a person waiting for table while staff is chatting and laughing on counter opposite to waiting area.May be Shahi Maharani staff does not care for 1 customer as that might not be huge bill for them.Very disappointing and disrespectful attitude of staff and management towards customers
4
Excellent Atmosphere, Delicious Food and extremely friendly staff .Though prices are slightly high but worth every Dollar !
5
I had the best north Indian food in Singapore.We went for the lunch ,the food was very good.I really enjoyed the lunch.The staff was well trained .The starters & main course both were very good .
5
I am from Delhi. Still paneer makhan wala we had here was THE best I have ever had.
great food, OK ambiance, "live ghazals" are actually some people singing random bollywood songs. but again great place for good food.
5
Loved the food here. Would come again when I feel like indulging in good ambience and amazing food. The live orchestra singing an "Indian"-ified version of Jingle Bells on Christmas Eve was a nice touch.
5
I recently went here after a 10 year absence, and it was just as good as I remembered. Best palak paneer in the world. It was so good we came back twice in one week. Good atmosphere. Live Indian music. Fabulous food and great cocktails.
5
Went for dinner with colleagues and we had an excellent time. Food that we shared was just delicious: Roganjosh, Tika Masala, Nan breads, Raita, etc.
We were surprised to even enjoy live indian music.
You will not be disapointed.

Shahi Maharani serves Mughal cuisine, specifically the dishes that were cooked for the royals. Tikkas, Kebabs, tandoori chicken, koftas, briyanis and many more of authentic Mughal dishes are served here. We tried their smoked tomato soup, chicken tikka, shesh kebab, fish tikka, murgh tikka and lamb chops for starters and tandoori roti and prawn briyani for the mains with malai kofta as side and ended it off with nutty delight, their very own pistachio ice cream with peanut caramel brittles on top and freshly brewed masala chai.The starters were excellent. We loved the lamb chops. Five pieces of well marinated and cooked lamb chops over a bed of sliced onions served in a sizzling pan was unique. The tomato soup was nice too. We noticed that all the dishes were served swiftly even though they were fully booked for the evening. The prawn briyani was one of the best I ever had. The malai koftas were awesome too. Special mention goes to the pistachio ice cream with peanut caramel brittles quite an unique dish that would please any palette. They have gazals ( live performance) from 8 pm onwards. The decor was good ( renovated last year) and the waiters were attentive. Overall, it's an excellent place that serves fantastic Mughal cuisine but the price is on little steep side
5
I don't think you will find such a beautiful property serving Indian food in South East Asia. It was like either in Dubai or Mumbai for my local Indian dinner. Food was awesome. Try anything and everything especially Rogan E Josh ( Lamp serving ) with Roomali Roti. I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends travelling to Singapore
5
We decided to check out this restaurant after hubby heard a good review of it in Thailand! The food was excellent. The review had recommended sabzi sizzler and we duly checked it out. It's basically koftas in a thick curry. But the curry had us clean the serving sizzler plate . The paneer tikkas, gaulati kebabs, chicken handi -- each dish couldn't be faulted. While the prices r on the higher side, they give u a large quantity of each dish. The sizzler had six large koftas; the paneer sizes were really large... my son was delighted that they were serious abt the cheese when he ordered a cheese nan-- it had one long thick layer like a sandwich and not a few sprinkles. The kulfis were excellent and my search for an authentic kulfi is finally over. We ordered a plate of jalebis expecting an individual plate of two. We were served a plate of 8 jalebis!!! ( that too fried in ghee...brought back fond memories of Payal in Vadodara which also fries jalebis in ghee) ... Excellent service too
5
This restaurant is located on the second floor of Raffles City Shopping Centre building . Had a tough time finding it .The restaurant has a great ambience ,live Ghazals are played & you can request a ghazal too. The Menu is quite comprehensive & service is excellent .We (2 of us)ordered Dal maharani (Makhni) with Tandoori Roti ,Lachhcha Parantha ,Chhas & Mango Lassi .The Dal ,Roti & Mango Lassi were awesome ,parantha & Chhas need some improvement I felt. The food overall was quite good but little expensive (we paid 64 S$)but they may be charging for the ambience too. You should try it if not overtly concerned about prices

had a fantastic time celebrating my mum's 63rd birthday in this restaurant.
we enjoyed the food and a had a fantastic time.
the grilled lamb chops are very nice.
the restaurant had a homey feel but bit difficult to find...
3
I have been to this restaurant couple of times and have liked the food here.Restaurant has good ambience and food items are tasty.It is also located at good place
4
We decided to go here, after here good reviews from lot of friends. And we were no disappointed. The ambience is great with live ghazal singing. Me and hubby had pleasant time and requested a few of our favourite songs. The mili jhuli thali of starters was superb. I specially loved the aloo mint tikki. We ordered all veggie main course and enjoyed it will Roomali roti. Might be costly but worth it
3
I was here for a lunch meeting. Service at the entrance was quick but no one led us to our table which had been reserved in advance. We were just pointed to a general direction. Service at the table wasn't great either with one waiter blaming the other for their poor service.We ordered ala carte and the food was served after a short wait but there was nothing particularly special about the food. The chicken tikka was by far the best of our orders. The salmon tikka which was 5 little pieces at 30 bucks was disappointing as it was dry and somewhat fishy in smell. The bhindi masala and palak paneer were relatively tasty but I've had better in Singapore. The mixed basket of breads was really good, with a decent portion and mix. However, it was the chicken briyani that was the biggest let down. Bland tasteless chicken in colored basmati rice is what came to mind. Couldn't fathom where on earth could they have learnt to make such a forgettable briyani. Such a pity! The mango lassi was also very light and seemed to be lacking in something ... the mango taste.At over $70 per head it simply wasn't justified given that there was nothing even reasonably good about the food. The ambience was the only saving grace but there was no live ghazal artists there either throughout lunch. Would definitely not be visiting there again.

I went to shahi maharani along with my husband and two kids (aged 10 and 6) on Sunday , 15th sept . It was after 1.45 and we were seated almost immediately . The ' no waiting ' turned out to be the most enjoyable part of the meal ! About 10 mins after we started eating , we were told that ' the buffet would close' and were asked to get whatever food we needed . After that we just had to speed up our eating and with two kids at the table , it wasn't an easy task . The food was insipid ,curries were barely warm , rotis weren't replenished and choice for vegetarians was really limited . At around 2.15, they started winding up the buffet even though the patrons were halfway through the meals and I have to say that this would be the first time I left a buffet feeling hungry . The biggest surprise was the bill wherein they had charged for four full adult meals ( unlike other buffets where kids are charged half ) ! I would never go back to this place not would I recommend this place to friends or family
3
The food is very good and also worth. Ambiance is very good. The only thing which i dint like was the music. The singers were very loud singing the Hindi songs. We need to book the seats in the restaurant before hand as it would be crowded in the weekends
5
At first it is not very easy to locate this restaurant even though it is in the one of shopping mall. Food and ambience is great. First time when I went for lunch there , on one of the Corner few people were playing the musical instruments which was really soothing and was perfectly going with a relaxed lunch.Variety and taste of the food is great , they have buffet for lunch usually . We don't leave the restaurant without a masala chai
5
Lovely. Just love that place. Nice food, nice live band and such a suitable background. The food was delicious. Mango lassi was the bomb. The tandoori fish was off the hook. No fishy smell and it's suitable for the childrens since it's boneless. And it didnt taste anything like fish. Lovely....... I will recommend my friends to come down here if they visit Singapore.
4
Authentic North Indian fare and a wholesome Buffet!....Pullao, Paneer Makhani, Fried Dal, Palak Alu Saag with Papad, Gulab Jamun, Jalebi!....with hot Naan & Roti.A bit heavy though
4
Restaurant was suggested by my Singapore friend. Went to this place with 2 friends, and the experience was gr8. It serves authentic Indian food. Dal Makhani, Chicken Vindaloo, Aloo Dum and Naans were all awesome.However, a bit expensive. Food for three without alcohol will cost SGD 120-150
5
LOVE: Grilled Prawns, Chicken Kebab, Lamb Chops, Papdi Chaat and the good service. If you like North Indian food, you've got to dine here. I've dined here many times and my guests are always impressed.
3
Good attentive service .disappointed with the prawn briyani, the starters were average.chicken tikka very ordinary .nan and roomalli roti were very good so was the kulfi .highly unlikely we will be visiting this restaurant again soon
5
If you want best indian restaurant in singapore then this restaurant is the very best. Not other restaurant can compare with this. Best indian food , service , quality, once again overall the very best restaurant.
5
Patronize this restaurant each year when in Singapore. Nice atmosphere, good service and lovely food. If you like Indian food, give it a try...........I think you will like it!
5
This was a pick from a "foodie" in our local office who knows I love Indian food, and all three of the curries we had were as good as any I have enjoyed in the UK or India. But the highlight for me was that I was able to eat all 3; after explaining that I was lactose intolerant (no dairy) the chef made not only my choice but those of my colleagues dairy free, as well as toning down the chicken vindaloo to the medium that we had asked for. Naan was fresh and done properly, Bengali fish curry and Chili Prawns were excellent, even the saffron rice was notable. Service was unexceptional but certainly very professional. A rare 5 stars, we all agreed we will come back
4
Ever since our favorite North Indian restaurant in Singapore (Bukhara) closed, we have been exploring Indian restaurants. We had a la carte dinner at 7:30 at Shahi Maharani. Chicken makhanwala (S$28++) and rogan josh (S$28++) with one very cheesy naan filled us up. Some of the cuts of lamb weren't the best, but the butter chicken was good with cuts of both light and dark meat. We appreciated that they did not charge for mango chutney. As we ended our meal, live entertainment (tabla and electone, singing) started. The restaurant was well attended but not full. We feel that the prestige location and the cost of the live entertainment was included in the price of the food which seemed on the expensive side compared to some of our more highly-rated Indian restaurants. The servers were polite and helpful, and they came to the table to check to see if everything was to our satisfaction. Those who crave live entertainment would rate the experience more highly than we would. Considering the cost, we would rate the entire experience between average and very good
3
While the atmosphere is good and they have live ghazals, but service is average. Many of the waitresses had a Stern look on their face. The food on the other hand was extremely good by Singapore standards. The prices should have been a fraction lower, even for being an exclusive Indian restaurant.
5
We went for a Sunday dinner, the restaurant was almost full. The decor is quite good, the staff most attentive and the service was quite prompt.The Mili Juli Thali is a platter of starters comprising of 2 pieces each of veg samosas, Aloo mint tikkis, veg pakoras and tandoori mushrooms. My daughter simply loved the tikkis. The Bengali fish curry was simply superb with the right blend of spices and the fish was fresh and well cooked.We also had the Hariyali Murgh: chicken cooked in a gravy of spinach and greens. The portions were quite generous; quite enough for 4 adults. My only complaint is with the tandoori parathas which were literally dripping with butter! The paranthas were crisp and perfectly made, though the chef could have gone a bit easy on the butter.Lastly, I can say that after a long time had perfectly made, authentic gulab jamuns with the fragrance of gulab jal! The rabri was also perfect. All in all, a very memorable meal. We would definitely love to go again! One of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore
4
We ordered mix daal and veg jaipuri with naan. while naans were very fresh and soft, the most I liked was veg jaipuri preparation. It has very subtle spices and had different flavor which did not overpower vegetables. Daal was good and I felt its not very spicy and oily unlike other restuarnats. Turn off was mango lassi, which was served at room temperature and felt it was made from stale butter milk. It wasn't sweet enough. Told them to fix it but it was same again. Requested them to cancle it and they did it happily, so no worries. It is little expensive but looking at ambience and food qualiy I think it is ok. Give it a try
4
Wish there'd been more than two of us as the menu had so many intriguing options. Settled for onion bhaji, the smoky eggplant (yum!) and their version of butter chicken. All arrived quickly. Naan was especially good. Attentive servers made sure we didn't go thirsty. They were not giving it away: dinner for two, with beers and tip, came to S$150
5
The Indian food available at Shahi Maharani North Indian Restaurant is just awesome. The taste of each and every dish is mouth watering and wrth eating. It is a place to spend time and money as the taste is so good at such reasonable rates.
5
Brilliant, with a feeling like sitting in a resturant in Mumbai or Delhi. Every dish is prepared with original indian authentic tase and with all spices imported from India. Ambience and cleanliness is very impressive. Tamatar aur Simla Mirch Ka Shorba is a must try.
3
We went on lunch time @ Shahi Maharani , based on the recommendation of Trip advisor:
well , we made our choice for the buffet : not a lot of choices but good .
Nice place but noisy during peak time (1 pm)
4
We spent the new year eve at this great Indian restaurant. Even though we had made our bookings on internet - which i later learnt was not permitted for that night - even then they accommodated us. the food, service and ambiance was great
5
Highly recommend this restaurant. Setting is lovely, menu is fantastic, and staff are wonderful. Have eaten here over a period of years, and standard os consistently high. Prices are reasonable for food and drinks, and have observed how good staff are with visiting children. Recommend for either couples or families
2
We went to this restaurant twice - It's at a good location, City Link mall, good parking facilities, lots of shops nearby etc. On both instances, the food was nothing great., Once we had the buffett, and that was the bigger letdown of the two. The buffett was cold, stale food that seemed like prepared the day before and let to dry. There are far better Indian restaurants in Singapore, at far cheaper prices. This is nothing great
5
Few things about this restaurant I would like to share.1. Very Indian and grand ambiance2. Good variety of food to choose from.3. Quick service4. Good location, easy to access. Take exit A from city hall MRT and its on 3rd floor at Raffles City Center.5. Try the one on one for lunch (buffet)..Go early
3
Went with the family for their Sunday lunch Buffet, The settings are very Palatial and ambiance very good however the food was average at best.The chaat was good but the kebabs and mains were a let down. We feel Yantra and Vansh are a much better option for Sunday Lunch
4
Location: The restaurant is on the first floor of the shopping centre attached to Swissotel Hotel.We visited the restaurant for dinner, and are vegetarian. There were 4 children in our group, and the staff were courteous.Ambiance: They had live music with a couple singing ghazals / songsThe traditional north Indian food was delicious. The dish quantity was decent. Service as a bit slow but efficient.Apparently (not sure), they have a lunch buffet as the restaurant is in the financial district which is modestly priced and popular with professionals. Also, at the time of visit, the restaurant was also running a Standard Chartered Credit Card PromotionTo sum up: would visit again for a special occasion or to impress someone, as can get similiar (but not as delicious) food near Mustafa Centre on Serangoon Road / Little India for probably 40% of the price
4
Since we were staying close by, and our family prefers Indian food, we visited Raffles City Centre twice here for both lunch and dinner.While the food is a bit on the expensive side, we did not have the opportunity to peruse various Indian restaurants in Singapore for the best value, but can confidently say the food was very good if you're craving North Indian/Punjabi fare.Highly recommend the Dal Makhani. Gobi Aloo and Paneer Makhani also pretty good. The Roomali roti has egg so be sure to check if you are a vegan
3
Ordered Romali Roti and Malai Kofta - serving size was good. Kofta's were rather large. Disappointment was that the curry was very salty
5
Very buzy place. polite staff. live music is playing all the time. foood is authentic induan with. a wide range to select veg & non veg varieties. loved the food & everything else. average dish costs around $20, nan/rotiabout$9 each
5
Indian food is always good. Indian dinner in Shani Maharani restaurant was excellent. Simply the best Indian dinner ever. Place was hard to find from mall and hotel complex. Recommendations from our hotel helped to choose and to find Shani Maharani restaurant.
4
This was an above average Indian restaurant. My only issue is the spice level was weak... We ordered the spiciest dishes on the menu and the waiter warned us but it didn't even make us break a sweat.
1
Had heard lots of good things about Shahi Maharani and the ambience there so went with loads of expectations. Unfortunately - everything was a let down - the food was very ordinary - the much touted live music was missing in action and the service was non existen
4
restaurant is situated in RafflesCity shopping center albeit not in the most visible part of the mall. food is really good (check out their speciality prawns, cottage cheese with spinach or Indian ice-cream). service is also very attentive and nice (you can easily rely on their reco). ambience is ok though probably this is the weakest part of their offer. finally, prices as for Singapore are ok too. for 3 course menu with soft drinks for 2 people we paid less than 130SGD
4
We tried this restaurant during our last trip to Singapore.This place is located into the Mall you can find within Swissotel Stamford and Fairmont hotel.The ambiance is lovely with decorations and furniture in pure indian style.The food is excellent! Really, it recalls perfectly the original taste.Service is very good; all people were very kind and efficient.Price not so cheap, but this is a general characteristic in town.SUGGESTED !!
4
We were invited guests on the evening of the Diwali festivity. The restaurant had organised a buffet for the occasion, hence the review can be unintentionally off target compared to the a-la-carte menu. However the ambiance was very pleasant and they had organised very competent performers of traditional Indian music. The buffet was in our opinion excellent, including the dishes specifically prepared for the festivity. If that is a reflection of the normal menu, it is a place that it is worth visiting again, which we will - and after that a further review will follow.We were pleased with the service as well. Unfortunately we can't comment on the value for money because being guests, we did not pay for the dinner
5
Butter chicken was to die for! Service was also very friendly and everything went so smoothly. We asked the concierge in our hotel to recommend us a nice indian restaurant and she did a very good job. She told us that she goes there often, too
5
This is an excellent Indian restaurant, with a great location near City Hall. The a la carte menu is fabulous. Everything on this menu is great - this is one of the better restaurants for North Indian cuisines in Singapore (albeit standards are somewhat variable from day to day). As with most Indian restaurants, the buffet lunch (S$46, but 1-for-1, so really S$23 per person) is a good deal. But as with most Indian buffet lunch deals, this is avoidable - unless you are in to warmed-over leftovers from previous day's lunch
4
Good ambience, prompt service, excellent food. We ordered soup, tandoori subzi, naan/roti and paneer makhani. Tomato soup had a taste different from rest of the restaurants. They even had live music.
4
Visited the restaurant with family. The ambience is very elegant and pleasing with widely spread out tables and live indian music. The food is pricey but delicious. One of the best vegetarian biriyanis I've ever had!
5
Very NiceAmbience You Could Get IN Another Country Very Good Food Good service ghazals in the evening and the food moderately priced. the overall all experience of the restuarent was very good .
4
I went twice to Shahi Maharani in span of 3 days. Once with business guest and second time alone. The kebabs were great and so was the vegetarian meal. Service was good. However, no live music was played in the evening.Overall, great food and decent ambience
5
My wife and myself had dinner last night the 16th of august 2012 at Shahi Maharani in singapore.overall experience Excellent1. clean2. good drink list3. good food list4. served promptly5. drinks well presented6. service was good7. we had Prawns, Mutton , Chicken and vegetables with a basket of various breads8. price very reasonable, was even better with 15% of Creditcardexcellent will be there agai
5
Asked my hotel where to go for a meal as I'm a veggie and was bored with the pasta's and pizzas, so was told about this restaurant It was one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been to, been to many from London, india and around Europe They had live music who was excellent singer as he could sing and he did song request for my mr,Good food, great restaurant would go agai

Today we had a few clients at office and we thought of taking them to Shahi Maharani North Indian Restaurant at Raffles City Shopping Centre for Lunch1. let me start with the worst thing of all --> The food didn't had any taste at all, definately not North-Indian.2. The menu was not properly planned. Almost all dishes were dry or with little thick gravy.3. As a true lover of North-Indian food, can't imagine a luch buffet without one of the favouraties like Butter chicken / Chicken Tikka Masala / chicken or Mutton Curry etc. 3. On vegetarian side, not a single dish paneer dish, which I would say as a 'Must Have' item in North-Indian menu.4. Well, the most irritating part was that out of 8 dishes served on the buffet table, There was not a single instance when all the dishes were available. We had to literally request atleast 2-3 times before we expect any refill.The only thing we found worth appericiating was the staff and pitty on them for facing the frustated customers due to poor management.My Advice To It's management: Please check upon other restaurants and compare your menu items and taste
4
Went for a quick dinner here on Saturday night, glad we booked as it was busy! Ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh and the Murgh Tikka Masala. Both good dishes, well sliced and not too creamy which is often a mistake made. Good rice and nice naan bread. I would return for the food. However it was freezing cold (mate because it's in a shipping centre!!) and the lighting was too bright. Stick some candles on the table, turn the lights down a bit and it'll be a lot more intimate!! Service was good. Which is as good as it gets in most places in Singapore!!
4
Located at the 3rd Floor in Raflles City Mall, it's very easy to reach this restaurant. You can get of at either City Hall or Raffles City MRT and could walk up to this restaurant. Talking about the food and ambience, it gives you a proper Indian setting with some delicious food. It's not too expensive either, you will get good quality food at reasonable price. Their menu has lots of variety ranging from proper Indian food to nice selection of sea foods. I loved the chilly prawn's here...
5
Food, service, quality, cleanliness, taste too good....!Location is on the 3rd floor of the Mall. Apart from locating the hotel, we enjoyed every part of it. Was so impressed that went there twice in 2 days. Though food is expensive when compared to other hotels, it is worth each cent u pay....!Would definitely rate it as the best North Indian food I have tasted in Singapore
