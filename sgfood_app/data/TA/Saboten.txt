One of my favorite katsu restaurants with the perfect katsu sauce and salad dressing.
I love the tenderloin and salmon katsu and the crispy skin fried to perfection. Yummy!

The speciality here is tonkatsu and prices are not very cheap. However the portions are decent and the tonkatsu served is nicely done, juicy and delicious. Service is good, the the staff comes quickly to ask if you need more shredded lettuce, green tea, etc.

I love the tonkatsu here - juicy and tender. The free flow cabbage, rice and miso soup is a bonus too. The service is good too.

We came across this Japanese restaurant quite by chance. We were simply looking for a decent meal with enough privacy for a nice chat over lunch. Saboten (サボテン = cactus) did not disappoint. Both of us ordered the tonkatsu pork loin set, and my oh my, it sure turned out to be quite a feast! The salad was simple yet surprisingly refreshing - it comprised freshly shredded cabbage mixed with a sprinkling of sesame seeds ground with a small mortar and pestle set, and a dash of either sesame or yuzu dressing (do try both dressings!).The star of the meal was of course the pork loin tonkatsu - its exterior was flaky and crispy while the meat within was succulent and juicy. It was dipped gently in Saboten’s special tonkatsu sauce mixed with the same ground sesame seeds. The meal also included a choice of two side dishes (e.g. tofu, fried shrimp, edamame), chawanmushi (egg custard dish), miso soup, rice and a generous scoop of matcha/green tea ice cream for dessert. We also ordered hot green tea.Service was friendly, professional and prompt. The meal cost about SGD29/£16/USD22/¥2,354 per set per person, including taxes. If you’re in the “garden city” of Singapore but craving some authentic Japanese tonkatsu, Saboten is not a bad choice

Should one likes Tonkatsu( fried with breadcrumbs) either pork loin, fishes or others this is the place to go. Special lunch packages are available for less than $20. It comes with their cabbage salad with Goma or Yuzu dressing. Miso soup, bowl of rice and dessert. For an additional dollar you have Chawanmushi. Pork loin with radish comes to more than $24. The cabbage is all you can eat! The food is Japanese in origin

The best seller meal is Pork Katsu. The set come together with chawanmushi, 1 scoop of ice cream and of course the free flow cabbage. There is salad dressing for the cabbage, u can be full by just eating of cabbage. However the waiters will clean up everything once u finish the meal and does not fill up green tea after that

A pretty good experience at Saboten with a really well deep fried pork, crunchy on the outside and succulent on the inside.The cabbage was fresh and green.Sauces to accompany the meat and cabbage was well done with some zing to ensure flavour and taste.Service was prompt and sharp.Best of all, there's green tea ice cream to top-up the whole experience at the end

I went for lunch on a weekday. Was pleasantly surprised to find there wasn't any queue although no reservations were made. The promo of Hungarian mangalica katsu lunch was available at reasonable price <$30 with free flow of rice, miso and salad. Loved the crispy batter, the way it was done. For the meat, I thought it would have been better if they cut it thinner but that's their style I guess. Overall, a value for money lunch with efficient service

The best I've ever had so far. I even went to the one in shinjuku in Japan which is not as good as this one. Mainly because of the poor service provided. In Singapore the waitresses are very attentive and refill the cabbage frequently. Also, saboten branches in Japan only serve pork, no chicken.Besides chicken, the tonkatsu served here is superb!! It's very juicy and tender! P/s : free refill for rice, miso soup and cabbage for set menu

Our friends have been in Singapore for a while and suggested this place for lunch. Mrs Vicar and I shared a mixed tempura set menu dish for two. There was so much if it we hardly ate anything until very late in the evening. Apart from sushi we're not familiar with Japanese food, so the the items are best described as, miso soup, a mixed boiled egg in a cup with meat and fish, shredded cabbage, sesame seeds that you grind in a personal mortar and pessil, pickled radish and tempura fried pork, cheese and salmon. All of this seemed to arrive at once from the friendly waiters

This is a real chain restaurant from Japan. I was surprised that I can have real Japanese Tonkatsu in Singapore. Price comparably cheaper than other restaurants since you can get a whole set meal with soup, steam eggs, and a dessert. Free rice and vegetables!

This particular has staff with good and courteous service. One of the reason i'll frequent this restaurant.

The pork used here are of average quality only. The cooking is good. I like to sesame sauce for the cabbage, which make it more tasty.

Always feel guilty after having deep fried food items but not this one! The pork cutlet was so so good with their special breadcrumbs, juicy inside and crispy outside, cabbages are so fresh too! Service staff is friendly!

Food: Ordered the Tenderloin set. Meat is tender, crust is not too oily and comes with free flow of chilled cabbage which is crisp and juicy. Reasonable price which includes soup, main dish, salad, chawanmushi and dessert
Ambience: clean
Service: good and friendly

This is the closest tonkatsu restaurant from where I live, and I go here sometimes. The standout item here is probably the sauce - it's a bit sweeter and fruitier than the other restaurants nearby (Tonkichi, Maison). In terms of overall package though, I'd still prefer to go Maison - the pork there tastes nicer to me, also the rice and tonjiru soup. The seafood options at Maison are also better quality - for example, the oysters. The oysters at Maison are sweet, while the ones I have here are a bit bitter.There's also the breading quality. When I come here, halfway through the meal the breading becomes a big soggy - not a problem that Maison has

Prices on the menu are pretty steep, but what I like about the restaurant is the refillable rice and shredded lettuce. There wasn't a lunch crowd on Saturday, so service was pretty efficient. Ordered their signature Tonkatsu, which was crispy and tasty but too much of its fatty meat. Would return again to try other dishes next time

It was my first time visiting this restaurant when it was at Millenia walk. The food quality was great.This is my second visit and i waited for more than half an hour. The food quality was fabulous. Pork is always good and highly recommended. We ordered the snow crab set with fresh oyster set. The oyster was good but the snow crab was so tiny and not worth the money. Overall the dining experience was great. Staffs were attentive and polite. Highly recommended and will return in future.

Love the tonkatsu here. But If i were to compare it with Tonkatsu Ma Maison in mandarin gallery, obviously tonkatsu ma maison is still the best. However, saboten still serve quite good tonkatsu. Funny, they let you beat the seeds in the bowl first before pouring the souce. Overall i would come again to saboten..

The Tongkatsu is amazing!! Very crispy on the outside and the meat is still tender and moist. The free flow of cabbage is crisp and fresh. Love the idea that u can ground your own sesame seeds. Highly recommend Saboten and will be back again soon!!
