The dim sum that we had by authentic Hong Hong standard was excellent! Really fresh ingredients and great presentation. The quality was unbeatable. On top of that, it was a quiet environment perfect for chilling, with an open view by the ceiling to floor windows.

The restaurant serves really good dimsum at reasonable price. What really blown my family and I away is the great service given by the service staff! Thanks Sky View Pavillion for making my family outing such an enjoyable and memorable one! thumbs up!

We shared Four lovely dishes after the Singapore Flyer.
They were served quickly and were all very well prepared.

With significant trepidation, I decided to try this restaurant out, notwithstanding its location at the Singapore Flyer, which has a funereal pall hanging over the entire complex. First impressions only served to exacerbate my concerns, as we were the only patrons at noon on a Saturday and the restaurant itself could not be described as being anything other than functional. It was an immense relief, therefore, when the food turned out to be more than adequate. We had a selection of dim sum, noodles and a few dishes from the main menu, all of which were of above average standard. Prices were reasonable and service was of course attentive (given the number of patrons). Fortunately, a number of patrons arrived subsequent to us and this helped to liven up the environment somewhat

Ten of us went for a dinner to celebrate a diner's 21st birthday. We asked if there was a complimentary dessert or a small piece of cake. We were told "no". Most of the restaurants we visited will offer some small dessert as a gesture of goodwill.The restaurant was relative empty on a Sunday night. Perhaps the food is not good or too expensive. On the whole, the food was not bad and the price not too expensive. I guess they need to put in more effort in marketing. Most of the food was between average to good. The fired hor fun with egg was excellent. Tim sum is not served at dinner time.Moral of the staff was not great as the restaurant was quite empty. This restaurant is really not bad, One can go earlier and take a walk by the sea side. The view is awesome with the Garden by The Bay and the Marina Bay Sand in front of you

Overall nice place for dim sum with great varieties. However can be a little salty in my personal opinion . We like the soup dumpling, century egg porridge, char siew bun (polo bun style) yam cake.The place is over looking the garden by the bay. Excellent place for family gathering. Plenty of carpark. Relaxing

We came to Sky View Pavilion for dimsum lunch. We arrived past 12 noon as car parking is free at the Singapore Flyer from 12 noon to 2pm on weekdays. During the period we were there, there were 3 occupied tables including ours. This seemed a shame as the quality of dimsum served is good. We reckoned it is a locational challenge since people are mostly in the complex to ride the Singapore Flyer.We have eaten dimsum at Sky View Pavilion a few times and enjoyed the food. We particularly like the pacing and progressive service of dimsum dishes. The restaurant's quiet and unhurried atmosphere is a nice change for a leisurely meal. Serving good quality dimsum despite the slow patronage is commendable when one would expect food quality to dip along with slow lunch covers.As in our previous visits, we walked out to the waterfront (near the restaurant) to enjoy the views of Gardens by the Bay and Singapore skyline after our lunch.We recommend dining at the restaurant

Ordered a couple of dim sum dishes and a XO Mee Pok. The dish that really stood out was the louts leaf rice. Soft, flavourful and well steamed (no grains of rice uncooked). Each dim sum dish is made/steamed to order. However, felt that the portion sizes of the dishes a bit small.

We went to eat with family. Food is good, quite pricey, but that's what you get at tourist spots. What left us a bitter aftertaste was the "complimentary-looking" pickles served without asking and charged S$3 afterwards. Little money, but it still feels bad getting tricked. Maybe it was our first and last time here.
