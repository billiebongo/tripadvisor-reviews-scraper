Got their lunch set for 12 dollars and added a guioza for +3. Like the taste of their signature ramen very much! Itâ€™s worth visiting!

I and my family had lunch there for my hubby birthday. We could choose of the type of the noodles, as well the tenderness.. The broth was rich and tasty.. The waiters were very nice and served us very well. We felt like having lunch at a 5 stars hotel.They'd informed us what we would like/should to know, and they would give us exactly what we were needed, except for birthday candles.. because they really didn't have.. loll!We definitely will come back there again when we visit SG some other time
