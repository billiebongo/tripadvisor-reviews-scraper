Chic place to hang out for a bite and drinks after work. Nice ambience. The food was yum and a good portion.
1
Tonight I visit there. Staff name VERA, she was is rude altitude. Better don’t go this bar. Makes you bad mood.
3
Was there on a business lunch before the crowds come in so the food came in fast. Hence overall good service.
5
The food and desserts were excellent and so was the service. It was not crowded being a Sunday. Also, as it was a weekend, the place has a good play area set up for kids. This ensured that we could enjoy our leisurely lunch without worrying about the kids who were also enjoying themselves
4
Staffs are sharp enough to notice my body language whenever I needed service. Great service and value for money!! Will definitely visit you guys again

Poor communication of male waiter/bartender. Description as follows: DISAPPOINTED in CUSTOMER SERVICE. It was an early Sunday evening at 6pm with only 5 tables worth of customers. Me and my mum sat at a round table at the window side, that had 2 seats. My mum then took an extra chair from an empty table to put her bag. A waitress, after being prompted by another staff came over and apologetically told her that the seats are all reserved for other customers, who've not arrived yet. In addition, we had to sit in a specific direction due to the arrangement/layout of tables and chairs. I was nodding in empathetically, until another waiter (possibly supervisor as he didn't have a tag on), approached us. What ticked me off was the fact that he rolled his eyes as he offered me and my mum to change locations. Not to mention, his expression shouted "C'mon kids, don't make me babysit you ladies, please move to another table if it doesn't suit you." The waitress was nice, but the waiter spoilt my day. What's the point of having nice food when the experience sucks?
1
The food is ok, but I do not feel like coming back again because of their poor service.... I ordered "warm water" but the waitress purposely brought a bottle of water which chargeable and opened the bottle without first asking, and giving me no chance to stop her.. I feel I'm forced to accepting that bottled water. Secondly, despite portraying the place as a baby-friendly eatery, the waitresses showed black faces throughout our entire stay and I don't feel this place as friendly as all.
4
Location was good and service was prompt. Staff were helpful and always with a smile. Overall my colleagues and I had an enjoyable experience at The Bank Bar + Bistro last night
4
The bank bar is a nice restaurant. Kids-friendly. Provide color pencil for kids to keep them busy. Will try to go during weekends for the bouncing castle.
5
Good beer and excellent burger. On a Wednesday night. On the side fries which were ok and a quinoa (yes!) and spinach salad which was a bit overdressed. Burger was well Come here!
3
Came here for lunch this week with a friend. Food is reasonable. Service was fairly efficient, although a little chilly. Cute waitresses in tiny miniskirts. No reservation seems to be required for lunch.
3
It was a little noisy. Food was ok.I thought there would be a kids corner, but only to realise that it is only available on weekends
4
My husband and I went to the bank bar for dinner. He took the half chicken and I opted for vegetarian pasta with pesto verde. The food was very good and the service was fast. We really appreciated the dinner
2
Decent service for a huge lunch crowd. But food quality is really the big issue for the Bank Bar & Bistro
3
Usual gatherings with friends and we decided to do brunch due to conflicting schedule, kids dine free on weekend breakfast was what attracted us and generally an average place.Choice is good for breakfast as well as their full menu but for a place more for drinking and watching soccers, we were skeptical about the food and must say it is.While I would not say the food is bad but nothing that would leave a deep impression on us. The baked eggs that we ordered took a while to come while the rest of my friends have already started on theirs. When it finally came, it is good but not to the point I will come back just for it.Overall the serving is pleasant and service is above average . They do have a play area for kids which is much appreciated
3
We were 8 people and they sat us at a high table with bar stools (with back rests, luckily), but it could have been more comfortable. The menu was Western (salads, pasta, some mains). I had the fish and chips and they were good, but nothing special. It was a busy noontime, but the service could have been faster and they brought out the food at different times, so we ended up not eating together.
3
I've been to Bank a few times and previously my Favourite was always the chicken parmigiana. However to my surprise, they removed it off the menu. I could not imagine why...that was probably their best dish in my opinion. Anyway, tried the pasta and it was very very average. I wouldn't return for the pasta for sure but if they brought the Parma back, that would be a totally different story...
4
My cousin and I had lunch at TBB on a saturday a few week ago. We shared very nice and fresh ceasar salad and and steak & chips. The beer was good and the service was very quick and the price was reasonable. Will do again soon
3
Been to the Bank Bar for lunch a few times and during the most recent visit, I came to the realisation that the waiting staff don't really smile at all. They give the impression that it's a chore serving their customers. At times, I wonder why is the "culture" and attitude towards customers so different from one place to another. I've been to places who absolutely get it right and they make the customers feel warm and welcome. Don't get me wrong, I'm not referring to fine dining places but more the casual dining or cafe/ bar type places. While the food here ain't bad, 99 out of a 100 times I would choose to dine at a place where I feel more welcome.
4
My husband and I wanted to grab a beer and a bite to eat at a fun low key bar. He found bank bar online and we were pleasantly surprised! Has a homey feel, the food was delicious for bar food and the happy hour beers made for a fun afternoon. Would definitely recommend.
4
We had drinks and food. The food was abundant and good. I recommend the fish and chips and their draft beer. It is always packed so arrive early.
4
Bank bar is easy to find.  Short walk from the Raffles place exit J MRT station exit.  Brunch looks good.  Extensive bar menu.Good place for a date or beers with friends.Service is Ok.  The time I went, there was a private event which took over 1/2 the place
4
Great bar, lots of atmosphere could be a bit faster on serving but a fun place anyway. Good stop after lau pau sa
4
I live exactly above this bar and I feel like home every time I go there . Food is nice and tasty and beer is good. Very central location, good to enjoy sport exhibition on TV . They have also a nice small room for the little kids . If you happen to be around the CBD are please stop at the bank 
4
In the heart of the financial district you will find 'The Bank' aptly named of coarse. The menu is of carefully crafted "Pub" food, as tasty as it is enjoyable. Certainly a favourite not only over lunch but from late afternoon into the evening for many
5
Food is great. Love the aglio olio n pair it with erdinger beer.Has always been my hangout place after gymming at asia s
3
So they advertised that 1 kid (4-10 years old) eats for free assuming parents spend $25 on food items, what if parents spend total of $45 on food, and you have 2 kids (1 x 5 year old and 1 x 2 year old), who eats for free? It looks like it is the 5 year old. You end up paying for the 2 year old's meal....which was odd.The portion for the kids meals was really pathetic. Small and insufficient. If you have a 10 year old (and the kids' menu is meant for 4 to 10 year olds), I think they will starve.The kids playroom was tiny, unhygienic and lacking in anything to keep kids' attention for more than 20-30 mins. The equipment has not been updated, they were broken and messy with no one tidying it up after other kids have played in the room.Service by the staff was just very plain and ordinary. No smiles, thanks or anything like that..they behaved as if they rather not be working there on a weekend in the CBD bistro.My view is that the kids' free meal and the kids room angle of advertising is a gimmick. For the price they charge, better off eating at places with nicer tasting food, more generous portions, that look after their guests properly
3
Recommended by some colleagues for a place that feels like an English pub and has good food.The food was below average. Ordered the Angus steak and chicken as mains. For 32 SGD I expect a lot better steak. Sauce tasted as if made from a pack. Vegetable sides were disappointing. Two steamed pieces of broccoli without any seasoning and one cherry tomato. Ordered the Cabernet Merlot on happy hour for 13 dollars for a glass. I've never seen a smaller glass of red wine in my life! Had to order a beer to wash down the disappointment afterwards. Would not recommend going here apart for maybe an after work beer
4
Nice presentation of food and is delicious. Must try Ribs and salmon. Staff service can be further improved as some of them displayed arrogance.
2
The club sandwich was worse than some cold sandwich you can get from 7-11. Thin & hard pieces of grilled chicken. Bacon so overcooked and egg slapped onto some brioche bread (according to the waitress). Looks like a few pieces of plain white bread. Don't bother. Just save money and go to subway.
4
I am a big fan of baby back ribs and the Barbeque Baby Back Ribs served here is so delicious that I had to order another portion to share with a colleague who ordered a burger.
This is a great place for lunch!
4
Good atmosphere, great vibe, mostly banking crowd. Lunch is good as well.
Good place to have drinks after work and it normally crowded on a Friday night. A good place for groups as well.
5
Caught up with some local friends for dinner last night.We had typical western meals...steak, pork and fish & chips - the three of us enjoyed our meals and cool drinks...the atmosphere was lively with a mixture of locals and ex-pats relaxing after work from the nearby commercial complexes.Always enjoy coming here...the staff are friendly and make suggestions from the menu....recommended
3
We had an evening meal here. Beer on tap was very good. The club sandwich was excellent ( husband had the beer and sandwich). Poor choices for gluten free, staff did not offer me many options. This bar/bistro is probably a good after work meeting place
2
My wife and i came here for a breakfast. Althought the place looks nice, the food is not. One of the white egg omlettes we ordered came with two hairs on it. The other dish was eggs benedict, and it was cold. The staff was really friendly and helpful. But this place needs an update in the kitchen ASAP.
4
Was there for a get together with friends, and took advantage of the happy hour offer of S$4 for a glass of sparkling wine. As the bistro is set in the midst of the business district of Singapore, one would expect it to be noisy. The environment is cozy, and where it's located, even if you are seated outdoors, there's always the cool evening breeze. We order a pasta, a pizza and a portion of antipasto for sharing among the 4 of us. It was a good and relaxing mid week. If you are trying to move away from the usual Italian, Korean or Japanese outlets along Tanjong Pagar, this place is good value, at quite affordable prices

Saddened to watch the defeat of #ManchesterUnited to Stoke. Yet at the same time, am thankful that I had gotten to watch the match at The Bank Bar + Bistro. Services were impeccable, both the pulled pork pizza and cheese cake were tantalising to the buds, ambience was cosy. There were other ManU fans around and they would sang some ManU songs to life the spirits in the bar. The entire experience is thumb up :
4
Whilst working in Asia Tower, the Bank Bar seemed like a good place for a fast lunch - an English-style bar, serving a fairly wide range of food. There were balloon and flowers all over the entrance - I think they were celebrating the Bank Bar's anniversary (not sure if it was 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th) as there were lots of messages of goodwill from regular patrons. Nice chilli crab pizza, scrummy barbecued chicken legs, crispy fried wantons and truffled fries made for a good lunch. Thank you. Much appreciated. Good atmosphere too
3
I went there for lunch with my friend in Aug, the pasta was unremarkable. However, the BBQ Pulled pork pizza was delicious. The pizza was crispy with generous pulled pork on it. I went back in late Aug, the Hawaiian pizza and BBQ pulled pork pizza were delicious. Really enjoyed the huge pizza and generous toppings. I strongly recommended this restaurant to my friends. I went backOn 13 Oct and 16 Oct. It was very disappointed that the size of pizza has reduced and the toppings have reduced tremendously too. Gone are the generous portion of pulled pork and chunky pineapples. It was quite embarrassed for me as my group of friends travelled from Jurong/Hougang all the way to The restaurant to try the 'best pizza' as per my recommendation. Hopefully, the management can review and improve the standard ofFood served. I hope the reduction of pizza size/ingredient is not due to the current promotion of UOB 1-1Pizza/pasta.
1
The food they served are so terrible... None of us in the party of four think that our main course past the mark.... I think their focus is on drinks during happy hours..
4
The food was great. We had platters of items which tasted great without high prices.
Alcohol selection was good too for a place in the CBD. Slightly pricey on the drinks though. But overall experience was good.
3
I went here one evening in June on a business trip to the city. Had a few drinks at the bar and watched an F1 Grand Prix which the staff very kindly put on for us. The interior of the place is clean and modern and the drinks priced accordingly for a bar in the CBD with the A/C on full blast. I also had a pasta dish which was extremely unremarkable. WOuld go back again for a drink but not to eat
5
When you go for a typical lunch break you need: good and quick food, a comfortable place to consume it and ideally service (hawker center would do the #1 parameter but struggle with the rest). Don't get me wrong, no comparison with a hawker center - The Bank is a proper restaurant (yes, it works "bistro" if you know the origins of the word). I would build my nest at the place if I'm staying longer. Next time
4
finally got the chance to visit this restaurant for brunch. its been reviewed by food blogs frequently and listed as one of the kid-friendly restaurants. while there's a playground for kids, i don't exactly agree that it deserves the label of a kid-friendly restaurant. firstly, the tables and chairs nearest to the play area are high tables and high stools - suitable for a 5pm drink, surely not for 11am brunch on a saturday. so if you need to sit your brood down, the tables are slightly further away. you won't be able to watch your kids from that area so someone has to accompany them at the play area. theres a tv screen that plays tom and jerry cartoons in the play area. theres a ball pool with slide and some blocks to play. not sure if these are cleaned frequently but my 4 yo did enjoy herself there. had to take turns to watch her tho.overall food was acceptable except the batter for the fish and chips was really salty. one free kids meal with every breakfast meal above $20 ordered. portion for the kids is acceptable for my 4yo but if your kid is a big eater, it won't be sufficient.no one really comes to the bank on weekends i guess, given its location in the office area, therefore the draw of the playground and kids meal. would think twice before going again

This place is located at down town cbd area near Asia squire. If u happen to work in cbd area and stay at a far away place you may not have an incentive to come back all the way to visit places where you go back every weekdays. Wrong- now I at least have an incentive to back for the Sunday roast. One of the best value for money their Sunday roast is at sgd 26.5 - the beef portion is generous and juicy - elegant decoration and exclusive attention since no crowd other than a few families makes it a delightful experience only Yorkshire pudding was not upto the mark but that's forgiven and the only reason to go with 4 stars - highly recommended for weekend visits
2
Went here for a quite drink after food at Lau Pa Sat. The place was about half full and it took me 30 minutes to get a bottle of wine (overpriced). The wine list had different years then was served a pet peeve of mine. Finally, the music they play just doesn't fit the ambiance. Do they think this is a night club
4
I've been going to The Bank ever since it opened and can vouch for both friendliness of the staff and consistency of food and service. It's both business lunch and family friendly though watch out for the evening events - it's a popular venue for company and society events and can be super busy some evenings and service can suffer especially if you are seated outside. So worth checking in advance. The Bank has sports TV which means most of the major events are taken care of... Especially football as the bar manager is a Liverpool fan

The Bank Bar is flanked by glass walls and located in the very heart of the Central Business District (CBD). It is a premium bistro and bar set in a chic, lofty and spacious ambience, tending to executives types for meals, discussions or unwinding.The Bank Bar is furnished beautifully in a modern European decor, making patrons feel right at home immediately in the cushy couches and cosy elegance. *Kelly and I decided to meet up here for lunch on a Friday afternoon.For food, *Kelly decided to go with the The Bank Caesar Salad with Smoked Salmon (SGD$20.50) with romaine lettuce, crispy bacon bites, poached egg, parmesan and black pepper breadstick with citrus Caesar dressing. It was crisp and tasty, a light and healthy dish perfect for lunch. The use of poached egg in lieu of hard-boiled eggs allowed the salad an extra velvety coating of pierced egg yolk.I had the Homemade Beef Pie (SGD$14.00) consisting of a puffy crust containing very generous chunks of beef, which was a delightful surprise. The succulent pieces of beef were juicy and marinated deliciously. It was an absolute delight to find so many pieces of big beef chunks in the pie, and the fries on the side were crispy.We shared a dessert because it sounded irresistable - the Baked Marshmallow (SGD$14.00) with berry compote, sour cream and chocolate ice-cream. It was so gorgeous we could not contain our excitement. I mean, marshmallows are lovely eaten roasted, on their own or with fondue; but baked marshmallow?It was sticky, sweet and chewy, disintegrating lusciously in the mouth. Paired with the creamy chocolate ice-cream and tarty fruits, this was one of the best desserts I have ever eaten. The only drawback was that it was a little messy to eat, we had to twirl and twirl like malt candy. But it was all worth it; I could have eaten an entire one by myself.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to refer to:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/05/lunch-at-bank-bar-bistro-one-shenton.htm

We were in Singapore in time for a good Manchester United match and there is no better place to watch it when in Singapore but in this bar.This is a Man Utd territory LOL. Its a very elite looking bar that serves good food and imported beer. The price can be a bit expensive for a regular Singapore bar but if you are looking for the best , you will really have to spend some dime in Singapore.It just so unfortunate that they had a technical issue with one of the LCD screens when we were there but overall we will come back if given a chance
4
This pub styled restaurant serves a big crowd. It is a lively spot with a good range of choices in the menu. I had a great Thai chicken salad, while my colleagues had a caeser salad with chicken, fish and chips, lamb shank and mash as well as cod. All dishes were excellent. Service was quick and friendly. Fun place in a bustling part of town
5
Had not been for a good while
Still a Nice buzzing after work bar and bistro nice food reasonable prices for CBD
4
Service was tops, food was good although I suggest they provide refillable coffee during breakfasts. Place has a children's play area for toddlers, kids eat for free when you order adult mains.
4
The location for the officer. The lunch was so yummy. Pizza and Chicken wings are superb! It's quite far from Mrt and no restaurant around the bank bar. Most of the customer are regular guest not tourist. The ambience was comfortable and nice decoration. Service just ok. The price is reasonable and value for money.
4
Many times, I have driven past The Bank Bar & Bistro on my way to meetings at Shenton Way. I was surprised they have a 'Children Dine Free' menu when last Sunday, my friends suggested a restaurant for our 'annual' get-together and suggested to visit this restaurant.On Sundays, the restaurant serves all-day breakfast, from morning till 6pm. The restaurant converts a private room into a play area, with cartoon screenings and toys to keep the children entertained while the adults can dine without worrying about the kids.My family ordered:- Roast Beef with roasted potatoes and greens: Two slices of beef- Eggs Benedict with Parma Ham: The hollandse sauce couldn't have packed more 'oomph', otherwise the dish was alright. - Fish and chips (Children's menu): Good for 1 kid. Qulity was not bad and the kids enjoyed it.Good value for money!I highly recommend this place for parents with children who are looking for a nice restaurant to dine and a place where they can park their children while they have their meals
5
What a fantastic evening. The atmosphere was perfect for all the Hairy sailers attending the pre Christmas get together. The Mount Gay Rum cocktails got the evening off to fine start with the mini burgers, crispy Pork Belly and other finger foods filling the holes. Tell the truth, I was sad to leave. Will be back as soon as possible to experience the menu properly.
2
So, we decided to try this place for dinner, all I can say is that we won't be coming back. The fish & chips and pork chops were not too bad, cant say the same for the mushroom soup and service. We ordered a bowl of forest mushroom soup with truffle oil to share, I nearly regurgitate it back into my mouth. It's the most horrible mushroom soup, heck, most horrible soup, I have ever tasted! It was like water. Complained to one of the server and she offered to change it to a new one for us, saw her brought it to the kitchen, and then bringing it out again, I supposed the chefs must have refused to cook a new bowl. She brought it to another colleague whose name tag says "Mesmerizing Mary", who is far from mesmerizing, if anything, she should just be "Manner-less Mary". She brought the soup back to us and told us that it taste funny because of the truffle oil, as if we don't know how truffle oil tastes like. She insisted that the soup is supposed to taste this way without even tasting it, but I spoke too soon because eventually she gave this exasperated look and walked 3 meters away towards the bar, took a spoon and dipped into the bowl of water they tried calling mushroom soup, tried it and walked back to us saying that the soup is perfectly fine and it's supposed to taste like this. She did the unthinkable, she returned the same soup bowl onto our table!! Prior to this, Manner-less Mary even threw the coasters onto the table instead of settling them down nicely. Yes I know it's peak hour, the restaurant is busy, but if she does not know how to manage and balance her time, then this industry is not suitable for her. I used to be from this industry too, which is why I know being polite and service oriented even during peak hours is not an impossible thing to do. Perhaps Manner-less Mary should learn a thing or two from her other colleagues.
4
Went to lunch here prior to a local meeting.Not full at 1pm which surprised us, and we found a table fairly easily.Prices seemed reasonable, and it's one of the increasingly few places that will serve you a burger cooked the way you want it, rather than burnt to a cinder. Lovely!!The service was efficient as you would expect for a business-linch style bar, and I have to say that generally, we were surprised it wasn't busier as the quality, price and service should result in it being jammed. Perhaps that was because if was Tuesday.I will definitely return, as it's near many insurance companies who are clients, and its a very pleasant atmosphere
5
I was looking for excellent breakfast place on Sunday hoping that can also accommodate the kids. This place is no doubt my best option. Kids eat for free from kids menu on Saturday and Sunday till 6pm for every mains order by an adult. Plus the playroom is just enough to occupy the kids and burn off their "well" endless energy. The mini burgers for kids are excellent and I personally love the pancakes. Good service too. Will be back again
3
Went early to have dinner and watch the opening match between MU vs Swan. Managed to get a table by the corner and was assured by the waiter that they'll change the ruby match once the MU starts. But, when the match started, the ruby match still continue with only one couple watching - this is nonsense. This is supposed to be a MU pub, but watching ruby match!!!! At the other corner of the pub, they're promoting MU membership - this is ridiculous and wasting my time visiting the pub to support MU!!!
4
Excellent location, opposite SGX Centre in Shenton Way. Good place to hang out for after office hour drinks. Had there lunch a couple of times, tastes good, nice variety and no issues with quality of ingredients used.Good place to hangout with colleagues for quick drinks
4
Relaxed and uncomplicated. Reasonable food at sensible prices. Nice place to sit outside in the evening and watch the world go buy (if traffic noise is not an issue)
3
I have been here 3 times, the first and third times on my own for a quick breakfast before hitting the gym next door. Both times there were many waitresses standing around, they either really ALL didn't notice someone standing at the door for awhile waiting to be seated or noticed but decided one person is not worth their time. And the weirdest thing is when the guy at the bar preparing drinks finally noticed me and got one of the waitresses to go attend to me, both times the waitresses would go "yes?" Come on, you are a restaurant, OBVIOUSLY I am here to eat and need a table!! What ELSE would I want!??! Food is not bad, except that today the croissant is hard. Coffee is good. So just need to work on manners of service staff. Thank

We had our son's first year birthday party at The Bank Bar & Bistro last weekend and it was terrific! From the planning to execution stage,it was fuss-free and very easy. Evangeline assisted with putting together the event order and the team on-site led by Vincent were fantastic and attentive - prompt to provide assistance and replenish the buffet line.Not your typical venue for a children's party but with some colorful balloons, it made for a nice, spacious event venue, coupled with good finger foods and service.The plus side is that on the weekends, they convert to a family-friendly brunch venue with their private dining room decked out with ball pits, slides, toys and a TV with cartoons for the kids!What a brilliant idea and it worked so well for all the kids at our party!Thanks to the team and we look forward to returning soon
4
We visited here for the first time on fathers day. It is a good bar bistro venue. The inside is big enough to be comfortable, but small enough to feel special. The value of the meals and drinks is very good. My sandwich was a BLT, which was slightly too small for a grown man, but very tasty. My wife had the sunday lunch special, which was beef, very good, only required more potatoes, which she requested. Unfortunately they turned up after she had completed her meal, but overall we were pleased
5
Held a party here for my daughter. The atmosphere was relaxed, spacious and bright. Servers were friendly, helpful and accommodating. They even helped to pay first for the birthday cake that was delivered early. The best part of the place was that there is a kids room with a tv showing cartoons, a small slide with ball pool, cars, blocks etc to entertain the kiddos and give babies space to crawl.Food portions were small so we ran out of food. The food was decent, nothing gourmet but good enough for me. The wings and sliders were very well received. It is the ideal place for parents who wanna pretend for just perhaps a half hour that they are carefree and single again in a bar while their kids are in the room next to you. Perfect
5
We had our son's 3rd birthday and daughter's full month party held together at the Bank. We selected the food package catered to a kid's party and it was tasty and looked great. The service staff was excellent. They took care of our guests' (60 people) needs and we were able to host the party with ease. The playroom for kids was a plus as we were able to enjoy the event knowing the children were in a safe environment. Overall, superb experience and will definitely visit the Bank again
4
I arranged for a surprise birthday party for my wife and catered a buffet menu that suited adults and kids. The food included tomato sauce and chicken pasta, mini burgers, Caesar salad, sausages, etc. Kid-type food (as we had quite a few children present) but most of which was of reasonable quality for the adults. Loved the beers, myself!One selling point was the kids' playroom with equipment and a ball pit. My daughter declared this the best party ever thanks to the playroom. This let the kids enjoy themselves while the adults got some Time to themselves outside.I really liked the attentive service and this helped me to enjoy the party myself. Parking was cheap and convenient for such a location as we went on a Saturday evening
5
We have had a private family event at the Bank.It is a surprising place for all of us, the ambiance and service was fantastic!As an event location, they have the best follow up and follow through of plans amongst all the event places we have considered. From their Head of Marketing to their service staff, they really made us feel like a family event. It was well planned and well executed.Thank you

Pretty good bar/restaurant for lunch in the Raffles Place/Shenton commercial district just opposite Lau Pa Sat. Lunch menu is good, pizza was very well prepared and presented, value was typical Singapore pricing but still respectable
2
Went here for lunch at 3pm. Empty at that time and we hoped that service would be better than typically what you receive in SG. Unfortunately 2 orders out of 5 were incorrectly provided for and one of them actually had HAIR in the food!! Yes, hair. Upon asking the waitress to inform the manager there was no response from the Manager who was just across our table behind the bar. Not only was the good delivered not what we ordered but also it took 20-30 minutes for each order. Really horrible. When I spoke to the manager regarding the hair in the food he answered saying noted and have informed the chef!! His attitude said everything. Seriously he may as well have said I don't care and eat what you get! Nothing more to say about this place except rethink before going there. Not worth it unless you want to talk to a stupid customer service manager who doesn't know how to treat people with respect.
