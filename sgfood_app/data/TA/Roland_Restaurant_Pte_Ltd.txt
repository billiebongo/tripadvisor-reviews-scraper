This had been our best restaurant since in the seventies. Although decorations of restaurant looks old but the food is marvelous. It's best that you make reservations as sometimes the restaurant is fi

Recommend must eat the Hor Fun or its the noodle with a bit sticky soup with seafood and egg....its really yummy and also dim sum all menu are good.....the last order that they accept is 2 pm...recommend to go around 1.30 pm because its very crowded and must book table

We‚Äôre here for dinner. I was told that this place is the first one which introduce the famous Singapore Chili Crab. I had the chili crab and it was very delicious. The clay pot shark-fin soup also very nice. Service also very good here. The crab dinner was not as expensive as in other places too. Quite a good deal I must say.

We booked a group of 20 people and organize the menu in advance (one of their set menus). Food was outstanding. They were about seven different plates. One after the other were succulent and were surprising our palates. Their reputation is based on their recipe of Chili Crab and it is a delicacy. It is also delicate to eat as several guest splashed sauce on their nice shirts. After the fact, service provided special food protector around the neck but it was just to late. The only flaw of the evening plus the very long delay between the first and second plat

Coming to Roland will always give me the impression of how I am ripped off at other seafood place. A good 900g signature Chili crab, a salted egg yolk prawns, crispy mini squid, yam with scallop, dessert, tea, soft drinks, pickles etc costs me only S$145. Whereas a crab "somewhere famous" would already be $100+! Chili crab is really good here, unlike the taste outside. Its really unique, thick, filling and tasty. Crab is fresh and meat slide off the shell. Service is attentive, granted that the restaurant was quite empty on a weekday night. The wait staff was free enough to make small jokes and help take pictures. Nothing to fault, except the restaurant is rather old, air-con drafty etc. But hey, you are here to eat food, not to eat the tattered and torn carpet right? So its still a 5 star experience to me.A trye and real seafood restaurant that I hope will withstand time

Walking into this restaurant was like entering the 80s. The deco must not have changed much since then but it mattered little as I had the best chili crab in Singapore!! It had just enough heat, thick and not too sweet. While the chili crab was fantastic, I cannot say the same about the spinach and bamboo clams. Correction, I think the bamboo clams were lousy. They were swimming in copious amounts of oyster sauce! I give this place a 4/5 because of the great chili crab

Having department dinner over there. It is quiet this night maybe due to working day. We are being placed in the private room for 3 tables and karaoke for entertainment.

The host was lovely, took our picture there. The staff could be secret agents as they were wired up with earpieces to the central control agency.... they brought our food promptly and omg it was amazing. The Singapore chilli crab was superb. We had sweet bread rolls to dip all the beautiful juices! The cereal prawns were amazing! The vegetable dish of steamed greens was top class - forgot the name but just order. If the staff were happy, we‚Äôd vote this 5 stars! We took our Singaporean expats there, and will return. Message ends

The place was recommended by Grand Mercure Hotel concierge as it was short walking distance.We had heard a lot of Singapore Chilli Crab but never tried it before.The restaurant provided us with "Bibs" and some guidance, its a bit messy to eat for first timers. The crab we were told weighed about 800 gms and is enough for up to four people.The thick chilli sauce had the right colour and balance. The meat was tastyand well worth soiling our hands.The dish for was large,for two of us to finish it all. Believe Roland were the first to introduce the dish in 1956
4
They are the creator of this famous singapore dish: chilli crab. I like that their chilli paste is not too sweet like most of the shops out there. the crabs are not over priced like some other restaurants. Service is pretty good too, will come back here over and over again
3
Tried their signature dish - chilli crab. So so..But Classic Crispy Duck - nice.
Their services need to improve, their attitudes aggressive.
4
We had dinner for 8 pax . Food reasonably good . Price mid range . Service excellent . We had set dinner for 6 pax n ordered extra dishes . The steam soon hock n crab noodles were excellent .
3
This place is very popular with their loyal clients...
No much ambience to talk about. Service is so so.
Prices are very reasonable for the food they served.

Tricky to find (Level 6) of a car park, however a great local tip. Amazing dim sum and excellent Roland Chilli Crab. Can't wait to go back!
4
Seafood is very tasty, i love it.
Recommended for butter crab (deep fried & stir fried with salty egg yoek.
5
I had been triying to find a good chilli crab restaurant ant this was it. At the 6th floor of a car park in a big spacious restaurant under the controling eye of the owner they are serving really tasty chilli crab. 800 gr. crab for 2 person is satisfying (55 Sin.dollars). We also tried crispy fried noodles with prawns, and crispy baby squid which were also very tasty. Take extra paper towels with you.
5
The chili crabs are excellent! Though if you prefer the more salty and flavorful sauce from Jumbo, you might not like this. Personally I find the taste great since it does not over power the freshness and sweetness of the crabs. Interestingly we ordered the crab bee hoon and find the taste even better than others we have tried before! Highly recommended! The fried fritter sotong (you tiao) was good too! There are many tables available and was relatively crowded on a Sunday evening, reservations are still recommended. Service staff are friendly and attentive despite the crowds. Corkage fees are $15 per bottle of red or white wine. No corkage fees for hard liquor. Parking is available at the HDB multi-storey carpark, near to Marine Parade NTUC Finest.

My wife and I enjoyed a very delicious meal this evening at Roland Chili Crab Restaurant. We are not Chili Crab fans but the Cod, the Broccoli with garlic, and a fabulous bean-curd dish was all very satisfying. We will definitely be back on our next visit to Singapore!
5
A friend recommended this restaurant where the chilli crab is made to the original recipe by the original family, and we were not disappointed! The service was friendly and prompt, the food was amazing and the prices very reasonable compared to our disappointing visit to Boat Quay the previous night. We had the house specialities of chilli crab, crispy fried squid and prawns in black sauce, and we could not decide which was best. Definitely recommend a visit...yum, yum, yum
5
Their Chilli Crab is incredible. As a matter of fact everything was. We also ordered the Sambal Kang Kong and the crispy squid. Roland is the son of Cher Yam Tian and Lim Choon Ngee founders of the famous Chilli Crab and amazing sauce. They started their seafood restaurant in 1956 along the Kallang River. A word of warning - frigging hard to find but OMG amazing and sooo worth it
4
This is a restaurant that's gives a-family get together atmosphere . Tables arranged majority are for 8-10 groups It is also good. for get-together functions

The bust chili crab and sated egg crab in Singapore the food is marvellous üëçüëçüëç
The boss was very friendly and helpful the staff services was good mast try you wouldn't regret

We had a 2 night stopover in Singapore and it was recommended to us from a mate in Brisbane before we left to try this restaurant. We were not disappointed. The service was great, food was wonderful, especially the Singapore Chilli Crab. We tried at least 4 dishes, all were very good. There were 4 of us for dinner and the food was plentiful. If I was ever in Singapore again, I would return and also recommend it

We had some family members from Indonesia in town. Decided to have dinner in the East, close to their accommodation. Wanted to have dinner at a well-known restaurant in Parkway Parade but they do not accept reservations. We managed to make a reservation instead at Roland Restaurant, a restaurant that has been around since 1956 and billed as the founder of the popular chili crab. A group of 8, we ordered the set dinner for 6 pax and topped up with another dish. Portions were very reasonable which could also be cos most of us were not big eaters. We even had left over food which we packed to bring home. Food was good. Prices reasonable for restaurant standard. We especially loved the steamed fruit fish which looked like a cat fish to us. The flesh was soft and tender and not too many bones.
5
Some business colleagues from singapore took me to this restaurant. Nice place. Many large family and business groups dining here. had the crunchy fried baby squid to start. very good and unusual dish was sweet and spicy. Then came the frogs legs in wine sauce. First time eating this. was tasty but other dishes were better. then came the chili crab and pepper crab. the chili crab was great!!! Order the fried buns to soak up the sauce with. Not too spicy at all but sooo good. Messy as heck but was great!!! Would go again in a heartbeat!!
5
Booked a room on a Monday for 10 recently for a family dinner.Bill need to reach S$600 to have a room. We ordered the S$538 set and ordered a few more items to hit S$600.I have been doing it yearly to welcome a family member back to Singapore.The manual seems does not change much but the food was good.The portion was small for 10 person.oh. Sometime nearby churches use the restaurant to hold events and the noise could be to loud and affects your dinning. Good to call if you want to avoid it

While most of visitors focus on the few seafood restaurants in the downtown area, this restaurant offers a more local community style version of it. The good news is the owners are good English speakers and are actively involved in the customer service daily. This restaurant is popular in the local community and has been in the same location for a long time. The setting is typically local community Chinese style .. relatively no frills. The typical seafood like chilli or pepper crabs, cornflakes prawns tasted similar to those in town but (good new is) it is a lot cheaper. value for money.But I enjoyed was exactly the broad rice noodles (hor fun) most. It has a strong aroma of well cooked and flipped noodles in a wok powered by very high temperature fire After trying out seafood in various place, I think good seafood cooking skills has become so prevalent in Singapore that the deviation from one restaurant to another is marginal like chicken rice or nasi padang or bak kut these days. So my suggestion is that for those who want to venture out into the local communities in Singapore and try seafood and not pay a hefty price for it. Roland would be a decent choice.Ignore what is written on the advertisement. Overall, every seafood restaurant claims to be the best and original. the rest is a matter of preference, convenience and service
2
The food is average at best. The small serving chilli crab cost $54++ is not up to standard. A few pieces of the crab were not fresh while the rest were. I suspect that all the pieces did not come from one crab. The dish came out of the kitchen within a minute of our order, before the waitress taking our order even turned her head away! That was extremely quick service, faster than fast food!The seafood hor fun had too much gravy that, for a moment we thought it was kway Teow soup!! It had too much sugar and MSG in it!The orh nee had corn syrup on it! While there was some real mashed yam in it, the bowl tasted more like sweetened yam paste than orh nee. The ginko nuts looked too tired!For the bill of $125.70 for 3 persons here, we could have had much better food, service and ambience elsewhere topping it up a bit more!! Tonight when we were here, it was extremely noisy especially with a function going on behind our table.We came to try our this restaurant as my daughter wanted a "different " place! The moral of the story is: try to stick to the known
3
I went here because it is supposed to provide the most authentic version of spicy crab. As others have said, the food is excellent. Also as others have said the service is questionable. The staff seemed to have all started work the day we visited. They were unfamiliar with the menu, did not know how to serve the dishes, and managed to spill both tea and food over the table. While the food is not particularly expensive, there must be better experiences. I would recommend going elsewhere.The location is not near metro so we had to take a cab
4
restaurant needs a revamp feels like 1980s, service levels varies by staff but the food is awesome. my years of chomping on chilli crabs have concluded this is the best in sgp but people who can't take spicy might want to ask for lighter version. 3 eggs spinach was the best I hv eaten too.despite the decor, I'll be back for more
3
Brought visitors to experience the original Singapore chilli crab at Roland's. Was struck by the expanse of the restaurant space and pleasant staff, food was average and not memorable.
5
The place is located at the top of a parking place, looks a little old, but ate the best chili crab so far found during my stay in Singapore.
4
A lot of history written about how the chili crab was invented in this place and it did not disappoint! The chili crab was one of the best if not the best I have ever tried in Singapore!
4
Great to try the original Chilli crab in Singapore. Food is very good and well proportioned. We went for the 4 person set meal which was just the right amount of food. Food came out a little too quickly would be my only less positive feedbac
5
Celebrated Mother's Day here with my family, total 10 people. Restaurant was full but the service remained great. Food was served promptly, fresh and piping hot. The servers are courteous and helpful. Prices for set menu are reasonable. We even saw the boss personally helping out and directing guests to their tables. To lead is to serve, no wonder his staff are all so engaged and energetic
4
Just finished up a business dinner here. The people I was with ordered the food so I might get the names wrong. The first thing we had was a dish of baby octopus with cakue stuffed with minced octopus. It was delicious. The other dishes we had were kangkung (morning glory/water spinach) with spicy dried shrimp, pork ribs, steamed live shrimp, shrimp in a kind of sweet soy sauce, Singaporean style mie goreng (fried noodles) and chili crab. I was told this place is the originator of chili crab and while I can't confirm that what I can confirm is that the chili crab is deliciously amazing. The fried mantau is a perfect accompaniment, letting you scoop up that mouth watering sauce. I would definitely recommend going here.
3
Wanted to try the push cart dim sum on a Sunday morning. Restaurant wasn't crowded. Service was not up to expected. The push cart never come to our table. Limited items available as well compared to other push cart restaurant like SwaTow. Don't think I'll be back again soon. Prices are higher and cheapest item was priced $3.20.
5
Brought some overseas friends to try out Singapore's famous chilli crab. We were not disappointed. Our other dishes like black pepper crab, pumpkin prawns, 3 eggs spinach and crispy squids were a delight to everyone.To my surprise, the place was not as crowded as I expected. So it was perfect for us to catch up with one another.The one thing that marred a great meal was the tang yuan which was the worst I have ever eaten. Would have given an Excellent rating if not for this fail
5
Roland's is our go-to place in the East Coast for seafood as well as other popular Chinese restaurant dishes. On our last visit which was a birthday dinner, our guests were particularly impressed with the birthday buns, the lobster starter and the chicken cooked two-ways. The salt-egg crab is also to DIE-FOR! Prices are reasonable and the place is comfortable for family dinners yet good enough to throw lavish parties. The restaurants has small and large private rooms. Advisable to always make reservations. The place can be packed even on week nights. Oh I must add that parking is no problem at all as it is situated on the 6th floor of a multi-storey carpark. You can drive straight up if you don't want to take the lift
5
Just had a lovely dinner at Roland's. Kang Kong with garlic, drunk'n prawns, Crispy duck pancakes, pork ribs and chilli crab all amazing, followed by mango pudding...yum!Lovely waitress served us and as English was not her strongest, gave me the docket to read and check before putting the order through. She was very attentive and helpful, giving us fresh plates and constant supply of tea and water. Finding the restaurant was a bit tricky. It's on the 6th floor over the parking lot but worth looking for.
5
S$500+ bill for dinner. Not even a ten course dinner. This is the standard price. Food especially the chili crabs is one of the best in Singapore. Crispy squib, fried mantou, fried prawn youtiao, sambal kangkong... We had the desserts- mango pudding. Good but pricey.
5
Had my first Chinese New Lunch this year at Roland. Yusheng still the best. USA duck and Yam ring are delicious too.
4
Has been to this restaurant for management gathering. Nice place with good food - Chili Crab, Prawn and steam fish. Food consider quite tasty and good place to celebrate with family. This restaurant has private dining area with Karaoke system. Easy to find and it is located at East Coast Central area, Singapore
4
We went on a week night so the restaurant was not busy and service was attentive. Roland's mother was the first to invent chilly crab, and my friend has been saying it is a must-try. The chilly crab was indeed outstanding, and compared with the others, had a more of a homey taste, I was told all the flavoring is still being done by the family, and they keep it at one branch only to maintain the standard, Definitely worth it. In addition to the crab, the herbal drunken prawns and duck were also excellent, The only disappointment was the Chinese New Year Yu Sheng (salad), which other have mentioned already, Happy to have another go-to chilly crab place
2
Came here for our reunion dinner so we did expect it to be crowed and service to be a little slower.Our family does understand that there is specific seating time due to the high season however serving ALL 8 dishes in 30 mins was definitely NOT what we expected of this place. The seating allocation was for 2 hours serving everything in an hour to an hour and a half would be expected but 30mins definitely made it a horrible experience. Food was average. Had to send a fair few dishes back as it was served warm as the food came out too fast. Won't be back
3
First time to the restaurant , all tables were filled up. Food are average , Yu Sheng is not the best guess too much sauce. Services can't expect too much from them cause it was really too crowded . The staff were not attentive . Hope to try the chili crab next time

After living in Singapore for 13 years, I was looking forward to going to the place that originally created "Chili Crab".Ambiance is identical to a large dim sum hall in Hong Kong, staff insist on sitting guests around the waiter stand so they can socialize with each other without being too far from the tables. And to really show their laziness, the boiled peanuts had obviously been out for a very very very long time as the top ones where dried out - hence we had sent a plate back before even beginning.Staple dishes like Kankong, fried baby squid, scallop in yam were all 5/10.The Chili Crab (baring in mind supposedly the original) was more like a glutinous Tom Yum sauce with egg than that of the many mainstream places, and still very tasty. The crab was cooked perfectly, this was truly appreciated given the amount of crab places in Singapore that overcook crab, it was a pleasant dish.Unfortunately we thought we would try the crispy duck, nothing on it was crispy - it tasted 2 days old, chewy, and almost no flavor.For 4 of us it cost SGD185, so price wise OK, but I would rather top up 20% and go somewhere with better food and service with a view
5
We had wanted to do chili crab since we got to Singapore. Many recommended Jumbo and No Signboard but frankly those two are too expensive for my budget. We are so glad we found this restaurant!This is a classic Chinese restaurant. Servers are very attentive and helpful. We ordered 5 dishes for 5 of us. The fried scallop started us off very well. Usually these type of fired food will be very oily but they have done it well.The chicken and the squid is normal and up to expectation. The chili crab though, is THE BEST. The crab meat is tender but the sauce is great! We basically started eating the sauce after the crab was gone - with the mantou's that came with the crab and without. If they sell the sauce in a can we will definitely buy that!I have never been to other places for chili crab but I would say I am happy with the version by Roland and will definitely come back whenever I am in Singapore
4
I've been a great fan of the Chilli Crab since I first tried it out at Jumbos in Singapore. Having read in a few blogs about how the famed Chilli Crab traced its origins to Rolands' mom, we decided to head to Rolands in Marine Parade and give it a shot. We weren't disappointed! The gravy was superb, the crab meat was succelent, and the portions were large. Left the place with a big smile, a not too large bill and with the intention of heading back soon
5
The original inventor of the Chilli crab.My family of 5 enjoyed it. Besides the Chilli crab, we also ordered pepper beef, honey glazed ribs, beancurd, vegetable, dessert (mango pudding/pomelo sago/yam paste - individual bowls). also includes rice, tea, peanuts, & even bought a bottle of their famous chilli sauce, only $175.55 in total
5
Can life get better than chilli crab and tiger beer? Best I have ever had and with 800 gm of crab I did not go away hungary.
5
This is not a cheap restaurant, but the quality is superb. We had crisp Fried Baby Sqid - delicious. 1/2 a duck (as good as in Beijing). 1 Crab - the sauce was superb. This would have been enough for 3, we were only 2
3
I had lunch at this restaurant with a group of about sixty persons. The restaurant was chosen for its popularity and its strategic location. On the whole, the menu chosen were great and the chili crab was outstanding. Everyone loves it. The atmosphere was conducive to family and group meals and the service was efficient. The only weakness I observe is the access to this restaurant at the upper floor with only one lift available and shared with a supermarket and other tenants.
4
My family went there to celebrate my mother's birthday in late May 2015. We had 2 tables and set menu for dinner.While waiting for everyone to turn up, we asked a waitress whether the kitchen uses peanut oil as 2 of my children have peanut allergy. She referred us to a captain (wore a suit/jacket) who was very sure that peanut oil is used. He even recount an incident where a diner had allergy reaction after eating some food! Hence, we were advised to buy food from nearby hawker centre for our children.After about 20 to 30 min later, my brother-in-law came to know about it and asked the manager. The manager was rather sure no peanut oil was used. However, after we quoted the captain, he went into the kitchen to verify with the chefs. It turned out that only vegetable oil is used.By this time, we had bought 2 packets of food from the hawker centre for our children. The captain could have taken the initiative to verify with his manager or chefs.If this incident had not happened, our experience at the restaurant would have been better. The food was quite tasty
4
The Mother of all chili crabs, I just had to give it a try. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had, but it is definitely one of the best! Their gravy is known to be more tomato-based. I like how I could just drink up the gravy, though I thought it was a bit too bland for the crab. The crab was definitely very fresh. The stir-fry frog with spring onions is pretty good as well. Their pricing is more towards the high side (esp the crab), so will only come here on special occasions
2
Highly recommended by a local produced television program aired on Sunday via CNA; and made a reservation for dinner that very day; but ended up with disappointment. Did not expect much service but it was rather bad! Expected great dishes as they were Roland's family recipes but majorly disappointed! Had better black sauce prawns and yam ring, elsewhere. Worst, we sat down at 8pm and was told that crabs were sold out! So much for a restaurant that were famous for crabs. Really crab
3
Frankly, just average! From the service (given a small table for 8 even though reservation was made); and the food (truly over-rated - not worth to go again)! Two of the signature dishes were major let down - the "black sauce prawns" was salty; the soup-based for the "crab bee-hoon soup" was not rich enough. And, the custard pancake was obviously a wrong combination!However, we did enjoy the authentic roasted chicken; the fried yam mini scallops; and the yam paste with ginko nuts. Frankly, they need to do more to attract new diners

Where to get good chili crabs??? Whenever family members or friends ask us about Chili Crabs, we'll unanimously agree - Roland! We love bringing our families here to satisfy our crab cravings. Because it's that good, we'll usually call in advance to make a reservation and let them know what we'll order to ensure we have the seafood we ordered. Despite the location, my family will drive all the way/take public transport to the East to have our feast. What we enjoy and usually order? Chili crab, Crab with Bee Hoon soup (my mother-in-law loves this), fried mantous, fried soon hock (my dad loves this), crispy baby squid, clams, homemade tofu and spinach with egg 3-ways. Their pork ribs are good too - soft and succulent! What we appreciate? The friendly and efficient staff. You'll usually find the boss and his son at work during weekends. This shows their dedication to their business and customers. One of our crabs did not arrive even came after we finished our dinner and so we alerted the boss, who personally went to the kitchen to check! He came back to our table to see if everything was alright. Good service even from their elderly staff - they are always happy to take our family photos after a good meal. I'll definitely recommend Roland to anyone who is looking for good and reasonably priced crabs :D Looking forward to my next visit

Family and I frequent this place for its chili crabs. One of the best in Singapore IMO. Tend to be sweet which suites my taste buds. Typical neighbourhood restaurant with average ambiance and service. Convenient location too. Overall, fuss-free nicely priced dinner. Excellent for family outings
4
This is my 3rd time in Roland and the impression is much better than beforeFood quality - good and freshChili crab at SGD60 per kg is reasonable. The gravy is good with fried bun(mantou)Service - goodAmbience - it was a weekday hence less crowd - very goodGenerally it is a good choice if you happen to be in Marine Parade area and also a break from all the big names. It is a place I am happy to recommend. tips : if you adore crab roe - go for female crab and if you prefer meaty crab - go for male crabDo not hesitate to ask level of spiciness to be adjusted for your chili cra
4
A little far off, but with a vast selection of seafood and a good atmosphere to match, with local Singaporean seafood specialities. Come hungry!
4
Serves good food with reasonable price, though we happened to visit during CNY period, service was good, and quality of food well maintained, will surely come back again.
4
When u don't mind the actual restaurant surroundings & only care about the food, I suggest to go & try this place. The building is quite old & from the outside, furniture inside the restaurant screams 80's Chinese restaurant kind of aura. However, the food is really good. Chilli crab & fried mantau are highly recommended! Squid with salt & pepper was also delicious, and so were the salted egg prawns. Price is very reasonable. Shared 2 types of crab menus, squid & prawn, fried rice & had plenty of beer with 3 other friends and we spent around SGD 200
3
Cons:Chilli crab that did not taste very good. This is of course a response preference but I believe the creator of a dish doesn't mean it stays the best. The restaurant was obviously struggling to cope with a near full house because it was difficult to get the attention of an order taker plus the food took a long time to arrive. A sambal mussel dish we ordered was undercooked and tasted pretty nasty. The rest of the dishes did not leave a positive impression. The room temperature in the restaurant was also on the high side and I was quite uncomfortable throughout the meal. Pros:An elderly lady who served us was great. She was attentive to the best of her ability to do so in spite of the chaos within the restaurant. She is the reason I'm giving 3 points instead of 2. I don't think I will be returning to the restaurant again.

This restaurant may be the pioneer of chilli crabs in Singapore, but it is most definitely not the best. However, its warm customer service, with its other great dishes make it a worthy place to visit for a nice family meal. 1) Chilli crab (8/10)- Was served warm, but not piping hot as it should be- Mantous (buns) were crispy, just at the right texture- We ordered the male ones, which have more meat but no roe - Crabs were decently sized, but the restaurant did not seem to have an option for bigger crabs? Unsure of this. 2) Black pepper crab (8.5/10)- Was served warm, but not piping hot, as above.- The paste was better than the chilli crab - new crab lovers might find it good, but there are better ones! 3) Black soy sauce prawns- The prawns are sort of BBQ-ed and then served with a mysteriously delicious black sauce that will get you crawling back for more- The entire plate was scraped clean of sauce by the end of our meal! - MUST-TRYThis is a good place for families as the space is huge for young infants and kids to run around and expend their energy. The staff is friendly and willing to introduce their menu, and serve whenever possible. It is located at the top floor of a multi-storey carpark - the most peculiar place for a restaurant of its standard, but is most definitely worth a weekend visit for a demanding palate

Had dinner there on 13 June 2014. 4 adults with 2 children. We did not order the crabs . We hadFish maw soup, 3 eggs vegetables, sambas sweet potato leaves, special Wuxi pork ribs with mantou, soy sauce prawns and roast chicken. All well executed. Not salty too.Prawns were fresh , big and full of roe. Total cost abt $200 plus. Staff were efficient and attentive . Recommended

Attended a birthday dinner last evening.This was in a private roomThe menu was well chosen by our hosts....colddish platter, sharkfin soup,mushrooms with seacucumbers, steamed fish, chilli crab plus salted eggcrab, longevity bee hoon & orh nee in a hollowed pumpkinWe liked most of the dishes though the bee hoon was notwell liked.The orh nee in the pumpkin was well done, more liquid & lesscloying then the traditional mash you are served.The waitresses were attentive in topping up our tea & drinks withoutprompting & in changing cockery

It was our aunt's 94th birthday and we decided to bring her out for a birthday lunch. After all, how many of us will live to such a ripe old age? :)We decided to go to Roland Restaurant as it had been some time since we last dined there.We ordered the fish maw soup, Sambal Kang kong(vegetable dish), scallop in yam basket, almond prawns, golden tofu and longevity noodle. The scallop in yam basket reminds one of the huge yam basket with cashew nuts and vegetables in the centre. However this was a mini version of that with scallop in the centre. Interesting!The almond prawns was another hot favorite especially with the cereal like almond. At lunch on a weekday, the restaurant was pretty empty so service was prompt. We did not order the ever popular chilli crabs as a few of us had to rush back to the office. So we'll definitely be back for more..

It was a Saturday night, and a business associate from Japan was in town. Hence the choice of Roland near to where we live for dinner with family and him.Every dish was michelin star grade. It was either we made excellent choices from the vast menu or the remote possibility that everything they have on their menu was that good.What we had :1) cockles, fresh and succulent.2) crunchy baby squid, tasty not too sweet.3) the famous chilli crab, the freshest crab, tasty sauce with enough heat and a lot more than tomato sauce and chilli paste. The best version I have had, a born-and-bred true blue Singapore, I don't know why I haven't discovered Roland earlier.4) salted egg/crunchy yam crabs. The flavours and aroma were well balanced, they must have a more serious deep fryer than most restaurants to do what they did with this dish.5) baked cod, interesting with BBQ sauce and it actually tasted good.5) Fried rice with silver fish. Unbelievably light and fluffy, only possible with the stove that fed the deep fryer.I liked that they have a wine pairing menu although we washed down the fantastic meal with Tiger on tap. We had more than enough food for 4, and the bill was a shy of S$300.00, not cheap per head meaning I cannot come here every week, but the best value I know.For all you tourists out there, forget about the likes of chains like Jumbo and No Sign Board. They are no where near Roland. The only teeny weeny gripe : the food came a bit slow. the meal took 2 hours. Maybe they had a kitchen Nazi and every dish had to clear his inspection.As for my Japanese guest, he was gobsmacked. He is now planning a trip to bring his family to Roland and Singapore

It is a rather traditional, no frill but air-con Chinese restaurant. I took a friend and her mum from NZ here. It is on the 6th floor of a carpark near Parkway Parade. It is more suitable for a good family dinner. Probably not an ideal place to host your VIP as the restaurant isnt fancy. It was quite crowded on a weekday. There were 3 company functions going on when I was there. But it wasnt loud at all as the functions rooms were in separate enclosure areas. You can ask for bigger crabs if you have more people. @ $60/kg We had 2 types of crabs - chilli and Salted Eggs/Yam. Chili Crab definitely met our expectation and Salted Eggs/Yam was a nice surprise. We also had black sauce prawns @ $ 24, it only had 6 pieces but it was fresh and juicy. The sauce was good for our plain rice. Highly recommended dish. The other vegetables and meat dishes were yummy and delicious too. I must say I do a lot of business dinners and had eaten at quite a few famous seafood restaurants. So I will recommend this as it is a good place to try good Chili crabs with decent pricings on other food items

Had dinner here with friends. We ordered the chili and salted egg/fried yam crabs. It was delicious! One of the freshest and nicest chili crab that I have ever eaten. The salted egg/fried yam flavour is also highly recommended.

Just had dinner with friends after recommendation from ieatishootipost. Chili crab is good, the salted egg and yam crab is even better! Something unique.

Brought visiting friends from Australia to savor the Singapore famous chilli crab at this restaurant; also the (recommended) garlic pepper crab. Staff were friendly and prompt to reservation made.Tim sum selections were many but those ordered tasted only of very average standard (probably why they are so-cheaply priced). The chilli crab was good and all enjoyed it very much but the garlic pepper crab and pan-fried green vege were terribly salty and the vege was overly oily. Please, do not visit the washroom between servings, because the passage-way smelled liked a hospital ward (filled with detol smell). I lost my appetite after an untimely visit and I could see the unease from my friends who visited it after the meal. Well, my friends expressed satisfaction over the food (probably out of courtesy) but quietly I was uneasy over the choice of the restaurant. Price for the crabs not cheap though, at $56/- per kg. Service was good but the overall, it is average

Took a $17 Taxi ride to Roland Restaurant located above a car park on the East coast.It was lucky we booked, because at 7.30 pm on a Sunday night, what looked like a 150seat restaurant, was full.Although we had had Chilli Crab on previous visits to Singapore, the reason for booking at Roland's this time, was that we had been referred there by a local acquaintance who said that was were all the locals go for Chilli crab.The first thing I noticed when we arrived, was that we were the only non-Chinese diners there. I took this as a very positive sign and we were not disappointed. We ordered one chilli crab and a black pepper crab, as well as some rice and greens. Both crabs were superb. By far the best we'd had on our various trips to Singapore over the years.As we were the only non-Chinese guests, I asked our waitress, whether they had many tourists eat at the restaurant. She said that they didn't, because the owner refused to pay Taxi drivers a fee for recommending & bringing tourists there.Well all i can say is that the locals definitely know where to get great Crab dishes, and I will be going back next time and recommending it to my friends

It is true the chilli crabs sold here is by far one of the best, however, I feel the crabs are a tad expensive going at $43 at 800g and $123 for 2 1.1kg crabs, mind u these are not big crabs. The rest of the dishes are very local restaurant price and pretty well prepared.Service at restaurant I will give it 5 actually, the staff are attentive and fast in request thou it was a pretty packed nite

We were at Roland for dinner and took a set menu for 6 pax. The set consisted of shark fin soup, prawns, fish, duck, noodles and dessert. The food was quite decent but not that cheap. Will still return to the Roland for the food, but probably not so soon.

See full reviews & photos at my blog=http://chefquak.wordpress.com/2013/04/27/nice-dinner-roland-restaurant-on-24apr2013-2/Roland Restaurant was the venue for our get-together dinner on 24apr2013.Roland had a long history (from 1956 when Lim Choon Ngee & his wife started a seafood restaurant by the Kallang River, later relocated to Bedok Beach ‚Äì now the reclaimed ECP ‚Äì and the current location at Block 89, Marine Parade Central managed by their son Roland after they migrated to Christchurch in 1985) and reputation and the food is certain to be good. I have always wanted to try but never quite got round to it. I parked my car at Parkway Parade, not by design but turned out to be not a bad option as parking for the evening was only $1.50! The more seasoned among my peers correctly parked at the multi-storey car park where the restaurant itself was located on level 6.We had 13 pax for the evening. Dinner started with the appetizer platter (prawn mayo, small octopus, a seasoned pork dish, haechor & a roll item) which was quite good as expected.That was followed by a crab meat sharks fin soup ‚Äì good too if nothing exceptional. Sambal kang kong was next. Roland was a good standard restaurant so all the dishes thus far were good.Next was the roast chicken. This was nicely done! The skin was crispy & the meat moist, sweet & tender, very nice taken with a dip of 5-spice salt provided. CH & I thought the deep-fried squid (their signature dish) was par excellence ‚Äì crispy, crunchy, tasty! must say I had not taken it for a really really long time liao (don‚Äôt go Long Beach, Jumbo type seafood restaurants often & these days they also do fine dining dishes & deep-fried squid does not feature much).The chilli crab (top photo) was another of Roland‚Äôs signature dish. This was very good too, though these days many restaurants like Long Beach, Jumbo etc do this very well too. & of course the deep-fried mantou buns to soak up the chilli crab sauce. yummy! :- )The fried rice was also of good standard ‚Äì ‚Äúpang‚Äù got ‚Äúwokhae‚Äù ie fragrant (my favourite though was the Imperial Treasure dried scallop crab-meat egg-white fried rice, and recently I had a very good one at Xin Cuisine). the deep-fried tiny silver fish I supposed gave it added textured complexity though it didn‚Äôt really work for me ‚Äì too crunchy ‚Äì I preferred my fried rice simple & fragrant.the orh nee yam puree dessert was like totally bland? I guess no lard no taste la such a wonderful, fun evening of food, fun & feel good

We had a bit of difficulty looking for the place, finally found it on the sixth floor of a parking lot.Even though the place was huge, the staff were very prompt and attentive.Their deep fried baby squid was crispy and tasted sweet. The sweet and sour pork was also good but the main highlight of the meal were the two crabs, one the traditional chili crab and the other, salted egg crab. Both were delicious. The chili crabs had just the right amount of spiciness, the fried mantou was perfect for mopping up the sauce. The salted egg crab was very tasty, the coating, crunchy. A must order when dining here. Pricing is just right, not cheap but not expensive either.Will surely come back when in Singapore

We were invited to this dinner for 12...the dishes were generally very good despite a full house. The favourite dish was a two way pomfret fish where the chef deepfried one side of the fish into a bowl shape, and then lightly fried the other side, and when cooked, will piece out the delicious flesh and fried the vegetables and fish together.The chili crab...and it is not hot, was delicious...soak the sauce with the bread buns...yummy!!!Highly recommended

Roland restaurant is large. We went there during lunch time and it was quite empty. The chili crab was fantastic. The crabs have a lot of roes and the sauce was thick which is perfect for the fried mantou. We also ordered a black pepper crab which I really liked as well. The crabs here are very fresh and the crab meats were solid. Another dish we tried was the pompret cooked two ways. The fish was also very fresh. The shrimps in black sauce were very delicious and the deep fried crullers were wonderful. The draft beer here were cold and refreshing. I would definitely return to this restaurant

this was very good crab. there was a stronger flavor of cilantro than other chili crabs we've tried and we liked it a lot! also somehow a curry-ish undertone and sharper peppers than others. excellent stuff!but we wonder about the cost - the place is in a car park (not easy to find!) and not swanky... so SGD 50+ for the crab was a bit of a surprise to us.however, if you're a crab aficionado you should give this a tr

Now I had given up and forget about going to East Coast Park if I want chilli or pepper crab dishes. Instead, I will go straight to Roland for my seafood craving every once and then.It is not a very beautiful restaurent, but who's care when its come to good food. Their pepper crabs and salty egg yolk crab dishes very good, and you having it in air-con comfort, as compare to some other open space non air-con areas which will be crowded and stuffy.The only issue is that this restaurent is located on top of a public car park inside public housing estate. But then this is not a drawback, as many locals know about this place. This also did not stop me from bringing my overseas friends to this place for seafood. Prices rather reasonable and service quite good, in a clean place to have your meals

I found this restaurant about three years ago and have returned frequently on my many visits to Singapore.Roland's father invented chilli crab back in 1958 and they haven't looked back since...Roland and his son always make myself and my guests very welcome - he thinks I look like Bruce Willis so we always have a joke about that... the menu is extensive and caters for the whole range of Singaporean cuisine - the other diners are always 99% local people which inspires confidence.The only slightly unusual feature is that it is sited on top of a multi story car park and has no external windows.. buy that doesn't stop the local people using Rolands as their venue of choice for weddings and other festivities (there are always parties going in the the many function rooms)however the chilli crab is the star of the show and should not be missed...Well done to Roland and his family..

We had a dinner for 9 adults and 5 children recently. Plus was they have tables large enough to accommodate us. Service was also quite good. The waiting staff had a smile on their faces and even when we asked for hot water to prepare food for our baby, the request was met happily and without a grudging look.Other positives were that if you are looking for a family type Chinese meal without the hassle of walking and jostling with people in a shopping mall, this restaurant is a good option. It is close to the beach in the East Coast so you can plan for the meal as part of a weekend or family event. Car park is literally right next to the restaurant in the same building so that offers convenience too. You can also plan for a grocery shopping trip with a good sized supermarket just a stone's throw away across from the restaurant.Negatives:- during peak hours, you have to wait for the only one elevator, which was old and dated- food was only average. Nothing to shout about. It came across almost as if "alright, if you like to have Chinese food, we can prepare it for you." - not really suitable for couple type mealI do not think the taste, the food portions or the price left a lasting impression. But if you have to host a non-formal dinner for a group without the hassle of travelling to the city, and don't mind that prices are not really a bargain for a suburban restaurant, this place is worth considering
