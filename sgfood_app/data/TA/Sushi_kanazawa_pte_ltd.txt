So I’ve been told by someone to give this place a try. Put it off for a while but decided to have dinner there today. 1-Upon arrival, sushi chef curtly told us to take a seat at the end of the sushi bar and gave us 2 menus. “Omakase is basically a buffet concept for $40/pax. ok so no frills then. Let’s do that.2-Started with endamame, a piece of grilled corn, soggy pregnant fish(shishamo) and mushroom soaked in butter. Should have quit this point.3-All in all we had about 10 pieces of sushi each. Every piece was horrible and 2 pieces were rancid!. The mackerel was in fact so off both me and my fellow dinner spat it out immediately upon consumption. The sushi was all tiny pieces of various sashimi on a huge lump of rice. And the rice was seasoned with a strange smelling sauce so we skipped most of the rice. After 9 pieces of sushi, and 1 hour has passed from very slow service, the chef told us we will not be served anymore as we were not consuming the strange smelling rice. At which I had given up even arguing with him and just called for the bill since he was literally telling us to leave unless we were willing to pay extra for any subsequent order. And mind you we were still in the middle of our “omakase”. The course couldn’t have been served any slower and the quality couldn’t possibly be any worse. I’ve had much better sushi anytime from most supermarkets. Our total bill was $105. All we had was 2 glasses of tea and 10 pieces of sushi each of which onky 8 pieces were barely fit for consumption. In short, it’s the worst quality sushi you will ever have with a dodgy buffet concept on top of very slow service.

Chef Henry gives you little pieces of joy at a good pace. You will get to try different kinds of fish that you may not normally order off the menu in a normal restaurant. At $41.90++ per person for dinner, you will get free-flow of sushi and some appetizer dish. Take this option if you can stomach alot of rice, as it can be good way to try new things and if you have a good appetite. You can order your choice off a list or just let the Chef gives you what he wants (preferred).But if you are not one who likes to take so much carbo, going ala carte is a good choice too. Talk to Chef for recommendations or seasonal items.Down side: Only have about 10+ seats on the sushi counter on high chairs. One table of 2 persons and one private room of 4-6 persons. So this place is not for big groups

Hands down, without a doubt, my favourite Japanese restaurant along Orchard Road. $32++ for a buffet-style Omakase by Chef Henry for weekday lunch. I have a huge appetite and am rather picky with my Japanese sushi, but this place always hits the spot. A tip: The restaurant only offers sushi bar seating and a small tatami style private room to sit a max of 6 persons. I love it because I always come here alone or with an additional person. But it may not be the best recommendation if you are looking to have a conversational dinner as everyone sits in a row.

Was brought here by a friend and found that I liked the experience of eating here and ended up visiting again not long after the first visit.It's a very small and cozy place. I think can at most seat 10-15 people. Most guests will be seated at the counter and can watch the chef prepare the sushi. The food is fresh and if you go for the buffet, there's a good variety (if you have big appetite). In my case, I only managed less than 15 sushis if I remember correctly. If you know what you like, you can directly tell the chef to prepare for you even if you are taking the buffet

The restaurant is a very small restaurant and hide inside of international shopping building. One of my friends brought me there and tried buffet for dinner. I couldn't eat so much, so it's kind of waste. If we could eat a lot, it's worth for value. The service was great from Chef Henry. Good job. Next time if I visit, I wisely choose A la carte menu.

This building is just next to the Thai embassy, level 2, you'll see the ANZ bank in front. Nice quiet corner, about 12 seats. They have buffet at $48 each, or ala carte, or box sets. We ordered ala carte premium sushi plate at $25 each. It was very decent for the price. We also had salmon belly sashimi, which was a good and thick portion. A good place if you want sushi and sashimi in Orchard but not pay an arm or leg. It's not expensive, so it isn't the omakasae standard $150 or $250 per head dinner standard. Rice, fish freshness, quality, attention to detail is nowhere near top quality but you are paying about 1/3 to 1/2 the price of it.

Went for lunch once & thought was a nice small place to go back for dinner so I did so.Opted for the omakaze dinner but was greatly disappointed by it. For the price charged, I've eaten better ones elsewhere, the sashimi especially the swordfish was not fresh & when it was highlighted to the chef owner......he said "it is" and didn't even bother checking his balance stock to verify my remark. Overall was not impressed by the dinner and I won't go back again

This is my second time at this restaurant. I like the sushi buffet and I let Chef Henry give me the freshest catch of the day, rather than ordering from the menu. He makes better sushi than his staff, in terms of rice portion. The serving lady is dressed a little unprofessional (an over-sized T-shirt which looks like for home use) but I supposed Kanazawa is like a home-restaurant. Would recommend for the sushi and ambience. Make sure you make a reservation

freshly made upon order. wide variety with fresh ingredients. a few types of sake available. not overly expensive. friendly staff. cosy place (small). be sure to make a reservation if you are going in a group. try omakase style if you are adventurous. or else there is a menu (tablet) for you to order from. can request to reduce the rice portion because it can get quite filling after a while

I ate here a few times during my two weeks business trip to Singapore while staying in the Hilton just across the road. Nice, tiny sushi bar that is well equipped with all kinds of sea food including uni. Also good choice of sake. Staff is nice

Really fresh sushi, made by a proper chef. The ambience was fairly cozy and everyone was polite and great. The sushi came a little quicker than expected but it was not too bothersome. The price was around SG$38 per person

Not a very romantic ambience but very good sushi. The personel was very helpful and kind. We sat for about half an hour and we payed 100 Sdollar pp. Rather expensive but good. I can recommend this place.

I took a friend for lunch. We went for the $29.90 buffet which we enjoyed. The place in small but service is efficient and food is good. All together, with beer the billed added to $83.35 inc get and service. This is not cheap.

A friend had recommended this place to me a few months ago. Given his excellent recommendations, I should have paid attention but I filed it and quickly forgot. On a whim, while in the vicinity I remember his comments and soon found myself in one of the best sushi for the price places in Singapore! Excellent quality fish, fantastic service, and awesome conversation. It was a first time visit but definitely will not be the last. Highly recommend

This is a small restaurant that from the appearance and ambience alone, one would not think that it would serve such good sushi, but it did.We avoided the ala carte buffet version, and ordered what we liked. The sushi came seared at the top with a blow torch, kind of half cooking the fish. I know I dont do justice to the sushi by describing it this way, but the resultant taste and texture is very unique! Aside from the basic fish taste/texture, the firing of the surface adds a smoky flavor to the fish and changes the texture of the seafood - eg the scallop, while not liquefying, became quite soft - an interesting texture. All this on top of the rice which is just the right portion/flavor/texture to add firmness and foundation to the overall dish. Quite a unique presentation! Normally I enjoy eating my sushi with the wasabi and a dip of the soy sauce, but I found myself avoiding this combination as the sushi themselves were quite flavorful in themselves. I guess the big difference between a traditional sushi and this version to me, is in the taste and texture - the former is valued for the purity and subtlety of taste and texture, the latter, more like a cooked dish but not quite cooked....The food is good, presentation ok, but the ambience as a Japanese restaurant is not quite there. It is small but feels more packed than "Japan-spaced". We sat at the counter, but could barely see the chefs at work with a high serving wall between us. Chefs are locals, but doesnt detract from the quality of food served, except without the mannerism of the Japanese chefs, something that is so quintessentially "the Japanese food experience". I would go back for the food, but I think the potential for this restaurant could be so much more if they paid attention to "all the senses" as the traditional Japanese restaurants do - they do have the main ingredient in the food quality down - now for the rest of the senses

Having visited Sushi Kanazawa sometime ago (when it was named Sushi Kikuzawa), through reviews and recommendations of friends, I decided to pay them another visit as I remember the sushi there was fresh and palatable. This little Japanese restaurant is located at 360 Orchard Road #02-13 International Building, Singapore 238869 and the number for reservations is 6738 3833.A traditionally-furnished Japanese food bar, Sushi Kanazawa only seats about 10-12 at one time, so do make your reservations to avoid disappointment. While diners are perched on the comfortable high seats, the friendly and attentive chefs prepare sushi items right in front of diners, and serve them fresh. We opted for the ala-carte buffet lunch, and awaited the surprises that awaited us.We were first served appetizer items such as Edamane (Japanese green peas) lightly salted and a bowl of Nikijaga (stewed chicken, radish slice, fried tofu cube and mysterious-jelly broth) was tasty and welcoming since it was piping hot. A tantalizing platter of Sashimi Moriawase - raw tuna, shrimp, white fish and squid, was served next. I loved the fresh tastiness of it all, with slight hints of chewiness. My only qualms were that we were only allowed one serving of this dish, and they did not include my favorite salmon and swordfish sashimi.Nonetheless, moving on, we savoured the Unagi Aburi (river eel) sushi served next - slightly crispy with hints of smokiness amongst the sweet eel taste. It was so, so buttery smooth and tender it melted in the mouth - nothing of the "boney" texture of unagi served by other Japanese restaurants. I had a second helping on this.Next, the Saba (mackerel) - another tender creation that was quickly stuffed into the mouth to be devoured. The torched Shake Aburi (seared salmon) was the winner here - succulent and smokey on the top and chewy beneath - because only the top was torched. I loved the texture and taste of this delicacy.Then we were served the Amaebi Mentai Aburi (seared sweet prawn with cod roe) - another expertly blowtorch application by the chef - the delicious blend of slightly charred, saltish roe that melted in the mouth stacked atop of the succulent raw sweet prawn was heavenly. I loved this divine dish - and had a second helping on this as well.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/lunch-at-sushi-kanazawa-international.htm

My wife and I decided to get the advertised sushi buffet special for 48 or so Singapore dollars each. The sushi chef started out by bringing a variety of sashami and sushi one by one. The sushi negeri had a lot of rice and just little slivers of fish and eventually after eating several pieces I began to just eat the fish, not wanting to fill up on rice. After seeing that I didn't eat two or three portions of the negeri rice, the chef came over to me immediately and said, "You must eat all your rice." A bit confused, I kind of laughed thinking that he was kidding or just being weird. Eventually the chef mentioned it again to me and then the manager came over and said, "You must eat all your rice, or we will not serve you any more sushi." I thought I was being punked or something, I mean for come on! I paid 48+ Singapore dollars for an all you can eat sushi and then I get treated like a 5 year old, being told, "Eat your rice!" Bottom line, find a different sushi bar..the sushi was mediocre at best and the owners are obviously focused on trying to maximize their profits, not satisfy their customers

This outlet was recommended by a friend to try. I wanted to try out this restaurant for quite awhile but opportunity never strike!. However, I finally had a chance to try out last week. This is a small sushi bar at the International Building. Cozy and Quiet. Service is great! They are very attentive and sincere. Food - Excellent!, Taste - Unique! Choices - Decent for Buffet. have interesting choices. Food is very fresh, you can just taste it. The grilled one, you can taste the charcoal flavor in your mouth. Price - a little over average for the Buffet but Worth every cents! Reservation is highly recommended, for weekends and friday nights, maybe, one or two days in advance. This is a place I wouldn't mind going again and never say No to

We have been visiting this restaurant since the days when it was known as Sushi Kikuzawa and operated by a Japanese chef/owner. It has changed hands, but we still patronise it as the standards have not dropped.This is an eat all you can buffet where you sit at the counter and eat whatever the chef makes and serves you over the counter. Sashimi is limited to one portion per diner though. There is a very wide variety of fresh seafood so unless you're a huge eater, it's impossible to taste everything that's available. Nothing beats sushi made freshly right before your eyes and served immediately so sit at the counter rather than in the private room if you can. We've been there many times and will return. Ask for the loyalty card. Each set meal earns a stamp and when you've collected a certain number of stamps you get to enjoy the next buffet for only $10
