Went on 30th January 2017.
It's all closed. Signs say it's closed for routine maintenance, and will reopen soon. But no hint when it will open again.
We'll miss it, and hope it will be back when we visit Singapore again.

Wonderful spread of local food at very affordable prices. Highly popular place for tourists to enjoy local food.
5
We were looking for something nice to eat before going on the Singapore flyer and found a really nice Chinese restaurant here, ordered fried rice, lemon chicken and prawn curry, all amazing and definitely recommend this to anyone.
5
We ate dinner here on our second night in Singapore. Delicious offerings everywhere, lots of different foods available. I chose my fave Satay sticks! SOOOO good! Lots of seating available too.
4
The various stalls that are spread out dish out great food at an affordable price.Supposed to be the oldest hawker center in Singapore
3
The Singapore Food Trail seeks to bring back the nostalgic feel and charm of Singapore hawker food in the 1960s. My family and I came here on Dec 28, 2016, around 8pm.Location-----------Located near the main entrance of the Singapore Flyer, it is the only "cheap" food option (i.e. no GST and service charge) here. There are no other food courts, and other dining options at the Flyer are more expensive restaurants. I say "cheap" because prices are higher than equivalent stalls in traditional hawker centres.The next nearest hawker venue is Gluttons Bay about 650m (10min) walk away, next to the Esplanade. The nearest MRT station (Promenade) is equally faraway, and there's not much sheltered/shaded walkway in between.Car parking---------------There's a 284-lot multi-storey car park nearby. Rates are:MON-FRI before 5/6 PM: $2.00/hr from 6am to 6pmMON-FRI after 5/6 PM: $2.00/entry from 6pm to 6am the following daySAT: $2.00/hr from 6am to 12midnight, $2.00/entry from 12midnight to 6am the following daySUN / PUBLIC HOLIDAYS - $2.00/hr from 6am to 12midnight, $2.00/entry from 12midnight to 6am the following dayOpening Hours--------------------I was surprised to find half the stalls closed on a school holiday weekday evening after 8pm (I just alighted from a WTS coach bus at the Singapore Flyer coach park, after returning from a Thomas Town day-trip). This pales in comparison to Glutton Bay.Layout and ambience-----------------------------The theme is retro with vintage props such as a trishaw (where u can take photos in) and dÃ©cor (glass Fanta bottles, ice-shaving machine). There is supposed to be a little antiques shop tucked away at the back selling genuine antiques such as old cameras, clothing, artwork, watches and records.There are plenty of seats (600 according to its website). They're all located under shelter. Though the place is not air-conditioned, the high ceiling meant it was quite well-ventilated.There are 10-plus hawker stalls. Half were closed when I was there. I'm not sure if they're closed permanently, given declining traffic to the Singapore Flyer in general. Toilets are nearby within the Flyer complex.Food-------There is a variety of Chinese, Malay and Indian food. The business owner had sought out well-known hawkers of these cuisines and invited them to set up branches here, e.g. Rong Chen Bah Kut Teh, Boon Tat Street Barbeque Seafood, Katong Keah Kee Fried Oysters, Satay Bee Hoon and Alhambra Satay Club, as well as Ice Balls and Kacang Puteh.Food quality-wise, I thought they were ok, slightly better than the average hawker stalls. Price-wise, they're easily 50% higher, but I guess that's because this place is catering mainly for the tourist who've just finished a Flyer ride and wants to have a convenient spot to try local street cuisine.Service----------Like most hawker centre stalls, don't expect too much customer service. A clear articulation of what you want (which dish, big-vs-small, dry-vs-wet, add-chilli-or-not, eating here-vs-takeout) and a grunt reply telling you how long to wait (10min is common) is the SOP around here
2
We have been there at around 7 pm and tried to order something at different stands. After picking, waiting till finishing a talk, the first one said that there is just one set left. Unfortunatly, this scenario happened again. And the chefs were more than unfriendly... after our experience here in singapore where everyone was really friendly, this was some kind of unexpecte
4
Conveniently located at the Singapore Flyer with reasonable range of local food. Since we have been away from Singapore for last 2 years we could not wait to tuck in to the local dishes (thought there are several more food centers we could have gone too). The good part about this place is that it is not crowded during the lunch hour. The fried koey teow with cockles stall, mince meat dried noodles, wanton noodles and fried oysters are reasonably good. The dessert stall had ice balls - something we haven't seen for a long while. The food court is slightly more expensive compared to others but in return you don't get the crowds
3
We decided to have dinner before taking the Singapore Flyer. The food trail food court is conveniently located at the ground level. It has many food stalls. We visited after 8 pm where there were still food being served but some items in the menu ran out by that time. Nevertheless, we managed to grab some food and as it was not crowded, it was easy to find seats.Food wise was average but it was a good choice for affordable meals compared to the other alternatives around the area which are mostly restaurants
1
this place is purely for naive tourist, the food taste so bad that I cant believe I actually ate here years ago...the oyster omelette was so undercook and 0 fats which has no fragrance at all, yucks....the nasi lemak stall lie to tourist about 3 food in 1 set when its only 2 food in 1, when asked about the misleading picture the woman just walk off and cant be bother....all the stalls are manned by staff that doesnt have any interest in cooking food, most of it are just reheat and off you go....please do yourself a favor and eat somewhere with a true taste of Singapore.
3
Alas, it has fallen on hard times. Most of the good stalls are closed on a weekend. Skip the oyster omelette. The hot plate is really nice with generous servings.
4
We had oyster omlette and pork dumpling soup.
If one wants to have authentic street food and wants hygiene too, this is a place to be.
4
You will find this place just below the Singapore Flyer, so after an exciting ride, fo down and order a meal, its so good.
4
After your ride in the Singapore Flyer, just below is the Singapore Food Trail. Where you will find one of the best foods Singapore can offer, try their Roasted Pork, so good!
3
We did the Food Trail as part of the Moonlight Explorer on the HOHO bus. we weren't expecting it to be very good given the location and the fact it is a fast food arcade of assorted restaurants. We ordered the skewers and they ere on y $12 for 12 - but they were all deep fried and we didn't like that at all. Other got he noodles and said ti was OK. general, you get what you pay for so shop around here and, as the rule goes, buy where there is the longest queue
3
An open area under Singapore flyer offerred a few food stalls but with enough choice to enjoy with whether for lunch or dinner. Noodles and rice with different side dish to go along can be ordered. No western food here so don't expect pizza or burgers at this spot
1
I like good quality food the food in general served in the restaurant and coffeshop is neither as if the ride on the flyer was rather terrible the food here is worse, self-serving is out, the venue as the flyer should be first class as it is a showcase for Singapore, go eat somewhere else, the prices are high as well espec. for drink
2
Went on a weekday for lunch. More than half of stalls closed. Only a few tables occupied (by tourists). Looks like stall operators hanging on and hoping for better days to come back. Car park quite empty even with free lunch time parking. Ended up eating at Sky Garden Chinese dim sum. Checked with staff ad was told weekday evenings even more deserted
4
We stopped here after the flyer because we had 4 x $5 vouchers from our SIA stopover package. You pick them up at the drinks stall and you are given 2 x $2 and 1 x $1 voucher per person. Drinks are a couple of dollars and water was only $1 which was interesting given that we saw it for $2.20 at the stall around the corner. Most of the stalls are various asian dishes. We went to a stall at the end where you select items on sticks ($1 each) and the guy fries them on the spot and gives them back to you. This was a great snack before heading to our next stop. Most of the stalls seemed to be reasonably priced
2
We were very tired & footsore- very keen to not walk far after our ride on the Singapore Flyer- walked to the food trail but we were underwhelmed. Compared toothed dining options we had experienced, we were disappointed with the ambience (or lack of) & the menu options available, so we kept walking until we found somewhere better
4
Today at the Singapore Flyer we had lunch at the 1960's styled food trail. We ate the oysters with egg omlete, huge flavour lots of coriander. Highly recommend
4
first time eat pork feet here, its so fatty and oily but the taste is so delicious.. the price is cheap
4
What a great way to sample all of Singapore's different local cuisines while you are at the Singapore Flyer. The food is quite cheap but full of flavours and there is something for everyone - from Chinese to Indian to Malay cuisine.
2
Nothing great about it, they have put small stalls all over, it gives a nice local feeling, but the food is not good.
5
Imagine hawker food with a cosmopolitan of Chinese, Peranakan (Nonya), Malay and Indian flavours at the Singapore Flyer. We went by night and through our SIA Holiday Stop Over received $5.00 vouchers each that we used on the extremely cheap food. The area is so clean and undercover. We were there on New Year's Eve and didn't have any issue with finding a spare table and chairs
4
All the specialties of hawkers for most areas in Singapore are here. But the chili crab and black pepper crab are higher-priced than other hawker centers. it's almost restaurant priced but all good. You can try the bbq sticks they're all tasty. Chicken rice was OK I guess. Not hard to find a taxi after gluttonizin
4
This food court area is located below the Singapore Flyer! I went here just before lunch time and it was pretty empty. Most of the stands were open at this time so there was quite a bit of selection to choose from! I'd recommend dining at these food plazas when in Singapore since it's a great way to sample some Asian cuisine! (They're pretty much everywhere and some are even open for 24 hours!)I ordered the roasted chicken over rice dish since I was craving it and I wanted to try a legit version besides the ones I've eaten on the plane, lol! Anyway this place is filled with cheap eats!!!! The chicken and rice dish I ordered was under $2USD *good portion and I was able to eat more after my walk to the Marina*
3
It is somewhat ironic that here they showcase what S'pore street food might have looked like before all the carts were condemned and food makers had to move into the hawker centers. So, right under the big tourist attraction wheel they have recreated several such carts with local food offerings. In no way as authentic (or cheap) as the real food centres, but possibly great for those people on a long layover and doing the city in a mere few hours
2
I was at the Singapore Flyer food trail over the Singapore GP weekend. I stopped there for a quick dinner on my own. Decided to try the prawn noodle soup with pork ribs. The soup was ok, but the prawns were not fresh. You could taste the "fishy" taste in the prawns. The pork ribs also tasted like they were cooked in old, stale oil. A bowl of noodle soup cost $10. Way over priced. What's more, the next morning I had diarrhoea likely to be from that dinner. I can't comment about the other stalls, but I would stay away from the prawn noodle soup stall
5
Hitting a hawker food court like this is a must do in Singapore. It is a covered, but open air food court with big fans. There are dozens of different local and other Asian vendors with all kinds of meat, fish and vegetarian specialties. If you have a short time, you can experience a ton in one meal here with friends. I suggest everyone picks several different dishes and share them all
5
Great place to eat with a variety of food from which to choose. I had a few meals here and enjoyed them all.
3
Unlike normal hawker centres where there's always a crowd, the Singapore Food Trail offers the variety minus the crowds. However, some of the food just doesn't live up to its hype i.e. the famous names. In fact, some can be quite disappointing.
4
Wherever you go, you can get nice food from Singapore. If you go food court it would be cheaper than any restaurants.
3
It's not far from the Helix bridge. It's in Singapore Flyer. I walk to there. There are not many food shops. The food is not delicious but it's cheap. There is 7-eleven around there.
4
At first, I was almost deceived by the unappealing ambience of this place. But after sampling some local Singapore staples, like Singapore fried rice, cereal prawns, honey squid...they were really tasty. It's sort of a hawker dining to experience, but I truly enjoyed the good food. I wished I could have sampled their rice cakes and satay, but had to rush to the airport. Worth coming back. Would recommend
3
The food here is nothing to shout about, but good enough to fill up your stomach, if you are not fussy about food. We had the chicken rice (mediocre), the fried oyster with egg (slightly better, with generous portion of oyster) and the mua chi coated with crushed peanut (fresh, warm and soft, very good)
3
Situated at the base of the Singapore Flyer this hawker set up offers a broad range of eating and drinking options at very reasonable prices. There is a good atmosphere amongst the many diners. Food that we had was well cooked and tasty. Comments about service should be borne in mind in relation to other factors such as price, location, etc. What does one expect from an outlet area like this?We had the satay sticks, stingray, palm juice drinks and some curries. The curries were the least tasty dishes but again overall it was reasonable. We did return a few times because of the closeness to the Flyer, the views across to the Gardens and the F1 track
4
I have been here twice now and both times the service has been very very bad. I wanted a bottle of water for my daughter who was feeling unwell because of the heat. The only guy selling drinks was busy on his iphone loading some sort of gaming cards. I stood waiting for him once he finished the first one he turned looked at me they carried on loading 6 more cards I asked if I could please get water, he totally ignored me. I would have walked away if there had been anywhere else to buy water or any drink nearby. The first time we went the service was just as bad with staff just ignoring us to do anything be sell us stuff. The only reason they get away with it is because there is nowhere else nearby. Food is Ok, but not good price is Ok but not cheap. If you have a coupon go but otherwise take you own food and drinks or walk to Makansutra Gluttons Bay for a real meal with actual service
3
We ate here for lunch as part of the Singapore Stopover promotion and had a $5 off coupon. For the moment, it satisfied the timing for the days events as we were limited on time. The food wasn't really anything special and fit the need. It is nothing I would seek out if it weren't for the fact that it was lunchtime, we were at the flyer and it was convenient.
5
Think a lot of people go to the flyer and never see this part.We were so pleased to find it, and the food from the left hand side far end was were we got our food from... Whow fabulous food at good price, think some people think don't buy from other then proper cafes etc. these are well known and clean and suHolding be missed. We even had palm dish yea food served on a palm leaf. Wonderful
4
If you ever get a chance please visit Singapore. Singapore has diverse culture when it comes to food and people. You will not be disappointed.
5
An experience! Cheap and tasty local food in an area set up to look like traditional food stalls. Lots of variety and minimal prices, crazy busy sometimes and great people watching. Right beside the Singapore Flyer.
4
If you're looking for good food at a relatively low price, don't miss this authentic food! One of the nicest Kway teow I have tried, and the bbq pork was tasty as well. Plenty of selection and a lot of westerners eating there as well.
3
we visited this restaurant during a stopover from our hop-on hop-off adventures in Singapore.
It's simple and nice, typical food court ambiance, like any us mall. The bear was great though.
3
Unfortunately only half of the stalls were open and had limited choices on the thursday night at 8.15 when we visited after our ride ln the flyer. However, we did enjoy the sugar cane juice, naan bread and roast pork with rice.
3
A little more expensive and a little less variety than at normal hawker centers. The atmosphere is very nice in the evening however and the food tastes great.
5
A little bit pricier than you would otherwise pay but a convenient place to get a variety of hawker good in one place set in a 1960s themed setting. Great food.
2
The Food Trail is a quaint setup but it is dirty. Limited choices too. Better to visit a food centre, e.g. Maxwell Road.
4
The Singapore Food Trail is a uniquely themed food court inside the ground floor of the Singapore Flyer, with open sides. Made out in the style of an old street, it has vendor carts pleasantly displayed next to a pathway, with tables in the centre. Offering plenty of options, ranging from Chinese to Malay to Indian, as well as a blend of these, one is spoilt for choice. The prices are quite reasonable too. However, since it is not enclosed, it can get a little warm in the afternoon, so choose the time, weather and table carefully
5
We ate here on 2 occasions, once after a trip to Legoland and again after a trip on the Singapore Flyer and loved the food. It was reasonably priced. Great place to take children. Drinks were cheap. You can catch a cab right there as well. I would return here again. We loved the special fried rice in the pineapple
2
cheap but the taste is not quite tasty compare to downtown. the same price, better taste in down town or in gey lang area. We got $15 food voucher from flyer city pass A. It was disappointing food. The tables were full of birds poops.
5
if you've ever been to singapore, you'll understand that soft shelled crab is all your really going to want! cheap eats, drinks are never cheap in singapore
5
One of the best meals we had in Singapore. Lots to choose from and very inexpensive. We ate here on a number of occasions
4
Nice place if you want convenience of location when visiting the Singapore Flyer. There are different selections to choose from and the street food style adds to the charm of the place. Make sure to try their sugar cane juice and dimsums.
5
If you dont mind eating outside, you dhould try this out. The food is cheap, the quality is pretty good and the dishes are stuffing. I havent found anything which i wouldnt do again. However...this is not a restaurant - even though lots to choose from (including desert...tried sugar cane juice already? Or slush ice with sirup?) one does eat in public. Ots not directly on thr roadside, but resembles a bit a "Biergarten".... worth trying..oh and on the way out, at the entrance to the Singapur flyer..one can find Singapores famous icecream makers :-
4
This place was recommended to me by someone, and I'm glad I took my family to experience it as it was a bit of a trek from where we were at Bugis St. It was inexpensive by Singapore standards and the quality was high. We initially ordered five dishes of sorts and my kids and wife didn't like the taste of a few so we just got some others which was not a problem considering the low prices. I had the Hokkien Noodles and that was definitely the best of all our dishes in my opinion. The environment was okay, obviously trying to make the old fit with the new...but we were there more for the food
3
This is a food court but a bit higher end. It's supposed to be reminiscent of a 1960's food court. It has a few 'antiques' dotted around the place, including a typewriter?!I was a bit baffled as it is the food court that feeds visitors the one of the most 21st century attractions that ii The Singapore Flyer. Nothing to get excited about
5
We found the Singapore Food Trail in two locations, Chinatown and Singapore Flyer. We found many stalls offering different local food that you can choose from based on your budget and preference. I just tell the owner not spicy because we did not prefer spicy food. More affordable food compared to restaurant
3
Food is average yet the surroundings create a good atmosphere. Recommended is the ice ball which costs $1.5.If you would like to try laksa but cannot find a store selling something like it, you should try Newton's prawn noodles. Ask the salesperson for laksa as the broth and he/she should gladly offer it for free! Set of $10 comes with boiled vegetables. Delicious
4
Take this place at face value it is a retro hawker food stall place and has its own charm. Huge variety of food on offer with prices ranging from $5 to $15 or so. Only one stall selling drinks so perhaps a little pricey but still a cheap meal and fun setting. Our grandson woofed down most of the satay sticks and was looking for more
3
A top 10 hawker food center in this city-state. For old folks here, it's like bringing back food memories of the 60s good old days. Must-try - Indian chicken Briyani.
4
Many stalls here. You can find many famous street food in one place, eg. noodles, rice, laksa, sweets, etc. Nice decoration as well.
5
Nostalgic decor and airy surroundings at the foot of the Singapore Flyer. Good selection of signature local dishes. Hokkien Mee, chicken rice, and ngoh hiang are all good. Slightly more expensive than the usual hawker centre fare, but all worth it for the ambience.
1
Better setting than most of the hawker centres around - that is true. But the food selection was very limited and wasn't actually very tasty at all. Save your money and go to a "normal" hawker centre.
5
We tried Singapore Hokkian Mee, Fishball Noodle, Katong Fried Oyster, and Fried Char Kway Teow. Taste were all outstanding for a Hawker food. Ingredients are fresh, size is reasonable. They must have some good woking skill.The team behind Food Trail now have opened Singapore Food Street in Smith Street, Chinatown. Willing to try Bakkut Teh, Tiong Bahru Roast BBQ and Chae Tau Kwe next time I visit back
4
Singapore Food Trail is a replica of olden Singapore days, bringing one back in time to Singapore's hawker scene in the past, hence one may dine in nostalgic charm in themed settings from the past. There are wooden tables and marble-tabletop dining tables. There is a wide variety of local street and hawker food for diners to choose from, and prices are reasonable overall. This is a makeshift ornament or workshop, I believe. I don't think they are selling any food here and did not see any hawker in sight. One could see all the old-fashioned sewing machines in sight.We had the Ang Mo Kio Yong Heng Fried Baby Squid Hokkien Mee (SGD$8.00) - it wasnt bad. The broth made the noodles very tasty, and the prawns were succulent; the noodles were rather bouncy as well so overall the noodles were quite sumptuous.I contributed the Old Airport Road Satay Celup (SGD$8.00) because I have always heard about the famous "lok-lok", I've never eaten it before, and was curious to know what it was all about. I guess for this dish, the skewers of seaweed chicken, fishballs, cuttlefish, scallops etc are items that are pretty common and cannot go wrong - hence the dip is very important. The dip served was akin to a thick peanut gravy, and it was gratifying that we were given our individual plates of dip instead of one big pot of dip where everyone dips their skewers into. This was hygienic and a crispy assortment of items.We also had the Alhambra Satay Club Satay - beef, mutton and chicken. The flesh was BBQ-ed to perfect crispiness, and the marinated meat were tasty. The thick spicy peanut dip added flavor to the satay, making it another tastebud teaser.Lastly, some icy cold Chendol Balls (SGD$2.50 each) to wash down the hot food. The colorful ice balls contain loads of goodness within - such as jellies ("rubies"), red beans, attap seeds etc. It was a very refreshing and a welcoming, delightful burst of sweetness.

Great for a quick sampling of Singapore food, most of the local favourites can be found in this joint. The management was good enough to give it an old Singapore look for the tourists, but for locals, there are better places where they can get their daily fix. Price can be it higher that usual due to location. People still crowd the place as it is more convenient and cheaper than the other restaurants nearby. It's open-air but safe from the elements as it tucked under the Singapore Flyer buildin
4
The Singapore Food Trail is a retro style food court that were common in Singapore when I first visited thirty years ago. There are a dozen stall each offering different food types, Satay, Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese .......You can mix and match from each of the stalls or eat from one. Another stall sells drinks. The food is cooked as you watch, there is a good choice for vegetarians. This is a no frills, no white tablecloth venue, but one which will provide you with tastes that are much more authentic than those at much greater prices
3
We went on the Moonlight tour offered by the Ducktour company. As part of this tour we were all given vouchers to purchase food before our tour started. We ordered the satay dish consisting of various fried cheeses, seafood, chicken and tofu. The quality of the food was disappointing with the one spring roll being off. We also ordered a chinese noodle dish but since we were a bit pressed for time we asked for it to be packed as a take-away - we were charged S$1 for this! This dish was also disappointing. After eating these foods we had upset tummies. Although the stalls are quite clean and affordable, the quality of the food ensured that we will never eat there again
5
After enjoying the view of Singapore from up high, our stomach were mumbling. Singapore Food Trail has very good location to get a bite to eat before catching river cruise. The food are made from traditional stalls/kiosk. However, they are clean and affordable. The taste was also good. It can get very crowded during lunch hour
4
Situated at the base of the Sinagpore Flyer, is the Food Trail where a number of old street food carts are collocated. Recommend you try the Fried Oysters - Cheap and Fantastic.
We're going to try to replicate this dish back home.
4
It is a great place to try traditional Singapore cuisine. It is value for your money, not expensive at all. It was a bit overcrowded in the nights. But it was still a good experience to explore a different culture.
4
Nicetouristic place if you want to eat omething after sing flyer
A bit more expensive but people there is really nice
4
Better setting than most of the hawker centres, eg Newton, and looks like cleanliness and hygiene are better. Good food - particularly like the Hokkien noodles (small for 5SGD) and good prices for large bottles of Tiger
4
Without the coupon books, they are still cheap meals, individual stalls sell different type of foods: Indian, Singaporean, Chinese, Western etc.....if one miss a meal here, a few hundred meters away are some shopping malls with food courts.
5
It was a marvelous place to try Singapore cuisine which has good services, fresh foods and served nicely, I suggest it is one of Nicetouristic spot to go in Singapore. It will relieve you if you have a tired day. The price is little more expensive than the other but foods and services are value for money
5
This rating is only for the pork soup which was the only food we tried there. It was all fatty and unhealthy goodness. It was the best food I had in Singapore and simply the best chinese food I've ever had even compared to those in China. Can't really describe the position of the stall, but please check the photo for reference
3
Singapore Food Trail is actually more of a food court than a true restaurant. It claims to have the best hawker-style shops from Singapore and Malaysia. Indeed, some of the stalls were quite unique that offered the kind of local food not easily found elsewhere.I settled for a big bowl of Beef Kuay Teow that was hearty and hot. The vendor seemed to be popular with locals. I walked around the area for like three times before finding a seat. The beef noodles bowl I had was delicious. A big drawback was the intense heat of the place due to it being outdoors and the tables were rather close to the vendors cooking their hearts out. Some of the vendors (like the seafood omelette place) had a really long queue, which was a shame for people like me arriving late.All in all, Singapore Food Trail is probably the only affordable place if you are doing Singapore Flyer and just happen to be in the area. It is convenient if not particularly comfortable to dine at

Click Here: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/04/singapore-food-trail-singapore-flyer.html for full pictures and wordsI have always wanted to visit the Singapore Food Trail, which is a 1960s themed food street at Singapore Flyer and Food Republic Beer Garden at Harbourfront when they opened in early 2011. There was much hype when they opened but it seemed to have died downIn fact, I have forgotten about this place until I chanced upon an ongoing promotion through its Facebook page recently. One item from each stall was at $2.50 instead of $5--cheaper than those at most Food Republic food courts. Since there are substantial savings, I decided to give it a try.The noodles of the Satay Bee Hoon ($2.50) are well-strained so it was not too wet. More of that piquant gravy would be wonderful. Apparently, the stall that began since 1950s is famous for its gravy made from 15 ingredients, but lard is no longer used.The East Coast Lagoon Rojak was the star of that day. To be honest, we liked it more than the Kovan Rojak because the sauce had the right consistency and a well-balance sweet and tangy taste. The best thing was the you tiao (dough fritters) which stayed fresh and crunchy till the end.Food here are delicious and it is a relief to see that most stalls are still manned by Singaporeans--the owners or their relatives. Price wise, they are similar to Food Republic without using the discounts. But many of the stalls were either closed (eg. Ann Chin Popiah ) or had permanently stopped operations.For full post : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/04/singapore-food-trail-singapore-flyer.htm

We visited flyer in September 2011 and had no plans of eating dinner there but Singapore food trail in the complex looked too tempting to miss. Tad costlier than typical street food stalls in Singapore; however my dinner here was definitely a memorable one. Interesting food counters with colorful boards and delicious customized dishes, too confused about what to eat; I had a noodle dish with spicy condiments and ingredients as per my instructions (pic attached)
4
Old Singapore feel with comparatively cheap food. I ordered pawn noodle and fried oyster which were very good.
3
the place gets really crowded during lunch time & some food shop staff don't care much about food handling hygiene!
PIECE OF ADVICE: use disposable spoon & fork and/or chopsticks.
4
A nice place to get an inexpensive but good quality meal in the middle of the high-rent district. Authentic "old Singapore" feel. (I know, I was there!)
4
Yummy. I found this food arcade when I got lost one day, and for $5SGD I had roast chicken with rice - delicious & quite a big serving.
3
The Singapore Food Trail was a great find under the Singapore Flyer for a late dinner of traditional Singaporean cuisine. Yeah, it's probably touristy, but it sure beat wandering around late in the dark in an unknown area to find a place for dinner.The 2 of us shared a Hainanese chicken rice, oyster omelet, and a snow ball that was akin to Ice Kachang. Tons of stuff--beans, gelatin, syrup, etc.--hidden inside the ice, and I was a bit surprised to find a sweet corn topping as part of this dessert. The oyster omelet was way too oily and not quite reminiscent of previous encounters in Taipei, but the other two dishes were pretty good.I also saw a stand selling Dragon Beard peanut candy--a childhood favorite of mine--but alas, my tummy was too full to pack in another sweet.On the way out, I saw a bunch of people waiting in line for bak kut teh, a pork rib soup made with a variety of Chinese herbs and spices. Looked so yummy and healthy, but sometimes pigs just can't eat another bite. :

If you go to Singapore Flyer, you can try this place too. They provide Singapore traditional food. The place is not too big and the food choice is not too many. As any other dining place in tourist atttactions, this place is also a bit pricey.

Three stalls are outstanding here - carrot cake , oyster omelette and spring roll . The fish balls are pretty good as well as the Hokkien Mee . The prawn Mee soup was pricey and totally unremarkable and the beef noodle was a notch better .As with many eateries in Singapore , standards drop and prices increase after the first six moaths or so as the crowds thin out .However the carrot cake and Poh piah are excellen each time as well as the fish balls so worth a visit if you are round the are

OK, there are cheaper food courts around, but we can see why this one is just a little bit more expensive.First the food we eat is always top quality, just that bit better than elsewhere.Next the superb air-con [free] toilets.Then the delightful theming, 1960s decor.Finally, it's a great location, near the Sands, and right under the Singapore Flyer. So combine a meal here with a trip on the Flyer.We've used it ever since it opened, and have always been delighted with the food. It's easy for overseas visitors who may not be used to food courts, and everybody speaks good English.So don't miss it. It's a great chance to try out the food hawkers used to sell (along with lots of other things)

Initially I was suspicious, food outlets at a big tourist trap like the Singapore Flyer are not generally know for their taste or quality. I couldn't have been more wrong. One of the best meals that I've had in Singapore. The popish at Chinatown Ann Chins are amazing! The retro decor is fun helping to create a great atmosphere but the real attraction here is great food very reasonably priced. Don't miss it

Great value for money. Best priced COLD beer I found in Singapore. We ordered one dish between 2 of us at a time and shared. All the meals we sampled were great. I have already recommended it to friends and had great feedback from them too
