There are only very few restaurants in Singapore which is at least 70% of what it tastes in India. Anjappar which used to be good at the beginning later reduced their spice level a lot to cater to the local/international clients. Machans I would say is the best of all in Singapore which does justice to south indian food. The price is more or less same as that of Anjappar but when we see the quantity, it's a bit less. There are many traditional south indian items to try. We tried atleast 30% of the items so far. My best pick would be Madurai Mutton Curry. You won't get it in any other restaurant in Singapore. It's tastes so good. Mutton Biryani is not spicy at all, so I don't rate it high.In the deserts, coconut souffle and Kaatu Kambu Halwa are must try

This is a new place along Race Course Road. It stands out from the other Indian restaurants because of the interiors and pleasant ambience. The staff are friendly and attentive. We ordered mutton biryani and it was prefect. We also ordered the home-made fish fry and fried paneer for the starter. We also tried one of the beverages in the menu, forgot the name, and it's quite refreshing. The serving of the food is considerably small but surprisingly filling. The price is at par with all the other neighboring restaurants. We will come back again to try the other dishes.

I have gone here to for dinner. The place is a cozy space clean neat. Modern and chic interior which i liked. As for the menu every item was pricey i ordered their chef special promfet recommended by the waitperson prawns thokku chettinadu chicken mutton kola urandai food was to our liking but quantity was less ...i had some paper stuck with one of the dish when we pointed out they replaced it and also gave us an extra dessert on the hse...i will go back if its a special occasion as it was this time (my wedding anniversary) ...entire bill was nearly 70 dollars .. so def not a everytime lunch option ...plus not for those who cant eat spicy food...

Honestly the place was appealing and inviting. Step inside and place was clean and organised. Service was good not excellent though. Now to the food. I was disappointed with the food. Portion was small and taste wise, it was average. You will see a lot dishes from native India in the menu. But they tasted more experimental than traditional. For example the chicken Kurma thosai that I ordered looked and tasted more like a omelette. Good effort but price didn't justify my taste sense. Decided , this would be the first and last visit.

We have heard that the food at Machan's Kitchen is good. Hence, we wanted to give it a try. And we didn't regret at all. The food was delicious and the ambience and service by the youngsters was excellent. Appetizers, main course, dessert and drinks, all was great. Can't compliment any specific staff as everyone was friendly, prompt and knowledgeable in their products served. All the best Machan 's

Unique decoration, cutleries, menu... for an Indian restaurant, while keeping to the traditional cooking. The staff were enthusiastic, more like owners than employees. The mutton chettinadu was just right in spiciness and tenderness. The chappathi was a little hard. And I’ll come back again just for the egg Dosa. At the end, I ate too much leaving no room for dessert

We had a lunch here and wish we had discovered this place sooner. It is not your typical Indian restaurant in Little India, but an upmarket restaurant with great ambience, young staff and very clean, open and funky.We had the curry leaf fish and the Kongunadu Kozhi curry (chicken) and a Paratha, followed by the coconut souffle. Every mouthful was a treat and we could not fault anything at Machan's. The food was beautiful, the staff were friendly and engaged.We will be back

Situated next to famous names such as Anjappar this new restraunt dishes out some yummy South Indian dishes.The family ordered nandu vengaya kuzhambu (crab masala),mutton chuka,prawn milzhagu piratal (pepper prawn)mango kulfi and pista kulfi (indian ice cream)The crab masala had 1 whole flower crab broken into 2 parts.The gravy was mildly spicy and very flavourfull.I can taste the crab stock and the masala.Loved this dish the most!Next was mutton chuka,the meat was packed with just the right amount of spice,pepper,salt and juiciness.Even though its a dry dish the meat was still juicy.The prawns were cooked to perfection and the sauce had the right kick to tease your tastebuds.The pista kulfi had plenty of nuts,not too sweet,refreshing and way above my expectations.Loved the mango kulfi too!Machan kitchen had wonderful service and food arrived on time.The food was not oily and loaded with msg.The only downside was they had mineral waterbottles on the table.I thought it was complimentary but they had charged us $1.80 for each bottle.It will be really great if they could inform us so that we can decide if we want it or not.I paid $70 in total (my son ordered chappathi)but what was disappointing was that I was charged for a mineral water which i did not even drink:(Verdict:Go and enjoy great South Indian meals but do let the service staff know if you aren't drinking the bottled water:

What a charming little gem this is! Really bright, clean and modern - no dingy dark corners in here! Wonderfully friendly service with a smile. Food wise, very generous with the side bits like popadoms (they kept coming!) and pickles etc. I had:1. Yeral Prawn Milagu Massala2. Veggie Biryani (pallipalayam)3. Mutton chettinadu 4. ParathaThe prawns were succulent and gorgeously flavoured. The lamb was unbelievably tender. You could tell instantly the Chef took good care of these dishes. The veggie biryani was also carefully assembled and lovely. Great little place with friendly staff.
