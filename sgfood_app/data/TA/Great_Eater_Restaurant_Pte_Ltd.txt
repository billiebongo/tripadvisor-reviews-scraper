As stated above, this shop serves overrated and expensive crabs. Not fresh and I don't know why so many peoples are eating it.
Highly not recommended!

Delicious crabs! Especially black pepper ones if you love spicy stuffs! Chilli crab is good too with mantous!

The best crabs in Singapore! Must try the chilli and pepper crabs.I have brought overseas visitors many times and everyone had been satisfied with the food. Much better than some of the more famous names.

From the most unusual place of a HDB surrounding & sits just outside a town centre.The attraction were the many tables of customers, seen from the many HDB flats just across the road or whilst travelling along street 91 Jurong West (nearer the exit of NTU side gate).We had the best LaLa, crispy tou kee with fish paste, Kangkong sambal, hot plates, 2 other simple dishes (11 eleven of us) polished the plates clean with an expense of S$107.85 (very reasonable by restaurant standards).But I guess it should cost $38 per kilo at least.Giving ourselves a reason, we will be back for more nice food

The food court at Pavilion Shopping Mall in KL is just great. There are many types of local dishes including Korean and Japanese. The place is clean and looking for seats is easy, just not during lunch time which is the case as in other places as well. I had a great time sampling and eating the food which is reasonably priced and tasted great. I had the assam laksa, Sarawak laksa, vegetarian food and ice kacang, the 2 days I visited the place and they were delicious

Just to manage expectations: If you are after a fine eatery with silver cutlery, than this is not the right place for you. If you like however authentic and reasonable priced food in an all Asian atmosphere (sitting on plastic tables but surrounded by plenty of locals), than this is the place to go. It is easier if one person in your group speaks Mandarin, but I am sure, you will manage as well with English and body language.We love the Chili crabs (and still more that black pepper crabs) at this place, but they have other good Chinese food as well

I went there several times for seafood since I live near Pioneer MRT. The tastes are good, and prices are affordable and subject to seasons. I remember the October's price is 60SGD for 2 persons (enough for 2 persons). Other dishes are also worth trying besides seafood

Ate here with a group of friends for dinner. We had a variety of seafood dishes, all of which were excellent. But the crabs (black pepper and chili) were truly great- perfectly cooked and sauced. Seating is outdoor and informal, and service is fast and efficient. The ambiance is not the greatest- the place is on a very busy road and is noisy with lots of heavy trucks going by. But the food is worth the trip if you are in the area

Been here a few times and never had a bad experience once. Look for the Supervisor by the name of Ah Ting. She has more experience and speak many languages. The rest is just Mandarin. The crabs is a must try when visit this restaurant. The bean curd skin with prawns is also recommended. Overall the foods is more of a Malaysian style of cooking
