I love the grilled meats here.. I shared the meat platter with another 4 friends and the beef was just awesome. I had mutton as well, and was exceptionally tender and tantalizing. Will definitely be back for more!
3
Tried the grilled mushrooms w sea salt, chilli crab mantous, grilled pork &durian creme brûlée. Taste wise was not too bad, but didnt wowed us either. It would be good if the chilli crab dip was more chunky &if the pork was more tender.
4
Food was awesome, service was good. Decent ambience. If only prices werent so expensive, i would visit more often. At these prices,
4
Great angus steak on the board. The other crowd pleaser is the Lime Leaf Chicken and the rendang nachos. Go with a group so that you get to taste a variety of menu items.

So Glad that New Ubin seafood opened a pop up cafe in the east! Love the beef steak here. You'll never go wrong w the grilled items. Lovely lunch/dinner place w family. :)

Had the crispy pork jowl, portobello, and whole Norwegian mackerel, all of which were good, though not exceptional. The flat white that my friend ordered (dispensed from a machine, we were later told) was a great let-down: when it first came, the colour of the coffee was pale and watery; after we requested a change, the second cup that came was slightly better but still very diluted. Something should be done about this
5
The kids loved the tender and succulent meats of the Red Platter while the more health-conscious adults enjoyed the White Platter. Crispy Pork Jowl was our favourite. All desserts were great, with durian-lovers praising the Durian Crème Brulee. . A selection of Teas was a light refreshing option in the menu. Service was efficient. Location was tranquil. A downside is the small portions relative to price, which reduces the value.
4
The garang rice ($12++) did not impress despite the hype (I prefer the version from New Ubin Seafood) as the beef taste was diluted by the chilli; neither was the olive rice ($9++) impressive - seemed like something I could easily DIY. The carbonara ($18++) was also not up to expectations as I believe fresh cream was not used.That said, the grilled food (mains) which they specialise in were absolutely delicious - we had grilled mackerel ($28++), tiger prawn ($29++), and USDA prime rib-eye steak ($18++ per 100g). The mackerel was one of the best I've had. While I had to ask for the beef steak to be re-grilled (their "medium rare" was far too red that usual), the service staff happily obliged. The prawn was good as well, although it is probably too pricey for a repeat order as you get ONE prawn per serving.Location is really out of the way (although parking is free). I would gladly return just for the grilled meat alone :
4
Love their pork rendang nachos. It goes so well together. Only thing I can fault the dish is that there should be more pork rendang and nachos. Be careful eating this dish. It is really addictive.Chill crab rilletes is always good and likewise the prime rib eye. Tried the grilled mackerel and it was perfectly grilled. Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.Only flipside is that this place is a bit pricey for what you get
4
Now a pop up from New Ubin, we ordered the daily special burratina and the root veges which were fried in hae bi hiam and both were enjoyable although the latter was a tad too oily. The red meat platter comprised beef, lamb and pork served with mustard, pesto sauce and a slightly sticky gula Melaka mustard. The beef and lamb were wonderfully done but the pork was disappointingly dry. It was the only item not worth the cholesterol intake. For dessert we tried the durian Creme Brûlée which was delicious but rather small. The banana and kaya tart was average and the sticky pudding with salted caramel ice cream was so sugar laden that it somehow did not leave one yearning for more which the pudding from the old Slake did. Service was rather rushed towards the end of the meal as they were full and we were the first sitting. Overall quite expensive at $60 a pax without drinks.
4
Food was nice but think a little on the high side for atmosphere. Fois Gras and beef was very yummy.
3
rice bowls were very filling..
quite tasty but brown rice does not cater to everyone's palate..
pork cheek was a bit too fat (over 50%) & hence too artery clogging.. :)
3
Had lunch at Slake, Garang Grill. Food was good though rice was rather dry n hard. Service was average( not attentive).
4
A good initiative by Slake to have a pop-up at their location. Food was yummy, but prices tend to be a bit steep.
4
Great place to dine with your date. Unique selections of food, drinks and desserts. Friendly; good customer service!

Love the pop up restaurant of Garang Grill at Slake. Hope they will open a permanent outlet. Had the prime rib...it was lovely. Tender and juicy with just slightly over the top char. Had the caesar salad to cut through the chat and grease but would have preferred something without the creamy dressing that goes with the salad. I think a green salad made with ponzu or yuzu dressing would be perfect. The nasi garang that comes with the steak is nicely weighted and in the right proportion. Speaking of portion, the prime rib smallest was 450 gm. Not small indeed. I would suggest sharing it and try a few month of the starters. Overall....good value for the money

Garang Grill (Gastro Pub) is a pop up scion of one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore, New Ubin Seafood. We had lunch there on a Saturday afternoon. We started with Brewdog Punk IPA. So far so good. Then we had a favourite from the parent restaurant, poached egg with piping hot grilled foie gras. What's not to like? We followed with rendang nachos, crispy with a little heat but I wish the rendang had been pulled because the chunks of beef kept rolling of the chips. Then we had lime and chili giant prawn which were tender and not overcooked but not a hint of lime or chili was detected. Then we had raw oysters. We should have sent them back because they warm - but the first ones tasted OK. But the last one - the flavour was way off. We know to avoid the oysters in future. Service was perfectly fine. We paid S$144 for our lunch. There are many eateries in Siglap but almost all of them are mediocre at best. We're excited to see the entrance of a world class eatery into our neighborhood but the kitchen has a way to go to come up to the standard of the parent and to justify it's hefty price
5
The risk of knowing the original and finding out whether the branch serves the same standard. Glad to say we were not disappointed except the steak was slightly charred. The foie gras satay and mao shan wang creme brulee were to die for, and the 2 styles of salads were interesting for all of us
5
We had the Angus ribeye which came with the garang rice. Both were excellent and grilled to perfection. Grilled vegetables was a pleasant surprise. Never thought something so simple can taste so good. To finish off we had the Gula Melaka banana which gave the meal a perfect finishin
3
We went there for family dinner. Although the staff were pretty attentive and friendship, the food portion is relatively disappointing. As we have young children, the staff could have forewarned or initiated that the garang rice be made less spicy. It's a pity majority of rice was pretty left untouched
5
Fantastic fusion food with interesting flavours and quirky beer selection. A few misses but mostly hits.
4
Quality is just as good as our first visit. Will be back and try different dishes next time. Cozy and quiet ambiance
5
Wonderful food, very relaxed atmosphere and helpful friendly service.
A limited but very interesting menu, this eating place is one of the best I have eaten at in Singapore! Brilliant!!
3
The quality, taste and price was good but the menu was limited. E.g just one type of soup. Ambience is one of a neighborhood eatery.
4
A nice place to hang out with friends over beer and share some mains and starters. Food not mindblowing but above average.
4
Really good atmosphere and friendly helpful staff. Great place for us to meet friends at that end of the island.

This review is kinda late. Been wanting to write but always forgot. So we have been to Slake for about no less than 10 times because we had friends who kept wanting to return too. So a few dishes that we swear by like the rendang nachos. They are so good that we just cant remember no ordering it at any of our visits. We also absolutely love going on Mondays where they serve the Moo platters at an offer price. Moo Platter is a huge platter of all beef cuts and I gotta say it was heavenly. We always end off the dinner with the sticky date pudding with the bacon ice cream. Superb. Recently they started weekends brunch and we were there on one of the saturdays last month, we havent tried everuthing on the menu but the simple cheese toast stack was superb. pancakes also very very fluffy. Prices are not exactly the lowest but really, we are happy to pay for good food and a local business. It is obvious that the chef takes time to put some real effort into the food and he comes out at times to say hi at times. Gotta say he doesnt look like the man behind the food! A big surprise

We made reservations at the restaurant for dinner on a Sunday night. The off menu specials were already sold out by then, hence we ordered from the menu. The chicken wings were absolutely scrumptious! The beef rendang nacho chips was another hit, and we easily polished off everything. The waffles/pizza combo was a little odd though and didn't quite work for us. Overall, the dishes were interesting and tasty. I'd love to try out the rest of the menu
5
Located in a corner of the neighbourhood, this is a nice family own restaurant style and cosy environment which I really like. This is our first time visiting this place and we can say we will come back again. We tried the chili crab noodle and bbq pork ribs and both were excellent. Although the portion is considered small for the chili crab noodle, but the taste is unique and good for me. It could be noisy if it was crowded as the sound proofing was not well-done but still manageable as it was not full house. I would suggest to skip the dessert as the portion is small for its price
3
Small, quaint place with a pleasant atmosphere. Was great for a date night with my wife, until the food arrived. While the haloumi was extraordinary, three small pieces wasn't worth $18. Chilli crab noodles were mediocre while my chicken & waffles were sub-par - which would only be good on a golf course.
4
Very funny menu at this little restaurant Slake with amazing dishes such as waffles with bacon ice cream and slow cooked ribs and beef just unbelievable and just exceptional local fare
4
Awesome dining experience. Liked the deep fried waffles and the salted caramel bacon ice cream. Definetly will visit the restaurant again.
4
Good fusion food, wasn't disappointed at all. Must try the mackerel and date pudding! Place is small so reservation is a must.
4
There is a new menu from a year ago when i went. The service crew were friendly and the food was served promptly and beautifully. Will return again !
5
Big fans of Slake after our first visit last night. Food was a really pleasant surprise and there wasn't a thing that we didn't like. Beef rendang nachos, spring rolls, beef and pork ribs, sweet potato fries, chili crab pasta, and several great desserts. We kept saying out loud, "wow, this is another great dish," as we progressed through the night. Also had beer and wine which was pretty fairly priced (for Singapore). Service also quite attentive. Only minor points in terms of negatives: 1) seating area looks more like a deli or coffee shop, and 2) the chairs/benches were pretty hard as the time went on.
3
I love the location as it's away from the crowd but too difficult to get in. They have interesting food concept and they try to marry local and western dishes together.Some was done well but others were a missed for us. Overall, we will be back as the dining experience was good
5
I celebrated my boyfriend's birthday over a dinner at Slake - the staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout the dinner and even took the initiative to write 'happy birthday' on the dessert plate with an additional scoop of ice cream on the house! When we tried to order more dishes, instead of the typical process of hard-selling, the Slake staff kindly reminded us that the portions we ordered might be too large for just the two of us and provided refreshingly genuine recommendations throughout the night. I particularly enjoyed the honey butter wings and the spicy tomato soup! The sticky date pudding fell a little short for me, but the home made ice cream was creamy and delicious. Thank you, Slake, for the great dinner
4
The people working here have to be amongst the most friendly staff I have ever met while living in Singapore. Amazing. The food was good but not spectacular. The choice is relatively limited (which is something I usually like as this means the food is fresh). There's also some off the menu items with a special meat platter only on Mondays. Dessert was great. The red wine was a bit too warm but that's forgiven given the price. Alcohol in general was not too pricey. The area is also nice to walk around at night as it's very calm and relaxing. Next door is Baker & Cook and their pizzeria.
5
Our friends in the neighbourhood brought us here. This is western food with an Asian twist ....executed beautifully. Their sweet potato fries & marguerite waffle (cheese in waffle topped with bacon ice-cream are both executed well.We also has their stuffed squid, duck breast, and the most awesome ever mackerel. Finish your meal with a happy ending aka chocolate brownie (seriously good!!) We came with no expectations and left totally pleased
5
Food was good and service was excellent. Yunny was very helpful and attentive. She overheard my comment that the mackerel could do with a pinch of salt and immediately brought me the salt shaker. I would recommend the Rendang Nachos, Angus beef, Gula Malacca ribs, smoked mackerel and bacon ice-cream
4
Our third visit to here but sadly they have taken prosecco by the glass off the drinks list. The only house white was an ordinary Chardonnay. But great food.
4
Hidden away in a suburban residential area of Singapore, bring your favourite people and enjoy the menu! It's small and surprising but worth the taxi ride into the expat quarter to find it. Delicious!

I am a steak lover but I find the steak a little too dry. Not really tasty. Yes good for quantity, not really for quality. Have to book in advance.
5
Very good food and well presented.
The location was very quite and the environment very friendly to make this place ideal for any occasion.

My partner was quite vocal about his thoughts on Slake. We had booked but arrived half an hour early so shown to a small table for 2 with wooden log stools to sit on. Not comfortable. Partner not impressed with the limited seating area straight away or with the cafe style set up as there was no music and we were sat next to a very loud work group who had been drinking. We ordered a beer and soft drink but were not brought water at any point despite glasses set on the table. We decided to order tomato soup and crab rillettes to start which we were told were fried bread. Well, it was a crab paste accompanied by 4 mini fried sweet doughnuts.... It just wasn't a good match for the savoury pate and we left it. The tomato soup was hot and tasty and good value for $5 but my main dish arrived before we had finished it with my partners some five minutes later.I had ordered the pork ribs which had a nice BBQ taste but served with some uninspiring blobs of brown and beige coloured paste that offered little in the way of either a carb side or a sauce. There were some petai beans and some purple slaw with some scone like biscuits. The pork was nice but the accompaniments just not very nice to taste. My partner barely touched his meal as his 'medium' steak came out chewy and slimy looking. No steak knife provided. His meat was accompanied by warm sweet potato which he ate but he left the steak which was also accompanied by a thick brown blob of something. I feel mean to be so negative but for the price of the mains at $35 a dish the food just didn't warrant the spend. We left shortly after and spent just an hour there in total... The waiter asked my partner how his steak was as he had left it but even after my partner said it was not good, very poor, the waiter just said sorry and came back with the bill. I know this is a fusion restaurant but the dishes we tried just didn't make sense and were wasted. Hate to be so negative but we would not go back again. Sorry Slake!

Nice little restaurant tucked in the middle of a residential estate. Food is great and the have Guinness Draft on tap. Had the Lamb Shank and Stuffed Squid- both were done uniquely. The sticky date pudding with salted caramel ice-cream is awesome stuff. Casual and relaxed environment.
5
Usually when I hear fusion, I run for the hills, but Slake is the exception. Every change to a classic serves to truly enhance the flavor. This requires an incredible amount of restraint and top notch execution. The pork ribs and Norwegian mackerel were phenomenal. Look out for the occasional Sunday roast - it is to die for. And for dessert - bacon infused ice cream on sticky date pudding. Heavenly.
5
Like the cozy ambience and thoroughly enjoyed the dinner. What we ordered -- BBQ Pork Ribs, Guinness Lamb Shank, Stuffed Squid, US Angus Beef, Olive Rice, Salad, Spicy Sweet Potato Fries; Crispy Waffle and Salted Caramel Ice Cream for Dessert.For the meat -- Pork Ribs, Lamb Shank and Angus Beef -- done to perfection in the chef's hand i.e. succulent, tender and favor of the meet retained and you know what you are eating. Stuffed Squid -- squid cooked just right and together with the moist stuffings, every bite is "oishi". Olive Rice is a must try -- loads of chopped olives and has a light spiciness to it. Fries not oily -- good (not a fries person).Dessert -- great end to cap the meal.Based on the amount of effort put into the preparation of the dishes, you know that the cooks are committed and passionate to serve only the best at your table.Cost? $$$ for 5 persons and a glass of beer.Will definitely revisit with family, good friends and...not so good friends. Really..

It's our first vist and we found a personalized reservation tag on the assigned table interesting. The sous vide Angus beef was good. Expresso was rather acidic. Table seating was tight. Average price for a 3 course meal with 2 drinks was sgd $50 per pax

Have had a a few visits, and the food seems to improve. Had the Guiness lamb shank, Norwegian mackerel, a number of the lunch noodles, etc. The truffle sweet potato fries have a perfect consistency of crispy, crunchiness to taste... not to mention saltiness. Our favorite is the mackerel. It's really an interesting blend of local flavors. We're no food experts but the taste keeps us intrigued, and wondering about the other items on the menu. The drinks are a good spread of beer, wine and whisky. And we didn't realize there's no gst or service tax.... We will continue to frequent the restaurant ...
