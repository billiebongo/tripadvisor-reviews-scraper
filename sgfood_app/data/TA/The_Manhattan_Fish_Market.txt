Near our office with a colleague from Indonesia. Service was friendly, food was fresh and tasty. I find pricey, considering the other options available.
4
This restaurant is located inside plaza Singapura. Nice decoration, good atmosphere. Waiting time is long but foods are great especially seafood. Foods are better than the one from Myanmar. Check out the photos.

Delivered by Deliveroo, cold, soggy, tasteless fish (dory and cherry snapper) The chips were undercooked, we threw them away straight away. Overall a waste of money and a waste of a fish's life..Never ever again...
4
We had a platter for two which comes with the prawn, fish, garlic rice, Fries and garlic butter sauce and it had enough for 2 persons. Nicely grilled every dishes and service is quite fast as well. Nice seafood restaurant.
5
Service staff were all friendly and have a genuine smile to us. Food were served hot and fresh. It was a very pleasant late lunch.
3
Quick service.we ordered fish,vegetarian pasta,mushroom fried. Only 1 option for vegetarian main course :( The pasta use too much cream.too thick cream.the fish tasted so so.but their mushroom fried taste delicious.

Ordered for late lunch one Sunday from their outlet in Hougang Mall. Food arrived within 30 mins and it retained its quality.Try their Grilled Glory Dory. It comes with a large cut of dory fillet, herbed and spiced rice plus a good serving of fresh and firm veggies of broccoli and carrots. Nice meal for 1 person.The 2 sauces that came with it are perfect matches - one is spicy for that added zing and another is garlic herb which is creamy and tangy. Try combining them for a surprise on your taste buds.MFMâ€™s menu is a definite winner for lunch or late afternoon snack of fish and chips and the like.Worth successive dining chances in the near future

So as usual we made our way back again to Manhattan fish market and i found that it really taste better than Fish & Co. lolx just the preference.We order several dishes and they always taste awesome and must try Salmon n Chip OMG it taste heaven.I really like the affordable meals and deals @ Manhattan Fish Market and keep it up guys
4
Tried them a few times and they meet my expectations of a casual joint serving fried seafood. We ordered a platter to share on our last visit and it was great. All the fried battered seafood was done nicely, crispy, hot and not greasy, it was also served on a huge mountain of french fries that we took away.My only issue was that so little boiled vegetable was served, they could be more generous and give a bit more which would be nice. Otherwise the sauces that came were all really good.Staff were very attentive, friendly and cheerful
4
Had a hearty lunch here with my daughter. The service was fast and the fish was cooked perfectly to our liking. It is not greasy and the proportion is big. My daughter loved the cheesy sauce on her fries. My garlic rice was also good. The dipping sauce which is a little bit chili paired along well with both the fish and chicken we ordered. It was a delightful first time experience, am really satisfied.
2
Visited on a weekday late lunch 1 plus pm. There was only one chef working. Waited for 40 mins for the standard set lunch fish and chips. The fillet was thin and dry. The fries were overcook and dry. Won't come back to this place.
4
Good food at reasonable prices with space to have a chat with friends but the service can be improved with quicker and more attentive
5
The Manhattan Fish Market is the best place to sample American-/Mediterranean-style seafood. The quintessential Fish-&-Chips to the lip-smacking calamari and prawns are all served with herbed rice. If you visit in a big group, try their big platters.

One would be spoilt for choice at this restaurant. It is a haven for seafood lovers. Crabs, fishes, squids, mussels, prawns.... must visit

Came to this restaurant on a Thursday afternoon for lunch with my friend. We were looking for a place serving a hearty meal and an atmosphere that would allow us to talk without feeling like we were shouting to get our point across the din. I ordered the fishy chicky bang bang which consisted of a breaded chicken and fish fillet joined together by cheese, served with salad and fries on the side. My set meal came with ice lemon tea and a small mac n cheese. My friend ordered the Salmon Penne. My food was okay, but i daresay its quality lacks consistency. My mac n cheese was served lukewarm whereas it would have been idea to have it piping hot. There was very little cheese in my dish and the salad wss horribly bitter. But the fish and chicken tasted decent. My friend's salmon penne was creamy but tasted very bland as if the kitchen staff had forgotten to add salt to the pasta.The food is somewhat disappointing, but the price isnt exuberant and the atmosphere is decent if you want a lively place to catch up with your friend in town. Service was responsive and respectful.
3
This outlet is bright, plenty of seating and efficient staff.Had lunch today (Wednesday) - ordered the Summer Shroom salad adding a side of crispy whitebait plus a side of crispy chips.The salad was actually quite tasty - I enjoyed that very much however the side of crispy whitebait was a sprinkle of tiny pieces of batter over the top of the salad, virtually no flavour and certainly not deep fried whitebait - very disappointing - hardly worth the extra $3.00. Was expecting a bowl of crispy whitebait similar in size the chips.A generous side of crispy chips came in a bowl were quite tasty
3
We were here for lunch. My wife ordered dory fish and chips while I ordered a salmon sandwich. The waitress came back apologizing for being out of salmon so I ordered the chicken fish combo. My wife loved hers while I thought mine was just ok
3
Started with fried Calamari; a bit cold but still ok. Main dish is Salmon cooked in Mediterranean way with rice and vegetables; again vegetables were a bit cold, however the salmon and rice were tasty.Overall average score as the portions vs. price is only average.Staff were ok
1
Been there a few times but still disappointed by the slow and efficient service of the Malay staff working there. The food is nice and I like eating there even is small portions and quite expensive. Ever has a few episodes of bad experience with the service staff there as they can be rude and has attitude problem.i went with my friends of 4 that day and we wanted to order .There were many waitress there but no one attended to us .and then even they serve us they talk like quite fast and hack care. Also when the kids accidentally touch their counter they gives rude stares.Really a pity .coz of their poor and inefficient attitude we might never eat there again

This restaurant belongs to a Franchise that is spreading across Asia and specialises in sea food. It’s amazing just how many ways they can cook any sort of fish or marine delicacy. This one is on the one of top floors of Plaza Singapura in Orchard Road. Don’t be surprised if after you have meandered up the various escalators you find that there is a queue at MFM (Manhattan Fish Market). It is that popular. The staff are great - watch for the ‘sayings’ on their backs. The food is magnificent and is of a generous serving. The place caters for all tastes. It is very clean and well worth every cent, as well as the effort to get there. Take your time and go shopping as you head down to the lower floor after your meal
5
I have had food in many branches of this restaurant and I have like all of them. I would say it's a paradise for sea food lovers. If you are a vegetarian please avoid it.
2
the fish and chips were mediocre at best and the service nothing to rave about. the 1 for 1 deals were not really worth it. it might be a different story if we didn't use the coupons but then why offer something different.
4
surprisingly the cream of mushroom soup is so delicious. You can order the fried giant platter n try the difference deep fried food. and i had try the cala cala n the gummy bear is wonderful.
4
Went there as a family group . Food was OK . Service a bit slow.One staff member was sitting at a table during his break having a sleep. Not a good look.
5
Ideal location at SUNTEC City, Singapore. Many varieties of sea food. The portions are huge. We, 3 persons shared 1 meal. Plan your order. The menu is very helpful. The price is worth it for the place & type of food. Service is fast. Worth it to try new types of seafood
4
Went to one of its outlets with my mom and my sister for lunch. I had Da Bomb and it was da bomb. The service was a little slow but it's not that noticeable. They were friendly and got everything right. Overall, it was a nice lunch.
3
Manhattan did wow me the first few times when I went there to eat. But after a while, I feel that it was too oily for me, especially the fried fish. Nowadays, I would usually eat the grilled fish with rice which is supposedly to be more healthy.
2
I went to this place for late lunch. I agreed with below reviews that service wasn't attentive here. -Cherry Seabass was bad, stale and not fresh. -Garlic Herb Rice was hard as coarse sand and insipid. -Steam Broccoli and carrot was hard rock. -Mushroom soup was a potato soup with weird taste. (Fried shrimp, Grill squid, fries and lemon juice was good.) I wish, I never came here. Wasted my daily calories.
3
Went there with my 2 children after lunch time at about 3 pm, so the restaurant is about one third full with quite a few staff, so my expectation for the service should be fast and efficient, since the staff should be free but no.I am ignored after being shown to my table. People came after me got to ordered first.The cutleries are only served after the first dish came, based on the number of person and the type of food we ordered. So when my chicken came, I need to chased them for the cutting knife because I am only given the knife for fish which is not sharp enough to cut the chicken.I think this is the most basic service for which the staff just go through the motion thinking every customer would ordered fish.Moreover I need to pay for the 10% service charge?Singapore always like to be world's best and number 1 but not in services losing out to surrounding developing and developed countries
4
We just dropped in for Dinner one night as we craved some normal fish and chips. This place did not disappoint with fresh, moist fish, great salad and chips. The drinks are a must to try. Service was a bit slow in getting the order but we were in no rush.and the smiles of the team made up for that
5
Enjoyed a great lunch. The fish was outstanding. The Green bean dishes are the best I have ever had. Would order again. Also enjoyed all of the Dim Sum.
4
I dine here regularly with my family at the Bedok Point outlet.
Our favourite dishes - Manhattan Flaming Seafood Platter and Mediterranean Baked Fish.
Our favourite drinks - Cala Cala and Tropical Breeze.
The staff are very friendly and attentive and the service is good.
4
Like always they are the best. Yummy food for regular eating. Just choose any combo menu that surely meet your appetite.
5
Have live show when you order the flaming item. Signature item will be Sharing platter for 2 person and this for sharing 2 to 3 person.
5
Very nicely cooked and served with delicacy. The price is bit on higher side but the serving for one person is very good.
1
We had lunch at the outlet at City Square Mall ... soup was cold ... sent it back and it returned the same way ... chips were undercooked .. service unfriendly and unhelpful ... so sorry we came ... worst place in Singapore ...
4
Food was ok. However service was fantastic. Waiters were very attentive and prompt unlike some big establishments where getting the waiters attention is the biggest challenge
3
Just had lunch there with the family and ordered four items. We had the salmon and dory fish and chips, the glory island (onion rings, fried dory fish and salad on rice), the isle of bait (dory fish with sambal, deep fried white bait, coleslaw and chips on rice) and a tempura beef burger.The various fish dishes were good and tasty, and we especially loved the chips which were crisp on the outside and fluffy within.The tempura beef burger was the last dish to arrive. While the beef patty itself was okay, and the four tempura fried prawns were succulent, the bun was hard, and difficult to cut even with a knife. The brown sauce that was on top was also a let down. Figures right - should not have ordered a burger in a fish restaurant.Service was okay, and the lady server readily brought extra sauces to our table on request. I liked the chipotle sauce, with its strong taste of hickory BBQ taste, while my mom liked their tartare

“Q: Why do fish refuse to join Facebook? A: They’re scared of the NET!”“Life is short, eat dessert first”“The Codfather...”One of my favourite pastimes in the restaurant while waiting for the food to arrive at our table was to look for clever sayings (yah, clever especially if in context) like the above teasers printed on the restaurant serviettes or brochures.My friend and I met for lunch at The Manhattan Fish Market@Hougang Mall on 18 Feb 16; we opted for the Gala Seafood Platter comprising grilled fish fillet, prawns, cuttlefish, mussels, broccoli, carrot, rice and bread for sharing between the two of us (“Platter”: OK; “Gala”:??).The food was prepared and served by a team of youthful staff, who impressed us deeply with their friendliness, courteousness, helpfulness and efficiency. They were gently attentive towards customers’ needs, without being jarring or overwhelming in response. The thick menus showed the wide variety of seafood, desserts and other food choices available to customers.We were able to decide where to seat ourselves; thus, we were fully relaxed and comfortable from the start while enjoying the food and watching the passers-by. I must say the mussel and grilled fish-fillet were wonderfully satisfying. Nice outing experience indeed
4
Good selection of seafood, good presentation, good flavor. When staying in the Pan Pacific this restaurant is nicely located in the adjacent mall. Open seating can make it a bit loud but that adds to the family environment. Watch as the seafood is flame broiled at the table with a chefs torch. Do order your drinks with the food or you will have to grab a waiter flying by to get a beverage
5
the king crab was great, was an expirience for us, we visit the Manhatan fish market 3 times and tasted some of their best plates. The Plaza was crowdy but not hard to get a table, very profecional staff. picture attached.
4
We only stipend in for a late lunch snack , at the sinter location, and found this to be above average , very tasty, salads were very complimentary to the seafood, not to expensive and the service was quick and efficient
3
The food so so only not to the standard and the service was slow. I would not go back again even they have promotion next time.
5
Food there is really delicious and fresh thats why a lot of people eat there.and the price not really expensive like $10 up really nice and great food for sure you will love and enjoy☺
5
Food is served hot and the seafood was all fresh. Quite affordable and service was good. everything was fast and efficient.

To be fair, it's not plaza singapore that I visited but the franchise in Bishan.Having visited Bangkok for 5 days of awesome Thai/Asian cuisine it's time for a change ..... N walking past a staff. She produced to sell the fish menu to me. Why not ? Since fish & chips one of my favourite in Melbourne n London.I decided to order a combo, fish n chips with mushrooms. ViIt didn't take long to arrive. Tried the chips & it tastes ... Not right n not before long I realised the chips were cooked at the outside but internally, the potato itself wasn't really cooked. The staff could sense something was wrong. She did come forward but I told her ... Not to worry because I am not a big big fan of chips but simply told her, the chips weren't cooked. Fish ... A small fish but I could see oil ... Oil on the battered piece of fish. Most disappointing of the lot.Mushrooms were a delight. Other than that, guys good luck & no, I won't be back.

I really wouldn't recommend anyone to come here or to any of their other outlets. There are plenty of similar places with probably better food and service than this place. They took more than 20 minutes to serve soup, and nearly 30-40 mins to serve the main course. The manager did not bother apologizing or looked apologetic when I asked (nicely) about the soup after 20 minutes. Even when I was making payment for my meal, she didn't bother to smile or even say thank you. The food was mediocre - as always. Just...don't come here

Saw today's announcement in sph Special Edi of the Asia Top Brand 2015 & saw the promo $9.90 for Flaming Lobster so drove to dine in Hougang Mall levrl 4 branch. So we ordered 2 lobsters but to our great disappointment, they were Bamboo Lobsters which were so miniscule in size. I reckon generally the public would think that Boston Lobsters are served unless stated otherwise. I think for such a big company such as TMFM, to be ripped off wt such ads is unbelievable in this day & age. It's like daylight robbery & i couldnt believe my eyes that the management dares to do such distasteful gimmick. At least, print it on the same ad to be transparent to the public & not done in a covert manner. Would i ever trust the company's future ads, perhaps the management can live wt such utter nonsence but not the decent & innocent public. By the way, i would like to thank Sheila, Ida & Erica for the pleasant services rendered. Chong, who kindly did the flaming of the 2 lobsters could be better if only he gave more smiles bcos he looked quite fierce if he didnt. Management have to do the right thing if ever they want to retain & rekindle our faith in the company & branding. This dinner was upsetting & a big disservice
4
The food there served was practically tasting better than the food I ate in other outlets. No idea why? Loved the the prawn, tasted great.The staff kept forgetting to bring certain dishes but was child friendly.I had instructed them to bring the drinks halfway thru my meal, but they brought it even before any of my meal appeared on my table.Overall good experience
2
Went to the Junction 8 branch on a Saturday night for dinner - I had a Grill Glory Dory ($12.95) that tasted only pretty normal like what I would get at a food court's western cuisine stall. The vegetables were pretty raw, and the portion was very small. The waffle fries were quite OK, but the fish tasted more like sutchi fillet rather than dory fish.The water (ice/warm) is chargeable at $0.50 a cup, so be forewarned.The seats were packed so tight that you are always within earshot of the next table's patrons (would give them a 2 out of 5 for the ambiance).Almost 15 minutes after we arrived, a queue started forming at the restaurant - I wonder what and why these people would queue for given the food is only mediocre. I'd probably only go back to this restaurant only if all the other sit-down restaurants were closed for the day.The service was also nothing special - in fact they were packed so full that the servers started lapsing on the table service
4
Has a good variety of fish. I liked spicy one. Really enjoyed.
Very neat place. Good service. Drinking Water is chargeable. No drinks served.
4
I liked dining at this restaurant. I have dined about 5 times in a yr. The staff are friendly and courteous. they are helpful. I like most of the set dishes. they are affordable.
4
Good and decent food. Wont say there is any negativity in any of the dishes I have tasted but I feel it is slightly overpriced. Those who thinks they can afford a little more can get
3
Tried to dine at this restaurant in their Raffles City branch using coupons. Ordered 2 Small Flames (grilled shrimp, fish fillet, rice, fries) at a discounted price (approx. $21) and we waited almost an hour for our main dish. The servers seemed to forget about it until we followed up our order. The place was not full and the dish was not hot when served.The dish was promising though as the cheese was melted using a torch blower right before it was set down the table. The serving for the small flame was considerably large and filling. If only our order came while we still have our appetite then we would 've enjoyed it more
1
Visited the Star Vista outlet, disappointed as we kept choosing items off the menu only to be told not available. Wait stuff wasn't the least apologetic and kept sniggering as she related that items are not available. When requested for plain water, was told that each is chargeable at $0.50. The least they could have done is to offer the plain water for free after all the disappointments.
2
Have not been to MFM for some time so thought of coming here.Wanted to have their Dory battered fish until i saw other interesting menu.Settled with a tiger prawn with mussels and fish curry.Conclusion: prawn is not fresh. Mussels v small. Fish ok. Curry on the salty side (to be fair i dun eat too salty).Portion does not live up to the price.Ice lemon tea's price did not seem to be indicated on the ala carte menu. Ended up paying 3.90 instead of 1.95 when purhcased w promo set meal for tt pathetic drink
1
The service in this place is absolutely upsetting !!!!We waited outside for about 20 mins when there are plenty seats available, no one was running the seating at all. There are about 5 staff on the floor doing don't know what, running around doing nothing, and keeps all the customer waiting outside. We finally got in, as we had a food voucher including two main meal and two soft drinks, we asked for one coke and one sprite ( as I'm 8 mths pregnant and really didn't want to have coke) , we've been surprisingly told we can't change our drinks, if it's written on the voucher as coke regardless we will have to have coke. Unbelievably stupid!!!! I had no idea what's the difference of putting out a drink from the freaking same machine. And we explained to the so called " manager" the reason of why we want to change one drink, he totally ignored the reason of pregnancy and stayed with his stupid rule. Absolutely disappointed 
4
Me n wifey went in today for dinner. Not tht busy and we were promptly seated by a service staff. She waited till my wife prepared to order. Whn the food arrive,she even brought out sauces,even before being asked. Her name is Zalina. Kudos team. You got a great service person
3
Had lunch at the Suntec branch with the missus. Stopped by to look at the menu and was greeted by Dada (a young Malay girl). She very patiently answered all my questions and smiled throughout. Even when I told her we would continue looking around she happily thanked me. After walking a round of Suntec we decided to go back and eat here. Dada greeted us like old friends and gave us a nice corner table for 4 even though we were only 2 people. The place was pretty crowded as you would expect at lunchtime.Being the person I am, I observed the goings on in the restaurant and noted that the staff were very efficient, walked around purposefully and served everyone quickly and mostly with a smile. I was most impressed with Sunil. He didn't dawdle, didn't slouch, walked quickly to wherever he was needed and served quickly. I assume he isn't from Singapore as his accent was a bit different, but he had no problems understanding me and I had no problems with his english. Bearing in mind the place was very busy I think the service crew did a very good job.So the service is great!The food though..... hmmmm. I had the grilled cod with chips and coleslaw. Chips were OK, coleslaw was not bad. But the fish was not good. It had clearly been in the freezer a while and had no taste. The cod flakes looked impressive but the colour of the flakes was a shiny translucent hue, not the bouncy white one would expect with good cod. The flakes also fell away quite easily. Another sign it wasn't so fresh. So taste and texture not befitting the service received. Would I go back? If it were purely on service then yes. And if I do, then I will stay away from the grilled cod.I would also suggest that they make their milkshakes a bit smaller. They are good but so filling and even I couldn't finish the whole glass
3
Had lunch at their Juntion 8 outlet and chose theirbaked spicy fish value set.This set consists of soup of the day, a main course anda soft drink.Tried their baked spicy fish value set meal. This is a baked dory fish fillet in a sour,tangy &spicy gravy. This somewhat like an assam pedasdish. So unless you like assam pedas fish, then itis fine.The dish comes with steamed rice, brocolli, carrots &a wedge of lemon. With a sor & tangy gravy, the lemonis redundant.I expected a baked fish with spicy sambal or sauce.You are greeted at the entrance & escorted to your table.Service is polite & prompt.There is a student & senior citizen discount of $2 off the price.Food rating : 5 out of 10 points
3
Great $3.95 fish & chips deal although restaurant felt rather dirty. I also noticed a type of small bug flying around which are normally found in unclean bathrooms.
4
Loved the flaming cheesy grilled fish! Enjoyed the rosemary herb rice.. portion was just nice and i was full by the end of the meal. Favourite starter was definitely THE COUNTRY FRIED MUSHROOMS!!! yum!!!!!!! The sauce was a perfect combi!
3
Had a dinner with my wife. Ordered fish and chips, the price is okay, service is not that fantastic but fish was so oily..
Not recommendable at all.
3
This chain is in many heartland (suburban) shopping malls in Singapore on the MRT line, so is an easy option when you get tired of local fare.The share plates are good value with a little bit of everything and a variety of dips. The battered mushrooms and whitebait which you can order as sides are very moreish. Worth trying is the iced Lemon Grass tea which has a hint of lychee - a lovely refresher after a day of shopping
3
They have decent food. Nothing negative in any of the dishes. My daughter loves their seafood aglio olio & we visit them regularly for that dish alone. But the rest of the food is quite good too. Service is on & off. Depends on certain individuals who serve you. As we go regularly, we have a fair idea whom to approach. The staff is young & so not well informed. But in the current labour shortage situation that is not something we can avoid. I would have given it 4 stars, but for the prices. The prices are definitely far above the quality of food & level of service.
4
Great seafood dishes. I got a very good deal with Boston lobster at $19.90. Though the lobster were not fresh, it was delicious. The staff was also very nice when giving me access to their Wifi network. Cards are accepted. Reasonable price at about $30 per person
2
My first impression of this resturant is very average. I was at their Century Square branch with the service staff did not bother to come and offer us a sit. When we ask for service, the service staff reluctant to come over lead us to our sit.Food wise, it is very oily and over power with sauce.My suggestion is to order the grill fish with less sauce.Average cost per person is SGD20+
3
Over S$80 for 3 with a small lobster the food was average at Changi City Point whereas the food served at Jurong point was more flavorful with their famous blachan ( fermented shrimp paste) mixed with lemon juice and tamarind. Service was ok at both outlets. I highlighted that the squid, dory and scallop dish with coconut and turmeric gravy should be improved as I can't taste it infused into the seafood as I can still taste the flat boiled taste of seafood. This dish did not satisfy my dinner pangs.
2
At the Tampines outlet for a quick lunch.My friend and I ordered the 'Fishy Cheeky Bang Bang and Feeesh n' cheese' set @ $13.95.A promotional set for two.Restaurant was not too crowded and we were able to place our order relatively prompt.Ice water is chargeable at 50 cents per glass. My fish meal was swimming in oil. and cheese fries a wee bit soggy.Not too tasty.Don't think I will be back for more
3
We patronized the City Square Mall outlet, and had the Manhattan Fish n' Chips, the Fishy Chicky Bang Bang, and the Crabby Fish Burger. On the plus side; pricing was about alright and portions sizing were reasonable for diners who care about volume. The chips/fries though didn't taste crispy, and the two main fish meals were a little too oily for us. Service was rather aloof. The orders were also served some time apart, which meant you either wait for the others' orders to come and accept your food less hot, or you start first before the rest
3
This place is a little strange, in one way you feel like you're in a fast food joint with table service. yes, the food is way better than fast food! If you like fish and need to budget, give it a go
4
We came here just by chance as we are hungry. Got a seat and was attended within seconds by San and an older lady. San took our orders and diligently around when needed. Good job team PS. Happy belly, very happy.
2
We were there for Lunch before shopping at the mall. We had to wait for service staff to attend and when we placed our order, staff looked impatient with. We had to ask for water to be served and drink took so long to be served. We liked the food and service when we visit in 2014 but now the standard is dropping
2
The food is only so so ....and little costly .....with a serving of a small dory fish and small egg in a small servings ....also the one at yishun the service is terrible...the fat malay staff was kinda rude...i wanted to sit in a corner and she wanted to give me an outside seat without any privacy...when i insists she show a black face....and then when we were seated in a corner she push in the table and hit one of us delibrately so i complain to supervisor and they keep asking which staff.and keep walking to our side wana offset a meal but i have my rite to decide yes or no ..its so annoying the whole experience,the meal wasnt enjoyable
4
Came with my 2 girls as we love eating fish especially from Manhattan Fish Market in Bugis+. Paul Forrester waited our table & he was really tip top good. He was courteous, cheerful, competent & caring. He knows his products well, at his finger tips, & recommended the promo & ala carte dishes compassionately. Every dish & beverage were served promptly & correctly in the right sequence. Every bite was good, fresh fish meat, adequate greens & matching sauces. We also like the interior deco which is soothing to the eyes. The premise was clean, bright & spacious. Price was just right since they were air-flown. As long as the food is fresh & cooked correctly for consumption, we are contented. Every factor was good ie product, place, people & price. We shall definitely return again particularly to this branch. Paul Forrester made the whole dining experience a definitely good one.
3
Food was much better than fish and Co. The pricing was also reasonable. The seafood platter for 2 was worth it. Nearly can't finish up the whole platter. The melted prawn was quite nice and fresh.But they don't served ice water which I was quite annoyed. Can't understand why is it so. Even we order some drinks already. They still charge for ice water.
5
Usher Ana, was prompt & courteous throughout our dining experience. One of our tables was shaking unevenly but one lady staff got it settled promptly, very nice of her. Order taken was quick & polite. Dishes arrived promptly & Eric was hospitable, even explained the different sauces in the oysters. The fish were deliciously cooked to perfection. All in all, we enjoyed good service rendered by every staff, good food prepared & cooked by the kitchen team, & value for money. Kudos to management for ensuring all these important factors for a good dining experience
2
After hearing some good reviews and referrals I decided to check this out. In fact, I went to the one in Changi City Point and ordered Fish and Chips from À la carte lunch menu. I must say that I was completely disappointed by the quality of the fish that they used. Better not to try them, at least the Fish & Chips again
4
Manhatten Fish Market is a well-known chain of restaurants specialising in scrumptious fish dishes cooked in every way imaginable. This one is a bit of a challenge to get to being on the top floors of Plaza Singapura but it is certainly worth the effort. You can often expect to queue and wait for a table but again that is worth the wait. It’s that good.I first noticed the franchise in Bali but it wasn’t till this Singapore trip that we tried it. Turns out that we should have done it ages ago. We ended up making the run to the Plaza a couple of times for dinner. There will be no further hesitation on trying Manhattan Fish Market outlets wherever we see them now. The food is great, the serves are a reasonable size, Service is great and the cost is well worth it
2
I have tried the Manhattan Fish Market twice and it has disappointed me twice. The food served are not really authentic, like it just tastes bland. The grilled chicken and pasta I ordered were hard and tasteless. Environment is also chaotic. The service was bad too as the staff were busy and had a bad attitude. Overall, the food is not authentically Western, kind of like a Asian style perception of Western food. Not coming back anymore
5
had dine there last saturday, it's my son's birthday, so we decide to dine there, the foods are very nice and reasonable price.
1
Rock hard potatoes, tasteless rice balls, soggy prawns.... My one and only visit to this place has left me so traumatized that I would think twice about going into other similar seafood restaurants. Bad memories!!!
3
Came here on a Monday night and it was packed. Service was very poor. Waiters did not even give us plates. We ordered some special promotion which was for 4 adults. The food was good and not too expensive considering the promotion.
5
Alwaya have great service, the food is always yummy and fresh as well, good place to dine in with friends or family... i always go there eat because it's just so good!!

I always have good impression of this restaurant because of the long queue. To my astonishment, the overall experience was terrible and I really doubt I will recommend anyone or even come back again. We had a coupon that allows one for one and thought it was really worth the spending. Four of us were hungry then and managed to ordered one for one platter. When the food was served, it tasted like ad though the platters had been left overnight. The chips are not even better than any of the fast food. The fish was tasteless and the rice was terrible. I plead to the management to seriously look into the problem.Regard

City Square Mall outlet - The side salad that comes with the main course are pre-prepare into small plastic bowls which it not unusual. However, those that was serve to my table was totally unacceptable. My wife did not check and after mixing with the dressing started to consume them. But felt the vegetable was soft and tasted funny. I took a look into mine and was disgusted as the lettuces are all wet, black and soggy on the bottom. Demanded to see the manage and to my surprise the answer was "all the salad are the same". Request to see the chef but was told that there is no chef available. Paid my bills and left the place feeling disgusted
3
Didn't appreciate waiting for a ling time for main course to arrive. Dishes came out at many minutes intervals between each of us. When mine arrived, it came with soggy fries . I sent it back and they replaced it with much better crispy fries but it meant more time ..... Didn't like that whole experience

Went for a quick meal a week back as my son was very hungry. Had never been to one of their restaurants before. After the visit, I never ever will. Went to the Marina Square outlet. Took them more than 30 minutes to get a fish burger. Asked the staff twice and they said its on they way. But it turned out that either no one bothered to check with the kitchen or they just forgot. Walked out of the restaurant and refused to pay for the burger. The staff is just so disinterested
2
We had our first meal in Singapore here and was quiet disappointed. $The service was slow and the meals took over 30 mins to come out. We ordered the Small Grill 20SGD and the Chick, mussels & calamari 18SGD 2 cokes 7SGD total of 45SGD then we were slammed 7%GST and a Service charge of 4.50SGD for service that was terrible. The food was not the best either, and from the poor service we will not eat here again and not recommend it

Went to the Bedok Point branch to celebrate MUM'S birthday. First time trying the Manhattan Fish Market.Interesting menu to choose from. Service was not bad though special requests were not followed through. Brother did not want any cream on his prawns and fish. He had informed the waitress as well as write on the order form. However the dish came with the cream. He was very disappointed.Other than that, food was pretty good and everyone enjoyed it. The mud pie was yummy
2
Lousy value for money. They even charge you S$0.50 for a cup of water. That is after spending more than S$15 for the fish dish. Fish is small and average. I will not come back again.
1
I have never seen such bad service and such chaotic, lazy incompetent staff. stay away! Pity because the food is actually ok.
1
Bad service and chaotic organisation at Marina Square branch. No signs or instructions on queuing for takeaway or dine-in. Ordered fish and chips and realised staff had not taken order when checking with them after waiting for about 30 mins. Staff mentioned that if I wanted to order, it would be another 30-45 mins wait. I left because I can't spend all my lunch hour waiting for food
3
We went there for a quick and early dinner and were greeted by friendly staffs. We had dory lite fish n chips which came with soup of the day. The waiting time was reasonable and the fish inside the coating was tender and quite juicy. The soup of the day was nicely done and loved it. We tried fried country mushroom too and I like the fact that the portion of salad that came with it was generous. Their mocktail was very refreshing. For the price, we find it a bit pricy
1
Me and wifey tried again for the 2nd time going to your outlet at Century Square. Order the platter for 2. The soup came promptly after ordering. The main course subsequently came after I ask the server,Wanying. And tht is after 15mins lapse. It came fast with no sauce and the prawns not flamed. Whn I ask if she forget our order, she just walk away. Pity for the service industry even if its a fast food
3
I went there for a second time, for lunch rather than dinner this time. It was busy as usual as it seems to be a very popular place. Nevertheless, I was alone and was seated promptly. I ordered a fish and ship which, along with a soft drink, came out to S$17.85 with tax and service, which is quite reasonable. The fries were OK but the fish was undercooked. Service was prompt and efficient
4
I love their choices of fishes. Some spicy some are not. I love the choices of sauces they put in the fishes. And ofcourse their dessert! They have a dessert that is in a sizzling plate. A combination of hot and cold dessert in a sizzling plate. Very unique and tasty. That is why there are always many people in their restaurant.
2
The fish and shrimp we had were overcooked and dry, and had a fishy taste, which points toward the lack of freshness in the products they use. We made the mistake of trying a dish with their, what they call cheese sauce, and it was disgusting. Cheese sauce should not have any hint of sweetness and yet their sauce had an odd sweet and savory flavor--a bit off-putting. The cost of the food does not match the quality of the service and the standard of food that is being prepared. My family and I have tried this place on 3 different occasions, attempting to give them the benefit of the doubt, and each time we left dissatisfied with the food. We will not be going back
2
I had dinner at the Century Square outlet on 24/12/2013 with my wife. We ordered mushroom soup,mussels,salmon(main) and prawn/fish meal. With 2 drinks. My wife soup came fast. Drinks came after 10mins. And its not busy. I waited for my mussels. I ask one of the servers. She check. And the screwed up started. My salmon came and still no mussels. They took it back. My wife mains came and thn the mussels. While I'm enjoying the mussels,out came my salmon for the 2nd time. By the time I finish my mussels; my mains turn cold. I always hv lunch or dinner at MFM. My fav are still the ones at City Square and Plaza Singapura. The servers are attentive. Please give your staffs the correct training they need before they work. I'm from FnB background and I'm ashamed if the standards; even for a fastfood,are not met. Thank you

The Manhattan Fish Market at Thomson Road United Square was disappointing. The clam chowder was pretty much tasteless, the mussels in a garlic sauce was OK but the bread - photographed in the menu to suggest toasted garlic bread was plain. The house salad was ordinary but included some lettuce leaves that looked suspicious. The most disappointing thing was the dory batter - it used to be a crisp light delight but last night it was more like a crumbed cover. The dory was tasteless. My partner's cheery snapper was better. The salad on my plate was daubed with a sweet minty mess. Partner was spared that. I'm crossing Manhattan off my list
3
Service could be better, but then they are rather short of staff. Food wise is just average and seafood platter portion seems a tad small.
5
I especially like the Mediterranean Baked fish. They serve this with rice soaked in a special sauce with a distinct fantastic taste. This is about the only this I order whenever I visit this restaurant. I recommend this to my friends.
4
We've eaten there on a number of occasions. food is great especially the house speciality of flaming ur food
1
Visited Bugis+'s outlet on 17/11/13.I'm so careless never checked my deal as I get cheated.I have brought 2 Groupon deal vouchers, one is $11.95 come w 1Fish n Chips Dory Lite+Fish n Chips Regular.Another voucher is $24.95 come w 1 Fish n Chips Dory Lite+1 Fish n Chips Regular+2 Soup of the day+2 Mocktail+1 Fried Country Mushroom.But I was being served less of 1 Fish n Chips Regular

I ate at The Manhattan Fish Market (in the Central Shopping Centre - Clarke Quay MRT) twice because it was close to where I was staying, the food was nice with generous portions and it was reasonably priced.I found the restaurant after eliminating some other restaurants within the complex. The first night I visited (Saturday about 8pm) there was a queue but it moved fairly quickly (about 15-20 mins). They happily accommodated me even though I was a solo diner.A meal of seafood entre, grilled Dory on a bed of herb garlic rice with vegetables, a drink and tea was a little over Sing$20.00Another night I had clam chowder, Manhattan fish, chips, sauce and salad, dessert, tea and soft drink this was about Sing$30.00I do agree with a previous reviewer about the back of the restaurant being more noisy, which it is, but I asked to the seated near the back of the restaurant on both occasions as the view across Clarke Quay is more interesting than looking at someone elses meal. I enjoyed both my meals and felt they were good value. The service was a bit hit and miss, but the staff polite.My one comment would be that the tables could be slightly larger
4
It was a second night Iwas craving for sea food but particularly, looking for Fish & Chips. We decided to visit the location at Junction 8. We reached at around 8 PM and there was a line. However, it moved fairly quickly and within 15/20 mins we were seated in the back. We ordered - yes you guessed it- Fish & Chips. There was a special with soup and ice Tea for Sing $ 5.90 which we all availed. The soup of the Day turned out to be Tomato, which we all agreed was delish ! I was hoping the Ice Tea had free Refills but unfortunately no. The main dish was very good with the fish being Dory. They give you a choice of either Dori or Snapper but we stuck with the Dori. They put a side of good tarter sauce and some salad splashed with some vinegar along with the Fish & Chips.Service was efficient though sitting in the back we had to hear a lot of noise of cutlery being sorted out and kitchen door opening.Other than that noise level, it was an enjoyable experience

ok.....so here goes the true feedback about this great restaurant.1. Food - Mind blowing and full of flavor. Cant find better fish and variety of cooking in the town.2. Resturant - Quite busy and crowded but you wont mind as the food covers up for every other short coming.3. Prices - Best value of money in the town. Decent portions, amazing flavors as compared to other similar restaurants trying to sell bland sea food. They can certainly not match with Manhattan.4. Must try - Baked Mediterranean fish, Spicy poached fish, aglio olio pastas with chicken breast, sea food platters for 2 -4 people. all the drinks are amazing too.In all if you want sea food and you want flavors too this is the place to go
3
Came here for dinner on the 8th July at Junction 8 outlet. Was shown to my cramped table by a young male trainee... Requested to change table and was refused cos I was told the crowd will start soon... Sounds ridiculous but I accepted it since it was dinner time. Asked for pepper since it was missing from my table and was given a the cold shoulder by the staff named "Siu Hui Hui" when i called out to her again, she handed me two bottles of salt instead. I had to go to another table and get it myself. FAILED!!!My seafood platter arrived and Ms Siu was the one to bring it to my table. I asked for 2 serving plates since there was none but she just walked away. The saving grace was from the restaurant manager Ms Mya Mya. The only one who understands the basic meaning of service. Would I come here and sine again??? NO WAY!!
3
Tried their fish and chips, fried calamaries, and some pasta before. Almost everything was bland, except the fries (and the lemon). If you're craving for seafood dish in a nice restaurant and have several extra dollars to spend, better find the nearest Fish & Co. and go there instead. (I am not in anyway affiliated with Fish & Co. It's really better
3
I was at the outlet in causeway point yesterday,13th May 2013 for a quick bite wif wifey. She had the promotional set while i had an Ala carte of grilled salmon. It was a horrible dish. Firstly the lady who took our order says tht the salmon will take 20mins to prepare. Thn she really tried to up sell my wife another drink with soup for an extra $2. Whn wifey's food arrive, in a matter of just a minute, my so called 20min salmon arrived. In the menu its stated tht the sauce was garlic herb but whn i ate the fish, the salmon tasted more like its drizzle with ketchup. I tried to get an explaination from the manager. Well he says tht garlic herb was on the fish and bbq sauce on the plate. Disappointment big time!! I always go to the one at City Square and they delivered. Please teach your staffs abt your products before sending it out to the guests!! Thank yo
1
its been more than the estimated time the server told us....the sexy hot fish dish....just doesnt worth the waiting.... :(
its really frustrating as my friend was pregnant and craving for a fish meal....and ended up with a :( face
3
I think their fish and chips are generally better than Fish & Co. Ask for more of their lemon herb sauce! Really great. But service at the restaurant is so-so only, depending on the outlets. Quite difficult to get their attention.
3
Been to the outlet at Plaza Sing. Went there when there is this 5 dollars deal for fish and chip, and dory fillet with rice set. Taste not bad and the portion is slightly smaller than regular ones.
4
The servings are always huge in places like this so if you're a weight weenie (chances are, your date is too), just order one platter and have a side to balance it off.
3
We had dinner one evening at the Star shopping center, not the one on Orchard. After waiting in line for 15 minutes, we were finally seated. My wife had a mushroom soup (dominant taste : flour) and mussels in a tomato sauce that were so so. She wanted baked fish but was told there was a 30 minute wait for these dishes, so opted for something else. I had their signature "flamed" fish and prawns that was good but not outstanding. Before being brought in, we saw several tables that nobody had cleaned up while people were waiting outside.Overall, ordinary meal and an ordinary price. I don't think we will go back
1
Went to the outlet at city square mall on 5th april. Was told to wait as they were running full (though i did notice 2-3 tables empty which the staff claimed were reserved) - fair enough. Me and my friends were let in after a 20 minute wait.Were shown a table and we placed our orders promptly at 2005hrs. Food didnt arrive until 2035 and when I called the waiter (mr wen chao), he acknowledged and replied it will be another 10 mins. When finally no food had arrived by 2055hrs, a very harrowed and hungry me, went to complain to the manager (since mr wen chao chose to ignore us completely and shoot some dumb blank stares at us).The manager (mr roy) listened to me and immediately attended to our order which arrived 10 minutes later at 2105 and GUESS WHAT- mr wen had taken the order wrongly and we got what we never ordered. Finally when food arrived, it was just average, costed about 60sgd for 2.OVERALL, POOR SERVICE, LONG WAITING, WRONGLY TOOK DOWN OUR ORDERS and the manager offered discount so we dont complain! We did politely turn down the discount, but my friend accepted at the managers insistence (given we spent about 3 hours for a friday dinner). NEVER AGAIN.
2
Went to plaza Singapura outlet with friend of mine. Upon entering, we waited for 5minute outside before someone notice us. Terrible. Furthermore when we are about to order, the staffs seemed to ignore us. We ordered set meal with baked Mediterranean fish with herb rice. Second time I've been to manhattan fish market, different outlet but very disappointed. Rice was under seasoned. Fish was dry, obviously overcooked and not fantastic. Although the sauce was flavour some. However the fish was a letdown. My friend ordered their scallop pasta. Pasta not al Dante. Probably a little overcooked. Scallops were fine, well seasoned. However pepper added was too much. Soup that came with it was better than the main course. What a letdown. Cream of mushroom was creamy, well seasoned. Bad service, plain food. Not gonna be back for more, definitely not this outlet
1
I was very disappointed with the quality of food that I was being served when I patronised the J Cube outlet on this day. I understand that I was a late guest, but I don't think the staff should have served me food that was waiting to be thrown into the garbage.My friend ordered the Small Flame, whereas I ordered the Dory Fish & Chips. Nonetheless, the waiting time was fairly well, we waited around 10-15 minutes for our food to arrive. Alas! When the food arrived, the fries were cold and the rice was terribly disappointing. I have always been a fan of their garlic herb rice, because the garlic herb rice is what makes the franchise stands out from its other contenders. But tonight's incident was unforgivable. I thought a small addition of the garlic herb sauce would make the rice softer, but no, it was still terrible. It was so dry and tasteless, it was like as if the kitchen staff just scraped the remnants of the rice at the bottom of the rice cooker and served it to us. Furthermore, when I asked their staff for additional garlic herb sauce, they said that the kitchen was already closed. And that was barely 2 minutes after i requested for the first one. We didn't want to make a huge fuss because every staff was singing happily during the closing time, so we just finished the fish and the prawns, thank God that wasn't cold too.I have made it a point to not patronise the outlet at JCube again, and I will definitely inform my contacts to not visit that outlet again. I hope the other outlets do not practise similar SOPs because this would definitely disappoint your loyal customers. It was a terrible experience for us

Tried the one at Changi City Point. We had their chicken, scallop, fish fingers dish with chips and rice. Not bad at all. Atmosphere not too good and they seem to be under orders to get the food to you as quick as possible in order to turn over the tables. Shame really because the food quite good. Always annoying is the 10% service charge (automatically added) plus 7% added to the bill, which makes it more expensive than it's worth. Yes, I know they can't do anything about the 7% tax but paying 10% tip when it's not worth it, is annoying
4
I usually go to the Whitesands outlet in Pasir Ris and at the most recent visit, I was greeted by the chef. Seemed a bit odd to have the chef (in a tall hat) explain the whole menu to me instead of the waiting staff - might have been a stunt but I never found out.Fish and chips were probably their best-selling item but I didn't want anything fried that day so instead, went with a grilled fish dish and was glad I did. Nicely grilled fish with a tangy hot ground sauce that all went well together with rice. Overall, the food was filling, tasty, and satisfying. Waiting staff were generally helpful but often looked like they were just standing around looking for something to do
5
MFM is one of my favourite seafood restaurants here! they have pretty good services, and fantastic food. I never get tired of their Fish and Chips. it really is a must try!!
4
The foods taste good but the price is too expensive,moreover got 10%service charge...
Recommended for fish lover coz is very unique=)
3
Mixed on this one as the Steamed Dory is excellent, but many of the other dishes I have tried have been mediocre.
5
Friendly service and menu was wide-ranging. Seafood served was fresh and delicious too. Highly recommended!
4
Fish well done, variety dishes I will go again there sure to try different dish this time....enjoy it all, cooool
5
Wonderful fish menu, good price, great service . It is right across the road from the Swissotel, easy to find well worth a visit.
2
There is really nothing special about the food. Basically is just like walking into fish n co and eating almost the same kind of food. Fries tends to be soften by the time the food came out.
2
Bad quality service, basic greasy food with more breadcrumb than seafood... We started with the mushroom soup that was tasteless. The Giant Fried Platter was left almost untouched as we slowly got disgusted. And the Mediterranean fish was barely acceptable - we only finished the rice
1
We ordered an appetiser of deep fried mushrooms, a small grill and a small fry. The mushrooms were tasteless, or rather, I could not taste the mushrooms underneath the big puffs of deep fried batter. The accompanying mustard honey sauce was overly sweet and did not enhance the taste of the appetiser. Both small fry and small grill were identical - both had prawns, deep-fried fish fillets, fries, garlic rice and broccoli and carrots - except that the small fry also contained squid rings. The prawns were slathered in a cloyingly sweet mayonnaise sauce which I found necessary to scrape aside, without which, the prawns would have been rendered inedible. Even then, I could not get rid of all the sauce and whatever remaining sauce that clung on the prawns made me feel sick after a while. The pieces of deep-fried fish were soft and mushy, and also slathered with the same cloying mayonnaise sauce. The broccoli and carrots that accompanied the dishes were very hard and bland. It appeared that the vegetables had, at best, been dipped only briefly in boiling water. The garlic rice in each dish was passable, but the fries were hard and dry. Also, I question why there was a need to serve two types of carbo in one dish. It was certainly a carbo over-load. The squid rings in the small grill were terribly salty and hard and shrunken. To top it off, service was patchy. After we were seated, no one brought us a menu and we could not even get any server's attention. In the end, we had to go take a menu from a neighbouring vacant table. We had been drawn to this eatery because of a book of coupons which was distributed into my mailbox. I was so disgusted by the quality of food there, after the meal, I left the entire book of remaining coupons on the table. I will definitely not be returning.
4
We love the flame prawns! The combination of the cheese & the prawns heated under fire is heavenly. The fried silver fish with coleslaw is a must for every visit. We usually order extras! Service is fantastic, everyone is so freindly & fantastic smiles every time I go there.
3
the grilled platter for 2 was a decent portion. the fish, prawns and calamari were yummy. the fries were soggy because they were placed below the fish. that was quite disappointing.
4
We have visited Changi City Point outlet last week and ordered for a Ocean platter. Tiger Prawns and Mussels are very tasty. Oyster is ok. Overall atmosphere is average.
4
Good food, reasonable rates, good service. Could do with a little more table space and less noisy other guests.
3
Not the best, not the worst, Service leaves something to be desired..
4
The food is good. The portions are big and filling. The food here is a little expensive.
4
Went to Manhattan Fish Market for lunch at Plaza Singapore. Though it is near to lunchtime, the restaurant was not crowded yet. It is to our benefit. The reception was attentive. We were seated in no time (as expected). We were immediately told of the soup and the special lunch for the day. We order our meals - snapper and Caesar salad. Both were tasty. Price is very reasonable. We will come back again.
3
The fish meat was huge and tasty I tell you. The salmon we ordered was awesomely sweet and we will be back. THe only drawback is that this cafe was filled with teenagers, which was rather noisy, otherwise it makes up a good place for fine dining. This could also be the reason why the service was so so.. We had ours at Marina Centre
1
I ate at the outlet in marina square today. Order the salmon dish with exceptions of having fries. It came with rice instead. I ask a service staff to change as it was not what i ordered. It came back with the same fish and cold fries. I call the manager to inform him that the dish was cold and he kindly say that he'll get it change. Instead they just cook back the same fish( over done) again. I ask for the bill and what surprised me was i still got charged for the food that was not eaten. So sad the service of F n B in Singapore is going downhill.
3
I had been to several outlet of The Manhattan Fish Market and I found that their standard a bit difer for differences branches. Some I feel quite nice, some I feel quite dry..may be it is over-fried.Overall, i feel their original fish and chips is the best
4
We visited the outlet at Pasir Ris after taking a leisurely bus trip on the No. 12 bus from our place on the East Coast. We had to wait for about 10 minutes as it was very busy (about 8.30 pm) but the wait was worth it. The food was really enjoyable and the service was quite good
2
Service was okay but everything else wasn't. The fish and other seafood didn't taste too fresh for a fish market concept restaurant.
3
The fish and chips are not so well done. The crush was nice and very crispy, but when you see the meat, its like not cook. Not really worth for the money but the staff there were great.
3
sort of oily. not much choices. but delicious fries n fish
4
I'm not a fish lover and I can't name any fishy dish. But I chance upon the restaurant and was forced to enter by friends and fell in love with any of the fishes they could serve me.
3
Its close competitor, Fish & Co., has friendly wait staff to serve customers but MFM has only so-so staff and its variety is more limited.
5
I go here once in 2 weeks - service great, fish tasty and the sides generous - every encouragement - a local Malaysian group with real professional touch - and price is very good. 5 star choice
3
Seems like Fish and Co, but not as tasty, and just as pricey. Not worth the trouble.
2
We went to the outlet at Clarke Quay (at the Central Mall)...food was, at first glance, good. What was offered on the menu looked tempting. In the end, we had the Dory fish and chips and the baked fish with herb rice... The fish and chips had fresh tasting batter and was crispy. However, the fish itself did not have the top grade taste. The baked fish with herb rice came with 2 mussels and lots of local chili - odd way of dressing up the item I thought. It was tasty but the chili was rather much - it blanked out the subtleties of what the dish had to offer.The service was so-so. Not very attentive even though the no. of staff far outnumbered the no. of customers that evening.But by far the biggest complaint was about the freshness of the food. As soon as we got back, both of us had stomach upset, mine more severe than my wife's. Even though no medication was required and it passed after one night, the event left a poor impression of the restaurant on us. Without scientific evidence, we can only say it is either the hygiene standards practised at this location or the freshness of the food.We are willing to give it another shot, but not in the short to medium term and certainly not at the location at Clarke Quay
4
This restaurant is in a mall just around the corner from the Mandarin Oriental. It has a bit of a fast food look, but be assured, the food and service are excellent. I think it may be the best place for lunch after a morning of mall shopping
5
I just had a dinner with my hubby tonight at Manhattan Fish Market (Bedok Point). I always ordered the We ordered Fish n Chips Cherry Snapper and it's always delicious. Less oil.If you're not hungry, you can order the 'Light' selection which is 2 pieces ($11.90) or order the dory (light) which only 1 piece ($8.90). Regular Cherry Snapper will be 3 pieces for $13.90.You also can try one of their best seller "Fried country mushrooms." It served with Cajun honey mustard." at $7.90.*They served ice water as well.Good service with delicious yummy food & value for $$.We love it! :
3
Service staff are very attentive and responsive to diners needs. The food is average.
4
I Stay spore but Miss my Home Town country food mostly, so i walk in en try This place, feel tasty en likes one of my country food. Yummy for the 11st time try.
4
I have always found the place to be very crowded. There would most definitely be a queue during peak hrs (12 pm-3 pm and 7pm-9:30pm). We were made to wait for nearly 20 mins before being ushered in. The ambience was average, the place was cramped and heavily crowded. The tables were arranged pretty close to one another, we had to squeeze and walk between the tables. The food was good. We ordered for Baked Dory in Garden Herbs, Manhattan Fish n Chips and Seafood Olio. The dory fish was excellent. The portion was perfect for one person. The dory fish was soft and well-marinated. I was slightly unhappy with the fish n chips. The fish portions were big alright, but was not tender and soft, as was expected. The fries were good and fried to perfection. The pasta was a total dissapointment. It was too soggy for my liking, taste was average.Service was not up to the mark, we had to keep asking the crew to refill our water glasses. Overall, I would give a 5/10.
3
my friends and i visited the outlet in iluma, with the groupon voucher for a giant fried platter for 2. the restaurant was 80% filled when we arrived at about 7pm. 15mins later and we probably would have to join a queue of diners waiting for tables. we were ushered to our table. the staff who sighted the groupon print-out my friend was holding, immediately took it and asked if we were using the voucher. we said "yes" and he disappeared with the voucher. not knowing what was going on, we were left sitting at our tables for the next 15-20mins. no one offered or served us ice water. nor did any other staff bother us. we waved the attention of a staff and asked what was going on. only then that we realised, oh... our order is being processed after the groupon voucher was taken. we ordered extra dishes as there were 4 of us... afraid that the platter for 2 was not sufficient. our salad came shortly after the platter and we happily ate. the BUTTER rice in the platter was absolutely divine! we loved it. the other stuff in the platter (fried mushrooms, calamari, prawns, fish) were just soso. the fish was good after the rice. we almost completed both dishes and our additional order of BARAMUNDI (fish) had yet to appear. guess they had forgotten about our order. the fish arrived a mere few minutes after we brought to the staff's attention of our missing dish. eating the baramundi was like having a stingray.... especially with the sambal sauce. overall, MFM's food is acceptable though the service at this outlet can be more attentive

Date: 20 Aug 11Time: 5.31pm to 8.02pmCashier ID: 10 Aiy PingHi, I would like to make a feedback/complaint on the service and food provided at Marina Sq Outlet, on the date of dining above.1) Me & my friend were not addressed politely upon arriving to the outlet, we were being put on hold at the main entrance for about 10mins (reason: the waiter mentioned he need to clear his table first, HOWEVER there were plentiful of empty tables for him to clear the queue at the entrance first before he should clear tables.)2) We waited from 5.30pm till 6.10pm for just 2 plates of Fish & Chips. (Moreover there were 2 tables of customers after us being served with their food earlier than us DESPITE our order getting through earlier.)3) When we call for bill at about 7pm, it only came to us after our 3rd call to the waiter and its 8pm by then. Its far too long for the wait, especially when there is a heavy queue out at entrance at that time.)4) Misc feedback such as: the attending of waiter/waitress were not prompt AT ALL. Calling for extra sauces, refilling water will put us to wait at least for 15 mins and we have to remind the FORGETFUL staff more than once for all our requests.Lastly, it meant for a little celebration with my friend at MS Outlet. In the end, due to all the negligence, forgetfulness, poor service of the staff, we had an unpleasant dinner. We will definitely not return, and also will inform all our friends and family on our bad experience with MFM. Furthermore, we would like to hear the reply/response from the management in terms of the poor service from Marina Outlet before we decide if we should follow up this issue with various parties such as HungryGoWhere.com, before the entire MFM is being affected by just a single/few parties whom isn't interested in putting extra effort in excellent customer service

Went to the branch at The Central. The service crew all have a bad attitude. Yeah, I am using groupon but it's not free. I got to pay for it.the staff was really rude n no thank you no smile. A lady sitting next to my table was also complaining to her hubby. Be prepare for badService.

If you're planning on using your Groupon voucher at The White Sands outlet... Beware !First they'll screen you at the entrance, then they'll treat you like a 3rd class client !I'll never eat at this restaurant or use a Groupon Deal again !Lousy Service .... Bad experience

ordered 3 cherry snapper using groupon at white sand manhattan fish. we understand that it does not come with drinks n soup. my 2 other friends order seafood mariana and seafood platter for 1 and was told by the waiter that these 2 come with drinks n soup. However when the bill came, i was charge S$11 for the 2 drinks n soup. when i checked with the supervisor, he told me that since i made use of 3 groupon voucher, i am not entitle to have free drinks n soup for the seafood mariana n seafood platter for 1. So,.... this is clearly the fault of the staff at manhattan fish. I do not want to create a scene since my friends are there so i paid the bill as it is. all i got from teh supervisor is sorry, my staff made a mistake. How unprofessional ! He should have waive the charges for the 2 soup n drinks since this is no fault of the customers. on top of that, i really do not understand wht the supervisor need to ask customer in the queue " are u using groupon ?" can't he wait till the customer are seated b4 even asking. are u telling the customers that if u are using groupon, u will be seated in a different part of the restaurant or are we being considered as a 2nd class customer ! Staff should be trained properly when they have promotion and not to charge customer for the staff mistake for something the customer can do without ! An UNHAPPY meal

I went to City Square just to hang around yesterday. I tried here coz its halal. Had the cajun salmon and its cook perfectly. The smoothie could be better. Service was a bit lapse. But one service lady did well enough to leave them a bit of gratuity. Her name is Rohila if i'm not wrong

Had the cajun salmon. Change the garlic herb rice to fries but still came with rice. Got it change. Thanx to a very attentive server, Rohila i think. Smoothie very normal but good. Literally finish the meal. Service could be better if staffs got enough training. Outlet at City Squar

LOVE their fish.. affordable.. try the twin sharing...

somewhat like Fish & Co., in terms of pricing, taste and service.

OK for lunch or casual dining, fragrant butter rice. Advice to order a mixture of fried and grilled/wet dishes, if its all fried dish, it can be pretty dry & jia-lat. The one at Central (opposite Clarke Quay) nicer ambience and scenery during day time.

Not Bad but fish N Co still better hehe-p

Once you've tried Fish & Co, this cannot make it :(

Garlic butter mussels, chef's clam chowder and Manhatten seafood platter for two - - A mouth-watering sea harvest treat for everyone, deliciously yummy. I don't fancy fish and chips, afterall there are copycats all around churning out similar dish, nothing fantastic at all.

Bad fish, bad fries, blah menu

The seafood platters are really nice and can be shared. The American decor entertained this American.

A friend recommended I try their set lunch which was quite good and reasonable. I had a meal with a friend at Central once, got a $5 voucher and decided to visit them again and try their set lunch this time.When I arrived, I asked a waiter (seems to be the one in charge) if I could use it for the set lunch and he said "sure!". He gave me a menu as I sat and noticed that there is no set lunch menu. Looking at the flyers on the table and found one with a $9.90 promotion on top, the same price as their set lunch promotion. Noticing that there is a fish and chips meal and baked fish, I even enquired about the portion and was assured both are about the same. After ordering the baked fish, I waited and enquired about my soup. That's when the same waiter came to me and said that was not a set meal. Why didn't he tell me when he knew I had asked about their set meal? After I finished my meal, I went to pay and received another shock. The price is $17.50! The flyer did not state the price but made it appear that the price is the same for both dishes unless you scrutinise carefully (no price actually for the baked fish!).I was really upset that they have a promotion when it appears they had no intention of promoting. Since the promotion menu is not for the set meal, there is then no set meal menu on the table. They have another so called 20% promotion which is in the form of more vouchers and offered me $4 worth! This must be a joke right to get me to come back again and get conned? I was so angry that I tore the vouchers right in front of the staff and their customers as a waitress tried to explain its "benefits" and told them that I am never coming back again.It may seems like it is my fault that I did not scrutinise the menu and prices carefully but honestly, I can't remember any restaurant in Singapore with such a "devious" marketing scheme to catch customers unaware. The cafes or restaurants will always have a set meal promotion flyer or menu especially when it is marketed quite prominently. There are so many restaurants in Singapore and such practices will certainly cause their customers to get angry and not come again. And I have scolded my friend who recommended me and am telling my other friends of my bad experience! And the service is really terrible. They don't even offer any water and I had to asked for it halfway during my meal before they served me.My take to all service organisations: If you have a promotion, then you need to make sure everyone knows about it and gets to enjoy it. If your strategy is to entice people to come with some promotions but then use gimmicks to get them purchase something else, it would hurt you in the long run. By all means, try upselling but the customers must be allowed to decide without pressure. Only then the promotions will entice customers to come back again

just average.

Apparently better, (and cheaper) than Fish & Co.
Hot on the list is their Seafood Platter for Two, but I still prefer Fish & Co.'s.
And the queue? Interminable.
3
A knock off Fish & Co...in all honesty can't quite tell the difference, a cheaper alternative in fact.

Nothing to shout about . Though Musscles are worth a try

Standard pretty much matches to the more well-known Fish&Co.
