It's quite a nice place for couple to chill out in the morning....place seems to be frequent by local celebrities.. ; ) maybe after this post no more see them Liao..
5
Lovely environment next to the stables. Service was fantastic!!! They noticed that Husband and myself were sharing a burger and asked if we would like it cut into half. Appreciate the attention to details! Food is nice.
4
Never expect to have a cafe that is away from the busy city. Nice and quiet ambience to have lunch and even drinks with a group of friends. No aircon though but there are sufficient fans in the cafe. Will visit again.
5
Visit before 10am for a table near the stable. Food is as cafe standard . service crew is good. No major issues.
Reception is excellent , allocate window seats for us
5
Good ambiance. Good food. Friendly staff. Ample parking. It was a quiet place with fresh air in nature.
3
Need to be louder when repeating order.
The server was too soft, couldn't hear her and it got double order
3
Food was not good and slow. Atmosphere was alright but the service was slow as well. Everything was below average
5
This lovely cafe serves food till 3pm. It's one of those places where you want to get away from the city and enjoy the breeze. The horse stables are at the back, so do expect the nature odor from the horses. But the odor is not that bad, you just have to get use to it. Service is excellent and the food is above average.
4
The cafe is in an old colonial house, which automatically makes it very quaint and cosy. The windows were wide open, giving us a good view of horses trotting pass, which was a nice touch since it's not something you get to experience at most eateries.I ordered the Diavolo "Under A Brick" Chicken, which was adequately seasoned with spices and surprisingly not too dry (since a lot of chicken dishes tend to be dry). But the star of the dish was the creamy polenta!Just a heads up if you have a sensitive nose: you can kinda smell the horses as they walk past HAHAHA but it wasn't too pungent for me
4
It was a busy period - Sunday lunch but despite a bit of a wait at the door to confirm our reservation and for our food to be served, the team performed well together and it was evident that they work well together. Food was served together and was excellent. My poached eggs were nicely done and crab melt was made with a nice balance between cheese and crab. Reservations absolutely necessary if you are going during Sat lunch, Sat dinner and Sun lunch despite their out of way location.
3
Can get really packed, so be prepared to wait even if you have made reservation. Main restaurant can be noisy.
4
Visited Riders Cafe on a rainy day hence no able to get close up with the horses. Love the ambiance and also the rosti with scrambled egg and mushroom :)
4
Nothing to complain.
Food was just as good as before.
Service was as pleasant as before.
It was a damp night so it was more cooling.
From starters to dessert to all else, it was pleasurable again.
Thanks to all at Riders Cafe.
4
Food was ok and the choclate cake was delicious. Nice quiet place for dinner. The drive in was a bit far though.
4
very nice environment amidst the swaying green trees and lazing horses. food is good for its price. service is excellent.
5
nice place i ordered brunch and the food was gd, service also good. will definitely go again for brunch
4
it was good! The service was on point, the waiter could have served water first before taking our orders
4
It is my third visit to Rider's and as usual, I loved it the place and the overall vibes. It was full house that day yet service was not compromised. However, we did have a bit of an episode with the mustard though. The first dish we requested came in streaky and the consistency was more watery than usual. We ordered the steak, fish and chips, beef burger and seafood linguine. Sadly the first two dishes did not live up to expectations. Steak was a little thin and the fish was a stale. The ladies enjoyed the burger and the linguine. Expect a hearty serving. If you are lucky, you'd be able to catch a glimpse of the horse — the reason why my companion loves this place. And on both our visits here we bumped into two cats, a white + grey and a fat callie. Don't be shy and play with them! They are really friendly and they don't bite
4
Wanted a quiet peaceful “countryside” style restaurant to celebrate Christmas Eve and this is it. I knew it would totally fit my requirements cos I have been here before once. Glad to be back again for Christmas. U could see horses lazing in their stables n smell them but it’s all about getting close to nature. Great food n great ambience. Great service too. Not at all crowded. Recommended for those who love peace
3
I visited a few times when I was in Singapore in 2012-2013. loved the environment and the great (if not slightly pricey) food.Riders is better known for their breakfasts, but this is only served before 11am daily.If you miss the breakfast, you have to order from the main menu. The menus is however highly uninteresting and about 10-20% higher than other cafes of this calibre. Furthermore, portions are rather small. The only think I would recommend would be the "Death by chocolate cake", still delicious and rich as ever
4
We went for dinner last Sunday and tried the pan fried snapper and fish and chips. Fish was good but there was too much peas.
5
Visited for Sunday breakfast, my wife and I are regulars. Lovely ambience and food is very fresh and tasty - not your usual bacon and eggs menu which is refreshing. Lovely service by staff and great to see horses and birds in nature
3
Food good, queue insane so best to make reservation. Service was slow but staff pleasant and cheerful.
5
The customer services is good and staff are attentive and helpful. The food is good and the environment is comfy.
5
Quite place for dinner and chat.
Staff were very pleasant and attentive.
Quality of food was excellent.
5
Its saturday, you wake up late. too late for breakfast and too easy for lunch. What you need is a good satisfying brunch.An easy ambience away from the city crowds, somewhere in the open, a riding club perhaps? Lush green grounds, stables and even the horses neighing away sonorously in their stalls. This then is the view, the scenic effect that along with the sumptuous brunch menu makes for an idyllic noon/afternoon spent in the lap of nature.Good stomach filling meals, lumpy but juicy hamburgers and mouth watering scambled eggs, and eggs made anyways/all ways. Yummy. beer is good, wine relaxing but their cocktails area serious no-no. bloody mary is tomato juice personified, best avoided. Stick to beer and you cannot go wrong
3
There's only a handful of places where you can dine among the greenery and enjoy its serenity in Singapore; Riders Cafe is one such venue and it remains as one of my favourites! Despite the occasional whiffs of you-know-what from the stables, dining with the horses within sight is still a remarkable experience. ;
4
if you would like a new environment for dining, not the usual restaurant or cafe, try this. fresh air with the smell of hay (and horse)- a tad like the zoo. food is decent, flavourful, but menu is a little limited. weekend lunchtime was bustling when i was there, make reservations if you want to guarantee a spot.
4
Saw from the other reviews that this place is horrible on weekends, so we decided to come on a weekday for breakfast.The service was jiffy since there weren't many patrons - we took a table overlooking the stables and the fields where the horses were going about their morning routine.Ordered the below items:- The Usual (eggs, sausage, toast) - $18.00- Ricotta Pancakes - $14.00- Iced Chocolate - $5.00- Long Black - $4.00The Usual was pretty OK - not too huge a serving at a decent price.The pancakes - oh the syrup was so thick my partner felt sick after having just one from the stack (of 3?).The long black was decent as well and so was the iced chocolate.All in all, this location is worth a visit, especially if you have kids (they have pony rides on weekends iirc). The surroundings are quiet and peaceful especially on a weekday morning (can't say the same for weekends!). Food is decent for its price only though
5
Set amidst lush greenery and next to the Bukit Timah Saddle Club, this cafe offers a unique dining experience.The food is good, service staff attentive and ambience lovely. At certain times of the day, you can see riders on their horses go by or in the stables.The cafe can get very crowded on weekends and service may be a little slow then. Weekdays are less crowded and offers diners a tranquil place to chill in or enjoy a romantic meal
4
the ambience was nice but warm. Food took quite some time to come out but portion was generous and good!
4
Celebrated my friend’s hen day here! Nice ambience and environment. We used the entertainer app here and we got 4 mains for the price of 2. Super worth it!
3
The burger was not bad, but the atmosphere of the place wasn’t very good as I got a lot of insect bites..
5
Brought my baby there, to dine and visit the horses in the stable next. door. Food was delicious as usual and staff vry accomodating :)
3
Cafe and food is great, staff are attentive. Let down by long waiting time for food - we waited for 30 mins and I noticed that there were several diners waiting for their food.
4
The food was great! Love the sceneries and the nice cosy ambience. A great place to relax on my days off!
5
My family has been going to Riders Cafe for years for lunches and brunches and have not been disappointed so far. The food is always delicious, the service always friendly (sometimes the staff can be a little green but they try their best), and the ambience is wonderful. It's not air-conditioned and sitting near the balcony can be a little warm, but the plus side is you get to see horses being groomed and walked. You can always choose the inside seating if you want the full benefit of the fans. It can get pretty crowded, so book in advance
2
We ordered and waited for over an hour before we were told our food hadnâ€™t even been put in yet because there was a big party. Nobody told us they were delayed but this is far too Long to wait for lunch. They did comp our drinks, but this was horrible service.
3
Location unique over looking a horse riding school in what seems to be a converted two story stables. Surroundings are lush and green.Went for Sunday breakfast with two kids and got one of the last unreserved tables - next time, will reserve in advance to get a table overlooking the training paddock.In the end the food was good but only after it being sent back twice...Potato chats (called potato hash but were just small cut up pieces - no hash at all about it) were cold when they came out - like they had either been poorly re-heated or been sitting in th ekitchen for 10 minutes before plate had been bought out...These were taken off to be re-heated, so started eating eggs benedict and it too was stone cold and eggs solid - that went back also. Another one came out very quickly so I presume they gave me someone else's order. Manager advised it was busy and a lot of orders all at once... still, they should not compromise on quality.Food was good in the end, and the ambience and surroundings so good that I will give it another go in the hope that they can get better, as the location deserves it. Would be a great place early morning before the crowds arrive or mid afternoon on a rainy day with a book
3
Situated right next to the Bukit Timah Saddle club, its location makes it an ideal location for a weekend brunch. I went there with a friend for brunch. I ordered a smoked salmon & sweet corn hash. My friend ordered a Blackstone benedict. Even though the poached eggs were wonderfully done, that was the best part of the meal. Both the salmon and bacon were so salty that it was hard to swallow! Prices are reasonable but I will surely not visit the place again
4
Great place as always - just need to remember that the Entertainer app can only be used after 11am as it’s valid only for mains and not breakfasts.
5
My all time favorite brunch place - it was not too hot, good service and great food. The burnt banana french toast was good.
5
Love the atmosphere, food is delicious, with reasonable price and good service, went before n will visit again! Recommend brunch
4
a misunderstanding with the waiter. i asked for 2 egg well done, sunny side up. was served 2 eggs well done and turned over
3
Standard of food was very average. Nothing special. Asked for a window seat but was given a table right in the middle of the restaurant.
4
A new bottle of water was replenished despite our food finished and plates cleared. Food was good portion and my friend (who is first time at Riders Cafe) had wanted to tip. Maybe a mint sweet upon our bill settlement would refresh our breathe! Thanks.
5
We went for a brunch, 4 people. Got our dishes at the same time. The staff very efficient
The food is good, not too expensive.
5
Atmosphere is perfect and just few of left in SG........ like it and already went many times .......and my friends also love this place!
2
I have gone to Riders Cafe numerous times. Great setting set amongst greenery and horses but unfortunately today the service was poor. Breakfasts delivered to the table 10 minutes apart after asking, coffees not the usual high standard. Food average as mine was cold as had to wait for the others yo be served. Worth a visit but watch the poor service
5
It was a pleasant 4th visit at Riders Cafe. I was late this round (about 10 to 15 minutes), but was still dealt with reasonable temperament by the serving crew. The ambiance and food were consistent and great, alongside their diligent and thoughtful service. They deserve every success with a dedicated team
5
The ambience of environment was lovely, making our evening relax, chatting over food. The steak and red snapper were excellent.
4
Been meaning to eat at Riders Cafe for the longest time. No regrets as food was good. Clearly inaccessible by public transport so recommended to drive in.
Choice is slightly limited
2
Ordered their fried chicken BLT and kid's fried chicken goujons. Both were overcooked. For the price I paid, I expected better.
5
We enjoyed the delicious food priced reasonably, as well as the views of the stables-- horses! I like the open air concept which makes you feel that you are really one with nature :)
2
Service was gd and attentive. However, The cafe was extremely warm (no air-con) and food was very average. Not a gd place to bring babies who couldn't sleep in the heat
4
Food was a huge portions and service crew was awesome, they check with every table to Ensure everything was ok. But the atmosphere was a bit hot as it does not have aircondition. But overall it's good
4
Great: Relaxing atmosphere surrounded by a lot of green. Great place to have a brunch somewhere "different" from the city side. Food was decent enough for me too.Downside : You need a car or cab to get there, and it's not easy to get a cab back (perhaps there aren't so many cabs around there).
2
We have been to Rider's cafe many times and it is great for breakfast (starts at 8am and ends at 11am). The food is quite good and portions are quite decent for the price. Coffee is pretty good too! However wait time for food can be long!! ( 25 - 35 mins) so I won't recommend it if you are in a hurry. I am not sure if the ambience and "ok" food is worth the hassle. Another "con" is that it is a bit out of the way... Otherwise it is a good place to relax and enjoy the food.
3
Not sure if it was due to the fact that we did not try the brunch, but we found the mains only average. Had the Seabass and Special - Bacon wrapped chicken. Waited more than 30 mins for our food after placing order but food came barely warm. Also tried the highly raved Death by Chocolate cake. Felt that it was overrated and just an average chocolate cake drenched with chocolate sauce and ice cream.Pretty expensive and ulu. No idea how people visit this cafe without a car. Service was the only plus point as the atmosphere was pretty noisy due to a big group bday celebration
3
I've always enjoyed my meals in Rider's as I've found their food quality and standard to be consistent the times that I've visited. However my visit last Sat was a little disappointing as our food was served almost cold versus piping hot. It gave the impression that the food was left out for a while before being served. I'm taking this time as a one-off due to shortage of manpower
4
Had a good Saturday brunch. My request for balcony sit was granted. Thank you for making my Saturday well spent after a stressful week
5
The place was full when we arrived, around 130pm on a Saturday but thankfully we made an advanced booking via the Chope app. The occasional sightings of horses and equestrians definitely makes this an interesting brunch experience!
5
Cafe staff had very good I initiative and was able to cater to our requests. Very pilot staff as well
4
Overall quite a lovely place to have brunch. Great for families as well as couples. But service could improve.
5
Ambience was great, having a casual, laid-back meal in the middle of lush greenery and away from the busy streets of Singapore was definitely a welcome change. Service was excellent, servers were very friendly and helpful, and the food was not bad as well.
5
Tucked away from the hustle bustle of the city, this quaint restaurant not only has a great ambiance, but also serves delicious food. Def a must-visit!
4
Good chillax place with horses trotting around for viewing. Brought my kids for the pony ride. Enjoyed themselves
4
We made a reservation with Chope and arrived 45 mins early. The hostess took note of our arrival, assured us that she would give us a call when our table was ready and invited us to check out the pony ride next door. About 15 minutes later, we received a call that our table was ready. We were given a table that overlooked the field, much to our delight. Our server gave us good recommendations re: the food, and the food arrived soon thereafter. Alas, the food was so so, usual brunch and lunch food without anything very special. Would return for the location, but not necessarily the food (given that I live all the way in the east!).
4
Restaurant is not air-conditioned, but we went on a weekday evening, so it wasn't too warm. If you choose the outdoor seats, you may catch the horses trotting in and out of their stables if you're lucky! The food was ok, but not fantastic enough to warrant the journey to such a secluded location. The chocolate cake was fantastic though, but would definitely need to be shared amongst 2-3 people.
4
It was a beautiful morning and perfect for a lovely breakfast with our guests. The waiter gave us a nice corner table where we had a great view of the stables and the horses which were out exercising, bathing and being groomed. The horses were well looked-after and were beautiful and sleek. We enjoyed looking at them while having breakfast. My pancakes were really good. Soft and tasted great. My guests had eggs and potato hash and salmon breakfast and they declared they were all delicious!
4
Loved the riders burgers. Paid a little more to change the regular fries to truffle ones! Quite a treat.
The mushroom sauce top up was good to have, but the burger was already pretty good without it!
3
Food is not bad, service is gd, cannot view the horses from 1100 to 1530hrs. Need to plan ard the timing
5
Always like to come here even if alone! Is really a nice place for meals or just a cup of coffee! Surrounded by greens and nature with horses too. Good food and nice coffee! Lotsa parking!
4
One of the few places I return to time and again and I'm never disappointed. Will definitely return again
2
Wait around 1 hour for food to arrive. Other who came late got their food first.
Drink was finish before food served.
4
Lovely spot which we fell in love with and so we had our solemnisation done here.
Seth and team were v accommodating and helpful!
For meals, go for their brunches. Lovely food especially the crab omelette!
5
My husband brought me here for breakfast for our second year anniversary. If you love horses and also wide open spaces with lush greenery this is the place for you. The service is good the location is beautiful and the breakfast is awesome. Good to go on a weekday morning. Barely any crowd. Don't forget to make a reservation just in case
4
Good food! great options for breakfast. Nice place for a weekend meal! ambiance is nice. They service was good too. They swapped pork bacon with salmon due to our dietary restriction. The death by chocolate had great reviews so I had to try it. However, I was kinda disappointed. It was a bit too dry for me
5
A really great place for a weekend brunch session with friends or family. I ordered the smoked salmon and corn hash. All was good except for the avocado/guacamole, the colour was a little off - almost looked like it was left out in the open for a tad too long, to give it context it was like a dirty green colour. Else, everything was great.
4
I have visited on different occasions over the years. Best timings ive found is Weekend Morning (can see horses come out from the stables next door sometimes) or Weekday Nights (candlelight)Request for the balcony seats. They are more airyFood has been consistent over the years. The house burger is one of my classic favourites! Goes well with the fries! Also the pan seared/ grilled fish is good! You can hardly find such beautiful surroundings in Singapore so it's worth to go.Only 2 cons are: inaccessible by public transport. You have to drive /grab/uber. The other is the stairs, so it's not wheelchair friendly.Parking is fre
5
Awesome ambience overlooking the horse stables nearby.
Food was excellent and service was top notch as well (friendly servers).
5
Riders cafe was a nice & cosy place for brunch. It would be better if can improve on the outdoor seating area. Sun get to shine in.
5
It was charming, it had the right background music at the right wuiet level where you can hear each other talk, the right ambience and out of the busling city. Perfect 1. anniversary for us. Thank you!
4
We came on a Sat evening for late dinner. Staff was attentive and courteous. Food was tasty. Point to note that this place is not airconditioned so need to wear comfortable clothing. Will recommend the Death by Chocalate Cake for dessert.
5
Food standard still maintain & that's explain the crowd every wkend for brunch. Staffs also very helpful.
5
Visited this cafe with girlfriends and my baby boy. Service was excellent. Food (salmon and corn breakfast) was delicious. Coffee was great. It was raining during our visit, so the cafe was cool. The outlook over the horse stables, and lots of trees, was calming, and a lovely retreat from the hustle and bustle of Singapore
5
I needed to clarify and change some of my booking details via the CHOPE app, called in and the staff was willing to help amend booking details. Dinning experience was fantastic. Staff there were super friendly and asked how the food was for us. Will definately come back to visit again.
4
Breakfast pretty good, we had "the usual : bacon not destroyed & edible for a change (unlike most Singaporean chefs :) )Poached eggs done perfect, wifes scrambled a little wet and maybe too much milk or cream (or whatever filler they used). Mushrooms nice and assorted, grilled tomato perfect. Nice environment although if you dont want to be swamped with annoying babies go early! Coffee o
5
Brought my family to try Riders Cafe and they were pleased with the experience! Only that it was a sunny and humid afternoon and only if there air conditioning, we would've stayed longer! Disappointed that scotch egg is only served on weekends! Nonetheless it was a pleasant experience (
1
We were there on a weekday so it was not crowded. Only the seats at veranda were occupied. We requested for the veranda in our booking but was told request could not be met. We are actually fine with that had the waitress who came to us conveyed it more professionally. Even when we were placing our orders, she didnt come across as a friendly person. Instead, answers to our queries were short and sharp. It was not a very pleasant start. Luckily the rest of the serving crew, 1 other waiter and 1 other waitress on duty were fine. Else I would have given service a poor rating and not average for service. But when a caucasian couple came in later, and seated close to us, there is a drastic change in the manners of this particular waitress. I was left feeling disgusted. Yes we are locals. A point to add was this waitress was fidgeting with her hairband nonstop, taking it out and putting it back on her head, quite a few times we were there. Hygiene and professional wise, I do not think that should be allowed.So if Riders Cafe would love to serve a particular group of customers, please do state so. No one would enjoy having a morning spoilt from feeling being discriminated. It was a shame as the food was nice, not forgetting the surroundings.
4
restaurant a little busy.. food was nice.. ambience was nice.. has a bit of stench but it was bearable..
4
They continue to strive and provide good service despite how busy they can be over weekends. Pleasant staff. Please KEEP IT UP!!!! Well done Team @Riders Cafe! 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
5
Been here more than 5x. Always made reservation before coming as this place is small. The food is sooooo tasty and service crew so awesome!!!
3
Ok but barely.
Not particularly exciting menu, decently cooked.
Friendly but slightly rigid staff.
...
4
Been visiting Riders cafe countless time. Love the ambiance and brunch. Good for families and couples.
4
Nice food but not air conditioned. Too stuffy and hot at 12pm. Food took very long to be served too.
5
Away from bustling city and retreat into riders cafe to enjoy nature of trees and horses. With good food and nice coffee, it's an excellent option.
4
Riders cafe may be a wee bit hard to get to (just take a taxi in if you don't drive ) But once you're there you won't think you're in Singapore due to the colonial house setting and horses in sight Food was delicious and typical restaurant pricing but with the entertainer app it's more value for money
2
Had a dinner celebration for my wife. Starters was ok. We had to reject 3 main course out of 4. Steak was overcook to well done when requested for medium, pork chop way too salty and dry, got it replaced by pasta and rissotto overcooked with scallops over salted replaced too.Spend $300+ (aft service recovery discount) for 3 starter, 4 mains, 1 dessert and 2 bottles of wine. Service staff is attentive. Ambiance is good. Maybe its the travelling that made expectations higher than usual
4
The best thing about Riders is its namesake location at the Riding Club. There is green all around and the chance to watch horses giving little children rides and to see others in their stables is lovely. Thankfully the food is pretty good too! Brunch offers choices for everyone. We always get a bit warm as there's only fans because the sides are open to outside, so no aircon. An enjoyable spot for brunch.
4
Quality of food and service is good. Variety of brunch menu is limited. But the restaurant setting is nice.
5
I enjoyed my brunch with my Boyfriend at Rider's cafe. We had the rider's burger and scrambled eggs on rosti with the death by chocolate cake and man, they were great!
4
Had breakfast with family and kids... It's a blessing. Kids love to watch those horses bathing and having meals too
3
I did not take photo for the dinner I had with my Husband last night. We both ordered riders burger with fries as side dish. Burger was deliciously, just the fries, for me, it's not even as tasty as the one at McDonald, it's hard and thin. The mayo source was way too sour. We ordered 2 glasses of red wine, they delivered 2 chilled reds, we asked for a change to normal temperature, reds are not supposed to be chilled. My Husband finished the meal first and the staff immediately came to take plate away and asked if we wanna order dessert while I was still half way eating my dinner, I feel this is little bit pushy and no polite. The burger (I ordered medium well with extra mushrooms top up) was really delicious, just some other little things I really the restaurant and their staff have rooms to improve and be trained better. Personal comments only.
4
The staff was really friendly there, despite being not able to locate my reservation I was given a seat almost immediately and when the reservation was found the staff also came back and informed me again. The food and coffee was also good there however a downside was that there was no fries on the date of our visit and hence all sides will fries had to be changed to mash or salad. We ordered 2 dishes the pork chop and the steak fries and both were good
5
I have been to Riders Cafe twice in the last month for breakfast. The breakfast are very good and the coffee excellent. On both occasions the coffee has been on a par with what you would get in Melbourne. It us in a nature setting with horses around - really nice chilled setting for breakfast on a nice day. You do need to make a reservation or you will wait but good opportunity to take a walk and they will call you. Enjoy
2
food looks better than it taste, so that was kinda disappointing.Crew unorganized and had trouble allocating table because there were over booked. we had to wait for 10 mins depsite being on time for our reservation. And had to ask twice if our table is ready
4
Went to Bukit Timah Saddle Club to take a look at the area. Nice huge area to walk around as well as have a meal. As we were there around tea time, we ordered a drink... the fresh lime cooler seems to be a hot favourite on a hot day. The Boston iced tea was pretty good too. Thought of having early dinner but was not able to order any dinner at 5.30pm, so we gave it a miss. Nice place with view of greenery ..
4
I enjoyed my experience at Riders! First off, I called to tell them I was going to be late, and they held the table for me. Food there were not pricey and tasted good. The coffee was to my liking. On the website it says they may take the table back in light of high volume. Thankfully that didn't happen and we sat by the window, enjoying the breeze and rain while sipping on coffee.Their coolers were nice and I absolutely love the fragrance of their scornes.I love it that it was away from the hustle and bustle, and there are a lot of families there. If you are not a fan of noisy cafes with families and kids, you might want to avoid that place on a Sunday morning.
3
We love it here. You're amongst a lovely Riding Club with horses and stables around you and there's loads of Forrest surrounding you. It's a lively setting.The food is quite good but my breakfast was cold (or not hot actually). Tasty but just not quite.Coffee is very good and the kids milk shakes are unreal!!Price is very reasonable and the service pleasant.Well absolutely come back but won't have the big English Breakfast.
5
Wonderful green location
An oasis in the (turf) city
Great brunch
Service with a true smile
Total value for money !
4
Riders cafe is located next to the stables and kids had a good time going for pony rides and playground while the adults enjoyed their brunch. Food portions were good and price reasonable.
5
Quiet country location (old stables), good fresh and interesting food and teas. Great sitting out on the verandah.
2
Smell at the place was not so good due to horses urines. Toilet also very dirty and no water to wash hands.
5
It was a good weekend spent.
Service was prompt. If you are looking for a cosy brunch, this is the place for you.
5
Great mains and great service. The special mains that night - slow cooked beef cheek, was the star of the meal.
4
The homemade sausage with scrambled egg on rosti, though tasty, needed a contrasting flavour on the plate as it started to get "flat" after a while. Perhaps a grilled tomato or a salsa on the side. "The Usual" - eggs, bacon, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes and bread could not be faulted. The side order of toast took a while to arrive and was not as freshly toasted as we would have liked. We also enjoyed the Morning Jumpstart i.e. the Bloody Mary which we highly recommend.Ambience is lovely. Not air-conditioned but lots of fans for air-circulation, and pleasant horse and country views. Be prepared to spend at least $30 a head (excl the Jumpstart!)
4
have been here 5-6 times now, has a nice relaxing ambience, good for gatherings or to bring your partner. can get crowded so do make reservations in advance. food is pretty decent, though typical pricey brunch prices. service so far has been decent overall, though it can be a hit-and-run at times. one of the better/ more unique brunch places in Singapore
4
We made a reservation and do not need to wait. The food waiting time is ok, but I have expected the drinks to come faster. Food was well-prepared, reasonably priced. I like the scones set $9, 2 pieces with generous jam, butter and cheese cream. The crab omelette was perfect too. Note: The area all around is private property. I happen to meet one who was not so friendly about me just seeing her horse
2
I took 3 kids for lunch this past week. My daughter, whose birthday it was, her BFF and my son.I thought I would treat them to a lovely lunch with a walk around to have a look at the horses. i made reservations, arrived on time. The restaurant was not packed. We were seated, and were provided menus.all the other tables had carafes of water - after fifteen minutes of no service, I asked for the water and to place our orders.The kids menu was extremely limited with two items for lunchtime (the other 2 items were available till 11 am). In the end, we ordered 4 items to share - which the kids did not like.I had mentioned at the time of reservations that it was my daughter's birthday - I had hoped they would do something a little special - she is a young child and would get a kick out of it - but service left a lot to be desired that day.The meal was not cheap for what we received and experienced.I keep on giving this place a second and a third chance because its got great ambience and views - but maybe, I would just stick with going there myself for a reprieve and having a coffee

Amazing place for brunch, great location outside busy Singapore, nice atmosphere great staff. Everything me and my friends ate was delicious: from the smoothies to the eggs, bread and French toasts. Also, the staff was very nice. Strongly recommend it!
5
Food quality was good, nice ambience and service was prompt. Got a window seat and could see horses go by.
5
Rider's provides a quaint environment, ideal for a perfect catch-up with friends and family. Service was prompt and food did not disappoint expectations. The rider's burger is a must-try!
4
Restaurant was very busy on a Saturday but the waitress was very helpful in taking our orders. Food was special, with western and Mediterranean influence.
5
Food and scenery was good，just that the service was a little slow. Other then that everything was enjoyable. (:
5
Friendly staff and good food. However, food took slightly longer to come. Overall experience is good though.
4
Place is quiet and peaceful on a Friday night. Staff are attentive and helpful. Great place to unwind for the weekend after a week of work :)
3
Location wise, good if have own transport.Made reservations but still need to wait quite a fair time before seated. Food pricing on the high side, but not too bad.Service can also be better.Nice scenery though but can be quite noisy during the weekends crowd.Great to bring kids there, can see horses & maybe bring the kids for a pony ride if there early
3
It is non air conditioned but it is tranquil and peaceful. Was here with 3 other friends for lunch. We ordered 4 portions of food to share, the daily special which was pork belly but it was way too fat, hardly any lean meat. The portobello burger was also not great. It was ordinary and teh portion was small. The avocado crab salad was also a disappointment
5
if you are looking to dine in a cosy, authentic western cuisine restaurant look no further! I really enjoyed the Rider Burger; the meat was seared just the way i liked it :) great ambience and dining environment as well, loved the alfresco view of the hills and horse stables!
2
Is hard to get the service team's attention. And the food quality has really dropped. What's not, I reckon is the premise.
5
It is almost impossible to reach here by public transportation as the nearest bus stop is a long hike down (20 minutes away).
4
Secluded. Quiet. Nice place to getaway for a nice meal. The burger was very very good. Fried chicken BLT was disappointing. The burger saved the day.
3
The ambience was great with nice view, and furnishing. However, the menu was kinda limited and food was a little on the pricey side. Service was great though!
5
Food was good. Staff were great. Parking was not a hassle. Highly recommended to go on a weekday. Will go again.
5
The ambience is good overlooking the horses and greenery. The carpark was having construction work going on, hence, it was abbot hard to find parking. Food was good with varieties. It was quite crowded and the service was quite slow.
3
Watermelon crab salad: watermelon taste little sour. Is not fresh at allGet seated, straight asking us what is our order as the menu was just given right away. Question is how do I able to make an order as I yet to review my menu!!! Advise to install an adjustable lighting. As the light is tooooo dim. We have difficulties on reading the menu. Overall, not a very good experience
4
A good venue and deco for people who drives as this place is hard to find! The atmosphere is very chilled out and the servers are very attentive. Food wise is just so-so, but can be a good hangout place if you happen to be in bukit timah
3
Went on a Friday afternoon close to 2pm and I was really surprised at the crowd! Didnt expect such a huge crowdful of people on a weekday afternoon! Fortunately with chope reservations I managed to secure an al fresco dining seat as requested. The ambience is really great with a scenic view while chilling and enjoy a comfort brunch with friends. The waiting time for food was eternally long though, with a >30 min wait. Prices are on the steep side with an average main course costing $25-$30. We ordered the scallop risotto and the festive special - sea urchin cream tagliatelle with tiger prawns and fish roe which were both decent and enjoyable. Personally preferred the scallop risotto as the sea urchin cream tagliatelle was a tad too creamy and gelat for one. On the other hand, the pan fried scallops were fresh with a chewy mouthfeel though a little charred on the exterior. Overall a not too bad dining experience if only the waiting time for food is not that long! ><
5
This was my second visit to the cafe. Went there with my friends. The cafe is very children friendly, with a nice scenic view of the natural surrounding. Food is good and their service is also prompt. Greeted with a smile as well. Will definitely revisit the place in the near future
5
The place has a great view. It's a good place for brunch. I'll bring my family there for a good weekend outing!
5
While the location isn't ideal without a car, yet it is the location that makes this restaurant unique. Away from the hustle and bustle of city life.
Food was good. Serving size is reasonable. Service was prompt and attentive.
4
A rare environment. Preserved Heritage. Great food and efficient team. Want to be somewhere unique. Head There !
5
The food was tasty and fresh. Crew members are friendly and cheerful. Its a ggod practice that to re-confirm for the reservation and follow up with text msg. Thanks again and I will certainly recommend your restaurant to others.
5
we had breakfast / brunch and it was really nice. very good food, very friendly and professional staff and a very good location.
will come back...
4
Nice ambiance and quality food. Awesome truffles fries that my friends and I love so much! I appreciate their good customer service too.
5
Love this restuarant. Their food is good and service is prompt even when they are full house (which is most of the time). This place is very family friendly. Because it is situated next to the stables, you will have many chances to see horses walking around. This place will not disappoint.
4
I have been here several times in the past month. I love the ambience here - quiet and the sight of horses is comforting. The latte here is excellent. Long black is quite strong and bitter though. The food is also great. I highly recommend quinoa salad. For breakfast, you can create your own plate
5
Halfway through our meals, my wife found a piece of plastic in her French toast which obviously should not have been there. We told a wait staff about the foreign object and was met with apologies and a promise of a new plate of French toast. The new plate of French toast came shortly after as promised and both of us went on to enjoy the rest of our Christmas brunch. However, the surprise came when we got the bill and realized that the French toast was on the house. Thanks for the excellent service recovery and the nice Christmas Day surprise. Food as usual was good! We look forward to our next trip to Rider's
4
We went for lunch to rider's cafe on a day when the weather was amazing - very pleasant, not too sunny. The ambiance is very laid back and nice. Food for us was ok, nothing spectacular. We did like our milkshakes and juices though. We had scrambled eggs, chicken blt, beef burger and pasta.
4
Had the lemon ricotta pancakes , was brilliant previously. Now I feel it's only ok. Not as fluffy as before
4
None aircon place but place was kept cool with fans. Service was great! Food was good. Easy and free parking outside.
4
Went for brunch with girlfriend, atmosphere was great. Went at 9.30am so the weather was still cooling, but it could be hot in the afternoon. Food was awesome!
4
The food and service was good. We were seated at the balcony thus have a great view of the green and horses in the stable. Have been there many times and it still as satisfying 😀
4
We had an enjoyable brunch at riders cafe. They offer really good old comfort food and the view on the side was great, with the horses roaming around. Almost forgot we were in Singapore!
4
Presentation and taste were acceptable for this sort of cafe in Singapore. The real draw is the setting and the horses you get to see. Good service though they seem a little short handed.
Will come again to try the $10 pony ride for kids.
3
Ever reliable venue for bringing guests. Service a little overwhelmed though. Menu might need a overhaul - for the regulars!
1
Ordered the cowboy steak hangar in medium, the beef turned out to be very tough and looked like it's been cooked to medium well or well done. We also ordered the beef burger in medium rare, turned out it was like well done too, and the beef patty flakes off when cut. The fries tasted like they had been cooked and left in the kitchen for a while too. The chicken burger was equally bad - meat was tough and dry to chew. We ordered a bottle of wine and asked for only 3 glasses of wine glass since one of our diners does not drink. The waiter served us with only 3 glasses of wine instead of a bottle. When we asked for a bottle instead, he said it was a fresh bottle and will return the bottle of wine to us. One of the staff waived off the item for the cowboy steak hangar, but did not tell us about it. We weren't really looking for discounts or a replacement for the meal, but the service is really disappointing and the food a great letdown
4
beautifully restored stables, rustic ambiance and excellent food. staff was neither flexible nor helpful with a simple request of adding two eggs (which is offered as part of their breakfast menu) to a salad order. its a kitchen for crying out loud. what sort of diabolically different "production process" can grabbing two eggs, poaching them n water and popping it atop the salad be from the lunch service? this was a blight on an otherwise utterly delightful first visi
5
My friend and I had an enjoyable time at this cafÃ©, though the food is quite pricey. We spent on ave. $30 each (incl. service charge & GST). Pan Fried Snapper - $26; Portobello Sammie - $23; Bottled Still Water - $5. Food is delicious and we totally love our meals. I'd say for the price, you are actually paying more for the location uniqueness (In the Bukit Timah Saddles Club). Do note that as you eat your meal, be prepared to bear a little of the smell from the horses stables. It's part of the entire experience! Bon appetit
3
Food and ambience were ok but the cost could be cheaper. I would recommend this place to people who want as change from ordinary shopping dining.
5
its my 2nd time at riders.. experience is as gd as the 1st. prompt service, & love the brunch there. pacific benedict is my favourtie.
mocha float was gd too.
ordered 2 drinks, 2 brunch mains, 1 side, 1 dessert & amounted to $85.
5
Went with my wife and really enjoyed the food. Reservation was simple and efficient. Remember to try the Death by Chocolate Cake
5
Good food and service. Was promptly seated upon arrival and made comfortable as we just got there from a long morning walk. Refreshing orange juice and great breakfast!
4
Had an enjoyable breakfast at Rider's despite the slight rain. Nothing beats a cozy restaurant with a therapeutic view of the horses doing their morning galloping.
4
Love the mushroom sandwich , taste good! and love the environment. friendly staff and good service! will visit again!
5
The wait for dinner wasn't too long, rider's cafe burger was tasty and the salad fantastic. Service was good with waiter responding promptly and checking in on how the food was. Excellent food! For all the above, it will cost more than your usual cafe so take note of that
2
We'd heard great things about Riders and made a booking as advised. So let's be clear....it's a cafe at a riding school; the open air balcony comes complete with the constant waft of horse manure just to prove it. The service is friendly but basic, the menu is uneventful and the food was ordinary. My wife had the sea bass; nicely cooked but lost in the overpowering sauce. My Daughter and I had the steak with fries ($35 each); everything was lukewarm at best except my fries which were simply cold. My boy had the chicken "goujons" which were over fried and hard as nails. The milkshakes were nice and the $80 bottle of Watervale Riesling was very good. So, for a total of $250, we had a basic, lukewarm meal, accompanied by the aroma of horse manure, in a cafe. You live and learn!
4
We visited Rider's Cafe about 2 years back and because we don't drive, this cafe can only be in our hearts and not on our 'must visit often' list. Well, it's still very much the same at our recent visit, but the staffs appeared to be friendlier, checking with us about food quality and all. We ordered something we missed like French Toast with Burnt Banana. We also tried something new like Rider's burger and Watermelon and Crab salad, which were both excellent. You don't see a lot of such places in Singapore, it's a rare country side and nice get-away once in awhile. It can be a little pricey though
3
Average is the word that keeps coming to mind. The venue is right next to the stables, so alot of the custom comes from riders and their friends/family. As others have mentioned, there's no air conditioning, so sit out on the veranda if you can. The chairs are uncomfortable - mostly solid wood seats. The service was slow, in fact we had to waylay someone to place our order. The food was slow coming and part of our order was wrong. The food itself was okay, but again 'average' is the best description. It is also over-priced
5
Good tasting food with a good view. Service was excellent with waiteress checking on food n service once in a while. I will be back to try the dinner entrees. Hope it works out well.
4
Out of city experience and location. Good for those who love to hunt for out of norm cafes and restaurants. Food wise mostly western breakfast.
5
The environment was a good place to chill out and have brunch, away from the bustling Singapore city. They serve all day breakfast which was really delicious. Will be back!
5
Best place to have an early brunch. And the view was simply breathtaking. Will definitely come back for more intimate dining here.
4
We had to cab in to the cafe from sixth avenue mrt.The food was good, but waiting time for the food a bit long. We had a good view of the horses as we had a table outside. After lunch , we had to call for cab in order to get out
4
We had a pleasant time here. The food was reasonably good and the view of the surrounding fields took us into the counyryside. We couldn't ask for more.But the weather was quite humid and surprisingly the cafe is not air-conditioned. It could have installed glass panels and air-conditioned the cafe. Or alternatively it could have installed some misty fans.So we wouldn't want come back in the daytime for sure.
2
Ambience was good, being within a stable club. However, food was really poor. The truffle fries were really oily, but there wasnt the aroma of the truffle oil and there wasn't any cheese shavings on top. Add to that, the fries were soggy, with no crispy out skin. Rissoto with scallop was ok, but the pork chop was tough and the snapper was bland and skin wasn't crispy, even though it was supposed to be pan-seared or baked.
4
Visited many times previously, never disappointed by the cosy cafe setting, reliable service and good food. Love the environment - tucked away from main streets and city centre, with plush green surroundings, and the occasional sighting of horses ridden past. Love that it is set in a colonial b/w building, great high ceilings and cosy ambience.
4
Nice Environment with satisfied food. Despite the inconvenience of the location, the cafe is always full house during the weekend. A reservation is recommended to avoid for disappointment. After your meal, you can walk around the turf club and you can see some horses.The place located at a very nice place but far from everywhere. It is not near to MRT nor bus stop. the best way to travel in is by car. it is also hard to get taxi after certain hour
4
The cafe is nestled among the horse straddle club which is a good venue for families with small children. Food is good but if you really want to enjoy the food, consider sitting indoors instead of balcony. Otherwise, you also get to smell the horses while enjoying the greenery, together with the food. Service is also good, only puzzling thing is we had to wait 5 to 10 min to be seated at our table (which was already ready then) as we were earlier than our reservation time by 10 min. Must make reservation to avoid disappointment
4
Food and ambience of the cafe was good. Cafe was quiet and empty during weekday noon. Good for a short getaway from the busy city for a couple of hours.
5
I went on a weekday so it was not crowded. Service was good and food arrived pretty quickly. I love that you can sight horses as well!
5
Looking for a place, no so like "Singapore"? Surrounded by trees, greens, horses. Kids just love it.
Food is good. Price is decent. Service is good. Overall, happy, 2nd time visit. I guess will come back for the 3rd time and more....
5
This place is amazing and awesome!!! The brunch is awesome while you can enjoy the view of greenery and horses... Very family oriented and the best part is the kiddos can have pony rides @ $10....
4
Great cafe located outside of the city centre. The pony rides available for kids makes this a great weekend family spot. Good food and staff are friendly.
3
typical brunch food. nothing outstanding. service staff tend to be rather disinterested and inattentive when customers need assistance, definitely something to work on.
5
Easy to find despite it's location. The boy loves the Rosti, but I thought it should be a little more crisp. will go back again.
2
Despite having made a reservation, my table was not ready on time (imagine my frustration given that I had arrived 15 minutes early and ended up waiting close to half an hour for my table). To add to that, it was extremely noisy and thereforr virtually impossible to have a conversation.
4
Good brunch and service. Only that i have indicated in my remarks to prepare a cake for my friend meant to be a surprise but the waiter came and blow the cover by telling my table that we have ordered and a cake and if we need side plates.
4
Good ambience, like the quietness though if you don't drive, it's a bit more pricey to get in (grab a cab/car/uber) unless you take a 25min walk. The food was fantastic! and I love the rusticness of the place. My family enjoyed the place and food a lot as we celebrated my brother's birthday
4
It has a nice ambience and though no AirCon, it was cooling.
Food was quite good for some of the items on the menu.
I really a good experience and will visit again.
4
Food was ok, staff is very helpful and hope to see more breakfast or tea time set menu;
With car, for sure we will visit again.
5
A warm and vibrant experience at this cafe - service was attentive and food was delicious.
Bonus - get to see all the pretty horses :)
5
The Rider's Cafe is a delightful place with a great variety of choices for brunch. Service was great and generally friendly. Worth a visit if you do not mind the travel.
5
Pleasant atmosphere and good food. Attentive staff and ample parking. Stayed and chatted for over 2 hours.
4
Friendly staff, nice food, good spot to hang out, away from city.. The only cons is you will have to drive or take cab there..
3
Had dinner at Rider's cafe recently on a warm evening which can be a bit muggy if theres not much breeze. Contrast with lunch where the stables are a hive of activity, its quiet and peaceful in the evening. We had a simple cafe evening meals where we had the lamb shank (a bit dry with mushy mediterranean couscous & tomato base) and sirloin steak (decently grilled and well aged). I prefer to go for lunch where the unique stable ambiance enhances a rustic atmosphere
5
Good ambience for girls' chit-chat/gossip time in the quiet surrounding away from the city. Be there before sunset to visit the stable to see the beautiful horses. You may also catch rider on pony strolling leisurely along the road while dining.The food is excellent with reasonable portions at affordable prices. Simply love their signature dessert "Death by Chocolate Cake". Complete your meal with a good selection of beverages.Great service too. They replaced the entire chicken dish with no questions asked when we discovered that part of the chicken was not fully cooked after finishing almost half of the outer part
4
Rider's burger was not available that day and the waiter was not informed until the kitchen informed him and he came back to us to take our orders again. I think this can be improved. I tried the scallop risotto, it turned out to be too salty for my palate. Cappuccino is good.
5
We went there in celebration of my boyfriend's birthday and it was great! We sat by the window overlooking Heaven Hill. It was a wonderful experience as we could see the horses trotting by as we tucked into our food, without it being too sunny. Food and coffee was awesome as well
4
Impromptu dinner for the day. We were extremely impressed with the food. The portion was great for sharing. Another place worth dining, that you would want to come back again😀
5
Situated away from the city, Riders Cafe offers a unique experience for everyone. Horses roam nearby, food is excellent and staff are friendly and accommodating. The Usual is a must try if you like all day breakfasts.
4
Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. Summer soup of cucumber avocados with crab meat was refreshing and beef ball appetizer was delicious.
4
It s a good place to have brunch or meal with friends. Good ambience and greeted with helpful and friendly staffs.
5
good foood good service and good atmoshphere. will be going bck soon to eat! nice! highly recommended
4
Firstly, you definitely need a car to get to Rider's Cafe. It's quite deep inside and hard to reach without private transport. But that's also the beauty of Rider's Cafe. It's set in a place that takes you out of the bustle of the city and Singapore life, and puts you into this feeling of being in the country-side or in another country.Rider's Cafe is located next to horse stables, so you get to see horses train or run about while you eat (if you're lucky... if not, the horses would just be in the stables.) It's a beautiful setting that makes great ambience. I love coming in the mornings, where the weather is nice and cool. Their brunch is not bad; nothing really outstanding, but all generally good tasting. Their coffee is also decent. Their lunch menu is quite nice. I had the lamb shank which was really nice, as was their Rider's Burger, which was big. We also tried their appetisers of Buffalo balls or something, but that was underwhelming. Word of advice: It gets very crowded on weekends, so I'd avoid coming then. If you can, make a trip down on a weekday instead. It's quite empty.Come in the mornings for brunch, where the weather is cool. And maybe just maybe you have a better chance of seeing the horses run about
3
We had a reservations in advance for my hubby's birthday. Arrived 15 mins early and queued like most folks to be attended to. Some smart Alec Caucasians waltzes in ahead of us and to my disgust, the server ignores us and chooses to serve them first ! Even though they obviously didn't queue. When I raised my objections she tried to say they had reservations. And I replied I also have made a reservation and why can't they queue like everyone else! Only then did she apologize in a blasÃ© manner. Horrid start to what was meant to be a lovely Sunday birthday brunch. The brunch items we had - The usual and pacific Benedict were quite well done. Other than that the beverages and ambience was just ok. Very echoey place and hard to have a decent conversation. The servers look lost and congregated near the counters. I saw our neighboring table got up to get their attention for ordering and the server walked off to get someone else. The man looked very annoyed, no least. In short, it's an over rated place for brunch and not worth your time and 'grief'.
4
This place has great ambience, next to the horse stables without air conditioning. We are usually here in the evenings and have only been here once during the day and the temperature was fine. The Death by choc cake is really rich and tastes different from other choc cakes we've had in Singapore - even my son who is a chocolate lover could only manage half of it's portion. The lamb shank is delicious. Steak and fries is great too - large portion of steak though we do wish they would change the cut of the meat to at least a ribeye (even a smaller piece would be better.) as it's a little tough. We love the gravy as it's not the usual pepper or brown sauce that most restaurants in the similar league serves.
5
Came here with a bunch of friends when it was less crowded on a weekday. Parking was easy. We also made a reservation in advance just in case as we heard it could get crowded.We ordered four appetisers amongst ourselves - crab and watermelon salad, grilled squid, truffles fries and bacon popcorn. They were all beautifully presented and extremely delicious. I would highly recommend any of these dishes to try! Service was also good. We spent about 20++ each after tax.All in all I would recommend this place and would come back if given the chance.
4
This place is worth a taxi ride (if you don't drive). It is hidden from the main road and rewards those who make the effort with a great ambience and good food. The restaurant is in a colonial bungalow with its wooden floors and wide open windows. The food is very good and you will struggle to settle on just one main dish. We went for Sunday lunch and the place was packed. Book ahead of time if you plan on visiting on a weekend
4
Nice place but food is rather pricey . No AC . Restaurant can be little humid. It will be good if there are must fan.
5
It was my first trip to Rider's Cafe. Location was quite out of the way. Need own transport to reach there. Food and service was great. Though its non-aircon, there were ceiling fans to keep us cool.
5
Very friendly service staff. I'll definitely do a revisit in future. Beautiful scenery and delicious brunch, what more can I ask for.
5
Settled on riders cafe for our brunch date. Service was impeccable, staff were extremely attentive and helpful. Loved my ice mocha - done to perfection. Prices were really reasonable too. I would definitely revisit :)
3
As mentioned above, nice place to have brunch but my food came warm, not hot.. My partner had burger where the party just falling apart
3
Mains were rather pricey and staff were not attentive as they congregated at the counter to talk most of the time.
5
The food was fantastic as usual! Since it was cloudy it wasn't hot. Very attentive waiters and waitresses. Where else in Singapore will the waiter/waitress asks you how's the food :)
3
Be sure you make a reservation as this place is really packed during weekends. If you want to be seated at a place overseeing the stable, request so (not by the window). Also be prepared that this place has no air-cond but only fans (though there's air-cond in the toilets)I ordered the pacific benedict which comprises of crab meat cake, poached eggs and salmon bits...not too impressed to be honest. My friend had the fried chicken BLT burger which looks really good...a bit too noisy for me as there were lots of families with young kids.
5
It's our second time coming here. First was for a dinner in 2015. That went really well. So we wanted to try out their brunch menu. We ordered 1) Brioche French Toast with burnt banana, bacon, honeycomb butter & 2) Pacific Bendict(crab cakes, poached eggs, smoked salmon, hollandaise)..One was sweet and the other savoury..A perfect combo..Crab cakes were fresh, eggs done well and came well-balanced with salads..Brioche French Toast was my favourite as it is really sweet and I can't stop having more of it..For dessert we ordered the Salted Caramel Brioche with vanilla ice cream, since we already tried their more popular Death By Chocolate cake in our previous visit..The hot caramel covered brioche was a good complement to the cold vanilla ice cream..It was AWESOME..So sweet..The only negative point was travelling to the location, as we had to take a cab in and out of the place..But it was definitely worth it with the amazing food and therapeutic atmosphere with galloping horses.
4
Initially I booked my reservation at 12pm, but due to traffic congestion, I wasn't able to make it on time. The waitress who took my call was nice enough to reserve a seat for me 30 mins later which I'm really thankful. It was my first official date after so long and riders cafe is what my date wanted to visit. The atmosphere was good, food was terrific and customer service was stunning. Great experience
4
It was a good experience. Service was really good. But the food served was a little cold which I believed it was pre-made. But everything else was really good! =)
4
Nice ambience, good food. Weather was humid unfortunately. Good drive to get away for a while. You got to try the dessert!
3
I guess my title sum-up perfectly the place. It's quite cool and fun to go eat there in the middle of the horses but the food is not amazing and the service is VERY VERY poor. Cool to do once only.
1
Waited 15 min to place an order, staff was walking around and didn't bother to come up to us. During the whole stay staff ignored us. Food was cold.
4
Nice environment, fresh air and a new experience. Food was great although slight on a pricey end. Will come back for their brunch menu soon.
4
Had a lovely breakfast with my friend. Love the place and really nice coffee. The food was average but the service was really good. Will be back
2
We came for breakfast after so many months and went out disappointed. The setting was nice, horses, trees, and the mood. We ordered the homemade sausage with rosti and another pancakes. Rosti was just shaved potatoes with no taste. Give me McDonalds fries anytime. Pancakes were soggy and not fluffy airy. Again, McDonalds make better pancakes. Don't come for the food, at least I know the food we ordered weren't up to any cafe's standard, more like some teenages trying to cook at home
3
This place must definitely be reached by a car. We tried to be adventurous and walked all the way in from the nearest MRT station. It took slightly more than 30 minutes to walk in. You would pass by Bukit Timah Saddle Club where you would see kids and adults alike, riding on the horses. Since the cafe was situated just slightly further down the saddle club, sitting near the perimeter of the cafe would be unbearable as the smell of the horses and its area would be extremely overpowering. We chose a table in the middle of the cafe. Ordered three mains and a dessert to share: too full! If you are sharing, try not to order both a steak and a burger. The meat in the burger (Angus Beef) tasted just like the Steak Frites. The spaghettini vin Blanc was very good. We like it the most. The dessert, Death by Chocolate Cake, would really result in the death of your tummy if you bought one each! Please share that giant piece of dessert! The drink we ordered was fresh lime cooler. It was very refreshing. They seemed to be a little shorthanded. Overall, the food was good.
4
Great place for brunch or dinner, surrounded by the lush greenery of the Saddle Club and Bukit Timah golf course. Spacious, airy and polite service, makes this one of my favourite escapes in Singapore. Food is delicious (Pacific Benedict is very nice) and if you sit on the balcony, you can watch trainers and young kids ride the horses during their lesson. If you don't have a car, you'll need to get a taxi out here. Great place to visit with friends or family with young kids. Only thing I could fault was the salted caramel brioche...it was basically fried (?) pieces of brioche with ice cream and caramel sauce; incredibly sweet and not that tasty unless you fancy a spoonful of sickly sweet sugar with every mouthful of your dessert, but don't let that deter from you visiting, as there are other great food options on the menu
5
Situated next to the Bukit Timah Riders Club, this is a perfect spot to get away from the pace of the city. It's a very green area set back away from the main roads. The building itself is an old stable converted into a cafe/restaurant. There's also free parking onsite. It's normally open-air with the balcony area available for seating if you prefer. Nice spot to watch the horses and have some relative quiet. Found the brunch/lunch menu to be especially good. The buffalo mozzarella meatballs were excellent, had to order these more than once on each visit. A cozy spot with good food options. Coffee/expresso, beer/wine are available. Service was solid, overall a very good experience.High chairs are available for kids. Note though, it's a short walk up some steps from the front door if you bringing a stroller or wheelchair

Visited the cafe on my birthday, far, no transport into the cafe unless u drive. Food nice and staff friendly.
5
Excellent service and quality of food! A definite must order - dessert - the death by chocolate cake!
5
Small quibble that the coffee could have been hotter but other than that everything was pretty near perfect.
3
The place was too warm for gathering. Everyone was sweating even the kid. Would suggest to place more fans around or air conditioned? And the chocolate cake was a huge disappointment. It was hard and unacceptable. Will consider whether to come back again.
5
Third time at Riders Cafe, and again, the food and service did not disappoint. The bone-in pork loin was excellent!
3
When we visit, the weather was scorching hot, thus the fan above us blows the hot air in. abit unbearable. Everything was good.
5
Superb choice for a lazy brunch in the midst of green turf. We had gone there for a birthday celebration with the family, had great food and service.
2
Venue was real hot and the management could install more fans to make it cooler. They do take reservations which is cool. Dining with views of the horses lazing around makes it a relax dining session though u will be able to smell the horsey's poo poo ocassionally.Food is decently priced with some hot selling menu like a) The usualb) Death by chocolate cake.The rest of the items i ordered seems quite not to my liking especially the caramel desert which is crazily sweet and almost inedible.Parking is also limited but the crowd is not too much. Service from the staff is prompt and friendly. Overall an experience to chill and relax. However your may be disappointed if you were there just for the food

I've read about this place but since it's not easy to go to without a car, I have not been to until now... because I have a rental car Arrived for a late lunch around 130pm with the family on a Sunday, waiting time was not bad. All the food were good, even the pasta on the kids menu. We had brunch and it was a happy surpise for the beef taco breakfast. It still tasted like breakfast, even for a taco. The real must have is the salted caramel brioche. Riders Cafe is known for this and now I know why.Will be coming back to this place, when I have a rental car again
3
Went to celebrate friends' birthday and we ordered fried chicken BLT,Smoked Salmon,Duck ragu and snapper together with starters:bacon popcorn and fried squid.Starters were good but the entrees were average except the snapper.Would not order the duck ragu again as the duck meat was in bits and pieces and was "hidden" within the pile of pasta.The sauce was not flavourful either.The fried chicken was seasoned but it didnt look appealing as expected from the price of this dish.We didnt like the ambience as it was quite stuffy having our lunch there.I would initiate to have more portable cooler air devices installed or placed in the premises
4
Thoroughly enjoyed my brunch at Rider's Cafe. It was my first visit, and I had heard so many good reviews about it before. Staff were helpful and prompt, and always friendly.
Mushrooms a tad off-tasting but the rest was great! Will definitely visit again :)
3
Reservation might have been overlooked. Had to wait for the staff to clear a table. Seating was like a walk in rather than reserved.
4
Food is delightful. Service prompt.
The chicken buffalo meatballs with mozzarella is yummy. The California burger is one of the best burgers!
4
Excellent food, nice and cosy ambience. Perfect for a quiet night out away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
5
Went there for brunch. Service was excellent, food was yummy, pricing was reasonable and the ambience was nice.
4
Always love this place. The food, service and ambient.
So glad to experience the same great service despite general service standard decline in F&B sector due to labour crunch.
Keep up the good work!
5
Doesn't feel like Singapore at all. A good getaway for locals and tourists, to chill, and or to get away from the bustle.
5
Overall waiting time for food was not long and environment was great to chill-out. The staff there was friendly and responses fast to customers request.

Tucked away from the buzz of the metropolitan, this cafe is a haven for people who want a peaceful meal or tea. Getting to the cafe is simple - you drive or take a cab. There is free parking right next to it.It is open from morning until evening. The weekend brunch is the busiest period. You should call 2 to 3 days before weekends to reserve your table. Otherwise, walking in and getting a table on weekdays is usually no chore. The cafe is not air conditioned. However, it is cool enough for long dining because of the many fans and natural breeze. There is one thing - the smell of horses can get pretty strong if the wind direction is right.The food here is very decent. There is a large variety of western dishes to select from. Servings are generous. The beverage list is impressive as well. You have wines, cocktails, shakes, juices and soft drinks.My children love the House Truffle Fries here. I personally enjoy the Riders Burger best. End off your meal with dessert cake and coffee. It is a wonderful place to relax and chat
4
This is a great one for family with little kids. The food is yummy, the atmosphere relaxed and there are tons of distraction for the little ones. The little poney ride just next to it adds to a lovely morning. Best is to book in advance or show up early (we arrived at 9.30 and got lucky to get a table as it got really busy right after
5
Beautiful location and so so tranquil. There's some pretty top notch honest cooking going on in that kitchen. Absolutely love dinners here as we watch the horses get brushed down and cleaned up.
1
BBQ rib super salty, over cook too. T bone porkchop also too tough. Staff all hiding at counter. Got to wait quite a while before signal for Bill!
4
We ordered the lamb shank and pork chop. Pretty good. Nice view of the stables and lush greenery around. We went on a weekday so it wasn't that crowded.
4
A rural area where there are horses stable. Nice place for brunch and lunches. Near nature and cool afternoon make the lunch pleasant. Lunch is yummy and leave some space for dessert.
4
- Located at the Bukit Timah riding club, near a few expat clubhouses.
- Best to drive there.
- Food is average cafe fare, though it's pretty worth the trip, taste-wise.
- Mostly set up for dining in groups.
3
It's ok if you get a table next to the field. We had a view of the car park.
Food and ambience is decent though

In Summary:A seemingly classy café located in the midst of nowhere. Portions are generous but the quality of different dishes seems to differ. All in all, a good place to relax if going al fresco is what you like!*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:If you tried searching for this café from Google maps, it appears to be in the midst of nowhere, which is incredibly accurate! The entrance to the café is about 2 kilometres away and easy to miss. Even after you have entered, you may wonder if you have driven to the right place as there is nothing in sight for the next 10 seconds worth of drive. Do not attempt walking in from the main road, which is not accessible by public transport in fact. Driving in to the café will take about 3 minutes for your virgin visit as you constantly assure yourself that you are at the right location in the middle of nowhere. The place was recommended by my partner and it does seem to have a great reputation amongst the local ladies. 1. Service – 3.5 out of 5The service is erratic. We were greeted politely by the male waitress who led us to our seat. We were then ignored by the same guy for the next 20 minutes and served unhappily by the other female waitress. Just when we were about to conclude that the service is bad, both of them served us well by checking for feedback and replacing our bottle of water from time to time. We were subsequently ignored for the next 10 minutes when we wanted to call for the bill.2. Ambience – 4 out of 5Although you get to dine al fresco in the wretched Singaporean weather, there was never a moment where I felt a need for air conditioners. I was there after a brief drizzle, and the smell of grass and poo from the nearby stables is noticeable.3. Cleanliness – 4 out of 5The restaurant looks well maintained though it has an open air concept. No signs of decay despite the humidity.4. Taste – 4 out of 5We were there around 4.30pm and most of the mains were unavailable. We decided to order three appetisers to suppress our hunger. The truffle fries was served first and it had a good balance of truffle and salt. The sauces were well concocted, complimenting the truffle and never was there a moment where I felt that the fries were too oily. The bacon popcorn was served next and we were pleasantly surprised that it was indeed popcorn. The bacon blended well with the popcorn, giving a satisfyingly unique aftertaste. The mozzarella cheeseballs was the last appetizer to be served and it was an ingenious mix of spices and cheese! The cheese did not feel overwhelming when balanced with the spicy sauce. We never expected the appetizers to be that big a portion in a café like this, and we did feel full after the first three dishes. Not wanting to leave without trying the mains, we ordered some drinks to cleanse our palate. My partner ordered a pot of rose tea while I got the mocha milkshake. We were genuinely full but the greedy side got the better of us and we ordered the crabmeat pasta. Unfortunately, the pasta was lacklustre and a tad on the dry side. Lastly, we ordered the Death by Chocolate cake. It tasted fine, yet consists of a strange mix of cheap tasting ingredients if you were to eat them individually. The layer of cake was no better than those that you can find from neighbourhood confectionaries while the chocolate layer seemed like it was crafted from cheap milk chocolate. The sauce seemed very much like Hershey’s chocolate sauce. However, when all was mixed together, the feeling of cheapness was easily masked. The chef seems to know his stuff on the whole. Bad fortune on our part for the mains though. You might have better luck ordering the meat dishes.5. Value for Money – 4.5 out of 5The portions and taste is well-worth the money. The lack of a full score is due to the trouble that you have to go through in getting there
3
Riders' death by chocolate cake is my go to dessert every time I need my chocolate fix. It's not superb (you can find better cakes elsewhere) but give me cakes that swim in chocolate sauce - I'll definitely go back every time. I just love how generous they are with their portio
5
We've been coming to the Riders Cafe for many years now, almost always for Sunday brunch and the food and service are unfailingly excellent. The ambience is excellent, and whilst the place can get a little noisy with a late Sunday morning crowd, this just adds to the atmosphere, whilst the food is excellent - there've been changes to the menu over the many times that we've been but we've never been disappointed. Service is good, with the waiters always accommodating even if the place is busy. Only real downside is that one needs your own transport to come here easily
4
A nice place to visit once in a while to chill and relax. Ambience and the surrounding area relaxes the mind, picture greenery and the occasional horse trotting by :) Food's pretty good but it can be a little pricey (rental might be high, can't fault them for that), drinks are reasonably priced. Service wise, staff are pretty young thus a little shy in greeting and asking for orders. Senior staff could do better to respond to requests or show a better example. A simple greeting goes a Long way.
4
Nice "getaway" from the noisy city center. Only reachable by car/car. Make sure you get there before 11 am for breakfast.
4
We always enjoy our Sunday brunches at Riders Cafe. I can have their yummy burger with all the extras and my daughter can enjoy her "Usual" breakfast!
5
great dining experience at riders, staff was very helpful and friendly, food came promptly after ordering
4
Had a beautiful day out at riders cafe on New Year's Eve. Cafe was crowded but we got a table easily due to the reservation. Food was top notch; suggest that the chocolate cake to be shared between at least 3 people.
4
Food was average but the ambiance made up for it. You have to order the Death by Chocolate cos it's the most chocolatey thing ever. Best to cab there or drive there because it would be inaccessible by foot.
2
Food is great. We were seated at the balcony. It was breezy and the view is fantastics. I would visit the place again.
4
A wonderful way to live out a bright morning....fresh juice, crisp coffee, and a perfect eggs, and refreshing view in Singapore.
Make sure to bring some besties along. Such joy should be shared.
3
The cafe is nestled away beside a stable in Bukit Timah. The balcony seating which is probably the best seating in the house is perfect for a warm lazy afternoon tea/coffee over a large sinful portion of chocolate cake. Just had to give it a try.The cafe is open air without air conditioning, limited seating and can get quite noisy if the tables are filled. Suggest reservations in advance.
5
Nestled in a lush green corner of Bukit Timah, the cafe can be really inaccessible. But once you reach there you know that it is worth the effort. The cafe is located in a black and white colonial building giving it a nice warm feeling. We got the best seat in the house on the balcony overlooking the stable and the training ground. We ordered the Blackstone Benedict, smoked Salmon and sweet corn hash along with the Riders Burger. The food was really great, one of the best brunches i have had till now and the view one to die for.
5
My family had Christmas's Eve dinner at Riders Café, my 2nd time there. There was a special menu for Christmas. We ordered 3 main courses including Scallop Risotto, Ham and Spinach Stuffed Turkey and Snapper Fillet. We also ordered Chocolate Cake and Sweet Pears Slices as dessert plus a bottle of Australian red wine. The food was delicious and the environment was also good . (SG$205 in total, quite reasonable) It is remarkable that there is no public transport to Riders Café directly (at least 20 minutes walk to the main road).
4
Good food. Quirky but nice dining room - casual dress ok. Service was a bit slow, but we were not in a hurry so it did not really matter. Very pleasant evening, and we would go again.
3
The food was okay but the service was good! It is a nice place for brunch and coffee. We had a great time. Thank you.
4
Best hamburger in SG
The other menu items are a surprising mix of simple and high class items that are all excellent.
The service is great
The ambiance is casual and relaxing.
Reservations are highly recommended on the weekends.
5
Love the french toast that I've ordered, love the balcony seat as I can look at the greenery and horses without any view being blocked. the waiters and waitresses are attentive too. Great service good food great view!
4
The locations is quite far than public transportation , that's why it's unique than others, foods was nice, love the latte, however could be better if can place more fans for windows seat.
4
Love the fries, nice surroundings/ ambiance, old english feel and friendly staffs. Food portion just finish.
5
The brioche French toast is still so awesome but the beef breakfast taco was a tad dubious....for me I made online reservations but there were walk-ins who had to wait 1 hr on waiting list so always make early reservations!!!!
5
Nowadays I prefer to go to Riders Cafe in the evening when the bruch crowds are all gone. It is how it should be, you can finally enjoy a good meal in one of the quietest restaurants in Singapore, amidt nature. Food never disappoints, and their menu recently changed, a great welcome to the regulars. The lamb shank was delicious, although a bit lukewarm - please reheat it hot! And the angus burger never disappoints of course...The service was excellent, we were the only table toward the end but we were not hinted to leave as so often happens in Singapore
4
A very cozy place to have your dinner on a weekend night. The place is not huge and that explains why it is so cozy. It is not air-conditioned but it is not warm and humid inside. I believe because it is the only hut in an open big space. There are many parking lots and parking is free here.The service is good. The waitresses who served us are patient and polite. They recommended popular dishes and advised us. We love the truffle fries and the chocolate cake with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. The price can be a bit steep but the cozy dining experience made up for it
4
I had read lots of reviews of Riders Cafe as a great place to go for brunch, and I wasn't disappointed. I had tried to go several times before this Sunday visit, but the cafe was always fully booked. So I was happy to finally get a reservation (tip: book early).Service was good and attentive. The food and drinks were great. We had chocolate and strawberry milkshakes (my kids exclaimed "this tastes like melted ice cream, yummy!"), berries smoothie, bloody mary and lime juice -- all good.For food, the Riders Burger, grilled snapper, portobello sandwich and pacific benedict were great. The homemade sausages and scrambled eggs weren't great though. The extra sides of the mushrooms and potato hash wasn't good either (both were bland). The kids' french toast sticks could use more chocolate sauce or powdered sugar on them, but the texture was good.The highlight for all of us was the Truffle Fries. They have the best truffle fries in Singapore (so far, for us). Our family favourite used to be Kith Cafe for Truffle Fries, but now, we think Riders Cafe's truffle fries is better. Both the fragrance and the flavour of truffles permeates every fry. Delicious!Overall, we had a lovely meal and my kids enjoyed seeing the horses. It is a nice change from the usual mall eateries. The cafe is not air-conditioned though, so do dress lightly.It was a lovely brunch in a unique setting. We will definitely go back again
5
Food is good as usual. Sunday is usually filled with families. You will be able to see horses as well. Advance booking is strongly recommended.
4
Prompt service. Food was good. Love the open air atmosphere. Close to nature. Would definitely go again.
4
Great place to spend a weekend morning. Had breakfast and went around looking at horses. Enjoyed the lush field, refreshing way to start a weekend morning.
4
A nice restaurant for dinner. Lots of green and fresh air. Cozy too. Good with kids during lunch where you can see horses.
4
Food and service is great. Just a little in perfection in the booking system; my booking didn't show up in their system though it's captured in chope.
4
The location is pretty unaccessible without a car but that's kinda the best part about it. Situated among greens and overlooking the stables without air-con (but still cooling), a perfect place for weekend brunch. If you are in the mood for sweet, the brioche french toast would satisfy. For savoury, we tried the pacific benedict, a unqiue combination of runny egg yolk with crab cakes and salmon.
5
The food and the ambience at night was amazing! It was great having dinner in the glow of the candlelight outside with the night breeze. The cafe staff were very friendly as well. Make sure you are driving or taking a cab in and remember to turn left into Bukit Timah Saddle Club. Will be coming back soon to try their brunch menu
5
This cafe is tucked in fairways drive, just off Eng Neo avenue. My husband and I drove there for brunch on a weekend and sat by the balcony admiring the quiet scenery and overlooking the horses paddocks. We had the typical english breakfast and i highly recommend the place if you want to experience dining somewhere off the beaten track and away from your regular restaurants and shopping malls in town
2
We have been to Riders many times and usually enjoy it as the location and setting are gorgeous. However this time we went for lunch wanting something light and ordered the 'grilled squid salad with kale and lemon'. What came out was squid in a heavy chill sauce that drowned a very small amount of kale, making it soggy. Nothing like a salad at all. The squid didn't even seem grilled - more like sauteed in the sauce
4
One goes to Riders cafe for it's different setting them anywhere else in Singapore. The terrace is overlooking the manÃ¨ge in the middle of a green atmosphere. Now and then you even see monkeys passing by. The food is simple and good yet very much above average with a wide choice of dishes. The service is friendly and efficient. The cafe is boosting an easy-going setting
5
The staff were v friendly and approachable. Brunch was value for money with big portion and taste great!! The death by choc cake is a must try!!!
5
Very nice place to brunch or take a coffee. THe riders cafe is on top of the Bukit Timah saddle club so you can see horses around, and the food is excellent
3
Good food, generous portion. Service was speedy. However the restaurant was very packed. Reservation is recommended.
4
Lovely place amidst a quiet and serene surrounding to enjoy a good meal with loved ones. Good for couples and families too.
4
Open air so not good to visit during haze. No Aircon, only fans with open doors. Great food and good for breakfast or brunch.
5
I just luuuvvvv brunch... Anything with bacon & eggs would win me over anytime. Here brunch is available every weekend till 3PM! You can also ask for sxtra crispy bacon! I've been here several times and have brought different friends and family, we're never disappointed.
5
My wife and I had a great time at Riders Cafe. The food presentation was creative, and most all delicious. Although it is not an air-conditioned restaurant, the ventilation was good. Staff were prompt to attend to our request.
3
better than average food..worse than average service. i had a reservation for 7 on Saturday. i was basically ignored when my group entered the cafe. my grandfather who is 90 years old and obviously not the most stable on his feet was just left standing there. i had to force my way into getting the guy's attention and be firm in getting my table so that my grandfather could sit down.
1
Our reservation was at 1 but we had to wait almost 30mins to get our table. It took them 10 mins to Clean the table. Water was not served. Food quality was just average. Makes me wonder why people pay to eat here when the food is so so and there no aircon! I had heard a lot about this place but to me it's not worth the visit. Pricing is reasonable.
3
This cafe has one of my favourite locations in Singapore! I find the food a bit over priced and the service a bit hit and miss, but I always love the lush green surrounds! The menu is always appealing and there are always extra choices from the daily specials (although yesterdays special was sold out before noon?!
2
Nice venue but the good was mediocre at best and the service plain terrible. The waitress came back 4 times to ensure she got it right (!), yet brought the wrong food thrice (for 7 people) and the wrong drinks for all. Can't recommend it.
5
Delicious breakfast options! We had the eggs benedict and the smoked salmon corn hash dish and they were both amazing! Portions are perfect! I this the smoked salmon dish was my favorite. Definitely worth the drive/walk to this place! Staff was really good!
5
Food portions were generous, and setting was interesting. Definitely a must-go if you're looking for something different. It's only accessibly by car/taxi but that's part of the appeal of the location (that it's hidden gem!).
5
Had lunch with the wife, son and daughter today. Sonny boy suggested Riders as he'd heard a lotta good reports.He was right! The service was excellent and attentive, food was also superb. We had the pork tostadas which was a real palate teaser, I had the quinoa beetroot and kale salad which was light but delish. The scallop risotto was creamy and perfectly done.Best of all the ambiance, with the horses in their stalls in the background, and a cool breeze blowing through the ancient trees!
3
Ordered the brioche french toast with berries, while my friend ordered the pacific benedict. Brioche was a little too tough and french toast was not eggy enough. My friend enjoyed her pacific benedict but found the texture of the smoked salmon slightly weird.We also ordered the death by chocolate cake to share. Would recommend reducing the portion of the cake and lowering the price of the dessert as it is too big a slice and became too cloying after a while. Alternative would be to offer two serving sizes with different pricing.Though food wasn't excellent, ambience was nice. Laidback factor was definitely there. Would not go back anytime soon though, considering it is so out of the way, and the food wasn't fantastic
3
Nice place for a cuppa coffee but it has to be in the early morning when the sun is not out shiny hot yet. The cafe is with ceiling fans only and no AC. We were there at about 10.30am and can still feel the morning breeze but started to sweat a little towards the end of our meals :) I'm an eggs ben fan but I feel their eggs ben were over rated.
3
I had the steak while my partner had the burger. In all honesty, if you plan to visit, don't order the steak; go for the burger or something else instead.Steak wasn't that great for me. Nothing special and was quite cold. The burger was more flavourful but the fries that came with the burger tasted like fries made from frozen fries you get at the supermarket.
3
Ordered 1X Beef Croquette, 1X Pacific Benedict, 1X Death by Choc Cake.Positives:Food was tasty and fresh. Choc cake was rather unique, compared to typical cafe desserts.Service was reasonably good. Highlighted shaky table to a server, who immediately rectified it.Negatives:Both eggs Benedict were overcooked. The first yolk was barely runny, and the second was completely solid. Fedback to servers, who relayed it to the kitchen. They offered to replace the overcooked egg, but I did not want another egg. Sadly, was expecting them to make it up through other means, and I did not verbalise my expectation in hopes that initiative would be taken. Sadly none though.On the whole, not bad. But considering the star of the meal (the eggs) were done poorly, the nice meal was tarnished. Keep up the good work and look to improve, F&B is tough. Will consider returning if the management takes action regarding the eggs. Thanks
4
Quiet, tucked away location. Makes you feel like you've left the country, even if its just for the duration of a meal. I had the Quinoa starter. Quinoa, sweet beets, crunchy kale, feta, tomatoes topped off with a yoghurt dressing. One word. Divine. I wasn't going for anything too heavy, so this was perfection. I especially love that they left a whole flask of water on our table when I requested for just warm water. Worth the trip.
5
It was our first visit to Riders Cafe after having heard about it some time ago. The ambience was great as the setting is unique. The kids loved watching the horses in the stables throughout our meal. Service was excellent - the staff were attentive & proactive, one of them even took the initiative to move us to a table on the balcony to get a closer view of the horses. Overall a great experience & we will definitely go back again! 
4
Unique venue in Singapore. Pleasant restaurant to dine in. Good place for catching up with friends and relaxing.
3
I ordered the French toast and it was delicious. The flat white was bad though. All milk and coffee was non existent. One of the staff showed an attitude when I asked for a baby chair after waiting some time for it.
3
Visited this cafe in the afternoon where they only served starters and desserts. Their truffle fries was good and so was their death by chocolate cake (it was extremely chocolate-y). The balcony provided a view of the barns and horses. The cafe was pretty empty at that time. However, the food is slightly overpriced
5
Brunch on a late Saturday morning. The drive in was scenic and the weather was clear. we didnt make any reservation and we were told to wait for our turn as we were on waiting list. No problem.. we hung around a bit and waited in the holding area (it was a very warm day and it would be great if we had some fans to cool down). We were seated in approximately 20 minutes and got a balcony seat for 2. We ordered a picolo latte and an iced latte. Riders burger and eggs bennedict with bacon. Food was awesome! solid burger and fries and eggs perfectly poached. Eggs sit on top of grilled tomatoes and bacon and muffins.. yummy!! For dessert we had "death by chocolate cake", which was a sinful slice of chocolate cake in a chocolate sauce with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. One of the best I had.Great service and ambience, just wished that it was cooler (note: no air conditioning). I will definitely be back!
4
Mothers’ Day lunch was at Riders Cafe which is near where I stay but definitely requires you to drive there/hail a cab to get there.Food was great & I wiped out the Tacos clean. But I felt the Death by Chocolate cake was very overrated. Everyone raves about it, but to me it was just a lot of/too much chocolate on a plate; too overwhelming for me. Even though this one plate was shared amongst 4 people. It wasn’t bad or anything though, I’m just not a fan.Service was excellent (our waitress actually knew how to serve people & would do so individually, i.e. she wouldn’t pass plates to customers to pass to the other end) except they forgot our chocolate cake, but rectified it quickly. Halfway through our meal we were even asked how the food was– something that almost never happens in Singapore.Do note this is an open-air dining place, so for the easily sweaty (especially in this humid weather), this may not be the place for you
5
This was by far the best brunch experience we've had in Singapore. We ordered 'the usual' and everything was good - the mushrooms, sausage, bacon, bread and eggs. The bacon and banana brioche was also good. But really, it was the first rate service, the ambience and the environment that made the whole experience impeccable. It was very therapeutic sitting out on the balcony, sipping tea and observing the horses from afar. We felt like were out in the countryside. For about SGD27 per person, it was a very worthwhile treat
5
Riders Cafe feels like it belongs to another time and place - colonial charm, tranquil, great views of horses and lush greenery, making you feel as if you're in the English countryside. The food is excellent (we've tried the creme fraiche scrambled eggs with crisp rosti and Harissa homemade sausages, pan seared snapper and lamb shank) with service to match. The waiters always make it a point to check how we like our food halfway through our meal. Last time I went for breakfast, my friend said her fried potatoes were too hard and the waiter kindly and promptly replaced it with crisp rosti because my friend said she preferred my rosti! The salted caramel honeycomb and vanilla ice-cream was very scrummy Avoid the weekend brunch crowd if you really want to enjoy the ambience at its best and head there for relaxed weekday breakfasts (open at 8 am) and early evening meals when you can still enjoy the golden glow of sunset
5
Chope did a smooth reservation for me. It was seamless and i got my table immediately. It's my favourite off-the-road haunt, and during this visit at around 8pm on a wednesday night, the restaurant was pretty empty and mood was just laid back and beautiful, as compared to the full houses I experienced in all my other visits during lunch and brunch! Would recommend all to try their in house Burger and upgrade fries to truffle! And also their soup, cream of potato, was just a beautiful compliment to the main dish. Loved the quiet and soothing, non-aircon, fresh-aired ambience; and of course, the little candlelid table that was located at the sides of the place. Loved it much! Service was really great! Kudos to the team for accomodating our every requests, big or small!

I have dined here many times and tried both their breakfast and lunch menu. Wide variety of dishes from the menu with good vegetarian option. From the breakfast menu, I have tried their french toast which comes with mascarpone cheese and berries. The toast was fluffy and sweet. The berries and mascarpone cheese went well with the toast. I have tried their poached eggs with grilled tomatoes, mushrooms and creamy polenta. It was delicious and filling. From their lunch menu, I have tried almond coated chicken with creamy polenta and buttered spinach as well as their mushroom sandwich. The chicken was well cooked but it was tad bland. I love their Vanilla chai latte and devil's chocolate cake. The cake is definitely a must try dessert which comes along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Overall, this café has been consistently good and it's worth the visit, given its remote location and inaccessibility

Review TripAdvisor - Riders CafeRiders Cafe is one of my favourite places to have brunch In Singapore. It is located in lush greenery, near the saddle club, the fields and the champion golf course. I went twice to Riders Café, once with friends, once with family. Both times I had a great time: waiters are nice and reactive, food is home made and very good. This time I shared a Pacific eggs Benedict + a Riders Burger, it was great. Dessert was awesome: "Death by chocolate cake" is very good value for money! Haha: a really huge piece of cake (or maybe 3 pieces in 1) in a chocolate soup with vanilla ice cream on top of it..! Yummy! Will come back again! I totally recommend this place!
5
Food is good and the ambience is excellent. Came here the first time with my family, because of the reviews.
Just remember to make reservations early for weekend breakfast/lunch.

Good environment and friendly staff. Keep It Up!
Staff managed to reserve 8 table together although booking is table for 4/2/2.
5
Located in the middle of a riding club you sit surrounded by green fields, stables and horses. No traffic sounds which is so unusual in Singapore. The staff were super attentive, the coffee good and scones delicious. We'll be going back.

We went for dinner - 3 adults and 3 kids. The setting is beautiful, among the greenery of the Saddle Club of Singapore. Very casual, you don't need to dress up for this event!Food was reasonable with a number of good options for starters and mains. Service was not particularly good but it was a busy night. While the prices were not cheap the servings were quite big
5
One of the winning qualities of Riders Cafe is the rustic location as well as food. Just getting to the place is an adventure in itself. Great fare amidst verdant surrounds near the horses. Loved the creamy snapper and signature Riders Burger whilst the peanut butter jelly milkshake was unusually delicious! Go on weekdays if you don't enjoy crowds.

I have been wanting to go to Rider's Cafe for sometime now but due to its location, I always struggle. Finally, a brunch invitation from friends got me suggesting Rider's cafe right away and sure glad I did. We got reservations so we didn't have to queue. Reservations are essential if you are planning to go on a weekend as it tends to get fully booked. We just arrived on time although few friends were not there yet. They were nice enough to not hurry us on ordering and staff were all well-mannered and friendly.As for the food, I ordered "The Usual" with poached eggs, bacon, homemade sausage, and some rustic bread. The eggs were nicely poached which were still runny inside, just the way I like it. And with Death by Chocolate dessert to end up our already bulging bellies, was totalement delicieux! After brunch, we just chilled on the green patch in front of the restaurant were it was all shady and breezy. Spent the rest of the afternoon catching up and occasionally singing some cheerful songs.I would definitely come back if I have the chance

I have read a lot of good review about the food at riders cafe. I order a lamb shanks and my other half other a chicken braised with special sauce. chicken was dry and nothing to talk about. Lamb shanks was ordinary but the environment i great if you come in the afternoon as you can look at horses and is a tranquil place
5
The place is rather packed, booking are to made at least 1-2 weeks ago. This place will be great for group gathering. The food was great! Tried on Blackstone and pacific benedict, everything was great. The service crews were all on high alert, great service standard there. Will visit again when have the chance. :

Riders Cafe is perhaps our favorite brunch place in Singapore. Going there is like stepping out of the city into another world. The atmosphere is great, and the kids love the horses (you have to come early to see the action).The food is very nice too, even though we were a bit disappointed this time that some of our favorite items (berry smoothie, berry french toast) are no longer available or have changed. Make sure to plan ahead and reserve a few weeks in advance
4
awesome brunch at riders. heard lot about it before and finally went down. the location is off the road but thats what make it special. the food was great, special fries was delicious with the rose and lime sauce. the feeling of getting away from the crowd on a weekend makes this a great place for a weekend. service was great too!
4
The food was pretty good, and the environment is great. It took a really long time for the food to come, although it wasn't crowded.
5
The food is relatively good here, and the service is excellent, but what I love about it is the atmosphere. Casual, relaxed and chic. Perfect for outings with friends or family. Don't let the lack of air conditioning prevent you from visiting!
2
Service was fine but the overall quality and taste of food need vast improvement. We ordered salmon Eggs Benny, the 'Usual' and Death by chocolate. The breakfasts are so usual and forgettable, fortunately the cake was the savior of the meal.
4
Been wanting to come to this place for the longest time, however without transport it will be quite inconvenient to get in and out. It is an awesome place for celebration though. We enjoyed the scenery and there are also people training their horses nearby.
5
Ambient was good and service was fast and excellent. Food looks nice taste good. Will go back again.
4
Cool place for a lunch with an equestrian look and feel. You would not believe that you are so close to a big city as you sit in this tropical colonial style venue. The food is reasonable and the prices are ok. I had the Rider burger, which was succulent and highly recommended. My only complaint was that one of meals came after we had all nearly finished. We were a table of 8, but that should be manageable.Overall good.
5
Kudos to Eddie for accomodating a special request of preparing a carbonara off the menu for my aunt who is a slightly particular eater. Apart from that, the ambience was really good - lovely fairy lights and cool breeze made the quiet dinner very relaxing. For food, we ordered many items. But one thing I suggest is for the salted caramel Brioche dessert to be toned down in sweetness. The honeycomb can afford to be crushed into tinier pieces for sprinkling to avoid anyone from putting an entire piece in their mouth as it was mistaken for the brioche... It was hair-raisingly sweet!! And perhaps.. Bake the brioche a little less so it's not THAT crunchy, enabling it to soak up the goodness of the salted caramel and ice cream. Overall, good food. Only small small gripe is that.. It's a little pricey.But what can one say with the excellent quality, service and ambience given? (:
5
This place is amazing. The dishes are super tasty and actually cheaper than other brunch places in Singapore. The location is great, you really feel like you are out of the city. But the impressive thing was the service: extremely friendly and efficient, which is a nice change. Definitely the best overall
4
Visited Riders Cafe on 30/11/14 morning. It was very crowded, and reservation is full. I had to wait for about 1 hours. So I walk around the place to look at horses and took pictures first. Upon my turn, I ordered their famous Egg Benedicts( Blackstone Benedict & Pacific Benedict) Blackstone is with Bacon while Pacific is seafood. both of it is very delicious. And this place is very suitable for family gathering on a lazy Sunday. Will visit this place again
3
This is the place to go for if you like to have brunch in a "countryside" setting in Singapore. Location is quite deep in, you need to either drive or take a cab in.. occasion smell coming from the stables if you sit outdoors. Other than that, this place serves good brunch. Good place for catching up with friends. Try the Pacific Benedict .. Its yummy
2
The duck confirm taste horrible.
Pacific Benedict is fine.
Nothing much to see and the place is inaccessible without a car or taxi
4
ambiance is good, food is superb and the best part is you will not get any mosquito bites. Hope the aircon from the toilet is used in the dining area just in case it get hot and humid.
5
Nice and great ambience top by a very good service crew. Every dining experience is always great. Remember to make reservations before going to avoid disappointment.
5
Used to be an old equation club, but the remain the compound n turn it to recreation club where u can pick up horse riding classes. The rider's cafe located right at the place where they train the horses.its a good place to be
4
The food and service was very good. Pity the place isnt air conditioned but I would definitely come back to this place again.
5
I've always wanted to try out Riders Café after hearing raving reviews about it online and from friends. Finally I've had a chance to do so on a public holiday. What I love about the place: Food was great! At affordable prices too. And the Death By Chocolate Cake... OMG... It is one of the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Be warned: attempts to finish it on your own might result in a sore throat as the chocolate is soooo rich and soooo good. But it's worth the risk anyway.Atmosphere was good. I enjoyed watching horses prancing about the place and there might even be a chance to pet a horse. Having lived in the city all my life and being an animal lover, the sight of horses grazing on grass is definitely a welcome change to the scenery of tall grey buildings. The change in scenery sort of slows down my daily hectic pace to enjoy life a little more. I was not affected by any "animal smells" but I think this is pretty subjective to individual.Service was excellent. Staff was polite, friendly and intuitive to customers' needs. What was not so great:The location is very inaccessible. Without a car, it would be really hard to get to this place. Also didn't enjoy scraping the undercarriage on the crazy high road humps on the way towards the café carpark. So the road is not recommended for low cars.Overall: Definitely recommended. I will come back to visit the café again for sure. Also recommend to make reservations as the café can be pretty busy on public holidays and weekends

Riders Cafe was once my favourite breakfast/lunch haunt in Singapore but the food just isn't up to scratch these days. The fries are greasy and leave an aftertaste. The burgers are bland and undercooked (medium was decidedly rare) and the veggie options are disappointing too. A real shame as I LOVE the location and ambience.
4
We've been going here on and off for several years. It's still very good, although the menu doesn't change much, the service is hit-and-miss, and the drinks small and expensive. What makes it still worth going to is its quiet and secluded location in an old (no-aircon) colonial style building overlooking the stables and riding grounds of the Saddle Club. Grab a table on the balcony and get there before its dark to make the most of your visit
4
Brought my toddler along and he was seated with a view of the horses and greenery. Played at the playground and walked among the stables after the meal.Food was good too, reasonably priced with good quality.Service could be improved, but I went at a 'peak' brunch hour. Loved the brunch menu to be available till 3pm!  
3
Food was average but good service provided. Great ambience and I will recommend it as a chill out place. It gives people a relax feeling by the grassland by the restaurant and it reminds me of a overseas farm-trip restaurant up on the hills. Ambience and service is what made the trip enjoyable!
4
What is notable about this cafe is how well trained the members of the staff are.
They are responsive and motivated.
The brunch serving is generous and well presented.
3
Riders cafe is a good place for weekend brunch. Not too expensive compared to other brunch venues for a nice relaxing morning. I had fruit and yoghurt but others had eggs etc.
4
Great ambiance. Rustic but try and stay down wind. Must try their fabulous dessert - Death by Chocolate. Yummmmmy yum yum.
3
I booked a table for two as a treat for a friend celebrating her birthday. While she had her choice of scones for tea, much less could be said for me. I arrived early, shown to my table overlooking the Saddle Club. I was reminded that they were serving tea. No problems, that was what we were there for! Dying of heat and thirst, I ordered a citrus summer cooler, only to be told 1 minute later that, they were out of the citrus coolers. I changed my order to orange juice. Their blenders were out of order too so milkshakes were not available.While waiting for my friend, I decided to order a dessert. From their small dessert menu of scones, death by chocolate, lemon pousset, banana bread pudding, salted caramel brioche, I decided Death by Chocolate. The waiter took my order and a few seconds later, came back with news that they have also run out of chocolate cake! I looked carefully at the menu n saw a claim that all desserts were made in- house. So how could one run out of dessert items on a very trimmed dessert menu? Disappointing.The lemon pousset I ordered was ok, a little on the sweet side. What was not so satifactory was the quality of fruit on it. While the blueberries were fresh, the strawberries looked sad! The scones seemed ok.For the drive into the restaurant, the meal was unsatisfactory. I guess They will only be famous for their weekend brunch n not any other meal of the day
4
Came for dinner on a weekday so it's not crowded, thus service was good. We set at the verandah and it'll be ideal to arrive before the sun sets so you can see the beautiful surrounding & of course, the horse. Yup, natural air, no aircon! You want aircon, the toilet has blasting cold aircon!!Had cauliflower starter dish that's uniquely acceptable tasting. Mains were the Almighty Chicken & Halibut, which is "today's menu". Chicken serving was huge as they serve half chicken but the sauce is tasty. I prefer the halibut as the skin was the crispy type that I love and it's portion is just nice for small eaters. Dessert was the Death by Choc (layered choc cake & fudge with choc syrup poured over the cake with a scoop of ice cream), which is kinda rich/sweet for me, but the cake part is nice when ate along with ice cream.It's also nice to know they serve decaffeinated coffee, so you can have tasty coffee after a meal and still can sleep later on. For all these, spent $60/pax
3
We had dinner here. Ordered chicken tacos, and bruschetta as starters. They're fantastic, esp the chicken which is very tasty. I could just have eaten the starters and already feel full. Expectations were set high for the mains. Disappinted with the oyster roll. It's literally a few oysters on top of a roll, and with so much fries. The roll is tasty, but the fries is too overwhelming, I was having difficulty understanding how to eat the dish. Too much carbo on this dish. The riders cafe burger is ok but not memorable. But the risotto is good. We spent average 35sgd per person
3
Why oh why do chefs feel the need to put lettuce on a full breakfast? The Usual breakfast was just that usual or should I say forgettable. I asked for fried eggs which were cooked to death. The mushrooms were almost boiled and the sausage was anemic looking. I found the grilled tomato hiding under green leaf. A lump of bread on the plate on which to support the fried eggs. I'm not sure that there exists a restaurant in Singapore that does a decent full breakfast and if there is please let me know. All in all a great setting but very disappointing food and not cheap either. I did think id bring the grandparents there when they arrive in a couple of weeks, then the food came out and I changed my mind. Are we just accepting of mediocrity at extortionate prices??
3
Heard great reviews. Was excited. Truffle fries was fantastic. Risotto was not bad. Ordered medium-rare steak. Came medium to medium-well. We told waitress, waitress said she heard us order it was medium, not MR. Took it back to kitchen, came back, said she recalled incorrectly. We ordered MR, chef knew, & the steak was MR. I said no, I don't think so. She brought it back, re-did it. Came back later. Steak was MR. But. It was cold. Not refrigerator-cold, but definitely as least left out for a while, room temperature cold. Lastly, we arrived slightly past 11, was there till 1pm. Lastly. No milk was available for the whole period. Not the best for a cafe.

I have been wanting to visit Riders Cafe for a while, but somehow because of the inconvenience of the location and the lack of companion who actually wanted to travel all the way there, I waited patiently. My desire was fulfilled when Priscilla* agreed to go.This is an overview of the quaint little restaurant situated at the edge of bukit Timah area - a longhouse at the Bukit Timah Saddle Club. There is no air-conditioning for this dining haven - an indoors area with old-fashioned ceiling fans, elegantly-simplistic interior design and a verandah where we sat. The exquisite design of this place actually exuded a kind of old world charm yet at the same time, very comforting atmosphere, perfect for brunch with family or friends.Curious about its "delicious contemporary comfort food", we got the chore of ordering out of the way pretty fast. It was a pity we were a little late for brunch, so we chose from the a la carte menu instead.I had a Saffron Risotto & Seared Hokkaido Scallops with Baby Broccoli - a delicious rice dish cooked slowly with melted cream cheese sauce and very tasty, very succulent scallops that bounced into the mouth literally. The dish was delicious on its own, and even though they used saffron rice in place of arborio rice, the longer grains actually gave the dish a rather refreshing taste.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/12/lunch-at-riders-cafe.htm

Before you can come to their restaurant, You are REQUIRED to UNDERSTAND : 1. They have too much money to earn, their staff are Authorized NEVER pick up the phone during weekend. Even if their manager just standing there doing nothing, she will NEVER pick up the phone. Because as a customer,you are required to finish listening their answer machine message If you insist to call them, "Thank you for being so silly to call us, you MUST Make your reservation online! Go away if you want to make a reservation for THE SAME DAY because there is NO WAY to make a reservation at the same day." 2. You are expected to make a reservation online at least ONE MONTH in advance, because they will place "reserved" signs on every table and let the walk-in customer use the "reserved" table after one hour waiting. 3. You are expected to understand whatever Explanation that their manager gave you even if you had very very bad Customer Experience
4
Good place to chill with friends. Nice team of staff, attentive to needs of customers. Good food. Good ambience, no matter if its morning, noon or evening.
Try to make reservations! Otherwise it could be a long wait!!
4
The food at Riders for brunch was excellent. Great eggs, good breakfast taco, and to die for pastries. Only quibble is that the service could have been more attentive even though place was very busy.
4
Riders Cafe is one of the earlier brunch spots which was so popular that reservations have to be placed in advance. Fortunately and coincidentally, there was a table cancellation when I called on the previous day of visit and so we did not have much problems securing seats. The usual brunch suspects were delicious and certainly lived up to the predominantly positive comments that were aplenty in the media or online community. Brioche French Toast with Fresh Berries and Vanilla Mascarpone $14 are great for those who like to start the day on a sweet note. The alternative french toast option comes with maple butter, smoked bacon and burnt bananas. Unlike "The Usual" ($16), Black stone Benedict ($15) comes with the extra hollandaise sauce on poached eggs and crispy bacon instead of bangers and mushrooms.To me, hollandaise sauce is the supporting cast that makes the leading cast (soft poached eggs with bursting egg yolk) shine. I had been tempted all along to challenge the Death by Chocolate Cake with Vanilla Ice cream $12 but I was disillusioned eventually. This won by quantity and not quality. The chocolate ganache was not velvety and stood unmoving like a rubbery coating. There was not much contrast in the taste because everything from the cake to the ice cream was cloyingly sweet. Instead, the Salted Caramel Cheesecake with Crumbled Honeycomb $8 would attract one to take a second bite or even more. The cheesecake itself tasted as natural as it could get, without too much sugar added. Would be ideal if there is more of the salted caramel frosting. Special items of the day are written on the black board. Even though many other brunch spots and cafe have sprouted incessantly in Singapore, Riders Cafe is a good option for brunch or even dinner with the accompaniment of horses. But the location is only convenient if you can find your way there in a car or by a taxi. Visit blog under user's profile for full review and pics

This is a popular cafe - very hard to get in for weekend brunch. But I don't understand why. A breakfast order of 'eggs and bacon' was delivered as one side plate of eggs and one side plate of bacon and no toast. The subsequent toast order arrived 10 minutes later. A request for a childs meal of one egg and one piece of toast was greeted with 'sorry sir - you can only have two pieces of toast and two eggs'. Upon checking with the manager it was indeed confirmed that there was no flexibility possible - but if I really only wanted one egg and one piece of toast I could have them but would have to pay for two anyway. Really absurdly bad service. The ambience of the cafe is lovely - but its not the full package

Came in for brunch. Tried to make a reservation but it was full. The lady on the phone was nice enough to actually say try walking in usually there is a space. So i got in by 11 am this morning and sure enough there was a table available even though told her that i will wait for a bigger table while waiting for my wife to arrive. (we could have squeezed all 6 of us on the avail table) Unfortunately we ended up waiting half an hour for the next table. But all is good.There was lots of families but because it has a lot of open windows it was not noisy at all. The hosted offered to take our orders before the table was ready and sure enough the food came out like 10 min after we were seated. It was not all together but we don't mind.The salmon bagel was excellent. The smoked salmon was generous in portion.The Pacific Benedict was great. The today special which was the Pork belly (i don't remember how it was prepared) looked awesome but the sauce could have been stronger. I felt there was not enough kick.Breakfast Taco was actually surprisingly good. It was filled with scramble egg, chorizo, and potato and the spicy salsa was awesome!The decor is like the black and white houses that are preserved by the singapore government. I find it very nostalgic and a rare setting.In general everything came together real nice. The only thing that I was turned off with was the smell of horse manure as the restaurant is located in a horse stable complex. Your senses adjust after a while but it was the first thing I notice
4
Saw this place featured on TV and decided to pop by on a Sunday evening without a reservation thinking it was less busy. Thank goodness they had a table for us (this is a small place). As the name suggests, the restaurant is in the vicinity of the former races but some if its legacy remains. There is a stable less than 100m away, so you also get the "bonus" feel (and smell) of being at a farm. Our food arrived promptly. For the main, the scallop risotto was rich and delicious. To finish off the dinner, we had the Death by Chocolate, which is a cake drizzled by chocolate and served with an ice cream. It was a large portion and a massive over doze for us! Now I know how it got its name
3
This is not my first visit to the cafe for breakfast but it's a first on a weekend morning. The place was crowded. With no prior reservation, they gave us a tiny table (meant for 2) but we were still grateful. I ordered "the usual" and the omelette came the way I liked it. Until I dug into my salad! It was dirty and the tomatoes had sand in them!! Ugh.. But I didn't say anything till the end of the meal because I had a foreign guest with me. And they did offer me a drink to compensate me which I gently declined. So, service-wise, they're ok. Gotta be real careful with the cleaning of the foods tho! It would have been a very different review if I had food poisoning after that meal!! Haha!
4
This had once been a favourite place of mine especially for coffee and scones on weekends... then I stopped going for quite a while.. only to be a little 'disapointed' that it had since been 'discovered' and it was no longer easy to get a table unless you made a reservation, way in advance, and if one is happy to put up with a crowded (& noisy ) spot No... I am happy that Riders has become popular and enjoyed by many that throng the place now. I now visit on weekday evenings where it's more like old times - cosy and quiet wth more elbow roomFood is still good - both my friend and I had the crab pasta - it was done aglio olio style - the way I like it - the crab is fresh, and there were lots of it!Service is friendly and helpful which is appreciated
4
I'm almost loathe to write this review in case it stimulates too much interest and makes it harder to get a table. Have visited for lunch but this was my first dinner there. It is set amongst lush, green surroundings, it's secluded and quiet with horses clopping about but really not far out of town. I ordered the chickpea and chorizo soup and roast pork knuckle from the specials board. The soup was excellent and the pork knuckle was the best I've ever had, anywhere. Staff are attentive and whilst the menu is fairly limited, it's quality over quantity. A nice bottle of chardonnay finished it all off. It's on the return list and fairly near the top
4
We had brunch and was in time to try their famous eggs benedict breakfast set, as well as the roast chicken and bacon wrapped in pork. Freshly brew coffee for $3.00 we have no complain. They also serves warm water and the meal was delicious. We can see horses around the area and greenery all around but the place has no free wifi and was a bit warm when it reaches noon. The place is not Aircon, only fan and natural wind but the ambience is really warm n cosy which was a good place to chit chat and chill. :) food price was reasonable. :
4
Chicken salad was nicely presented with a tasty dressing. Squid was cooked just right. nice location as well near to the stables.
4
Great western style restaurant in the middle of a green lush parc near the horses stable.
Great setting and nice to eat in a collonial style away from the city. Do not expect a great entrance but the service and the food are good.
3
Review on Iron Lady the egg Benedict is good. Another disappointment. Wrong type of bread use . Hollandaise sauce too little. My bf try their Xmas set steak. The steak was cook just nice.
Cafe is warm. So please wear short shelves .
4
My third time to the Riders CafÃ© off Eng Neo Ave and I though it deserved a positive write-up. Tired of the usual fare along Orchard we thought we'd "brunch" somewhere different. What a pleasant experience! We had a lovely brunch Sat morning and although busy, the service was warm, fast and efficient. We had a full breakfast with coffee and a crabmeat brioche with a fruit smoothie; food and drink were exceptionally good - well prepared and served piping hot - thank you! Staff is friendly and competent - thank you again! Good value in a suburban setting of greenery and trees. Make a booking on weekends or go early. Worth returning
4
turned up without a reservation, and the hostess could not have been more helpful. we were seated and well looked after by efficient staff. the food was delicious - the corn polenta is highly recommended, as are the hush puppies. good deserts too! can't wait to come back. and the location with the horses and the jungle make it all dreamy
4
Love this place. The setting is lush, tropical and horsey. If you've ever wondered what it must have been like to live in one of the beautiful colonial black and whites, this gorgeous house will give you some idea. It's a great place for brunch with a terrific assortment of egg dishes burgers, salads, and other savory breakfast items. Staff members are cheerful, efficient and helpful. The two downsides are: it's impossible to get a reservation as they seem booked out well in advance (though try chope.com.sg - it's like a beta version of OpenTable for Singapore). As it's only accessible by car, if you rely on taxis, it's hard to get one to come out there to fetch you when you're done though there are usually people getting dropped off and you can snag one then
5
I am more often than not disappointed with restaurant experiences in Singapore.....especially if it involves a group of people. I went to Riders Cafe with a group of 15 women and it was a fantastic experience! The service was timely and attentive. I had the fish of the day with artichoke puree and it was incredible. Ladies who ordered the lamb and grilled chicken salad were raving about their food as well.The only downside....and it was my own ignorance....I didn't realize it was an open air restaurant so I was a bit warm in what I was wearing
4
We went on a Thursday night with a baby in a car seat which we sat on one of the chairs. It was lovely and quiet. There were a few other tables occupied. We sat on the verandah (no booking) which overlooks the Saddle Club, though you can't see it in the evening. I had steak which was pretty good (not excellent but still good). The chocolate cake was AMAZING and huge! My husband had burger and fries. I would describe it as casual and well prepared basic food, nothing too fancy.The waiter was lovely and no problem taking the baby. There are stairs so it is not stroller friendly but you could easily carry the stroller up the one set of stairs. There was no air conditioning but with the windows open on either side there was a great breeze and it was nice to sit outside. Next to the building is a children's playground so you could watch the kids from that side during the day I imagine.Definitely need to catch a taxi or drive. But if you are driving there is plenty of parking and it is free
1
I reserved a table over the phone some hours in advance, when we arrived no reservation was found. Anyway, a week later they called and confirmed the reservation (!). The Seafood Cioppino is a total disaster which obviously is some reheated stuff hence the few shrimps inside are like Michelins meaning not the stars but the tires. The crab contained nothing. The waiters are apparently brain dead. No questions asked about anything, just took the orders, dumped the food on the table, and after a lot of waiving one came and got my credit card. Again not a single question asked. No, I did not tip them since I will not be back
4
We made reservations 1.5weeks before.We were there with our kids and they were kept ebtertained by the sight of the horses.Ordered the egg Benedict and French toast for the kids but they didn't seem to like it. The place has no Aircon so on a hot and humid day it may not be the best place for breakfast. Pricewise I thought was on the high side given that it's not even located in town.May go back again if I run out of options for breakfast
4
Loved this place, one of the cheaper options for Singapore most items around $10/12 which is incredible by comparison, I loved the setting really nice dining room, very relaxed. A great option for Sunday brunch.
4
You can do horse watching at this place while you enjoy your meal!
May be a good idea to reserve a table as this place is really popular.
5
The journey to this place is rather far as we drove all the way from Changi (nevertheless, it's worth it). Reservations for weekends will be taken on weekdays (only). It's better to make a reservation if there are more than 4 people in the group. This is a good place to chill, relax & casual dressing (be casual as the only place with air-conditioning is the bathroom). The Blackstone benedict is yummy!! I would have ordered the steak (Steak Frites of Angus Rib-Eye, CafÃ© de Paris Butter & Seasoned Fries) if not for my sore throat. Another item that caught my eyes were the Butterscotch & Chocolate Pudding with Bananas & Fleur de Sel. I will definitely try this next time. Overall, food is good, the portion is right & service is fast & friendly. Oh, and there will be unpleasant smell now & then (when the wind blows) because the place is not enclosed nor air conditioned
4
My favourite place for a slow pricey breakfast with my spouse. It is reachable only by car, but once you're there you would find it hard to tell if you were in Margaret River or Singapore. :-) Worth your while to check it out. Food is pretty good and the latte is good. Menu spread is a little limited compared to competitors though. If you're there early in the day or when the weather is not so sunny, seating on the verandah is very pleasant and gives a lovely view of the stables and greenery.I've never tried this place at lunch / dinner. I never had to make reservations for breakfast on weekdays. A must try
4
Location a bit of a hike from town, but well worth it. Great to look out and not see high rise condos as far as the eye can see. It's lovely, quiet and relaxing, surrounded by riding tracks and jungle.Food decent. I have been there several times for brunch during the week and weekends, and have always had the Blackstone Benedict with Bacon & Tomatoes, Poached Eggs & Hollandaise. For this dish out of 10, I would never give it less than a 6, but sometimes if you're lucky you'll get a 9! We keep going back for the ambience and location
3
This is one of the hottest places in Singapore for a weekend brunch,apparently being booked up months in advance for an event that ends at3.15 p.m. after which the staff seem to feel entitled to coast throughthe rest of the day if my experience last week was anything to go by.We received a 3.15 p.m. slot with no warning that the brunch endedthen and after that the restaurant would serve only five starters anda sparse selection of desserts under the sobriquet "High Tea". Nor dotheir online PDF menus point this out, listing mains as beingavailable from 11 a.m. until last orders. Anyway when we got there wedecided it was too much bother to go looking for another place, so wemade the best of it. Which wasn't much.First of all my (supposedly hot) capuccino arrived cold -- I put myfinger in it to demonstrate to the staff how lacking in heat it was.Things went downhill from there. The scones were just bready enoughand not too biscuity that they lived up to their billing. Thebruschetta was fresh and flavourful but a bit too simple to justifyall the raving about this place I heard from my friends. The chickenskewer thingy was satisfactorily charred, but the softshell crab wastoo oily for words.Even the pots of tea were able to offend, somehow contriving to yieldup just one-and-a-half cups each rather than the two it has been myexperience to receive at most places. Throughout the meal the staffcongregated at the servery table and chatted desultorily. Still it waspleasant to sit there and read the papers and watch the horses beingput through their paces, so that by the time we left we had apleasantly lazy weekend feeling. Overall I suppose this place is allright if you're one of those ladies who lunch (we saw and heardseveral squealing and giggling intemperately at each other) but forthe rest of us I wonder if Riders' Cafe hasn't begun to coast on itsreputation

Went there with two of my pals for brunch and we felt super welcomed by the manager, who ensured our seats were okay since we didn't make any reservations. It was pretty crowded that morning too. Fries were delicious, and so was the Blackstone Benedict though I thought the bread was too tough. It may have been easier to eat if there was one piece of bread for each egg. Coffee was superb, and it was quite cooling even with the sweltering sun and just ceiling fans. It was another kind of view just looking into the stables and see horses. Felt like I was overseas, so not Singapore! Would recommend you to make reservations first to reduce the amount I time spent on waiting. Free carpark though not many lots.

We frequently go to the Green Fairways driving range and eat dinner at the Chinese restaurant there. This week is was closed, so we finally went to Riders Cafe. What a wonderful place. We sat on the balcony overlooking the stables on a very nice evening. The service was very good and prompt and the meal was delicious. I had the grilled salmon, my husband had the pasta with crabmeat. Both were very good. It's a bit pricey, but the ambiance is worth it. Great place for a special evening out

Every time we drive into the narrow road leading to the Saddle Club it gives me the feeling that I am transported to another world. The lush green, the wooden fence and rain forest greets us with open arm.Dining at the Rider's Cafe has always been pleasant. Good service and great food. Most impressed is the setting that is very homely with open balcony over looking the greens and stable with horses. Don't expect cheap brunch for the quality. Serving is decent using fresh ingredient. 2 mains with a drink each knocks us back $60+ than again who's complaining for the scenery and great food? The only down side is early reservation to ensure you get a table. Otherwise waiting time can be between 20-45 minutes depending on the time. Between brunch and lunch is the longest wait. Book a day earlier as they don't take same day reservation esp. on bank holidays. If you have never tried Rider's Cafe, time for a quick visit. You won't be disappointed! PS: They are child friendly too!

If you want a weekend brunch the way the locals do it - this is it. I went here with a friend who lives in Singapore - great find tucked away in the 'countryside'. This is actually a private equestrian club, but this restaurant is open to the public. Excellent breakfast selection, poached eggs, scrambled, etc. I had the vegetarian breakfast selection, which had polenta, and was done perfectly! Relaxed setting in a verandah style. They take bookings - so call ahead to guarantee a table. Parking available, and keep an eye out for couples taking their wedding photos on the lawn, and pony rides for the kids.

Service was sloppy, food was bad, scorching hot, poor value for money, a maze to get to. Just not worth the effort, go somewhere else.

Totally love this place. Cozy hide-out away from the city & crowd. Always go there in the afternoon for their homemade cakes. Sit on the balcony to have a great view of horses and lush greenery surroundings.

the lack of air-conditioning definitely did not aid in the 36 degree heat, with whiffs of horse dung in the air.

We visited Singapore on CNY weekend and added Riders Cafe to our itinerary. What a Great Place! It reminded us of our Louisville home with the nearby paddock easily visible from the Cafe. Horses and riders regularly paraded to and from the nearby stable. We were able to watch a trainer work her horse out in a fenced area. The meal was excellent. The Sunday drink specials were good - especially the bloody mary (watch out for the spice on this one!). We will tell our friends of this place as a good local hideaway for good food

Lovely place to have breakfast with friends and though its a tad out of the way, the rustic atmosphere and the horses make it worth the effort. They had a variety of breakfast sets to choose from. Ordered the soft-shell crab benedict and it was a twist from the usual benedict, but it got a bit too oily after a while. Had their chocolatey mud cake and it was REALLY chocolatey, dont attempt to eat this all alone. Great service as they kept refilling our water, try to ask for a window seat for a better vie

Our phone number is one digit away from Riders. We have called them many times to work out a solution because my wife suffers from severe migraine headaches and 90% of our calls are for Riders reservations. When my wife is having an attack and the phone keeps ringing not for us but for Riders it causes her a LOT of distress.We suggested they get a second number for reservations and use that on their website. Then, over time as they print new business cards and flyers they break in the new number while keeping the old number so patrons who have stored the old number can still get through so they would not lose ANY business.We thought this was more than fair and reasonable. The person we spoke to was a guy called Ian and he rejected our proposal saying "a telephone number is important to a business" ???? Sure, but there are plenty of numbers ! What about my wife's health ?He said he would have to discuss it with his boss but I thought he WAS the boss as I asked to speak to the boss when I called and he said he was the boss. When I found out he was not the boss, I asked to speak to the boss or have the boss call me. He flatly refused to allow me to speak to him or have them call me. A Singtel person on the 3-way call can verify all this.Any company that is so cruel, coldhearted and incompassionate so as to refuse to get a second number for reservations and perpetuate my wife's suffering (we did NOT ask them to give up their current number) is not worth eating at in my humble opinion.Please support us and do not give them your patronage.God Bles

The price is shocking. When you see the food, it shocks you even further. When you taste the food it makes you feel like punching yourself to waste your hard earn money. My first time here at end of march will be my last time here. The risotto looks pathetic, over priced and over cooked scallops. The brocollini looks rancid. The lamb rack is a joke. And a terrible one to

http://thechosenglutton.wordpress.com/2010/10/02/literally-riders-cafe/A happy occasion should, without fail, be accompanied by good food, and dearest people. Happy occasion – passing out from BMT – check; Dearest people – my family – check; Good food – we took a gamble at Riders Cafe – check.It was a spot-on day to get to Riders Cafe. Like how people like to visit countries during autumn, I’d think most would prefer visiting this kind of non-air-conditioned cafe on a windy, just-before-it-rains kind of day. Just when you thought it couldn’t get better, it does. We were, fortunately, assigned a balcony seat. There, not only can you feel the waves of breeze better, you can see black, brown, white horses taking a stroll around the area just diagonally below you. I felt like I was teleported to a countryside in a far far away country where no men live. It was calming with the ambience and setting, not to mention, I love how horses look so cute even with their build.To compliment the soothing environment you’d have gotten upon stepping into the cafe, the service crew was really approachable and hospitable. It somehow makes you fit in more (I say that because, most of the people dining there are either rich families, at least they look like they are, or they live around that area and are frequents). Now let’s shift the spotlight to the main point – food.Bacon & Tomato (With Poached Eggs On Sourdough) ($14.00++) :: I didn’t try this – my dad did. He said that the eggs are pretty good. But from what I see, it isn’t worth the money. There are only, well, bacon, tomato, sourdough and eggs. lol. Bacon’s overly crispy, and you can only taste the butter somewhere in the middle of the sourdough. The sides are hard.‘The Usual’ ($16.00++) :: This set of breakfast includes, well, the usual. lol. Crispy/Smoked bacon, poached/fried/scrambled egg, banger (sausage), basil tomato, mushroom, and sourdough. Basically, more or less the good ol’ English breakfast. The scrambled egg, for me, is better than most that I’ve tried, although it really isn’t very good, even. The bacon, once again, disappoints. Nothing, so far, matches up to that of Sydney, Australia’s well-cooked streaks of bacon. Over here, it is way too crispy/hard, and, eeky. The banger was pretty average. The only item that is excellent is the basil tomato. It’s the best I’ve had. Mushroom is a little below average (if you’re the kind who goes for the raw taste and smell of mushroom, then this might fail you a little). With that, you can infer that it’s, once more, not value for money.Hot Chocolate ($3.50++) :: When I saw that it only costs the above stated price, I ordered it without a second thought. lol. And the relatively lower-priced hot chocolate doesn’t mean that the standard is compromised. Because that didn’t happen. It actually tastes fine, topped with small cubes of marshmallows. Definitely acceptable.Chamomile Flowers Tea ($5.50++) :: My mum got herself the Chamomile Flowers Tea. I tried it, and I must say it smells and tastes really refreshing. It’s pleasant-smelling. But I really don’t know about tea. Its presentation is really good though. lol.I’d have rated this 1 star (✰) instead of 2 (✰✰) (out of 3) if not for its setting and surrounding. The horses. The countryside setting (oh – a couple was having their wedding photos taken while we were there). It’s a really different experience – worth trying just once. Bring a book along too, maybe, if you have the time.—> NOTE #1: If you are not driving there, don’t try going in with public transport (except cabs). I don’t remember seeing any bus stops nearby – plus, you’d have to walk quite a distance deep into Fairways Drive.—> NOTE #2: Make a reservation before you go! We almost had to wait a long time for our table. You can maybe request for balcony seating too (if you’d like to see horse trotting around while you’re enjoying your meal).—> NOTE #3: Payment is made at your table – you don’t have to go to the counter for that, even though the cafe looks like they utilize the self-service payment-at-the-counter system

If you ask me if there's anything I not like about Riders Cafe - the answer would be 'NO'.Honestly, what's there not to like about the place? It is housed in an old building with character; the location is away from the hustle and bustle of city living; there's lots of fresh air with the occasional whiff of nature (yes, there are horses around); the menu offers some really fantastic stuff to boot; and the service staff are young and friendly.I highly recommend this place for courting couples who wish to try something different. Best to avoid weekends as it can get rather busy and, of course, crowded. Yet you don't get the feeling that the service staff are rushing you through your meal.The food is great - just see for yourselves from the photos attached.For a romantic experience, reserve seats on the balcony
