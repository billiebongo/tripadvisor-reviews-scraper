The renovated Rose Veranda retains the cosy and relaxing mood for a great afternoon tea. Marvellous place for a gathering with friends, chatting the afternoon away !

Dec is the Christmas theme meals. Prefers usual days menu where there are more pastry option.
Atmosphere is perfect. Cosy place.

With the most extensive tea selection of TWG teas, you will go crazy choosing! So many desserts, it might be a challenge to go through them all, but they all taste so good! They have all sorts of cakes, pastries, fondue, fruit, pudding, cookies, biscuits, cupcakes, muffins... And they also have a savory selection which changes. I remember they had sushi, curry, noodles, fried rice, roasted vegetable medley... The cutlery they use are also very beautiful. Highly recommended for a great time with your friends and your family

Great place to gather with a few of your friends for high tea and catch-up moments. Food spread while limited (due to the reason it's meant for high tea, not proper lunch), was good enough to fill up your tummy. Not forgetting that it comes with a pot of TWG tea, and also choices of coffee as well

The ambience is lovely if you are looking for a place to chit chat and unwind . Great attentive service. If you are looking to have a hearty meal, you would be disappointed. We were there on a weekday and the food was not replenish timely. Laksa gravy was not hot enough. The dim sum is unappetizing and limited selection of dishes. Certainly not worth the price! Go there only if you are interested in having a cup of tea... great selection

Tis a lot nicer to have lunch or tea with a close Friend .. so you can indulge in “rose verandah’s” wonderful buffet ... the staff is attentive in a nice quiet sort of way .. without much tedious niceties of chatter .. we prefer it this way so that we can concentrate on all the different flavors of food .. they are absolutely generous with tea TOP ups and since I had a cold .. honey and lemon with hot water was my request .. both of us enjoyed Thoroughly we were there from 12 till 2 pm .. it was a treat ...

Was better in the past, with a wider selection of food which included smoked salmon. The salmon sashimi was served sparingly (although it was quickly replenished) which resulted in my having to wait there on 2 occasions for the chef to top up. Still, it was an enjoyable meal. Not sure if I'd return, as aside from the ambience, the food's nothing much to shout about.
5
We were greeted politely and shown to our table promptly. The service was great. The staff was constantly clearing empty plates and refilling our tea. The food was well spread out, with food items laid out in different counters. The cheese counter is worth checking out. We like the desserts spread too as it took on a Christmas feel.My compliments to all the staff of The Rose Veranda

We were greeted most hospitably at the entrance of the outlet and shown to our table promptly. As it offers seatings, the outlet did not seem overcrowded at any point in time. The food was well spread out, with food items laid out in 4-5 counters. I went straight for the cheese counter, with its variety of cheeses; definitely well worth checking out. As the meal period was high tea, the food items came in bite-sizes and consisted mostly of sandwiches, Chinese dianxin, savouries, pastries and as it was the Christmas season, the turkey. Desserts took on a Christmas feel too. The service was spot-on, with the wait staff constantly clearly empty plates and refilling our tea pots. They did a fantastic job in explaining their range of tea blends and coffee variations and took care to mention which beverage carried additional charges when we sat down at our table. I like this clarity and all the patrons seem at ease. Well done, The Rose Veranda

Booked a special afternoon tea here for my family visiting from the UK as we'd all been before and loved the elegant atmosphere and delicious food..Not sure what has happened or if we were just unlucky but today's visit wasn;t as we'd hoped for at all.The staff were attentive and lovely but their poor understanding of requests meant we had to ask several times and several people to get items.Many stations were mostly empty and the chefs/staff simply seemed overwhelmed by the demand (even though it wasn't full or that busy) and many items ran out quite early on..the sushi looked tragic and definitely not as good as we'd remembered. Just a few slices of salmon sashimi and four or five half full small plates of mostly rice with a sliver of fish or egg. The turkey was dry and the young lady slicing it ended up serving tiny bobbles of meat as her knife/knife skills were lacking. The beef was overcooked.Overall, despite the lovely surroundings and staff who tried their best, we just felt it was an overpriced, tired experience and won't be back until the Shangri La reverts to it's former glory

Lovely ambience :) A great spread of food. The desserts were delectable, varying from cakes to kueh. Just a nice afternoon with lovely company over a lovely and elegant high tea.
5
Delicioso dishes, amazing ambience, personal favourite were the scrumptious desserts and self-serve hot chocolate
4
Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. Nice ambiance and attentive service. Very thoughtful to have provided a birthday cake as well.
One comment is to increase the variation of sashmi. There was only salmon although it states assorted sashimi.
5
Everything was good. Excellent service, cost and comfortable place for catch-ups. Food was alright, would have expected more pastries for afternoon tea but that’s just a personal opinion.
5
Good service from the lovely team. We also added on the 3-hr unlimited free flow of wine. However, the food was cleared off the buffet table too early and without first notifying us, so I totally missed the dessert buffet! A pity!
5
Celebrated my birthday here. The high tea is a serious affair. Never had roast beef so tender! The tea choices are also very unique.There's a good range of cakes. Furthermore, they're not huge so one could try everything. Compliments to the staff! The service was excellent
3
Went for the Christmas afternoon tea buffet here, the service was excellent however the cakes were not very good and the menu online stated that there would be beef wellington which I was really looking forward to however there was no beef wellington and instead there was salmon. The savoury food was ok however at the start of the buffet it was mostly leftovers from the 1st sitting

I was out of town and not back till early this week. I made a reservation online at The Rose Veranda Shangrila on 28 Nov 1.30pm slot before I left for my year end travel. I did not receive any call informing me of the error on their online booking. The customer service officer did not even apologise for their error and claimed that I would have received an email on the change of timing for Christmas season. I only noticed the change when I find it strange not to receive any confirmation prior to my booking. That is when I was informed that my booking was changed to an earlier slot ie 11.30am (I was told that the latter timeslot at 3pm was fully booked)Totally disappointed in the way they managed the booking. Why does it take them so long to notice and inform guests! My plan with my friends was totally screwed. (To those whom I have spoken, how would I know that every year there is special seating during Christmas season. Pls do not assume that your guest should have know it).
5
A nice place for friends and family to have their gathering. We are here to celebrate 5 ladies's birthday and everyone are happy with the ambience and food especially the tea. There was quite a variety of tea and coffee for selection and each can choose a coffee & a tea. Attentive service from the staff too...
5
i enjoy this high tea since more than 10 years. It is still my prefered one.The food is excellent. The choice is impressive for a high tea.The staff is always perfect: very efficient but not invasive.The place is clear, quiet and cosy. you can choose between pool or garden view.if you want to try one, try this one.do not forget to book not to be diappointed on arriva
5
Quality over quantity high tea. A cosy setting that is perfect for a catch up with friends. Attentive service from staff.
4
Celebrated niece's birthday and everyone happy with ambiance and food, and especially the tea. Always hapoy with a good cup of Gryphon tea. Good discount to have booked online as well as good price for kids too. Thumbs up !!
3
A nice place for friends and family to have their gathering. they serve really nice scones and their staffs are very friendly.
4
We came here at around 1:30pm, and sat through all the way until 5pm. The food variety is good. We expected only cakes and desserts but The Rose Veranda also served decent dishes, eg. lamb, beef, chicken, pork ribs, vegetarian lasagna, seafood stew, dim sum, laksa, really good sushi and sashimi, etc. We were pleasantly surprised by that. And of cos, we enjoyed the desserts. And the chocolate drinks counter. The Rose Veranda serves Gryphon Tea. I would think that the Zesta Connoisseur Collection which they collaborated with Shangrila Malaysia is a much better choice. But this is purely a personal taste. The restaurant can be quite full even on a weekday afternoon. The noise level very much depends on the other guests. But overall the service, atmosphere and ambiance are nice

On 28th August I took a close friend, Shaik Shidek for Hi Tea at Rose Veranda, Shangri la. I was so proud that the hostess, Tristar straight away recognised me as a return guest, She was excited to meet me again, my earlier visits being in July when my family celebrated my birthday. Though the spread of food was buffet, Tristar served us the Laksa, altogether two servings. She came back to several times to my table to make sure that me and my guest were comfortable, she also cleared away the crockeries very frequently and replace with new ones. What did me proud was that she took care of Shaik's needs very well as he had allergies to some food, especially when she prepared his Laksa she made very sure there were no prawns and cuttle fish were in his bowl and also kept the :blachang away from him. Shaik was so touched by Tristar's care and concern.We enjoyed the spread of food very much, the choice was plenty and delicious. When we came to the dessert corner we wee thrilled that we could make our own chocolate drink and picking our own choice of chocolates, both white and black.We left with our stomach full to the brim and Shaik told me that he will definitely come back again, this time with his friends. I truly love the food and the ambience; to top it all up, even the crockeries live up to its name, Rose Veranda because each utensil had roses on it and even the napkins had a rose embroidered on it
4
Our first visit after their renovation. The tea selections changed; not as many to choose from but it was ok.. the high-tea buffet was still good. As usual, they have their laksa there. The bowl for laksa has shrunk considerably making it quite difficult to manage yourself a bowl. The small bowls are really cute tho. Laksa wasn't as good as I remembered it. I remember we could help ourselves with 2 bowls but this time I couldn't finish that one bowl I had. Overall, always pleased with the service and high tea selections at Rose Veranda because it's not the same as the others where they have those tiered trays with mini sandwiches. The complimentary 3-hours parking was great!
5
Was quite crowded during the Hi tea session. There was quite a variety of tea and coffee for selection and can choose up to 2 Flavours. The food variety spread consists of dim sum, hot dishes, laksa, sashimi, western finger food- salads, sandwiches. The dessert stand has different types of cakes and macaroons too. A great spread for hi tea.
5
Rose Veranda is our all time favourite of family gathering. Atmosphere, services, food quality and tea selections are excellent. They no longer served TWG but Gryphon after resuming business due to 6 months of renovation in other areas of hotel properties; nevertheless it's still good tea with high service standard Food selections definitely can't compare with buffets but one of best for high tea in town. Shangri la reward card members no longer enjoy discounts, however we will still continue to be it's loyal customers ☺️ Highly recommend for family gathering with infants as it's child friendly environment including not only the service crews but most of guests we met so far for many years in the past.
5
This restaurant is situated on the mezzanine level of the Shangri-la. Buffet style with fresh sushi, soups, hot an cold selections, and a chocolate bar. Staff are wonderful, service is excellent, and you can sit and chat the afternoon away while drinking beautiful teas (or wines). A very pleasant way to wile away an afternoon
4
We went there at 11.30am which is as good as lunch.There is a wide variety of food and their dishes suit all ages. There are roast beef, salmon n tuna sashimi, salad, cooked food, laksa and different types of pastries. The choices of tea is very extensive. Chef Jason really knows what is best for the customer as there is a well balance of dishes.The service and hospitality is warm, sincere and friend. The staff leads by Sandy give us a pleasant and enjoyable time. The staff are well trained and very professional, they will clear the plates once you had finished and when you returned from second serving, the table is cleaned and not occupied by empty used plates. The ambience is cozy and the views is nice. I will definitely come back with my friends again
2
I have been going to Rose Veranda every year but ever since the renovation, everything has just deteriorated. Food is so-so, selection is limited. There is no more TWG tea. Definitely not worth paying the kind of money for the food selection. Utter disappointment.
5
The ambience & service is wonderful! Food selection is good. We totally enjoyed ourselves and will come back for more!
4
More like a buffet than a high tea but it is very good quality. The selection of tea and dessert is outstanding. We visit this place whenever we are in Singapore.

I was impressed with the service level rendered by these two team members, Bennie (bellman) and Trista (from The Rose Veranda).My Uber driver had dropped me off at the Valley Wing, after having driven pass the main lobby. I alighted and tried to find my way there. Deciding to find a place to sit down to call my guest, Bennie came forward to ask me where I was intending to go. When I told him I had a reservation at The Rose Veranda, he offered to walk me to the lobby near the restaurant. Well done, Bennie, for going the extra mile. In the restaurant, Trista attended to us. I told Trista I had dietary preferences and restrictions. When I mentioned the food items I could take, Trista made it a point to communicate with the chefs and brought me those food items. Thank you, Trista; for the service attention.
5
My last visit to the Rose Veranda was almost 20 years ago. Nowadays, it’s certainly more popular and less intimate, but the place has preserved dignity – it’s not overrun by tour groups like many other high teas. There is a wide variety of food for all ages, both Asian and Western favourites. While this is a leisurely meal, it pays off to have a look at dessert offerings quite early: Some items were very popular and they were not replenished. Service was friendly, attentive and professional. The discount from an online promotion was deducted with no reminder necessary. Book early – weekends in particular are typically fully booked about two weeks ahead of time
5
The food and ambience cannot be faulted. The salmon carvery with dill sauce was my favorite. Fabulous selection of dessert spread both western and local. Limited sushi selection but the cold meats and cheeses were plentiful. The dim sums and signature laksa will surely delight locals and tourists alike
4
Although the spread is not very big but the choices were good. They had a few cheese selection, salad, sashimi, hot and cold section with Parma ham and foie gras were excellent. Their signature dish is the laksa which is not to be missed. The tea selection was from Gryphon and lots to choose from. It's about sgd50++ per pax. It has a relaxing ambience and not overly crowded or noisy. Good choice for a Sunday high tea.

Rose Veranda is my fav place for High-End Afternoon Tea. I got a wine for free as they have just re-opened after a period of renovation. There is a wide variety of food and their dishes are consistently good. There are roast beef, salad, sashimi, cooked dishes , dessert, hot coffee, and laksa. My Favourite is salmon salad and laksa. The choices of coffee and tea are extensive. The Afternoon Teas starts at 11.30am and it is as good as lunch . The service and hospitality is warm, sincere and friendly . The staff are really there to serve and let customers have a pleasant and enjoyable time. The staff are very well- trained, very professional.The ambience is cozy and the setting is modern and classy. They also gave me a complementary carpark coupon. That is a great saving for me. If you want to enjoy Afternoon Tea and wish to give yourself a special treat, go to Rose Veranda !

This Rose has wilted, withered and died and is finally compost.After a failed attempt at a semi-refurbishment, the Rose Veranda has finally died from neglect. The same worn, scuffed chairs are there, with barely a clean. The same dirty carpets withyesterday’s food scraps, dust and neglect evident in every corner. The same under-staffing with severely disengaged, poorly managed and thoroughly incompetent staff. They seem more interested in chatting with their colleagues from another outlet than getting orders correct, or knowing basic things about the menu. A simple observation of the lazy, lacklustre pseudo-supervisor gives you all the answers you need.The food is tollerable – nothing special or interesting for SGD61 per person.Shameful neglect of this once decent place and yet another missed opportunity to turn the place around from is long-standing terminial descent.What a disgrace, Shangri-La

We have visited The Rose Veranda last Saturday 27 May 2017 after they reopened on 16 May 2017 due to the refurbishment. The Rose Veranda is always our choice of afternoon tea to go. However, after their recent refurbished, I personally find that their food selections are not as fantastic compared to our past visits. They used to have tea selection from TWG, and now they have changed to another brand of tea which the tea doesn't taste as good. We even need to top-up a $5.00 for the tea we selected. The price of their afternoon tea has increased, I would expect they have also upgraded their food to be much better. I would say the price increased might be for their good service (the staffs have been doing a very good job and providing tip top service ever since our first visit). I hope they will constantly change their food selection occasionally. I hope to see some improvement during my next visit

Best place for a buffet high tea. Fantastic selection and very attentive staff. The food is excellent.
4
The ambiance is conducive for good chat up with friends. The food was delicious and there was a wide variety to choose from. The servers were attentive to our needs and accommodated to our wants. Our overall, experience was quite good.
5
Food and service were excellent, just as one would expect of a Shangri-la Singapore. Smaller buffet than The Line but you walk out of the Verandah instead of rolling out of The Line.
5
Excellent service, gorgeous tableware and huge buffet variety featuring Asian and Western selections. Great for family gatherings or catching up with friends
3
Had the weekday afternoon buffet. The spread for the desserts were quite extensive. The mains were decent. The place was quiet and good for catching up. However, I felt the tables were a little too low for comfort.
5
Desserts selection is sufficient and not too sweet. Just nice. Wide selection of teas and the chef is very friendly.
5
Loved the service and spread of desserts (especially the chouchou). The cod and beef wellington were also delicious. We were there for the second seating and were full for the rest of the night. Service was impeccable, staff were all very friendly and knowledgeable about the teas available. Had a great time
4
My favourite part of this afternoon tea is the long hours from 11.30am to 6pm! Cosy lounge to chill and enjoy the tea and food. Quality of food is good and quite consistent. Service staff are attentive. Lotsa natural lights make it a good place to read and just chillax.

I was an avid fan of Rose Vernada's high tea. It was almost a monthly weekend event 2 years back. During then, I still remembered a cheerful female Indian manger who manages my every request. Things changed, especially when I compared them to the my past experience. Even the sushi were bad. Lakes gravy was no longer flavorful. Even the fried chicken wings were tasteless. Service was slow, staff were expressionless (it is like they hated their job), and the only time they were quick was at around 215 pm when they were clearing out the 1st batch of diners. (Weekend high tea is split into 2 batch, 12 - 230 and 3 to 530).I do like the durian cake, ice cream and some selected dessert. Honestly, this much raved about high tea venue is just tired, boring and simply put, quite a waste of time
4
Having been to. Many high tea events in Europe , this is a treat.you can arrive at 11:30 and leave at 6 pm. A nice range of oriental and European snacks and an extensive dessert menu .A place to entertain and be entertained with foo

Service staff is wonderful and the ambience is tranquil. Great place to chillax with a bunch of close friends or special other.

Rose Veranda never fails to deliver the best afternoon high tea. I spent a lovely Monday with my parents enjoying lunch cum high tea from 11.30-4.30pm . Would have been nice to sit till 6pm .. Regretfully due to another appointment I had, I had to leave at 4.30pm. I understand that on Friday's now Rose Veranda has 2 settings just like for weekends from 11.30am -2.30 pm and 3pm - 6pm. Booking online save you a 15% discount. What I love about Rose Veranda is that extra mile the Chef goes . I have highlighted my allergy with peanuts and they made my Thais Salad separately.!They even emailed me the menu so that I could call 1 day earlier to inform the dishes that I would like to have without nuts. Chef Khoo was so nice , he walked me round the Buffett line and shared with me dishes that had nut ingredients and to avoid it. I really appreciate his kind gesture. For August this month they had a new menu. The beef rendang was perfect . Tender and taste was just right. The dessert section was also yummy. Always loved the Vanilla Cream Brulee. The carving station was good too. Now that they even added a pasta station.Many thanks to the following staff whom always took care of us when we are there:Chef Perry and Chef Khoo,Eileen, Sasi and Jenny. Keep up the Good work and thanks for making our Afternoon High Tea an enjoyable and relaxing place to be in. Will be coming back soon

1. The last time I was there, all diners were offered 2 choices of unlimited supply of tea (which wasn't fantastic to start with), however Rose Veranda now changed their policy instead only allowing each guest 1 selection of tea and to enjoy a wider range diners had to top up $12 per table. 2. Food selection was bad, real bad and the quality was poor. To be honest the only dish that tasted reasonable was the salmon sashimi (no skill involved as no cooking required) and the laksa. (Laksa is cheap anyway). The rest of the dishes were horrible.3. Most of their food were cheap, the ones that were not so cheap were poorly executed. Cheap food: chicken wings, nachos, crackers, lousy dim sum, lousy fried noodles, corn, lousy sandwiches, cheapo salads, cakes that didn't taste much. More expensive food with poor execution: Overcooked salmon, dry and soggy beef wellington, lousy soup which I noticed no one taking (some mix grain soup) who drinks that
5
Lovely quiet, comfortable lunch with a nice change in the availability of a salad and roast meat and vegs.The service first class and buffet offered something for everyone with a delicious dessert showcase, with huge selection of teas and coffee a great place for lunch
4
2 adults and two children. Loved the spacious and leafy setting! More selection than expected for a high tea, which meant the kids had some savoury food before their multiple visits to the extensive dessert area. The roast section is easily bypassed but the lamb chops were divine said my 11 year old. Huge TWG tea selection, only one juice each for the kids but we also had iced water so no issues. Service was a bit patchy and slow, but it was a busy day and we were in no rush. I would recommend for a long lazy lunch

Having been a regular at Rose Veranda for more than a decade, it’s sad to see the extent of the decline and management’s acceptance of the low standards as a norm. Sitting down on a chair that still had crumbs from the previous session doesn’t get the experience off to a good start. Having to wipe the greasy table top isn’t something I expect. Finding not a single (!) staff member on the floor for the first 20 minutes of service fully validates the compost to which this dying rose is doomed.One staff member, Eileen, tried to get the service back on track, but with every table in a nearly full sitting experiencing the same issues, it was not something that could be turned around with a smile and an apology. There appears to be no one managing Rose Veranda and no one supervising the floor. A previously good reputation is not an excuse for management to abandon oversight. Even McDonalds has higher standards.The seats are looking shabby and the tables are in desperate need of refurbishment - a disgrace for an outlet that attempts to be up-market.The food manages to claw back some reputation. A small, but reasonable selection of good quality. The restriction to “two types or tea or coffee” from a big selection seems a pointless limit, targeted to annoy clients without any cost benefits.A general disappointment as the Rose Veranda attempts to live on its past glory. No more. This wilted rose is rotting quickly
4
Mum was visiting so we took her to their high tea for her birthday. More like a full meal than the high tea I'm used to but lovely space and amazing array of savoury and sweet food choices with good service.Highly recommended
5
Lots of variety for a high tea buffet! Sashimi was top grade! Hot food and laksa was good! Desserts were the best! Complimentary cake and Polaroid for us (wedding anniversary) made it all the more sweet :)
3
The food was lovely with lots of choices. I loved the little noodle station and the dessert range was beautiful. But our experience at the restaurant was very curious. We are an Australian Indian couple and we visited the restaurant with another Australian (Caucasian) couple. The staff were polite but the service we received was noticeably different from the way our friends were being treated. We were never offered a welcome drink, they got served drinks straight away. We had to ask for the tea menus, they didn't. They were offered validated parking passes, we were never offered any and had to ask for them ourselves. The disparity in service was really strange and I just expected better from the Shangri-La group
2
I attended the high tea with some expectation. Was disapointed at the small range of food available. There was only one soup choice. The mains were not that appealing. The fried chicken wings look recycled. Cake portion was too big and should be smaller to enable diners to sample more varieties. There was only one mango ice cream which tasted artificial. At SGD52++ per head, there are better options elsewhere.
5
Excellent spread with very efficient staff. I like the cosy setting and that the seats were not too close together.
4
Revisited after a couple of years. Service is still impressive. Range of food is not big but suffice to. Among the local Asian offering, the butter chicken is rich and has deep flavour and though the gravy of the signature beef rendang is watery the beef is fork tender and is chock full of collagen as the embedded tendon are melt in your mouth. The deserts are decent. This is not a big place and hence no noisy crowd. This is a good venue to spend a relaxed afternoon and have a tête-à-tête with your girlfriend or have a lazy relaxing afternoon imbibing high tea on your own with a good book
3
I've made a reservation for 2. Been here with a group of friends sometime back. It was a very serene place for high tea when every different tea they served were with gourmet presentation. Even though the spread then was lesser it was of quality. The ambience was still great! There weren't any limitation then that guests can choose from the 164 types of gourmet tea. It was after several types of tea I had, the waitress informed me that each patron is allowed only 2 selections each but they are making an exception for me which I appreciate. Food was alright but not worthy for the price of the high tea. Perhaps marketing would look into that matter. There's no more pretty tea presentations which is the reason I'm back for.

Rose Veranda is literally a restaurant located at a veranda on level 2 of the Shangri la Singapore. The hotel is located along Orange Grove Road, which is not accessible by MRT (Mass Rapid Transit). Best way to get to the Shangri la is either by driving or taxi. For those who choose to drive, be prepared to have umbrellas handy on rainy days. The hotel has an open air carpark and an underground carpark. There is no access to the hotel via the underground carpark. Guests will find themselves walking up the stairwell to the open air carpark area. There is no sheltered walkway from the open air carpark to the hotel lobby.The Rose Veranda provides a very cozy and classy setting. There is not much of a view to the external surroundings of the hotel. Therefore, no particular table is better than another.The spread includes a Japanese corner (various sushi, tuna and salmon sashimi), hot dishes like beef rendang, braised tofu, fried rice, fried chicken wings, samosa, laksa, rack of lamb, rolls and buns (butter available), hot soup, cold dishes including salads, top-shell and torched tuna, and a dessert section offering various cakes, macaroons, chocolate fondue, various mousse and puddings and ice cream. Fruit juice is not available as part of the buffet. Tea and coffee is included. Guests will be spoilt for choice because of the variety of tea the restaurant offers. Your choice of tea will be served in individual pots. Plain water is also available upon request. The spread would be deemed just right, definitely not a wide variety of food.The attentiveness of the staff in waiting is impressive. Good job.I would recommend this venue for a good catchup amongst friends. The restaurant is not big, therefore it is not too noisy. It is also a nice place to bring a date
5
Staff remembers you by name, serves a mini cake with a birthday song for those celebrating. Food variety is not too big buy serves quality food only.grilled beef was perfect. Desserts not to be missed especially the cheesecake.Big selection from the tea menu
5
The buffet at this establishment is not one of the best Singapore has to offer when it comes to high tea indulgence, it is the very best!Expect lavish and comfortable lounge chairs to enjoy your dining experience from here. Enjoy selecting and sampling the complimentary TWG teas. Dress smart casual - this serene room warrants respect. The food is exquisite - from the cheese platters, the sushi, the dim sum, the salad bars, the soups, the fusion Asian-Western dishes will cater to every desire your taste buds crave and the presentation and service is what anyone who can afford this chic form of dining should expect - immaculate and memorable.If you want to impress your peers or close a business deal, if you want to share something truly memorable with a loved one or if you just want to spoil yourself in superb Singapore, make a meal of this place

Looking for High Tea with Buffet for family .....Visit Rose Veranda in soothing ambience to enjoy choice of hot tea from around world.

Great lunch buffet and very reasonably priced. Delicious dessert bar. Tip: you get a 10% discount when making your reservation online

I have been to the rose veranda twice yearly since 3 years ago and noticed that the quality of food has been steadily decreasing. Service and ambience is very lovely.
4
I have been visiting Rose Veranda for the past 5 years. What drew me was the selection of TWG tea and lovely selection of food & desserts. Over the years, the food selection & quality has deteriorated. We used to be able to swop tea flavors but now we are restricted to one type for the entire sitting. The selection of food has decreased and it is still good quality but no outstanding dishes. Good place to hang out though it is not top of the market for value & selection.
5
The high-tea buffet was elegant and had a large variety despite being smaller than a normal lunch buffet. The tea menu is very large as you would expect. Worth a visit.
4
Again, we eat here when staying in the Shangri La hotel.
Good food, good service here , But again, Pricey.
4
Good customer service. Great food variety, esp the tea selections. Lovely environment and decorations.
5
Good service rendered,
Food was not bad.
Thoughtful occasion as car park is free too.
Good varieties of food
5
Amazing high tea.... one if the best in Singapore! Dozens of teas to choose from and the food? Oh my! Delicious and with tremendous variety. Sushi, sashimi, main dishes, breads, cheeses, salads, and the desserts.... everything was absolutely top notch. A bit pricey but worth it. The only complaint: a few more veggie options would have been nice. But again, other than that, a high tea not to be missed.
4
Nothing much to rave about in terms of food as I couldn't identify a dish that really stands out. The spread is comparatively larger as compared to other afternoon teas as they serve Asian hot dishes and sashimi besides the usual cakes and sandwiches. Their extensive tea selection is the highlight of the buffet. Service was impressive as they took effort to replenish food at the buffet table even though the buffet was closing in an hour's time. 45 minutes before closing, staff made the effort to inform guests about last orders and replenished our pots of tea. The sofa seats, soft lighting and beautiful cutlery makes one feel relaxed and want to just sit back to enjoy the afternoon

Pleasantly surprised, even though this was not what we were expecting for high tea. This is a full on lunch buffet! Sushi, roast, laksa, salad, dim sum, etc... The cod dish was delicious!! Excellent service, great value and comfy seating. There is an extensive selection of teas, but I recommend this venue for lunch. It's also a lovely place for a birthday celebration, a personalized mini cheesecake is brought out at the end of the meal, along with a birthday polaroid photo. Lots of natural light in the Rose Veranda- a lovely lunch experience

This was our first visit for me and my wife. She is a fan of high tea and ever since her friend raved about their experience at Rose Veranda, she had been wanting to try out herself. We arrived early sat at the lounge area waiting. When time was up, we were greeted by the friendly staff and ushered to a choice sitting with the view of the waterfall and spread of the buffet line. We did not expect tea accompaniments to go beyond the usual sweet selections. Savories include sushi, cold dishes, dim sum, local delights of Laksa and even a carving station for beef sirloin. Ambience was good for small talk. One of the signature of Rose Veranda is the wide selection of tea blends - 164 types. I had the Shangri-La blend which had a fruity bouquet and light to taste while my wife had her not so adventurous fuller English Breakfast usual - both top 10 popular selections. We have a choice of 2 tea or coffee combination for this tea seating. Overall, we had a good experience with the tea, foof and service by the prompt staff
4
Came here last week with the wife and had a wonderful time. They have a huge variety of teas (think 164 types or thereabouts). The high tea buffet included 2 pots of tea or you can replace it with coffee (refillable) if you wish to. Food was pretty good but the key attraction was 1) the great ambience 2) fantastic service and 3) huge selection of teas
5
If you are a fan of high tea you will enjoy the Rose Veranda in the Shangri La hotel. I love going there especially for birthday celebrations with friends. It does feel special. The high tea spread is lavish - from Asian (laksa, sushi, dim sum etc) to Western (beef wellington, scones, salads, bread and butter pudding) delights. Actually it is so lavish that it is less a tea than a full-on lunch or dinner. In fact you can go in for high tea at noon - sounds incongruous but works for me. The decor is elegant. Tea is served in a large, bright, glass fronted room with a view, with comfortable chairs (although it is a little difficult to eat a lunch/dinner sort of meal on tea tables) that are perfect for happy conversation. Beautiful table linen, crockery and flower arrangements unobtrusively create a cozy cocoon in which to laze away an afternoon or evening. There is a grand selection of teas to choose from. I always go for a Darjeeling-English Breakfast combo but friends have tried more exotic teas. And if you prefer coffee you can drink coffee instead. My only problem with the Rose Veranda has to do with the hotel rather than the tea lounge - the loo is a very long walk away, problematic if there are elderly people in your party. The high tea isn't cheap but is well worth it for a special, slap-up meal
4
Nice and quiet ambience... Lacking some live music but overall good. Food served is similar. No change in menu in the last 4 months
5
After arriving at the Rose Veranda for afternoon Tea, we were shown to our table, which was very nicely laid out.It was laid out Buffet Style, there was so much food to choose from, anything from steak to dim sum and noodles. There was rice dishes and so much more.There was a chocolate fountain with strawberries, cakes and pastries, and homemade chocolates.They gave you a book with loads of diffent teas,from which you were allowed to pick one only. My husband had the chocolate tea, and he enjoyed it very much, but he said the smell was so much better than the taste :o) I think I had a fruity tea, which was very refreshing.The whole experience was very enjoyable, and we would like to thank all the staff for a very memourable afternoon.Best wishesSharon & Jaso

tables are low with low chairs, for people over 1.70m long, it it quite a challenge to finish your meal without back and leg problems . large buffet with lots of calorie bombs in it
5
An amazing New Years buffet and dinner option for our entire family. I could not get over the selection of food provided NYE. And the dessert selection, amazing!
4
Forget the Line. This is quality food without the hustle and bustle (rude visitors lacking manners) crowd you get at the Line downstairs. True you will not get the variety of the Line, but with a fresh seafood selection, roast, Japanese and chocolate fountain, who needs anything more. You'll get a good fill here
3
Went for lunch buffet (first seating). Good ambience & good services but limited spread of food. Salmon / tuna sashimi and the roasted US Prime Ribs are good! For tea lovers, there are a great variety of tea (TWG) to choose from. Unlimited tea & coffee to go with your meal... We ordered the Imperial Jasmine (which was believed to have a history dated back to Song Dynasty) and Imperial Puer to go with our food. I preferred the Jasmine tea. Puer is a little too dark & bitter for me. Relatively good selection of desserts and we especially loved the mango gelato. For the price of $52++, the spread is reasonable although I do hope to see more meat varieties ..
4
Relaxing and classy as always. Just there to celebrate a family birthday. Sipping tea and desserts..
4
Good value considering the ambiance and quality and spread of food. Sashimi was fresh and restocked promptly with good selection of teas and unlimited flow of lattes. Beef wellington was a bit dry and disappointing but thoroughly enjoyed the cakes and pastries as well as the large sweet and sour shrimp at the buffet
1
The laksa was dismal. Hard boiled eggs were not fresh, kitchen ran out of laksa leaves and had the cheek to say that the laksa leaves were added to the gravy! Which respectable Chef would do that? The Chef carving the beef Wellington didn't know it was important for the beef to be wrapped by the pastry shell. Instead he sliced the Wellington with the pastry shell falling off every time. When confronted he was surprised that thus was necessary not just for presentation but also to seal the flavour and moisture of the beef in.
4
Favorite tea venue with girlfriends. October was a breast cancer awareness theme, many foods (mostly desserts were pink). Loved the prime beef on the cart. The lovely chef-Perry was excellent, he was extremely helpful, friendly and very hardworking in ensuring guests were well-serviced. It clearly wasn't his job, but he went the extra mile to ensure everyone was happy. Somehow, there seemed to be lack of waitresses on a Thursday afternoon. Service was very slow. But overall, food was wonderfully presented, refilled very quickly, and as usual, a great place for girlfriends to catch up
5
First time and definitely not that last. Booked the 2nd seating for 3 pax. I must say, Excellent Service, great food, great dessert and wonderful waitress, especially waitress Ms Sasi, who took care of our area!
5
From the fantastic tea selection to lovely variety of savoury and sweet treats, the high tea at Rose Veranda Shangri-La is certainly worth a visit. Very highly recommended! Make sure you say hi to Chef Perry, a gentleman and a Shangri-La veteran!
5
Food was all fantastic, even the Laksa soup was rich and fragrant. Desserts were spectacular, I had 2 servings of the Creme Brulee.
Loved the service and teas as well. All in all a great place.
5
A great and lovely place to chill out. Food for the soul and body. The tranquillity of the place on a weekday is simply therapeutic. The light-footed steps and attention of the waitresses added to the heart-warming experience. Food was good. For about $50 for a high-tea buffet, sure value for money!
4
I didn't tell them it's for my frds birthday celebration,but I tried my luck if it's possible to sing him a song n gave him a cake. they manage to get my frd a birthday cake.. even though its a last min request. The food are fine as usual..been there a lot of times and its always changing menu which is good.However there was a small cockroach found running about on top of a cake.. m not making a big issue here cuz I understand they can be everywhere even in clean spaces...I told a waitresses n she quickly take it away.. they need to be careful if it happen to be someone else they might get some serious complain
5
I like that the lounge was bright and airy with cushy seats. The wait staff was very attentive; they refilled our teapots without us having to prompt them. There was a wide array of food to choose from - unlike the usual high tea which would only have sandwiches/scones/tarts - there was seabass, fried chicken, an amazing selection of desserts and i also loved their buttery scones. Would definitely make this my first choice for my next high tea venue
4
Wonderful service, good atmosphere and a good selection at the buffet. Reservations on the weekend are definitely needed, we were one of half a dozen groups celebrating a birthday. It was very cute as they brought out a cake with a birthday card and of course the obligatory birthday song
4
Had high tea for my birthday on 24th July 2015.....enjoyed the ambience and friendly staffs.Sashimi was fresh and replenished every 5 mins. Instant picture was taken for birthday person and given a piece of birthday cake and also a special cold green tea.It's worth recommending and visit again
5
We really enjoyed our high tea experience at the Rose Verandah. It really was value for money and we ate enough not to have to eat again until the next day. There was plenty of choice and the food was all delicious. The service was professional and respectful
3
If one has afternoon tea at one of the Twg salons, the food and the ambience seems to be special, but the atmosphere at the Shangrila is somewhat ordinary because the restaurants always seem to be over full, and often there are young children screaming or running around. The staff seem to work hard, but one has to ask to have dirty plates taken away or for the soup course or extra hot water for the tea. One would not have to do that at some of the other 5 star hotels in Singapore. When you get to the buffet one finds that at least half the dishes are waiting to be replenished, which means the staff cannot keep up. The only time the serving dishes were full was at 5.30 when the restaurant was about to close. I even had to ask if there was any more cheese, because there was none left. The food is certainly good compared to a hawker centre but unfortunately not up to the usual Shangri-la standards that I experience in other cities. There were one or two good dishes but many are subpar. The bread and butter pudding for example was overcooked. If you compare the bread and butter pudding here with that at the Billiard Room at Raffles, then you will definitely recognise the difference in quality. For these reasons I won't return or recommend, but the hotel won't worry much as the restaurant always seems to be busy
5
Excellent choice of tea, great choice of food, lovely surroundings served up by very friendly staff.
5
One must have high tea at this elegant room, and be pampered by the wide array of delicious morsels. Very relaxing and civilized!
5
Love lunch cum high tea with 100 + range of tea to select from.
Good place to spend time with girls friend
5
It was my 2nd visit to Rose Veranda and like the first visit, everything was perfect! Love the hi tea buffet whereby TWG tea was served and spread was excellent with sushi, seafood, dim sum and macaroons! Even though the place is always packed, service remains top notch with the wait staff constantly clearing our plates and ensuring that our tea are topped up.Definitely worth spending a lazy afternoon here catching up with friends over tasty treats and good quality tea.
4
The perfect place for high tea. The food was delicious and the wait staff most attentive. We also ate lunch there and though the buffet was smaller than the one at the Line, it offered us several choices of local and western cuisine and the setting was a lot quitter than at the Line
5
Service of the level achieved by the staff here is out of the ordinary and made our stay at the Shangri La a memorable one. Despite the breakfast selections being smaller than the noisy restaurant downstairs, The Line, the offer to fetch a dish from there is always made, and you can enjoy all that restaurant's fare without all the bustle. Highly recommended if you like to eat in a quiet, relaxed atmosphere.
4
I was impressed with the food at this buffet. I usually prefer a tea where everything is served at your table on tiered plates, but the options at the Shangri la made up for the buffet atmosphere. Their salads and seafood options stood out along with the desserts. There were several Christmas desserts, which added a nice touch.I wished we could have sampled more teas â€“ you can have an many pots as you want but you can only have one kind per person. If you are a large group you can share. But with only two people you are limited
5
Christmas week started with the delicious High Tea Buffet at Shangri-La's Rose Verandah. As ever the food was top class and the service attentive and charming. Particularly appreciated were the bread and butter pudding and the scones with cream and jam. Very timely reminders of home. The overall ambience was wonderful, although it was slightly disappointing that there was no live piano musi
3
Nice ambience, comfy sofa seats for a leisurely afternoon tea. They have over 100 types of tea for selection. I tried the Shangri-la rose tea, which was rated top 10. Wide selection of hot food, sandwiches and pastries but the quality was disappointing. Nothing memorable. Pastries in particular, were not spectacular for the price. We were served by a Chinese lady who could not pronounce what she was serving and was not able to make recommendations. Quite a let-down for a such a classy hotel
4
The Rose Veranda has the advantage of long operating hours for high tea, and also a good balance of savoury and dessert offerings. It is also a very pleasant and quiet venue; perfect for a quiet conversation or relaxing with a book.The service is impeccable, and we were never left unattended for long. Despite being seated in a deep secluded corner of the restaurant, our servers made frequent rounds to check on us and ensure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed.The food however is lacking in quality and presentation. There is a mix of savoury and desserts, but the presentation on the tables against the wall are unfortunately unappealing. The quality could also be improved to match up to the standards of other high tea buffet spreads of a similar price range
5
Very comfortable chairs, attentive staff, excellent cocktails and a view of the waterfall. What more could you ask?
5
We booked from 3pm onwards, there wasn't a lot of people. Just a couple of groups.Had high tea here with some friends, good value for money food spread. Hot food, there is seafood such as cod fish, fried prawns and mussels. There was sushi as well but we gave that a miss. The sandwiches and wraps were amazing! The dessert bar was definitely the highlight of the day! Tea was refillable and came in a large tea pot.Service staff was friendly and attentive to clear our plates.For the price we paid it was well worth it, plus we used the 15% online booking discount. Will be back again hopefully soon
3
My fren decided to go for hi-tea at Shangri-La Rose Veranda as we find the price is affordable.However, first of all, I find the section that they place the food was rather cramp at a corner against the wall especially the sashimi corner. Selection is very limited and but to me I think is the quality that counts....and I find is average. Well, I guess my reason for returning to this place will be for the ambience rather than the food
4
I decided to bring my hubby and daughter here for hi-tea on a public holiday though I had been here twice with friends. We reserved the first seating at 12. Love the spread and my daughter went for countless rounds of salmon sashimi. It was a super hot day so we were pretty relaxed in here and really enjoyed the spread of hi-tea. Not too heavy for lunch yet just good enough.Will come back again soon
2
I've been to many high teas and this one really do not make it. first is the poor variety of spreads. there is 1 main and 3 other small station. the main station has local food like fried chicken wing, simple dim sum, mee siam, some fried vege and a beef and the rest are sald n fruits.you can get some sushi at one station which is about the size of 2 bread container. the same goes with the bread station. you can't even toast the bread. the last is the ice cream and small desserts corner. that's how pathetic the food are. to make matter worse, you can have only 1 drink each. that is either coffee or tea. the chinese waitress was quite annoy when asked again about the tea selection. there are way better place for high tea. not this one
5
I have been to Rose Veranda many times with friends and family. This is a perfect place to relax and enjoy a lazy afternoon. The ambience is cozy and not too crowded on weekdays. You can select from the list of 160 types of TWG tea or coffee to go with the buffet. The buffet spread is not very extensive but you get quality here, not quantity. My favorite section is the cheese & dessert counters. Good brie & camembert to go with the champagne jelly, heavenly!

For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/02/high-tea-buffet-at-rose-veranda-shangri.htmlThis was around my 5th time to The Rose Veranda. Service was ok but not great. It's nice to see the waitress here were well-groomed!I feel that the quality of the food/dessert was much better the previous times compared to now. Their cakes used to make me WoW last time but not so much now.. Overall still acceptable but this is Shangri-La so we would expect premium quality to complement with this price of $45++ per pax. Overall I really like the cosy and elegant ambience here. Hope they can improve in the food quality and this place will be a perfect venue for high tea
5
Rose veranda is one of the few places that allow you to sit down from 11am - 6pm for tea. All this for about $40 on a weekday. Aside from big comfy chairs to sit on, tables are quite spaced out from each other to ensure privacy while you catch up with your friends.There's a wonderful spread of local delights, sushi, salmon and a roast, sometimes beef, other times, duck. There's also a noodle station which might serve mee siam, soto or laksa. I know because I have been there a few times and they don't seem to have repeated a noodle yet.My favourite, however, is their wide selection of desserts, which are tasty and beautifully presented. Their delicious scones are served with clotted cream, which is hard to come by in Singapore. From time to time, they have durian shortcake or strawberry shortcake, and there's also a chocolate fountain to amuse the kids. There are macaroons, chocolate truffles and trifles. They also rotate their ice cream flavours. I always hope for the yam flavour, though the coconut is great too.The price also comes with a pot of TWG tea which you can keep refilling. My only gripe, however, is that the tea is usually weak.The service staff are likely Korean or Japanese and serve with a smile. One time, my friend's phone ran out of battery, and he was waiting for an important call. He asked one of the waitresses for help, and she helped to find him a charger without hesitation.Do make a reservation way in advance as they are very popular and are almost always fully booked

I had been to The Line for its lunch and dinner. This is my 1st visit to Rose Veranda. There are 2 seating time slots for weekend high tea. 1st seating: 11:30am to 2:30pm; 2nd seating:2:30pm to 5:30pm and we chose the 1st seating. I probably the 1st to arrive as when I was there. The table was not ready. The restaurant only let us in sharp at 11:30am.You will be served complimentary Ice Happy Birthday Tea. This tea is one of the top 10 tea selection at Rose Veranda. I like it. On top of that you can enjoy 1 selection of tea(out of the 164 teas on Rose Veranda Tea Menu) or coffee with free flow. Food overall are quite good but I was quite disappointed with the desserts selection as it didn't have some special stuff that attracted me. All the cakes is quite ordinary, nothing special about the flavour. Other than this, the service was good. I requested a small birthday cake for my friend and they gave it complimentary for that. The staff even sing song for my friend. It came to the hygiene side where I thought they might need to improve. I wasn't too sure whether the area is too dark but I did noticed flies(or some other unknown insects) flying around the tiramisu desserts. It was placed the highest on the day itself.http://rainfooddiary.blogspot.sg/2014/03/rose-veranda.htm

I have periodically been patronizing and enjoying the high tea in the Rose Veranda in Shangri la Hotel for its varied and delicious array of food .. but no longer.The high tea on Sun 23 March was disappointing. The prawn soup noodle really smelt bad, the roast duck on the wagon was not succulent and the sauce - incorrect taste. The mini ngoh hiang rolls were tough – not crispy.The sandwiches too were dry and the scones unappetizing. Fortunately, the large selection of teas, the lamb curry, the sashimi and the cake spread saved the day.Many waitresses could not understand us – really frustrating and reflects badly of a 5 star hotel. As for the decor – it has seen better days. Needs refurbishment.Hope the management will improve on the quality of food served - to justify the price
4
One of the best in the town, you will be satisfied with the food, services and perhaps the ambience compare to other places where they offer the same price but with below average food.
Booking advance is a MUST !

I have been wanting to visit The Rose Verandah for their high-tea, so when the day came for this indulgence, it was an event to look forward to. The name itself exudes old-fashioned class and elegance, and the setting of this place did not disappoint. Elaborate chandelier lamps hanging from high ceilings, lush carpeting and exotic colors fill out a glass, leather and marble dining area that combines vintage "homeliness" with class.A rack of TWG teas greeted us upon entering the restaurant - a happy feeling knowing that The Rose Verandah was serving quality tea. I had the Morning Irish tea - something fragrant and befitting in this lazy Saturday late morning time.The table was elegantly-furnished as well, and the attentive and efficient service crew came over to take our tea orders and serve us a welcome Iced Tea. They also brought over a Cream of Pumpkin soup that was very scrumptious, and also on the house - we were rather delighted with the service and quality freebies.As any good buffet stations, The Rose Verandah has a good array of salads, greens and cold cuts to kickstart off a sumptuous high tea. We were spoilt for choice by the food selection segregated - salads and gado gado, Chinese food like dim-sum, homecook-style chicken etc, Japanese counter, bread counter and desserts station. I lingered for a while before decided to start off with some salads and light items.The first plate I tried was some finger sandwiches, shrimp salads, sauteed mushrooms and smoked salmon with apricot. The fresh and delicious tiny bites teased our appetites and we yearned for more at the end of these light starters.For more detailed information and photos, do drop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/02/high-tea-at-rose-verandah-shangri-la.htm

I regret to say this was probably one of the disappointing experiences i had so far. The savoury sandwiches were uninspired and dry, and the cakes did not meet expectations. The worst experience was the tea it's not even hot its kind a warm. However everything is good the service is superb and the buffet counter is always full and theres a lot of food variety!Visited Dec 201

Afternoon teas in Singapore are much more than any where else I have had teas and I have enjoyed these in many countries. From a choice of hot foods, sandwiches, dim sum, soup to a chocolate fountain, you will leave refreshed. A huge selection of teas and coffee. The ambiance here is lovely as well. Be sure to try this at least once
4
Came here for high-tea and was not disappointed. The variety of tea offered was huge so there has to be one that suits you. Though the thing is that if you chose one, you have to stick with it. A change will incur some costs. The food provided is pretty standard and I would say, there could be more offering. The dessert station is also quite a tough place. Macarons aren't always available and despite sitting right next to the dessert station, we had to keep our eyes sharp for replenishments. Place is beautiful; nice comfy chairs but tables too low. Love the roses all around

Dear F&B Team, Kindly please spare me a few moments of your time to share with you my dining experience at The Rose Veranda at SLS Singapore on the 21st Dec 2013. Our reservation was for the second seating starting at 3pm, and while my friend arrived earlier at 2:55pm there was no dispensation to seat her and she was turned away. This inconvenience caused her to misplace her item (a brown kiehl's bag containing a Chloe perfume as we were doing a gift exchange), in which she had informed the staff. What shocked us the most was the staff made no effort in helping in locating the item and instead simply replied "It depends on what you want to do". Isn't there a process to inform the duty manager or the house keeping staff or someone to help ascertain the item has been found or not. When we asked if its possible to play back the security footage, again there was no clarity in this approach. After we were seated in RV, at approximately 3:30pm (30 mins into the high tea), we were shocked to realize that the sashimi had been depleted. In which we reminded the staff. At 4pm, we again told one staff of our missing item and asked for the assistance of the restaurant manager or the duty manager. But to this we receive no answer even after we had left the establishment and enquired at Guest relations desk ourselves in which we told that no one highlighted or informed of any missing item. Where is the communication amongst the staff? We informed not once, not twice but thrice. But yet the staff all seemed unaware of the situation. In this area, we can safely say that there is no form of concern that this incident had occurred at your establishment. Back to the F&B, at again about 4pm we find that several items are no empty and depleted. Such as the prawns, the dim sum, the sashimi again. Which i personally informed the reception staff, who had promised to inform the kitchen and chef. At 4:30pm, the noodles from the "prawn noodle station" were depleted and so were the condiments such as chilli and shallots. Dessert were no starting to be snatched up! Macarons were no longer in sight, shot glass desserts were left in misery, making the space look desolate and it seemed like a hurricane had just torn through. Dripped chococlate from the fondue, toppings strewn everywhere. At 5pm, the living carving station has "closed"! No chef is position there to offer assistance in this area. Food were already more or less being unattended to. We waited for almost 30mins for a replenishment of tea. Used plates at our table are left uncleared for a good 10mins in which we see no choice but to leave them by the side table with the lamp. Instead staff are walking around offering "special" mushroom soup???Instead the focus is to offer what is promised and to maintain the minimal standard. Please do not attempt to soar and go beyong by making fine personal touches when you could hardly even maintain the minimal standard of a Shang dining experience. I can understand that the management looks into hiring foreign talents but kindly please educate them in the finer touches of fine dining or at least etiquette. The filipino, korean and chinese that served us makes no acknowledgement to have our plates cleared and just silently removes them, for an instance my friend hasn't even finshed her food and it was "mysteriously" taken away. Other times we had to signal for their attention to get some form of service. I can understand that they may be overwhelmed by the large numbers of diners, but the managment may consider hiring more or increasing numbers or in fact deploy the duty manager or other F&B staff to assist in the demands. Overall, it was a horrible experience and definitely not worth a re-visit. Shangri La Singapore has definitely accomplished the destruction of the Shangri La Brand of not only exquisite service but also a good dining experience. I can safely equate your Rose Veranda establishment to Newton Circus, the only difference is Newton food centre has no air-con and the staff are not wearing cheongsam

Did High Tea at the 3-6pm slot last Sunday. The Rose Verandah is a lovely area upstairs in the Shangri La with very comfy chairs. Great assortment of hot international foods as well as all the regular cold meats, salads, sandwiches, cheeses. And then the sweets......never seen so many varieties at one hotel! And they tasted as good as they looked. Tried 3 different pots of hot teas. All different but flavorsome. Service by staff was excellent. A really nice relaxing afternoon in a beautiful setting.

I was in Singapore with work colleagues and we wanted to experience high tea. We were lucky and managed to at last minute to get a table at rose verandah.Gorgeous hotel foyer that results in a lovely experience reaching the 'verandah'. Beautiful rose decorations and view over the hotel waterfall.The food was very nice with the dessert range stunning. It was really more a lovely general Buffett which suited us in the end as it was late lunch early afternoon tea mixed for us. Nice table setting, china and good service. In the end it wasn't the traditional high tea I was hoping for, BUT it was certainly worth it and was a reasonable price. Plus as mentioned desserts were ....a treat:-
5
Yes, the Rose Veranda is definitely the place to go for a long leisurely afternoon tea with friends. The relaxing green view through the full-length glass-panel walls settles one in a garden atmosphere even as one sinks into the over-stuffed armchairs. The service by the elegant cheongsam-clad waitresses and uniformed chef at the roast trolley is attentive and friendly. The selection from 164 teas is surely astounding, and the Shangri-La blend and Weekend in Moscow are as exotic in taste as they sound.The food for high tea is a good spread of Western and Eastern that might include varieties of salads and appetizers, dimsum and sushi, stir-fried beef and poached salmon, laksa or tomyam noodles, as well as delectable desserts- cakes, jellies and mousses, cookies and macarons, ice-cream and a chocolate fountain to dip cut fruits in.What more could one ask for (perhaps some sashimi) to while away an afternoon in genteel company
5
I brought my 94 year old grandmother there for an early tea and their care and service were excellent. Food (ranging from Japanese, Singapore to Western) was of a high standard except for their desserts which they really needed to work on. One particular chef took extra care of us. I am uncertain if he is the head chef but he was wonderful!
3
My mother loves her high tea. I brought her here for an afternoon tea on one Saturday.
Nothing special with the food, but it has many tea choices.
3
A great little buffet (for lunch anyway). The problem was the tables and chairs are low making it difficult for those more advanced in years to get up to select the great food on offer.
5
Not to be missed. I didn't know what not to eat! The dessert table is bountiful and everything I tried was top notch. The Singapore Laksa is must try too.
5
One of the best high teas in Singapore - one for the bucket list. Wonderful food and service by the beautiful, elegant and charming Singaporean staff.

I've attended a mid-day wedding at Shangri-La where the reception was also held at the Rose Veranda. The servers were nice, warm and accommodating. There's wide buffet spread but I only had Japanese food because I had no appetite yet to eat as I work night shift, It's good and salmon sashimi was soo fresh. For the desserts, I had tiramisu and marshmallows/strawberry dipped in chocolate. Nice as well. I'll come back here!My only unpleasant experience was when I arrived at Shangri-La Hotel and asked for the Pink Magnolia Room from the host/staff (Zurra) assigned in the hotel entrance. No smile nor greetings, and the feeling was not welcoming. She told me that Pink Magnolia Rm was just one level up, just take an escalator. I asked for specific room but was given general direction, in the end, I get lost and walked all the way to the toilet at the other end where in fact the room was just exactly above the staff's location. I asked from another staff, he walked with me all the way to the room. Anyway, this will not affect my pleasant experience at Rose Veranda.
4
Pleasantly surprised when my husband & I went there one week-day afternoon. I'd missed the traditional high tea experience where you nibbled on delicate cakes and sipped tea from fine china and used good quality flatware and starched linen napkins. Service was attentive but unobstrusive and the ambience was totally luxurious and relaxing. The food was good too - thumbs up to the laksa, sashimi & macaroons. Totally going back

We booked a table for 9 to celebrate a birthday. The reception area at front of restaurant was terrible. It wasn't clear where the queue was though there were a number of people gathered in front of the service staff. We didn't know if we should approach the staff or to just wait behind the mass of people (and we had a reservation.) The staff's attitude was not entirely welcoming too. The food was good and I like the dessert variety. But the waitress did forget our drinks a couple of times. We had to remind her 3 times about a particular drink. The chairs while comfy were low and the arrangement was such there was no space at all between each chair hence anytime one person wanted to get food a few would invariable have to move ( the heavy chairs) to enable her to get out. Overall not so pleasant considering the price we were paying.

We were lucky to be treated to brunch here last Sunday by friends who were leaving Singapore. It was a lovely surprise, just a shame we had to say goodbye to them at the end.The Rose Veranda in the Shangri-La is the perfect place to go for peace & quiet, great food and good service. Its classic décor with cheongsam dressed women make for a relaxing brunch. The buffet food covers excellent fresh sashimi and sushi, fresh salads, with Chinese selections like dim sum. The mains were varied and delicious. I particularly loved the butter chicken and sea bass. The puddings were brilliant (my husband’s favourite) with plenty of choice. We loved the crème brulee, bread and butter pudding, tiramisu and chocolate mousse. I would recommend coming here for a birthday (as you get a little cake and the staff all sing happy birthday) as well as a family gathering. There were two birthday parties when we were there.I would definitely love to come back again

I have been a great supporter of Shangri la hotel and adore its serenity. One of my favorites would be Rose Veranda. They serve high tea in two sessions, 12-3 or 3-6. I usually opt for the latter as I get to sneak in another half an hour or so. I was initially disturbed by some issues that happened in the restaurant quite a while ago, but then, the asst director of f&b - Suzie, along with the restaurant mgr Sherine, helped to clarify those matters and things were eventually resolved. Spread at the rose veranda were not extensive but I dare say the quality has been well maintained. Firstly, you get hundreds of quality tea to choose from - TWG, served in your personal pot. Next, they have nice selection of local delicacies - the laksa has very good soup base and ingredients are fresh. Best of all, you get to mix and cook it yourself! It's pretty fun. Lastly, dessert are well stocked with a good mix. They never fail to brighten your day if you are celebrating a special occasion such as birthdays. Staff come to sing and clap (awkward at times.... If you are the low profile individuals), presenting you with a nice cake! Well, for regular visitor like myself, food variety doesn't seem to present much of a surprise. Even for my visit last Sunday - Easter, it wasn't truly Easter and ambience pales in comparison to other places where we get to see bunny mascots.. But I guess it doesn't gel well with the slightly matured crowd.... Well, I will still choose to visit Rose veranda and thanks for surprising me with the nice greeting card! And yes, I am pleased to be back to Rose Veranda again! All the best to Suzie, as I have heard that you have been promoted to director of f&b at Rasa sentosa, Singapore. Best wishes S

If you are looking for some quiet and peace away from the bustling streets on a weekday off work, Rose Veranda is the perfect place to go. Shuttle service leaves exactly on the hour from Shangri-La Hotel and makes a loop around Traders Singapore, Wisma Atria taxi stand and Takashimaya. Located on the Mezzanine floor (level 4) of the hotel, the outlet sits on top of its sister Lobby Court outlet and boasts of ceiling-to-floor windows overlooking the pool. Upon seating, expect impeccable service from the cheongsam clad ladies. Buffet prices include a selection from their 160+ (if im not wrong) TWG teas and a welcome cold beverage. We left the choice of tea to the service staff who recommended a sweet scented Geisha Blossom Tea - perfect! Food selection was of sufficient varieties without being too overwhelming. We dug into fresh sashimi and sushi from the sushi counter, and fresh salads with an array of extravagant dressings. A variety of roasts were available - do request and the chef will carve out a piece for you. There were also chinese selections such as dim sum and other veggie dishes. Of course, leave space to try their desserts! Notable were the vanilla ice cream, chocolate mousses and a wolfberry jelly. While the dining experience was enjoyable, we did feel that it was rather hard to get the attention of the service staff. But that aside, they were all very friendly and helpful. Will be back
